to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
state
of
the
union
is
sound
our
economy
is
recovering
from
a
recession
a
national
energy
plan
is
in
place
and
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
is
decreasing
we
have
been
at
peace
for
four
uninterrupted
years
but
our
nation
has
serious
problems
inflation
and
unemployment
are
unacceptably
high
the
world
oil
market
is
increasingly
tight
there
are
trouble
spots
throughout
the
world
and
american
hostages
are
being
held
in
iran
against
international
law
and
against
every
precept
of
human
affairs
however
i
firmly
believe
that
as
a
result
of
the
progress
made
in
so
many
domestic
and
international
areas
over
the
past
four
years
our
nation
is
stronger
wealthier
more
compassionate
and
freer
than
it
was
four
years
ago
i
am
proud
of
that
fact
and
i
believe
the
congress
should
be
proud
as
well
for
so
much
of
what
has
been
accomplished
over
the
past
four
years
has
been
due
to
the
hard
work
insights
and
cooperation
of
congress
i
applaud
the
congress
for
its
efforts
and
its
achievements
in
this
state
of
the
union
message
i
want
to
recount
the
achievements
and
progress
of
the
last
four
years
and
to
offer
recommendations
to
the
congress
for
this
year
while
my
term
as
president
will
end
before
the
th
congress
begins
its
work
in
earnest
i
hope
that
my
recommendations
will
serve
as
a
guide
for
the
direction
this
country
should
take
so
we
build
on
the
record
of
the
past
four
years
record
of
progress
when
i
took
office
our
nation
faced
a
number
of
serious
domestic
and
international
problems
no
national
energy
policy
existed
and
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
was
rapidly
increasing
public
trust
in
the
integrity
and
openness
of
the
government
was
low
the
federal
government
was
operating
inefficiently
in
administering
essential
programs
and
policies
major
social
problems
were
being
ignored
or
poorly
addressed
by
the
federal
government
our
defense
posture
was
declining
as
a
result
of
a
defense
budget
which
was
continuously
shrinking
in
real
terms
the
strength
of
the
nato
alliance
needed
to
be
bolstered
tensions
between
israel
and
egypt
threatened
another
middle
east
war
and
americas
resolve
to
oppose
human
rights
violations
was
under
serious
question
over
the
past
months
clear
progress
has
been
made
in
solving
the
challenges
we
found
in
january
of
almost
all
of
our
comprehensive
energy
program
have
been
enacted
and
the

has
been
established
to
administer
the

confidence
in
the

integrity
has
been
restored
and
respect
for
the
governments
openness
and
fairness
has
been
renewed
the
government
has
been
made
more
effective
and
efficient
the
civil

system
was
completely
reformed
for
the
first
time
this
century

initiatives
have
been
proposed
to
the

two
new

been
placed
in
each

has
been
reformed
through

been
established
to
assure

are
being
deregulated
critical
social
problems
many
long
ignored
by
the
federal
government
have
been
addressed
directly
an
urban
policy
was
developed
and
implemented
to
reverse
the
decline
in
our
urban
areas
the
social
security
system
was
refinanced
to
put
it
on
a
sound
financial
basis
the
humphreyhawkins
full

act
was
enacted
federal
assistance
for

was
expanded
by
more
than
percent
the

was
increased
to
levels
needed
to
ease
the
effects
of

affirmative
action
has
been
pursued
aggressively
more
blacks
hispanics
and
women
have
been
appointed
to
senior
government
positions
and
to
judgeships
than
at
any
other
time
in
our
history
the
era
ratification

more

first
sectoral

were
put
in
place
for

with
my

demonstrating
the
value
of
cooperation
between
the
government
business
and
labor
reversing
previous
trends
real
defense
spending
has
increased
every
year
since
the
real
increase
in
fy
defense
spending
is
well
above
percent
and
i
expect
fy
defense
spending
to
be
even
higher
looking
ahead
the
defense
program
i
am
proposing
is
premised
on
a
real
increase
in
defense
spending
over
the
next
five
years
of
percent
or
more
the
nato
alliance
has
proven
its
unity
in
responding
to
the
situations
in
eastern
europe
and
southwest

and
in
agreeing
on
the
issues
to
be

the

in

established
at

and
by

between

is
being
buttressed
on
two
fronts
steady
progress
in
the
normalization
of
egyptianisraeli
relations
in
many
fields
and
the
commitment
of
both
egypt
and
israel
with

assistance
to
see
through
to
successful
conclusion
the
autonomy
negotiations
for
the
west

and
gaza
the
panama
canal
treaties
have
been
put
into
effect
which
has
helped
to
improve
relations
with
latin
america
we
have
continued
this
nations
strong
commitment
to
the
pursuit
of
human
rights
throughout
the
world
evenhandedly
and
objectively
our
commitment
to
a
worldwide
human
rights
policy
has
remained
firm
and
many
other
countries
have
given
high
priority
to
it
our
resolve
to
oppose
aggression
such
as
the
illegal
invasion
of
the
soviet
union
into
afghanistan
has
been
supported
by
tough
action
i
ensuring
economic
strength
economy
during
the
last
decade
our
nation
has
withstood
a
series
of
economic
shocks
unprecedented
in
peacetime
the
most
dramatic
of
these
has
been
the
explosive
increases
of
opec
oil
prices
but
we
have
also
faced
world
commodity
shortages
natural
disasters
agricultural
shortages
and
major
challenges
to
world
peace
and
security
our
ability
to
deal
with
these
shocks
has
been
impaired
because
of
a
decrease
in
the
growth
of
productivity
and
the
persistence
of
underlying
inflationary
forces
built
up
over
the
past
years
nevertheless
the
economy
has
proved
to
be
remarkably
resilient
real
output
has
grown
at
an
average
rate
of
percent
per
year
since
i
took
office
and
employment
has
grown
by
percent
we
have
added
about
million
productive
private
sector
jobs
to
the
economy
however
unacceptably
high
inflationthe
most
difficult
economic
problem
i
have
facedpersists
this
inflationwhich
threatens
the
growth
productivity
and
stability
of
our
economyrequires
that
we
restrain
the
growth
of
the
budget
to
the
maximum
extent
consistent
with
national
security
and
human
compassion
i
have
done
so
in
my
earlier
budgets
and
in
my
fy
budget
however
while
restraint
is
essential
to
any
appropriate
economic
policy
high
inflation
cannot
be
attributed
solely
to
government
spending
the
growth
in
budget
outlays
has
been
more
the
result
of
economic
factors
than
the
cause
of
them
we
are
now
in
the
early
stages
of
economic
recovery
following
a
short
recession
typically
a
postrecessionary
period
has
been
marked
by
vigorous
economic
growth
aided
by
antirecessionary
policy
measures
such
as
large
tax
cuts
or
big
stimulation
spending
programs
i
have
declined
to
recommend
such
actions
to
stimulate
economic
activity
because
the
persistent
inflationary
pressures
that
beset
our
economy
today
dictate
a
restrained
fiscal
policy
accordingly
i
am
asking
the
congress
to
postpone
until
january
the
personal
tax
reductions
i
had
earlier
proposed
to
take
effect
on
january
of
this
year
however
my
budget
proposes
significant
tax
changes
to
increase
the
sources
of
financing
for
business
investment
while
emphasizing
the
need
for
continued
fiscal
restraint
this
budget
takes
the
first
major
step
in
a
longterm
tax
reduction
program
designed
to
increase
capital
formation
the
failure
of
our
nations
capital
stock
to
grow
at
a
rate
that
keeps
pace
with
its
labor
force
has
clearly
been
one
cause
of
our
productivity
slowdown
higher
investment
rates
are
also
critically
needed
to
meet
our
nations
energy
needs
and
to
replace
energyinefficient
plants
and
equipment
with
new
energysaving
physical
plants
the
level
of
investment
that
is
called
for
will
not
occur
in
the
absence
of
policies
to
encourage
it
therefore
my
budget
proposes
a
major
liberalization
of
tax
allowances
for
depreciation
as
well
as
simplified
depreciation
accounting
increasing
the
allowable
rates
by
about
percent
i
am
also
proposing
improvements
in
the
investment
tax
credit
making
it
refundable
to
meet
the
investment
needs
of
firms
with
no
current
earnings
these
two
proposals
along
with
carefullyphased
tax
reductions
for
individuals
will
improve
both
economic
efficiency
and
tax
equity
i
urge
the
congress
to
enact
legislation
along
the
lines
and
timetable
i
have
proposed
the
budget
the
fy
budget
i
have
sent
to
the
congress
continues
our
fouryear
policy
of
prudence
and
restraint
while
the
budget
deficits
during
my
term
are
higher
than
i
would
have
liked
their
size
is
determined
for
the
most
part
by
economic
conditions
and
in
spite
of
these
conditions
the
relative
size
of
the
deficit
continues
to
decline
in
before
i
took
office
the
budget
deficit
equalled
percent
of
gross
national
product
it
had
been
cut
to
percent
in
the
fiscal
year
just
ended
my
budget
contains
a
deficit
estimated
to
be
less
than
percent
of
our
gross
national
product
the
rate
of
growth
in
federal
spending
has
been
held
to
a
minimum
nevertheless
outlays
are
still
rising
more
rapidly
than
many
had
anticipated
the
result
of
many
powerful
forces
in
our
society
we
face
a
threat
to
our
security
as
events
in
afghanistan
the
middle
east
and
eastern
europ
e
make
clear
we
have
a
steadily
aging
population
and
as
a
result
the
biggest
single
increase
in
the
federal
budget
is
the
rising
cost
of
retirement
programs
particularly
social
security
we
face
other
important
domestic
needs
to
continue
responsibility
for
the
disadvantaged
to
provide
the
capital
needed
by
our
cities
and
our
transportation
systems
to
protect
our
environment
to
revitalize
american
industry
and
to
increase
the
export
of
american
goods
and
services
so
essential
to
the
creation
of
jobs
and
a
trade
surplus
yet
the
federal
government
itself
may
not
always
be
the
proper
source
of
such
assistance
for
example
it
must
not
usurp
functions
if
they
can
be
more
appropriately
decided
upon
managed
and
financed
by
the
private
sector
or
by
state
and
local
governments
my
administration
has
always
sought
to
consider
the
proper
focus
of
responsibility
for
the
most
efficient
resolution
of
problems
we
have
also
recognized
the
need
to
simplify
the
system
of
grants
to
state
and
local
governments
i
have
again
proposed
several
grant
consolidations
in
the
budget
including
a
new
proposal
that
would
consolidate
several
highway
programs
the
pressures
for
growth
in
federal
use
of
national
resources
are
great
my
administration
has
initiated
many
new
approaches
to
cope
with
these
pressures
we
started
a
multiyear
budget
system
and
we
began
a
system
for
controlling
federal
credit
programs
yet
in
spite
of
increasing
needs
to
limit
spending
growth
we
have
consistently
adhered
to
these
strong
budget
principles
our
nations
armed
forces
must
always
stand
sufficiently
strong
to
deter
aggression
and
to
assure
our
security
an
effective
national
energy
plan
is
essential
to
increase
domestic
production
of
oil
and
gas
to
encourage
conservation
of
our
scarce
energy
resources
to
stimulate
conversion
to
more
abundant
fuels
and
to
reduce
our
trade
deficit
the
essential
human
needs
for
our
citizens
must
be
given
the
highest
priority
the
federal
government
must
lead
the
way
in
investment
in
the
nations
technological
future
the
federal
government
has
an
obligation
to
nurture
and
protect
our
environmentthe
common
resource
birthright
and
sustenance
of
the
american
people
my
budget
continues
to
support
these
principles
it
also
proposes
responsible
tax
reductions
to
encourage
a
more
productive
economy
and
adequate
funding
of
our
highest
priority
programs
within
an
overall
policy
of
constraint
fiscal
restraint
must
be
continued
in
the
years
ahead
budgets
must
be
tight
enough
to
convince
those
who
set
wages
and
prices
that
the
federal
government
is
serious
about
fighting
inflation
but
not
so
tight
as
to
choke
off
all
growth
careful
budget
policy
should
be
supplemented
by
other
measures
designed
to
reduce
inflation
at
lower
cost
in
lost
output
and
employment
these
other
steps
include
measures
to
increase
investmentsuch
as
the
tax
proposals
included
in
my
budgetand
measures
to
increase
competition
and
productivity
in
our
economy
voluntary
incomes
policies
can
also
directly
influence
wages
and
prices
in
the
direction
of
moderation
and
thereby
bring
inflation
down
faster
and
at
lower
cost
to
the
economy
through
a
taxbased
incomes
policy
tip
we
could
provide
tax
incentives
for
firms
and
workers
to
moderate
their
wage
and
price
increases
in
the
coming
years
control
of
federal
expenditures
can
make
possible
periodic
tax
reductions
the
congress
should
therefore
begin
now
to
evaluate
the
potentialities
of
a
tip
program
so
that
when
the
next
round
of
tax
reductions
is
appropriate
a
tip
program
will
be
seriously
considered
employment
during
the
last
four
years
we
have
given
top
priority
to
meeting
the
needs
of
workers
and
providing
additional
job
opportunities
to
those
who
seek
work
since
the
end
of
almost

new
jobs
have
been
added
to
the
nations
economy

employment
has
reached

more
jobs
than
ever
before

held
by
women

young

four

increased

for

more

trade
over
the
past
year
the
us
trade
picture
improved
as
a
result
of
solid
export
gains
in
both
manufactured
and
agricultural
products
agricultural
exports
reached
a
new
record
of
over
billion
while
manufactured
exports
have
grown
by
percent
to
a
record
billion
in
these
areas
the
united
states
recorded
significant
surpluses
of
billion
and
billion
respectively
while
our
oil
imports
remained
a
major
drain
on
our
foreign
exchange
earnings
that
drain
was
somewhat
moderated
by
a
percent
decline
in
the
volume
of
oil
imports
us
trade
negotiators
made
significant
progress
over
the
past
year
in
assuring
effective
implementation
of
the
agreements
negotiated
during
the
tokyo
round
of
multilateral
trade
negotiations
agreements
reached
with
the
japanese
government
for
example
will
assure
that
the
united
states
will
be
able
to
expand
its
exports
to
the
japanese
market
in
such
key
areas
as
telecommunications
equipment
tobacco
and
lumber
efforts
by
us
trade
negotiators
also
helped
to
persuade
a
number
of
key
developing
countries
to
accept
many
of
the
nontariff
codes
negotiated
during
the
multilateral
trade
negotiations
this
will
assure
that
these
countries
will
increasingly
assume
obligations
under
the
international
trading
system
a
difficult
world
economic
environment
posed
a
challenge
for
the
management
of
trade
relations
us
trade
negotiators
were
called
upon
to
manage
serious
sectoral
problems
in
such
areas
as
steel
and
helped
to
assure
that
us
chemical
exports
will
have
continued
access
to
the
european
market
close
consultations
with
the
private
sector
in
the
united
states
have
enabled
us
trade
negotiators
to
pinpoint
obstacles
to
us
trade
in
services
and
to
build
a
basis
for
future
negotiations
services
have
been
an
increasingly
important
source
of
export
earnings
for
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
must
assure
continued
and
increased
access
to
foreign
markets
the
trade
position
of
the
united
states
has
improved
but
vigorous
efforts
are
needed
in
a
number
of
areas
to
assure
continued
market
access
for
us
exports
particularly
agricultural
and
high
technology
products
in
which
the
united
states
continues
to
have
a
strong
competitive
edge
continued
efforts
are
also
needed
to
remove
many
domestic
disincentives
which
now
hamper
us
export
growth
and
we
must
ensure
that
countries
do
not
manipulate
investment
or
impose
investment
performance
requirements
which
distort
trade
and
cost
us
jobs
in
this
country
in
short
we
must
continue
to
seek
freebut
fairtrade
that
is
the
policy
my
administration
has
pursued
from
the
beginning
even
in
areas
where
foreign
competition
has
clearly
affected
our
domestic
industry
in
the
steel
industry
for
instance
we
have
put
trigger
price
mechanism
into
place
to
help
prevent
the
dumping
of
steel
that
action
has
strengthened
the
d
omestic
steel
industry
in
the
automobile
industry
we
have
worked
without
resort
to
import
quotasto
strengthen
the
industrys
ability
to
modernize
and
compete
effectively
small
business
i
have
often
said
that
there
is
nothing
small
about
small
business
in
america
these
firms
account
for
nearly
onehalf
our
gross
national
product
over
half
of
new
technology
and
much
more
than
half
of
the
jobs
created
by
industry
because
this
sector
of
the
economy
is
the
very
lifeblood
of
our
national
economy
we
have
done
much
together
to
improve
the
competitive
climate
for
smaller
firms
these
concerted
efforts
have
been
an
integral
part
of
my
program
to
revitalize
the
economy
they
include
my
campaign
to
shrink
substantially
the
cash
and
time
consuming
red
tape
burden
imposed
on
business
they
include
my
personallydirected
policy
of
ambitiously
increasing
the
federal
contracting
dollars
going
to
small
firms
especially
those
owned
by
women
and
minorities
and
they
include
my
proposals
to
reinvigorate
existing
small
businesses
and
assist
the
creation
of
new
ones
through
tax
reform
financing
assistance
market
expansion
and
support
of
product
innovation
many
of
my
initiatives
to
facilitate
the
creation
and
growth
of
small
businesses
were
made
in
response
to
the
white
house
conference
on
small
business
which
i
convened
my
administration
began
the
implementation
of
most
of
the
ideas
produced
last
year
by
that
citizens
advisory
body
others
need
to
be
addressed
i
have
proposed
the
reconvening
of
the
conference
next
year
to
review
progress
reassess
priorities
and
set
new
goals
in
the
interim
i
hope
that
the
incoming
administration
and
the
new
congress
will
work
with
the
committee
i
have
established
to
keep
these
business
development
ideas
alive
and
help
implement
conference
recommendations
minority
business
one
of
the
most
successful
developments
of
my
administration
has
been
the
growth
and
strengthening
of
minority
business
this
is
the
first
administration
to
put
the
issue
on
the
policy
agenda
as
a
matter
of
major
importance
to
implement
the
results
of
our
early
efforts
in
this
field
i
submitted
legislation
to
congress
designed
to
further
the
development
of
minority
business
we
have
reorganized
the
office
of
minority
business
into
the
minority
business
development
administration
in
the
department
of
commerce
mbda
has
already
proven
to
be
a
major
factor
in
assisting
minority
businesses
to
achieve
equitable
competitive
positions
in
the
marketplace
the
federal
governments
procurement
from
minorityowned
firms
has
nearly
tripled
since
i
took
office
federal
deposits
in
minorityowned
banks
have
more
than
doubled
and
minority
ownership
of
radio
and
television
stations
has
nearly
doubled
the
sba
administered
a
pilot
program
for
procurement
with
the
army
proved
to
be
successful
and
i
recently
expanded
the
number
of
agencies
involved
to
include
nasa
and
the
departments
of
energy
and
transportation
i
firmly
believe
the
critical
path
to
full
freedom
and
equality
for
americas
minorities
rests
with
the
ability
of
minority
communities
to
participate
competitively
in
the
free
enterprise
system
i
believe
the
government
has
a
fundamental
responsibility
to
assist
in
the
development
of
minority
business
and
i
hope
the
progress
made
in
the
last
four
years
will
continue
ii
creating
energy
security
since
i
took
office
my
highest
legislative
priorities
have
involved
the
reorientation
and
redirection
of
us
energy
activities
and
for
the
first
time
to
establish
a
coordinated
national
energy
policy
the
struggle
to
achieve
that
policy
has
been
long
and
difficult
but
the
accomplishments
of
the
past
four
years
make
clear
that
our
country
is
finally
serious
about
the
problems
caused
by
our
overdependence
on
foreign
oil
our
progress
should
not
be
lost
we
must
rely
on
and
encourage
multiple
forms
of
energy
productioncoal
crude
oil
natural
gas
solar
nuclear
syntheticsand
energy
conservation
the
framework
put
in
place
over
the
last
four
years
will
enable
us
to
do
this
national
energy
policy
as
a
result
of
actions
my
administration
and
the
congress
have
taken
over
the
past
four
years
our
country
finally
has
a
national
energy
policy
under
my
program
of
phased
decontrol
domestic
crude

will
end
september
as
a
result
exploratory

incentives
have
been
increased
and
coal

is
now
at
its
highest
level
in

has
been
approved
by
congress
for
possible
use
in
the
event
of
a
severe
energy
supply
shortage
or

gasohol
production
has
been
dramatically
increased
with
a

being
put
in
place
to
produce

have
been
provided
for

the
past
four
years
increased
development
of
domestic
energy
sources
although
it
is
essential
that
the
nation
reduce
its
dependence
on
imported
fossil
fuels
and
complete
the
transition
to
reliance
on
domestic
renewable
sources
of
energy
it
is
also
important
that
this
transition
be
accomplished
in
an
orderly
economic
and
environmentally
sound
manner
to
this
end
the
administration
has
launched
several
initiatives
leasing
of
oil
and
natural
gas
on
federal
lands
particularly
the
outer
continental
shelf
has
been
accelerated
at
the
same
time
as
the
administration
has
reformed
leasing
procedures
through
the
amendments
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
in
the
interior
department
held
six
ocs
lease
sales
the
greatest
number
ever
which
resulted
in
federal
receipts
of
billion
another
record
the
fiveyear
ocs
leasing
schedule
was
completed
requiring
sales
over
the
next
five
years
since
no
general
federal
coal
lease
sales
were
suspended
over
the
past
four
years
the
administration
has
completely
revised
the
federal
coal
leasing
program
to
bring
it
into
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
federal
land
planning
and
management
act
and
other
statutory
provisions
the
program
is
designed
to
balance
the
competing
interests
that
affect
resource
development
on
public
lands
and
to
ensure
that
adequate
supplies
of
coal
will
be
available
to
meet
national
needs
as
a
result
the
first
general
competitive
federal
coal
lease
sale
in
ten
years
will
be
held
this
month
in
july
i
signed
into
law
the
energy
security
act
of
which
established
the
synthetic
fuels
corporation
the
corporation
is
designed
to
spur
the
development
of
commercial
technologies
for
production
of
synthetic
fuels
such
as
liquid
and
gaseous
fuels
from
coal
and
the
production
of
oil
from
oil
shale
the
act
provides
the
corporation
with
an
initial
billion
to
accomplish
these
objectives
the
principal
purpose
of
the
legislation
is
to
ensure
that
the
nation
will
have
available
in
the
late
s
the
option
to
undertake
commercial
development
of
synthetic
fuels
if
that
becomes
necessary
the
energy
security
act
also
provides
significant
incentives
for
the
development
of
gasohol
and
biomass
fuels
thereby
enhancing
the
nations
supply
of
alternative
energy
sources
commitment
to
a
sustainable
energy
future
the
administrations
national
energy
plan
marked
an
historic
departure
from
the
policies
of
previous
administrations
the
plan
stressed
the
importance
of
both
energy
production
and
conservation
to
achieving
our
ultimate
national
goal
of
relying
primarily
on
secure
sources
of
energy
the
national
energy
plan
made
energy
conservation
a
cornerstone
of
our
national
energy
policy
in
i
initiated
the
administrations
solar
domestic
policy
review
this
represented
the
first
step
towards
widespread
introduction
of
renewable
energy
sources
into
the
nations
economy
as
a
result
of
the
review
i
issued
the
solar
message
to
congress
the
first
such
message
in
the
nations
history
the
message
outlined
the
administrations
solar
program
and
established
an
ambitious
national
goal
for
the
year
of
obtaining
percent
of
this
nations
energy
from
solar
and
renewable
sources
the
thrust
of
the
federal
solar
program
is
to
help
industry
develop
solar
energy
sources
by
emphasizing
basic
research
and
development
of
solar
technologies
which
are
not
currently
economic
such
as
photovoltaics
which
generate
energy
directly
from
the
sun
at
the
same
time
through
tax
incentives
education
and
the
solar
energy
and
energy
conservation
bank
the
solar
program
seeks
to
encourage
state
and
local
governments
industry
and
our
citizens
to
expand
their
use
of
solar
and
renewable
resource
technologies
currently
available
as
a
result
of
these
policies
and
programs
the
energy
efficiency
of
the
american
economy
has
improved
markedly
and
investments
in
renewable
energy
sources
have
grown
significantly
it
now
takes
percent
less
energy
to
produce
a
constant
dollar
of
gnp
than
it
did
in
january
this
increase
in
efficiency
represents
a
savings
of
over
million
barrels
per
day
of
oil
equivalent
about
the
level
of
total
oil
production
now
occurring
in
alaska
over
the
same
period
federal

commitment
to
nuclear
safety
and

since
january
significant
progress
has
been
achieved
in
resolving
three
critical
problems
resulting
from
the
use
of
nuclear
energy
radioactive
waste
management
nuclear
safety
and
weapons
proliferation
in
the
administration
announced
its
nuclear
nonproliferation
policy
and
initiated
the
international
fuel
cycle
evaluation
in
congress
passed
the
nuclear
nonproliferation
act
an
historic
piece
of
legislation
in
february
the
administration
transmitted
its
nuclear
waste
management
policy
to
the
congress
this
policy
was
a
major
advance
over
all
previous
efforts
the
principal
aspects
of
that
policy
are
acknowledging
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
and
the
numerous
technical
and
institutional
issues
adopting
a
technically
and
environmentally
conservative
approach
to
the
first
permanent
repository
and
providing
the
states
with
significant
involvement
in
nuclear
waste
disposal
decisions
by
creating
the
state
planning
council
while
much
of
the
plan
can
be
and
is
being
implemented
administratively
some
new
authorities
are
needed
the
congress
should
give
early
priority
to
enacting
provisions
for
awayfromreactor
storage
and
the
state
planning
council
the
accident
at
three
mile
island
made
the
nation
acutely
aware
of
the
safety
risks
posed
by
nuclear
power
plants
in
response
the
president
established
the
kemeny
commission
to
review
the
accident
and
make
recommendations
virtually
all
of
the
commissions
substantive
recommendations
were
adopted
by
the
administration
and
are
now
being
implemented
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
the
congress
adopted
the
presidents
proposed
plan
for
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
and
the
nuclear
safety
oversight
committee
was
established
to
ensure
that
the
administrations
decisions
were
implemented
nuclear
safety
will
remain
a
vital
concern
in
the
years
ahead
we
must
continue
to
press
ahead
for
the
safe
secure
disposal
of
radioactive
wastes
and
prevention
of
nuclear
proliferation
while
significant
growth
in
foreign
demand
for
us
steam

is
foreseen
congestion
must
be
removed
at
major
us
coal
exporting
ports
such
as
hampton
roads
virginia
and
baltimore
maryland
my
administration
has
worked
through
the
interagency
coal
task
force
study
to
promote
cooperation
and
coordination
of
resources
between
shippers
railroads
vessel
broker
operators
and
port
operators
and
to
determine
the
most
appropriate
federal
role
in
expanding
and
modernizing
coal
export
facilities
including
dredging
deeper
channels
at
selected
ports
as
a
result
of
the
task
forces
efforts
administrative
steps
have
been
taken
by
the
corps
of
engineers
to
reduce
significantly
the
amount
of
time
required
for
planning
and
economic
review
of
port
dredging
proposals
the
administration
has
also
recommended
that
the
congress
enact
legislation
to
give
the
president
generic
authority
to
recommend
appropriations
for
channel
dredging
activities
private
industry
will
of
course
play
the
major
role
in
developing
the
united
states
coal
export
facilities
but
the
government
must
continue
to
work
to
facilitate
transportation
to
foreign
markets
iii
enhancing
basic
human
and
social
needs
for
too
long
prior
to
my
administration
many
of
our
nations
basic
human
and
social
needs
were
being
ignored
or
handled
insensitively
by
the
federal
government
over
the
last
four
years
we
have
significantly
increased
funding
for
many
of
the
vital
programs
in
these
areas
developed
new
programs
where
needs
were
unaddressed
targeted
federal
support
to
those
individuals
and
areas
most
in
need
of
our
assistance
and
removed
barriers
that
have
unnecessarily
kept
many
disadvantaged
citizens
from
obtaining
aid
for
their
most
basic
needs
our
record
has
produced
clear
progress
in
the
effort
to
solve
some
of
the
countrys
fundamental
human
and
social
problems
my
administration
and
the
congress
working
together
have
demonstrated
that
government
must
and
can
meet
our
citizens
basic
human
and
social
needs
in
a
responsible
and
compassionate
way
but
there
is
an
unfinished
agenda
still
before
the
congress
if
we
are
to
meet
our
obligations
to
help
all
americans
realize
the
dreams
of
sound
health
care
decent
housing
effective
social

i
urge
their
passage
health
national
health
plan
during
my
administration
i
proposed
to
congress
a
national
health
plan
which
will
enable
the
country
to
reach
the
goal
of
comprehensive
universal
health
care
coverage
the
legislation
i
submitted
lays
the
foundation
for
this
comprehensive
plan
and
addresses
the
most
serious
problems
of
health
financing
and
delivery
it
is
realistic
and
enactable
it
does
not
overpromise
or
overspend
and
as
a
result
can
be
the
solution
to
the
thirty
years
of
congressional
battles
on
national
health
insurance
my
plan
includes
the
following
key
features
nearly
million
additional
poor
would
receive
fullysubsidized
comprehensive
coverage
prenatal
and
delivery
services
are
provided
for
all
pregnant
women
and
coverage
is
provided
for
all
acute
care
for
infants
in
their
first
year
of
life
the
elderly
and
disabled
would
have
a
limit
of
placed
on
annual
outofpocket
medical
expenses
and
would
no
longer
face
limits
on
hospital
coverage
all
fulltime
employees
and
their
families
would
receive
insurance
against
at
least
major
medical
expenses
under
mandated
employer
coverage
medicare
and
medicaid
would
be
combined
and
expanded
into
an
umbrella
federal
program
healthcare
for
increased
program
efficiency
accountability
and
uniformity
and
strong
cost
controls
and
health
system
reforms
would
be
implemented
including
greater
incentives
for
health
maintenance
organizations
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
compare
my
plan
with
the
alternativesprograms
which
either
do
too
little
to
improve
the
health
care
needs
of
americans
most
in
need
or
programs
which
would
impose
substantial
financial
burdens
on
the
american
taxpayers
i
hope
the
congress
will
see
the
need
for
and
the
benefits
of
my
plan
and
work
toward
prompt
enactment
we
cannot
afford
further
delay
in
this
vital
area
health
care
cost
control
inflation
in
health
care
costs
remains
unacceptably
high
throughout
my
administration
legislation
to
reduce
health
care
cost
inflation
was
one
of
my
highest
priorities
but
was
not
passed
by
the
congress
therefore
my
fy
budget
proposes
sharing
the
responsibility
for
health
care
cost
control
with
the
private
sector
through
voluntary
hospital
cost
guidelines
and
intensified
monitoring
in
the
longer
term
the
health
care
reimbursement
system
must
be
reformed
we
must
move
away
from
inflationary
costbased
reimbursement
and
feeforservice
and
toward
a
system
of
prospective
reimbursement
under
which
health
care
providers
would
operate
within
predetermined
budgets
this
reimbursement
reform
is
essential
to
ultimately
control
inflation
in
health
care
costs
and
will
be
a
significant
challenge
to
the
new
congress
health
promotion
and
disease
prevention
during
my
administration
the
surgeon
general
released
healthy
people
a
landmark
report
on
health
promotion
and
disease
prevention
the
report
signals
the
growing
consensus
that
the
nations
health
strategy
must
be
refocused
in
the
s
to
emphasize
the
prevention
of
disease
specifically
the
report
lays
out
measurable
and
achieveable
goals
in
the
reduction
of
mortality
which
can
be
reached
by
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
endorse
the
principles
of
healthy
people
and
to
adopt
the
recommendations
to
achieve
its
goals
this
will
necessitate
adoption
of
a
broader
concept
of
health
care
to
include
such
areas
as
environmental
health
workplace
health
and
safety
commercial
product
safety
traffic
safety
and
health
education
promotion
and
information
maternal
and
child
health
ensuring
a
healthy
start
in
life
for
children
remains
not
only
a
high
priority
of
my
administration
but
also
one
of
the
most
cost
effective
forms
of
health
care
when
i
took
office
immunization
levels
for
preventable
childhood
diseases
had
fallen
to
as
a
result
of
a
concerted
nationwide
effort
during
my
administration
i
am
pleased
to
report
that
now
at
least
of
children
under
and
virtually
all
schoolage
children
are
immunized
in
addition
reported
cases
of
measles
and
mumps
are
at
their
lowest
levels
ever
under
the
national
health
plan
i
have
proposed
there
would
be
no
costsharing
for
prenatal
and
delivery
services
for
all
pregnant
women
and
for
acute
care
provided
to
infants
in
their
first
year
of
life
these
preventive
services
have
extremely
high
returns
in
terms
of
improved
newborn
and
longterm
child
health
under
the
child
health
assurance
program
chap
legislation
which
i
submitted
to
the
congress
and
which
passed
the
house
an
additional
two
million
lowincome
children
under
would
become
eligible
for
medicaid
benefits
which
would
include
special
health
assessments
chap
would
also
improve
the
continuity
of
care
for
the
nearly
million
children
now
eligible
for
medicaid
an
additional
lowincome
pregnant
women
would
become
eligible
for
prenatal
care
under
the
proposal
i
strongly
urge
the
new
congress
to
enact
chap
and
thereby
provide
millions
of
needy
children
with
essential
health
services
the
legislation
has
had
strong
bipartisan
support
which
should
continue
as
the
details
of
the
bill
are
completed
i
also
urge
the
new
congress
to
provide
strong
support
for
two
highly
successful
ongoing
programs
the
special
supplemental
food
program
for
women
infants
and
children
wic
and
family
planning
the
food
supplements
under
wic
have
been
shown
to
effectively
prevent
ill
health
and
thereby
reduce
later
medical
costs
the
family
planning
program
has
been
effective
at
reducing
unwanted
pregnancies
among
lowincome
women
and
adolescents
expansion
of
services
to
the
poor

and
underserved
during
my
administration
health
services
to
the

have
been
dramatically
increased
the
number
of
national

corps
nhsc
assignees
providing

in
medically
underserved
communities
has
grown
from
in
to
nearly
in
the
population

by
the
nhsc
has
more
than
tripled
since
the
number
of
community
health
centers
providing
services
in
high
priority
underserved
areas
has
doubled
during
my
administration
and
will
serve
an
estimated
six
million
people
in
i
strongly
urge
the
new
congress
to
support
these
highly
successful
programs
mental
health
one
of
the
most
significant
health
achievements
during
my
administration
was
the
recent
passage
of
the
mental
health
systems
act
which
grew
out
of
recommendations
of
my
commission
on
mental
health
i
join
many
others
in
my
gratitude
to
the
first
lady
for
her
tireless
and
effective
contribution
to
the
passage
of
this
important
legislation
the
act
is
designed
to
inaugurate
a
new
era
of
federal
and
state
partnership
in
the
planning
and
provision
of
mental
health
services
in
addition
the
act
specifically
provides
for
prevention
and
support
services
to
the
chronically
mentally
ill
to
prevent
unnecessary
institutionalization
and
for
the
development
of
communitybased
mental
health
services
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
provide
adequate
support
for
the
full
and
timely
implementation
of
this
act
health
protection
with
my
active
support
the
congress
recently
passed
medigap
legislation
which
provides
for
voluntary
certification
of
health
insurance
policies
supplemental
to
medicare
to
curb
widespread
abuses
in
this
area
in
the
area
of
toxic
agent
control
legislation
which
i
submitted
to
the
congress
recently
passed
this
will
provide
for
a
superfund
to
cover
hazardous
waste
cleanup
costs
in
the
area
of
accidental
injury
control
we
have
established
automobile
safety
standards
and
increased
enforcement
activities
with
respect
to
the
mph
speed
limit
by
the
end
of
the
decade
these
actions
are
expected
to
save
over
lives
and
serious
injuries
each
year
i
urge
the
new
congress
to
continue
strong
support
for
all
these
activities
food
and
nutrition
building
on
the
comprehensive
reform
of
the
food
stamp
program
that
i
proposed
and
congress
passed
in
my
administration
and
the
congress
worked
together
in
and
to
enact
several
other
important
changes
in
the
program
these
changes
will
further
simplify
administration
and
reduce
fraud
and
error
will
make
the
program
more
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
elderly
and
disabled
and
will
increase
the
cap
on
allowable
program
expenditures
the
food
stamp
act
will
expire
at
the
end
of
fiscal
it
is
essential
that
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
continue
this
program
to
ensure
complete
eradication
of
the
debilitating
malnutrition
witnessed
and
documented
among
thousands
of
children
in
the
s
drug
abuse
prevention
at
the
beginning
of
my
administration
there
were
over
a
half
million
heroin
addicts
in
the
united
states
our
continued
emphasis
on
reducing
the
supply
of
heroin
as
well
as
providing
treatment
and
rehabilitation
to
its
victims
has
reduced
the
heroin
addict
population
reduced
the
number
of
heroin
overdose
deaths
by
and
reduced
the
number
of
heroin
related
injuries
by
we
have
also
seen
and
encouraged
a
national
movement
of
parents
and
citizens
committed
to
reversing
the
very
serious
and
disturbing
trends
of
adolescent
drug
abuse
drug
abuse
in
many
forms
will
continue
to
detract
however
from
the
quality
of
life
of
many
americans
to
prevent
that
i
see
four
great
challenges
in
the
years
ahead
first
we
must
deal
aggressively
with
the
supplies
of
illegal
drugs
at
their
source
through
joint
crop
destruction
programs
with
foreign
nations
and
increased
law
enforcement
and
border
interdiction
second
we
must
look
to
citizens
and
parents
across
the
country
to
help
educate
the
increasing
numbers
of
american
youth
who
are
experimenting
with
drugs
to
the
dangers
of
drug
abuse
education
is
a
key
factor
in
reducing
drug
abuse
third
we
must
focus
our
efforts
on
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
in
the
workplace
for
not
only
does
this
abuse
contribute
to
low
productivity
but
it
also
destroys
the
satisfaction
and
sense
of
purpose
all
americans
can
gain
from
the
work
experience
fourth
we
need
a
change
in
attitude
from
an
attitude
which
condones
the
casual
use
of
drugs
to
one
that
recognizes
the
appropriate
use
of
drugs
for
medical
purposes
and
condemns
the
inappropriate
and
harmful
abuse
of
drugs
i
hope
the
congress
and
the
new
administration
will
take
action
to
meet
each
of
these
challenges
education
the
american
people
have
always
recognized
that
education
is
one
of
the
soundest
investments
they
can
make
the
dividends
are
reflected
in
every
dimension
of
our
national
lifefrom
the
strength
of
our
economy
and
national
security
to
the
vitality
of
our
music
art
and
literature
among
the
accomplishments
that
have
given
me
the
most
satisfaction
over
the
last
four
years
are
the
contributions
that
my
administration
has
been
able
to
make
to
the
wellbeing
of
students
and
educators
throughout
the
country
this
administration
has
collaborated
successfully
with
the
congress
on
landmark
education
legislation
working
with
the
congressional
leadership
my
administration
spotlighted
the
importance
of
education
by
creating
a
new
department
of
education
the
department
has
given
education
a
stronger
voice
at
the
federal
level
while
at
the
same
time
reserving
the
actual
control
and
operation
of
education
to
states
localities
and
private
institutions
the
department
has
successfully
combined
nearly
federal
education
programs
into
a
cohesive
streamlined
organization
that
is
more
responsive
to
the
needs
of
educators
and
students
the
department
has
made
strides
to
cut
red
tape
and
paperwork
and
thereby
to
make
the
flow
of
federal
dollars
to
school
districts
and
institutions
of
higher
education
more
efficient
it
is
crucial
that
the
department
be
kept
intact
and
strengthened
our
collaboration
with
the
congress
has
resulted
in
numerous
other
important
legislative
accomplishments
for
education
a
little
over
two
years
ago
i
signed
into
law
on
the
same
day
two
major
billsone
benefiting
elementary
and
secondary
education
and
the
other
postsecondary
education
the
education
amendments
of
embodied
nearly
all
of
my
administrations
proposals
for
improvements
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
including
important
new
programs
to
improve
students
achievement
in
the
basic
skills
and
to
aid
school
districts
with
exceptionally
high
concentrations
of
children
from
lowincome
families
the
middle
income
student
assistance
act
legislation
jointly
sponsored
by
this
administration
and
the
congressional
leadership
expanded
eligibility
for
needbased
basic
educational
opportunity
grants
to
approximately
onethird
of
the
students
enrolled
in
postsecondary
education
and
made
many
more
students
eligible
for
the
first
time
for
other
types
of
grants
workstudy
and
loans
just
three
and
a
half
months
ago
my
administration
and
the
congress
successfully
concluded
over
two
years
of
work
on
a
major
reauthorization
bill
that
further
expands
benefits
to
postsecondary
education
reflected
in
the
education
amendments
of
are
major
administration
recommendations
for
improvements
in
the
higher
education
actincluding
proposals
for
better
loan
access
for
students
a
new
parent
loan
program
simplified
application
procedures
for
student
financial
aid
a
strengthened
federal
commitment
to
developing
colleges
particularly
the
historically
black
institutions
a
new
authorization
for
equipment
and
facilities
modernization
funding
for
the
nations
major
research
universities
and
revitalized
international
education
programs
supplementing
these
legislative
accomplishments
have
been
important
administrative
actions
aimed
at
reducing
paperwork
and
simplifying
regulations
associated
with
federal
education
programs
we
also
launched
major
initiatives
to
reduce
the
backlog
of
defaulted
student
loans
and
otherwise
to
curb
fraud
abuse
and
waste
in
education
programs
to
insure
that
the
education
enterprise
is
ready
to
meet
the
scientific
and
technological
changes
of
the
future
we
undertook
a
major
study
of
the
status
of
science
and
engineering
education
throughout
the
nation
i
hope
that
the
findings
from
this
report
will
serve
as
a
springboard
for
needed
reforms
at
all
levels
of
education
i
am
proud
that
this
administration
has
been
able
to
provide
the
financial
means
to
realize
many
of
our
legislative
and
administrative
goals
compared
to
the
previous
administrations
last
budget
i
have
requested
the
largest
overall
increase
in
federal
funding
for
education
in
our
nations
history
my
budget
requests
have
been
particularly
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
special
populations
like
minorities
women
the
educationally
and
economically
disadvantaged
the
handicapped
and
students
with
limited
englishspeaking
ability
at
the
same
time
i
have
requested
significant
increases
for
many
programs
designed
to
enhance
the
quality
of
american
education
including
programs
relating
to
important
areas
as
diverse
as
international
education
research
libraries
museums
and
teacher
centers
last
year
i
proposed
to
the
congress
a
major
legislative
initiative
that
would
direct
billion
into
education
and
job
training
programs
designed
to
alleviate
youth
unemployment
through
improved
linkages
between
the
schools
and
the
work
place
this
legislation
generated
bipartisan
support
but
unfortunately
action
on
it
was
not
completed
in
the
final
rushed
days
of
the
th
congress
i
urge
the
new
congressas
it
undertakes
broad
efforts
to
strengthen
the
economy
as
well
as
more
specific
tasks
like
reauthorizing
the
vocational
education
actto
make
the
needs
of
our
nations
unemployed
youth
a
top
priority
for
action
only
by
combining
a
basic
skills
education
program
together
with
work
training
and
employment
incentives
can
we
make
substantial
progress
in
eliminating
one
of
the
most
severe
social
problems
in
our
nationyouth
unemployment
particularly
among
minorities
i
am
proud
of
th
e
progress
already
made
through
passage
of
the
youth
employment
and
demonstration
project
act
of
and
the
substantial
increase
in
our
investment
in
youth
employment
programs
the
new
legislation
would
cap
these
efforts
income
security
social
security
one
of
the
highest
priorities
of
my
administration
has
been
to
continue
the
tradition
of
effectiveness
and
efficiency
widely
associated
with
the
social
security
program
and
to
assure
present
and
future
beneficiaries
that
they
will
receive
their
benefits
as
expected
the
earned
benefits
that
are
paid
monthly
to
retired
and
disabled
american
workers
and
their
families
provide
a
significant
measure
of
economic
protection
to
millions
of
people
who
might
otherwise
face
retirement
or
possible
disability
with
fear
i
have
enacted
changes
to
improve
the
benefits
of
many
social
security
beneficiaries
during
my
years
as
president
the
last
four
years
have
presented
a
special
set
of
concerns
over
the
financial
stability
of
the
social
security
system
shortly
after
taking
office
i
proposed
and
congress
enacted
legislation
to
protect
the
stability
of
the
old
age
and
survivors
trust
fund
and
prevent
the
imminent
exhaustion
of
the
disability
insurance
trust
fund
and
to
correct
a
flaw
in
the
benefit
formula
that
was
threatening
the
long
run
health
of
the
entire
social
security
system
the
actions
taken
by
the
congress
at
my
request
helped
stabilize
the
system
that
legislation
was
later
complemented
by
the
disability
insurance
amendments
of
which
further
bolstered
the
disability
insurance
program
and
reduced
certain
inequities
among
beneficiaries
my
commitment
to
the
essential
retirement
and
disability
protection
provided
to
million
people
each
month
has
been
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
without
interruption
those
beneficiaries
have
continued
to
receive
their
social
security
benefits
including
annual
cost
of
living
increases
changing
and
unpredictable
economic
circumstances
require
that
we
continue
to
monitor
the
financial
stability
of
the
social
security
system
to
correct
anticipated
shortterm
strains
on
the
system
i
proposed
last
year
that
the
three
funds
be
allowed
to
borrow
from
one
another
and
i
urge
the
congress
again
this
year
to
adopt
such
interfund
borrowing
to
further
strengthen
the
social
security
system
and
provide
a
greater
degree
of
assurance
to
beneficiaries
given
projected
future
economic
uncertainties
additional
action
should
be
taken
among
the
additional
financing
options
available
are
borrowing
from
the
general
fund
financing
half
of
the
hospital
insurance
fund
with
general
revenues
and
increasing
the
payroll
tax
rate
the
latter
option
is
particularly
unpalatable
given
the
significant
increase
in
the
tax
rate
already
mandated
in
law
this
administration
continues
to
oppose
cuts
in
basic
social
security
benefits
and
taxing
social
security
benefits
the
administration
continues
to
support
annual
indexing
of
social
security
benefits
welfare
reform
in
i
proposed
a
welfare
reform
package
which
offers
solutions
to
some
of
the
most
urgent
problems
in
our
welfare
system
this
proposal
is
embodied
in
two
bills
the
work
and
training
opportunities
act
and
the
social
welfare
reform
amendments
act
the
house
passed
the
second
of
these
two
proposals
within
the
framework
of
our
present
welfare
system
my
reform
proposals
offer
achievable
means
to
increase
selfsufficiency
through
work
rather
than
welfare
more
adequate
assistance
to
people
unable
to
work
the
removal
of
inequities
in
coverage
under
current
programs
and
fiscal
relief
needed
by
states
and
localities
our
current
welfare
system
is
long
overdue
for
serious
reform
the
system
is
wasteful
and
not
fully
effective
the
legislation
i
have
proposed
will
help
eliminate
inequities
by
establishing
a
national
minimum
benefit
and
by
directly
relating
benefit
levels
to
the
poverty
threshold
it
will
reduce
program
complexity
which
leads
to
inefficiency
and
waste
by
simplifying
and
coordinating
administration
among
different
programs
i
urge
the
congress
to
take
action
in
this
area
along
the
lines
i
have
recommended
child
welfare
my
administration
has
worked
closely
with
the
congress
on
legislation
which
is
designed
to
improve
greatly
the
child
welfare
services
and
foster
care
programs
and
to
create
a
federal
system
of
adoption
assistance
these
improvements
will
be
achieved
with
the
recent
enactment
of
hr
the
adoption
assistance
and
child
welfare
act
of
the
wellbeing
of
children
in
need
of
homes
and
their
permanent
placement
have
been
a
primary
concern
of
my
administration
this
legislation
will
ensure
that
children
are
not
lost
in
the
foster
care
system
but
instead
will
be
returned
to
their
families
where
possible
or
placed
in
permanent
adoptive
homes
lowincome
energy
assistance
in
i
proposed
a
program
to
provide
an
annual
total
of
billion
to
lowincome
households
which
are
hardest
hit
by
rising
energy
bills
with
the
cooperation
of
congress
we
were
able
to
move
quickly
to
provide
assistance
to
eligible
households
in
time
to
meet
their
winter
heating
bills
in
response
to
the
extreme
heat
conditions
affecting
many
parts
of
the
country
during
i
directed
the
community
services
administration
to
make
available
over
million
to
assist
lowincome
individuals
especially
the
elderly
facing
life
threatening
circumstances
due
to
extreme
heat
congress
amended
and
reauthorized
the
lowincome
energy
assistance
program
for
fiscal
year
and
provided
billion
to
meet
anticipated
increasing
need
the
need
for
a
program
to
help
lowincome
households
with
rising
energy
expenses
will
not
abate
in
the
near
future
the
lowincome
energy
assistance
program
should
be
reauthorized
to
meet
those
needs
housing
for
the
past
months
high
interest
rates
have
had
a
severe
impact
on
the
nations
housing
market
yet
the
current
pressures
and
uncertainties
should
not
obscure
the
achievements
of
the
past
four
years
working
with
the
congress
the
regulatory
agencies
and
the
financial
community
my
administration
has
brought
about
an
expanded
and
steadier
flow
of
funds
into
home
mortgages
deregulation
of
the
interest
rates
payable
by
depository
institutions
the
evolution
of
variable
and
renegotiated
rate
mortgages
development
of
high
yielding
savings
certificates
and
expansion
of
the
secondary
mortgage
market
have
all
increased
housings
ability
to
attract
capital
and
have
assured
that
mortgage
money
would
not
be
cut
off
when
interest
rates
rose
these
actions
will
diminish
the
cyclicality
of
the
housing
industry
further
we
have
secured
legislation
updating
the
federal
governments
emergency
authority
to
provide
support
for
the
housing
industry
through
the
brookecranston
program
and
creating
a
new
section
housing
stimulus
program
these
tools
will
enable
the
federal
government
to
deal
quickly
and
effectively
with
serious
distress
in
this
critical
industry
we
have
also
worked
to
expand
homeownership
opportunities
for
americans
by
using
innovative
financing
mechanisms
such
as
the
graduated
payment
mortgage
we
have
increased
the
access
of
middle
income
families
to
housing
credit
by
revitalizing
the
section
program
we
have
enabled
nearly
moderate
income
households
to
purchase
new
homes
by
reducing
paperwork
and
regulation
in
federal
programs
and
by
working
with
state
and
local
governments
to
ease
the
regulatory
burden
we
have
helped
to
hold
down
housing
costs
and
produce
affordable
housing
as
a
result
of
these
governmentwide
efforts
million
more
american
families
bought
homes
in
the
past
four
years
than
in
any
equivalent
period
in
history
and
more
than
million
homes
have
begun
construction
during
my
administration
million
more
than
in
the
previous
four
years
we
have
devoted
particular
effort
to
meeting
the
housing
needs
of
low
and
moderate
income
families
in
the
past
four
years
more
than
million
subsidized
units
have
been
made
available
for
occupancy
by
lower
income
americans
and
more
than
assisted
units
have
gone
into
construction
in
addition
we
have
undertaken
a
series
of
measures
to
revitalize
and
preserve
the
nations
million
units
of
public
and
assisted
housing
for
fiscal
year
i
am
proposing
to
continue
our
commitment
to
lower
income
housing
i
am
requesting
funds
to
support
units
of
section
and
public
housing
maintaining
these
programs
at
the
level
provided
by
congress
in
fiscal
while
we
have
made
progress
in
the
past
four
years
in
the
future
there
are
reasons
for
concern
home
price
inflation
and
high
interest
rates
threaten
to
put
homeownership
out
of
reach
for
firsttime
homebuyers
lower
income
households
the
elderly
and
those
dependent
upon
rental
housing
face
rising
rents
low
levels
of
rental
housing
construction
by
historic
standards
and
the
threat
of
displacement
due
to
conversion
to
condominiums
and
other
factors
housing
will
face
strong
competition
for
investment
capital
from
the
industrial
sector
generally
and
the
energy
industries
in
particular
to
address
these
issues
i
appointed
a
presidential
task
force
and
advisory
group
last
october
while
this
effort
will
not
proceed
due
to
the
election
result
i
hope
the
incoming
administration
will
proceed
with
a
similar
venture
the
most
important
action
government
can
take
to
meet
americas
housing
needs
is
to
restore
stability
to
the
economy
and
bring
down
the
rate
of
inflation
inflation
has
driven
up
home
prices
operating
costs
and
interest
rates
market
uncertainty
about
inflation
has
contributed
to
the
instability
in
interest
rates
which
has
been
an
added
burden
to
homebuilders
and
homebuyers
alike
by
making
a
longterm
commitment
to
provide
a
framework
for
greater
investment
sustained
economic
growth
and
price
stability
my
administration
has
begun
the
work
of
creating
a
healthy
environment
for
housing
transportation
with
the
passage
of
the
airline
deregulation
act
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
and
the
harley
o
staggers
rail
act
of
my
administration
working
with
the
congress
has
initiated
a
new
era
of
reduced
regulation
of
transportation
industries
deregulation
will
lead
to
increased
productivity
and
operating
efficiencies
in
the
industries
involved
an
d
stimulate
price
and
service
competition
to
the
benefit
of
consumers
generally
i
urge
the
new
administration
to
continue
our
efforts
on
behalf
of
deregulation
legislation
for
the
intercity
passenger
bus
industry
as
well
in
the
coming
decade
the
most
significant
challenge
facing
the
nation
in
transportation
services
will
be
to
improve
a
deteriorating
physical
infrastructure
of
roadways
railroads
waterways
and
mass
transit
systems
in
order
to
conserve
costly
energy
supplies
while
promoting
effective
transportation
services
highways
our
vast
network
of
highways
which
account
for
percent
of
travel
and
percent
by
value
of
freight
traffic
goods
movement
is
deteriorating
if
current
trends
continue
a
major
proportion
of
the
interstate
pavement
will
have
deteriorated
by
the
end
of
the
s
arresting
the
deterioration
of
the
nations
system
of
highways
is
a
high
priority
objective
for
the
s
we
must
reorient
the
federal
mission
from
major
new
construction
projects
to
the
stewardship
of
the
existing
interstate
highway
system
interstate
gaps
should
be
judged
on
the
connections
they
make
and
on
their
compatibility
with
community
needs
during
this
decade
highway
investments
will
be
needed
to
increase
productivity
particularly
in
the
elimination
of
bottlenecks
provide
more
efficient
connections
to
ports
and
seek
lowcost
solutions
to
traffic
demand
my
administration
has
therefore
recommended
redefining
completion
of
the
interstate
system
consolidating
over
categorical
assistance
programs
into
nine
and
initiating
a
major
repair
and
rehabilitation
program
for
segments
of
the
interstate
system
this
effort
should
help
maintain
the
condition
and
performance
of
the
nations
highways
particularly
the
interstate
and
primary
system
provide
a
realistic
means
to
complete
the
interstate
system
by
ensure
better
program
delivery
through
consolidation
and
assist
urban
revitalization
in
addition
the
congress
must
address
the
urgent
funding
problems
of
the
highway
trust
fund
and
the
need
to
generate
greater
revenues
mass
transit
in
the
past
decade
the
nations
public
transit
systems
ridership
increased
at
an
annual
average
of
each
year
in
the
s
in
continued
increases
in
the
cost
of
fuel
are
expected
to
make
transit
a
growing
part
of
the
nations
transportation
system
as
a
result
my
administration
projected
a
ten
year
billion
program
to
increase
mass
transit
capacity
by
percent
and
promote
more
energy
efficient
vehicle
uses
in
the
next
decade
the
first
part
of
this
proposal
was
the
five
year
billion
urban
mass
transportation
administration
reauthorization
legislation
i
sent
to
the
congress
in
march
i
urge
the
th
congress
to
quickly
enact
this
or
similar
legislation
in
my
administration
was
also
the
first
to
have
proposed
and
signed
into
law
a
nonurban
formula
grant
program
to
assist
rural
areas
and
small
communities
with
public
transportation
programs
to
end
their
dependence
on
the
automobile
promote
energy
conservation
and
efficiency
and
provide
transportation
services
to
impoverished
rural
communities
a
principal
need
of
the
s
will
be
maintaining
mobility
for
all
segments
of
the
population
in
the
face
of
severely
increasing
transportation
costs
and
uncertainty
of
fuel
supplies
we
must
improve
the
flexibility
of
our
transportation
system
and
offer
greater
choice
and
diversity
in
transportation
services
while
the
private
automobile
will
continue
to
be
the
principal
means
of
transportation
for
many
americans
public
transportation
can
become
an
increasingly
attractive
alternative
we
therefore
want
to
explore
a
variety
of
paratransit
modes
various
types
of
buses
modern
rapid
transit
regional
rail
systems
and
light
rail
systems
highway

must
be

transportation

in
the

must
pay
increasing

to
the

of
the

by
the
number
of

have
grown
from

the

as
well
as

including
the
elderlyis
expected
to
increase
from

making
up

we
must
not
retreat
from
a
policy
that
affords
a
significant
and
growing
portion
of
our
population
accessible
public
transportation
while
recognizing
that
the
handicapped
are
a
diverse
group
and
will
need
flexible
doortodoor
service
where
regular
public
transportation
will
not
do
the
job
railroads
in
addition
the
federal
government
must
reassess
the
appropriate
federal
role
of
support
for
passenger
and
freight
rail
services
such
as
amtrak
and
conrail
our
goal
through
federal
assistance
should
be
to
maintain
and
enhance
adequate
rail
service
where
it
is
not
otherwise
available
to
needy
communities
but
federal
subsidies
must
be
closely
scrutinized
to
be
sure
they
are
a
stimulus
to
and
not
a
replacement
for
private
investment
and
initiative
federal

cannot
mean
permanent
subsidies
for
unprofitable
operations
waterways
and
rural
transportation
there
is
a
growing
need
in
rural
and
small
communities
for
improved
transportation
services
rail
freight
service
to
many
communities
has
declined
as
railroads
abandon
unproductive
branch
lines
at
the
same
time
rural
roads
are
often
inadequate
to
handle
large
heavilyloaded
trucks
the
increased
demand
for
harvest
to
harbor
service
has
also
placed
an
increased
burden
on
rural
transportation
systems
while
bottlenecks
along
the
mississippi
river
delay
grain
shipments
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
we
have
made
some
progress
to
further
develop
the
nations
waterways
my
administration
began
construction
of
a
new
foot
lock
at
the
site
of
lock
and
dam
on
the
mississippi
river
when
opened
in
the

have
a
capacity
of
million
tons
per

an
percent
increase
over
the
present

the
us
army

has
also
undertaken
studies
to
assess
the
feasibility
of
expanding
the
bonneville

the
upper
mississippi

master
plan
to
determine
the
feasibility
of
constructing
a
second

at

these
efforts
will
help
alleviate
delays
in
transporting
corn

maritime
policy
during
my
administration
i
have
sought
to
ensure
that
the
us
maritime
industry
will
not
have
to
function
at
an
unfair
competitive
disadvantage
in
the
international
market
as
i
indicated
in
my
maritime
policy
statement
to
the
congress
in
july
the
american
merchant
marine
is
vital
to
our
nations
welfare
and
federal
actions
should
promote
rather
than
harm
it
in
pursuit
of
this
objective
i
signed
into
law
the
controlled
carrier
act
of
authorizing
the
federal
maritime
commission
to
regulate
certain
rate
cutting
practices
of
some
statecontrolled
carriers
and
recently
signed
a
bilateral
maritime
agreement
with
the
peoples
republic
of
china
that
will
expand
the
access
of
american
ships
to
specified
chinese
ports
and
set
aside
for
americanflag
ships
a
substantial
share
at
least
onethird
of
the
cargo
between
our
countries
this
agreement
should
officially
foster
expanded
us
and
chinese
shipping
services
linking
the
two
countries
and
will
provide
further
momentum
to
the
growth
of
sinoamerican
trade
there
is
also
a
need
to
modernize
and
expand
the
dry
bulk
segment
of
our
fleet
our
heavy
dependence
on
foreign
carriage
of
usbulk
cargoes
deprives
the
us
economy
of
seafaring
and
shipbuilding
jobs
adds
to
the
balanceofpayments
deficit
deprives
the
government
of
substantial
tax
revenues
and
leaves
the
united
states
dependent
on
foreignflag
shipping
for
a
continued
supply
of
raw
materials
to
support
the
civil
economy
and
war
production
in
time
of
war
i
therefore
sent
to
the
congress
proposed
legislation
to
strengthen
this
woefully
weak
segment
of
the
usflag
fleet
by
removing
certain
disincentives
to
us
construction
of
dry
bulkers
and
their
operation
under
us
registry
enactment
of
this
proposed
legislation
would
establish
the
basis
for
accelerating
the
rebuilding
of
the
usflag
dry
bulk
fleet
toward
a
level
commensurate
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
the
worlds
leading
bulk
trading
country
during
the
past
year
the
administration
has
stated
its
support
for
legislation
that
would
provide
specific
federal
assistance
for
the
installation
of
fuelefficient
engines
in
existing
american
ships
and
would
strengthen
this
countrys
shipbuilding
mobilization
base
strengthening
the
fleet
is
important
but
we
must
also
maintain
our
shipbuilding
base
for
future
ship
construction
provisions
in
existing
laws
calling
for
substantial

special
needs
women
the
past
four
years
have
been
years
of
rapid
advancement
for
women
our
focus
has
been
twofold
to
provide
american
women
with
a
full
range
of
opportunities
and
to
make
them
a
part
of
the
mainstream
of
every
aspect
of
our
national
life
and
leadership
i
have
appointed
a
record
number
of
women
to
judgeships
and
to
top
government
posts
fully
percent
of
all
my
appointees
are
women
and
i
nominated
of
the
women
who
sit
on
the
federal
bench
today
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
women
occupy
policymaking
positions
at
the
highest
level
of
every
federal
agency
and
department
and
have
demonstrated
their
ability
to
serve
our
citizens
well
we
have
strengthened
the
rights
of
employed
women
by
consolidating
and
strengthening
enforcement
of
sex
discrimination
laws
under
the
eeoc
by
expanding
employment
rights
of
pregnant
women
through
the
pregnancy
disability
bill
and
by
increasing
federal
employment
opportunities
for
women
through
civil
service
reform
and
flexitime
and
parttime
employment
by
executive
order
i
created
the
first
national
program
to
provide
women
businessowners
with
technical
assistance
grants
loans
and
improved
access
to
federal
contracts
we
have
been
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
women
who
are
homemakers
i
established
an
office
of
families
within
hhs
and
sponsored
the
white
house
conference
on
families
we
initiated
a
program
targeting
ceta
funds
to
help
displaced
homemakers
the
social
security
system
was
amended
to
eliminate
the
widows
penalty
and
a
comprehensive
study
of
discriminatory
provisions
and
possible
changes
was
presented
to
congress
legislation
was
passed
to
give
divorced
spouses
of
foreign
service
officers
rights
to
share
in
pension
benefits
we
created
an
office
on
domestic
violence
within
hhs
to
coordinate
the
agencies
that
now
have
domestic
violence
relief
programs
and
to
distribute
information
on
the
problem
and
the
services
available
to
victims
despite
a
stringent
budget
for
fy
the
administration
consistently
supported
the
womens
educational
equity
act
and
family
planning
activities
as
well
as
other
programs
that
affect
women
such
as
food
stamps
wic
and
social
security
we
have
been
concerned
not
only
about
the
american
womans
opportunities
but
ensuring
equality
for
women
around
the
world
in
november
i
sent
to
the
senate
the
convention
on
the
elimination
of
all
forms
of
discrimination
against
women
this
united
nations
document
is
the
most
comprehensive
and
detailed
international
agreement
which
seeks
the
advancement
of
women
on
womens
issues
i
have
sought
the
counsel
of
men
and
women
in
and
out
of
government
and
from
all
regions
of
our
country
i
established
two
panels
the
presidents
advisory
committee
for
women
and
the
interdepartmental
task
force
on
womento
advise
me
on
these
issues
the
mandate
for
both
groups
expired
on
december
but
they
have
left
behind
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
status
of
women
in
our
society
today
that
review
provides
excellent
guidance
for
the
work
remaining
in
our
battle
against
sex
discrimination
even
though
we
have
made
progress
much
remains
on
the
agenda
for
women
i
remain
committed
to
the
equal
rights
amendment
and
will
continue
to
work
for
its
passage
it
is
essential
to
the
goal
of
bringing
americas
women
fully
into
the
mainstream
of
american
life
that
the
era
be
ratified
the
efforts
begun
for
women
in
employment
business
and
education
should
be
continued
and
strengthened
money
should
be
available
to
states
to
establish
programs
to
help
the
victims
of
domestic
violence
congress
should
pass
a
national
health
care
plan
and
a
welfare
reform
program
and
these
measures
should
reflect
the
needs
of
women
the
talents
of
women
should
continue
to
be
used
to
the
fullest
inside
and
outside
of
government
and
efforts
should
continue
to
see
that
they
have
the
widest
range
of
opportunities
and
options
handicapped
i
hope
that
my
administration
will
be
remembered
in
this
area
for
leading
the
way
toward
full
civil
rights
for
handicapped
americans
when
i
took
office
no
federal
agency
had
yet
issued
regulations
as
i
leave
office
this
first
step
by
every
major
agency
and
department
in
the
federal
government
is
almost
complete
but
it
is
only
a
first
step
the
years
ahead
will
require
steadfast
dedication
by
the
president
to
protect
and
promote
these
precious
rights
in
the
classroom
in
the
workplace
and
in
all
public
facilities
so
that
handicapped
individuals
may
join
the
american
mainstream
and
contribute
to
the
fullest
their
resources
and
talents
to
our
economic
and
social
life
just
as
we
supported
in
an
unprecedented
way
the
civil
rights
of
disabled
persons
in
schools
and
in
the
workplace
other
initiatives
in
health
prevention
such
as
our
immunization
and
nutrition
programs
for
young
children
and
new
intense
efforts
to
reverse
spinal
cord
injury
must
continue
so
that
the
incidence
of
disability
continues
to
decline
this
year
is
the
undeclared
international
year
of
disabled
persons
we
are
organizing
activities
to
celebrate
and
promote
this
important
commemorative
year
within
the
government
as
well
as
in
cooperation
with
private
sector
efforts
in
this
country
and
around
the
world
the
international
year
will
give
our
country
the
opportunity
to
recognize
the
talents
and
capabilities
of
our
fellow
citizens
with
disabilities
we
can
also
share
our
rehabilitation
and
treatment
skills
with
other
countries
and
learn
from
them
as
well
i
am
proud
that
the
united
states
leads
the
world
in
mainstreaming
and
treating
disabled
people
however
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
all
psychological
and
physical
barriers
to
disabled
people
are
torn
down
and
they
can
be
full
participants
in
our
american
way
of
life
we
must
pledge
our
full
commitment
to
this
goal
during
the
international
year
families
because
of
my
concern
for
american
families
my
administration
convened
last
year
the
first
white
house
conference
on
families
which
involved
seven
national
hearings
over
state
and
local
events
three
white
house
conferences
and
the
direct
participation
of
more
than
citizens
the
conference
reaffirmed
the
centrality
of
families
in
our
lives
and
nation
but
documented
problems
american
families
face
as
well
we
also
established
the
office
of
families
within
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
to
review
government
policies
and
programs
that
affect
families
i
expect
the
departments
and
agencies
within
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
as
well
as
members
of
congress
corporate
and
business
leaders
and
state
and
local
officials
across
the
country
to
study
closely
the
recommendations
of
the
white
house
conference
and
implement
them
appropriately
as
public
policy
is
developed
and
implemented
by
the
federal
government
cognizance
of
the
work
of
the
conference
should
be
taken
as
a
pragmatic
and
essential
step
the
conference
has
done
a
good
job
of
establishing
an
agenda
for
action
to
assure
that
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
are
more
sensitive
in
their
impact
on
families
i
hope
the
congress
will
review
and
seriously
consider
the
conferences
recommendations
older
americans
my
administration
has
taken
great
strides
toward
solving
the
difficult
problems
faced
by
older
americans
early
in
my
term
we
worked
successfully
with
the
congress
to
assure
adequate
revenues
for
the
social
security
trust
funds
and
last
year
the
strength
of
the
social
security
system
was
strengt
hened
by
legislation
i
proposed
to
permit
borrowing
among
the
separate
trust
funds
i
have
also
signed
into
law
legislation
prohibiting
employers
from
requiring
retirement
prior
to
age
and
removing
mandatory
retirement
for
most
federal
employees
in
addition
my
administration
worked
very
closely
with
congress
to
amend
the
older
americans
act
in
a
way
that
has
already
improved
administration
of
its
housing
social
services
food
delivery
and
employment
programs
this
year
i
will
be
submitting
to
congress
a
budget
which
again
demonstrates
my
commitment
to
programs
for
the
elderly
it
will
include
as
my
previous
budgets
have
increased
funding
for
nutrition
senior
centers
and
home
health
care
and
will
focus
added
resources
on
the
needs
of
older
americans
with
the
white
house
conference
on
aging
approaching
i
hope
the
new
administration
will
make
every
effort
to
assure
an
effective
and
useful
conference
this
conference
should
enable
older
americans
to
voice
their
concerns
and
give
us
guidance
in
our
continued
efforts
to
ensure
the
quality
of
life
so
richly
deserved
by
our
senior
citizens
refugees
we
cannot
hope
to
build
a
just
and
humane
society
at
home
if
we
ignore
the
humanitarian
claims
of
refugees
their
lives
at
stake
who
have
nowhere
else
to
turn
our
country
can
be
proud
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
around
the
world
would
risk
everything
they
haveincluding
their
own
livesto
come
to
our
country
this
administration
initiated
and
implemented
the
first
comprehensive
reform
of
our
refugee
and
immigration
policies
in
over
years
we
also
established
the
first
refugee
coordination
office
in
the
department
of
state
under
the
leadership
of
a
special
ambassador
and
coordinator
for
refugee
affairs
and
programs
the
new
legislation
and
the
coordinators
office
will
bring
common
sense
and
consolidation
to
our
nations
previously
fragmented
inconsistent
and
in
many
ways
outdated
refugee
and
immigration
policies
with
the
unexpected
arrival
of
thousands
of
cubans
and
haitians
who
sought
refuge
in
our
country
last
year
outside
of
our
regular
immigration
and
refugee
admissions
process
our
country
and
its
government
were
tested
in
being
compassionate
and
responsive
to
a
major
human
emergency
because
we
had
taken
steps
to
reorganize
our
refugee
programs
we
met
that
test
successfully
i
am
proud
that
the
american
people
responded
to
this
crisis
with
their
traditional
good
will
and
hospitality
also
we
would
never
have
been
able
to
handle
this
unprecedented
emergency
without
the
efforts
of
the
private
resettlement
agencies
who
have
always
been
there
to
help
refugees
in
crises
immigrants
to
this
country
always
contribute
more
toward
making
our
country
stronger
than
they
ever
take
from
the
system
i
am
confident
that
the
newest
arrivals
to
our
country
will
carry
on
this
tradition
while
we
must
remain
committed
to
aiding
and
assisting
those
who
come
to
our
shores
at
the
same
time
we
must
uphold
our
immigration
and
refugee
policies
and
provide
adequate
enforcement
resources
as
a
result
of
our
enforcement
policy
the
illegal
flow
from
cuba
has
been
halted
and
an
orderly
process
has
been
initiated
to
make
certain
that
our
refugee
and
immigration
laws
are
honored
this
year
the
select
commission
on
immigration
and
refugee
policy
will
complete
its
work
and
forward
its
advice
and
recommendations
i
hope
that
the
recommendations
will
be
carefully
considered
by
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
for
it
is
clear
that
we
must
take
additional
action
to
keep
our
immigration
policy
responsive
to
emergencies
and
ever
changing
times
veterans
this
country
and
its
leadership
has
a
continuing
and
unique
obligation
to
the
men
and
women
who
served
their
nation
in
the
armed
forces
and
help
maintain
or
restore
peace
in
the
world
my
commitment
to
veterans
as
evidenced
by
my
record
is
characterized
by
a
conscientious
and
consistent
emphasis
in
these
general
areas
first
we
have
worked
to
honor
the
vietnam
veteran
during
my
administration
and
under
the
leadership
of
va
administrator
max
cleland
i
was
proud
to
lead
our
country
in
an
overdue
acknowledgement
of
our
nations
gratitude
to
the
men
and
women
who
served
their
country
during
the
bitter
war
in
southeast
asia
their
homecoming
was
deferred
and
seemed
doomed
to
be
ignored
our
country
has
matured
in
the
last
four
years
and
at
long
last
we
were
able
to
separate
the
war
from
the
warrior
and
honor
these
veterans
but
with
our
acknowledgement
of
their
service
goes
an
understanding
that
some
vietnam
veterans
have
unique
needs
and
problems
my
administration
was
able
to
launch
a
long
sought
after
psychological
readjustment
and
outreach
program
unprecedented
in
its
popularity
sensitivity
and
success
this
program
must
be
continued
the
administration
has
also
grappled
with
the
difficult
questions
posed
by
some
veterans
who
served
in
southeast
asia
and
were
exposed
to
potentially
harmful
substances
including
the
herbicide
known
as
agent
orange
we
have
launched
scientific
inquiries
that
should
answer
many
veterans
questions
about
their
health
and
should
provide
the
basis
for
establishing
sound
compensation
policy
we
cannot
rest
until
their
concerns
are
dealt
with
in
a
sensitive
expeditious
and
compassionate
fashion
second
we
have
focused
the
va
health
care
system
in
the
needs
of
the
serviceconnected
disabled
veteran
we
initiated
and
are
implementing
the
first
reform
of
the
va
vocational
rehabilitation
system
since
its
inception
in
also
my
administration
was
the
first
to
seek
a
costofliving
increase
for
the
recipients
of
va
compensation
every
year
my
last
budget
also
makes
such
a
request
the
administration
also
launched
the
disabled
veterans
outreach
program
in
the
department
of
labor
which
has
successfully
placed
disabled
veterans
in
jobs
services
provided
by
the
va
health
care
system
will
be
further
targeted
to
the
special
needs
of
disabled
veterans
during
the
coming
year
third
the
va
health
care
system
the
largest
in
the
free
world
has
maintained
its
independence
and
high
quality
during
my
administration
we
have
made
the
system
more
efficient
and
have
therefore
treated
more
veterans
than
ever
before
by
concentrating
on
outpatient
care
and
through
modern
management
improvements
as
the
median
age
of
the
american
veteran
population
increases
we
must
concentrate
on
further
changes
within
the
va
system
to
keep
it
independent
and
to
serve
as
a
model
to
the
nation
and
to
the
world
as
a
center
for
research
treatment
and
rehabilitation

have
accomplished
this
goal
by
encouraging
economic
development
of
local
communities
and
by
supporting
the
general
revenue
sharing
and
other
essential
grantinaid
programs
grantsinaid
to
states
and
localities
during
my
administration
total
grantsinaid
to
state
and
local
governments
have
increased
by
more
than
percent
from
billion
in
fiscal
year
to
billion
in
fiscal
year
this
significant
increase
in
aid
has
allowed
states
and
localities
to
maintain
services
that
are
essential
to
their
citizens
without
imposing
onerous
tax
burdens
it
also
has
allowed
us
to
establish
an
unprecedented
partnership
between
the
leaders
of
the
federal
government
and
state
and
local
government
elected
officials
general
revenue
sharing
last
year
congress
enacted
legislation
that
extends
the
general
revenue
sharing
program
for
three
more
years
this
program
is
the
cornerstone
of
our
efforts
to
maintain
the
fiscal
health
of
our
nations
local
government
it
will
provide
billion
in
each
of
the
next
three
years
to
cities
counties
and
towns
this
program
is
essential
to
the
continued
ability
of
our
local
governments
to
provide
essential
police
fire
and
sanitation
services
this
legislation
renewing
grs
will
be
the
cornerstone
of
federalstatelocal
government
relations
in
the
s
this
policy
will
emphasize
the
need
for
all
levels
of
government
to
cooperate
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
most
fiscally
strained
cities
and
counties
and
also
will
emphasize
the
important
role
that
grs
can
play
in
forging
this
partnership
i
am
grateful
that
congress
moved
quickly
to
assure
that
our
nations
localities
can
begin
the
s
in
sound
fiscal
condition
countercyclical
assistance
last
year
i
proposed
that
congress
enact
a
billion
countercyclical
fiscal
assistance
program
to
protect
states
and
localities
from
unexpected
changes
in
the
national
economy
this
program
unfortunately
was
not
enacted
by
the
full
congress
i
therefore
have
not
included
funding
for
countercyclical
aid
in
my
fiscal
year
budget
nevertheless
i
urge
congress
to
enact
a
permanent
standby
countercyclical
program
so
that
states
and
cities
can
be
protected
during
the
next
economic
downturn
urban
policy
three
years
ago
i
proposed
the
nations
first
comprehensive
urban
policy
that
policy
involved
more
than
one
hundred
improvements
in
existing
federal
programs
four
new
executive
orders
and
nineteen
pieces
of
urbanoriented
legislation
with
congress
cooperation
sixteen
of
these
bills
have
now
been
signed
into
law
economic
development
one
of
the
principal
goals
of
my
domestic
policy
has
been
to
strengthen
the
private
sector
economic
base
of
our
nations
economically
troubled
urban
and
rural
areas
with
congress
cooperation
we
have
substantially
expanded
the
federal
governments
economic
development
programs
and
provided
new
tax
incentives
for
private
investment
in
urban
and
rural
communities
these
programs
have
helped
many
communities
to
attract
new
private
sector
jobs
and
investments
and
to
retain
the
jobs
and
investments
that
already
are
in
place
when
i
took
office
the
federal
government
was
spending
less
than
million
annually
on
economic
development
programs
and
only
million
of
those
funds
in
our
nations
urban
areas
since
that
time
we
have
created
the
urban
development
action
grant
udag
program
and
substantially
expanded
the
economic
development
programs
in
the
commerce
department
my
fy
b
udget
requests
more
than
billion
for
economic
development
grants
loans
and
interest
subsidies
and
almost
billion
for
loan
guarantees
approximately
percent
of
these
funds
will
be
spent
in
our
nations
urban
areas
in
addition
we
have
extended
the
percent
investment
credit
to
include
rehabilitation
of
existing
industrial
facilities
as
well
as
new
construction
i
continue
to
believe
that
the
development
of
private
sector
investment
and
jobs
is
the
key
to
revitalizing
our
nations
economically
depressed
urban
and
rural
areas
to
ensure
that
the
necessary
economic
development
goes
forward
the
congress
must
continue
to
provide
strong
support
for
the
udag
program
and
the
programs
for
the
economic
development
administration
those
programs
provide
a
foundation
for
the
economic
development
of
our
nation
in
the
s
community
development
the
partnership
among
federal
state
and
local
governments
to
revitalize
our
nations
communities
has
been
a
high
priority
of
my
administration
when
i
took
office
i
proposed
a
substantial
expansion
of
the
community
development
block
grant
cdbg
program
and
the
enactment
of
a
new
million
urban
development
action
grant
udag
program
both
of
these
programs
have
provided
essential
community
and
economic
development
assistance
to
our
nations
cities
and
counties
last
year
congress
reauthorized
both
the
cdbg
and
udag
programs
the
cdbg
program
was
reauthorized
for
three
more
years
with
annual
funding
increases
of
million
and
the
udag
program
was
extended
for
three
years
at
the
current
funding
level
of
million
annually
my
budget
requests
full
funding
for
both
of
these
programs
these
actions
should
help
our
nations
cities
and
counties
to
continue
the
progress
they
have
made
in
the
last
three
years
neighborhoods
during
my
administration
we
have
taken
numerous
positive
steps
to
achieve
a
full
partnership
of
neighborhood
organizations
and
government
at
all
levels
we
have
successfully
fought
against
red
lining
and
housing
discrimination
we
created
innovative
self
help
funding
and
technical
resource
transfer
mechanisms
we
have
created
unique
methods
of
access
for
neighborhood
organizations
to
have
a
participating
role
in
federal
and
state
government
decisionmaking
neighborhood
based
organizations
are
the
threshold
of
the
american
community
the
federal
government
will
need
to
develop
more
innovative
and
practical
ways
for
neighborhood
based
organizations
to
successfully
participate
in
the
identification
and
solution
of
local
and
neighborhood
concerns
full
partnership
will
only
be
achieved
with
the
knowing
participation
of
leaders
of
government
business
education
and
unions
neither
state
nor
federal
solutions
imposed
from
on
high
will
suffice
neighborhoods
are
the
fabric
and
soul
of
this
great
land
neighborhoods
define
the
weave
that
has
been
used
to
create
a
permanent
fabric
the
federal
government
must
take
every
opportunity
to
provide
access
and
influence
to
the
individuals
and
organizations
affected
at
the
neighborhood
level
rural
policy
since
the
beginning
of
my
administration
i
have
been
committed
to
improving
the
effectiveness
with
which
the
federal
government
deals
with
the
problems
and
needs
of
a
rapidly
changing
rural
america
the
rapid
growth
of
some
rural
areas
has
placed
a
heavy
strain
on
communities
and
their
resources
there
are
also
persistent
problems
of
poverty
and
economic
stagnation
in
other
parts
of
rural
america
some
rural
areas
continue
to
lose
population
as
they
have
for
the
past
several
decades
in
december
i
announced
the
small
community
and
rural
development
policy
it
was
the
culmination
of
several
years
work
and
was
designed
to
address
the
varying
needs
of
our
rural
population
in
my
administration
worked
with
the
congress
to
pass
the
rural
development
policy
act
of
which
when
fully
implemented
will
allow
us
to
meet
the
needs
of
rural
people
and
their
communities
more
effectively
and
more
efficiently
as
a
result
of
the
policy
and
the
accompanying
legislation
we
have
created
the
position
of
under
secretary
of
agriculture
for
small
community
and
rural
development
to
provide
overall
leadership
established
a
white
house
working
group
to
assist
in
the
implementation
of
the
policy
worked
with
more
than
governors
to
form
state
rural
development
councils
to
work
in
partnership
with
the
white
house
working
group
and
the
federal
agencies
to
better
deliver
state
and
federal
programs
to
rural
areas
directed
the
white
house
working
group
to
annually
review
existing
and
proposed
policies
programs
and
budget
levels
to
determine
their
adequacy
in
meeting
rural
needs
and
the
fulfilling
of
the
policys
objectives
and
principles
this
effort
on
the
part
of
my
administration
and
the
congress
has
resulted
in
a
landmark
policy
for
the
first
time
rural
affairs
has
received
the
prominence
it
has
always
deserved
it
is
a
policy
that
can
truly
help
alleviate
the
diverse
and
differing
problems
rural
america
will
face
in
the
s
with
the
help
and
dedication
of
a
great
many
people
around
the
country
who
are
concerned
with
rural
affairs
we
have
constructed
a
mechanism
for
dealing
effectively
with
rural
problems
there
is
now
a
great
opportunity
to
successfully
combine
federal
efforts
with
the
efforts
of
rural
community
leaders
and
residents
it
is
my
hope
this
spirit
of
cooperation
and
record
of
accomplishment
will
be
continued
in
the
coming
years
consumers
in
september
i
signed
an
executive
order
designed
to
strengthen
and
coordinate
federal
consumer
programs
and
to
establish
procedures
to
improve
and
facilitate
consumer
participation
in
government
decisionmaking
forty
federal
agencies
have
adopted
programs
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
order
these
programs
will
improve
complaint
handling
provide
better
information
to
consumers
enhance
opportunities
for
public
participation
in
government
proceedings
and
assure
that
the
consumer
point
of
view
is
considered
in
all
programs
policies
and
regulations
while
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
assuring
a
consumer
presence
in
federal
agencies
work
must
continue
to
meet
fully
the
goals
of
the
executive
order
close
monitoring
of
agency
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
order
is
necessary
continued
evaluation
to
assure
that
the
programs
are
effective
and
making
maximum
use
of
available
resources
is
also
essential
as
a
complement
to
these
initiatives
efforts
to
provide
financial
assistance
in
regulatory
proceedings
to
citizen
groups
small
businesses
and
others
whose
participation
is
limited
by
their
economic
circumstances
must
continue
to
be
pursued
it
is
essential
that
consumer
representatives
in
government
pay
particular
attention
to
the
needs
and
interests
of

ways
that

our
society
to

new
ways
should
be
found
to
help
foster
this
new

which
is
founded
on
the
principle
of

science
and
technology
science
and
technology
contribute
immeasurably
to
the
lives
of
all
americans
our
high
standard
of
living
is
largely
the
product
of
the
technology
that
surrounds
us
in
the
home
or
factory
our
good
health
is
due
in
large
part
to
our
ever
increasing
scientific
understanding
our
national
security
is
assured
by
the
application
pate
science
and
technology
will
bring
the
federal
government
has
a
special
role
to
play
in
science
and
technology
although
the
fruits
of
scientific
achievements
surround
us
it
is
often
difficult
to
predict
the
benefits
that
will
arise
from
a
given
scientific
venture
and
these
benefits
even
if
predictable
do
not
usually
lead
to
ownership
rights
accordingly
the
government
has
a
special
obligation
to
support
science
as
an
investment
in
our
future
my
administration
has
sought
to
reverse
a
decadelong
decline
in
funding
despite
the
need
for
fiscal
restraint
real
support
of
basic
research
has
grown
nearly
during
my
term
in
office
and
my
administration
has
sought
to
increase
the
support
of
longterm
research
in
the
variety
of
mission
agencies
in
this
way
we
can
harness
the
american
genius
for
innovation
to
meet
the
economic
energy
health
and
security
challenges
that
confront
our
nation
international
relations
and
national
security
science
and
technology
are
becoming
increasingly
important
elements
of
our
national
security
and
foreign
policies
this
is
especially
so
in
the
current
age
of
sophisticated
defense
systems
and
of
growing
dependence
among
all
countries
on
modern
technology
for
all
aspects
of
their
economic
strength
for
these
reasons
scientific
and
technological
considerations
have
been
integral
elements
of
the
administrations
decisionmaking
on
such
national
security
and
foreign
policy
issues
as
the
modernization
of
our
strategic
weaponry
arms

technology
transfer
the
growing
bilateral
relationship

and
our
relations
with
the

at
my
direction
my
science
and

adviser
has
actively
pursued
international
programs
in
support
of
these
four
themes
we
have
given
special
attention
to
scientific
and
technical
relations
with
china
to
new
forms
of
scientific
and
technical
cooperation
with
japan
to

latin

countries
and
several
states
in
black
america
and
to
the
proposed
institute
for
scientific
and
technological
cooperation
in
particular
our
cooperation
with
developing
countries
reflects
the

importance
that
each
of
them
has
placed
on
the
relationship
between
economic
growth
and
scientific
and
technological
capability
it
also
reflects
their
view
that
the
great
strength
of
the
us
in
science
and
technology
makes
close
relations
with
the
us
technical
community
an
especially
productive
means
of
enhancing
this
capability
scientific
and
technological
assistance
is
a
key
linkage
between
the
us
and
the
developing
world
a
linkage
that
has
been
underutilized
in
the
past
and
one
which
we
must
continue
to
work
to
strengthen
space
policy
the
administration
has
established
a
framework
for
a
strong
and
evolving
space
program
for
the
s
the
administrations
space
policy
reaffirmed
the
separation
of
military
space
systems
and
the
open
civil
space
program
and
at
the
same
time
provided
new
guidance
on
technology
transfer
between
the
civil
and
military
programs
the
civil
space
program
centers
on
three
basic
tenets
first
our
space
policy
will
reflect
a
balanced
strategy
of
applications
science
and
technology
development
second
activities
will
be
pursued
when
they
can
be
uniquely
or
more
efficiently
accomplished
in
space
third
a
premature
commitment
to
a
high
challenge

there
will
be
added

the
shuttle
dominates
our
technology
development
effort
and
correctly
so
it
represents
one
of
the
most
sophisticated
technological
challenges
ever
undertaken
and
as
a
result
has
encountered
technical
problems
nonetheless
the
first
manned
orbital
flight
is
now
scheduled
for
march
i
have
been
pleased
to
support
strongly
the
necessary
funds
for
the
shuttle
throughout
my
administration
space
applications
since
the
us
has
conducted
experimental
civil
remote

through
landsat
satellites
thereby
realizing
many
successful
applications
recognizing
this
fact
i
directed
the
implementation
of
an
operational
civil
land
satellite
remote
sensing
system
with
the
operational
management
responsibility
in
commerces
national
oceanic
and

administration
in
addition
because
ocean
observations
from
space
can
meet
common
civil
and
military
data
requirements
a
national
oceanic
satellite
system
has
been
proposed
as
a
major
fy
new
start
space
science
exploration
the
goals
of
this
administrations
policy
in
space
science
have
been
to
continue
a
vigorous
program
of
planetary
exploration
to
understand
the
origin
and
evolution
of
the
solar
system
utilize
the

and

to
usher
in
a
new
era
of

develop
a
better
understanding
of
the

and
its
interaction
with
the

washington

is
home
to
both
the

and
to
more
than
half
a

have
worked
to
improve
the

in
order
to
further

the

than
was
the
case
four
years
ago
yet
despite
the
close
cooperation
between
my

and
that
of

we
have
not
yet
seen
the
necessary
number
of

ratify
the
constitutional

granting
full

in

to
the
citizens
of

it
is
my
hope
that
this
inequity
will
be
rectified
the

and
the
people
who
inhabit
washington
deserve
no
less
the
arts
the
arts
are
a
precious
national
resource
federal
support
for
the
arts
has
been
enhanced
during
my
administration
by
expanding
government
funding
and
services
to
arts
institutions
individual
artists
scholars
and
teachers
through
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
we
have
broadened
its
scope
and
reach
to
a
more
diverse
population
we
have
also
reactivated
the
federal
council
on
the
arts
and
humanities
it
is
my
hope
that
during
the
coming
years
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
will
continue
support
of
institutions
promoting
development
and
understanding
of
the
arts
encourage
business
participants
in
a
comprehensive
effort
to
achieve
a
truly
mixed
economy
of
support
for
the
arts
explore
a
variety
of
mechanisms
to
nurture
the
creative
talent
of
our

appropriations
for

for
the

the
congress
has
once
again
reaffirmed
that
the
encouragement
and
support
of
national
progress
and
scholarship
in
the
humanities
while
primarily
a
matter
for
private
and
local
initiative
is
also
an
appropriate
matter
of
concern
to
the
federal
government
and
that
a
high
civilization
must
not
limit
its
efforts
to
science
and
technology
alone
but
must
give
full
value
and
support
to
the
other
great
branches
of
mans
scholarly
and
cultural
activity
in
order
to
achieve
a
better
understanding
of
the
past
a
better
analysis
of
the
present
and
a
better
view
of
the
future
i
believe
we
are
in
agreement
that
the
humanities
illuminate
the
values
underlying
important
personal
social
and
national
questions
raised
in
our
society
by
its
multiple
links
to
and
increasing
dependence
on
technology
and
by
the
diverse
heritage
of
our
many
regions
and
ethnic
groups
the
humanities
cast
light
on
the
broad
issue
of
the
role
in
a
society
of
men
and
women
of
imagination
and
energythose
individuals
who
through
their
own
example
define
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
in
so
doing
move
nations
our
governments
support
for
the
humanities
within
the
framework
laid
down
by
the
congress
is
a
recognition
of
their
essential
nourishment
of
the
life
of
the
mind
and
vital
enrichment
of
our
national
life
i
will
be
proposing
an
increase
in
funding
this
year
sufficient
to
enable
the
endowment
to
maintain
the
same
level
of
support
offered
our
citizens
in
fiscal
year
in
the
allocation
of
this
funding
special
emphasis
will
be
given
to
humanities
education
in
the
nations
schools
in
response
to
the
great
needs
that
have
arisen
in
this
area
scholarly
research
designed
to
increase
our
understanding
of
the
cultures
traditions
and
historical
forces
at
work
in
other
nations
and
in
our
own
drawing
attention
to
the
physical
disintegration
of
the
raw
material
of
our
cultural
heritagebooks
manuscripts
periodicals
and
other
documentsand
to
the
development
of
techniques
to
prevent
the
destruction
and
to
preserve
those
materials
and
the
dissemination
of
quality
programming
in
the
humanities
to
increasingly
large
american
audiences
through
the
use
of
radio
and
television
the
dominant
effort
in
the
endowments
expenditures
will
be
a
commitment
to
strengthen
and
promulgate
scholarly
excellence
and
achievement
in
work
in
the
humanities
in
our
schools
colleges
universities
libraries
museums
and
other
cultural
institutions
as
well
as
in
the
work
of
individual
scholars
or
collaborative
groups
engaged
in
advanced
research
in
the
humanities
in
making
its
grants
the
endowment
will
increase
its
emphasis
on
techniques
which
stimulate
support
for
the
humanities
from
nonfederal
sources
in
order
to
reinforce
our
tradition
of
private
philanthropy
in
this
field
and
to
insure
and
expand
the
financial
viability
of
our
cultural
institutions
and
life
insular
areas
i
have
been
firmly
committed
to
selfdetermination
for
puerto
rico
the
virgin
islands
guam
american
samoa
and
the
northern
mariana
islands
and
have
vigorously
supported
the
realization
of
whatever
political
status
aspirations
are
democratically
chosen
by
their
peoples
this
principle
was
the
keystone
of
the
comprehensive
territorial
policy
i
sent
the
congress
last
year
i
am
pleased
that
most
of
the
legislative
elements
of
that
policy
were
endorsed
by
the
th
congress
the
unique
cultures
fragile
economies
and
locations
of
our
caribbean
and
pacific
islands
are
distinct
assets
to
the
united
states
which
require
the
sensitive
application
of
policy
the
united
states
government
should
pursue
initiatives
begun
by
my
administration
and
the
congress
to
stimulate
insular
economic
development
enhance
treatment
under
federal
programs
eliminating
current
inequities
provide
vitally
needed
special
assistance
and
coordinate
and
rationalize
policies
these
measures
will
result
in
greater
selfsufficiency
and
balanced
growth
in
particular
i
hope
that
the
new
congress
will
support
funding
for
fiscal
management
comprehensive
planning
and
other
technical
assistance
for
the
territories
as
well
as
create
the
commission
i
have
proposed
to
review
the
applicability
of
all
federal
laws
to
the
insular
areas
and
make
recommendations
for
appropriate
modification
iv
removing
governmental
waste
and
inefficiency
one
of
my
major
commitments
has
been
to
restore
public
faith
in
our
federal
government
by
cutting
out
waste
and
inefficiency
in
the
past
four
years
we
have
made
dramatic
advances
toward
this
goal
many
of
them
previously
considered
impossible
to
achieve
where
government
rules
and
operations
were
unnecessary
they
have
been
eliminated
as
with
airline
rail
trucking
and
financial
deregulation
where
government
functions
are
needed
they
have
been
streamlined
through
such
landmark
measures
as
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
i
hope
that
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
will
keep
up
the
momentum
we
have
established
for
effective
and
responsible
change
in
this
area
of
crucial
public
concern
civil
service
reform
in
march
i
submitted
the
civil
service
reform
act
to
congress
i
called
it
the
centerpiece
of
my
efforts
to
reform
and
reorganize
the
government
with
bipartisan
support
from
congress
the
bill
passed
and
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
implementation
is
running
well
ahead
of
the
statutory
schedule
throughout
the

service
we
are
putting
into
place
the
means
to
assure
that
reward
and
retention
are
based
on
performance
and
not
simply
on
length
of
time
on
the
job
in
the
first
real
test
of
the
reform
act
percent
of
the
eligible
toplevel
managers
joined
the
senior
executive
service
choosing
to
relinquish
job
protections
for
the
challenge
and
potential
reward
of
this
new
corps
of
top
executives
though
the
act
does
not
require
several
of
its
key
elements
to
be
in
operation
for
another
year
some
federal
agencies
already
have
established
merit
pay
systems
for
gs
managers
and
most
agencies
are
well
on
their
way
to
establishing
new
performance
standards
for
all
their
employees
all
have
paid
out
or
are
now
in
the
process
of
paying
out
performance
bonuses
earned
by
outstanding
members
of
the
senior
executive
service
dismissals
have
increased
by
percent
and
dismissals
specifically
for
inadequate
job
performance
have
risen
percent
since
the
act
was
adopted
finally
we
have
established
a
fully
independent
merit
systems
protection
board
and
special
counsel
to
protect
the
rights
of
whistleblowers
and
other
federal
employees
faced
with
threats
to
their
rights
in
civil
service
reform
faces
critical
challenges
all
agencies
must
have
fully
functioning
performance
appraisal
systems
for
all
employees
and
merit
pay
systems
for
compensating
the
governments
gs
managers
performance
bonuses
for
members
of
the
senior
executive
service
will
surely
receive
scrutiny
if
this
attention
is
balanced
and
constructive
it
can
only
enhance
the
chances
for
ultimate
success
of
our
bipartisan
commitment
to
the
revolutionary
and
crucial
pay
for
performance
concept
regulatory
reform
during
the
past
four
years
we
have
made
tremendous
progress
in
regulatory
reform
we
have
discarded
old
economic
regulations
that
prevented
competition
and
raised
consumer
costs
and
we
have
imposed
strong
management
principles
on
the
regulatory
programs
the
country
needs
cutting
paperwork
and
other
wasteful
burdens
the
challenge
for
the
future
is
to
continue
the
progress
in
both
areas
without
crippling
vital
health
and
safety
programs
our
economic
deregulation
program
has
achieved
major
successes
in
five
areas
airlines
the
airline
deregulation
act
is
generating
healthy
competition
saving
billions
in
fares
and
making
the
airlines
more
efficient
the
act
provides
that
in
the
cab
itself
will
go
out
of
existence
trucking
the
trucking
deregulation
bill
opens
the
industry
to
competition
and
allows
truckers
wide
latitude
on
the
routes
they
drive
and
the
goods
they
haul
the
bill
also
phases
out
most
of
the
old
laws
immunity
for
setting
rates
the
congressional
budget
office
estimates
these
reforms
will
save
as
much
as
billion
per
year
and
cut
as
much
as
half
a
percentage
point
from
the
inflation
rate
railroads
overregulation
has
stifled
railroad
management
initiative
service
and
competitive
pricing
the
new
legislation
gives
the
railroads
the
freedom
they
need
to
rebuild
a
strong
efficient
railroad
industry
financial
institutions
with
the
help
of
the
congress
over
the
past
four
years
we
have
achieved
two
major
pieces
of
financial
reform
legislation
legislation
which
has
provided
the
basis
for
the
most
farreaching
changes
in
the
financial
services
industry
since
the
s
the
international
banking
act
of
was
designed
to
reduce
the
advantages
that
foreign
banks
operating
in
the
united
states
possessed
in
comparison
to
domestic
banks
the
depository
institutions
deregulation
and
monetary
control
act
adopted
last
march
provides
for
the
phased
elimination
of
a
variety
of
anticompetitive
barriers
to
financial
institutions
and
freedom
to
offer
services
to
and
attract
the
savings
of
consumers
especially
small
savers
recently
i
submitted
to
the
congress
my
administrations
recommendations
for
the
phased
liberalization
of
restrictions
on
geographic
expansion
by
commercial
banks
last
year
the
administration
and
financial
regulatory
agencies
proposed
legislation
to
permit
the
interstate
acquisition
of
failing
depository
institutions
in
view
of
the
difficult
outlook
for
some
depository
institutions
i
strongly
urge
the
congress
to
take
prompt
favorable
action
on
the
failing
bank
legislation
telecommunications
while
congress
did
not
pass
legislation
in
this
area
the
federal
communications
commission
has
taken
dramatic
action
to
open
all
aspects
of
communications
to
competition
and
to
eliminate
regulations
in
the
areas
where
competition
made
them
obsolete
the
public
is
benefitting
from
an
explosion
of
competition
and
new
services
while
these
initiatives
represent
dramatic
progress
in
economic
deregulation
continued
work
is
needed
i
urge
congress
to
act
on
communications
legislation
and
to
consider
other
proposed
deregulation
measures
such
as
legislation
on
the
bus
industry
in
addition
the
regulatory
commissions
must
maintain
their
commitment
to
competition
as
the
best
regulator
of
all
the
other
part
of
my
reform
program
covers
the
regulations
that
are
needed
to
protect
the
health
safety
and
welfare
of
our
citizens
for
these
regulations
my
administration
has
created
a
management
program
to
cut
costs
without
sacrificing
goals
under
my
executive
order
we
required
agencies
to
analyze
the
costs
of
their
major
new
rules
and
consider
alternative
approaches
such
as
performance
standards
and
voluntary
codes
that
may
make
rules
less
costly
and
more
flexible
we
created
the
regulatory
analysis
review
group
in
the
white
house
to
analyze
the
most
costly
proposed
new
rules
and
find
ways
to
improve
them
the
regulatory
council
was
established
to
provide
the
first
governmentwide
listing
of
upcoming
rules
and
eliminate
overlapping
and
conflicting
regulations
agencies
have
launched
sunset
programs
to
weed
out
outmoded
old
regulations
we
have
acted
to
encourage
public
participation
in
regulatory
decisionmaking
these
steps
have
already
saved
billions
of
dollars
in
regulatory
costs
and
slashed
thousands
of
outmoded
regulations
we
are
moving
steadily
toward
a
regulatory
system
that
provides
needed
protections
fairly
predictably
and
at
minimum
cost
i
urge
congress
to
continue
on
this
steady
path
and
resist
the
simplistic
solutions
that
have
been
proposed
as
alternatives
proposals
like
legislative
veto
and
increased
judicial
review
will
add
another
layer
to
the
regulatory
process
making
it
more
cumbersome
and
inefficient
the
right
approach
to
reform
is
to
improve
the
individual
statutes
where
they
need
change
and
to
ensure
that
the
regulatory
agencies
implement
those
statutes
sensibly
paperwork
reduction
the
federal
government
imposes
a
huge
paperwork
burden
on
business
local
government
and
the
private
sector
many
of
these
forms
are
needed
for
vital
government
functions
but
others
are
duplicative
overly
complex
or
obsolete
during
my
administration
we
cut
the
paperwork
burden
by
percent
and
we
created
procedures
to
continue
this
progress
the
new
paperwork
reduction
act
centralizes
in
omb
oversight
of
all
agencies
information
requirements
and
strengthens
ombs
authority
to
eliminate
needless
forms
the
paperwork
budget
process
which
i
established
by
executive
order
applies
the
discipline
of
the
budget
process
to
the
hours
of
reporting
time
imposed
on
the
public
forcing
agencies
to
scrutinize
all
their
forms
each
year
with
effective
implementation
these
steps
should
allow
further
substantial
paperwork
cuts
in
the
years
ahead
tightening
standards
for
governmental
efficiency
and
integrity
to
develop
a
foundation
to
carry
out
energy
policy
we
consolidated
scattered
energy
programs
and
launched
the
synthetic
fuels
corporation
to
give
education
the
priority
it
deserves
and
at
the
same
time
reduce
hhs
to
more
manageable
size
i
gave
education
a
seat
at
the
cabinet
table
to
create
a
stronger
system
for
attacking
waste
and
fraud
i
reorganized
audit
and
investigative
functions
by
putting
an
inspector
general
in
major
agencies
since
i
took
office
we
have
submitted
reorganization
initiatives
and
had
them
all
approved
by
congress
we
have
saved
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
through
the
adoption
of
businesslike
cash
management
principles
and
set
strict
standards
for
personal
financial
disclosure
and
conflict
of
interest
avoidance
by
high
federal
officials
to
streamline
the
structure
of
the
government
we
have
secured
approval
of
reorganization
initiatives
improving
the
efficiency
of
the
most
important
sectors
of
the
government
including
energy
education
and
civil
rights
enforcement
we
have
eliminated
more
than
advisory
committees
as
well
as
other
agencies
boards
and
commissions
which
were
obsolete
or
ineffective
independent
inspectors
general
have
been
appointed
in
major
agencies
to
attack
fraud
and
waste
more
than
a
billion
dollars
of
questionable
transactions
have
been
identified
through
their
audit
activities
the
adoption
of
businesslike
cash
management
and
debt
collection
initiatives
will
save
over
billion
by
streamlining
the
processing
of
receipts
by
controlling
disbursements
more
carefully
and
by
reducing
idle
cash
balances
finally
this
administration
has
set
strict
standards
for
personal
financial
disclosure
and
conflict
of
interest
avoidance
by
high
federal
officials
to
elevate
the
level
of
public
trust
in
the
government
v
protecting
basic
rights
and
liberties
i
am
extremely
proud
of
the
advances
we
have
made
in
ensuring
equality
and
protecting
the
basic
freedoms
of
all
americans
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
eeoc
and
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
ofccp
have
been
reorganized
and
strengthened
and
a
permanent
civil

unit
has
been
established
in
omb
to
avoid
fragmented
inconsistent
and
duplicative
enforcement
of
civil

the
enactment

we
have
begun
to
establish

of
the
equal

amendment
must
be
aggressively
pursued
only
one
year
remains
in
which
to
obtain
ratification
by
three
additional
states
the
congress
must
give
early
attention
to
a
number
of
important
bills
which
remain
these
bills
would
strengthen
the
laws
against

remain

strongly
as

to
the
ratification
of

amendment
as
a
result
of
our
efforts
in
the
equal

deadline
for

was
extended
for
three
years
we
have
now
one

and
three

left
we
cannot
afford
any
delay
in
marshalling
our
resources
and
efforts
to
obtain
the
ratification
of
those
three
additional
states
although
the
congress
has
no
official
role
in
the

process
at
this
point
you
do
have
the
ability
to
affect
public
opinion
and
the
support
of
state
legislators
for
the

i
urge
members
from
states
which
have
not
yet
ratified
the
equal

amendment
to
use
their
influence
to
secure
ratification
i
will
continue

to

of
fair

legislation
a
top
priority
of
the
incoming

the

is
pressing
and
a

must
be
the
primary
method
of
resolution
criminal
code
the
federal
criminal
laws
are
often
archaic
frequently
contradictory
and
imprecise
and
clearly
in
need
of
revision
and
codification
the
new
administration
should
continue
the
work
which
has
been
begun
to
develop
a
federal
criminal
code
which
simplifies
and
clarifies
our
criminal
laws
while
maintaining
our
basic
civil
liberties
and
protections
privacy
as
our
public
and
private
institutions
collect
more
and
more
information
and
as
communications
and
computer
technologies
advance
we
must
act
to
protect
the
personal
privacy
of
our
citizens
in
the
past
four
years
we
acted
on
the
report
of
the
privacy
commission
and
established
a
national
privacy
policy
we
worked
with
congress
to
pass
legislation
restricting
wiretaps
and
law
enforcement
access
to
bank
records
and
to
reporters
files
we
reduced
the
number
of
personal
files
held
by
the
government
and
restricted
the
transfer
of
personal
information
among
federal
agencies
we
also
worked
with
the
organization
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
to
establish
international
guidelines
to
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
information
that
is
transferred
across
borders
vi
protecting
and
developing
our
natural
resources
two
of
our
nations
most
precious
natural
resources
are
our
environment
and
our
vast
agricultural
capacity
from
the
beginning
of
my
administration
i
have
worked
with
the
congress
to
enhance
and
protect
as
well
as
develop
our
natural
resources
in
the
environmental
areas
i
have
been
especially
concerned
about
the
importance
of
balancing
the
need
for
resource
development
with
preserving
a
clean
environment
and
have
taken
numerous
actions
to
foster
this
goal
in
the
agricultural
area
i
have
taken
the
steps
needed
to
improve
farm
incomes
and
to
increase
our
agricultural
production
to
record
levels
that
progress
must
be
continued
in
the
s
environment
preserving
the
quality
of
our
environment
has
been
among
the
most
important
objectives
of
my
administration
and
of
the
congress
as
a
result
of
these
shared
commitments
and
the
dedicated
efforts
of
many
members
of
the
congress
and
my
administration
we
have
achieved
several
historic
accomplishments
protection
of
alaska
lands
passage
of
the
alaska
national
interest
lands
conservation
act
was
one
of
the
most
important
conservation
actions
of
this
century
at
stake
was
the
fate
of
millions
of
acres
of
beautiful
land
outstanding
and
unique
wildlife
populations
native
cultures
and
the
opportunity
to
ensure
that
future
generations
of
americans
would
be
able
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
these
nationally
significant
resources
as
a
result
of
the
leadership
commitment
and
persistence
of
my
administration
and
the
congressional
leadership
the
alaska
lands
bill
was
signed
into
law
last
december
the
act
adds
million
acres
of
new
parks
and
refuges
more
than
doubling
the
size
of
our
national
park
and
national
wildlife
refuge
systems
the
bill
triples
the
size
of
our
national
wilderness
system
increasing
its
size
by
million
acres
and
by
adding
freeflowing
river
segments
to
the
wild
and
scenic
river
system
the
bill
almost
doubles
the
river
mileage
in
that
system
the
alaska
lands
act
reaffirms
our
commitment
to
the
environment
and
strikes
a
balance
between
protecting
areas
of
great
beauty
and
allowing
development
of
alaskas
oil
gas
mineral
and
timber
resources
protection
of
natural
resources
in
addition
to
the
alaska
lands
act
over
the
past
four
years
we
have
been
able
to
expand
significantly
the
national
wilderness
and
parks
systems
in
the
congress
passed
the
historical
omnibus
parks
act
which
made
additions
to
the
national
park
system
the
act
also
established
the
first
two
national
trails
since
the
national
trails
system
act
was
passed
in
then
in
as
a
result
of
my
environmental
message
the
federal
land
management
agencies
have
established
almost
new
national
recreational
trails
with
the
completion
of
the
rare
ii
process
which
eliminated
the
uncertainty
surrounding
the
status
of
millions
of
acres
of
land
we
called
for
over
million
acres
of
new
wilderness
in
the
nations
national
forest
in
the
congress
established
about
million
acres
of
wilderness
in
the
lower
states
in
addition
the
administration
recommended
legislation
to
protect
lake
tahoe
and
through
an
executive
order
has
already
established
a
mechanism
to
help
ensure
the
lakes
protection
finally
in
the
administration
established
the
channel
islands
marine
sanctuary
administration
actions
over
the
past
four
years
stressed
the
importance
of
providing
federal
support
only
for
water
resource
projects
that
are
economically
and
environmentally
sound
this
policy
should
have
a
major
and
lasting
influence
on
the
federal
governments
role
in
water
resource
development
and
management
the
administrations
actions
to
recommend
to
the
congress
only
economically
and
environmentally
sound
water
resource
projects
for
funding
resulted
not
only
in
our
opposing
uneconomic
projects
but
also
in
in
the
first
administration
proposal
of
new
project
starts
in
years
one
of
the
most
significant
water
policy
actions
of
the
past
four
years
was
the
administrations
june
water
policy
reform
message
to
the
congress
this
message
established
a
new
national
water
resources
policy
with
the
following
objectives
to
give
priority
emphasis
to
water
conservation
to
consider
environmental
requirements
and
values
more
fully
and
along
with
economic
factors
in
the
planning
and
management
of
water
projects
and
programs
to
enhance
cooperation
between
state
and
federal
agencies
in
water
resources
planning
and
management
in
addition
the
executive
office
of
the
president
established
policy
decision
criteria
to
evaluate
the
proposed
federal
water
projects
the
water
resources
council
developed
and
adopted
a
new
set
of
principles
and
standards
for
water
projects
which
is
binding
on
all
federal
construction
agencies
and
improved
regulations
were
developed
to
implement
the
national
historic
preservation
act
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
coordination
act
as
a
result
water
resource
projects
must
be
determined
to
be
economically
sound
before
the
administration
will
recommend
authorization
or
appropriation
over
the
years
ahead
this
policy
will
help
to
reduce
wasteful
federal
spending
by
targeting
federal
funds
to
the
highest
priority
water
resource
projects
in
the
pursuit
of
this
policy
however
we
cannot
lose
projects
in
the
part
that
sound
water
resource
projects
play
in
providing
irrigation
power
and
flood
control
we
must
also
recognize
the
special
needs
of
particular
regions
of
the
country
in
evaluating
the
need
for
additional
projects
addressing
global
resource
and
environmental
problems
the
global
report
to
the
president
prepared
in
response
to
my
environment
message
is
the
first
of
its
kind
never
before
has
our
government
or
any
government
taken
such
a
comprehensive
longrange
look
at
the
interrelated
global
issues
of
resources
population
and
environment
the
reports
conclusions
are
important
they
point
to
a
rapid
increase
in
population
and
human
needs
through
the
year
while
at
the
same
time
a
decline
in
the
earths
capacity
to
meet
those
needs
unless
nations
of
the
world
act
decisively
to
alter
current
trends
the
united
states
has
contributed
actively
to
a
series
of
un
conferences
on
the
environment
population
and
resources
and
is
preparing
for
the
conference
on
new
and
renewable
sources
of
energy
following
my
environmental
message
the
administration
development
assistance
programs
have
added
emphasis
to
natural
resource
management
and
environmental
protection
my
environmental
message
called
attention
to
the
alarming
loss
of
world
forests
particula
rly
in
the
tropics
an
interagency
task
force
on
tropical
forests
has
developed
a
us
government
program
to
encourage
conservation
and
wise
management
of
tropical
forests
the
administration
is
encouraging
action
by
other
nations
and
world
organizations
to
the
same
purpose
the
united
states
is
a
world
leader
in
wildlife
conservation
and
the
assessment
of
environmental
effects
of
government
actions
the
january
executive
order
directing
us
government
agencies
to
consider
the
effects
of
their
major
actions
abroad
is
another
example
of
this
leadership
commitment
to
control
of
pollution
and
hazardous
chemicals
over
the
past
four
years
there
has
been
steady
progress
towards
cleaner
air
and
water
sustained
by
the
commitment
of
congress
and
the
administration
to
these
important
national
objectives
in
addition
the
administration
has
developed
several
new
pollution
compliance
approaches
such
as
alternative
and
innovative
waste
water
treatment
projects
the
bubble
concept
the
offset
policy
and
permit
consolidation
all
of
which
are
designed
to
reduce
regulatory
burdens
on
the
private
sector
one
of
the
most
pressing
problems
to
come
to
light
in
the
past
four
years
has
been
improper
hazardous
waste
disposal
the
administration
has
moved
on
three
fronts
first
we
proposed
the
oil
hazardous
substances
and
hazardous
waste
response
liability
and
compensation
act
the
superfund
bill
to
provide
comprehensive
authority
and
billion
in
funds
to
clean
up
abandoned
hazardous
waste
disposal
sites
in
november
the
congress
passed
a
superfund
bill
which
i
signed
into
law
second
the
administration
established
a
hazardous
waste
enforcement
strike
force
to
ensure
that
when
available
responsible
parties
are
required
to
clean
up
sites
posing
dangers
to
public
health
and
to
the
environment
to
date
lawsuits
have
been
brought
by
the
strike
force
third
regulations
implementing
subtitle
c
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
were
issued
the
regulations
establish
comprehensive
controls
for
hazardous
waste
and
together
with
vigorous
enforcement
will
help
to
ensure
that
love
canal
will
not
be
repeated
the
future
for
the
future
we
cannot
and
we
must
not
forget
that
we
are
charged
with
the
stewardship
of
an
irreplaceable
environment
and
natural
heritage
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
are
dependent
upon
our
maintaining
our
commitment
to
preserving
and
enhancing
the
quality
of
our
environment
it
is
my
hope
that
when
our
descendants
look
back
on
the
s
they
will
be
able
to
affirm
that
we
kept
our
commitment
to
the
restoration
of
environmental
quality
that
we
protected
the
public
health
from
the
continuing
dangers
of
toxic
chemicals
from
pollution
from
hazardous
and
radioactive
waste
and
that
we
made
our
communities
safer
healthier
and
better
places
to
live
that
we
preserved
americas
wilderness
areas
and
particularly
its
last
great
frontier
alaska
for
the
benefit
of
all
americans
in
perpetuity
that
we
put
this
nation
on
a
path
to
a
sustainable
energy
future
one
based
increasingly
on
renewable
resources
and
on
energy
conservation
that
we
moved
to
protect
americas
countryside
and
coastland
from
mismanagement
and
irresponsibility
that
we
redirected
the
management
of
the
nations
water
resources
toward
water
conservation
sound
development
and
environmental
protection
that
we
faced
squarely
such
worldwide
problems
as
the
destruction
of
forests
acid
rain
carbon
dioxide
buildup
and
nuclear
proliferation
and
that
we
protected
the
habitat
and
the
existence
of
our
own
species
on
this
earth
agriculture
the
farm
economy
the
farm
economy
is
sound
and
its
future
is
bright
agriculture
remains
a
major
bulwark
of
the
nations
economy
and
an
even
more
important
factor
in
the
world
food
system
the
demand
for
americas
agricultural
abundance
here
and
abroad
continues
to
grow
in
the
nearterm
the
strength
of
this
demand
is
expected
to
press
hard
against
supplies
resulting
in
continued
price
strength
the
health
and
vitality
of
currentday
agriculture
represents
a
significant
departure
from
the
situation
that
existed
when
i
came
to
office
four
years
ago
in
january
the
farm
economy
was
in
serious
trouble
farm
prices
and
farm
income
were
falling
rapidly
grain
prices
were
at
their
lowest
levels
in
years
and
steadily
falling
livestock
producers
in
their
fourth
straight
year
of
record
losses
were
liquidating
breeding
herds
at
an
unparalleled
rate
dairy
farmers
were
losing
money
on
every
hundredweight
of
milk
they
produced
sugar
prices
were
in
a
nosedive
through
a
combination
of
improvements
in
old
established
programs
and
the
adoption
of
new
approaches
where
innovation
and
change
were
needed
my
administration
turned
this
situation
around
commodity
prices
have
steadily
risen
farm
income
turned
upward
us
farm
exports
set
new
records
each
year
increasing
over
percent
for
the
four
year
period
livestock
producers
began
rebuilding
their
herds
dairy
farmers
began
to
earn
a
profit
again
recent
policy
initiatives
several
major
agricultural
policy
initiatives
have
been
undertaken
over
the
past
year
some
are
the
culmination
of
policy
proposals
made
earlier
in
this
administration
others
are
measures
taken
to
help
farmers
offset
the
impact
of
rapid
inflation
in
production
costs
in
combination
they
represent
a
significant
strengthening
of
our
nations
food
and
agricultural
policy
these
initiatives
include
food
security
reserve
the
congress
authorized
formation
of
a
million
ton
food
grain
reserve
for
use
in
international
food
assistance
this
reserve
makes
it
possible
for
the
united
states
to
stand
behind
its
food
aid
commitment
to
food
deficit
nations
even
during
periods
of
short
supplies
and
high
prices
this
corrects
a
serious
fault
in
our
past
food
assistance
policy
comprehensive
crop
insurance
the
congress
also
authorized
a
significant
new
crop
insurance
program
during
this
measure
provides
farmers
with
an
important
new
program
tool
for
sharing
the
economic
risks
that
are
inherent
to
agriculture
when
fully
operational
it
will
replace
a
hodgepodge
of
disaster
programs
that
suffered
from
numerous
shortcomings
special
loan
rates
another
legislative
measure
passed
late
in
the
nd
session
of
the
th
congress
authorizes
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
provide
higher
loan
rates
to
farmers
who
enter
their
grain
in
the
farmerowned
grain
reserve
this
additional
incentive
to
participate
will
further
strengthen
the
reserve
increased
loan
prices
in
july
i
administratively
raised
loan
prices
for
wheat
feedgrains
and
soybeans
to
help
offset
the
effects
of
a
serious
costprice
squeeze
at
the
same
time
the
release
and
call
prices
for
the
grain
reserve
were
adjusted
upward
higher
target
prices
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
of
raised
the
target
prices
for
crop
wheat
and
feed
grain
crops
this
change
corrected
for
shortcomings
in
the
adjustment
formula
contained
in
the
food
and
agriculture
act
of
future
agenda
the
food
and
agricultural
policies
adopted
by
this
administration
over
the
past
four
years
including
those
described
above
will
provide
a
firm
foundation
for
future
governmental
actions
in
this
field
expiration
of
the
food
and
agriculture
act
of
later
this
year
will
require
early
attention
by
the
congress
with
relatively
minor
changes
most
of
the
authorities
contained
in
the
act
should
be
extended
in
their
present
form
the
farmerowned
grain
reserve
has
proven
to
be
a
particularly
effective
means
of
stabilizing
grain
markets
and
should
be
preserved
in
essentially
its
present
form
beyond
this
it
will
be
important
for
the
congress
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
pricecost
developments
in
the
farm
sector
as
noted
above
some
of
the
actions
i
took
last
year
were
for
the
purpose
of
providing
relief
from
the
costprice
squeeze
facing
farmers
should
these
pressures
continue
further
actions
might
be
required
my
administration
has
devoted
particular
attention
to
the
issues
of
world
hunger
agricultural
land
use
and
the
future
structure
of
american
agriculture
i
encourage
the
congress
and
the
next
administration
to
review
the
results
of
these
landmark
enquiries
and
where
deemed
appropriate
to
act
on
their
recommendations
following
a
careful
review
of
the
situation
i
recently
extended
the
suspension
of
grain
sales
to
the
soviet
union
i
am
satisfied
that
this
action
has
served
its
purpose
effectively
and
fairly
however
as
long
as
this
suspension
must
remain
in
effect
it
will
be
important
for
the
next
administration
and
the
congress
to
take
whatever
actions
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
burden
does
not
fall
unfairly
on
our
nations
farmers
this
has
been
a
key
feature
of
my
administrations
policy
and
it
should
be
maintained
vii
foreign
policy
from
the
time
i
assumed
office
four
years
ago
this
month
i
have
stressed
the
need
for
this
country
to
assert
a
leading
role
in
a
world
undergoing
the
most
extensive
and
intensive
change
in
human
history
my
policies
have
been
directed
in
particular
at
three
areas
of
change
the
steady
growth
and
increased
projection
abroad
of
soviet
military
power
power
that
has
grown
faster
than
our
own
over
the
past
two
decades
the
overwhelming
dependence
of
western
nations
which
now
increasingly
includes
the
united
states
on
vital
oil
supplies
from
the
middle
east
the
pressures
of
change
in
many
nations
of
the
developing
world
in
iran
and
uncertainty
about
the
future
stability
of
many
developing
countries
as
a
result
of
those
fundamental
facts
we
face
some
of
the
most
serious
challenges
in
the
history
of
this
nation
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
is
a
threat
to

and
to

stable

as
the
unprecedented
relations
an
and
overwhelming
vote
in
the
general
assembly
demonstrated
countries
across
the
world
and
particularly
the
nonaligned
regard
the
soviet
invasion
as
a
threat
to
their
independence
and
security
turmoil
within
the
region
adjacent
to
the
persian
gulf
poses
risks
for
the
security
and
prosperity
of
every
oil
importing
nation
and
thus
for
the
entire
global
economy
the
continuing
holding
of
american
hostages
in
iran
is
both
an
affront
to
civilized
peopl
e
everywhere
and
a
serious
impediment
to
meeting
the
selfevident
threat
to
widelyshared
common
interests
including
those
of
iran
but
as
we
focus
our
most
urgent
efforts
on
pressing
problems
we
will
continue
to
pursue
the
benefits
that
only
change
can
bring
for
it
always
has
been
the
essence
of
america
that
we
want
to
move
on
we
understand
that
prosperity
progress
and
most
of
all
peace
cannot
be
had
by
standing
still
a
world
of
nations
striving
to
preserve
their
independence
and
of
peoples
aspiring
for
economic
development
and
political
freedom
is
not
a
world
hostile
to
the
ideals
and
interests
of
the
united
states
we
face
powerful
adversaries
but
we
have
strong
friends
and
dependable
allies
we
have
common
interests
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
worlds
nations
and
peoples
there
have
been
encouraging
developments
in
recent
years
as
well
as
matters
requiring
continued
vigilance
and
concern
our
alliances
with
the
worlds
most
advanced
and
democratic
states
from
western
europe
through
japan
are
stronger
than
ever
we
have
helped
to
bring
about
a
dramatic
improvement
in
relations
between
egypt
and
israel
and
an
historic
step
towards
a
comprehensive
arabisraeli
settlement
our
relations
with
china
are
growing
closer
providing
a
major
new
dimension
in
our
policy
in
asia
and
the
world
across
southern
africa
from
rhodesia
to
namibia
we
are
helping
with
the
peaceful
transition
to
majority
rule
in
a
context
of
respect
for
minority
as
well
as
majority
rights
we
have
worked
domestically
and
with
our
allies
to
respond
to
an
uncertain
energy
situation
by
conservation
and
diversification
of
energy
supplies
based
on
internationally
agreed
targets
we
have
unambiguously
demonstrated
our
commitment
to
defend
western
interests
in
southwest
asia
and
we
have
significantly
increased
our
ability
to
do
so
and
over
the
past
four
years
the
us
has
developed
an
energy
program
which
is
comprehensive
and
ambitious
new
institutions
have
been
established
such
as
the
synthetic
fuels
corporation
and
solar
bank
price
decontrol
for
oil
and
gas
is
proceeding
american
consumers
have
risen
to
the
challenge
and
we
have
experienced
real
improvements
in
consumption
patterns
the
central
challenge
for
us
today
is
to
our
steadfastedness
of
purpose
we
are
no
longer
tempted
by
isolationism
but
we
must
also
learn
to
deal
effectively
with
the
contradictions
of
the
world
the
need
to
cooperate
with
potential
adversaries
without
euphoria
without
undermining
our
determination
to
compete
with
such
adversaries
and
if
necessary
confront
the
threats
they
may
pose
to
our
security
we
face
a
broad
range
of
threats
and
opportunities
we
have
and
should
continue
to
pursue
a
broad
range
of
defense
diplomatic
and
economic
capabilities
and
objectives
i
see
six
basic
goals
for
america
in
the
world
over
the
s
first
we
will
continue
as
we
have
over
the
past
four
years
to
build
americas
military
strength
and
that
of
our
allies
and
friends
neither
the
soviet
union
nor
any
other
nation
will
have
reason
to
question
our
will
to
sustain
the
strongest
and
most
flexible
defense
forces
second
we
will
pursue
an
active
diplomacy
in
the
world
working
together
with
our
friends
and
allies
to
resolve
disputes
through
peaceful
means
and
to
make
any
aggressor
pay
a
heavy
price
third
we
will
strive
to
resolve
pressing
international
economic
problems
particularly
energy
and
inflation
and
continue
to
pursue
our
still
larger
objective
of
global
economic
growth
through
expanded
trade
and
development
assistance
and
through
the
preservation
of
an
open
multilateral
trading
system
fourth
we
will
continue
vigorously
to
support
the
process
of
building
democratic
institutions
and
improving
human
rights
protection
around
the
world
we
are
deeply
convinced
that
the
future
lies
not
with
dictatorship
but
democracy
fifth
we
remain
deeply
committed
to
the
process
of
mutual
and
verifiable
arms
control
particularly
to
the
effort
to
prevent
the
spread
and
further
development
of
nuclear
weapons
our
decision
to
defer
but
not
abandon
our
efforts
to
secure
ratification
of
the
salt
ii
treaty
reflects
our
firm
conviction
that
the
united
states
has
a
profound
national
security
interest
in
the
constraints
on
soviet
nuclear
forces
which
only
that
treaty
can
provide
sixth
we
must
continue
to
look
ahead
in
order
to
evaluate
and
respond
to
resource
environment
and
population
challenges
through
the
end
of
this
century
one
very
immediate
and
pressing
objective
that
is
uppermost
on
our
minds
and
those
of
the
american
people
is
the
release
of
our
hostages
in
iran
we
have
no
basic
quarrel
with
the
nation
the
revolution
or
the
people
of
iran
the
threat
to
them
comes
not
from
american
policy
but
from
soviet
actions
in
the
region
we
are
prepared
to
work
with
the
government
of
iran
to
develop
a
new
and
mutually
beneficial
relationship
but
that
will
not
be
possible
so
long
as
iran
continues
to
hold
americans
hostages
in
defiance
of
the
world
community
and
civilized
behavior
they
must
be
released
unharmed
we
have
thus
far
pursued
a
measured
program
of
peaceful
diplomatic
and
economic
steps
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
this
issue
without
resorting
to
other
remedies
available
to
us
under
international
law
this
reflects
the
deep
respect
of
our
nation
for
the
rule
of
law
and
for
the
safety
of
our
people
being
held
and
our
belief
that
a
great
power
bears
a
responsibility
to
use
its
strength
in
a
measured
and
judicious
manner
but
our
patience
is
not
unlimited
and
our
concern
for
the
wellbeing
of
our
fellow
citizens
grows
each
day
enhancing
national
security
american
military
strength
the
maintenance
of
national
security
is
my
first
concern
as
it
has
been
for
every
president
before
me
we
must
have
both
the
military
power
and
the
political
will
to
deter
our
adversaries
and
to
support
our
friends
and
allies
we
must
pay
whatever
price
is
required
to
remain
the
strongest
nation
in
the
world
that
price
has
increased
as
the
military
power
of
our
major
adversary
has
grown
and
its
readiness
to
use
that
power
been
made
all
too
evident
in
afghanistan
the
real
increases
in
defense
spending
therefore
probably
will
be
higher
than
previously
projected
protecting
our
security
may
require
a
larger
share
of
our
national
wealth
in
the
future
the
ussoviet
relationship
we
are
demonstrating
to
the
soviet
union
across
a
broad
front
that
it
will
pay
a
heavy
price
for
its
aggression
in
terms
of
our
relationship
throughout
the
last
decades
ussoviet
relations
have
been
a
mixture
of
cooperation
and
competition
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
and
the
imposition
of
a
puppet
government
have
highlighted
in
the
starkest
terms
the
darker
side
of
their
policies
going
well
beyond
competition
and
the
legitimate
pursuit
of
national
interest
and
violating
all
norms
of
international
law
and
practice
this
attempt
to
subjugate
an
independent
nonaligned
islamic
people
is
a
callous
violation
of
international
law
and
the
united
nations
charter
two
fundamentals
of
international
order
hence
it
is
also
a
dangerous
threat
to
world
peace
for
the
first
time
since
the
communization
of
eastern
europe
after
world
war
ii
the
soviets
have
sent
combat
forces
into
an
area
that
was
not
previously
under
their
control
into
a
nonaligned
and
sovereign
state
the
destruction
of
the
independence
of
the
afghanistan
government
and
the
occupation
by
the
soviet
union
have
altered
the
strategic
situation
in
that
part
of
the
world
in
a
very
ominous
fashion
it
has
significantly
shortened
the
striking
distance
to
the
indian
ocean
and
the
persian
gulf
for
the
soviet
union
it
has
also
eliminated
a
buffer
between
the
soviet
union
and
pakistan
and
presented
a
new
threat
to
iran
these
two
countries
are
now
far
more
vulnerable
to
soviet
political
intimidation
if
that
intimidation
were
to
prove
effective
the
soviet
union
could
control
an
area
of
vital
strategic
and
economic
significance
to
the
survival
of
western
europe
the
far
east
and
ultimately
the
united
states
it
has
now
been
over
a
year
since
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
dealt
a
major
blow
to
ussoviet
relations
and
the
entire
international
system
the
us
response
has
proven
to
be
serious
and
farreaching
it
has
been
increasingly
effective
imposing
real
and
sustained
costs
on
the
ussrs
economy
and
international
image
meanwhile
we
have
encouraged
and
supported
efforts
to
reach
a
political
settlement
in
afghanistan
which
would
lead
to
a
withdrawal
of
soviet
forces
from
that
country
and
meet
the
interests
of
all
concerned
it
is
soviet
intransigence
that
has
kept
those
efforts
from
bearing
fruit
meanwhile
an
overwhelming
november
resolution
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
on
afghanistan
has
again
made
clear
that
the
world
has
not
and
will
not
forget
afghanistan
and
our
response
continues
to
make
it
clear
that
soviet
use
of
force
in
pursuit
of
its
international
objectives
is
incompatible
with
the
notion
of
businessasusual
bilateral
communication
ussoviet
relations
remain
strained
by
the
continued
soviet
presence
in
afghanistan
by
growing
soviet
military
capabilities
and
by
the
soviets
apparent
willingness
to
use
those
capabilities
without
respect
for
the
most
basic
norms
of
international
behavior
but
the
ussoviet
relationship
remains
the
single
most
important
element
in
determining
whether
there
will
be
war
or
peace
and
so
despite
serious
strains
in
our
relations
we
have
maintained
a
dialogue
with
the
soviet
union
over
the
past
year
through
this
dialogue
we
have
ensured
against
bilateral
misunderstandings
and
miscalculations
which
might
escalate
out
of
control
and
have
managed
to
avoid
the
injection
of
superpower
rivalries
into
areas
of
tension
like
the
iraniraq
conflict
poland
now
as
was
the
case
a
year
ago
the
prospect
of
soviet
use
of
force
threatens
the
international
order
the
soviet
union
has
completed
preparations
for
a
possible
military
intervention
against
poland
although
the
situation
in
poland
has
shown
signs
of
stabilizing
recently
soviet
forces
remain
in
a
high
state
of
readiness
and
they
could
move
into
poland
on
short
notice
we
continue
to
believe
that
t
he
polish
people
should
be
allowed
to
work
out
their
internal
problems
themselves
without
outside
interference
and
we
have
made
clear
to
the
soviet
leadership
that
any
intervention
in
poland
would
have
severe
and
prolonged
consequences
for
eastwest
detente
and
ussoviet
relations
in
particular
defense
budget
for
many
years
the
soviets
have
steadily
increased
their
real
defense
spending
expanded
their
strategic
forces
strengthened
their
forces
in
europe
and
asia
and
enhanced
their
capability
for
projecting
military
force
around
the
world
directly
or
through
the
use
of
proxies
afghanistan
dramatizes
the
vastly
increased
military
power
of
the
soviet
union
the
soviet
union
has
built
a
war
machine
far
beyond
any
reasonable
requirements
for
their
own
defense
and
security
in
contrast
our
own
defense
spending
declined
in
real
terms
every
year
from
through
we
have
reversed
this
decline
in
our
own
effort
every
year
since
there
has
been
a
real
increase
in
our
defense
spending
and
our
lead
has
encouraged
increases
by
our
allies
with
the
support
of
the
congress
we
must
and
will
make
an
even
greater
effort
in
the
years
ahead
the
fiscal
year
budget
would
increase
funding
authority
for
defense
to
more
than
billion
this
amount
together
with
a
supplemental
request
for
fy
of
about
billion
will
more
than
meet
my
administrations
pledge
for
a
sustained
growth
of
percent
in
real
expenditures
and
provides
for
percent
in
program
growth
in
fy
and
beyond
the
trends
we
mean
to
correct
cannot
be
remedied
overnight
we
must
be
willing
to
see
this
program
through
to
ensure
that
we
do
so
i
am
setting
a
growth
rate
for
defense
that
we
can
sustain
over
the
long
haul
the
defense
program
i
have
proposed
for
the
next
five
years
will
require
some
sacrifice
but
sacrifice
we
can
well
afford
the
defense
program
emphasizes
four
areas
it
ensures
that
our
strategic
nuclear
forces
will
be
equivalent
to
those
of
the
soviet
union
and
that
deterrence
against
nuclear
war
will
be
maintained
it
upgrades
our
forces
so
that
the
military
balance
between
nato
and
the
warsaw
pact
will
continue
to
deter
the
outbreak
of
war
conventional
or
nuclear
in
europe
it
provides
us
the
ability
to
come
quickly
to
the
aid
of
friends
and
allies
around
the
globe
and
it
ensures
that
our
navy
will
continue
to
be
the
most
powerful
on
the
seas
strategic
forces
we
are
strengthening
each
of
the
three
legs
of
our
strategic
forces
the
cruise
missile
production
which
will
begin
next
year
will
modernize
our
strategic
air
deterrent
b
capabilities
will
also
be
improved
these
steps
will
maintain
and
enhance
the
b
fleet
by
improving
its
ability
to
deliver
weapons
against
increasingly
heavily
defended
targets
we
are
also
modernizing
our
strategic
submarine
force
four
more
poseidon
submarines
backfitted
with
new
mile
trident
i
missiles
began
deployments
in
nine
trident
submarines
have
been
authorized
through
and
we
propose
one
more
each
year
the
new
mx
missile
program
to
enhance
our
landbased
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
force
continues
to
make
progress
technical
refinements
in
the
basing
design
over
the
last
year
will
result
in
operational
benefits
lower
costs
and
reduced
environmental
impact
the
mx
program
continues
to
be
an
essential
ingredient
in
our
strategic
posture
providing
survivability
endurance
secure
command
and
control
and
the
capability
to
threaten
targets
the
soviets
hold
dear
our
new
systems
will
enable
us
strategic
forces
to
maintain
equivalence
in
the
face
of
the
mounting
soviet
challenge
we
would
however
need
an
even
greater
investment
in
strategic
systems
to
meet
the
likely
soviet
buildup
without
salt
strategic
doctrine
this
administrations
systematic
contributions
to
the
necessary
evolution
of
strategic
doctrine
began
in
when
i
commissioned
a
comprehensive
net
assessment
from
that
base
a
number
of
thorough
investigations
of
specific
topics
continued
i
should
emphasize
that
the
need
for
an
evolutionary
doctrine
is
driven
not
by
any
change
in
our
basic
objective
which
remains
peace
and
freedom
for
all
mankind
rather
the
need
for
change
is
driven
by
the
inexorable
buildup
of
soviet
military
power
and
the
increasing
propensity
of
soviet
leaders
to
use
this
power
in
coercion
and
outright
aggression
to
impose
their
will
on
others
i
have
codified
our
evolving
strategic
doctrine
in
a
number
of
interrelated
and
mutually
supporting
presidential
directives
their
overarching
theme
is
to
provide
a
doctrinal
basis
and
the
specific
program
to
implement
it
that
tells
the
world
that
no
potential
adversary
of
the
united
states
could
ever
conclude
that
the
fruits
of
his
aggression
would
be
significant
or
worth
the
enormous
costs
of
our
retaliation
the
presidential
directives
include
pd
an
overview
of
our
strategic
objectives
pd
basic
space
policy
pd
civil
defense
pd
survivability
and
endurance
for
telecommunications
pd
mobilization
planning
pd
continuity
of
government
pd
countervailing
strategy
for
general
war
these
policies
have
been
devised
to
deter
first
and
foremost
soviet
aggression
as
such
they
confront
not
only
soviet
military
forces
but
also
soviet
military
doctrine
by
definition
deterrence
requires
that
we
shape
soviet
assessments
about
the
risks
of
war
assessments
they
will
make
using
their
doctrine
not
ours
but
at
the
same
time
we
in
no
way
seek
to
emulate
their
doctrine
in
particular
nothing
in
our
policy
contemplates
that
nuclear
warfare
could
ever
be
a
deliberate
instrument
for
achieving
our
own
goals
of
peace
and
freedom
moreover
our
policies
are
carefully
devised
to
provide
the
greatest
possible
incentives
and
opportunities
for
future
progress
in
arms
control
finally
our
doctrinal
evolution
has
been
undertaken
with
appropriate
consultation
with
our
nato
allies
and
others
we
are
fully
consistent
with
natos
strategy
of
flexible
response
forces
for
nato
we
are
greatly
accelerating
our
ability
to
reinforce
western
europe
with
massive
ground
and
air
forces
in
a
crisis
we
are
undertaking
a
major
modernization
program
for
the
armys
weapons
and
equipment
adding
armor
firepower
and
tactical
mobility
we
are
prepositioning
more
heavy
equipment
in
europe
to
help
us
cope
with
attacks
with
little
warning
and
greatly
strengthening
our
airlift
and
sealift

we
are
also
improving
our
tactical

buying
about
new

and
attack
aircraft
over
the
next
five
years
and
increasing
the
number
of

by
over

we
are
working
closely
with
our
european

to
secure
the

necessary
to
enable

security
assistance
as
we
move
to
enhance
us
defense
capabilities
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
need
to
assist
others
in
maintaining
their
own
security
and
independence
events
since
world
war
ii
most
recently
in
southwest
asia
have
amply
demonstrated
that
us
security
cannot
exist
in
a
vacuum
and
that
our
own
prospects
for
peace
are
closely
tied
to
those
of
our
friends
the
security
assistance
programs
which
i
am
proposing
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
thus
directly
promote
vital
us
foreign
policy
and
national
security
aims
and
are
integral
parts
of
our
efforts
to
improve
and
upgrade
our
own
military
forces
more
specifically
these
programs
which
are
part
of
our
overall
foreign
aid
request
promote
us
security
in
two
principal
ways
first
they
assist
friendly
and
allied
nations
to
develop
the
capability
to
defend
themselves
and
maintain
their
own
independence
an
example
during
this
past
year
was
the
timely
support
provided
thailand
to
help
bolster
that
countrys
defenses
against
the
large
numbers
of
sovietbacked
vietnamese
troops
ranged
along
its
eastern
frontier
in
addition
over
the
years
these
programs
have
been
important
to
the
continued
independence
of
other
friends
and
allies
such
as
israel
greece
turkey
and
korea
second
security
assistance
constitutes
an
essential
element
in
the
broad
cooperative
relationships
we
have
established
with
many
nations
which
permit
either
us
bases
on
their
territory
or
access
by
us
forces
to
their
facilities
these
programs
have
been
particularly
important
with
regard
to
the
recentlyconcluded
access
agreements
with
various
countries
in
the
persian
gulf
and
indian
ocean
regions
and
have
been
crucial
to
the
protection
of
our
interests
throughout
southwest
asia
rapid
deployment
forces
we
are
systematically
enhancing
our
ability
to
respond
rapidly
to
nonnato
contingencies
wherever
required
by
our
commitments
or
when
our
vital
interests
are
threatened
the
rapid
deployment
forces
we
are
assembling
will
be
extraordinarily
flexible
they
could
range
in
size
from
a
few
ships
or
air
squadrons
to
formations
as
large
as
men
together
with
their
support
our
forces
will
be
prepared
for
rapid
deployment
to
any
region
of
strategic
significance
among
the
specific
initiatives
we
are
taking
to
help
us
respond
to
crises
outside
of
europe
are
the
development
of
a
new
fleet
of
large
cargo
aircraft
with
intercontinental
range
the
design
and
procurement
of
a
force
of
maritime
prepositioning
ships
that
will
carry
heavy
equipment
and
supplies
for
three
marine
corps
brigades
the
procurement
of
fast
sealift
ships
to
move
large
quantities
of
men
and
material
quickly
from
the
us
to
overseas
areas
of
deployment
increasing
training
and
exercise
activities
to
ensure
that
our
forces
will
be
well
prepared
to
deploy
and
operate
in
distant
areas
in
addition
our
european
allies
have
agreed
on
the
importance
of
providing
support
to
us
deployments
to
southwest
asia
naval
forces
seapower
is
indispensable
to
our
global
position
in
peace
and
also
in
war
our
shipbuilding
program
will
sustain
a
ship
navy
in
the
s
and
we
will
continue
to
build
the
most
capable
ships
afloat
the
program
i
have
proposed
will
assure
the
ability
of
our
navy
to
operate
in
high
threat
areas
to
maintain
control
of
the
seas
and
protect
vital
lines
of
communication
both
military
and
economic
and
to
provide
the
strong
maritime
component
of
our
rapid
deployment
forces
this
is

essential
for
operations
in
remote
areas
of
the
world
where
we
cannot
predict
far
in
advance
the
precise
location
of
trouble
or
preposition
equipment
on
land
military
personnel
no
matter
how
capable
or
advanced
our
weapons
systems
our
military
security
depends
on
the
abilities
the
training
and
the
dedication
of
the
people
who
serve
in
our
armed
forces
i
am
determined
to
recruit
and
to
retain
under
any
foreseeable
circumstances
an
ample
level
of
such
skilled
and
experienced
military
personnel
this
administration
has
supported
for
fy
the
largest
peacetime
increase
ever
in
military
pay
and
allowances
we
have
enhanced
our
readiness
and
combat
endurance
by
improving
the
reserve
components
all
reservists
are
assigned
to
units
structured
to
complement
and
provide
needed
depth
to
our
active

some
reserve

have
also
now
been
equipped
with
new

we
have
completed
our
first
phase
of

the
first
such
presidentiallydirected
effort
since
world
war
ii
the
governmentwide
exercise
of
our
mobilization
plans
at
the
end
of
showed
first
that
planning
pays
off
and
second
that
much
more
needs
to
be
done
our
intelligence
posture
our
national
interests
are
critically
dependent
on
a
strong
and
effective
intelligence
capability
we
will
maintain
and
strengthen
the
intelligence
capabilities
needed
to
assure
our
national
security
maintenance
of
and
continued
improvements
in
our
multifaceted
intelligence
effort
are
essential
if
we
are
to
cope
successfully
with
the
turbulence
and
uncertainties
of
todays
world
the
intelligence
budget
i
have
submitted
to
the
congress
responds
to
our
needs
in
a
responsible
way
providing
for
significant
growth
over
the
fiscal
year
budget
this
growth
will
enable
us
to
develop
new
technical
means
of
intelligence
collection
while
also
assuring
that
the
more
traditional
methods
of
intelligence
work
are
also
given
proper
stress
we
must
continue
to
integrate
both
modes
of
collection
in
our
analyses
regional
policies
every
president
for
over
three
decades
has
recognized
that
americas
interests
are
global
and
that
we
must
pursue
a
global
foreign
policy
two
world
wars
have
made
clear
our
stake
in
western
europe
and
the
north
atlantic
area
we
are
also
inextricably
linked
with
the
far
east
politically
economically
and
militarily
in
both
of
these
the
united
states
has
a
permanent
presence
and
security
commitments
which
would
be
automatically
triggered
we
have
become
increasingly
conscious
of
our
growing
interests
in
a
third
area
the
middle
east
and
the
persian
gulf
area
we
have
vital
stakes
in
other
major
regions
of
the
world
as
well
we
have
long
recognized
that
in
an
era
of
interdependence
our
own
security
and
prosperity
depend
upon
a
larger
common
effort
with
friends
and
allies
throughout
the
world
the
atlantic
alliance
in
recognition
of
the
threat
which
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
posed
to
western
interests
in
both
europe
and
southwest
asia
nato
foreign
and
defense
ministers
have
expressed
full
support
for
us
efforts
to
develop
a
capability
to
respond
to
a
contingency
in
southwest
asia
and
have
approved
an
extensive
program
to
help
fill
the
gap
which
could
be
created
by
the
diversion
of
us
forces
to
that
region
the
us
has
not
been
alone
in
seeking
to
maintain
stability
in
the
southwest
asia
area
and
insure
access
to
the
needed
resources
there
the
european
nations
with
the
capability
to
do
so
are
improving
their
own
forces
in
the
region
and
providing
greater
economic
and
political
support
to
the
residents
of
the
area
in
the
face
of
the
potential
danger
posed
by
the
iraniraq
conflict
we
have
developed
coordination
among
the
western
forces
in
the
area
of
the
persian
gulf
in
order
to
be
able
to
safeguard
passage
in
that
essential
waterway
concerning
developments
in
and
around
poland
the
allies
have
achieved
the
highest
level
of
cohesion
and
unity
of
purpose
in
making
clear
the
effects
on
future
eastwest
relations
of
a
precipitous
soviet
act
there
the
alliance
has
continued
to
build
on
the
progress
of
the
past
three
years
in
improving
its
conventional
forces
through
the
longterm
defense
program
though
economic
conditions
throughout
europe
today
are
making
its
achievement
difficult
the
yearly
real
increase
of
percent
in
defense
spending
remains
a
goal
actively
sought
by
the
alliance
the
nato
alliance
also
has
moved
forward
during
the
past
year
with
the
implementation
of
its
historic
december
decision
to
modernize
its
theater
nuclear
force
capabilities
through
deployment
of
improved
pershing
ballistic
missiles
and
groundlaunched
cruise
missiles
in
europe
our
allies
continue
to
cooperate
actively
with
us
in
this
important
joint
endeavor
whose
purpose
is
to
demonstrate
convincingly
to
the
soviet
union
the
potential
costs
of
a
nuclear
conflict
in
europe
at
the
same
time
we
offered
convincing
evidence
of
our
commitment
to
arms
control
in
europe
by
initiating
preliminary
consultations
with
the
soviet
union
in
geneva
on
the
subject
of
negotiated
limits
on
longrange
theater
nuclear
forces
also
during
we
initiated
and
carried
out
a
withdrawal
from
our
nuclear
weapons
stockpile
in
europe
of
nuclear
warheads
this
successful
drawdown
in
our
nuclear
stockpile
was
a
further
tangible
demonstration
of
our
commitment
to
the
updating
of
our
existing
theater
nuclear
forces
in
europe
in
the
nato
area
we
continued
to
work
closely
with
other
countries
in
providing
resources
to
help
turkey
regain
economic
health
we
regretted
that
massive
political
and
internal
security
problems
led
the
turkish
military
to
take
over
the
government
on
september
the
new
turkish
authorities
are
making
some
progress
in
resolving
those
problems
and
they
have
pledged
an
early
return
to
civilian
government
the
tradition
of
the
turkish
military
gives
us
cause
to
take
that
pledge
seriously
we
welcomed
the
reestablishment
of
greeces
links
to
the
integrated
military
command
structure
of
the

move
which
we
had
strongly
encouragedas
a
major
step
toward
strengthening
natos
vital
southern
flank
at
a
time
of
international
crisis
and
tension
in
adjacent
areas
greek
reintegration
exemplifies
the
importance
which
the
allies
place
on
cooperating
in
the
common
defense
and
shows
that
the
allies
can
make
the
difficult
decisions
necessary
to
insure
their
continued
security
we
also
welcomed
the
resumption
of
the
intercommunal
talks
on

a

as
important

our

is
as
great
as

exemplified
by
a

by
regular

have
worked
vigorously
with

are
in

enter

based
on

appropriate
to

to

the

the
continuing
soviet
occupation
of
afghanistan
and
the
dislocations
caused
by
the

serve
as
constant
reminders
of
the
critical
importance
for
us
and
our
allies
of
a
third
strateg
ic
zone
stretching
across
the
middle

the
persian

and
much
of
the

this
southwest
asian
region
has
served
as
a
key
strategic
and
commercial
link
between
east
and
west
over
the
centuries
today
it
produces
twothirds
of
the

continuous

internal
instabilities
in

combined
with
very
rapid
economic
and

remains
in

of

of
these

ignoring

opinion
which

we
have
taken

remain
a
central
goal
of
our
foreign
policy
pursuant
to

egypt

have
made
steady
progress
in
the
normalization
of
their
relations
in
a
variety
of
fields
bringing
the
benefits
of
peace
directly
to
their

the
new
relationship
between
egypt
and
israel
stands
as
an
example
of
peaceful
cooperation
in
an
increasingly
fragmented

turbulent
region
both

minister
begin
remain
committed
to
the
current
negotiations
to
provide
full
autonomy
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
west

and
gaza
these
negotiations
have
been
complex
and
difficult
but
they
have
already
made
significant
progress
and
it
is
vital
that
the
two
sides
with
our
assistance
see
the
process
through
to
a
successful
conclusion
we
also
recognize
the
need
to
broaden
the
peace
process
to
include
other
parties
to
the
conflict
and
believe
that
a
successful
autonomy
agreement
is
an
essential
first
step
toward
this
objective
we
have
also
taken
a
number
of
steps
to
strengthen
our
bilateral
relations
with
both
israel
and
egypt
we
share
important
strategic
interests
with
both
of
these
countries
we
remain
committed
to
israels
security
and
are
prepared
to
take
concrete
steps
to
support
israel
whenever
that
security
is
threatened
persian
gulf
the
persian
gulf
has
been
a
vital
crossroads
for
trade
between
europe
and
asia
at
many
key
moments
in
history
it
has
become
essential
in
recent
years
for
its
supply
of
oil
to
the
united
states
our
allies
and
our
friends
we
have
taken
effective
measures
to
control
our
own
consumption
of
imported
fuel
working
in
cooperation
with
the
other
key
industrial
nations
of
the
world
however
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
healthy
growth
of
our
american
and
world
economies
will
depend
for
many
years
on
continued
safe
access
to
the
persian
gulfs
oil
production
the
denial
of
these
oil
supplies
would
threaten
not
only
our
own
but
world
security
the
potent
new
threat
from
an
advancing
soviet
union
against
the
background
of
regional
instability
of
which
it
can
take
advantage
requires
that
we
reinforce
our
ability
to
defend
our
regional
friends
and
to
protect
the
flow
of
oil
we
are
continuing
to
build
on
the
strong
political
economic
social
and
humanitarian
ties
which
bind
this
government
and
the
american
people
to
friendly
governments
and
peoples
of
the
persian
gulf
we
have
also
embarked
on
a
course
to
reinforce
the
trust
and
confidence
our
regional
friends
have
in
our
ability
to
come
to
their
assistance
rapidly
with
american
military
force
if
needed
we
have
increased
our
naval
presence
in
the
indian
ocean
we
have
created
a
rapid
deployment
force
which
can
move
quickly
to
the
gulfor
indeed
any
other
area
of
the
world
where
outside
aggression
threatens
we
have
concluded
several
agreements
with
countries
which
are
prepared
to
let
us
use
their
airports
and
naval
facilities
in
an
emergency
we
have
met
requests
for
reasonable
amounts
of
american
weaponry
from
regional
countries
which
are
anxious
to
defend
themselves
and
we
are
discussing
with
a
number
of
our
area
friends
further
ways
we
can
help
to
improve
their
security
and
ours
both
for
the
short
and
the
longer
term
south
asia
we
seek
a
south
asia
comprising
sovereign
and
stable
states
free
of
outside
interference
which
can
strengthen
their
political
institutions
according
to
their
own
national
genius
and
can
develop
their
economies
for
the
betterment
of
their
people
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
has
posed
a
new
challenge
to
this
region
and
particularly
to
neighboring
pakistan
we
are
engaged
in
a
continuing
dialogue
with
the
pakistan
government
concerning
its
development
and
security
requirements
and
the
economic
burden
imposed
by
afghan
refugees
who
have
fled
to
pakistan
we
are
participating
with
other
aid
consortium
members
in
debt
rescheduling
and
will
continue
to
cooperate
through
the
unhcr
in
providing
refugee
assistance
we
remain
committed
to
pakistans
territorial
integrity
and
independence
developments
in
the
broad
southsouthwest
asian
region
have
also
lent
a
new
importance
to
our
relations
with
india
the
largest
and
strongest
power
in
the
area
we
share
indias
interest
in
a
more
constructive
relationship
indian
policies
and
perceptions
at
times
differ
from
our
own
and
we
have
established
a
candid
dialogue
with
this
sister
democracy
which
seeks
to
avoid
the
misunderstandings
which
have
sometimes
complicated
our
ties
we
attach
major
importance
to
strong
economic
assistance
programs
to
the
countries
in
the
area
which
include
a
majority
of
the
poor
of
the
noncommunist
world
we
believe
that
these
programs
will
help
achieve
stability
in
the
area
an
objective
we
share
with
the
countries
in
the
region
great
progress
has
been
achieved
by
these
countries
in
increasing
food
production
international
cooperation
in
harnessing
the
great
river
resources
of
south
asia
would
contribute
further
to
this
goal
and
help
to
increase
energy
production
we
continue
to
give
high
priority
to
our
nonproliferation
goals
in
the
area
in
the
context
of
our
broad
global
and
regional
priorities
the
decision
to
continue
supply
of
nuclear
fuel
to
the
indian
tarapur
reactors
was
sensitive
to
this
effort
africa
the
united
states
has
achieved
a
new
level
of
trust
and
cooperation
with
africa
our
efforts
together
with
our
allies
to
achieve
peace
in
southern
africa
our
increased
efforts
to
help
the
poorest
countries
in
africa
to
combat
poverty
and
our
expanded
efforts
to
promote
trade
and
investment
have
led
to
growing
respect
for
the
us
and
to
cooperation
in
areas
of
vital
interest
to
the
united
states
africa
is
a
continent
of
poor
nations
for
the
most
part
it
also
contains
many
of
the
mineral
resources
vital
for
our
economy
we
have
worked
with
africa
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
cooperation
to
help
the
african
nations
solve
their
problems
of
poverty
and
to
develop
stronger
ties
between
our
private
sector
and
african
economies
our
assistance
to
africa
has
more
than
doubled
in
the
last
four
years
equally
important
we
set
in
motion
new
mechanisms
for
private
investment
and
trade
nigeria
is
the
largest
country
in
black
africa
and
the
second
largest
oil
supplier
to
the
united
states
during
this
administration
we
have
greatly
expanded
and
improved
our
relationship
with
nigeria
and
other
west
african
states
whose
aspirations
for
a
constitutional
democratic
order
we
share
and
support
this
interest
was
manifested
both
symbolically
and
practically
by
the
visit
of
vice
president
mondale
to
west
africa
in
july
and
the
successful
visit
to
washington
of
the
president
of
nigeria
in
october
during
vice
president
mondales
visit
a
joint
agricultural
consultative
committee
was
established
with
the
us
represented
entirely
by
the
private
sector
this
could
herald
a
new
role
for
the
american
private
sector
in
helping
solve
the
worlds
serious
food
shortages
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
our
relations
with
nigeria
are
at
an
alltime
high
providing
the
foundation
for
an
even
stronger
relationship
in
the
years
ahead
another
tenet
of
this
administrations
approach
to
african
problems
has
been
encouragement
and
support
for
regional
solutions
to
africas
problems
we
have
supported
initiatives
by
the
organization
of
african
unity
to
solve
the
protracted
conflict
in
the
western
sahara
chad
and
the
horn
in
chad
the
world
is
watching
with
dismay
as
a
country
torn
by
a
devastating
civil
war
has
become
a
fertile
field
for
libyas
exploitation
thus
demonstrating
that
threats
to
peace
can
come
from
forces
within
as
well
as
without
africa
in
southern
africa
the
united
states
continues
to
pursue
a
policy
of
encouraging
peaceful
development
toward
majority
rule
in
southern
rhodesia
became
independent
as
zimbabwe
a
multiracial
nation
under
a
system
of
majority
rule
zimbabwean
independence
last
april
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
struggle
within
the
country
and
diplomatic
efforts
involving
great
britain
african
states
neighboring
zimbabwe
and
the
united
states
the
focus
of
our
efforts
in
pursuit
of
majority
rule
in
southern
africa
has
now
turned
to
namibia
negotiations
are
proceeding
among
concerned
parties
under
the
leadership
of
un
secretary
general
waldheim
this
should
lead
to
implementation
of
the
un
plan
for
selfdetermination
and
independence
for
namibia
during
if
these
negotiations
are
successfully
concluded
sixtyfive
years
of
uncertainty
over
the
status
of
the
territory
including
a
sevenyearlong
war
will
be
ended
in
response
to
our
active
concern
with
issues
of
importance
to
africans
african
states
have
cooperated
with
us
on
issues
of
importance
to
our
national
interests
african
states
voted
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
un
resolution
calling
for
release
of
the
hostages
and
for
the
un
resolution
condemning
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
two
countries
of
africa
have
signed
access
agreements
with
the
us
allowing
us
use
of
naval
and
air
facilities
in
the
indian
ocean
africans
have
become
increasingly
vocal
on
human
rights
african
leaders
have
spoken
out
on
the
issue
of
political
prisoners
and
the
oau
is
drafting
its
own
charter
on
human
rights
three
countries
in
africa
nigeria
ghana
and
ugandahave
returned
to
civilian
rule
du
ring
the
past
year
us
cooperation
with
africa
on
all
these
matters
represents
a
strong
base
on
which
we
can
build
in
future
years
liberia
is
a
country
of
longstanding
ties
with
the
us
and
the
site
of
considerable
us
investment
and
facilities
this
past
april
a
coup
replaced
the
government
and
a
period
of
political
and
economic
uncertainty
ensued
the
us
acted
swiftly
to
meet
this
situation
we
together
with
african
leaders
urged
the
release
of
political
prisoners
and
many
have
been
released
we
provided
emergency
economic
assistance
to
help
avoid
economic
collapse
and
helped
to
involve
the
imf
and
the
banking
community
to
bring
about
economic
stability
and
we
have
worked
closely
with
the
new
leaders
to
maintain
liberias
strong
ties
with
the
west
and
to
protect
americas
vital
interests
north
africa
in
early
following
a
libyaninspired
commando
attack
on
a
tunisian
provincial
city
the
us
responded
promptly
to
tunisias
urgent
request
for
assistance
both
by
airlifting
needed
military
equipment
and
by
making
clear
our
longstanding
interest
in
the
security
and
integrity
of
this
friendly
country
the
us
remains
determined
to
oppose
other
irresponsible
libyan
aspirations
despairing
of
a
productive
dialogue
with
the
libyan
authorities
the
us
closed
down
its
embassy
in
libya
and
later
expelled
six
libyan
diplomats
in
washington
in
order
to
deter
an
intimidation
campaign
against
libyan
citizens
in
the
us
us
relations
with
algeria
have
improved
and
algeria
has
played
an
indispensable
and
effective
role
as
intermediary
between
iran
and
the
us
over
the
hostage
issue
the
strengthening
of
our
arms
supply
relationship
with
morocco
has
helped
to
deal
with
attacks
inside
its
internationally
recognized
frontiers
and
to
strengthen
its
confidence
in
seeking
a
political
settlement
of
the
western
sahara
conflict
while
not
assuming
a
mediatory
role
the
us
encouraged
all
interested
parties
to
turn
their
energies
to
a
peaceful
and
sensible
compromise
resolution
of
the
war
in
the
sahara
and
supported
efforts
by
the
organization
of
african
unity
toward
that
end
as
the
year
drew
to
a
close
the
us
was
encouraged
by
evolution
in
the
attitudes
of
all
sides
and
is
hopeful
that
their
differences
will
be
peacefully
resolved
in
the
year
ahead
so
that
the
vast
economic
potential
of
north
africa
can
be
developed
for
the
wellbeing
of
the
people
living
there
latin
america
and
the
caribbean
the
principles
of
our
policies
in
this
hemisphere
have
been
clear
and
constant
over
the
last
four
years
we
support
democracy
and
respect
for
human
rights
we
have
struggled
with
many
to
help
free
the
region
of
both
repression
and
terrorism
we
have
respected
ideological
diversity
and
opposed
outside
intervention
in
purely
internal
affairs
we
will
act
though
in
response
to
a
request
for
assistance
by
a
country
threatened
by
external
aggression
we
support
social
and
economic
development
within
a
democratic
framework
we
support
the
peaceful
settlement
of
disputes
we
strongly
encourage
regional
cooperation
and
shared
responsibilities
within
the
hemisphere
to
all
these
ends
and
we
have
eagerly
and
regularly
sought
the
advice
of
the
leaders
of
the
region
on
a
wide
range
of
issues
last
november
i
spoke
to
the
general
assembly
of
the
organization
of
american
states
of
a
cause
that
has
been
closest
to
my
hearthuman
rights
it
is
an
issue
that
has
found
its
time
in
the
hemisphere
the
cause
is
not
mine
alone
but
an
historic
movement
that
will
endure
at
riobamba
ecuador
last
september
four
andean
pact
countries
costa
rica
and
panama
broke
new
ground
by
adopting
a
code
of
conduct
that
joint
action
in
defense
of
human
rights
does
not
violate
the
principles
of
nonintervention
in
the
internal
affairs
of
states
in
this
hemisphere
the
organization
of
american
states
has
twice
condemned
the
coup
that
overturned
the
democratic
process
in
bolivia
and
the
widespread
abuse
of
human
rights
by
the
regime
which
seized
power
the
interamerican
commission
on
human
rights
has
gained
world
acclaim
for
its
dispassionate
reports
it
completed
two
major
country
studies
this
year
in
addition
to
its
annual
report
in
a
resolution
adopted
without
opposition
the
oas
general
assembly
in
november
strongly
supported
the
work
of
the
commission
the
american
convention
on
human
rights
is
in
force
and
an
interamerican
court
has
been
created
to
judge
human
rights
violations
this
convention
has
been
pending
before
the
senate
for
two
years
i
hope
the
united
states
this
year
will
join
the
other
nations
of
the
hemisphere
in
ratifying
a
convention
which
embodies
principles
that
are
our
tradition
the
trend
in
favor
of
democracy
has
continued
during
this
past
year
peru
inaugurated
a
democratically
elected
government
brazil
continues
its
process
of
liberalization
in
central
america
hondurans
voted
in
record
numbers
in
their
first
national
elections
in
over
eight
years
in
the
caribbean
seven
elections
have
returned
governments
firmly
committed
to
the
democratic
traditions
of
the
commonwealth
another
major
contribution
to
peace
in
the
hemisphere
is
latin
americas
own
treaty
for
the
prohibition
of
nuclear
weapons
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
i
signed
protocol
i
of
this
treaty
in
may
of
and
sent
it
to
the
senate
for
ratification
i
urge
that
it
be
acted
upon
promptly
by
the
senate
in
order
that
it
be
brought
into
the
widest
possible
effect
in
the
latin
american
region
regional
cooperation
for
development
is
gaining
from
central
america
to
the
andes
and
throughout
the
caribbean
the
caribbean
group
for
cooperation
in
economic
development
which
we
established
with
other
nations
in
has
helped
channel
million
in
external
support
for
growth
in
the
caribbean
the
recent
meeting
of
the
chiefs
of
state
of
the
eastern
caribbean
set
a
new
precedent
for
cooperation
in
that
region
mexico
and
venezuela
jointly
and
trinidad
and
tobago
separately
have
established
oil
facilities
that
will
provide
substantial
assistance
to
their
oil
importing
neighbors
the
peace
treaty
between
el
salvador
and
honduras
will
hopefully
stimulate
central
america
to
move
forward
again
toward
economic
integration
formation
of
caribbean
central
american
action
a
private
sector
organization
has
given
a
major
impetus
to
improving
peopletopeople
bonds
and
strengthening
the
role
of
private
enterprise
in
the
development
of
democratic
societies
the
panama
treaties
have
been
in
force
for
over
a
year
a
new
partnership
has
been
created
with
panama
it
is
a
model
for
large
and
small
nations
a
longstanding
issue
that
divided
us
from
our
neighbors
has
been
resolved
the
security
of
the
canal
has
been
enhanced
the
canal
is
operating
as
well
as
ever
with
traffic
through
it
reaching
record
levels
this
year
canal
employees
american
and
panamanian
alike
have
remained
on
the
job
and
have
found
their
living
and
working
conditions
virtually
unchanged
in
relations
with
mexico
continued
to
improve
due
in
large
measure
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
coordinator
for
mexican
affairs
and
the
expanded
use
of
the
usmexico
consultative
mechanism
by
holding
periodic
meetings
of
its
various
working
groups
we
have
been
able
to
prevent
mutual
concerns
from
becoming
political
issues
the
secretary
of
state
visited
mexico
city
in
november
and
along
with
the
mexican
secretary
of
foreign
relations
reviewed
the
performance
of
the
consultative
mechanism
the
office
of
the
coordinator
has
ensured
the
implementation
of
my
directive
to
all
agencies
to
accord
high
priority
to
mexican
concerns
trade
with
mexico
rose
by
almost
percent
to
nearly
billion
making
that
country
our
third
largest
trading
partner
these
are
all
encouraging
developments
other
problems
remain
however
the
impact
of
largescale
migration
is
affecting
many
countries
in
the
hemisphere
the
most
serious
manifestation
was
the
massive
illegal
exodus
from
cuba
last
summer
the
cuban
government
unilaterally
encouraged
the
disorderly
and
even
deadly
migration
of
of
its
citizens
in
complete
disregard
for
international
law
or
the
immigration
laws
of
its
neighbors
migrations
of
this
nature
clearly
require
concerted
action
and
we
have
asked
the
oas
to
explore
means
of
dealing
with
similar
situations
which
may
occur
in
the
future
we
have
a
longstanding
treaty
with
colombia
on
quita
sueno
roncador
and
serrano
which
remains
to
be
ratified
by
the
senate
in
central
america
the
future
of
nicaragua
is
unclear
recent
tensions
the
restrictions
on
the
press
and
political
activity
an
inordinate
cuban
presence
in
the
country
and
the
tragic
killing
by
the
security
forces
of
a
businessman
well
known
for
his
democratic
orientation
cause
us
considerable
concern
these
are
not
encouraging
developments
but
those
who
seek
a
free
society
remain
in
the
contest
for
their
nations
destiny
they
have
asked
us
to
help
rebuild
their
country
and
by
our
assistance
to
demonstrate
that
the
democratic
nations
do
not
intend
to
abandon
nicaragua
to
the
cubans
as
long
as
those
who
intend
to
pursue
their
pluralistic
goals
play
important
roles
in
nicaragua
it
deserves
our
continuing
support
in
el
salvador
we
have
supported
the
efforts
of
the
junta
to
change
the
fundamental
basis
of
an
inequitable
system
and
to
give
a
stake
in
a
new
nation
to
those
millions
of
people
who
for
so
long
lived
without
hope
or
dignity
as
the
government
struggles
against
those
who
would
restore
an
old
tyranny
or
impose
a
new
one
the
united
states
will
continue
to
stand
behind
them
we
have
increased
our
aid
to
the
caribbean
an
area
vital
to
our
national
security
and
we
should
continue
to
build
close
relations
based
on
mutual
respect
and
understanding
and
common
interests
as
the
nations
of
this
hemisphere
prepare
to
move
further
into
the
s
i
am
struck
by
the
depth
of
underlying
commitment
that
there
is

our

of
major

to
the

the
fabric
of
our

with
these

has
strong
economic
and
political
dimensions
they
constitute
the
most
rapidly
growing
markets
for

and
are
important
sources
of

their

are
increasingly
important
as

our

we
have
in

their

the

our

require
us
to
maintain
the
policy
of
active
involvement
with
the

that
we
have
pursued
over
the

four
years
the
actions
we
have
taken
in
such
areas
as

trade

and
international

are
all
important
to
the

of

another
important
way
the

can
directly
assist
these
countries
and
demonstrate
our
concern
for

is
through

venice
economic

that
the
major

should
increase
their
aid
for
food
and

production
and
for

we
understand
that
other

countries
plan
similar
responses
it
is
also
important
to
honor
our
international
agreements
for
multilateral
assistance
by
authorizing
and
appropriating

for
the
international

these
multilateral

enhance
the

combining

all
these

our
longrun
economic

progress
was
made
on
a
number
of
economic
issues
in
negotiations
throughout
the
un
system
however
in
spite
of
lengthy
efforts
in
the
united

agreement
has
not
been
reached
on
how
to
launch
a
process
of
global
negotiations
in
which
nations
might
collectively
work
to
solve
such
important
issues
as
energy
food
protectionism
and
population
pressures
the
united

continues
to
believe
that
progress
can
best
be
made
when
nations
focus
on
such
specific
problems
rather
than
on
procedural
and
institutional
questions
it
will
continue
to
work
to
move

the

on

must
be
a
continuous
urgent
priority
major
portions
of
the
worlds
population
continue
to
be
threatened
by
the
specter
of
hunger
and
malnutrition
during
the
past
year
some
million
people
in
african
countries
were
faced
with
near
disaster
as
the
result
of
serious
dro
ught
induced
food
shortages
our
government
working
in
concert
with
the
uns
food
and
agricultural
organization
fao
helped
to
respond
to
that
need
but
the
problems
of
hunger
cannot
be
solved
by
shortterm
measures
we
must
continue
to
support
those
activities
bilateral
and
multilateral
which
aim
at
improving
food
production
especially
in
developing
countries
and
assuring
global

these
measures
are
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
a
stable
and
healthy

economy
i
am
pleased
that
negotiation
of
a
new
food
aid
convention
which
guarantees
a
minimum
annual
level
of
food

was
successfully
concluded
in

the

will
enable
the
us
to
meet
its
commitment
under
the
new
convention
to
feed
hungry
people
even
in
times
of
short
supply
of
immediate
concern
is
the
prospect
of
millions
of
africans
threatened
by
famine
because
of
drought
and
civil
disturbances
the
us
plea
for
increased
food
aid
resulted
in
the
organization
of
an
international
pledging
conference
and
we
are
hopeful
that
widespread
starvation
will
be
avoided
good

on

we
and
other

have
begun
to
assist
poor

develop
longterm
strategies
to
improve
their
food

the

will
invest
up
to

in
the
next
few
years
in
improving
the
grain
storage
and

capacity
of

prone
to

good
progress
has
been
made
since
the
tokyo
economic

called
for

on
this

the
world

is
giving
this
problem
top
priority
as
are
some
other
donor
countries
the
resources
of
the
consultative

on

agricultural
research
will
be
doubled
over
a
fiveyear
period
the
work
of
our

will
further
strengthen
the
search
for
relevant
new
agricultural
technologies
the
goal
of
freeing
the

by

the
human

policy
of
the

has
been
an
integral
part
of
our
overall
foreign
policy
for
the
past
several
years
this
policy
serves
the
national
interest
of
the
united
states
in
several
important
ways
by
encouraging
respect
by
governments
for
the
basic
rights
of
human
beings
it
promotes
peaceful
constructive
change
reduces
the
likelihood
of
internal
pressures
for
violent
change
and
for
the
exploitation
of
these
by
our
adversaries
and
thus
directly
serves
our
longterm
interest
in
peace
and
stability
by
matching
espousal
of
fundamental
american
principles
of
freedom
with
specific
foreign
policy
actions
we
stand
out
in
vivid
contrast
to
our
ideological
adversaries
by
our
efforts
to
expand
freedom
elsewhere
we
render
our
own
freedom
and
our
own
nation
more
secure
countries
that
respect
human

make
stronger

and
better

rather
than
attempt
to
dictate
what

other

should
have
the
us
supports
throughout
the
world
the
internationally
recognized
human

which
all
members
of
the
united

have
pledged
themselves
to
respect
there
is
more
than
one
model
that
can
satisfy
the
continuing
human
reach
for
freedom
and
justice
has
been
a
year
of
some
disappointments
but
has
also
seen
some
positive
developments
in
the
ongoing
struggle
for
fulfillment
of

throughout

in
the

the

of

cannot
take
credit
for
all
these
various
developments
but
we
can
take
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
our

encourage
and
perhaps
influence
them
those
who
see
a
contradiction
between
our

and
our

that
the
basis
for
a
secure

stable
society
is
the
bond
of
trust
between
a
government
and
its
people
i
profoundly
believe
that
the
future
of
our
world
is
not
to
be
found
in
authoritarianism
that
wears
the
mask
of
order
or
totalitarianism
that
wears
the
mask
of

instead
let
us
find
our

the

one
factor
in

has
been
the

relief
efforts
to
aid
refugees
in
countries
of
first
asylum
continued
in
several
areas
of
the
world
in
december
thirtytwo
nations
meeting
in
new
york
city
agreed
to
contribute
million
to
the
continuing
famine
relief
program
in
kampuchea
due
in
great
part
to
the
generosity
of
the
american
people
and
the
leadership
exercised
in
the
international
arena
by
the
united
states
we
have
played
the
pivotal
role
in
ameliorating
massive
suffering
in
kampuchea
the
united
states
has
taken
the
lead
among
a
group
of
donor
countries
who
are
providing
relief
to
some
two
million
refugees
in
the
horn
of
africa
who
have
been
displaced
by
fighting
in
ethiopia
us
assistance
primarily
to
somalia
consists
of
million
worth
of
food
and
million
in
cash
and
kind
here
again
united
states
efforts
can
in
large
part
be
credited
with
keeping
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
alive
another
major
international
relief
effort
has
been
mounted
in
pakistan
the
united
states
is
one
of
countries
plus
the
european
economic
community
who
have
been
helping
the
government
of
pakistan
to
cope
with
the
problem
of
feeding
and
sheltering
the
more
than
one
million
refugees
that
have
been
generated
by
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
in
april
the
congress
passed
the
refugee
act
of
which
brought
together
for
the
first
time
in
one
piece
of
legislation
the
various
threads
of
us
policy
towards
refugees
the
law
laid
down
a
new
broader
definition
of
the
term
refugee
established
mechanisms
for
arriving
at
a
level
of
refugee
admissions
through
consultation
with
congress
and
established
the
office
of
the
united
states
coordinator
for
refugees
it
cannot
be
ignored
that
the
destructive
and
aggressive
policies
of
the
soviet
union
have
added
immeasurably
to
the
suffering
in
these
three
tragic
situations
the
control
of
nuclear
weapons
together
with
our
friends
and
allies
we
are
striving
to
build
a
world
in
which
peoples
with
diverse
interests
can
live
freely
and
prosper
but
all
that
humankind
has
achieved
to
date
all
that
we
are
seeking
to
accomplish
and
human
existence
itself
can
be
undone
in
an
instantin
the
catastrophe
of
a
nuclear
war
thus
one
of
the
central
objectives
of
my
administration
has
been
to
control
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons
to
those
nations
which
do
not
have
them
and
their
further
development
by
the
existing
nuclear
powers
notably
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
nonproliferation
my
administration
has
been
committed
to
stemming
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
nuclear
proliferation
would
raise
the
spectre
of
the
use
of
nuclear
explosives
in
crucial
unstable
regions
of
the
world
endangering
not
only
our
security
and
that
of
our
allies
but
that
of
the
whole
world
nonproliferation
is
not
and
can
not
be
a
unilateral
us
policy
nor
should
it
be
an
issue
of
contention
between
the
industrialized
and
developing
states
the
international
nonproliferation
effort
requires
the
support
of
suppliers
as
well
as
importers
of
nuclear
technology
and
materials
we
have
been
proceeding
on
a
number
of
fronts
first
we
have
been
seeking
to
encourage
nations
to
accede
to
the
nonproliferation
trea
ty
the
us
is
also
actively
encouraging
other
nations
to
accept
fullscope
safeguards
on
all
of
their
nuclear
activities
and
is
asking
other
nuclear
suppliers
to
adopt
a
fullscope
safeguards
requirement
as
a
condition
for
future
supply
second
the
international
nuclear
fuel
cycle
evaluation
infce
which
was
completed
in
demonstrated
that
suppliers
and
recipients
can
work
together
on
these
technically
complex
and
sensitive
issues
while
differences
remain
the
infce
effort
provides
a
broader
international
basis
for
national
decisions
which
must
balance
energy
needs
with
nonproliferation
concerns
finally
we
are
working
to
encourage
regional
cooperation
and
restraint
protocol
i
of
the
treaty
of
tlatelolco
which
will
contribute
to
the
lessening
of
nuclear
dangers
for
our
latin
american
neighbors
ought
now
to
be
ratified
by
the
united
states
senate
limitations
on
strategic
arms
i
remain
convinced
that
the
salt
ii
treaty
is
in
our
nations
security
interest
and
that
it
would
add
significantly
to
the
control
of
nuclear
weapons
i
strongly
support
continuation
of
the
salt
process
and
the
negotiation
of
more
farreaching
mutual
restraints
on
nuclear
weaponry
conclusion
we
have
new
support
in
the
world
for
our
purposes
of
national
independence
and
individual
human
dignity
we
have
a
new
will
at
home
to
do
what
is
required
to
keep
us
the
strongest
nation
on
earth
we
must
move
together
into
this
decade
with
the
strength
which
comes
from
realization
of
the
dangers
before
us
and
from
the
confidence
that
together
we
can
overcome
them
the
white
house
january

this
last
few
months
has
not
been
an
easy
time
for
any
of
us
as
we
meet
tonight
it
has
never
been
more
clear
that
the
state
of
our
union
depends
on
the
state
of
the
world
and
tonight
as
throughout
our
own
generation
freedom
and
peace
in
the
world
depend
on
the
state
of
our
union
the
s
have
been
born
in
turmoil
strife
and
change
this
is
a
time
of
challenge
to
our
interests
and
our
values
and
its
a
time
that
tests
our
wisdom
and
our
skills
at
this
time
in
iran
americans
are
still
held
captive
innocent
victims
of
terrorism
and
anarchy
also
at
this
moment
massive
soviet
troops
are
attempting
to
subjugate
the
fiercely
independent
and
deeply
religious
people
of
afghanistan
these
two
actsone
of
international
terrorism
and
one
of
military
aggressionpresent
a
serious
challenge
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
indeed
to
all
the
nations
of
the
world
together
we
will
meet
these
threats
to
peace
im
determined
that
the
united
states
will
remain
the
strongest
of
all
nations
but
our
power
will
never
be
used
to
initiate
a
threat
to
the
security
of
any
nation
or
to
the
rights
of
any
human
being
we
seek
to
be
and
to
remain
securea
nation
at
peace
in
a
stable
world
but
to
be
secure
we
must
face
the
world
as
it
is
three
basic
developments
have
helped
to
shape
our
challenges
the
steady
growth
and
increased
projection
of
soviet
military
power
beyond
its
own
borders
the
overwhelming
dependence
of
the
western
democracies
on
oil
supplies
from
the
middle
east
and
the
press
of
social
and
religious
and
economic
and
political
change
in
the
many
nations
of
the
developing
world
exemplified
by
the
revolution
in
iran
each
of
these
factors
is
important
in
its
own
right
each
interacts
with
the
others
all
must
be
faced
together
squarely
and
courageously
we
will
face
these
challenges
and
we
will
meet
them
with
the
best
that
is
in
us
and
we
will
not
fail
in
response
to
the
abhorrent
act
in
iran
our
nation
has
never
been
aroused
and
unified
so
greatly
in
peacetime
our
position
is
clear
the
united
states
will
not
yield
to
blackmail
we
continue
to
pursue
these
specific
goals
first
to
protect
the
present
and
longrange
interests
of
the
united
states
secondly
to
preserve
the
lives
of
the
american
hostages
and
to
secure
as
quickly
as
possible
their
safe
release
if
possible
to
avoid
bloodshed
which
might
further
endanger
the
lives
of
our
fellow
citizens
to
enlist
the
help
of
other
nations
in
condemning
this
act
of
violence
which
is
shocking
and
violates
the
moral
and
the
legal
standards
of
a
civilized
world
and
also
to
convince
and
to
persuade
the
iranian
leaders
that
the
real
danger
to
their
nation
lies
in
the
north
in
the
soviet
union
and
from
the
soviet
troops
now
in
afghanistan
and
that
the
unwarranted
iranian
quarrel
with
the
united
states
hampers
their
response
to
this
far
greater
danger
to
them
if
the
american
hostages
are
harmed
a
severe
price
will
be
paid
we
will
never
rest
until
every
one
of
the
american
hostages
are
released
but
now
we
face
a
broader
and
more
fundamental
challenge
in
this
region
because
of
the
recent
military
action
of
the
soviet
union
now
as
during
the
last
decades
the
relationship
between
our
country
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
soviet
union
is
the
most
critical
factor
in
determining
whether
the
world
will
live
at
peace
or
be
engulfed
in
global
conflict
since
the
end
of
the
second
world
war
america
has
led
other
nations
in
meeting
the
challenge
of
mounting
soviet
power
this
has
not
been
a
simple
or
a
static
relationship
between
us
there
has
been
cooperation
there
has
been
competition
and
at
times
there
has
been
confrontation
in
the
s
we
took
the
lead
in
creating
the
atlantic
alliance
in
response
to
the
soviet
unions
suppression
and
then
consolidation
of
its
east
european
empire
and
the
resulting
threat
of
the
warsaw
pact
to
western
europe
in
the
s
we
helped
to
contain
further
soviet
challenges
in
korea
and
in
the
middle
east
and
we
rearmed
to
assure
the
continuation
of
that
containment
in
the
s
we
met
the
soviet
challenges
in
berlin
and
we
faced
the
cuban
missile
crisis
and
we
sought
to
engage
the
soviet
union
in
the
important
task
of
moving
beyond
the
cold
war
and
away
from
confrontation
and
in
the
s
three
american
presidents
negotiated
with
the
soviet
leaders
in
attempts
to
halt
the
growth
of
the
nuclear
arms
race
we
sought
to
establish
rules
of
behavior
that
would
reduce
the
risks
of
conflict
and
we
searched
for
areas
of
cooperation
that
could
make
our
relations
reciprocal
and
productive
not
only
for
the
sake
of
our
two
nations
but
for
the
security
and
peace
of
the
entire
world
in
all
these
actions
we
have
maintained
two
commitments
to
be
ready
to
meet
any
challenge
by
soviet
military
power
and
to
develop
ways
to
resolve
disputes
and
to
keep
the
peace
preventing
nuclear
war
is
the
foremost
responsibility
of
the
two
superpowers
thats
why
weve
negotiated
the
strategic
arms
limitation
treatiessalt
i
and
salt
ii
especially
now
in
a
time
of
great
tension
observing
the
mutual
constraints
imposed
by
the
terms
of
these
treaties
will
be
in
the
best
interest
of
both
countries
and
will
help
to
preserve
world
peace
i
will
consult
very
closely
with
the
congress
on
this
matter
as
we
strive
to
control
nuclear
weapons
that
effort
to
control
nuclear
weapons
will
not
be
abandoned
we
superpowers
also
have
the
responsibility
to
exercise
restraint
in
the
use
of
our
great
military
force
the
integrity
and
the
independence
of
weaker
nations
must
not
be
threatened
they
must
know
that
in
our
presence
they
are
secure
but
now
the
soviet
union
has
taken
a
radical
and
an
aggressive
new
step
its
using
its
great
military
power
against
a
relatively
defenseless
nation
the
implications
of
the
soviet
invasion
of
afghanistan
could
pose
the
most
serious
threat
to
the
peace
since
the
second
world
war
the
vast
majority
of
nations
on
earth
have
condemned
this
latest
soviet
attempt
to
extend
its
colonial
domination
of
others
and
have
demanded
the
immediate
withdrawal
of
soviet
troops
the
moslem
world
is
especially
and
justifiably
outraged
by
this
aggression
against
an
islamic
people
no
action
of
a
world
power
has
ever
been
so
quickly
and
so
overwhelmingly
condemned
but
verbal
condemnation
is
not
enough
the
soviet
union
must
pay
a
concrete
price
for
their
aggression
while
this
invasion
continues
we
and
the
other
nations
of
the
world
cannot
conduct
business
as
usual
with
the
soviet
union
thats
why
the
united
states
has
imposed
stiff
economic
penalties
on
the
soviet
union
i
will
not
issue
any
permits
for
soviet
ships
to
fish
in
the
coastal
waters
of
the
united
states
ive
cut
soviet
access
to
hightechnology
equipment
and
to
agricultural
products
ive
limited
other
commerce
with
the
soviet
union
and
ive
asked
our
allies
and
friends
to
join
with
us
in
restraining
their
own
trade
with
the
soviets
and
not
to
replace
our
own
embargoed
items
and
i
have
notified
the
olympic
committee
that
with
soviet
invading
forces
in
afghanistan
neither
the
american
people
nor
i
will
support
sending
an
olympic
team
to
moscow
the
soviet
union
is
going
to
have
to
answer
some
basic
questions
will
it
help
promote
a
more
stable
international
environment
in
which
its
own
legitimate
peaceful
concerns
can
be
pursued
or
will
it
continue
to
expand
its
military
power
far
beyond
its
genuine
security
needs
and
use
that
power
for
colonial
conquest
the
soviet
union
must
realize
that
its
decision
to
use
military
force
in
afghanistan
will
be
costly
to
every
political
and
economic
relationship
it
values
the
region
which
is
now
threatened
by
soviet
troops
in
afghanistan
is
of
great
strategic
importance
it
contains
more
than
twothirds
of
the
worlds
exportable
oil
the
soviet
effort
to
dominate
afghanistan
has
brought
soviet
military
forces
to
within
miles
of
the
indian
ocean
and
close
to
the
straits
of
hormuz
a
waterway
through
which
most
of
the
worlds
oil
must
flow
the
soviet
union
is
now
attempting
to
consolidate
a
strategic
position
therefore
that
poses
a
grave
threat
to
the
free
movement
of
middle
east
oil
this
situation
demands
careful
thought
steady
nerves
and
resolute
action
not
only
for
this
year
but
for
many
years
to
come
it
demands
collective
efforts
to
meet
this
new
threat
to
security
in
the
persian
gulf
and
in
southwest
asia
it
demands
the
participation
of
all
those
who
rely
on
oil
from
the
middle
east
and
who
are
concerned
with
global
peace
and
stability
and
it
demands
consultation
and
close
cooperation
with
countries
in
the
area
which
might
be
threatened
meeting
this
challenge
will
take
national
will
diplomatic
and
political
wisdom
economic
sacrifice
and
of
course
military
capability
we
must
call
on
the
best
that
is
in
us
to
preserve
the
security
of
this
crucial
region
let
our
position
be
absolutely
clear
an
attempt
by
any
outside
force
to
gain
control
of
the
persian
gulf
region
will
be
regarded
as
an
assault
on
the
vital
interests
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
such
an
assault
will
be
repelled
by
any
means
necessary
including
military
force
during
the
past
years
you
have
joined
with
me
to
improve
our
own
security
and
the
prospects
for
peace
not
only
in
the
vital
oilproducing
area
of
the
persian
gulf
region
but
around
the
world
weve
increased
annually
our
real
commitment
for
defense
and
we
will
sustain
this
increase
of
effort
throughout
the
five
year
defense
program
its
imperative
that
congress
approve
this
strong
defense
budget
for
encompassing
a
percent
real
growth
in
authorizations
without
any
reduction
we
are
also
improving
our
capability
to
deploy
us
military
forces
rapidly
to
distant
areas
weve
helped
to
strengthen
nato
and
our
other
alliances
and
recently
we
and
other
nato
members
have
decided
to
develop
and
to
deploy
modernized
intermediaterange
nuclear
forces
to
meet
an
unwarranted
and
increased
threat
from
the
nuclear
weapons
of
the
soviet
union
we
are
working
with
our
allies
to
prevent
conflict
in
the
middle
east
the
peace
treaty
between
egypt
and
israel
is
a
notable
achievement
which
represents
a
strategic
asset
for
america
and
which
also
enhances
prospects
for
regiona
l
and
world
peace
we
are
now
engaged
in
further
negotiations
to
provide
full
autonomy
for
the
people
of
the
west
bank
and
gaza
to
resolve
the
palestinian
issue
in
all
its
aspects
and
to
preserve
the
peace
and
security
of
israel
let
no
one
doubt
our
commitment
to
the
security
of
israel
in
a
few
days
we
will
observe
an
historic
event
when
israel
makes
another
major
withdrawal
from
the
sinai
and
when
ambassadors
will
be
exchanged
between
israel
and
egypt
weve
also
expanded
our
own
sphere
of
friendship
our
deep
commitment
to
human
rights
and
to
meeting
human
needs
has
improved
our
relationship
with
much
of
the
third
world
our
decision
to
normalize
relations
with
the
peoples
republic
of
china
will
help
to
preserve
peace
and
stability
in
asia
and
in
the
western
pacific
weve
increased
and
strengthened
our
naval
presence
in
the
indian
ocean
and
we
are
now
making
arrangements
for
key
naval
and
air
facilities
to
be
used
by
our
forces
in
the
region
of
northeast
africa
and
the
persian
gulf
weve
reconfirmed
our
agreement
to
help
pakistan
preserve
its
independence
and
its
integrity
the
united
states
will
take
action
consistent
with
our
own
laws
to
assist
pakistan
in
resisting
any
outside
aggression
and
im
asking
the
congress
specifically
to
reaffirm
this
agreement
im
also
working
along
with
the
leaders
of
other
nations
to
provide
additional
military
and
economic
aid
for
pakistan
that
request
will
come
to
you
in
just
a
few
days
finally
we
are
prepared
to
work
with
other
countries
in
the
region
to
share
a
cooperative
security
framework
that
respects
differing
values
and
political
beliefs
yet
which
enhances
the
independence
security
and
prosperity
of
all
all
these
efforts
combined
emphasize
our
dedication
to
defend
and
preserve
the
vital
interests
of
the
region
and
of
the
nation
which
we
represent
and
those
of
our
alliesin
europe
and
the
pacific
and
also
in
the
parts
of
the
world
which
have
such
great
strategic
importance
to
us
stretching
especially
through
the
middle
east
and
southwest
asia
with
your
help
i
will
pursue
these
efforts
with
vigor
and
with
determination
you
and
i
will
act
as
necessary
to
protect
and
to
preserve
our
nations
security
the
men
and
women
of
americas
armed
forces
are
on
duty
tonight
in
many
parts
of
the
world
im
proud
of
the
job
they
are
doing
and
i
know
you
share
that
pride
i
believe
that
our
volunteer
forces
are
adequate
for
current
defense
needs
and
i
hope
that
it
will
not
become
necessary
to
impose
a
draft
however
we
must
be
prepared
for
that
possibility
for
this
reason
i
have
determined
that
the
selective
service
system
must
now
be
revitalized
i
will
send
legislation
and
budget
proposals
to
the
congress
next
month
so
that
we
can
begin
registration
and
then
meet
future
mobilization
needs
rapidly
if
they
arise
we
also
need
clear
and
quick
passage
of
a
new
charter
to
define
the
legal
authority
and
accountability
of
our
intelligence
agencies
we
will
guarantee
that
abuses
do
not
recur
but
we
must
tighten
our
controls
on
sensitive
intelligence
information
and
we
need
to
remove
unwarranted
restraints
on
americas
ability
to
collect
intelligence
the
decade
ahead
will
be
a
time
of
rapid
change
as
nations
everywhere
seek
to
deal
with
new
problems
and
ageold
tensions
but
america
need
have
no
fear
we
can
thrive
in
a
world
of
change
if
we
remain
true
to
our
values
and
actively
engaged
in
promoting
world
peace
we
will
continue
to
work
as
we
have
for
peace
in
the
middle
east
and
southern
africa
we
will
continue
to
build
our
ties
with
developing
nations
respecting
and
helping
to
strengthen
their
national
independence
which
they
have
struggled
so
hard
to
achieve
and
we
will
continue
to
support
the
growth
of
democracy
and
the
protection
of
human
rights
in
repressive
regimes
popular
frustrations
often
have
no
outlet
except
through
violence
but
when
peoples
and
their
governments
can
approach
their
problems
together
through
open
democratic
methods
the
basis
for
stability
and
peace
is
far
more
solid
and
far
more
enduring
that
is
why
our
support
for
human
rights
in
other
countries
is
in
our
own
national
interest
as
well
as
part
of
our
own
national
character
peacea
peace
that
preserves
freedomremains
americas
first
goal
in
the
coming
years
as
a
mighty
nation
we
will
continue
to
pursue
peace
but
to
be
strong
abroad
we
must
be
strong
at
home
and
in
order
to
be
strong
we
must
continue
to
face
up
to
the
difficult
issues
that
confront
us
as
a
nation
today
the
crises
in
iran
and
afghanistan
have
dramatized
a
very
important
lesson
our
excessive
dependence
on
foreign
oil
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
our
nations
security
the
need
has
never
been
more
urgent
at
long
last
we
must
have
a
clear
comprehensive
energy
policy
for
the
united
states
as
you
well
know
i
have
been
working
with
the
congress
in
a
concentrated
and
persistent
way
over
the
past
years
to
meet
this
need
we
have
made
progress
together
but
congress
must
act
promptly
now
to
complete
final
action
on
this
vital
energy
legislation
our
nation
will
then
have
a
major
conservation
effort
important
initiatives
to
develop
solar
power
realistic
pricing
based
on
the
true
value
of
oil
strong
incentives
for
the
production
of
coal
and
other
fossil
fuels
in
the
united
states
and
our
nations
most
massive
peacetime
investment
in
the
development
of
synthetic
fuels
the
american
people
are
making
progress
in
energy
conservation
last
year
we
reduced
overall
petroleum
consumption
by
percent
and
gasoline
consumption
by
percent
below
what
it
was
the
year
before
now
we
must
do
more
after
consultation
with
the
governors
we
will
set
gasoline
conservation
goals
for
each
of
the
states
and
i
will
make
them
mandatory
if
these
goals
are
not
met
ive
established
an
import
ceiling
for
of
million
barrels
a
daywell
below
the
level
of
foreign
oil
purchases
in
i
expect
our
imports
to
be
much
lower
than
this
but
the
ceiling
will
be
enforced
by
an
oil
import
fee
if
necessary
im
prepared
to
lower
these
imports
still
further
if
the
other
oilconsuming
countries
will
join
us
in
a
fair
and
mutual
reduction
if
we
have
a
serious
shortage
i
will
not
hesitate
to
impose
mandatory
gasoline
rationing
immediately
the
single
biggest
factor
in
the
inflation
rate
last
year
the
increase
in
the
inflation
rate
last
year
was
from
one
cause
the
skyrocketing
prices
of
opec
oil
we
must
take
whatever
actions
are
necessary
to
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oiland
at
the
same
time
reduce
inflation
as
individuals
and
as
families
few
of
us
can
produce
energy
by
ourselves
but
all
of
us
can
conserve
energyevery
one
of
us
every
day
of
our
lives
tonight
i
call
on
youin
fact
all
the
people
of
americato
help
our
nation
conserve
energy
eliminate
waste
make
indeed
a
year
of
energy
conservation
of
course
we
must
take
other
actions
to
strengthen
our
nations
economy
first
we
will
continue
to
reduce
the
deficit
and
then
to
balance
the
federal
budget
second
as
we
continue
to
work
with
business
to
hold
down
prices
well
build
also
on
the
historic
national
accord
with
organized
labor
to
restrain
pay
increases
in
a
fair
fight
against
inflation
third
we
will
continue
our
successful
efforts
to
cut
paperwork
and
to
dismantle
unnecessary
government
regulation
fourth
we
will
continue
our
progress
in
providing
jobs
for
america
concentrating
on
a
major
new
program
to
provide
training
and
work
for
our
young
people
especially
minority
youth
it
has
been
said
that
a
mind
is
a
terrible
thing
to
waste
we
will
give
our
young
people
new
hope
for
jobs
and
a
better
life
in
the
s
and
fifth
we
must
use
the
decade
of
the
s
to
attack
the
basic
structural
weaknesses
and
problems
in
our
economy
through
measures
to
increase
productivity
savings
and
investment
with
these
energy
and
economic
policies
we
will
make
america
even
stronger
at
home
in
this
decadejust
as
our
foreign
and
defense
policies
will
make
us
stronger
and
safer
throughout
the
world
we
will
never
abandon
our
struggle
for
a
just
and
a
decent
society
here
at
home
thats
the
heart
of
americaand
its
the
source
of
our
ability
to
inspire
other
people
to
defend
their
own
rights
abroad
our
material
resources
great
as
they
are
are
limited
our
problems
are
too
complex
for
simple
slogans
or
for
quick
solutions
we
cannot
solve
them
without
effort
and
sacrifice
walter
lippmann
once

the
good
things
for
granted

you
must
earn
them
again
for
every
right

have
a
duty
which
you
must
fulfill
for
every
good
which
you
wish
to
preserve
you
will
have
to
sacrifice
your
comfort
and
your
ease

is
nothing

nothing

longer

a
new
spirit
of
unity

challenge
and
danger
a
decade
of
national
resolve
and
of
brave
achievement
thank
you
very
much

tonight
i
want
to
examine
in
a
broad
sense
the
state
of
our
american
unionhow
we
are
building
a
new
foundation
for
a
peaceful
and
a
prosperous
world
our
children
who
will
be
born
this
year
will
come
of
age
in
the
st
century
what
kind
of
society
what
kind
of
world
are
we
building
for
them
will
we
ourselves
be
at
peace
will
our
children
enjoy
a
better
quality
of
life
will
a
strong
and
united
america
still
be
a
force
for
freedom
and
prosperity
around
the
world
tonight
there
is
every
sign
that
the
state
of
our
union
is
sound
our
economy
offers
greater
prosperity
for
more
of
our
people
than
ever
before
real
per
capita
income
and
real
business
profits
have
risen
substantially
in
the
last
years
farm
exports
are
setting
an
alltime
record
each
year
and
farm
income
last
year
net
farm
income
was
up
more
than
percent
our
liberties
are
secure
our
military
defenses
are
strong
and
growing
stronger
and
more
importantly
tonight
americaour
beloved
countryis
at
peace
our
earliest
national
commitments
modified
and
reshaped
by
succeeding
generations
have
served
us
well
but
the
problems
that
we
face
today
are
different
from
those
that
confronted
earlier
generations
of
americans
they
are
more
subtle
more
complex
and
more
interrelated
at
home
we
are
recognizing
ever
more
clearly
that
government
alone
cannot
solve
these
problems
and
abroad
few
of
them
can
be
solved
by
the
united
states
alone
but
americans
as
a
united
people
working
with
our
allies
and
friends
have
never
been
afraid
to
face
problems
and
to
solve
problems
either
here
or
abroad
the
challenge
to
us
is
to
build
a
new
and
firmer
foundation
for
the
futurefor
a
sound
economy
for
a
more
effective
government
for
more
political
trust
and
for
a
stable
peaceso
that
the
america
our
children
inherit
will
be
even
stronger
and
even
better
than
it
is
today
we
cannot
resort
to
simplistic
or
extreme
solutions
which
substitute
myths
for
common
sense
in
our
economy
it
is
a
myth
that
we
must
choose
endlessly
between
inflation
and
recession
together
we
build
the
foundation
for
a
strong
economy
with
lower
inflation
without
contriving
either
a
recession
with
its
high
unemployment
or
unworkable
mandatory
government
controls
in
our
government
it
is
a
myth
that
we
must
choose
between
compassion
and
competence
together
we
build
the
foundation
for
a
government
that
works
and
works
for
people
in
our
relations
with
our
potential
adversaries
it
is
a
myth
that
we
must
choose
between
confrontation
and
capitulation
together
we
build
the
foundation
for
a
stable
world
of
both
diversity
and
peace
together
weve
already
begun
to
build
the
foundation
for
confidence
in
our
economic
system
during
the
last
years
in
bringing
our
economy
out
of
the
deepest
recession
since
the
s
weve
created
new
jobs
the
unemployment
rate
has
gone
down
percent
and
now
we
must
redouble
our
fight
against
the
persistent
inflation
that
has
wracked
our
country
for
more
than
a
decade
thats
our
important
domestic
issue
and
we
must
do
it
together
we
know
that
inflation
is
a
burden
for
all
americans
but
its
a
disaster
for
the
poor
the
sick
and
the
old
no
american
family
should
be
forced
to
choose
among
food
warmth
health
care
or
decent
housing
because
the
cost
of
any
of
these
basic
necessities
has
climbed
out
of
reach
three
months
ago
i
outlined
to
the
nation
a
balanced
antiinflation
program
that
couples
responsible
government
restraint
with
responsible
wage
and
price
restraint
its
based
upon
my
knowledge
that
there
is
a
more
powerful
force
than
government
compulsionthe
force
created
by
the
cooperative
efforts
of
millions
of
americans
working
toward
a
common
goal
business
and
labor
have
been
increasingly
supportive
its
imperative
that
we
in
government
do
our
part
we
must
stop
excessive
government
growth
and
we
must
control
government
spending
habits
ive
sent
to
this
congress
a
stringent
but
a
fair
budget
one
that
since
i
ran
for
president
in
will
have
cut
the
federal
deficit
in
half
and
as
a
percentage
of
our
gross
national
product
the
deficit
will
have
dropped
by
almost
percent
this
congress
had
a
good
record
last
year
and
i
now
ask
the
th
congress
to
continue
this
partnership
in
holding
the
line
on
excess
federal
spending
it
will
not
be
easy
but
we
must
be
strong
and
we
must
be
persistent
this
budget
is
a
clear
message
that
with
the
help
of
you
and
the
american
people
i
am
determined
as
president
to
bring
inflation
under
control
the
budget
provides
enough
spending
restraint
to
begin
unwinding
inflation
but
enough
support
for
our
country
to
keep
american
workers
productive
and
to
encourage
the
investments
that
provide
new
jobs
we
will
continue
to
mobilize
our
nations
resources
to
reduce
our
trade
deficit
substantially
this
year
and
to
maintain
the
strength
of
the
american
dollar
weve
demonstrated
in
this
restrained
budget
that
we
can
build
on
the
gains
of
the
past
years
to
provide
additional
support
to
educate
disadvantaged
children
to
care
for
the
elderly
to
provide
nutrition
and
legal
services
for
the
poor
and
to
strengthen
the
economic
base
of
our
urban
communities
and
also
our
rural
areas
this
year
we
will
take
our
first
steps
to
develop
a
national
health
plan
we
must
never
accept
a
permanent
group
of
unemployed
americans
with
no
hope
and
no
stake
in
building
our
society
for
those
left
out
of
the
economy
because
of
discrimination
a
lack
of
skills
or
poverty
we
must
maintain
high
levels
of
training
and
we
must
continue
to
provide
jobs
a
responsible
budget
is
not
our
only
weapon
to
control
inflation
we
must
act
now
to
protect
all
americans
from
health
care
costs
that
are
rising
million
per
hour
hours
a
day
doubling
every
years
we
must
take
control
of
the
largest
contributor
to
that
inflation
skyrocketing
hospital
costs
there
will
be
no
clearer
test
of
the
commitment
of
this
congress
to
the
antiinflation
fight
than
the
legislation
that
i
will
submit
again
this
year
to
hold
down
inflation
in
hospital
care
over
the
next
years
my
proposals
will
save
americans
a
total
of
billion
of
which
billion
will
be
savings
to
the
american
taxpayer
in
the
federal
budget
itself
the
american
people
have
waited
long
enough
this
year
we
must
act
on
hospital
cost
containment
we
must
also
fight
inflation
by
improvements
and
better
enforcement
of
our
antitrust
laws
and
by
reducing
government
obstacles
to
competition
in
the
private
sector
we
must
begin
to
scrutinize
the
overall
effect
of
regulation
in
our
economy
through
deregulation
of
the
airline
industry
weve
increased
profits
cut
prices
for
all
americans
and
begunfor
one
of
the
few
times
in
the
history
of
our
nationto
actually
dismantle
a
major
federal
bureaucracy
this
year
we
must
begin
the
effort
to
reform
our
regulatory
processes
for
the
railroad
bus
and
the
trucking
industries
america
has
the
greatest
economic
system
in
the
world
lets
reduce
government
interference
and
give
it
a
chance
to
work
i
call
on
congress
to
take
other
antiinflation
actionto
expand
our
exports
to
protect
american
jobs
threatened
by
unfair
trade
to
conserve
energy
to
increase
production
and
to
speed
development
of
solar
power
and
to
reassess
our
nations
technological
superiority
american
workers
who
enlist
in
the
fight
against
inflation
deserve
not
just
our
gratitude
but
they
deserve
the
protection
of
the
real
wage
insurance
proposal
that
i
have
already
made
to
the
congress
to
be
successful
we
must
change
our
attitudes
as
well
as
our
policies
we
cannot
afford
to
live
beyond
our
means
we
cannot
afford
to
create
programs
that
we
can
neither
manage
nor
finance
or
to
waste
our
natural
resources
and
we
cannot
tolerate
mismanagement
and
fraud
above
all
we
must
meet
the
challenges
of
inflation
as
a
united
people
with
the
support
of
the
american
people
government
in
recent
decades
has
helped
to
dismantle
racial
barriers
has
provided
assistance
for
the
jobless
and
the
retired
has
fed
the
hungry
has
protected
the
safety
health
and
bargaining
rights
of
american
workers
and
has
helped
to
preserve
our
natural
heritage
but
its
not
enough
to
have
created
a
lot
of
government
programs
now
we
must
make
the
good
programs
more
effective
and
improve
or
weed
out
those
which
are
wasteful
or
unnecessary
with
the
support
of
the
congress
weve
begun
to
reorganize
and
to
get
control
of
the
bureaucracy
we
are
reforming
the
civil
service
system
so
that
we
can
recognize
and
reward
those
who
do
a
good
job
and
correct
or
remove
those
who
do
not
this
year
we
must
extend
major
reorganization
efforts
to
education
to
economic
development
and
to
the
management
of
our
natural
resources
we
need
to
enact
a
sunshine
sunset
law
that
when
government
programs
have
outlived
their
value
they
will
automatically
be
terminated
theres
no
such
thing
as
an
effective
and
a
noncontroversial
reorganization
and
reform
but
we
know
that
honest
effective
government
is
essential
to
restore
public
faith
in
our
public
action
none
of
us
can
be
satisfied
when
twothirds
of
the
american
citizens
chose
not
to
vote
last
year
in
a
national
election
too
many
americans
feel
powerless
against
the
influence
of
private
lobbying
groups
and
the
unbelievable
flood
of
private
campaign
money
which
threatens
our
electoral
process
this
year
we
must
regain
the
publics
faith
by
requiring
limited
financial
funds
from
public
funds
for
congressional
election
campaigns
house
bill
provides
for
this
public
financing
of
campaigns
and
i
look
forward
with
a
great
deal
of
anticipation
to
signing
it
at
an
early
date
a
strong
economy
and
an
effective
government
will
restore
confidence
in
america
but
the
path
of
the
future
must
be
charted
in
peace
we
must
continue
to
build
a
new
and
a
firm
foundation
for
a
stable
world
community
we
are
building
that
new
foundation
from
a
position
of
national
strengththe
strength
of
our
own
defenses
the
strength
of
our
friendships
with
other
nations
and
of
our
oldest
american
ideals
americas
military
power
is
a
major
force
for
security
and
stability
in
the
world
we
must
maintain
our
strategic
capability
and
continue
the
progress
of
the
last
years
with
our
nato
allies
with
whom
we
have
increased

our
readiness
modernized
our
equipment
and
strengthened
our
defense
forces
in
europe
i
urge
you
to
support
the
strong
defense
budget
which
i
have
proposed
to
the
congress
but
our
national
security
in
this
complicated
age
requires
more
than
just
military
might
in
less
than
a
lifetime
world
population
has
more
than
doubled
colonial
empires
have
disappeared
and
a
hundred
new
nations
have
been
born
and
migration
to
the
worlds
cities
have
all
awakened
new
yearnings
for
economic
justice
and
human
rights
among
people
everywhere
this
demand
for
justice
and
human
rights
is
a
wave
of
the
future
in
such
a
world
the
choice
is
not
which
super
power
will
dominate
the
world
none
can
and
none
will
the
choice
instead
is
between
a
world
of
anarchy
and
destruction
or
a
world
of
cooperation
and
peace
in
such
a
world
we
seek
not
to
stifle
inevitable
change
but
to
influence
its
course
in
helpful
and
constructive
ways
that
enhance
our
values
our
national
interests
and
the
cause
of
peace
towering
over
this
volatile
changing
world
like
a
thundercloud
on
a
summer
day
looms
the
awesome
power
of
nuclear
weapons
we
will
continue
to
help
shape
the
forces
of
change
to
anticipate
emerging
problems
of
nuclear
proliferation
and
conventional
arms
sales
and
to
use
our
great
strength
parts
of
the
world
before
they
erupt
and
spread
we
have
no
desire
to
be
the
worlds
policeman
but
america
does
want
to
be
the
worlds
peacemaker
we
are
building
the
foundation
for
truly
global
cooperation
not
only
with
western
and
industrialized
nations
but
with
the
developing
countries
as
well
our
ties
with
japan
and
our
european
allies
are
stronger
than
ever
and
so
are
our
friendly
relations
with
the
people
of
latin
america
africa
and
the
western
pacific
and
asia
weve
won
new
respect
in
this
hemisphere
with
the
panama
canal
treaties
weve
gained
new
trust
with
the
developing
world
through
our
opposition
to
racism
our
commitment
to
human
rights
and
our
support
for
majority
rule
in
africa
the
multilateral
trade
negotiations
are
now
reaching
a
successful
conclusion
and
congressional
approval
is
essential
to
the
economic
wellbeing
of
our
own
country
and
of
the
world
this
will
be
one
of
our
top
priorities
in
we
are
entering
a
hopeful
era
in
our
relations
with
onefourth
of
the
worlds
people
who
live
in
china
the
presence
of
vice
premier
deng
xiaoping
next
week
will
help
to
inaugurate
that
new
era
and
with
prompt
congressional
action
on
authorizing
legislation
we
will
continue
our
commitment
to
a
prosperous
peaceful
and
secure
life
for
the
people
of
taiwan
im
grateful
that
in
the
past
year
as
in
the
year
before
no
american
has
died
in
combat
anywhere
in
the
world
and
in
iran
nicaragua
cyprus
namibia
and
rhodesia
our
country
is
working
for
peaceful
solutions
to
dangerous
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
under
the
most
difficult
circumstances
we
have
sought
to
help
ancient
enemies
lay
aside
deepseated
differences
that
have
produced
four
bitter
wars
in
our
lifetime
our
firm
commitment
to
israels
survival
and
security
is
rooted
in
our
deepest
convictions
and
in
our
knowledge
of
the
strategic
importance
to
our
own
nation
of
a
stable
middle
east
to
promote
peace
and
reconciliation
in
the
region
we
must
retain
the
trust
and
the
confidence
both
of
israel
and
also
of
the
arab
nations
that
are
sincerely
searching
for
peace
i
am
determined
as
president
to
use
the
full
beneficial
influence
of
our
country
so
that
the
precious
opportunity
for
lasting
peace
between
israel
and
egypt
will
not
be
lost
the
new
foundation
of
international
cooperation
that
we
seek
excludes
no
nation
cooperation
with
the
soviet
union
serves
the
cause
of
peace
for
in
this
nuclear
age
world
peace
must
include
peace
between
the
super
powersand
it
must
mean
the
control
of
nuclear
arms
ten
years
ago
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
made
the
historic
decision
to
open
the
strategic
arms
limitations
talks
or
salt
the
purpose
of
salt
then
as
now
is
not
to
gain
a
unilateral
advantage
for
either
nation
but
to
protect
the
security
of
both
nations
to
reverse
the
costly
and
dangerous
momentum
of
the
nuclear
arms
race
to
preserve
a
stable
balance
of
nuclear
forces
and
to
demonstrate
to
a
concerned
world
that
we
are
determined
to
help
preserve
the
peace
the
first
salt
agreement
was
concluded
in
and
since
then
during
years
of
negotiation
by
both
republican
and
democratic
leaders
nearly
all
issues
of
salt
ii
have
been
resolved
if
the
soviet
union
continues
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
a
responsible
salt
agreement
will
be
reached
its
important
that
the
american
people
understand
the
nature
of
the
salt
process
salt
ii
is
not
based
on
sentiment
its
based
on
selfinterestof
the
united
states
and
of
the
soviet
union
both
nations
share
a
powerful
common
interest
in
reducing
the
threat
of
a
nuclear
war
i
will
sign
no
agreement
which
does
not
enhance
our
national
security
salt
ii
does
not
rely
on
trust
it
will
be
verifiable
we
have
very
sophisticated
proven
means
including
our
satellites
to
determine
for
ourselves
whether
or
not
the
soviet
union
is
meeting
its
treaty
obligations
i
will
sign
no
agreement
which
cannot
be
verified
the
american
nuclear
deterrent
will
remain
strong
after
salt
ii
for
example
just
one
of
our
relatively
invulnerable
poseidon
submarinescomprising
less
than
percent
of
our
total
nuclear
force
of
submarines
aircraft
and
landbased
missilescarries
enough
warheads
to
destroy
every
large
and
mediumsized
city
in
the
soviet
union
our
deterrent
is
overwhelming
and
i
will
sign
no
agreement
unless
our
deterrent
force
will
remain
overwhelming
a
salt
agreement
of
course
cannot
substitute
for
wise
diplomacy
or
a
strong
defense
nor
will
it
end
the
danger
of
nuclear
war
but
it
will
certainly
reduce
that
danger
it
will
strengthen
our
efforts
to
ban
nuclear
tests
and
to
stop
the
spread
of
atomic
weapons
to
other
nations
and
it
can
begin
the
process
of
negotiating
new
agreements
which
will
further
limit
nuclear
arms
the
path
of
arms
control
backed
by
a
strong
defense
the
path
our
nation
and
every
president
has
walked
for
years
can
lead
to
a
world
of
law
and
of
international
negotiation
and
consultation
in
which
all
peoples
might
live
in
peace
in
this
year
nothing
is
more
important
than
that
the
congress
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
resolve
to
continue
with
me
on
that
path
of
nuclear
arms
control
and
world
peace
this
is
paramount
ive
outlined
some
of
the
changes
that
have
transformed
the
world
and
which
are
continuing
as
we
meet
here
tonight
but
we
in
america
need
not
fear
change
the
values
on
which
our
nation
was
founded
individual
liberty
selfdetermination
the
potential
for
human
fulfillment
in
freedom
all
of
these
endure
we
find
these
democratic
principles
praised
even
in
books
smuggled
out
of
totalitarian
nations
and
on
wallposters
in
lands
which
we
thought
were
closed
to
our
influence
our
country
has
regained
its
special
place
of
leadership
in
the
worldwide
struggle
for
human
rights
and
that
is
a
commitment
that
we
must
keep
at
home
as
well
as
abroad
the
civil
rights
revolution
freed
all
americans
black
and
white
but
its
full
promise
still
remains
unrealized
i
will
continue
to
work
with
all
my
strength
for
equal
opportunity
for
all
americansand
for
affirmative
action
for
those
who
carry
the
extra
burden
of
past
denial
of
equal
opportunity
we
remain
committed
to
improving
our
labor
laws
to
better
protect
the
rights
of
american
workers
and
our
nation
must
make
it
clear
that
the
legal
rights
of
women
as
citizens
are
guaranteed
under
the
laws
of
our
land
by
ratifying
the
equal
rights
amendment
as
long
as
im
president
at
home
and
around
the
world
americas
examples
and
americas
influence
will
be
marshaled
to
advance
the
cause
of
human
rights
to
establish
those
values
two
centuries
ago
a
bold
generation
of
americans
risked
their
property
their
position
and
life
itself
we
are
their
heirs
and
they
are
sending
us
a
message
across
the
centuries
the
words
they
made
so
vivid
are
now
growing
faintly
indistinct
because
they
are
not
heard
often
enough
they
are
words
like
justice
equality
unity
truth
sacrifice
liberty
faith
and
love
these
words
remind
us
that
the
duty
of
our
generation
of
americans
is
to
renew
our
nations
faith
not
focused
just
against
foreign
threats
but
against
the
threats
of
selfishness
cynicism
and
apathy
the
new
foundation
ive
discussed
tonight
can
help
us
build
a
nation
and
a
world
where
every
child
is
nurtured
and
can
look
to
the
future
with
hope
where
the
resources
now
wasted
on
war
can
be
turned
towards
meeting
human
needs
where
all
people
have
enough
to
eat
a
decent
home
and
protection
against
disease
it
can
help
us
build
a
nation
and
a
world
where
all
people
are
free
to
seek
the
truth
and
to
add
to
human
understanding
so
that
all
of
us
may
live
our
lives
in
peace
tonight
i
ask
you
the
members
of
the
congress
to
join
me
in
building
that
new
foundation
a
better
foundation
for
our
beloved
country
and
our
world
thank
you
very
much

two
years
ago
today
we
had
the
first
caucus
in
iowa
and
one
year
ago
tomorrow
i
walked
from
here
to
the
white
house
to
take
up
the
duties
of
president
of
the
united
states
i
didnt
know
it
then
when
i
walked
but
ive
been
trying
to
save
energy
ever
since
i
return
tonight
to
fulfill
one
of
those
duties
of
the
constitution
to
give
to
the
congress
and
to
the
nation
information
on
the
state
of
the
union
militarily
politically
economically
and
in
spirit
the
state
of
our
union
is
sound
we
are
a
great
country
a
strong
country
a
vital
and
dynamic
country
and
so
we
will
remain
we
are
a
confident
people
and
a
hardworking
people
a
decent
and
a
compassionate
people
and
so
we
will
remain
i
want
to
speak
to
you
tonight
about
where
we
are
and
where
we
must
go
about
what
we
have
done
and
what
we
must
do
and
i
want
to
pledge
to
you
my
best
efforts
and
ask
you
to
pledge
yours
each
generation
of
americans
has
to
face
circumstances
not
of
its
own
choosing
but
by
which
its
character
is
measured
and
its
spirit
is
tested
there
are
times
of
emergency
when
a
nation
and
its
leaders
must
bring
their
energies
to
bear
on
a
single
urgent
task
that
was
the
duty
abraham
lincoln
faced
when
our
land
was
torn
apart
by
conflict
in
the
war
between
the
states
that
was
the
duty
faced
by
franklin
roosevelt
when
he
led
america
out
of
an
economic
depression
and
again
when
he
led
america
to
victory
in
war
there
are
other
times
when
there
is
no
single
overwhelming
crisis
yet
profound
national
interests
are
at
stake
at
such
times
the
risk
of
inaction
can
be
equally
great
it
becomes
the
task
of
leaders
to
call
forth
the
vast
and
restless
energies
of
our
people
to
build
for
the
future
that
is
what
harry
truman
did
in
the
years
after
the
second
world
war
when
we
helped
europe
and
japan
rebuild
themselves
and
secured
an
international
order
that
has
protected
freedom
from
aggression
we
live
in
such
times
now
and
we
face
such
duties
weve
come
through
a
long
period
of
turmoil
and
doubt
but
weve
once
again
found
our
moral
course
and
with
a
new
spirit
we
are
striving
to
express
our
best
instincts
to
the
rest
of
the
world
there
is
all
across
our
land
a
growing
sense
of
peace
and
a
sense
of
common
purpose
this
sense
of
unity
cannot
be
expressed
in
programs
or
in
legislation
or
in
dollars
its
an
achievement
that
belongs
to
every
individual
american
this
unity
ties
together
and
it
towers
over
all
our
efforts
here
in
washington
and
it
serves
as
an
inspiring
beacon
for
all
of
us
who
are
elected
to
serve
this
new
atmosphere
demands
a
new
spirit
a
partnership
between
those
of
us
who
lead
and
those
who
elect
the
foundations
of
this
partnership
are
truth
the
courage
to
face
hard
decisions
concern
for
one
another
and
the
common
good
over
special
interests
and
a
basic
faith
and
trust
in
the
wisdom
and
strength
and
judgment
of
the
american
people
for
the
first
time
in
a
generation
we
are
not
haunted
by
a
major
international
crisis
or
by
domestic
turmoil
and
we
now
have
a
rare
and
a
priceless
opportunity
to
address
persistent
problems
and
burdens
which
come
to
us
as
a
nation
quietly
and
steadily
getting
worse
over
the
years
as
president
ive
had
to
ask
you
the
members
of
congress
and
you
the
american
people
to
come
to
grips
with
some
of
the
most
difficult
and
hard
questions
facing
our
society
we
must
make
a
maximum
effort
because
if
we
do
not
aim
for
the
best
we
are
very
likely
to
achieve
little
i
see
no
benefit
to
the
country
if
we
delay
because
the
problems
will
only
get
worse
we
need
patience
and
good
will
but
we
really
need
to
realize
that
there
is
a
limit
to
the
role
and
the
function
of
government
government
cannot
solve
our
problems
it
cant
set
our
goals
it
cannot
define
our
vision
government
cannot
eliminate
poverty
or
provide
a
bountiful
economy
or
reduce
inflation
or
save
our
cities
or
cure
illiteracy
or
provide
energy
and
government
cannot
mandate
goodness
only
a
true
partnership
between
government
and
the
people
can
ever
hope
to
reach
these
goals
those
of
us
who
govern
can
sometimes
inspire
and
we
can
identify
needs
and
marshal
resources
but
we
simply
cannot
be
the
managers
of
everything
and
everybody
we
here
in
washington
must
move
away
from
crisis
management
and
we
must
establish
clear
goals
for
the
future
immediate
and
the
distant
future
which
will
let
us
work
together
and
not
in
conflict
never
again
should
we
neglect
a
growing
crisis
like
the
shortage
of
energy
where
further
delay
will
only
lead
to
more
harsh
and
painful
solutions
every
day
we
spend
more
than
million
for
foreign
oil
this
slows
our
economic
growth
it
lowers
the
value
of
the
dollar
overseas
and
it
aggravates
unemployment
and
inflation
here
at
home
now
we
know
what
we
must
do
increase
production
we
must
cut
down
on
waste
and
we
must
use
more
of
those
fuels
which
are
plentiful
and
more
permanent
we
must
be
fair
to
people
and
we
must
not
disrupt
our
nations
economy
and
our
budget
now
that
sounds
simple
but
i
recognize
the
difficulties
involved
i
know
that
it
is
not
easy
for
the
congress
to
act
but
the
fact
remains
that
on
the
energy
legislation
we
have
failed
the
american
people
almost
years
after
the
oil
embargo
dramatized
the
problem
for
us
all
we
still
do
not
have
a
national
energy
program
not
much
longer
can
we
tolerate
this
stalemate
it
undermines
our
national
interest
both
at
home
and
abroad
we
must
succeed
and
i
believe
we
will
our
main
task
at
home
this
year
with
energy
a
central
element
is
the
nations
economy
we
must
continue
the
recovery
and
further
cut
unemployment
and
inflation
last
year
was
a
good
one
for
the
united
states
we
reached
all
of
our
major
economic
goals
for
four
million
new
jobs
were
created
an
alltime
record
and
the
number
of
unemployed
dropped
by
more
than
a
million
unemployment
right
now
is
the
lowest
it
has
been
since
and
not
since
world
war
ii
has
such
a
high
percentage
of
american
people
been
employed
the
rate
of
inflation
went
down
there
was
a
good
growth
in
business
profits
and
investments
the
source
of
more
jobs
for
our
workers
and
a
higher
standard
of
living
for
all
our
people
after
taxes
and
inflation
there
was
a
healthy
increase
in
workers
wages
and
this
year
our
country
will
have
the
first
trillion
economy
in
the
history
of
the
world
now
we
are
proud
of
this
progress
the
first
year
but
we
must
do
even
better
in
the
future
we
still
have
serious
problems
on
which
all
of
us
must
work
together
our
trade
deficit
is
too
large
inflation
is
still
too
high
and
too
many
americans
still
do
not
have
a
job
now
i
didnt
have
any
simple
answers
for
all
these
problems
but
we
have
developed
an
economic
policy
that
is
working
because
its
simple
balanced
and
fair
its
based
on
four
principles
first
the
economy
must
keep
on
expanding
to
produce
new
jobs
and
better
income
which
our
people
need
the
fruits
of
growth
must
be
widely
shared
more
jobs
must
be
made
available
to
those
who
have
been
bypassed
until
now
and
the
tax
system
must
be
made
fairer
and
simpler
secondly
private
business
and
not
the
government
must
lead
the
expansion
in
the
future
third
we
must
lower
the
rate
of
inflation
and
keep
it
down
inflation
slows
down
economic
growth
and
its
the
most
cruel
to
the
poor
and
also
to
the
elderly
and
others
who
live
on
fixed
incomes
and
fourth
we
must
contribute
to
the
strength
of
the
world
economy
i
will
announce
detailed
proposals
for
improving
our
tax
system
later
this
week
we
can
make
our
tax
laws
fairer
we
can
make
them
simpler
and
easier
to
understand
and
at
the
same
time
we
can
and
we
will
reduce
the
tax
burden
on
american
citizens
by
billion
the
tax
reforms
and
the
tax
reductions
go
together
only
with
the
long
overdue
reforms
will
the
full
tax
cut
be
advisable
almost
billion
in
income
tax
cuts
will
go
to
individuals
ninetysix
percent
of
all
american
taxpayers
will
see
their
taxes
go
down
for
a
typical
family
of
four
this
means
an
annual
saving
of
more
than
a
year
or
a
tax
reduction
of
about
percent
a
further
billion
cut
in
excise
taxes
will
give
more
relief
and
also
contribute
directly
to
lowering
the
rate
of
inflation
and
we
will
also
provide
strong
additional
incentives
for
business
investment
and
growth
through
substantial
cuts
in
the
corporate
tax
rates
and
improvement
in
the
investment
tax
credit
now
these
tax
proposals
will
increase
opportunity
everywhere
in
the
nation
but
additional
jobs
for
the
disadvantaged
deserve
special
attention
weve
already
passed
laws
to
assure
equal
access
to
the
voting
booth
and
to
restaurants
and
to
schools
to
housing
and
laws
to
permit
access
to
jobs
but
job
opportunity
the
chance
to
earn
a
decent
living
is
also
a
basic
human
right
which
we
cannot
and
will
not
ignore
a
major
priority
for
our
nation
is
the
final
elimination
of
the
barriers
that
restrict
the
opportunities
available
to
women
and
also
to
black
people
and
hispanics
and
other
minorities
weve
come
a
long
way
toward
that
goal
but
there
is
still
much
to
do
what
we
inherited
from
the
past
must
not
be
permitted
to
shackle
us
in
the
future
ill
be
asking
you
for
a
substantial
increase
in
funds
for
public
jobs
for
our
young
people
and
i
also
am
recommending
that
the
congress
continue
the
public
service
employment
programs
at
more
than
twice
the
level
of
a
year
ago
when
welfare
reform
is
completed
we
will
have
more
than
a
million
additional
jobs
so
that
those
on
welfare
who
are
able
to
work
can
work
however
again
we
know
that
in
our
free
society
private
business
is
still
the
best
source
of
new
jobs
therefore
i
will
propose
a
new
program
to
encourage
businesses
to
hire
young
and
disadvantaged
americans
these
young
people
only
need
skills
and
a
chance
in
order
to
take
their
place
in
our
economic
system
lets
give
them
the
chance
they
need
a
major
step
in
the
right
direction
would
be
the
early
passage
of
a
greatly
improved
humphreyhawkins
bill
my
budget
for
addresses
these
national
needs
but
it
is
lean
and
tight
i
have
cut
waste
wherever
possible
i
am
proposing
an
increase
of
less
than
percent
after
adjusting
for
inflation
the
smallest
increase
in
the
federal
budget
in
years
lately
federal
spend
ing
has
taken
a
steadily
increasing
portion
of
what
americans
produce
our
new
budget
reverses
that
trend
and
later
i
hope
to
bring
the
governments
toll
down
even
further
and
with
your
help
well
do
that
in
time
of
high
employment
and
a
strong
economy
deficit
spending
should
not
be
a
feature
of
our
budget
as
the
economy
continues
to
gain
strength
and
as
our
unemployment
rates
continue
to
fall
revenues
will
grow
with
careful
planning
efficient
management
and
proper
restraint
on
spending
we
can
move
rapidly
toward
a
balanced
budget
and
we
will
next
year
the
budget
deficit
will
be
only
slightly
less
than
this
year
but
onethird
of
the
deficit
is
due
to
the
necessary
tax
cuts
that
ive
proposed
this
year
the
right
choice
is
to
reduce
the
burden
on
taxpayers
and
provide
more
jobs
for
our
people
the
third
element
in
our
program
is
a
renewed
attack
on
inflation
weve
learned
the
hard
way
that
high
unemployment
will
not
prevent
or
cure
inflation
government
can
help
us
by
stimulating
private
investment
and
by
maintaining
a
responsible
economic
policy
through
a
new
toplevel
review
process
we
will
do
a
better
job
of
reducing
government
regulation
that
drives
up
costs
and
drives
up
prices
but
again
government
alone
cannot
bring
down
the
rate
of
inflation
when
a
level
of
high
inflation
is
expected
to
continue
then
companies
raise
prices
to
protect
their
profit
margins
against
prospective
increases
in
wages
and
other
costs
while
workers
demand
higher
wages
as
protection
against
expected
price
increases
its
like
an
escalation
in
the
arms
race
and
understandably
no
one
wants
to
disarm
alone
now
no
one
firm
or
a
group
of
workers
can
halt
this
process
its
an
effort
that
we
must
all
make
together
im
therefore
asking
government
business
labor
and
other
groups
to
join
in
a
voluntary
program
to
moderate
inflation
by
holding
wage
and
price
increases
in
each
sector
of
the
economy
during
below
the
average
increases
of
the
last
years
i
do
not
believe
in
wage
and
price
controls
a
sincere
commitment
to
voluntary
constraint
provides
a
way
perhaps
the
only
way
to
fight
inflation
without
government
interference
as
i
came
into
the
capitol
tonight
i
saw
the
farmers
my
fellow
farmers
standing
out
in
the
snow
im
familiar
with
their
problem
and
i
know
from
congress
action
that
you
are
too
when
i
was
running
carters
warehouse
we
had
spread
on
our
own
farms
fertilizer
for
about
a
ton
the
last
time
i
was
home
the
price
was
about
a
ton
the
cost
of
nitrogen
has
gone
up
percent
and
the
price
of
products
that
farmers
sell
has
either
stayed
the
same
or
gone
down
a
little
now
this
past
year
in
you
the
congress
and
i
together
passed
a
new
agricultural
act
it
went
into
effect
october
itll
have
its
first
impact
on
the
crops
it
will
help
a
great
deal
itll
add
billion
or
more
to
help
the
farmers
with
their
price
supports
and
target
prices
last
year
we
had
the
highest
level
of
exports
of
farm
products
in
the
history
of
our
country
billion
we
expect
to
have
more
this
year
well
be
working
together
but
i
think
its
incumbent
on
us
to
monitor
very
carefully
the
farm
situation
and
continue
to
work
harmoniously
with
the
farmers
of
our
country
whats
best
for
the
farmers
the
farm
families
in
the
long
run
is
also
best
for
the
consumers
of
our
country
economic
success
at
home
is
also
the
key
to
success
in
our
international
economic
policy
an
effective
energy
program
strong
investment
and
productivity
and
controlled
inflation
will
provide
improve
our
trade
balance
and
balance
it
and
it
will
help
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
dollar
overseas
by
working
closely
with
our
friends
abroad
we
can
promote
the
economic
health
of
the
whole
world
with
fair
and
balanced
agreements
lowering
the
barriers
to
trade
despite
the
inevitable
pressures
that
build
up
when
the
world
economy
suffers
from
high
unemployment
we
must
firmly
resist
the
demands
for
selfdefeating
protectionism
but
free
trade
must
also
be
fair
trade
and
i
am
determined
to
protect
american
industry
and
american
workers
against
foreign
trade
practices
which
are
unfair
or
illegal
in
a
separate
written
message
to
congress
ive
outlined
other
domestic
initiatives
such
as
welfare
reform
consumer
protection
basic
education
skills
urban
policy
reform
of
our
labor
laws
and
national
health
care
later
on
this
year
i
will
not
repeat
these
tonight
but
there
are
several
other
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
directly
to
you
during
these
past
years
americans
have
seen
our
government
grow
far
from
us
for
some
citizens
the
government
has
almost
become
like
a
foreign
country
so
strange
and
distant
that
weve
often
had
to
deal
with
it
through
trained
ambassadors
who
have
sometimes
become
too
powerful
and
too
influential
lawyers
accountants
and
lobbyists
this
cannot
go
on
we
must
have
what
abraham
lincoln
wanted
a
government
for
the
people
weve
made
progress
toward
that
kind
of
government
youve
given
me
the
authority
i
requested
to
reorganize
the
federal
bureaucracy
and
i
am
using
that
authority
weve
already
begun
a
series
of
reorganization
plans
which
will
be
completed
over
a
period
of
years
we
have
also
proposed
abolishing
almost
federal
advisory
and
other
commissions
and
boards
but
i
know
that
the
american
people
are
still
sick
and
tired
of
federal
paperwork
and
redtape
bit
by
bit
we
are
chopping
down
the
thicket
of
unnecessary
federal
regulations
by
which
government
too
often
interferes
in
our
personal
lives
and
our
personal
business
weve
cut
the
publics
federal
paperwork
load
by
more
than
percent
in
less
than
a
year
and
we
are
not
through
cutting
weve
made
a
good
start
on
turning
the
gobbledygook
of
federal
regulations
into
plain
english
that
people
can
understand
but
we
know
that
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
weve
brought
together
parts
of
government
agencies
to
create
a
new
department
of
energy
and
now
its
time
to
take
another
major
step
by
creating
a
separate
department
of
education
but
even
the
best
organized
government
will
only
be
as
effective
as
the
people
who
carry
out
its
policies
for
this
reason
i
consider
civil
service
reform
to
be
absolutely
vital
worked
out
with
the
civil
servants
themselves
this
reorganization
plan
will
restore
the
merit
principle
to
a
system
which
has
grown
into
a
bureaucratic
maze
it
will
provide
greater
management
flexibility
and
better
rewards
for
better
performance
without
compromising
job
security
then
and
only
then
can
we
have
a
government
that
is
efficient
open
and
truly
worthy
of
our
peoples
understanding
and
respect
i
have
promised
that
we
will
have
such
a
government
and
i
intend
to
keep
that
promise
in
our
foreign
policy
the
separation
of
people
from
government
has
been
in
the
past
a
source
of
weakness
and
error
in
a
democratic
system
like
ours
foreign
policy
decisions
must
be
able
to
stand
the
test
of
public
examination
and
public
debate
if
we
make
a
mistake
in
this
administration
it
will
be
on
the
side
of
frankness
and
openness
with
the
american
people
in
our
modern
world
when
the
deaths
of
literally
millions
of
people
can
result
from
a
few
terrifying
seconds
of
destruction
the
path
of
national
strength
and
security
is
identical
to
the
path
of
peace
tonight
i
am
happy
to
report
that
because
we
are
strong
our
nation
is
at
peace
with
the
world
we
are
a
confident
nation
weve
restored
a
moral
basis
for
our
foreign
policy
the
very
heart
of
our
identity
as
a
nation
is
our
firm
commitment
to
human
rights
we
stand
for
human
rights
because
we
believe
that
government
has
as
a
purpose
to
promote
the
wellbeing
of
its
citizens
this
is
true
in
our
domestic
policy
its
also
true
in
our
foreign
policy
the
world
must
know
that
in
support
of
human
rights
the
united
states
will
stand
firm
we
expect
no
quick
or
easy
results
but
there
has
been
significant
movement
toward
greater
freedom
and
humanity
in
several
parts
of
the
world
thousands
of
political
prisoners
have
been
freed
the
leaders
of
the
world
even
our
ideological
adversaries
now
see
that
their
attitude
toward
fundamental
human
rights
affects
their
standing
in
the
international
community
and
it
affects
their
relations
with
the
united
states
to
serve
the
interests
of
every
american
our
foreign
policy
has
three
major
goals
the
first
and
prime
concern
is
and
will
remain
the
security
of
our
country
security
is
based
on
our
national
will
and
security
is
based
on
the
strength
of
our
armed
forces
we
have
the
will
and
militarily
we
are
very
strong
security
also
comes
through
the
strength
of
our
alliances
we
have
reconfirmed
our
commitment
to
the
defense
of
europe
and
this
year
we
will
demonstrate
that
commitment
by
further
modernizing
and
strengthening
our
military
capabilities
there
security
can
also
be
enhanced
by
agreements
with
potential
adversaries
which
reduce
the
threat
of
nuclear
disaster
while
maintaining
our
own
relative
strategic
capability
in
areas
of
peaceful
competition
with
the
soviet
union
we
will
continue
to
more
than
hold
our
own
at
the
same
time
we
are
negotiating
with
quiet
confidence
without
haste
with
careful
determination
to
ease
the
tensions
between
us
and
to
ensure
greater
stability
and
security
the
strategic
arms
limitation
talks
have
been
long
and
difficult
we
want
a
mutual
limit
on
both
the
quality
and
the
quantity
of
the
giant
nuclear
arsenals
of
both
nations
and
then
we
want
actual
reductions
in
strategic
arms
as
a
major
step
toward
the
ultimate
elimination
of
nuclear
weapons
from
the
face
of
the
earth
if
these
talks
result
in
an
agreement
this
year
and
i
trust
they
will
i
pledge
to
you
that
the
agreement
will
maintain
and
enhance
the
stability
of
the
worlds
strategic
balance
and
the
security
of
the
united
states
for
years
concerted
but
unsuccessful
efforts
have
been
made
to
ban
the
testing
of
atomic
explosives
both
military
weapons
and
peaceful
nuclear
devices
we
are
hard
at
work
with
great
britain
and
the
soviet
union
on
an
agreement
which
will
stop
testing
and
will
protect
our
national
security
and
provide
for
adequate
verification
of
compliance
we
are
now
making
i
believe
good
progress
toward
this
comprehensive
ban
on
nuclear
explo
sions
we
are
also
working
vigorously
to
halt
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons
among
the
nations
of
the
world
which
do
not
now
have
them
and
to
reduce
the
deadly
global
traffic
in
conventional
arms
sales
our
stand
for
peace
is
suspect
if
we
are
also
the
principal
arms
merchant
of
the
world
so
weve
decided
to
cut
down
our
arms
transfers
abroad
on
a
yearbyyear
basis
and
to
work
with
other
major
arms
exporters
to
encourage
their
similar
constraint
every
american
has
a
stake
in
our
second
major
goal
a
world
at
peace
in
a
nuclear
age
each
of
us
is
threatened
when
peace
is
not
secured
everywhere
we
are
trying
to
promote
harmony
in
those
parts
of
the
world
where
major
differences
exist
among
other
nations
and
threaten
international
peace
in
the
middle
east
we
are
contributing
our
good
offices
to
maintain
the
momentum
of
the
current
negotiations
and
to
keep
open
the
lines
of
communication
among
the
middle
eastern
leaders
the
whole
world
has
a
great
stake
in
the
success
of
these
efforts
this
is
a
precious
opportunity
for
a
historic
settlement
of
a
longstanding
conflict
an
opportunity
which
may
never
come
again
in
our
lifetime
our
role
has
been
difficult
and
sometimes
thankless
and
controversial
but
it
has
been
constructive
and
it
has
been
necessary
and
it
will
continue
our
third
major
foreign
policy
goal
is
one
that
touches
the
life
of
every
american
citizen
every
day
world
economic
growth
and
stability
this
requires
strong
economic
performance
by
the
industrialized
democracies
like
ourselves
and
progress
in
resolving
the
global
energy
crisis
last
fall
with
the
help
of
others
we
succeeded
in
our
vigorous
efforts
to
maintain
the
stability
of
the
price
of
oil
but
as
many
foreign
leaders
have
emphasized
to
me
personally
and
i
am
sure
to
you
the
greatest
future
contribution
that
america
can
make
to
the
world
economy
would
be
an
effective
energy
conservation
program
here
at
home
we
will
not
hesitate
to
take
the
actions
needed
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
american
dollar
we
are
trying
to
develop
a
more
just
international
system
and
in
this
spirit
we
are
supporting
the
struggle
for
human
development
in
africa
in
asia
and
in
latin
america
finally
the
world
is
watching
to
see
how
we
act
on
one
of
our
most
important
and
controversial
items
of
business
approval
of
the
panama
canal
treaties
the
treaties
now
before
the
senate
are
the
result
of
the
work
of
four
administrations
two
democratic
two
republican
they
guarantee
that
the
canal
will
be
open
always
for
unrestricted
use
by
the
ships
of
the
world
our
ships
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
head
of
the
line
for
priority
of
passage
in
times
of
emergency
or
need
we
retain
the
permanent
right
to
defend
the
canal
with
our
own
military
forces
if
necessary
to
guarantee
its
openness
and
its
neutrality
the
treaties
are
to
the
clear
advantage
of
ourselves
the
panamanians
and
the
other
users
of
the
canal
ratifying
the
panama
canal
treaties
will
demonstrate
our
good
faith
to
the
world
discourage
the
spread
of
hostile
ideologies
in
this
hemisphere
and
directly
contribute
to
the
economic
wellbeing
and
the
security
of
the
united
states
i
have
to
say
that
thats
very
welcome
applause
there
were
two
moments
on
my
recent
journey
which
for
me
confirmed
the
final
aims
of
our
foreign
policy
and
what
it
always
must
be
one
was
in
a
little
village
in
india
where
i
met
a
people
as
passionately
attached
to
their
rights
and
liberties
as
we
are
but
whose
children
have
a
far
smaller
chance
for
good
health
or
food
or
education
or
human
fulfillment
than
a
child
born
in
this
country
the
other
moment
was
in
warsaw
capital
of
a
nation
twice
devastated
by
war
in
this
century
there
people
have
rebuilt
the
city
which
wars
destruction
took
from
them
but
what
was
new
only
emphasized
clearly
what
was
lost
what
i
saw
in
those
two
places
crystalized
for
me
the
purposes
of
our
own
nations
policy
to
ensure
economic
justice
to
advance
human
rights
to
resolve
conflicts
without
violence
and
to
proclaim
in
our
great
democracy
our
constant
faith
in
the
liberty
and
dignity
of
human
beings
everywhere
we
americans
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
together
in
the
end
how
well
we
do
that
work
will
depend
on
the
spirit
in
which
we
approach
it
we
must
seek
fresh
answers
unhindered
by
the
stale
prescriptions
of
the
past
it
has
been
said
that
our
best
years
are
behind
us
but
i
say
again
that
americas
best
is
still
ahead
we
have
emerged
from
bitter
experiences
chastened
but
proud
confident
once
again
ready
to
face
challenges
once
again
and
united
once
again
we
come
together
tonight
at
a
solemn
time
last
week
the
senate
lost
a
good
and
honest
man
lee
metcalf
of
montana
and
today
the
flag
of
the
united
states
flew
at
halfmast
from
this
capitol
and
from
american
installations
and
ships
all
over
the
world
in
mourning
for
senator
hubert
humphrey
because
he
exemplified
so
well
the
joy
and
the
zest
of
living
his
death
reminds
us
not
so
much
of
our
own
mortality
but
of
the
possibilities
offered
to
us
by
life
he
always
looked
to
the
future
with
a
special
american
kind
of
confidence
of
hope
and
enthusiasm
and
the
best
way
that
we
can
honor
him
is
by
following
his
example
our
task
to
use
the
words
of
senator
humphrey
is
reconciliation
rebuilding
and
rebirth
reconciliation
of
private
needs
and
interests
into
a
higher
purpose
rebuilding
the
old
dreams
of
justice
and
liberty
and
country
and
community
rebirth
of
our
faith
in
the
common
good
each
of
us
here
tonight
and
all
who
are
listening
in
your
homes
must
rededicate
ourselves
to
serving
the
common
good
we
are
a
community
a
beloved
community
all
of
us
our
individual
fates
are
linked
our
futures
intertwined
and
if
we
act
in
that
knowledge
and
in
that
spirit
together
as
the
bible
says
we
can
move
mountains
thank
you
very
much

mr
speaker
mr
president
members
of
the
congress
and
my
fellow
americans
for
the
sixth
and
the
last
time
i
present
to
the
congress
my
assessment
of
the
state
of
the
union
i
shall
speak
to
you
tonight
about
challenge
and
opportunityand
about
the
commitments
that
all
of
us
have
made
together
that
will
if
we
carry
them
out
give
america
our
best
chance
to
achieve
the
kind
of
great
society
that
we
all
want
every
president
lives
not
only
with
what
is
but
with
what
has
been
and
what
could
be
most
of
the
great
events
in
his
presidency
are
part
of
a
larger
sequence
extending
back
through
several
years
and
extending
back
through
several
other
administrations
urban
unrest
poverty
pressures
on
welfare
education
of
our
people
law
enforcement
and
law
and
order
the
continuing
crisis
in
the
middle
east
the
conflict
in
vietnam
the
dangers
of
nuclear
war
the
great
difficulties
of
dealing
with
the
communist
powers
all
have
this
much
in
common
they
and
their
causesthe
causes
that
gave
rise
to
themall
of
these
have
existed
with
us
for
many
years
several
presidents
have
already
sought
to
try
to
deal
with
them
one
or
more
presidents
will
try
to
resolve
them
or
try
to
contain
them
in
the
years
that
are
ahead
of
us
but
if
the
nations
problems
are
continuing
so
are
this
great
nations
assets
our
economy
the
democratic
system
our
sense
of
exploration
symbolized
most
recently
by
the
wonderful
flight
of
the
apollo
in
which
all
americans
took
great
pride
the
good
commonsense
and
sound
judgment
of
the
american
people
and
their
essential
love
of
justice
we
must
not
ignore
our
problems
but
neither
should
we
ignore
our
strengths
those
strengths
are
available
to
sustain
a
president
of
either
partyto
support
his
progressive
efforts
both
at
home
and
overseas
unfortunately
the
departure
of
an
administration
does
not
mean
the
end
of
the
problems
that
this
administration
has
faced
the
effort
to
meet
the
problems
must
go
on
year
after
year
if
the
momentum
that
we
have
all
mounted
together
in
these
past
years
is
not
to
be
lost
although
the
struggle
for
progressive
change
is
continuous
there
are
times
when
a
watershed
is
reachedwhen
there
isif
not
really
a
break
with
the
pastat
least
the
fulfillment
of
many
of
its
oldest
hopes
and
a
stepping
forth
into
a
new
environment
to
seek
new
goals
i
think
the
past
years
have
been
such
a
time
we
have
finished
a
major
part
of
the
old
agenda
some
of
the
laws
that
we
wrote
have
already
in
front
of
our
eyes
taken
on
the
flesh
of
achievement
medicare
that
we
were
unable
to
pass
for
so
many
years
is
now
a
part
of
american
life
voting
rights
and
the
voting
booth
that
we
debated
so
long
back
in
the
riffles
and
the
doors
to
public
service
are
open
at
last
to
all
americans
regardless
of
their
color
schools
and
school
children
all
over
america
tonight
are
receiving
federal
assistance
to
go
to
good
schools
preschool
educationhead
startis
already
here
to
stay
and
i
think
so
are
the
federal
programs
that
tonight
are
keeping
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
of
the
cream
of
our
young
people
in
the
colleges
and
the
universities
of
this
country
part
of
the
american
earthnot
only
in
description
on
a
map
but
in
the
reality
of
our
shores
our
hills
our
parks
our
forests
and
our
mountainshas
been
permanently
set
aside
for
the
american
public
and
for
their
benefit
and
there
is
more
that
will
be
set
aside
before
this
administration
ends
five
million
americans
have
been
trained
for
jobs
in
new
federal
programs
i
think
it
is
most
important
that
we
all
realize
tonight
that
this
nation
is
close
to
full
employmentwith
less
unemployment
than
we
have
had
at
any
time
in
almost
years
that
is
not
in
theory
that
is
in
fact
tonight
the
unemployment
rate
is
down
to
percent
the
number
of
jobs
has
grown
more
than
million
in
the
last
years
that
is
more
than
in
all
the
preceding
years
these
achievements
completed
the
full
cycle
from
idea
to
enactment
and
finally
to
a
place
in
the
lives
of
citizens
all
across
this
country
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
say
that
everything
that
this
congress
and
the
administration
achieved
during
this
period
had
already
completed
that
cycle
but
a
great
deal
of
what
we
have
committed
needs
additional
funding
to
become
a
tangible
realization
yet
the
very
existence
of
these
commitmentsthese
promises
to
the
american
people
made
by
this
congress
and
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
governmentare
achievements
in
themselves
and
failure
to
carry
through
on
our
commitments
would
be
a
tragedy
for
this
nation
this
much
is
certain
no
one
man
or
group
of
men
made
these
commitments
alone
congress
and
the
executive
branch
with
their
checks
and
balances
reasoned
together
and
finally
wrote
them
into
the
law
of
the
land
they
now
have
all
the
moral
force
that
the
american
political
system
can
summon
when
it
acts
as
one
they
express
americas
common
determination
to
achieve
goals
they
imply
action
in
most
cases
you
have
already
begun
that
actionbut
it
is
not
fully
completed
of
course
let
me
speak
for
a
moment
about
these
commitments
i
am
going
to
speak
in
the
language
which
the
congress
itself
spoke
when
it
passed
these
measures
i
am
going
to
quote
from
your
words
in
congress
declared
that
improving
the
quality
of
urban
life
is
the
most
critical
domestic
problem
facing
the
united
states
two
years
later
it
affirmed
the
historic
goal
of
a
decent
home
for
every
american
family
that
is
your
language
now
to
meet
these
commitments
we
must
increase
our
support
for
the
model
cities
program
where
blueprints
of
change
are
already
being
prepared
in
more
than
american
cities
to
achieve
the
goals
of
the
housing
act
of
that
you
have
already
passed
we
should
begin
this
year
more
than
homes
for
needy
families
in
the
coming
fiscal
year
funds
are
provided
in
the
new
budget
to
do
just
this
this
is
almost
times
timesthe
average
rate
of
the
past
years
our
cities
and
our
towns
are
being
pressed
for
funds
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
growing
populations
so
i
believe
an
urban
development
bank
should
be
created
by
the
congress
this
bank
could
obtain
resources
through
the
issuance
of
taxable
bonds
and
it
could
then
lend
these
resources
at
reduced
rates
to
the
communities
throughout
the
land
for
schools
hospitals
parks
and
other
public
facilities
since
we
enacted
the
social
security
act
back
in
congress
has
recognized
the
necessity
to
make
more
adequate
provision
for
aged
persons
through
maternal
and
child
welfare
and
public
health
those
are
the
words
of
the
congressmore
adequate
the
time
has
come
i
think
to
make
it
more
adequate
i
believe
we
should
increase
social
security
benefits
and
i
am
so
recommending
tonight
i
am
suggesting
that
there
should
be
an
overall
increase
in
benefits
of
at
least
percent
those
who
receive
only
the
minimum
of
should
get
a
month
our
nation
too
is
rightfully
proud
of
our
medical
advances
but
we
should
remember
that
our
country
ranks
th
among
the
nations
of
the
world
in
its
infant
mortality
rate
i
think
we
should
assure
decent
medical
care
for
every
expectant
mother
and
for
their
children
during
the
first
year
of
their
life
in
the
united
states
of
america
i
think
we
should
protect
our
children
and
their
families
from
the
costs
of
catastrophic
illness
as
we
pass
on
from
medicine
i
think
nothing
is
clearer
to
the
congress
than
the
commitment
that
the
congress
made
to
end
poverty
congress
expressed
it
well
i
think
in
when
they
said
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
eliminate
the
paradox
of
poverty
in
the
midst
of
plenty
in
this
nation
this
is
the
richest
nation
in
the
world
the
antipoverty
program
has
had
many
achievements
it
also
has
some
failures
but
we
must
not
cripple
it
after
only
years
of
trying
to
solve
the
human
problems
that
have
been
with
us
and
have
been
building
up
among
us
for
generations
i
believe
the
congress
this
year
will
want
to
improve
the
administration
of
the
poverty
program
by
reorganizing
portions
of
it
and
transferring
them
to
other
agencies
i
believe
though
it
will
want
to
continue
until
we
have
broken
the
back
of
poverty
the
efforts
we
are
now
making
throughout
this
land
i
believe
and
i
hope
the
next
administrationi
believe
they
believethat
the
key
to
success
in
this
effort
is
jobs
it
is
work
for
people
who
want
to
work
in
the
budget
for
fiscal
i
shall
recommend
a
total
of
billion
for
our
job
training
program
and
that
is
five
times
as
much
as
we
spent
in
trying
to
prepare
americans
where
they
can
work
to
earn
their
own
living
the
nations
commitment
in
the
field
of
civil
rights
began
with
the
declaration
of
independence
they
were
extended
by
the
th
th
and
th
amendments
they
have
been
powerfully
strengthened
by
the
enactment
of
three
farreaching
civil
rights
laws
within
the
past
years
that
this
congress
in
its
wisdom
passed
on
january
of
this
year
the
fair
housing
act
of
covered
over
million
american
homes
and
apartments
the
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
in
that
act
should
be
remembered
and
it
should
be
vigorously
enforced
throughout
this
land
i
believe
we
should
also
extend
the
vital
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
for
another
years
in
the
safe
streets
act
of
congress
determined
to
assist
state
and
local
governments
in
reducing
the
incidence
of
crime
this
year
i
am
proposing
that
the
congress
provide
the
full
million
that
the
congress
last
year
authorized
to
do
just
that
i
hope
the
congress
will
put
the
money
where
the
authorization
is
i
believe
this
is
an
essential
contribution
to
justice
and
to
public
order
in
the
united
states
i
hope
these
grants
can
be
made
to
the
states
and
they
can
be
used
effectively
to
reduce
the
crime
rate
in
this
country
but
all
of
this
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
total
effort
that
must
be
madei
think
chiefly
by
the
local
governments
throughout
the
nationif
we
expect
to
reduce
the
toll
of
crime
that
we
all
detest
frankly
as
i
leave
the
office
of
the
presidency
one
of
my
greatest
disappointments
is
our
failure
to
secure
passage
of
a
licensing
and
registration
act
for
firearms
i
think
if
we
had
passed
that
act
it
would
have
reduced
the
incidence
of
crime
i
believe
that
the
congress
s
hould
adopt
such
a
law
and
i
hope
that
it
will
at
a
not
too
distant
date
in
order
to
meet
our
longstanding
commitment
to
make
government
as
efficient
as
possible
i
believe
that
we
should
reorganize
our
postal
system
along
the
lines
of
the
kappel
report
footnote
frederick
r
kappel
chairman
of
the
commission
on
executive
legislative
and
judicial
salaries
i
hope
we
can
all
agree
that
public
service
should
never
impose
an
unreasonable
financial
sacrifice
on
able
men
and
women
who
want
to
serve
their
country
i
believe
that
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
on
executive
legislative
and
judicial
salaries
are
generally
sound
later
this
week
i
shall
submit
a
special
message
which
i
reviewed
with
the
leadership
this
evening
containing
a
proposal
that
has
been
reduced
and
has
modified
the
commissions
recommendation
to
some
extent
on
the
congressional
salaries
for
members
of
congress
i
will
recommend
the
basic
compensation
not
of
the
unanimously
recommended
by
the
kappel
commission
and
the
other
distinguished
members
but
i
shall
reduce
that
to
i
will
suggest
that
congress
appropriate
a
very
small
additional
allowance
for
official
expenses
so
that
members
will
not
be
required
to
use
their
salary
increase
for
essential
official
business
i
would
have
submitted
the
commissions
recommendations
except
the
advice
that
i
received
from
the
leadershipand
you
usually
are
consulted
about
matters
that
affect
the
congresswas
that
the
congress
would
not
accept
the
recommendation
and
if
i
expected
my
recommendation
to
be
seriously
considered
i
should
make
substantial
reductions
that
is
the
only
reason
i
didnt
go
along
with
the
kappel
report
in
i
recommended
to
the
congress
a
fair
and
impartial
random
selection
system
for
the
draft
i
submit
it
again
tonight
for
your
most
respectful
consideration
i
know
that
all
of
us
recognize
that
most
of
the
things
we
do
to
meet
all
of
these
commitments
i
talk
about
will
cost
money
if
we
maintain
the
strong
rate
of
growth
that
we
have
had
in
this
country
for
the
past
years
i
think
we
shall
generate
the
resources
that
we
need
to
meet
these
commitments
we
have
already
been
able
to
increase
our
support
for
major
social
programsalthough
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
not
being
able
to
do
anything
on
the
home
front
because
of
vietnam
but
we
have
been
able
in
the
last
years
to
increase
our
commitments
for
such
things
as
health
and
education
from
billion
in
to
billion
in
the
coming
fiscal
year
that
is
more
than
double
that
is
more
than
it
has
ever
been
increased
in
the
years
of
this
republic
notwithstanding
vietnam
we
must
continue
to
budget
our
resources
and
budget
them
responsibly
in
a
way
that
will
preserve
our
prosperity
and
will
strengthen
our
dollar
greater
revenues
and
the
reduced
federal
spending
required
by
congress
last
year
have
changed
the
budgetary
picture
dramatically
since
last
january
when
we
made
our
estimates
at
that
time
you
will
remember
that
we
estimated
we
would
have
a
deficit
of
billion
well
i
am
glad
to
report
to
you
tonight
that
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
this
june
we
are
going
to
have
not
a
deficit
but
we
are
going
to
have
a
billion
surplus
you
will
receive
the
budget
tomorrow
the
budget
for
the
next
fiscal
year
that
begins
july
which
you
will
want
to
examine
very
carefully
in
the
days
aheadwill
provide
a
billion
surplus
this
budget
anticipates
the
extension
of
the
surtax
that
congress
enacted
last
year
i
have
communicated
with
the
presidentelect
mr
nixon
in
connection
with
this
policy
of
continuing
the
surtax
for
the
time
being
i
want
to
tell
you
that
both
of
us
want
to
see
it
removed
just
as
soon
as
circumstances
will
permit
but
the
presidentelect
has
told
me
that
he
has
concluded
that
until
his
administration
and
this
congress
can
examine
the
appropriation
bills
and
each
item
in
the
budget
and
can
ascertain
that
the
facts
justify
permitting
the
surtax
to
expire
or
to
be
reduced
he
mr
nixon
will
support
my
recommendation
that
the
surtax
be
continued
americans
i
believe
are
united
in
the
hope
that
the
paris
talks
will
bring
an
early
peace
to
vietnam
and
if
our
hopes
for
an
early
settlement
of
the
war
are
realized
then
our
military
expenditures
can
be
reduced
and
very
substantial
savings
can
be
made
to
be
used
for
other
desirable
purposes
as
the
congress
may
determine
in
any
event
i
think
it
is
imperative
that
we
do
all
that
we
responsibly
can
to
resist
inflation
while
maintaining
our
prosperity
i
think
all
americans
know
that
our
prosperity
is
broad
and
it
is
deep
and
it
has
brought
record
profits
the
highest
in
our
history
and
record
wages
our
gross
national
product
has
grown
more
in
the
last
years
than
any
other
period
in
our
nations
history
our
wages
have
been
the
highest
our
profits
have
been
the
best
this
prosperity
has
enabled
millions
to
escape
the
poverty
that
they
would
have
otherwise
had
the
last
few
years
i
think
also
you
will
be
very
glad
to
hear
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
informs
me
tonight
that
in
in
our
balance
of
payments
we
have
achieved
a
surplus
it
appears
that
we
have
in
fact
done
better
this
year
than
we
have
done
in
any
year
in
this
regard
since
the
year
the
quest
for
a
durable
peace
i
think
has
absorbed
every
administration
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
it
has
required
us
to
seek
a
limitation
of
arms
races
not
only
among
the
superpowers
but
among
the
smaller
nations
as
well
we
have
joined
in
the
test
ban
treaty
of
the
outer
space
treaty
of
and
the
treaty
against
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
in
this
latter
agreementthe
nonproliferation
treatyis
now
pending
in
the
senate
and
it
has
been
pending
there
since
last
july
in
my
opinion
delay
in
ratifying
it
is
not
going
to
be
helpful
to
the
cause
of
peace
america
took
the
lead
in
negotiating
this
treaty
and
america
should
now
take
steps
to
have
it
approved
at
the
earliest
possible
date
until
a
way
can
be
found
to
scale
down
the
level
of
arms
among
the
superpowers
mankind
cannot
view
the
future
without
fear
and
great
apprehension
so
i
believe
that
we
should
resume
the
talks
with
the
soviet
union
about
limiting
offensive
and
defensive
missile
systems
i
think
they
would
already
have
been
resumed
except
for
czechoslovakia
and
our
election
this
year
it
was
more
than
years
ago
that
we
embarked
on
a
program
of
trying
to
aid
the
developing
nations
we
knew
then
that
we
could
not
live
in
good
conscience
as
a
rich
enclave
on
an
earth
that
was
seething
in
misery
during
these
years
there
have
been
great
advances
made
under
our
program
particularly
against
want
and
hunger
although
we
are
disappointed
at
the
appropriations
last
year
we
thought
they
were
woefully
inadequate
this
year
i
am
asking
for
adequate
funds
for
economic
assistance
in
the
hope
that
we
can
further
peace
throughout
the
world
i
think
we
must
continue
to
support
efforts
in
regional
cooperation
among
those
efforts
that
of
western
europe
has
a
very
special
place
in
americas
concern
the
only
course
that
is
going
to
permit
europe
to
play
the
great
world
role
that
its
resources
permit
is
to
go
forward
to
unity
i
think
america
remains
ready
to
work
with
a
united
europe
to
work
as
a
partner
on
the
basis
of
equality
for
the
future
the
quest
for
peace
i
believe
requires
that
we
maintain
the
liberal
trade
policies
that
have
helped
us
become
the
leading
nation
in
world
trade
that
we
strengthen
the
international
monetary
system
as
an
instrument
of
world
prosperity
and
that
we
seek
areas
of
agreement
with
the
soviet
union
where
the
interests
of
both
nations
and
the
interests
of
world
peace
are
properly
served
the
strained
relationship
between
us
and
the
worlds
leading
communist
power
has
not
endedespecially
in
the
light
of
the
brutal
invasion
of
czechoslovakia
but
totalitarianism
is
no
less
odious
to
us
because
we
are
able
to
reach
some
accommodation
that
reduces
the
danger
of
world
catastrophe
what
we
do
we
do
in
the
interest
of
peace
in
the
world
we
earnestly
hope
that
time
will
bring
a
russia
that
is
less
afraid
of
diversity
and
individual
freedom
the
quest
for
peace
tonight
continues
in
vietnam
and
in
the
paris
talks
i
regret
more
than
any
of
you
know
that
it
has
not
been
possible
to
restore
peace
to
south
vietnam
the
prospects
i
think
for
peace
are
better
today
than
at
any
time
since
north
vietnam
began
its
invasion
with
its
regular
forces
more
than
years
ago
the
free
nations
of
asia
know
what
they
were
not
sure
of
at
that
time
that
america
cares
about
their
freedom
and
it
also
cares
about
americas
own
vital
interests
in
asia
and
throughout
the
pacific
the
north
vietnamese
know
that
they
cannot
achieve
their
aggressive
purposes
by
force
there
may
be
hard
fighting
before
a
settlement
is
reached
but
i
can
assure
you
it
will
yield
no
victory
to
the
communist
cause
i
cannot
speak
to
you
tonight
about
vietnam
without
paying
a
very
personal
tribute
to
the
men
who
have
carried
the
battle
out
there
for
all
of
us
i
have
been
honored
to
be
their
commander
in
chief
the
nation
owes
them
its
unstinting
support
while
the
battle
continuesand
its
enduring
gratitude
when
their
service
is
done
finally
the
quest
for
stable
peace
in
the
middle
east
goes
on
in
many
capitals
tonight
america
fully
supports
the
unanimous
resolution
of
the
un
security
council
which
points
the
way
there
must
be
a
settlement
of
the
armed
hostility
that
exists
in
that
region
of
the
world
today
it
is
a
threat
not
only
to
israel
and
to
all
the
arab
states
but
it
is
a
threat
to
every
one
of
us
and
to
the
entire
world
as
well
now
my
friends
in
congress
i
want
to
conclude
with
a
few
very
personal
words
to
you
i
rejected
and
rejected
and
then
finally
accepted
the
congressional
leaderships
invitation
to
come
here
to
speak
this
farewell
to
you
in
person
tonight
i
did
that
for
two
reasons
one
was
philosophical
i
wanted
to
give
you
my
judgment
as
i
saw
it
on
some
of
the
issues
before
our
nation
as
i
view
them
before
i
leave
the
other
was
just
pure
sentimental
most
all
of
my
life
as
a
public
official
has
been
spent
here
in
this
building
for
yearssince
i
worked
on
that
gallery
as
a
doorkeeper
in
the
house
of
representa
tivesi
have
known
these
halls
and
i
have
known
most
of
the
men
pretty
well
who
walked
them
i
know
the
questions
that
you
face
i
know
the
conflicts
that
you
endure
i
know
the
ideals
that
you
seek
to
serve
i
left
here
first
to
become
vice
president
and
then
to
become
in
a
moment
of
tragedy
the
president
of
the
united
states
my
term
of
office
has
been
marked
by
a
series
of
challenges
both
at
home
and
throughout
the
world
in
meeting
some
of
these
challenges
the
nation
has
found
a
new
confidence
in
meeting
others
it
knew
turbulence
and
doubt
and
fear
and
hate
throughout
this
time
i
have
been
sustained
by
my
faith
in
representative
democracya
faith
that
i
had
learned
here
in
this
capitol
building
as
an
employee
and
as
a
congressman
and
as
a
senator
i
believe
deeply
in
the
ultimate
purposes
of
this
nationdescribed
by
the
constitution
tempered
by
history
embodied
in
progressive
laws
and
given
life
by
men
and
women
that
have
been
elected
to
serve
their
fellow
citizens
now
for
most
demanding
years
in
the
white
house
i
have
been
strengthened
by
the
counsel
and
the
cooperation
of
two
great
former
presidents
harry
s
truman
and
dwight
david
eisenhower
i
have
been
guided
by
the
memory
of
my
pleasant
and
close
association
with
the
beloved
john
f
kennedy
and
with
our
greatest
modern
legislator
speaker
sam
rayburn
i
have
been
assisted
by
my
friend
every
step
of
the
way
vice
president
hubert
humphrey
i
am
so
grateful
that
i
have
been
supported
daily
by
the
loyalty
of
speaker
mccormack
and
majority
leader
albert
i
have
benefited
from
the
wisdom
of
senator
mike
mansfield
and
i
am
sure
that
i
have
avoided
many
dangerous
pitfalls
by
the
good
commonsense
counsel
of
the
president
pro
tem
of
the
senate
senator
richard
brevard
russell
i
have
received
the
most
generous
cooperation
from
the
leaders
of
the
republican
party
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
senator
dirksen
and
congressman
gerald
ford
the
minority
leader
no
president
should
ask
for
more
although
i
did
upon
occasions
but
few
presidents
have
ever
been
blessed
with
so
much
presidentelect
nixon
in
the
days
ahead
is
going
to
need
your
understanding
just
as
i
did
and
he
is
entitled
to
have
it
i
hope
every
member
will
remember
that
the
burdens
he
will
bear
as
our
president
will
be
borne
for
all
of
us
each
of
us
should
try
not
to
increase
these
burdens
for
the
sake
of
narrow
personal
or
partisan
advantage
now
it
is
time
to
leave
i
hope
it
may
be
said
a
hundred
years
from
now
that
by
working
together
we
helped
to
make
our
country
more
just
more
just
for
all
of
its
people
as
well
as
to
insure
and
guarantee
the
blessings
of
liberty
for
all
of
our
posterity
that
is
what
i
hope
but
i
believe
that
at
least
it
will
be
said
that
we
tried

mr
speaker
mr
president
members
of
the
congress
and
my
fellow
americans
i
was
thinking
as
i
was
walking
down
the
aisle
tonight
of
what
sam
rayburn
told
me
many
years
ago
the
congress
always
extends
a
very
warm
welcome
to
the
presidentas
he
comes
in
thank
all
of
you
very
very
much
i
have
come
once
again
to
this
chamberthe
home
of
our
democracyto
give
you
as
the
constitution
requires
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
i
report
to
you
that
our
country
is
challenged
at
home
and
abroad
that
it
is
our
will
that
is
being
tried
not
our
strength
our
sense
of
purpose
not
our
ability
to
achieve
a
better
america
that
we
have
the
strength
to
meet
our
every
challenge
the
physical
strength
to
hold
the
course
of
decency
and
compassion
at
home
and
the
moral
strength
to
support
the
cause
of
peace
in
the
world
and
i
report
to
you
that
i
believe
with
abiding
conviction
that
this
peoplenurtured
by
their
deep
faith
tutored
by
their
hard
lessons
moved
by
their
high
aspirationshave
the
will
to
meet
the
trials
that
these
times
impose
since
i
reported
to
you
last
january
three
elections
have
been
held
in
vietnamin
the
midst
of
war
and
under
the
constant
threat
of
violence
a
president
a
vice
president
a
house
and
senate
and
village
officials
have
been
chosen
by
popular
contested
ballot
the
enemy
has
been
defeated
in
battle
after
battle
the
number
of
south
vietnamese
living
in
areas
under
government
protection
tonight
has
grown
by
more
than
a
million
since
january
of
last
year
these
are
all
marks
of
progress
yet
the
enemy
continues
to
pour
men
and
material
across
frontiers
and
into
battle
despite
his
continuous
heavy
losses
he
continues
to
hope
that
americas
will
to
persevere
can
be
broken
wellhe
is
wrong
america
will
persevere
our
patience
and
our
perseverance
will
match
our
power
aggression
will
never
prevail
but
our
goal
is
peaceand
peace
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
right
now
we
are
exploring
the
meaning
of
hanois
recent
statement
there
is
no
mystery
about
the
questions
which
must
be
answered
before
the
bombing
is
stopped
we
believe
that
any
talks
should
follow
the
san
antonio
formula
that
i
stated
last
september
which
said
the
bombing
would
stop
immediately
if
talks
would
take
place
promptly
and
with
reasonable
hopes
that
they
would
be
productive
and
the
other
side
must
not
take
advantage
of
our
restraint
as
they
have
in
the
past
this
nation
simply
cannot
accept
anything
less
without
jeopardizing
the
lives
of
our
men
and
of
our
allies
if
a
basis
for
peace
talks
can
be
established
on
the
san
antonio
foundationsand
it
is
my
hope
and
my
prayer
that
they
canwe
would
consult
with
our
allies
and
with
the
other
side
to
see
if
a
complete
cessation
of
hostilitiesa
really
true
ceasefirecould
be
made
the
first
order
of
business
i
will
report
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
results
of
these
explorations
to
the
american
people
i
have
just
recently
returned
from
a
very
fruitful
visit
and
talks
with
his
holiness
the
pope
and
i
share
his
hopeas
he
expressed
it
earlier
todaythat
both
sides
will
extend
themselves
in
an
effort
to
bring
an
end
to
the
war
in
vietnam
i
have
today
assured
him
that
we
and
our
allies
will
do
our
full
part
to
bring
this
about
since
i
spoke
to
you
last
january
other
events
have
occurred
that
have
major
consequences
for
world
peace
the
kennedy
round
achieved
the
greatest
reduction
in
tariff
barriers
in
all
the
history
of
trade
negotiations
the
nations
of
latin
america
at
punta
del
este
resolved
to
move
toward
economic
integration
in
asia
the
nations
from
korea
and
japan
to
indonesia
and
singapore
worked
behind
americas
shield
to
strengthen
their
economies
and
to
broaden
their
political
cooperation
in
africa
from
which
the
distinguished
vice
president
has
just
returned
he
reports
to
me
that
there
is
a
spirit
of
regional
cooperation
that
is
beginning
to
take
hold
in
very
practical
ways
these
events
we
all
welcomed
yet
since
i
last
reported
to
you
we
and
the
world
have
been
confronted
by
a
number
of
crises
during
the
arabisraeli
war
last
june
the
hot
line
between
washington
and
moscow
was
used
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
a
ceasefire
was
achieved
without
a
major
power
confrontation
now
the
nations
of
the
middle
east
have
the
opportunity
to
cooperate
with
ambassador
jarrings
un
mission
and
they
have
the
responsibility
to
find
the
terms
of
living
together
in
stable
peace
and
dignity
and
we
shall
do
all
in
our
power
to
help
them
achieve
that
result
not
far
from
this
scene
of
conflict
a
crisis
flared
on
cyprus
involving
two
peoples
who
are
americas
friends
greece
and
turkey
our
very
able
representative
mr
cyrus
vance
and
others
helped
to
ease
this
tension
turmoil
continues
on
the
mainland
of
china
after
a
year
of
violent
disruption
the
radical
extremism
of
their
government
has
isolated
the
chinese
people
behind
their
own
borders
the
united
states
however
remains
willing
to
permit
the
travel
of
journalists
to
both
our
countries
to
undertake
cultural
and
educational
exchanges
and
to
talk
about
the
exchange
of
basic
food
crop
materials
since
i
spoke
to
you
last
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
have
taken
several
important
steps
toward
the
goal
of
international
cooperation
as
you
will
remember
i
met
with
chairman
kosygin
at
glassboro
and
we
achieved
if
not
accord
at
least
a
clearer
understanding
of
our
respective
positions
after
days
of
meeting
because
we
believe
the
nuclear
danger
must
be
narrowed
we
have
worked
with
the
soviet
union
and
with
other
nations
to
reach
an
agreement
that
will
halt
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
on
the
basis
of
communications
from
ambassador
fisher
in
geneva
this
afternoon
i
am
encouraged
to
believe
that
a
draft
treaty
can
be
laid
before
the
conference
in
geneva
in
the
very
near
future
i
hope
to
be
able
to
present
that
treaty
to
the
senate
this
year
for
the
senates
approval
we
achieved
in
a
consular
treaty
with
the
soviets
the
first
commercial
air
agreement
between
the
two
countries
and
a
treaty
banning
weapons
in
outer
space
we
shall
sign
and
submit
to
the
senate
shortly
a
new
treaty
with
the
soviets
and
with
others
for
the
protection
of
astronauts
serious
differences
still
remain
between
us
yet
in
these
relations
we
have
made
some
progress
since
vienna
the
berlin
wall
and
the
cuban
missile
crisis
but
despite
this
progress
we
must
maintain
a
military
force
that
is
capable
of
deterring
any
threat
to
this
nations
security
whatever
the
mode
of
aggression
our
choices
must
not
be
confined
to
total
waror
to
total
acquiescence
we
have
such
a
military
force
today
we
shall
maintain
it
i
wishwith
all
of
my
heartthat
the
expenditures
that
are
necessary
to
build
and
to
protect
our
power
could
all
be
devoted
to
the
programs
of
peace
but
until
world
conditions
permit
and
until
peace
is
assured
americas
mightand
americas
bravest
sons
who
wear
our
nations
uniformmust
continue
to
stand
guard
for
all
of
usas
they
gallantly
do
tonight
in
vietnam
and
other
places
in
the
world
yet
neither
great
weapons
nor
individual
courage
can
provide
the
conditions
of
peace
for
two
decades
america
has
committed
itself
against
the
tyranny
of
want
and
ignorance
in
the
world
that
threatens
the
peace
we
shall
sustain
that
commitment
this
year
i
shall
propose
that
we
launch
with
other
nations
an
exploration
of
the
ocean
depths
to
tap
its
wealth
and
its
energy
and
its
abundance
that
we
contribute
our
fair
share
to
a
major
expansion
of
the
international
development
association
and
to
increase
the
resources
of
the
asian
development
bank
that
we
adopt
a
prudent
aid
program
rooted
in
the
principle
of
selfhelp
that
we
renew
and
extend
the
food
for
freedom
program
our
food
programs
have
already
helped
millions
avoid
the
horrors
of
famine
but
unless
the
rapid
growth
of
population
in
developing
countries
is
slowed
the
gap
between
rich
and
poor
will
widen
steadily
governments
in
the
developing
countries
must
take
such
facts
into
consideration
we
in
the
united
states
are
prepared
to
help
assist
them
in
those
efforts
but
we
must
also
improve
the
lives
of
children
already
born
in
the
villages
and
towns
and
cities
on
this
earth
they
can
be
taught
by
great
teachers
through
space
communications
and
the
miracle
of
satellite
televisionand
we
are
going
to
bring
to
bear
every
resource
of
mind
and
technology
to
help
make
this
dream
come
true
let
me
speak
now
about
some
matters
here
at
home
tonight
our
nation
is
accomplishing
more
for
its
people
than
has
ever
been
accomplished
before
americans
are
prosperous
as
men
have
never
been
in
recorded
history
yet
there
is
in
the
land
a
certain
restlessnessa
questioning
the
total
of
our
nations
annual
production
is
now
above
billion
for
months
this
nation
has
been
on
a
steady
upward
trend
of
growth
all
about
them
most
american
families
can
see
the
evidence
of
growing
abundance
higher
paychecks
humming
factories
new
cars
moving
down
new
highways
more
and
more
families
own
their
own
homes
equipped
with
more
than
million
television
sets
a
new
college
is
founded
every
week
today
more
than
half
of
the
high
school
graduates
go
on
to
college
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
fathers
and
mothers
who
never
completed
grammar
schoolwho
will
see
their
children
graduate
from
college
why
then
this
restlessness
because
when
a
great
ship
cuts
through
the
sea
the
waters
are
always
stirred
and
troubled
and
our
ship
is
moving
it
is
moving
through
troubled
and
new
waters
it
is
moving
toward
new
and
better
shores
we
ask
now
not
how
can
we
achieve
abundancebut
how
shall
we
use
our
abundance
not
is
there
abundance
enough
for
allbut
how
can
all
share
in
our
abundance
while
we
have
accomplished
much
much
remains
for
us
to
meet
and
much
remains
for
us
to
master
in
some
areas
the
jobless
rate
is
still
three
or
four
times
the
national
average
violence
has
shown
its
face
in
some
of
our
cities
crime
increases
on
our
streets
income
for
farm
workers
remains
far
behind
that
for
urban
workers
and
parity
for
our
farmers
who
produce
our
food
is
still
just
a
hopenot
an
achievement
new
housing
construction
is
far
less
than
we
needto
assure
dec
ent
shelter
for
every
family
hospital
and
medical
costs
are
high
and
they
are
rising
many
riversand
the
air
in
many
citiesremain
badly
polluted
and
our
citizens
suffer
from
breathing
that
air
we
have
lived
with
conditions
like
these
for
many
many
years
but
much
that
we
once
accepted
as
inevitable
we
now
find
absolutely
intolerable
in
our
cities
last
summer
we
saw
how
wide
is
the
gulf
for
some
americans
between
the
promise
and
the
reality
of
our
society
we
know
that
we
cannot
change
all
of
this
in
a
day
it
represents
the
bitter
consequences
of
more
than
three
centuries
but
the
issue
is
not
whether
we
can
change
this
the
issue
is
whether
we
will
change
this
well
i
know
we
can
and
i
believe
we
will
this
then
is
the
work
we
should
do
in
the
months
that
are
ahead
of
us
in
this
congress
the
first
essential
is
more
jobs
useful
jobs
for
tens
of
thousands
who
can
become
productive
and
can
pay
their
own
way
our
economy
has
created
million
new
jobs
in
the
past
years
it
is
adding
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
new
jobs
this
year
through
programs
passed
by
the
congress
job
training
is
being
given
tonight
to
more
than
a
million
americans
in
this
country
this
year
the
time
has
come
when
we
must
get
to
those
who
are
last
in
linethe
hardcore
unemployedthe
hardest
to
reach
employment
officials
estimate
that
of
these
persons
are
now
unemployed
in
the
major
cities
of
america
our
objective
is
to
place
these
in
private
industry
jobs
within
the
next
years
to
do
this
i
propose
a
billion
manpower
program
in
the
coming
fiscal
yeara
percent
increase
over
the
current
year
most
of
this
increase
will
be
used
to
start
a
new
partnership
between
government
and
private
industry
to
train
and
to
hire
the
hardcore
unemployed
persons
i
know
of
no
task
before
us
of
more
importance
to
us
to
the
country
or
to
our
future
another
essential
is
to
rebuild
our
cities
last
year
the
congress
authorized
million
for
the
model
cities
program
i
requested
the
full
amount
of
that
authorization
to
help
meet
the
crisis
in
the
cities
of
america
but
the
congress
appropriated
only
millionless
than
half
this
year
i
urge
the
congress
to
honor
my
request
for
model
cities
funds
to
rebuild
the
centers
of
american
cities
by
granting
us
the
full
amount
that
you
in
the
congress
authorized
billion
the
next
essential
is
more
housingand
more
housing
now
surely
a
nation
that
can
go
to
the
moon
can
place
a
decent
home
within
the
reach
of
its
families
therefore
we
must
call
together
the
resources
of
industry
and
labor
to
start
building
housing
units
for
low
and
middleincome
families
next
yearthat
is
three
times
more
than
this
year
we
must
make
it
possible
for
thousands
of
families
to
become
homeowners
not
rentpayers
i
propose
for
the
consideration
of
this
congress
a
year
campaign
to
build
million
new
housing
units
for
low
and
middleincome
families
six
million
units
in
the
next
years
we
have
built
the
last
years
better
health
for
our
childrenall
of
our
childrenis
essential
if
we
are
to
have
a
better
america
last
year
medicare
medicaid
and
other
new
programs
that
you
passed
in
the
congress
brought
better
health
to
more
than
million
americans
american
medicinewith
the
very
strong
support
and
cooperation
of
public
resourceshas
produced
a
phenomenal
decline
in
the
death
rate
from
many
of
the
dread
diseases
but
it
is
a
shocking
fact
that
in
saving
the
lives
of
babies
america
ranks
th
among
the
nations
of
the
world
and
among
children
crippling
defects
are
often
discovered
too
late
for
any
corrective
action
this
is
a
tragedy
that
americans
can
and
americans
should
prevent
i
shall
therefore
propose
to
the
congress
a
child
health
program
to
provide
over
the
next
years
for
families
unable
to
afford
itaccess
to
health
services
from
prenatal
care
of
the
mother
through
the
childs
first
year
when
we
do
that
you
will
find
it
is
the
best
investment
we
ever
made
because
we
will
get
these
diseases
in
their
infancy
and
we
will
find
a
cure
in
a
great
many
instances
that
we
can
never
find
by
overcrowding
our
hospitals
when
they
are
grown
now
when
we
act
to
advance
the
consumers
cause
i
think
we
help
every
american
last
year
with
very
little
fanfare
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
moved
in
that
field
we
enacted
the
wholesome
meat
act
the
flammable
fabrics
act
the
product
safety
commission
and
a
law
to
improve
clinical
laboratories
and
now
i
think
the
time
has
come
to
complete
our
unfinished
work
the
senate
has
already
passed
the
truthinlending
bill
the
fire
safety
bill
and
the
pipeline
safety
laws
tonight
i
plead
with
the
house
to
immediately
act
upon
these
measures
and
i
hope
take
favorable
action
upon
all
of
them
i
call
upon
the
congress
to
enact
without
delay
the
remainder
of
the
vital
consumer
protection
laws
that
i
submitted
to
the
congress
last
year
i
also
urge
final
action
on
a
measure
that
is
already
passed
by
the
house
to
guard
against
fraud
and
manipulation
in
the
nations
commodity
exchange
market
these
measures
are
a
pledge
to
our
peopleto
keep
them
safe
in
their
homes
and
at
work
and
to
give
them
a
fair
deal
in
the
marketplace
and
i
think
we
must
do
more
i
propose
new
powers
for
the
federal
trade
commission
to
stop
those
who
defraud
and
who
swindle
our
public
new
safeguards
to
insure
the
quality
of
fish
and
poultry
and
the
safety
of
our
community
water
supplies
a
major
study
of
automobile
insurance
protection
against
hazardous
radiation
from
television
sets
and
other
electronic
equipment
and
to
give
the
consumer
a
stronger
voice
i
plan
to
appoint
a
consumer
counsel
in
the
justice
departmenta
lawyer
for
the
american
consumerto
work
directly
under
the
attorney
general
to
serve
the
presidents
special
assistant
for
consumer
affairs
and
to
serve
the
consumers
of
this
land
this
congressdemocrats
and
republicanscan
earn
the
thanks
of
history
we
can
make
this
truly
a
new
day
for
the
american
consumer
and
by
giving
him
this
protection
we
can
live
in
history
as
the
consumerconscious
congress
so
let
us
get
on
with
the
work
let
us
act
soon
we
at
every
level
of
the
government
state
local
federal
know
that
the
american
people
have
had
enough
of
rising
crime
and
lawlessness
in
this
country
they
recognize
that
law
enforcement
is
first
the
duty
of
local
police
and
local
government
they
recognize
that
the
frontline
headquarters
against
crime
is
in
the
home
the
church
the
city
hall
and
the
county
courthouse
and
the
statehousenot
in
the
farremoved
national
capital
of
washington
but
the
people
also
recognize
that
the
national
government
can
and
the
national
government
should
help
the
cities
and
the
states
in
their
war
on
crime
to
the
full
extent
of
its
resources
and
its
constitutional
authority
and
this
we
shall
do
this
does
not
mean
a
national
police
force
it
does
mean
help
and
financial
support
to
develop
state
and
local
master
plans
to
combat
crime
to
provide
better
training
and
better
pay
for
police
and
to
bring
the
most
advanced
technology
to
the
war
on
crime
in
every
city
and
every
county
in
america
there
is
no
more
urgent
business
before
this
congress
than
to
pass
the
safe
streets
act
this
year
that
i
proposed
last
year
that
law
will
provide
these
required
funds
they
are
so
critically
needed
that
i
have
doubled
my
request
under
this
act
to
million
in
fiscal
and
i
urge
the
congress
to
stop
the
trade
in
mailorder
murder
to
stop
it
this
year
by
adopting
a
proper
gun
control
law
this
year
i
will
propose
a
drug
control
act
to
provide
stricter
penalties
for
those
who
traffic
in
lsd
and
other
dangerous
drugs
with
our
people
i
will
ask
for
more
vigorous
enforcement
of
all
of
our
drug
laws
by
increasing
the
number
of
federal
drug
and
narcotics
control
officials
by
more
than
percent
the
time
has
come
to
stop
the
sale
of
slavery
to
the
young
i
also
request
you
to
give
us
funds
to
add
immediately
assistant
united
states
attorneys
throughout
the
land
to
help
prosecute
our
criminal
laws
we
have
increased
our
judiciary
by
percent
and
we
have
increased
our
prosecutors
by
percent
the
dockets
are
full
of
cases
because
we
dont
have
assistant
district
attorneys
to
go
before
the
federal
judge
and
handle
them
we
start
these
young
lawyers
at
a
year
and
the
docket
is
clogged
because
we
dont
have
authority
to
hire
more
of
them
i
ask
the
congress
for
authority
to
hire
more
these
young
men
will
give
special
attention
to
this
drug
abuse
too
finally
i
ask
you
to
add
fbi
agents
to
strengthen
law
enforcement
in
the
nation
and
to
protect
the
individual
rights
of
every
citizen
a
moment
ago
i
spoke
of
despair
and
frustrated
hopes
in
the
cities
where
the
fires
of
disorder
burned
last
summer
we
canand
in
time
we
willchange
that
despair
into
confidence
and
change
those
frustrations
into
achievements
but
violence
will
never
bring
progress
we
can
make
progress
only
by
attacking
the
causes
of
violence
and
only
where
there
is
civil
order
founded
on
justice
today
we
are
helping
local
officials
improve
their
capacity
to
deal
promptly
with
disorders
those
who
preach
disorder
and
those
who
preach
violence
must
know
that
local
authorities
are
able
to
resist
them
swiftly
to
resist
them
sternly
and
to
resist
them
decisively
i
shall
recommend
other
actions
to
raise
the
farmers
income
by
establishing
a
security
commodity
reserve
that
will
protect
the
market
from
pricedepressing
stocks
and
protect
the
consumer
from
food
scarcity
i
shall
recommend
programs
to
help
farmers
bargain
more
effectively
for
fair
prices
i
shall
recommend
programs
for
new
air
safety
measures
measures
to
stem
the
rising
costs
of
medical
care
legislation
to
encourage
our
returning
veterans
to
devote
themselves
to
careers
in
community
service
such
as
teaching
and
being
firemen
and
joining
our
police
force
and
our
law
enforcement
officials
i
shall
recommend
programs
to
strengthen
and
finance
our
antipollution
efforts
fully
funding
all
of
the
billion
poverty
program
that
you
in
the
congress
had
just
authorized
in
order
to
bring
opportunity
to
those
who
have
been
left
far
behind
i
shall
recommend
an
educational
opportunity
act
to
speed
up
our
drive
to
break
down
the
financial
barr
iers
that
are
separating
our
young
people
from
college
i
shall
also
urge
the
congress
to
act
on
several
other
vital
pending
billsespecially
the
civil
rights
measuresfair
jury
trials
protection
of

all
the

for

better
and
for
a
more
beautiful
america
next
month
well
begin
our
th
year
of
uninterrupted
prosperity
the
economic
outlook
for
this
year
is
one
of
steady
growthif
we
are
vigilant
true
there
are
some
clouds
on
the
horizon
prices
are
rising
interest
rates
have
passed
the
peak
of
and
if
there
is
continued
inaction
on
the
tax
bill
they
will
climb
even
higher
i
warn
the
congress
and
the
nation
tonight
that
this
failure
to
act
on
the
tax
bill
will
sweep
us
into
an
accelerating
spiral
of
price
increases
a
slump
in
homebuilding
and
a
continuing
erosion
of
the
american
dollar
this
would
be
a
tragedy
for
every
american
family
and
i
predict
that
if
this
happens
they
will
all
let
us
know
about
it
wethose
of
us
in
the
executive
branch
in
the
congress
and
the
leaders
of
labor
and
businessmust
do
everything
we
can
to
prevent
that
kind
of
misfortune
under
the
new
budget
the
expenditures
for
will
increase
by
billion
receipts
will
increase
by
billion
including
the
added
tax
revenues
virtually
all
of
this
expenditure
increase
represents
the
mandatory
cost
of
our
defense
efforts
billion
increased
interest
almost
billion
or
mandatory
payments
under
laws
passed
by
congresssuch
as
those
provided
in
the
social
security
act
that
you
passed
in
and
to
medicare
and
medicaid
beneficiaries
veterans
and
farmers
of
about
billion
and
the
additional
billion
million
next
year
for
the
pay
increases
that
you
passed
in
military
and
civilian
pay
that
makes
up
the
billion
that
is
added
to
the
budget
with
few
exceptions
very
few
we
are
holding
the
fiscal
budget
to
last
years
level
outside
of
those
mandatory
and
required
increases
a
presidential
commission
composed
of
distinguished
congressional
fiscal
leaders
and
other
prominent
americans
recommended
this
year
that
we
adopt
a
new
budget
approach
i
am
carrying
out
their
recommendations
in
this
years
budget
this
budget
therefore
for
the
first
time
accurately
covers
all
federal
expenditures
and
all
federal
receipts
including
for
the
first
time
in
one
budget
billion
from
the
social
security
medicare
highway
and
other
trust
funds
the
fiscal
budget
has
expenditures
of
approximately
billion
with
total
estimated
revenues
including
the
tax
bill
of
about
billion
if
the
congress
enacts
the
tax
increase
we
will
reduce
the
budget
deficit
by
some
billion
the
war
in
vietnam
is
costing
us
about
billion
and
we
are
asking
for
about
billion
in
taxesand
if
we
get
that
billion
tax
bill
we
will
reduce
the
deficit
from
about
billion
in
to
about
billion
in
now
this
is
a
tight
budget
it
follows
the
reduction
that
i
made
in
cooperation
with
the
congressa
reduction
made
after
you
had
reviewed
every
appropriations
bill
and
reduced
the
appropriations
by
some
or
billion
and
expenditures
by
billion
we
conferred
together
and
i
recommended
to
the
congress
and
you
subsequently
approved
taking
percent
from
payrolls
and
percent
from
controllable
expenditures
we
therefore
reduced
appropriations
almost
billion
last
session
and
expenditures
over
billion
now
that
was
in
the
budget
last
year
i
ask
the
congress
to
recognize
that
there
are
certain
selected
programs
that
meet
the
nations
most
urgent
needs
and
they
have
increased
we
have
insisted
that
decreases
in
very
desirable
but
less
urgent
programs
be
made
before
we
would
approve
any
increases
so
i
ask
the
congress
tonight
to
hold
its
appropriations
to
the
budget
requests
and
to
act
responsibly
early
this
year
by
enacting
the
tax
surcharge
which
for
the
average
american
individual
amounts
to
about
a
penny
out
of
each
dollars
income
this
tax
increase
would
yield
about
half
of
the
billion
per
year
that
we
returned
to
the
people
in
the
tax
reduction
bills
of
and
this
must
be
a
temporary
measure
which
expires
in
less
than
years
congress
can
repeal
it
sooner
if
the
need
has
passed
but
congress
can
never
repeal
inflation
the
leaders
of
american
business
and
the
leaders
of
american
laborthose
who
really
have
power
over
wages
and
pricesmust
act
responsibly
and
in
their
nations
interest
by
keeping
increases
in
line
with
productivity
if
our
recognized
leaders
do
not
do
this
they
and
those
for
whom
they
speak
and
all
of
us
are
going
to
suffer
very
serious
consequences
on
january
st
i
outlined
a
program
to
reduce
our
balance
of
payments
deficit
sharply
this
year
we
will
ask
the
congress
to
help
carry
out
those
parts
of
the
program
which
require
legislation
we
must
restore
equilibrium
to
our
balance
of
payments
we
must
also
strengthen
the
international
monetary
system
we
have
assured
the
world
that
americas
full
gold
stock
stands
behind
our
commitment
to
maintain
the
price
of
gold
at
an
ounce
we
must
back
this
commitment
by
legislating
now
to
free
our
gold
reserves
americans
traveling
more
than
any
other
people
in
history
took
billion
out
of
their
country
last
year
in
travel
costs
we
must
try
to
reduce
the
travel
deficit
that
we
have
of
more
than
billion
we
are
hoping
that
we
can
reduce
it
by
millionwithout
unduly
penalizing
the
travel
of
teachers
students
business
people
who
have
essential
and
necessary
travel
or
people
who
have
relatives
abroad
whom
they
want
to
see
even
with
this
reduction
of
million
the
american
people
will
still
be
traveling
more
overseas
than
they
did
in
or
or
any
other
year
in
their
history
if
we
act
together
as
i
hope
we
can
i
believe
we
can
continue
our
economic
expansion
which
has
already
broken
all
past
records
and
i
hope
that
we
can
continue
that
expansion
in
the
days
ahead
each
of
these
questions
i
have
discussed
with
you
tonight
is
a
question
of
policy
for
our
people
therefore
each
of
them
should
beand
doubtless
will
bedebated
by
candidates
for
public
office
this
year
i
hope
those
debates
will
be
marked
by
new
proposals
and
by
a
seriousness
that
matches
the
gravity
of
the
questions
themselves
these
are
not
appropriate
subjects
for
narrow
partisan
oratory
they
go
to
the
heart
of
what
we
americans
are
all
aboutall
of
us
democrats
and
republicans
tonight
i
have
spoken
of
some
of
the
goals
i
should
like
to
see
america
reach
many
of
them
can
be
achieved
this
yearothers
by
the
time
we
celebrate
our
nations
th
birthdaythe
bicentennial
of
our
independence
several
of
these
goals
are
going
to
be
very
hard
to
reach
but
the
state
of
our
union
will
be
much
stronger
years
from
now
on
our
th
birthday
if
we
resolve
to
reach
these
goals
now
they
are
more
importantmuch
more
importantthan
the
identity
of
the
party
or
the
president
who
will
then
be
in
office
these
goals
are
what
the
fighting
and
our
alliances
are
really
meant
to
protect
can
we
achieve
these
goals
of
course
we
canif
we
will
if
ever
there
was
a
people
who
sought
more
than
mere
abundance
it
is
our
people
if
ever
there
was
a
nation
that
was
capable
of
solving
its
problems
it
is
this
nation
if
ever
there
were
a
time
to
know
the
pride
and
the
excitement
and
the
hope
of
being
an
americanit
is
this
time
so
this
my
friends
is
the
state
of
our
union
seeking
building
tested
many
times
in
this
past
yearand
always
equal
to
the
test
thank
you
and
good
night

mr
speaker
mr
vice
president
distinguished
members
of
the
congress
i
share
with
all
of
you
the
grief
that
you
feel
at
the
death
today
of
one
of
the
most
beloved
respected
and
effective
members
of
this
body
the
distinguished
representative
from
rhode
island
mr
fogarty
i
have
come
here
tonight
to
report
to
you
that
this
is
a
time
of
testing
for
our
nation
at
home
the
question
is
whether
we
will
continue
working
for
better
opportunities
for
all
americans
when
most
americans
are
already
living
better
than
any
people
in
history
abroad
the
question
is
whether
we
have
the
staying
power
to
fight
a
very
costly
war
when
the
objective
is
limited
and
the
danger
to
us
is
seemingly
remote
so
our
test
is
not
whether
we
shrink
from
our
countrys
cause
when
the
dangers
to
us
are
obvious
and
dose
at
hand
but
rather
whether
we
carry
on
when
they
seem
obscure
and
distantand
some
think
that
it
is
safe
to
lay
down
our
burdens
i
have
come
tonight
to
ask
this
congress
and
this
nation
to
resolve
that
issue
to
meet
our
commitments
at
home
and
abroadto
continue
to
build
a
better
americaand
to
reaffirm
this
nations
allegiance
to
freedom
as
president
abraham
lincoln
said
we
must
ask
where
we
are
and
whither
we
are
tending
i
the
last
years
bear
witness
to
our
determination
to
make
this
a
better
country
we
have
struck
down
legal
barriers
to
equality
we
have
improved
the
education
of
million
deprived
children
and
this
year
alone
we
have
enabled
almost
million
students
to
go
to
college
we
have
brought
medical
care
to
older
people
who
were
unable
to
afford
it
three
and
onehalf
million
americans
have
already
received
treatment
under
medicare
since
july
we
have
built
a
strong
economy
that
has
put
almost
million
more
americans
on
the
payrolls
in
the
last
year
alone
we
have
included
more
than
million
new
workers
under
a
higher
minimum
wage
we
have
launched
new
training
programs
to
provide
job
skills
for
almost
million
americans
we
have
helped
more
than
a
thousand
local
communities
to
attack
poverty
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
poor
we
have
set
out
to
rebuild
our
cities
on
a
scale
that
has
never
been
attempted
before
we
have
begun
to
rescue
our
waters
from
the
menace
of
pollution
and
to
restore
the
beauty
of
our
land
and
our
countryside
our
cities
and
our
towns
we
have
given
million
young
americans
a
chance
to
earn
through
the
neighborhood
youth
corpsor
through
head
start
a
chance
to
learn
so
together
we
have
tried
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
people
and
we
have
succeeded
in
creating
a
better
life
for
the
many
as
well
as
the
few
now
we
must
answer
whether
our
gains
shall
be
the
foundations
of
further
progress
or
whether
they
shall
be
only
monuments
to
what
might
have
beenabandoned
now
by
a
people
who
lacked
the
will
to
see
their
great
work
through
i
believe
that
our
people
do
not
want
to
quitthough
the
task
is
great
the
work
hard
often
frustrating
and
success
is
a
matter
not
of
days
or
months
but
of
yearsand
sometimes
it
may
be
even
decades
ii
i
have
come
here
tonight
to
discuss
with
you
five
ways
of
carrying
forward
the
progress
of
these
last
years
these
five
ways
concern
programs
partnerships
priorities
prosperity
and
peace
first
programs
we
must
see
to
it
i
think
that
these
new
programs
that
we
have
passed
work
effectively
and
are
administered
in
the
best
possible
way
three
years
ago
we
set
out
to
create
these
new
instruments
of
social
progress
this
required
trial
and
errorand
it
has
produced
both
but
as
we
learn
through
success
and
failure
we
are
changing
our
strategy
and
we
are
trying
to
improve
our
tactics
in
the
long
run
these
startssome
rewarding
others
inadequate
and
disappointingare
crucial
to
success
one
example
is
the
struggle
to
make
life
better
for
the
less
fortunate
among
us
on
a
similar
occasion
at
this
rostrum
in
i
heard
a
great
american
president
harry
s
truman
declare
this
the
american
people
have
decided
that
poverty
is
just
as
wasteful
and
just
as
unnecessary
as
preventable
disease
many
listened
to
president
truman
that
day
here
in
this
chamber
but
few
understood
what
was
required
and
did
anything
about
it
the
executive
branch
and
the
congress
waited
long
years
before
ever
taking
any
action
on
that
challenge
as
it
did
on
many
other
challenges
that
great
president
presented
and
when
years
ago
you
here
in
the
congress
joined
with
me
in
a
declaration
of
war
on
poverty
then
i
warned
it
will
not
be
a
short
or
easy
struggleno
single
weapon
will
sufficebut
we
shall
not
rest
until
that
war
is
won
and
i
have
come
here
to
renew
that
pledge
tonight
i
recommend
that
we
intensify
our
efforts
to
give
the
poor
a
chance
to
enjoy
and
to
join
in
this
nations
progress
i
shall
propose
certain
administrative
changes
suggested
by
the
congressas
well
as
some
that
we
have
learned
from
our
own
trial
and
error
i
shall
urge
special
methods
and
special
funds
to
reach
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
americans
that
are
now
trapped
in
the
ghettos
of
our
big
cities
and
through
head
start
to
try
to
reach
out
to
our
very
young
little
children
the
chance
to
learn
is
their
brightest
hope
and
must
command
our
full
determination
for
learning
brings
skills
and
skills
bring
jobs
and
jobs
bring
responsibility
and
dignity
as
well
as
taxes
this
warlike
the
war
in
vietnamis
not
a
simple
one
there
is
no
single
battleline
which
you
can
plot
each
day
on
a
chart
the
enemy
is
not
easy
to
perceive
or
to
isolate
or
to
destroy
there
are
mistakes
and
there
are
setbacks
but
we
are
moving
and
our
direction
is
forward
this
is
true
with
other
programs
that
are
making
and
breaking
new
ground
some
do
not
yet
have
the
capacity
to
absorb
well
or
wisely
all
the
money
that
could
be
put
into
them
administrative
skills
and
trained
manpower
are
just
as
vital
to
their
success
as
dollars
and
i
believe
those
skills
will
come
but
it
will
take
time
and
patience
and
hard
work
success
cannot
be
forced
at
a
single
stroke
so
we
must
continue
to
strengthen
the
administration
of
every
program
if
that
success
is
to
comeas
we
know
it
must
we
have
done
much
in
the
space
of
short
years
working
together
i
have
recommended
and
you
the
congress
have
approved
different
reorganization
plans
combining
and
consolidating
many
bureaus
of
this
government
and
creating
two
entirely
new
cabinet
departments
i
have
come
tonight
to
propose
that
we
establish
a
new
departmenta
department
of
business
and
labor
by
combining
the
department
of
commerce
with
the
department
of
labor
and
other
related
agencies
i
think
we
can
create
a
more
economical
efficient
and
streamlined
instrument
that
will
better
serve
a
growing
nation
this
is
our
goal
throughout
the
entire
federal
government
every
program
will
be
thoroughly
evaluated
grantinaid
programs
will
be
improved
and
simplified
as
desired
by
many
of
our
local
administrators
and
our
governors
where
there
have
been
mistakes
we
will
try
very
hard
to
correct
them
where
there
has
been
progress
we
will
try
to
build
upon
it
our
second
objective
is
partnershipto
create
an
effective
partnership
at
all
levels
of
government
and
i
should
treasure
nothing
more
than
to
have
that
partnership
begin
between
the
executive
and
the
congress
the
th
and
the
th
congresses
passed
more
social
and
economic
legislation
than
any
two
single
congresses
in
american
history
most
of
you
who
were
members
of
those
congresses
voted
to
pass
most
of
those
measures
but
your
efforts
will
come
to
nothing
unless
it
reaches
the
people
federal
energy
is
essential
but
it
is
not
enough
only
a
total
working
partnership
among
federal
state
and
local
governments
can
succeed
the
test
of
that
partnership
will
be
the
concern
of
each
public
organization
each
private
institution
and
each
responsible
citizen
each
state
county
and
city
needs
to
examine
its
capacity
for
government
in
todays
world
as
we
are
examining
ours
in
the
executive
department
and
as
i
see
you
are
examining
yours
some
will
need
to
reorganize
and
reshape
their
methods
of
administrationas
we
are
doing
others
will
need
to
revise
their
constitutions
and
their
laws
to
bring
them
up
to
dateas
we
are
doing
above
all
i
think
we
must
work
together
and
find
ways
in
which
the
multitudes
of
small
jurisdictions
can
be
brought
together
more
efficiently
during
the
past
years
we
have
returned
to
state
and
local
governments
about
billion
in
grantsinaid
this
year
alone
percent
of
our
federal
expenditures
for
domestic
programs
will
be
distributed
through
the
state
and
local
governments
with
federal
assistance
state
and
local
governments
by
will
be
spending
close
to
billion
annually
these
enormous
sums
must
be
used
wisely
honestly
and
effectively
we
intend
to
work
closely
with
the
states
and
the
localities
to
do
exactly
that
our
third
objective
is
priorities
to
move
ahead
on
the
priorities
that
we
have
established
within
the
resources
that
are
available
i
wish
of
course
that
we
could
do
all
that
should
be
doneand
that
we
could
do
it
now
but
the
nation
has
many
commitments
and
responsibilities
which
make
heavy
demands
upon
our
total
resources
no
administration
would
more
eagerly
utilize
for
these
programs
all
the
resources
they
require
than
the
administration
that
started
them
so
let
us
resolve
now
to
do
all
that
we
can
with
what
we
haveknowing
that
it
is
far
far
more
than
we
have
ever
done
before
and
far
far
less
than
our
problems
will
ultimately
require
let
us
create
new
opportunities
for
our
children
and
our
young
americans
who
need
special
help
we
should
strengthen
the
head
start
program
begin
it
for
children
years
old
and
maintain
its
educational
momentum
by
following
through
in
the
early
years
we
should
try
new
methods
of
child
development
and
care
from
the
earliest
years
before
it
is
too
late
to
correct
and
i
will
propose
these
measures
to
the
th
congress
let
us
insure
that
older
americans
and
neglected
americans
share
in
their
nations
progress
we
should
raise
social
security
payments
by
an
overall
average
of
percent
that
will
add
billion
million
to
social
security
payments
in
the
first
year
i
will
recommend
that
each
of
the
million
americans
now
receiving
payments
get
an
increase
of
at
le
ast
percent
i
will
ask
that
you
raise
the
minimum
payments
by
percentfrom
to
a
month
and
to
guarantee
a
minimum
benefit
of
a
month
for
those
with
a
total
of
years
of
coverage
we
must
raise
the
limits
that
retired
workers
can
earn
without
losing
social
security
income
we
must
eliminate
by
law
unjust
discrimination
in
employment
because
of
age
we
should
embark
upon
a
major
effort
to
provide
selfhelp
assistance
to
the
forgotten
in
our
midstthe
american
indians
and
the
migratory
farm
workers
and
we
should
reach
with
the
hand
of
understanding
to
help
those
who
live
in
rural
poverty
and
i
will
propose
these
measures
to
the
th
congress
so
let
us
keep
on
improving
the
quality
of
life
and
enlarging
the
meaning
of
justice
for
all
of
our
fellow
americans
we
should
transform
our
decaying
slums
into
places
of
decency
through
the
landmark
model
cities
program
i
intend
to
seek
for
this
effort
this
year
the
full
amount
that
you
in
congress
authorized
last
year
we
should
call
upon
the
genius
of
private
industry
and
the
most
advanced
technology
to
help
rebuild
our
great
cities
we
should
vastly
expand
the
fight
for
dean
air
with
a
total
attack
on
pollution
at
its
sources
andbecause
air
like
water
does
not
respect
manmade
boundarieswe
should
set
up
regional
airsheds
throughout
this
great
land
we
should
continue
to
carry
to
every
corner
of
the
nation
our
campaign
for
a
beautiful
americato
dean
up
our
towns
to
make
them
more
beautiful
our
cities
our
countryside
by
creating
more
parks
and
more
seashores
and
more
open
spaces
for
our
children
to
play
in
and
for
the
generations
that
come
after
us
to
enjoy
we
should
continue
to
seek
equality
and
justice
for
each
citizenbefore
a
jury
in
seeking
a
job
in
exercising
his
civil
rights
we
should
find
a
solution
to
fair
housing
so
that
every
american
regardless
of
color
has
a
decent
home
of
his
choice
we
should
modernize
our
selective
service
system
the
national
commission
on
selective
service
will
shortly
submit
its
report
i
will
send
you
new
recommendations
to
meet
our
military
manpower
needs
but
let
us
resolve
that
this
is
to
be
the
congress
that
made
our
draft
laws
as
fair
and
as
effective
as
possible
we
should
protect
what
justice
brandeis
called
the
right
most
valued
by
civilized
menthe
right
to
privacy
we
should
outlaw
all
wiretappingpublic
and
privatewherever
and
whenever
it
occurs
except
when
the
security
of
this
nation
itself
is
at
stakeand
only
then
with
the
strictest
governmental
safeguards
and
we
should
exercise
the
full
reach
of
our
constitutional
powers
to
outlaw
electronic
bugging
and
snooping
i
hope
this
congress
will
try
to
help
me
do
more
for
the
consumer
we
should
demand
that
the
cost
of
credit
be
clearly
and
honestly
expressed
where
average
citizens
can
understand
it
we
should
immediately
take
steps
to
prevent
massive
power
failures
to
safeguard
the
home
against
hazardous
household
products
and
to
assure
safety
in
the
pipelines
that
carry
natural
gas
across
our
nation
we
should
extend
medicare
benefits
that
are
now
denied
to
permanently
and
totally
disabled
americans
under
years
of
age
we
should
improve
the
process
of
democracy
by
passing
our
election
reform
and
financing
proposals
by
tightening
our
laws
regulating
lobbying
and
by
restoring
a
reasonable
franchise
to
americans
who
move
their
residences
we
should
develop
educational
television
into
a
vital
public
resource
to
enrich
our
homes
educate
our
families
and
to
provide
assistance
in
our
classrooms
we
should
insist
that
the
public
interest
be
fully
served
through
the
publics
airwaves
and
i
will
propose
these
measures
to
the
th
congress
now
we
come
to
a
question
that
weighs
very
heavily
on
all
our
mindson
yours
and
mine
this
nation
must
make
an
allout
effort
to
combat
crime
the
th
congress
gave
us
a
new
start
in
the
attack
on
crime
by
passing
the
law
enforcement
assistance
act
that
i
recommended
we
appointed
the
national
crime
commission
to
study
crime
in
america
and
to
recommend
the
best
ways
to
carry
that
attack
forward
and
while
we
do
not
have
all
the
answers
on
the
basis
of
its
preliminary
recommendations
we
are
ready
to
move
this
is
not
a
war
that
washington
alone
can
win
the
idea
of
a
national
police
force
is
repugnant
to
the
american
people
crime
must
be
rooted
out
in
local
communities
by
local
authorities
our
policemen
must
be
better
trained
must
be
better
paid
and
must
be
better
supported
by
the
local
citizens
that
they
try
to
serve
and
to
protect
the
national
government
can
and
expects
to
help
and
so
i
will
recommend
to
the
th
congress
the
safe
streets
and
crime
control
act
of
it
will
enable
us
to
assist
those
states
and
cities
that
try
to
make
their
streets
and
homes
safer
their
police
forces
better
their
corrections
systems
more
effective
and
their
courts
more
efficient
when
the
congress
approves
the
federal
government
will
be
able
to
provide
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
cost
percent
of
the
cost
of
developing
the
state
and
local
plans
master
plans
to
combat
crime
in
their
area
percent
of
the
cost
of
training
new
tactical
units
developing
instant
communications
and
special
alarm
systems
and
introducing
the
latest
equipment
and
techniques
so
that
they
can
become
weapons
in
the
war
on
crime
percent
of
the
cost
of
building
crime
laboratories
and
police
academytype
centers
so
that
our
citizens
can
be
protected
by
the
best
trained
and
served
by
the
best
equipped
police
to
be
found
anywhere
we
will
also
recommend
new
methods
to
prevent
juvenile
delinquents
from
becoming
adult
delinquents
we
will
seek
new
partnerships
with
states
and
cities
in
order
to
deal
with
this
hideous
narcotics
problem
and
we
will
recommend
strict
controls
on
the
sale
of
firearms
at
the
heart
of
this
attack
on
crime
must
be
the
conviction
that
a
free
americaas
abraham
lincoln
once
saidmust
let
reverence
for
the
laws
become
the
political
religion
of
the
nation
our
countrys
laws
must
be
respected
order
must
be
maintained
and
i
will
supportwith
all
the
constitutional
powers
the
president
possessesour
nations
law
enforcement
officials
in
their
attempt
to
control
the
crime
and
the
violence
that
tear
the
fabric
of
our
communities
many
of
these
priority
proposals
will
be
built
on
foundations
that
have
already
been
laid
some
will
necessarily
be
small
at
first
but
every
beginning
is
a
consequence
if
we
postpone
this
urgent
work
now
it
will
simply
have
to
be
done
later
and
later
we
will
pay
a
much
higher
price
our
fourth
objective
is
prosperity
to
keep
our
economy
moving
ahead
moving
ahead
steadily
and
safely
we
have
now
enjoyed
years
of
unprecedented
and
rewarding
prosperity
last
year
in
wages
were
the
highest
in
historyand
the
unemployment
rate
announced
yesterday
reached
the
lowest
point
in
years
total
aftertax
income
of
american
families
rose
nearly
percent
corporate
profits
after
taxes
rose
a
little
more
than
percent
our
gross
national
product
advanced
percent
to
about
billion
income
per
farm
went
up
percent
now
we
have
been
greatly
concerned
because
consumer
prices
rose
percent
over
the
months
since
we
decided
to
send
troops
to
vietnam
this
was
more
than
we
had
expectedand
the
government
tried
to
do
everything
that
we
knew
how
to
do
to
hold
it
down
yet
we
were
not
as
successful
as
we
wished
to
be
in
the
months
after
we
entered
world
war
ii
prices
rose
not
percent
but
percent
in
the
first
months
after
korea
after
the
conflict
broke
out
there
prices
rose
not
percent
but
percent
during
those
two
periods
we
had
opa
price
control
that
the
congress
gave
us
and
war
labor
board
wage
controls
since
vietnam
we
have
not
asked
for
those
controls
and
we
have
tried
to
avoid
imposing
them
we
believe
that
we
have
done
better
but
we
make
no
pretense
of
having
been
successful
or
doing
as
well
as
we
wished
our
greatest
disappointment
in
the
economy
during
was
the
excessive
rise
in
interest
rates
and
the
tightening
of
credit
they
imposed
very
severe
and
very
unfair
burdens
on
our
home
buyers
and
on
our
home
builders
and
all
those
associated
with
the
home
industry
last
january
and
again
last
september
i
recommended
fiscal
and
moderate
tax
measures
to
try
to
restrain
the
unbalanced
pace
of
economic
expansion
legislatively
and
administratively
we
took
several
billions
out
of
the
economy
with
these
measures
in
both
instances
the
congress
approved
most
of
the
recommendations
rather
promptly
as
ended
price
stability
was
seemingly
being
restored
wholesale
prices
are
lower
tonight
than
they
were
in
august
so
are
retail
food
prices
monetary
conditions
are
also
easing
most
interest
rates
have
retreated
from
their
earlier
peaks
more
money
now
seems
to
be
available
given
the
cooperation
of
the
federal
reserve
system
which
i
so
earnestly
seek
i
am
confident
that
this
movement
can
continue
i
pledge
the
american
people
that
i
will
do
everything
in
a
presidents
power
to
lower
interest
rates
and
to
ease
money
in
this
country
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
tomorrow
morning
will
announce
that
it
will
make
immediately
available
to
savings
and
loan
associations
an
additional
billion
and
will
lower
from
percent
to
percent
the
interest
rate
charged
on
those
loans
we
shall
continue
on
a
sensible
course
of
fiscal
and
budgetary
policy
that
we
believe
will
keep
our
economy
growing
without
new
inflationary
spirals
that
will
finance
responsibly
the
needs
of
our
men
in
vietnam
and
the
progress
of
our
people
at
home
that
will
support
a
significant
improvement
in
our
export
surplus
and
will
press
forward
toward
easier
credit
and
toward
lower
interest
rates
i
recommend
to
the
congress
a
surcharge
of
percent
on
both
corporate
and
individual
income
taxesto
last
for
years
or
for
so
long
as
the
unusual
expenditures
associated
with
our
efforts
in
vietnam
continue
i
will
promptly
recommend
an
earlier
termination
date
if
a
reduction
in
these
expenditures
permits
it
this
surcharge
will
raise
revenues
by
some
billion
in
the
first
year
for
example
a
person
whose
tax
payment
the
tax
he
owes
is
will
pay
under
this
proposal
an
extra
over
the
month
period
or
a
month
the
overwhelming
majority
of
americans

who
pay
taxes
today
are
below
that
figure
and
they
will
pay
substantially
less
than
a
month
married
couples
with
two
children
with
incomes
up
to
per
year
will
be
exempt
from
this
taxas
will
single
people
with
an
income
of
up
to
a
year
now
if
americans
today
still
paid
the
income
and
excise
tax
rates
in
effect
when
i
came
into
the
presidency
in
the
year
their
annual
taxes
would
have
been
over
billion
more
than
at
present
tax
rates
so
this
proposal
is
that
while
we
have
this
problem
and
this
emergency
in
vietnam
while
we
are
trying
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
people
at
home
your
government
asks
for
slightly
more
than
onefourth
of
that
tax
cut
each
year
in
order
to
try
to
hold
our
budget
deficit
in
fiscal
within
prudent
limits
and
to
give
our
country
and
to
give
our
fighting

they

in
this
hour
of
trial
for

we
estimate
the

to
be

of

will
leave

i
will
very
soon
forward
all
of
my
recommendations
to
the
congress
yours
is
the
responsibility
to
discuss
and
to
debate
themto
approve
or
modify
or
reject
them
i
welcome
your
views
as
i
have
welcomed
working
with
you
for
years
as
a
colleague
and
as
vice
president
and
president
i
should
like
to
say
to
the
members
of
the
oppositionwhose
numbers
if
i
am
not
mistaken
seem
to
have
increased
somewhatthat
the
genius
of
the
american
political
system
has
always
been
best
expressed
through
creative
debate
that
offers
choices
and
reasonable
alternatives
throughout
our
history
great
republicans
and
democrats
have
seemed
to
understand
this
so
let
there
be
light
and
reason
in
our
relations
that
is
the
way
to
a
responsible
session
and
a
responsive
government
let
us
be
remembered
as
a
president
and
a
congress
who
tried
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
every
americannot
just
the
rich
not
just
the
poor
but
every
man
woman
and
child
in
this
great
nation
of
ours
we
all
go
to
schoolto
good
schools
or
bad
schools
we
all
take
air
into
our
lungsclean
air
or
polluted
air
we
all
drink
waterpure
water
or
polluted
water
we
all
face
sickness
someday
and
some
more
often
than
we
wish
and
old
age
as
well
we
all
have
a
stake
in
this
great
societyin
its
economic
growth
in
reduction
of
civil
strifea
great
stake
in
good
government
we
just
must
not
arrest
the
pace
of
progress
we
have
established
in
this
country
in
these
years
our
childrens
children
will
pay
the
price
if
we
are
not
wise
enough
and
courageous
enough
and
determined
enough
to
stand
up
and
meet
the
nations
needs
as
well
as
we
can
in
the
time
allotted
us
iii
abroad
as
at
home
there
is
also
risk
in
change
but
abroad
as
at
home
there
is
a
greater
risk
in
standing
still
no
part
of
our
foreign
policy
is
so
sacred
that
it
ever
remains
beyond
review
we
shall
be
flexible
where
conditions
in
the
world
changeand
where
mans
efforts
can
change
them
for
the
better
we
are
in
the
midst
of
a
great
transitiona
transition
from
narrow
nationalism
to
international
partnership
from
the
harsh
spirit
of
the
cold
war
to
the
hopeful
spirit
of
common
humanity
on
a
troubled
and
a
threatened
planet
in
latin
america
the
american
chiefs
of
state
will
be
meeting
very
shortly
to
give
our
hemispheric
policies
new
direction
we
have
come
a
long
way
in
this
hemisphere
since
the
interamerican
effort
in
economic
and
social
development
was
launched
by
the
conference
at
bogota
in
under
the
leadership
of
president
eisenhower
the
alliance
for
progress
moved
dramatically
forward
under
president
kennedy
there
is
new
confidence
that
the
voice
of
the
people
is
being
heard
that
the
dignity
of
the
individual
is
stronger
than
ever
in
this
hemisphere
and
we
are
facing
up
to
and
meeting
many
of
the
hemispheric
problems
together
in
this
hemisphere
that
reform
under
democracy
can
be
made
to
happenbecause
it
has
happened
so
together
i
think
we
must
now
move
to
strike
down
the
barriers
to
full
cooperation
among
the
american
nations
and
to
free
the
energies
and
the
resources
of
two
great
continents
on
behalf
of
all
of
our
citizens
africa
stands
at
an
earlier
stage
of
development
than
latin
america
it
has
yet
to
develop
the
transportation
communications
agriculture
and
above
all
the
trained
men
and
women
without
which
growth
is
impossible
there
too
the
job
will
best
be
done
if
the
nations
and
peoples
of
africa
cooperate
on
a
regional
basis
more
and
more
our
programs
for
africa
are
going
to
be
directed
toward
selfhelp
the
future
of
africa
is
shadowed
by
unsolved
racial
conflicts
our
policy
will
continue
to
reflect
our
basic
commitments
as
a
people
to
support
those
who
are
prepared
to
work
towards
cooperation
and
harmony
between
races
and
to
help
those
who
demand
change
but
reject
the
fools
gold
of
violence
in
the
middle
east
the
spirit
of
good
will
toward
all
unfortunately
has
not
yet
taken
hold
an
already
tortured
peace
seems
to
be
constantly
threatened
we
shall
try
to
use
our
influence
to
increase
the
possibilities
of
improved
relations
among
the
nations
of
that
region
we
are
working
hard
at
that
task
in
the
great
subcontinent
of
south
asia
live
more
than
a
sixth
of
the
earths
population
over
the
years
weand
othershave
invested
very
heavily
in
capital
and
food
for
the
economic
development
of
india
and
pakistan
we
are
not
prepared
to
see
our
assistance
wasted
however
in
conflict
it
must
strengthen
their
capacity
to
help
themselves
it
must
help
these
two
nationsboth
our
friendsto
overcome
poverty
to
emerge
as
selfreliant
leaders
and
find
terms
for
reconciliation
and
cooperation
in
western
europe
we
shall
maintain
in
nato
an
integrated
common
defense
but
we
also
look
forward
to
the
time
when
greater
security
can
be
achieved
through
measures
of
arms
control
and
disarmament
and
through
other
forms
of
practical
agreement
we
are
shaping
a
new
future
of
enlarged
partnership
in
nuclear
affairs
in
economic
and
technical
cooperation
in
trade
negotiations
in
political
consultation
and
in
working
together
with
the
governments
and
peoples
of
eastern
europe
and
the
soviet
union
the
emerging
spirit
of
confidence
is
precisely
what
we
hoped
to
achieve
when
we
went
to
work
a
generation
ago
to
put
our
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
try
to
help
rebuild
europe
we
faced
new
challenges
and
opportunities
then
and
thereand
we
faced
also
some
dangers
but
i
believe
that
the
peoples
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
as
well
as
both
sides
of
this
chamber
wanted
to
face
them
together
our
relations
with
the
soviet
union
and
eastern
europe
are
also
in
transition
we
have
avoided
both
the
acts
and
the
rhetoric
of
the
cold
war
when
we
have
differed
with
the
soviet
union
or
other
nations
for
that
matter
i
have
tried
to
differ
quietly
and
with
courtesy
and
without
venom
our
objective
is
not
to
continue
the
cold
war
but
to
end
it
we
have
reached
an
agreement
at
the
united
nations
on
the
peaceful
uses
of
outer
space
we
have
agreed
to
open
direct
air
flights
with
the
soviet
union
we
have
removed
more
than
nonstrategic
items
from
export
control
we
are
determined
that
the
exportimport
bank
can
allow
commercial
credits
to
poland
hungary
bulgaria
and
czechoslovakia
as
well
as
to
romania
and
yugoslavia
we
have
entered
into
a
cultural
agreement
with
the
soviet
union
for
another
years
we
have
agreed
with
bulgaria
and
hungary
to
upgrade
our
legations
to
embassies
we
have
started
discussions
with
international
agencies
on
ways
of
increasing
contacts
with
eastern
european
countries
this
administration
has
taken
these
steps
even
as
duty
compelled
us
to
fulfill
and
execute
alliances
and
treaty
obligations
throughout
the
world
that
were
entered
into
before
i
became
president
so
tonight
i
now
ask
and
urge
this
congress
to
help
our
foreign
and
our
commercial
trade
policies
by
passing
an
eastwest
trade
bill
and
by
approving
our
consular
convention
with
the
soviet
union
the
soviet
union
has
in
the
past
year
increased
its
longrange
missile
capabilities
it
has
begun
to
place
near
moscow
a
limited
antimissile
defense
my
first
responsibility
to
our
people
is
to
assure
that
no
nation
can
ever
find
it
rational
to
launch
a
nuclear
attack
or
to
use
its
nuclear
power
as
a
credible
threat
against
us
or
against
our
allies
i
would
emphasize
that
that
is
why
an
important
link
between
russia
and
the
united
states
is
in
our
common
interest
in
arms
control
and
in
disarmament
we
have
the
solemn
duty
to
slow
down
the
arms
race
between
us
if
that
is
at
all
possible
in
both
conventional
and
nuclear
weapons
and
defenses
i
thought
we
were
making
some
progress
in
that
direction
the
first
few
months
i
was
in
office
i
realize
that
any
additional
race
would
impose
on
our
peoples
and
on
all
mankind
for
that
matter
an
additional
waste
of
resources
with
no
gain
in
security
to
either
side
i
expect
in
the
days
ahead
to
closely
consult
and
seek
the
advice
of
the
congress
about
the
possibilities
of
international
agreements
bearing
directly
upon
this
problem
next
to
the
pursuit
of
peace
the
really
greatest
challenge
to
the
human
family
is
the
race
between
food
supply
and
population
increase
that
race
tonight
is
being
lost
the
time
for
rhetoric
has
clearly
passed
the
time
for
concerted
action
is
here
and
we
must
get
on
with
the
job
we
believe
that
three
principles
must
prevail
if
our
policy
is
to
succeed
first
the
developing
nations
must
give
highest
priority
to
food
production
including
the
use
of
technology
and
the
capital
of
private
enterprise
second
nations
with
food
deficits
must
put
more
of
their
resources
into
voluntary
family
planning
programs
and
third
the
developed
nations
must
all
assist
other
nations
to
avoid
starvation
in
the
short
run
and
to
move
rapidly
towards
the
ability
to
feed
themselves
every
member
of
the
world
community
now
bears
a
direct
responsibility
to
help
bring
our
most
basic
human
account
into
balance
iv
i
come
now
finally
to
southeast
asiaand
to
vietnam
in
particular
soon
i

will
submit
to
the
congress
a
detailed
report
on
that
situation
tonight
i
want
to
just
review
the
essential
points
as
briefly
as
i
can
we
are
in
vietnam
because
the
united
states
of
america
and
our
allies
are
committed
by
the
seato
treaty
to
act
to
meet
the
common
danger
of
aggression
in
southeast
asia
we
are
in
vietnam
because
an
international
agreement
signed
by
the
united
states
north
vietnam
and
others
in
is
being
systematically
violated
by
the
communists
that
violation
threatens
the
independence
of
all
the
small
nations
in
southeast
asia
and
threatens
the
peace
of
the
entire
region
and
perhaps
the
world
we
are
there
because
the
people
of
south
vietnam
have
as
much
right
to
remain
noncommunistif
that
is
what
they
chooseas
north
vietnam
has
to
remain
communist
we
are
there
because
the
congress
has
pledged
by
solemn
vote
to
take
all
necessary
measures
to
prevent
further
aggression
no
better
words
could
describe
our
present
course
than
those
once
spoken
by
the
great
thomas
jefferson
it
is
the
melancholy
law
of
human
societies
to
be
compelled
sometimes
to
choose
a
great
evil
in
order
to
ward
off
a
greater
we
have
chosen
to
fight
a
limited
war
in
vietnam
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
a
larger
wara
war
almost
certain
to
follow
i
believe
if
the
communists
succeed
in
overrunning
and
taking
over
south
vietnam
by
aggression
and
by
force
i
believe
and
i
am
supported
by
some
authority
that
if
they
are
not
checked
now
the
world
can
expect
to
pay
a
greater
price
to
check
them
later
that
is
what
our
statesmen
said
when
they
debated
this
treaty
and
that
is
why
it
was
ratified
to
by
the
senate
many
years
ago
you
will
remember
that
we
stood
in
western
europe
years
ago
is
there
anyone
in
this
chamber
tonight
who
doubts
that
the
course
of
freedom
was
not
changed
for
the
better
because
of
the
courage
of
that
stand
sixteen
years
ago
we
and
others
stopped
another
kind
of
aggressionthis
time
it
was
in
korea
imagine
how
different
asia
might
be
today
if
we
had
failed
to
act
when
the
communist
army
of
north
korea
marched
south
the
asia
of
tomorrow
will
be
far
different
because
we
have
said
in
vietnam
as
we
said
years
ago
in
korea
this
far
and
no
further
i
think
i
reveal
no
secret
when
i
tell
you
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
stubborn
adversary
who
is
committed
to
the
use
of
force
and
terror
to
settle
political
questions
i
wish
i
could
report
to
you
that
the
conflict
is
almost
over
this
i
cannot
do
we
face
more
cost
more
loss
and
more
agony
for
the
end
is
not
yet
i
cannot
promise
you
that
it
will
come
this
yearor
come
next
year
our
adversary
still
believes
i
think
tonight
that
he
can
go
on
fighting
longer
than
we
can
and
longer
than
we
and
our
allies
will
be
prepared
to
stand
up
and
resist
our
men
in
that
areathere
are
nearly
nowhave
borne
well
the
burden
and
the
heat
of
the
day
their
efforts
have
deprived
the
communist
enemy
of
the
victory
that
he
sought
and
that
he
expected
a
year
ago
we
have
steadily
frustrated
his
main
forces
general
westmoreland
reports
that
the
enemy
can
no
longer
succeed
on
the
battlefield
so
i
must
say
to
you
that
our
pressure
must
be
sustainedand
will
be
sustaineduntil
he
realizes
that
the
war
he
started
is
costing
him
more
than
he
can
ever
gain
i
know
of
no
strategy
more
likely
to
attain
that
end
than
the
strategy
of
accumulating
slowly
but
inexorably
every
kind
of
material
resourceof
laboriously
teaching
troops
the
very
elements
of
their
trade
that
and
patienceand
i
mean
a
great
deal
of
patience
our
south
vietnamese
allies
are
also
being
tested
tonight
because
they
must
provide
real
security
to
the
people
living
in
the
countryside
and
this
means
reducing
the
terrorism
and
the
armed
attacks
which
kidnaped
and
killed
civilians
in
the
last
months
to
levels
where
they
can
be
successfully
controlled
by
the
regular
south
vietnamese
security
forces
it
means
bringing
to
the
villagers
an
effective
civilian
government
that
they
can
respect
and
that
they
can
rely
upon
and
that
they
can
participate
in
and
that
they
can
have
a
personal
stake
in
we
hope
that
government
is
now
beginning
to
emerge
while
i
cannot
report
the
desired
progress
in
the
pacification
effort
the
very
distinguished
and
able
ambassador
henry
cabot
lodge
reports
that
south
vietnam
is
turning
to
this
task
with
a
new
sense
of
urgency
we
can
help
but
only
they
can
win
this
part
of
the
war
their
task
is
to
build
and
protect
a
new
life
in
each
rural
province
one
result
of
our
stand
in
vietnam
is
already
clear
it
is
this
the
peoples
of
asia
now
know
that
the
door
to
independence
is
not
going
to
be
slammed
shut
they
know
that
it
is
possible
for
them
to
choose
their
own
national
destinieswithout
coercion
the
performance
of
our
men
in
vietnambacked
by
the
american
peoplehas
created
a
feeling
of
confidence
and
unity
among
the
independent
nations
of
asia
and
the
pacific
i
saw
it
in
their
faces
in
the
days
that
i
spent
in
their
homes
and
in
their
countries
fear
of
external
communist
conquest
in
many
asian
nations
is
already
subsidingand
with
this
the
spirit
of
hope
is
rising
for
the
first
time
in
history
a
common
outlook
and
common
institutions
are
already
emerging
this
forward
movement
is
rooted
in
the
ambitions
and
the
interests
of
asian
nations
themselves
it
was
precisely
this
movement
that
we
hoped
to
accelerate
when
i
spoke
at
johns
hopkins
in
baltimore
in
april
and
i
pledged
a
much
more
massive
effort
to
improve
the
life
of
man
in
that
part
of
the
world
in
the
hope
that
we
could
take
some
of
the
funds
that
we
were
spending
on
bullets
and
bombs
and
spend
it
on
schools
and
production
twenty
months
later
our
efforts
have
produced
a
new
reality
the
doors
of
the
billion
dollar
asian
development
bank
that
i
recommended
to
the
congress
and
you
endorsed
almost
unanimously
i
am
proud
to
tell
you
are
already
open
asians
are
engaged
tonight
in
regional
efforts
in
a
dozen
new
directions
their
hopes
are
high
their
faith
is
strong
their
confidence
is
deep
and
even
as
the
war
continues
we
shall
play
our
part
in
carrying
forward
this
constructive
historic
development
as
recommended
by
the
eugene
black
mission
and
if
other
nations
will
join
us
i
will
seek
a
special
authorization
from
the
congress
of
million
for
east
asian
regional
programs
we
are
eager
to
turn
our
resources
to
peace
our
efforts
in
behalf
of
humanity
i
think
need
not
be
restricted
by
any
parallel
or
by
any
boundary
line
the
moment
that
peace
comes
as
i
pledged
in
baltimore
i
will
ask
the
congress
for
funds
to
join
in
an
international
program
of
reconstruction
and
development
for
all
the
people
of
vietnamand
their
deserving
neighbors
who
wish
our
help
we
shall
continue
to
hope
for
a
reconciliation
between
the
people
of
mainland
china
and
the
world
communityincluding
working
together
in
all
the
tasks
of
arms
control
security
and
progress
on
which
the
fate
of
the
chinese
people
like
their
fellow
men
elsewhere
depends
we
would
be
the
first
to
welcome
a
china
which
decided
to
respect
her
neighbors
rights
we
would
be
the
first
to
applaud
her
were
she
to
apply
her
great
energies
and
intelligence
to
improving
the
welfare
of
her
people
and
we
have
no
intention
of
trying
to
deny
her
legitimate
needs
for
security
and
friendly
relations
with
her
neighboring
countries
our
hope
that
all
of
this
will
someday
happen
rests
on
the
conviction
that
we
the
american
people
and
our
allies
will
and
are
going
to
see
vietnam
through
to
an
honorable
peace
we
will
support
all
appropriate
initiatives
by
the
united
nations
and
others
which
can
bring
the
several
parties
together
for
unconditional
discussions
of
peaceanywhere
any
time
and
we
will
continue
to
take
every
possible
initiative
ourselves
to
constantly
probe
for
peace
until
such
efforts
succeed
or
until
the
infiltration
ceases
or
until
the
conflict
subsides
i
think
the
course
of
wisdom
for
this
country
is
that
we
just
must
firmly
pursue
our
present
course
we
will
stand
firm
in
vietnam
i
think
you
know
that
our
fighting
men
there
tonight
bear
the
heaviest
burden
of
all
with
their
lives
they
serve
their
nation
we
must
give
them
nothing
less
than
our
full
supportand
we
have
given
them
thatnothing
less
than
the
determination
that
americans
have
always
given
their
fighting
men
whatever
our
sacrifice
here
even
if
it
is
more
than
a
month
it
is
small
compared
to
their
own
how
long
it
will
take
i
cannot
prophesy
i
only
know
that
the
will
of
the
american
people
i
think
is
tonight
being
tested
whether
we
can
fight
a
war
of
limited
objectives
over
a
period
of
time
and
keep
alive
the
hope
of
independence
and
stability
for
people
other
than
ourselves
whether
we
can
continue
to
act
with
restraint
when
the
temptation
to
get
it
over
with
is
inviting
but
dangerous
whether
we
can
accept
the
necessity
of
choosing
a
great
evil
in
order
to
ward
off
a
greater
whether
we
can
do
these
without
arousing
the
hatreds
and
the
passions
that
are
ordinarily
loosed
in
time
of
waron
all
these
questions
so
much
turns
the
answers
will
determine
not
only
where
we
are
but
whither
we
are
tending
a
time
of
testingyes
and
a
time
of
transition
the
transition
is
sometimes
slow
sometimes
unpopular
almost
always
very
painful
and
often
quite
dangerous
but
we
have
lived
with
danger
for
a
long
time
before
and
we
shall
live
with
it
for
a
long
time
yet
to
come
we
know
that
man
is
born
unto
trouble
we
also
know
that
this
nation
was
not
forged
and
did
not
survive
and
grow
and
prosper
without
a
great
deal
of
sacrifice
from
a
great
many
men
for
all
the
disorders
that
we
must
deal
with
and
all
the
frustrations
that
concern
us
and
all
the
anxieties
that
we
are
called
upon
to
resolve
for
all
the
issues
we
must
face
with
the
agony
that
attends
them
let
us
remember
that
those
who
expect
to
reap
the
blessings
of
freedom
must
like
men
undergo
the
fatigues
of
supporting
it
but
let
us
also
count
not
only
our
burdens
but
our
blessingsfor
they
are
many
and
let
us
give
thanks
to
the
one
who
governs
us
all
let
us
draw
encouragement
from
the
signs
of
hopefor
they
too
are
many
let
us
remember
that
we
have
been
tested
before
and
america
has
never
been
f
ound
wanting
so
with
your
understanding
i
would
hope
your
confidence
and
your
support
we
are
going
to
persistand
we
are
going
to
succeed

mr
speaker
mr
president
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate
my
fellow
americans
i
come
before
you
tonight
to
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
for
the
third
time
i
come
here
to
thank
you
and
to
add
my
tribute
once
more
to
the
nations
gratitude
for
this
the
th
congress
this
congress
has
already
reserved
for
itself
an
honored
chapter
in
the
history
of
america
our
nation
tonight
is
engaged
in
a
brutal
and
bitter
conflict
in
vietnam
later
on
i
want
to
discuss
that
struggle
in
some
detail
with
you
it
just
must
be
the
center
of
our
concerns
but
we
will
not
permit
those
who
fire
upon
us
in
vietnam
to
win
a
victory
over
the
desires
and
the
intentions
of
all
the
american
people
this
nation
is
mighty
enough
its
society
is
healthy
enough
its
people
are
strong
enough
to
pursue
our
goals
in
the
rest
of
the
world
while
still
building
a
great
society
here
at
home
and
that
is
what
i
have
come
here
to
ask
of
you
tonight
i
recommend
that
you
provide
the
resources
to
carry
forward
with
full
vigor
the
great
health
and
education
programs
that
you
enacted
into
law
last
year
i
recommend
that
we
prosecute
with
vigor
and
determination
our
war
on
poverty
i
recommend
that
you
give
a
new
and
daring
direction
to
our
foreign
aid
program
designed
to
make
a
maximum
attack
on
hunger
and
disease
and
ignorance
in
those
countries
that
are
determined
to
help
themselves
and
to
help
those
nations
that
are
trying
to
control
population
growth
i
recommend
that
you
make
it
possible
to
expand
trade
between
the
united
states
and
eastern
europe
and
the
soviet
union
i
recommend
to
you
a
program
to
rebuild
completely
on
a
scale
never
before
attempted
entire
central
and
slum
areas
of
several
of
our
cities
in
america
i
recommend
that
you
attack
the
wasteful
and
degrading
poisoning
of
our
rivers
and
as
the
cornerstone
of
this
effort
clean
completely
entire
large
river
basins
i
recommend
that
you
meet
the
growing
menace
of
crime
in
the
streets
by
building
up
law
enforcement
and
by
revitalizing
the
entire
federal
system
from
prevention
to
probation
i
recommend
that
you
take
additional
steps
to
insure
equal
justice
to
all
of
our
people
by
effectively
enforcing
nondiscrimination
in
federal
and
state
jury
selection
by
making
it
a
serious
federal
crime
to
obstruct
public
and
private
efforts
to
secure
civil
rights
and
by
outlawing
discrimination
in
the
sale
and
rental
of
housing
i
recommend
that
you
help
me
modernize
and
streamline
the
federal
government
by
creating
a
new
cabinet
level
department
of
transportation
and
reorganizing
several
existing
agencies
in
turn
i
will
restructure
our
civil
service
in
the
top
grades
so
that
men
and
women
can
easily
be
assigned
to
jobs
where
they
are
most
needed
and
ability
will
be
both
required
as
well
as
rewarded
i
will
ask
you
to
make
it
possible
for
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
work
more
effectively
in
the
service
of
the
nation
through
a
constitutional
amendment
extending
the
term
of
a
congressman
to
years
concurrent
with
that
of
the
president
ii
because
of
vietnam
we
cannot
do
all
that
we
should
or
all
that
we
would
like
to
do
we
will
ruthlessly
attack
waste
and
inefficiency
we
will
make
sure
that
every
dollar
is
spent
with
the
thrift
and
with
the
commonsense
which
recognizes
how
hard
the
taxpayer
worked
in
order
to
earn
it
we
will
continue
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
people
by
continuing
to
develop
the
great
society
last
year
alone
the
wealth
that
we
produced
increased
billion
and
it
will
soar
again
this
year
to
a
total
over
billion
because
our
economic
policies
have
produced
rising
revenues
if
you
approve
every
program
that
i
recommend
tonight
our
total
budget
deficit
will
be
one
of
the
lowest
in
many
years
it
will
be
only
billion
next
year
total
spending
in
the
administrative
budget
will
be
billion
revenues
next
year
will
be
billion
on
a
cash
basiswhich
is
the
way
that
you
and
i
keep
our
family
budgetthe
federal
budget
next
year
will
actually
show
a
surplus
that
is
to
say
if
we
include
all
the
money
that
your
government
will
take
in
and
all
the
money
that
your
government
will
spend
your
government
next
year
will
collect
onehalf
billion
dollars
more
than
it
will
spend
in
the
year
i
have
not
come
here
tonight
to
ask
for
pleasant
luxuries
or
for
idle
pleasures
i
have
come
here
to
recommend
that
you
the
representatives
of
the
richest
nation
on
earth
you
the
elected
servants
of
a
people
who
live
in
abundance
unmatched
on
this
globe
you
bring
the
most
urgent
decencies
of
life
to
all
of
your
fellow
americans
there
are
men
who
cry
out
we
must
sacrifice
well
let
us
rather
ask
them
who
will
they
sacrifice
are
they
going
to
sacrifice
the
children
who
seek
the
learning
or
the
sick
who
need
medical
care
or
the
families
who
dwell
in
squalor
now
brightened
by
the
hope
of
home
will
they
sacrifice
opportunity
for
the
distressed
the
beauty
of
our
land
the
hope
of
our
poor
time
may
require
further
sacrifices
and
if
it
does
then
we
will
make
them
but
we
will
not
heed
those
who
wring
it
from
the
hopes
of
the
unfortunate
here
in
a
land
of
plenty
i
believe
that
we
can
continue
the
great
society
while
we
fight
in
vietnam
but
if
there
are
some
who
do
not
believe
this
then
in
the
name
of
justice
let
them
call
for
the
contribution
of
those
who
live
in
the
fullness
of
our
blessing
rather
than
try
to
strip
it
from
the
hands
of
those
that
are
most
in
need
and
let
no
one
think
that
the
unfortunate
and
the
oppressed
of
this
land
sit
stifled
and
alone
in
their
hope
tonight
hundreds
of
their
servants
and
their
protectors
sit
before
me
tonight
here
in
this
great
chamber
iii
the
great
society
leads
us
along
three
roadsgrowth
and
justice
and
liberation
i
can
report
to
you
tonight
what
you
have
seen
for
yourselves
alreadyin
every
city
and
countryside
this
nation
is
flourishing
workers
are
making
more
money
than
everwith
aftertax
income
in
the
past
years
up
percent
in
the
last
year
alone
up
percent
more
people
are
working
than
ever
before
in
our
historyan
increase
last
year
of
million
jobs
corporations
have
greater
aftertax
earnings
than
ever
in
history
for
the
past
years
those
earnings
have
been
up
over
percent
and
last
year
alone
they
had
a
rise
of
percent
average
farm
income
is
higher
than
ever
over
the
past
years
it
is
up
percent
and
over
the
past
year
it
is
up
percent
alone
i
was
informed
this
afternoon
by
the
distinguished
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
his
preliminary
estimates
indicate
that
our
balance
of
payments
deficit
has
been
reduced
from
billion
in
to
billion
or
less
in
this
achievement
has
been
made
possible
by
the
patriotic
voluntary
cooperation
of
businessmen
and
bankers
working
with
your
government
we
must
now
work
together
with
increased
urgency
to
wipe
out
this
balance
of
payments
deficit
altogether
in
the
next
year
and
as
our
economy
surges
toward
new
heights
we
must
increase
our
vigilance
against
the
inflation
which
raises
the
cost
of
living
and
which
lowers
the
savings
of
every
family
in
this
land
it
is
essential
to
prevent
inflation
that
we
ask
both
labor
and
business
to
exercise
price
and
wage
restraint
and
i
do
so
again
tonight
i
believe
it
desirable
because
of
increased
military
expenditures
that
you
temporarily
restore
the
automobile
and
certain
telephone
excise
tax
reductions
made
effective
only
days
ago
without
raising
taxesor
even
increasing
the
total
tax
bill
paidwe
should
move
to
improve
our
withholding
system
so
that
americans
can
more
realistically
pay
as
they
go
speed
up
the
collection
of
corporate
taxes
and
make
other
necessary
simplifications
of
the
tax
structure
at
an
early
date
i
hope
these
measures
will
be
adequate
but
if
the
necessities
of
vietnam
require
it
i
will
not
hesitate
to
return
to
the
congress
for
additional
appropriations
or
additional
revenues
if
they
are
needed
i
propose
legislation
to
establish
unavoidable
requirements
for
nondiscriminatory
jury
selection
in
federal
and
state
courtsand
to
give
the
attorney
general
the
power
necessary
to
enforce
those
requirements
i
propose
legislation
to
strengthen
authority
of
federal
courts
to
try
those
who
murder
attack
or
intimidate
either
civil
rights
workers
or
others
exercising
their
constitutional
rightsand
to
increase
penalties
to
a
level
equal
to
the
nature
of
the
crime
legislation
resting
on
the
fullest
constitutional
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
prohibit
racial
discrimination
in
the
sale
or
rental
of
housing
for
that
other
nation
within
a
nationthe
poorwhose
distress
has
now
captured
the
conscience
of
america
i
will
ask
the
congress
not
only
to
continue
but
to
speed
up
the
war
on
poverty
and
in
so
doing
we
will
provide
the
added
energy
of
achievement
with
the
increased
efficiency
of
experience
to
improve
the
life
of
our
rural
americans
and
our
farm
population
we
will
plan
for
the
future
through
the
establishment
of
several
new
community
development
districts
improved
education
through
the
use
of
teacher
corps
teams
better
health
measures
physical
examinations
and
adequate
and
available
medical
resources
for
those
who
labor
i
propose
to
improve
unemployment
insurance
to
expand
minimum
wage
benefits
and
by
the
repeal
of
section
b
of
the
tafthartley
act
to
make
the
labor
laws
in
all
our
states
equal
to
the
laws
of
the
states
which
do
not
have
tonight
righttowork
measures
and
i
also
intend
to
ask
the
congress
to
consider
measures
which
without
improperly
invading
state
and
local
authority
will
enable
us
effectively
to
deal
with
strikes
which
threaten
irreparable
damage
to
the
national
interest
yet
slowly
painfully
on
the
edge
of
victory
has
come
the
knowledge
that
shared
prosperity
is
not
enough
in
the
midst
of
abundance
modern
man
walks
oppressed
by
forces
which
menace
and
confine
the
quality
of
his
life
and
which
individual
abundance
alone
will
not
overcome
we
can
subdue
and
we
can
master
these
forcesbring
increased
meaning
to
our
livesif
all
of
us
government
and
citizens
are
bold
enough
to
change
old
ways
daring
enough
to
assault
new
dangers
and
if
the
dream
is
dear
enough
to
call
forth
the
limitless
capacities
of
this
great
people
this
year

we
must
continue
to
improve
the
quality
of
american
life
let
us
fulfill
and
improve
the
great
health
and
education
programs
of
last
year
extending
special
opportunities
to
those
who
risk
their
lives
in
our
armed
forces
i
urge
the
house
of
representatives
to
complete
action
on
three
programs
already
passed
by
the
senatethe
teacher
corps
rent
assistance
and
home
rule
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
some
of
our
urban
areas
we
must
help
rebuild
entire
sections
and
neighborhoods
containing
in
some
cases
as
many
as
people
working
together
private
enterprise
and
government
must
press
forward
with
the
task
of
providing
homes
and
shops
parks
and
hospitals
and
all
the
other
necessary
parts
of
a
flourishing
community
where
our
people
can
come
to
live
the
good
life
i
will
offer
other
proposals
to
stimulate
and
to
reward
planning
for
the
growth
of
entire
metropolitan
areas
of
all
the
reckless
devastations
of
our
national
heritage
none
is
really
more
shameful
than
the
continued
poisoning
of
our
rivers
and
our
air
we
must
undertake
a
cooperative
effort
to
end
pollution
in
several
river
basins
making
additional
funds
available
to
help
draw
the
plans
and
construct
the
plants
that
are
necessary
to
make
the
waters
of
our
entire
river
systems
clean
and
make
them
a
source
of
pleasure
and
beauty
for
all
of
our
people
to
attack
and
to
overcome
growing
crime
and
lawlessness
i
think
we
must
have
a
steppedup
program
to
help
modernize
and
strengthen
our
local
police
forces
our
people
have
a
right
to
feel
secure
in
their
homes
and
on
their
streetsand
that
right
just
must
be
secured
nor
can
we
fail
to
arrest
the
destruction
of
life
and
property
on
our
highways
i
will
propose
a
highway
safety
act
of
to
seek
an
end
to
this
mounting
tragedy
we
must
also
act
to
prevent
the
deception
of
the
american
consumerrequiring
all
packages
to
state
clearly
and
truthfully
their
contentsall
interest
and
credit
charges
to
be
fully
revealedand
keeping
harmful
drugs
and
cosmetics
away
from
our
stores
it
is
the
genius
of
our
constitution
that
under
its
shelter
of
enduring
institutions
and
rooted
principles
there
is
ample
room
for
the
rich
fertility
of
american
political
invention
we
must
change
to
master
change
i
propose
to
take
steps
to
modernize
and
streamline
the
executive
branch
to
modernize
the
relations
between
city
and
state
and
nation
a
new
department
of
transportation
is
needed
to
bring
together
our
transportation
activities
the
present
structure
government
agencies
spending
billion
yearlymakes
it
almost
impossible
to
serve
either
the
growing
demands
of
this
great
nation
or
the
needs
of
the
industry
or
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
full
efficiency
and
real
frugality
i
will
propose
in
addition
a
program
to
construct
and
to
flighttest
a
new
supersonic
transport
airplane
that
will
fly
three
times
the
speed
of
soundin
excess
of
miles
per
hour
i
propose
to
examine
our
federal
systemthe
relation
between
city
state
nation
and
the
citizens
themselves
we
need
a
commission
of
the
most
distinguished
scholars
and
men
of
public
affairs
to
do
this
job
i
will
ask
them
to
move
on
to
develop
a
creative
federalism
to
best
use
the
wonderful
diversity
of
our
institutions
and
our
people
to
solve
the
problems
and
to
fulfill
the
dreams
of
the
american
people
as
the
process
of
election
becomes
more
complex
and
more
costly
we
must
make
it
possible
for
those
without
personal
wealth
to
enter
public
life
without
being
obligated
to
a
few
large
contributors
therefore
i
will
submit
legislation
to
revise
the
present
unrealistic
restriction
on
contributionsto
prohibit
the
endless
proliferation
of
committees
bringing
local
and
state
committees
under
the
actto
attach
strong
teeth
and
severe
penalties
to
the
requirement
of
full
disclosure
of
contributionsand
to
broaden
the
participation
of
the
people
through
added
tax
incentives
to
stimulate
small
contributions
to
the
party
and
to
the
candidate
of
their
choice
to
strengthen
the
work
of
congress
i
strongly
urge
an
amendment
to
provide
a
year
term
for
members
of
the
house
of
representativeswhich
should
not
begin
before
the
present
year
term
requires
most
members
of
congress
to
divert
enormous
energies
to
an
almost
constant
process
of
campaigningdepriving
this
nation
of
the
fullest
measure
of
both
their
skill
and
their
wisdom
today
too
the
work
of
government
is
far
more
complex
than
in
our
early
years
requiring
more
time
to
learn
and
more
time
to
master
the
technical
tasks
of
legislating
and
a
longer
term
will
serve
to
attract
more
men
of
the
highest
quality
to
political
life
the
nation
the
principle
of
democracy
and
i
think
each
congressional
district
will
all
be
better
served
by
a
year
term
for
members
of
the
house
and
i
urge
your
swift
action
iv
tonight
the
cup
of
peril
is
full
in
vietnam
that
conflict
is
not
an
isolated
episode
but
another
great
event
in
the
policy
that
we
have
followed
with
strong
consistency
since
world
war
ii
the
touchstone
of
that
policy
is
the
interest
of
the
united
statesthe
welfare
and
the
freedom
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
but
nations
sink
when
they
see
that
interest
only
through
a
narrow
glass
in
a
world
that
has
grown
small
and
dangerous
pursuit
of
narrow
aims
could
bring
decay
and
even
disaster
an
america
that
is
mighty
beyond
descriptionyet
living
in
a
hostile
or
despairing
worldwould
be
neither
safe
nor
free
to
build
a
civilization
to
liberate
the
spirit
of
man
in
this
pursuit
we
helped
rebuild
western
europe
we
gave
our
aid
to
greece
and
turkey
and
we
defended
the
freedom
of
berlin
in
this
pursuit
we
have
helped
new
nations
toward
independence
we
have
extended
the
helping
hand
of
the
peace
corps
and
carried
forward
the
largest
program
of
economic
assistance
in
the
world
and
in
this
pursuit
we
work
to
build
a
hemisphere
of
democracy
and
of
social
justice
in
this
pursuit
we
have
defended
against
communist
aggressionin
korea
under
president
trumanin
the
formosa
straits
under
president
eisenhowerin
cuba
under
president
kennedyand
again
in
vietnam
tonight
vietnam
must
hold
the
center
of
our
attention
but
across
the
world
problems
and
opportunities
crowd
in
on
the
american
nation
i
will
discuss
them
fully
in
the
months
to
come
and
i
will
follow
the
five
continuing
lines
of
policy
that
america
has
followed
under
its
last
four
presidents
while
special
vietnam
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
are
estimated
to
increase
by
billion
i
can
tell
you
that
all
the
other
expenditures
put
together
in
the
entire
federal
budget
will
rise
this
coming
year
by
only
billion
this
is
true
because
of
the
stringent
costconscious
economy
program
inaugurated
in
the
defense
department
and
followed
by
the
other
departments
of
government
we
will
vigorously
pursue
existing
proposalsand
seek
new
onesto
control
arms
and
to
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
by
strengthening
the
common
defense
by
stimulating
world
commerce
by
meeting
new
hopes
these
associations
serve
the
cause
of
a
flourishing
world
we
will
take
new
steps
this
year
to
help
strengthen
the
alliance
for
progress
the
unity
of
europe
the
community
of
the
atlantic
the
regional
organizations
of
developing
continents
and
that
supreme
associationthe
united
nations
we
will
work
to
strengthen
economic
cooperation
to
reduce
barriers
to
trade
and
to
improve
international
finance
from
the
marshall
plan
to
this
very
moment
tonight
that
policy
has
rested
on
the
claims
of
compassion
and
the
certain
knowledge
that
only
a
people
advancing
in
expectation
will
build
secure
and
peaceful
lands
this
year
i
propose
major
new
directions
in
our
program
of
foreign
assistance
to
help
those
countries
who
will
help
themselves
we
will
conduct
a
worldwide
attack
on
the
problems
of
hunger
and
disease
and
ignorance
we
will
place
the
matchless
skill
and
the
resources
of
our
own
great
america
in
farming
and
in
fertilizers
at
the
service
of
those
countries
committed
to
develop
a
modern
agriculture
we
will
aid
those
who
educate
the
young
in
other
lands
and
we
will
give
children
in
other
continents
the
same
head
start
that
we
are
trying
to
give
our
own
children
to
advance
these
ends
i
will
propose
the
international
education
act
of
i
will
also
propose
the
international
health
act
of
to
strike
at
disease
by
a
new
effort
to
bring
modern
skills
and
knowledge
to
the
uncaredfor
those
suffering
in
the
world
and
by
trying
to
wipe
out
smallpox
and
malaria
and
control
yellow
fever
over
most
of
the
world
during
this
next
decade
to
help
countries
trying
to
control
population
growth
by
increasing
our
researchand
we
will
earmark
funds
to
help
their
efforts
in
the
next
year
from
our
foreign
aid
sources
we
propose
to
dedicate
billion
to
these
efforts
and
we
call
on
all
who
have
the
means
to
join
us
in
this
work
in
the
world
for
a
peaceful
world
order
will
be
possible
only
when
each
country
walks
the
way
that
it
has
chosen
to
walk
for
itself
we
follow
this
principle
by
encouraging
the
end
of
colonial
rule
we
follow
this
principle
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
by
continued
hostility
to
the
rule
of
the
many
by
the
fewor
the
oppression
of
one
race
by
another
we
follow
this
principle
by
building
bridges
to
eastern
europe
and
i
will
ask
the
congress
for
authority
to
remove
the
special
tariff
restrictions
which
are
a
barrier
to
increasing
trade
between
the
east
and
the
west
the
insistent
urge
toward
national
independence
is
the
strongest
force
of
todays
world
in
which
we
live
in
africa
and
asia
and
latin
america
it
is
shattering
the
designs
of
those
who
would
subdue
others
to
their
ideas
or
their
will
it
is
eroding
the
unity
of
what
was
once
a
stalinist
empire
in
recent
months
a
number
of
nations
have
east
out
those
who
would
subject
them
to
the
ambitions
of
mainland
china
history
is
on
the
side
of
freedom
and
is
on
the
side
of
societies
shaped
from
the
genius
of
each
people
history
does
not
favor
a
single
system
or
beliefunless
force
is
used
to
make
it
so
that
is
why
it
has
been
necessary
for
us
to
defend
this
basic
principle
of
our
policy
to
defend
it
in
berlin
in
korea
in
cubaand
tonight
in
vietnam
for
tonight
as
so
many

nights
before
young
americans
struggle
and
young
americans
die
in
a
distant
land
tonight
as
so
many
nights
before
the
american
nation
is
asked
to
sacrifice
the
blood
of
its
children
and
the
fruits
of
its
labor
for
the
love
of
its
freedom
how
many
timesin
my
lifetime
and
in
yourshave
the
american
people
gathered
as
they
do
now
to
hear
their
president
tell
them
of
conflict
and
tell
them
of
danger
each
time
they
have
answered
they
have
answered
with
all
the
effort
that
the
security
and
the
freedom
of
this
nation
required
and
they
do
again
tonight
in
vietnam
not
too
many
years
ago
vietnam
was
a
peaceful
if
troubled
land
in
the
north
was
an
independent
communist
government
in
the
south
a
people
struggled
to
build
a
nation
with
the
friendly
help
of
the
united
states
there
were
some
in
south
vietnam
who
wished
to
force
communist
rule
on
their
own
people
but
their
progress
was
slight
their
hope
of
success
was
dim
then
little
more
than
years
ago
north
vietnam
decided
on
conquest
and
from
that
day
to
this
soldiers
and
supplies
have
moved
from
north
to
south
in
a
swelling
stream
that
is
swallowing
the
remnants
of
revolution
in
aggression
as
the
assault
mounted
our
choice
gradually
became
clear
we
could
leave
abandoning
south
vietnam
to
its
attackers
and
to
certain
conquest
or
we
could
stay
and
fight
beside
the
people
of
south
vietnam
we
stayed
and
we
will
stay
until
aggression
has
stopped
we
will
stay
because
a
just
nation
cannot
leave
to
the
cruelties
of
its
enemies
a
people
who
have
staked
their
lives
and
independence
on
americas
solemn
pledgea
pledge
which
has
grown
through
the
commitments
of
three
american
presidents
we
will
stay
because
in
asia
and
around
the
world
are
countries
whose
independence
rests
in
large
measure
on
confidence
in
americas
word
and
in
americas
protection
to
yield
to
force
in
vietnam
would
weaken
that
confidence
would
undermine
the
independence
of
many
lands
and
would
whet
the
appetite
of
aggression
we
would
have
to
fight
in
one
land
and
then
we
would
have
to
fight
in
anotheror
abandon
much
of
asia
to
the
domination
of
communists
and
we
do
not
intend
to
abandon
asia
to
conquest
last
year
the
nature
of
the
war
in
vietnam
changed
again
swiftly
increasing
numbers
of
armed
men
from
the
north
crossed
the
borders
to
join
forces
that
were
already
in
the
south
attack
and
terror
increased
spurred
and
encouraged
by
the
belief
that
the
united
states
lacked
the
will
to
continue
and
that
their
victory
was
near
despite
our
desire
to
limit
conflict
it
was
necessary
to
act
to
hold
back
the
mounting
aggression
to
give
courage
to
the
people
of
the
south
and
to
make
our
firmness
clear
to
the
north
thus
we
began
limited
air
action
against
military
targets
in
north
vietnam
we
increased
our
fighting
force
to
its
present
strength
tonight
of
men
these
moves
have
not
ended
the
aggression
but
they
have
prevented
its
success
the
aims
of
the
enemy
have
been
put
out
of
reach
by
the
skill
and
the
bravery
of
americans
and
their
alliesand
by
the
enduring
courage
of
the
south
vietnamese
who
i
can
tell
you
have
lost
eight
men
last
year
for
every
one
of
ours
the
enemy
is
no
longer
close
to
victory
time
is
no
longer
on
his
side
there
is
no
cause
to
doubt
the
american
commitment
our
decision
to
stand
firm
has
been
matched
by
our
desire
for
peace
in
alone
we
had
private
talks
for
peace
in
vietnam
with
friends
and
adversaries
throughout
the
world
since
christmas
your
government
has
labored
again
with
imagination
and
endurance
to
remove
any
barrier
to
peaceful
settlement
for
days
now
we
and
our
vietnamese
allies
have
dropped
no
bombs
in
north
vietnam
able
and
experienced
spokesmen
have
visited
in
behalf
of
america
more
than
countries
we
have
talked
to
more
than
a
hundred
governments
all
that
we
have
relations
with
and
some
that
we
dont
we
have
talked
to
the
united
nations
and
we
have
called
upon
all
of
its
members
to
make
any
contribution
that
they
can
toward
helping
obtain
peace
in
public
statements
and
in
private
communications
to
adversaries
and
to
friends
in
rome
and
warsaw
in
paris
and
tokyo
in
africa
and
throughout
this
hemisphere
america
has
made
her
position
abundantly
clear
we
seek
neither
territory
nor
bases
economic
domination
or
military
alliance
in
vietnam
we
fight
for
the
principle
of
selfdeterminationthat
the
people
of
south
vietnam
should
be
able
to
choose
their
own
course
choose
it
in
free
elections
without
violence
without
terror
and
without
fear
the
people
of
all
vietnam
should
make
a
free
decision
on
the
great
question
of
reunification
this
is
all
we
want
for
south
vietnam
it
is
all
the
people
of
south
vietnam
want
and
if
there
is
a
single
nation
on
this
earth
that
desires
less
than
this
for
its
own
people
then
let
its
voice
be
heard
we
have
also
made
it
clearfrom
hanoi
to
new
yorkthat
there
are
no
arbitrary
limits
to
our
search
for
peace
we
stand
by
the
geneva
agreements
of
and
we
will
meet
at
any
conference
table
we
will
discuss
any
proposalsfour
points
or
fourteen
or
fortyand
we
will
consider
the
views
of
any
group
we
will
work
for
a
ceasefire
now
or
once
discussions
have
begun
we
will
respond
if
others
reduce
their
use
of
force
and
we
will
withdraw
our
soldiers
once
south
vietnam
is
securely
guaranteed
the
right
to
shape
its
own
future
we
have
said
all
this
and
we
have
askedand
hopedand
we
have
waited
for
a
response
so
far
we
have
received
no
response
to
prove
either
success
or
failure
we
have
carried
our
quest
for
peace
to
many
nations
and
peoples
because
we
share
this
planet
with
others
whose
future
in
large
measure
is
tied
to
our
own
action
and
whose
counsel
is
necessary
to
our
own
hopes
we
have
found
understanding
and
support
and
we
know
they
wait
with
us
tonight
for
some
response
that
could
lead
to
peace
i
wish
tonight
that
i
could
give
you
a
blueprint
for
the
course
of
this
conflict
over
the
coming
months
but
we
just
cannot
know
what
the
future
may
require
we
may
have
to
face
long
hard
combat
or
a
long
hard
conference
or
even
both
at
once
until
peace
comes
or
if
it
does
not
come
our
course
is
clear
we
will
act
as
we
must
to
help
protect
the
independence
of
the
valiant
people
of
south
vietnam
we
will
strive
to
limit
the
conflict
for
we
wish
neither
increased
destruction
nor
do
we
want
to
invite
increased
danger
but
we
will
give
our
fighting
men
what
they
must
have
every
gun
and
every
dollar
and
every
decisionwhatever
the
cost
or
whatever
the
challenge
and
we
will
continue
to
help
the
people
of
south
vietnam
care
for
those
that
are
ravaged
by
battle
create
progress
in
the
villages
and
carry
forward
the
healing
hopes
of
peace
as
best
they
can
amidst
the
uncertain
terrors
of
war
and
let
me
be
absolutely
clear
the
days
may
become
months
and
the
months
may
become
years
but
we
will
stay
as
long
as
aggression
commands
us
to
battle
there
may
be
some
who
do
not
want
peace
whose
ambitions
stretch
so
far
that
war
in
vietnam
is
but
a
welcome
and
convenient
episode
in
an
immense
design
to
subdue
history
to
their
will
but
for
others
it
must
now
be
clearthe
choice
is
not
between
peace
and
victory
it
lies
between
peace
and
the
ravages
of
a
conflict
from
which
they
can
only
lose
the
people
of
vietnam
north
and
south
seek
the
same
things
the
shared
needs
of
man
the
needs
for
food
and
shelter
and
educationthe
chance
to
build
and
work
and
till
the
soil
free
from
the
arbitrary
horrors
of
battlethe
desire
to
walk
in
the
dignity
of
those
who
master
their
own
destiny
for
many
painful
years
in
war
and
revolution
and
infrequent
peace
they
have
struggled
to
fulfill
those
needs
it
is
a
crime
against
mankind
that
so
much
courage
and
so
much
will
and
so
many
dreams
must
be
flung
on
the
fires
of
war
and
death
to
all
of
those
caught
up
in
this
conflict
we
therefore
say
again
tonight
let
us
choose
peace
and
with
it
the
wondrous
works
of
peace
and
beyond
that
the
time
when
hope
reaches
toward
consummation
and
life
is
the
servant
of
life
in
this
work
we
plan
to
discharge
our
duty
to
the
people
whom
we
serve
v
this
is
the
state
of
the
union
but
over
it
allwealth
and
promise
and
expectationlies
our
troubling
awareness
of
american
men
at
war
tonight
how
many
men
who
listen
to
me
tonight
have
served
their
nation
in
other
wars
how
very
many
are
not
here
to
listen
the
war
in
vietnam
is
not
like
these
other
wars
yet
finally
war
is
always
the
same
it
is
young
men
dying
in
the
fullness
of
their
promise
it
is
trying
to
kill
a
man
that
you
do
not
even
know
well
enough
to
hate
therefore
to
know
war
is
to
know
that
there
is
still
madness
in
this
world
many
of
you
share
the
burden
of
this
knowledge
tonight
with
me
but
there
is
a
difference
for
finally
i
must
be
the
one
to
order
our
guns
to
fire
against
all
the
most
inward
pulls
of
my
desire
for
we
have
children
to
teach
and
we
have
sick
to
be
cured
and
we
have
men
to
be
freed
there
are
poor
to
be
lifted
up
and
there
are
cities
to
be
built
and
there
is
a
world
to
be
helped
yet
we
do
what
we
must
i
am
hopeful
and
i
will
try
as
best
i
can
with
everything
i
have
got
to
end
this
battle
and
to
return
our
sons
to
their
desires
yet
as
long
as
others
will
challenge
americas
security
and
test
the
clearness
of
our
beliefs
with
fire
and
steel
then
we
must
stand
or
see
the
promise
of
two
centuries
tremble
i
believe
tonight
that
you
do
not
want
me
to
try
that
risk
and
from
that
belief
your
president
summons
his
strength
for
the
trials
that
lie
ahead
in
the
days
to
come
the
work
must
be
our
work
now
scarred
by
the
weaknesses
of
man
with
whatever
guidance
god
may
offer
us
we
must
nevertheless
and
alone
with
our
mortality
strive
to
ennoble
the
life
of
man
on
earth
thank
you
and
goodnight

on
this
hill
which
was
my
home
i
am
stirred
by
old
friendships
though
total
agreement
between
the
executive
and
the
congress
is
impossible
total
respect
is
important
i
am
proud
to
be
among
my
colleagues
of
the
congress
whose
legacy
to
their
trust
is
their
loyalty
to
their
nation
i
am
not
unaware
of
the
inner
emotions
of
the
new
members
of
this
body
tonight
twentyeight
years
ago
i
felt
as
you
do
now
you
will
soon
learn
that
you
are
among
men
whose
first
love
is
their
country
men
who
try
each
day
to
do
as
best
they
can
what
they
believe
is
right
we
are
entering
the
third
century
of
the
pursuit
of
american
union
two
hundred
years
ago
in
nine
assembled
colonies
first
joined
together
to
demand
freedom
from
arbitrary
power
for
the
first
century
we
struggled
to
hold
together
the
first
continental
union
of
democracy
in
the
history
of
man
one
hundred
years
ago
in
following
a
terrible
test
of
blood
and
fire
the
compact
of
union
was
finally
sealed
for
a
second
century
we
labored
to
establish
a
unity
of
purpose
and
interest
among
the
many
groups
which
make
up
the
american
community
that
struggle
has
often
brought
pain
and
violence
it
is
not
yet
over
but
we
have
achieved
a
unity
of
interest
among
our
people
that
is
unmatched
in
the
history
of
freedom
and
so
tonight
now
in
we
begin
a
new
quest
for
union
we
seek
the
unity
of
man
with
the
world
that
he
has
builtwith
the
knowledge
that
can
save
or
destroy
himwith
the
cities
which
can
stimulate
or
stifle
himwith
the
wealth
and
the
machines
which
can
enrich
or
menace
his
spirit
we
seek
to
establish
a
harmony
between
man
and
society
which
will
allow
each
of
us
to
enlarge
the
meaning
of
his
life
and
all
of
us
to
elevate
the
quality
of
our
civilization
this
is
the
search
that
we
begin
tonight
state
of
the
world
but
the
unity
we
seek
cannot
realize
its
full
promise
in
isolation
for
today
the
state
of
the
union
depends
in
large
measure
upon
the
state
of
the
world
our
concern
and
interest
compassion
and
vigilance
extend
to
every
corner
of
a
dwindling
planet
yet
it
is
not
merely
our
concern
but
the
concern
of
all
free
men
we
will
not
and
we
should
not
assume
that
it
is
the
task
of
americans
alone
to
settle
all
the
conflicts
of
a
torn
and
troubled
world
let
the
foes
of
freedom
take
no
comfort
from
this
for
in
concert
with
other
nations
we
shall
help
men
defend
their
freedom
our
first
aim
remains
the
safety
and
the
wellbeing
of
our
own
country
we
are
prepared
to
live
as
good
neighbors
with
all
but
we
cannot
be
indifferent
to
acts
designed
to
injure
our
interests
or
our
citizens
or
our
establishments
abroad
the
community
of
nations
requires
mutual
respect
we
shall
extend
itand
we
shall
expect
it
in
our
relations
with
the
world
we
shall
follow
the
example
of
andrew
jackson
who
said
i
intend
to
ask
for
nothing
that
is
not
clearly
right
and
to
submit
to
nothing
that
is
wrong
and
he
promised
that
the
honor
of
my
country
shall
never
be
stained
by
an
apology
from
me
for
the
statement
of
truth
or
for
the
performance
of
duty
that
was
this
nations
policy
in
the
s
and
that
is
this
nations
policy
in
the
s
our
own
freedom
and
growth
have
never
been
the
final
goal
of
the
american
dream
we
were
never
meant
to
be
an
oasis
of
liberty
and
abundance
in
a
worldwide
desert
of
disappointed
dreams
our
nation
was
created
to
help
strike
away
the
chains
of
ignorance
and
misery
and
tyranny
wherever
they
keep
man
less
than
god
means
him
to
be
we
are
moving
toward
that
destiny
never
more
rapidly
than
we
have
moved
in
the
last
years
in
this
period
we
have
built
a
military
power
strong
enough
to
meet
any
threat
and
destroy
any
adversary
and
that
superiority
will
continue
to
grow
so
long
as
this
office
is
mineand
you
sit
on
capitol
hill
in
this
period
no
new
nation
has
become
communist
and
the
unity
of
the
communist
empire
has
begun
to
crumble
in
this
period
we
have
resolved
in
friendship
our
disputes
with
our
neighbors
of
the
hemisphere
and
joined
in
an
alliance
for
progress
toward
economic
growth
and
political
democracy
in
this
period
we
have
taken
more
steps
toward
peaceincluding
the
test
ban
treatythan
at
any
time
since
the
cold
war
began
in
this
period
we
have
relentlessly
pursued
our
advances
toward
the
conquest
of
space
most
important
of
all
in
this
period
the
united
states
has
reemerged
into
the
fullness
of
its
selfconfidence
and
purpose
no
longer
are
we
called
upon
to
get
america
moving
we
are
moving
no
longer
do
we
doubt
our
strength
or
resolution
we
are
strong
and
we
have
proven
our
resolve
no
longer
can
anyone
wonder
whether
we
are
in
the
grip
of
historical
decay
we
know
that
history
is
ours
to
make
and
if
there
is
great
danger
there
is
now
also
the
excitement
of
great
expectations
america
and
the
communist
nations
yet
we
still
live
in
a
troubled
and
perilous
world
there
is
no
longer
a
single
threat
there
are
many
they
differ
in
intensity
and
in
danger
they
require
different
attitudes
and
different
answers
with
the
soviet
union
we
seek
peaceful
understandings
that
can
lessen
the
danger
to
freedom
last
fall
i
asked
the
american
people
to
choose
that
course
i
will
carry
forward
their
command
if
we
are
to
live
together
in
peace
we
must
come
to
know
each
other
better
i
am
sure
that
the
american
people
would
welcome
a
chance
to
listen
to
the
soviet
leaders
on
our
televisionas
i
would
like
the
soviet
people
to
hear
our
leaders
on
theirs
i
hope
the
new
soviet
leaders
can
visit
america
so
they
can
learn
about
our
country
at
firsthand
in
eastern
europe
restless
nations
are
slowly
beginning
to
assert
their
identity
your
government
assisted
by
the
leaders
in
american
labor
and
business
is
now
exploring
ways
to
increase
peaceful
trade
with
these
countries
and
with
the
soviet
union
i
will
report
our
conclusions
to
the
congress
in
asia
communism
wears
a
more
aggressive
face
we
see
that
in
vietnam
why
are
we
there
we
are
there
first
because
a
friendly
nation
has
asked
us
for
help
against
the
communist
aggression
ten
years
ago
our
president
pledged
our
help
three
presidents
have
supported
that
pledge
we
will
not
break
it
now
second
our
own
security
is
tied
to
the
peace
of
asia
twice
in
one
generation
we
have
had
to
fight
against
aggression
in
the
far
east
to
ignore
aggression
now
would
only
increase
the
danger
of
a
much
larger
war
our
goal
is
peace
in
southeast
asia
that
will
come
only
when
aggressors
leave
their
neighbors
in
peace
what
is
at
stake
is
the
cause
of
freedom
and
in
that
cause
america
will
never
be
found
wanting
the
noncommunist
world
but
communism
is
not
the
only
source
of
trouble
and
unrest
there
are
older
and
deeper
sourcesin
the
misery
of
nations
and
in
mans
irrepressible
ambition
for
liberty
and
a
better
life
with
the
free
republics
of
latin
america
i
have
always
feltand
my
country
has
always
feltvery
special
ties
of
interest
and
affection
it
will
be
the
purpose
of
my
administration
to
strengthen
these
ties
together
we
share
and
shape
the
destiny
of
the
new
world
in
the
coming
year
i
hope
to
pay
a
visit
to
latin
america
and
i
will
steadily
enlarge
our
commitment
to
the
alliance
for
progress
as
the
instrument
of
our
war
against
poverty
and
injustice
in
this
hemisphere
in
the
atlantic
community
we
continue
to
pursue
our
goal
of
yearsa
europe
that
is
growing
in
strength
unity
and
cooperation
with
america
a
great
unfinished
task
is
the
reunification
of
germany
through
selfdetermination
this
european
policy
is
not
based
on
any
abstract
design
it
is
based
on
the
realities
of
common
interests
and
common
values
common
dangers
and
common
expectations
these
realities
will
continue
to
have
their
wayespecially
i
think
in
our
expanding
trade
and
especially
in
our
common
defense
free
americans
have
shaped
the
policies
of
the
united
states
and
because
we
know
these
realities
those
policies
have
been
and
will
be
in
the
interest
of
europe
free
europeans
must
shape
the
course
of
europe
and
for
the
same
reasons
that
course
has
been
and
will
be
in
our
interest
and
in
the
interest
of
freedom
i
found
this
truth
confirmed
in
my
talks
with
european
leaders
in
the
last
year
i
hope
to
repay
these
visits
to
some
of
our
friends
in
europe
this
year
in
africa
and
asia
we
are
witnessing
the
turbulent
unfolding
of
new
nations
and
continents
we
welcome
them
to
the
society
of
nations
we
are
committed
to
help
those
seeking
to
strengthen
their
own
independence
and
to
work
most
closely
with
those
governments
dedicated
to
the
welfare
of
all
of
their
people
we
seek
not
fidelity
to
an
iron
faith
but
a
diversity
of
belief
as
varied
as
man
himself
we
seek
not
to
extend
the
power
of
america
but
the
progress
of
humanity
we
seek
not
to
dominate
others
but
to
strengthen
the
freedom
of
all
people
i
will
seek
new
ways
to
use
our
knowledge
to
help
deal
with
the
explosion
in
world
population
and
the
growing
scarcity
in
world
resources
finally
we
renew
our
commitment
to
the
continued
growth
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
united
nations
the
frustrations
of
the
united
nations
are
a
product
of
the
world
that
we
live
in
and
not
of
the
institution
which
gives
them
voice
it
is
far
better
to
throw
these
differences
open
to
the
assembly
of
nations
than
to
permit
them
to
fester
in
silent
danger
these
are
some
of
the
goals
of
the
american
nation
in
the
world
in
which
we
live
for
ourselves
we
seek
neither
praise
nor
blame
neither
gratitude
nor
obedience
we
seek
peace
we
seek
freedom
we
seek
to
enrich
the
life
of
man
for
that
is
the
world
in
which
we
will
flourish
and
that
is
the
world
that
we
mean
for
all
men
to
ultimately
have
toward
the
great
society
world
affairs
will
continue
to
call
upon
our
energy
and
our
courage
but
today
we
can
turn
increased
attention
to
the
character
of
american
life
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
upward
surge
of
economic
wellbeing
in
the
history
of
any
nation
our
flourishing
progress
has
been
marked
by
price
stability
that
is
unequalled
in
the
world
our
balance
of
payments
deficit
has
declined
and
the
soundness
of
our
dollar
is
unquestioned
i
pledge
to
keep
it
that
way
and
i
urge
business
and
labor
to
cooperate
to
that
end
we
worked

for
two
centuries
to
climb
this
peak
of
prosperity
but
we
are
only
at
the
beginning
of
the
road
to
the
great
society
ahead
now
is
a
summit
where
freedom
from
the
wants
of
the
body
can
help
fulfill
the
needs
of
the
spirit
we
built
this
nation
to
serve
its
people
we
want
to
grow
and
build
and
create
but
we
want
progress
to
be
the
servant
and
not
the
master
of
man
we
do
not
intend
to
live
in
the
midst
of
abundance
isolated
from
neighbors
and
nature
confined
by
blighted
cities
and
bleak
suburbs
stunted
by
a
poverty
of
learning
and
an
emptiness
of
leisure
the
great
society
asks
not
how
much
but
how
good
not
only
how
to
create
wealth
but
how
to
use
it
not
only
how
fast
we
are
going
but
where
we
are
headed
it
proposes
as
the
first
test
for
a
nation
the
quality
of
its
people
this
kind
of
society
will
not
flower
spontaneously
from
swelling
riches
and
surging
power
it
will
not
be
the
gift
of
government
or
the
creation
of
presidents
it
will
require
of
every
american
for
many
generations
both
faith
in
the
destination
and
the
fortitude
to
make
the
journey
and
like
freedom
itself
it
will
always
be
challenge
and
not
fulfillment
and
tonight
we
accept
that
challenge
a
national
agenda
i
propose
that
we
begin
a
program
in
education
to
ensure
every
american
child
the
fullest
development
of
his
mind
and
skills
i
propose
that
we
begin
a
massive
attack
on
crippling
and
killing
diseases
i
propose
that
we
launch
a
national
effort
to
make
the
american
city
a
better
and
a
more
stimulating
place
to
live
i
propose
that
we
increase
the
beauty
of
america
and
end
the
poisoning
of
our
rivers
and
the
air
that
we
breathe
i
propose
that
we
carry
out
a
new
program
to
develop
regions
of
our
country
that
are
now
suffering
from
distress
and
depression
i
propose
that
we
make
new
efforts
to
control
and
prevent
crime
and
delinquency
i
propose
that
we
eliminate
every
remaining
obstacle
to
the
right
and
the
opportunity
to
vote
i
propose
that
we
honor
and
support
the
achievements
of
thought
and
the
creations
of
art
i
propose
that
we
make
an
allout
campaign
against
waste
and
inefficiency
the
task
our
basic
task
is
threefold
first
to
keep
our
economy
growing
to
open
for
all
americans
the
opportunity
that
is
now
enjoyed
by
most
americans
and
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
all
in
the
next
weeks
i
will
submit
special
messages
with
detailed
proposals
for
national
action
in
each
of
these
areas
tonight
i
would
like
just
briefly
to
explain
some
of
my
major
recommendations
in
the
three
main
areas
of
national
need
a
growing
economy
basic
policies
first
we
must
keep
our
nation
prosperous
we
seek
full
employment
opportunity
for
every
american
citizen
i
will
present
a
budget
designed
to
move
the
economy
forward
more
money
will
be
left
in
the
hands
of
the
consumer
by
a
substantial
cut
in
excise
taxes
we
will
continue
along
the
path
toward
a
balanced
budget
in
a
balanced
economy
i
confidently
predictwhat
every
economic
sign
tells
us
tonightthe
continued
flourishing
of
the
american
economy
but
we
must
remember
that
fear
of
a
recession
can
contribute
to
the
fact
of
a
recession
the
knowledge
that
our
government
will
and
can
move
swiftly
will
strengthen
the
confidence
of
investors
and
business
congress
can
reinforce
this
confidence
by
insuring
that
its
procedures
permit
rapid
action
on
temporary
income
tax
cuts
and
special
funds
for
jobcreating
public
programs
should
be
made
available
for
immediate
use
if
recession
threatens
our
continued
prosperity
demands
continued
price
stability
business
labor
and
the
consumer
all
have
a
high
stake
in
keeping
wages
and
prices
within
the
framework
of
the
guideposts
that
have
already
served
the
nation
so
well
finding
new
markets
abroad
for
our
goods
depends
on
the
initiative
of
american
business
but
we
stand
readywith
credit
and
other
helpto
assist
the
flow
of
trade
which
will
benefit
the
entire
nation
on
the
farms
our
economy
owes
much
to
the
efficiency
of
our
farmers
we
must
continue
to
assure
them
the
opportunity
to
earn
a
fair
reward
i
have
instructed
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
lead
a
major
effort
to
find
new
approaches
to
reduce
the
heavy
cost
of
our
farm
programs
and
to
direct
more
of
our
effort
to
the
small
farmer
who
needs
the
help
the
most
increased
prosperity
we
can
help
insure
continued
prosperity
through
a
regional
recovery
program
to
assist
the
development
of
stricken
areas
left
behind
by
our
national
progress
further
efforts
to
provide
our
workers
with
the
skills
demanded
by
modern
technology
for
the
laboringman
is
an
indispensable
force
in
the
american
system
the
extension
of
the
minimum
wage
to
more
than
million
unprotected
workers
the
improvement
and
the
modernization
of
the
unemployment
compensation
system
and
as
pledged
in
our
and
democratic
platforms
i
will
propose
to
congress
changes
in
the
tafthartley
act
including
section
b
i
will
do
so
hoping
to
reduce
the
conflicts
that
for
several
years
have
divided
americans
in
various
states
of
our
union
in
a
country
that
spans
a
continent
modern
transportation
is
vital
to
continued
growth
transportation
for
growth
i
will
recommend
heavier
reliance
on
competition
in
transportation
and
a
new
policy
for
our
merchant
marine
i
will
ask
for
funds
to
study
highspeed
rail
transportation
between
urban
centers
we
will
begin
with
test
projects
between
washington
and
boston
on
highspeed
trains
passengers
could
travel
this
distance
in
less
than
hours
ii
opportunity
for
all
second
we
must
open
opportunity
to
all
our
people
most
americans
enjoy
a
good
life
but
far
too
many
are
still
trapped
in
poverty
and
idleness
and
fear
let
a
just
nation
throw
open
to
them
the
city
of
promise
to
the
elderly
by
providing
hospital
care
under
social
security
and
by
raising
benefit
payments
to
those
struggling
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
their
later
years
to
the
poor
and
the
unfortunate
through
doubling
the
war
against
poverty
this
year
to
negro
americans
through
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
law
and
elimination
of
barriers
to
the
right
to
vote
to
those
in
other
lands
that
are
seeking
the
promise
of
america
through
an
immigration
law
based
on
the
work
a
man
can
do
and
not
where
he
was
born
or
how
he
spells
his
name
iii
to
enrich
the
life
of
all
our
third
goal
is
to
improve
the
quality
of
american
life
through
education
we
begin
with
learning
every
child
must
have
the
best
education
that
this
nation
can
provide
thomas
jefferson
said
that
no
nation
can
be
both
ignorant
and
free
today
no
nation
can
be
both
ignorant
and
great
in
addition
to
our
existing
programs
i
will
recommend
a
new
program
for
schools
and
students
with
a
first
year
authorization
of
million
it
will
help
at
every
stage
along
the
road
to
learning
for
the
preschool
years
we
will
help
needy
children
become
aware
of
the
excitement
of
learning
for
the
primary
and
secondary
school
years
we
will
aid
public
schools
serving
lowincome
families
and
assist
students
in
both
public
and
private
schools
for
the
college
years
we
will
provide
scholarships
to
high
school
students
of
the
greatest
promise
and
the
greatest
need
and
we
will
guarantee
lowinterest
loans
to
students
continuing
their
college
studies
new
laboratories
and
centers
will
help
our
schoolshelp
them
lift
their
standards
of
excellence
and
explore
new
methods
of
teaching
these
centers
will
provide
special
training
for
those
who
need
and
those
who
deserve
special
treatment
through
better
health
greatness
requires
not
only
an
educated
people
but
a
healthy
people
our
goal
is
to
match
the
achievements
of
our
medicine
to
the
afflictions
of
our
people
we
already
carry
on
a
large
program
in
this
country
for
research
and
health
in
addition
regional
medical
centers
can
provide
the
most
advanced
diagnosis
and
treatment
for
heart
disease
and
cancer
and
stroke
and
other
major
diseases
new
support
for
medical
and
dental
education
will
provide
the
trained
people
to
apply
our
knowledge
community
centers
can
help
the
mentally
ill
and
improve
health
care
for
schoolage
children
from
poor
families
including
services
for
the
mentally
retarded
through
improving
the
world
we
live
in
the
city
an
educated
and
healthy
people
require
surroundings
in
harmony
with
their
hopes
in
our
urban
areas
the
central
problem
today
is
to
protect
and
restore
mans
satisfaction
in
belonging
to
a
community
where
he
can
find
security
and
significance
the
first
step
is
to
break
old
patternsto
begin
to
think
and
work
and
plan
for
the
development
of
the
entire
metropolitan
areas
we
will
take
this
step
with
new
programs
of
help
for
the
basic
community
facilities
and
for
neighborhood
centers
of
health
and
recreation
new
and
existing
programs
will
be
open
to
those
cities
which
work
together
to
develop
unified
longrange
policies
for
metropolitan
areas
we
must
also
make
some
very
important
changes
in
our
housing
programs
if
we
are
to
pursue
these
same
basic
goals
so
a
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
will
be
needed
to
spearhead
this
effort
in
our
cities
every
citizen
has
the
right
to
feel
secure
in
his
home
and
on
the
streets
of
his
community
to
help
control
crime
we
will
recommend
programs
to
train
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
put
the
best
techniques
of
modern
science
at
their
disposal
to
discover
the
causes
of
crime
and
better
ways
to
prevent
it
i
will
soon
assemble
a
panel
of
outstanding
experts
of
this
nation
to
search
out
answers
to
the
national
problem
of
crime
and
delinquency
and
i
welcome
the
recommendations
and
the
constructive
efforts
of
the
congress
the
beauty
of
america
for
over
three
centuries
the
beauty
of
america
has
sustained
our
spirit
and
has
enlarged
our
vision
we
must
act
now
to
protect
this
heritage
in
a
fruitful
new
partnership
with
the
states
and
the
cities
the
next
decade
should
be
a
conservation
milestone
we
must
make
a
massive
effort
to
save
the
countryside
and
to
establishas
a
green
legacy
for
tomorrowmore
large
and
small
parks
more
seashores
and
open
spaces
than
have
been
created
during
any
other
period
in
our
national
history
a
new
and
substantial
effort
must
be
made
to
landscape
highways
to
pro
vide
places
of
relaxation
and
recreation
wherever
our
roads
run
within
our
cities
imaginative
programs
are
needed
to
landscape
streets
and
to
transform
open
areas
into
places
of
beauty
and
recreation
we
will
seek
legal
power
to
prevent
pollution
of
our
air
and
water
before
it
happens
we
will
step
up
our
effort
to
control
harmful
wastes
giving
first
priority
to
the
cleanup
of
our
most
contaminated
rivers
we
will
increase
research
to
learn
much
more
about
the
control
of
pollution
we
hope
to
make
the
potomac
a
model
of
beauty
here
in
the
capital
and
preserve
unspoiled
stretches
of
some
of
our
waterways
with
a
wild
rivers
bill
more
ideas
for
a
beautiful
america
will
emerge
from
a
white
house
conference
on
natural
beauty
which
i
will
soon
call
art
and
science
we
must
also
recognize
and
encourage
those
who
can
be
pathfinders
for
the
nations
imagination
and
understanding
to
help
promote
and
honor
creative
achievements
i
will
propose
a
national
foundation
on
the
arts
to
develop
knowledge
which
will
enrich
our
lives
and
ensure
our
progress
i
will
recommend
programs
to
encourage
basic
science
particularly
in
the
universitiesand
to
bring
closer
the
day
when
the
oceans
will
supply
our
growing
need
for
fresh
water
for
government
to
serve
these
goals
it
must
be
modern
in
structure
efficient
in
action
and
ready
for
any
emergency
i
am
busy
currently
reviewing
the
structure
of
the
entire
executive
branch
of
this
government
i
hope
to
reshape
it
and
to
reorganize
it
to
meet
more
effectively
the
tasks
of
the
th
century
wherever
waste
is
found
i
will
eliminate
it
last
year
we
saved
almost
million
by
eliminating
waste
in
the
national
government
and
i
intend
to
do
better
this
year
and
very
soon
i
will
report
to
you
on
our
progress
and
on
new
economies
that
your
government
plans
to
make
even
the
best
of
government
is
subject
to
the
worst
of
hazards
i
will
propose
laws
to
insure
the
necessary
continuity
of
leadership
should
the
president
become
disabled
or
die
in
addition
i
will
propose
reforms
in
the
electoral
collegeleaving
undisturbed
the
vote
by
statesbut
making
sure
that
no
elector
can
substitute
his
will
for
that
of
the
people
last
year
in
a
sad
moment
i
came
here
and
i
spoke
to
you
after
years
of
public
service
practically
all
of
them
here
on
this
hill
this
year
i
speak
after
year
as
president
of
the
united
states
many
of
you
in
this
chamber
are
among
my
oldest
friends
we
have
shared
many
happy
moments
and
many
hours
of
work
and
we
have
watched
many
presidents
together
yet
only
in
the
white
house
can
you
finally
know
the
full
weight
of
this
office
the
greatest
burden
is
not
running
the
huge
operations
of
governmentor
meeting
daily
troubles
large
and
smallor
even
working
with
the
congress
a
presidents
hardest
task
is
not
to
do
what
is
right
but
to
know
what
is
right
yet
the
presidency
brings
no
special
gift
of
prophecy
or
foresight
you
take
an
oath
you
step
into
an
office
and
you
must
then
help
guide
a
great
democracy
the
answer
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
land
where
i
was
born
it
was
once
barren
land
the
angular
hills
were
covered
with
scrub
cedar
and
a
few
large
live
oaks
little
would
grow
in
that
harsh
caliche
soil
of
my
country
and
each
spring
the
pedernales
river
would
flood
our
valley
but
men
came
and
they
worked
and
they
endured
and
they
built
and
tonight
that
country
is
abundant
abundant
with
fruit
and
cattle
and
goats
and
sheep
and
there
are
pleasant
homes
and
lakes
and
the
floods
are
gone
why
did
men
come
to
that
once
forbidding
land
well
they
were
restless
of
course
and
they
had
to
be
moving
on
but
there
was
more
than
that
there
was
a
dreama
dream
of
a
place
where
a
free
man
could
build
for
himself
and
raise
his
children
to
a
better
lifea
dream
of
a
continent
to
be
conquered
a
world
to
be
won
a
nation
to
be
made
remembering
this
i
knew
the
answer
a
president
does
not
shape
a
new
and
personal
vision
of
america
he
collects
it
from
the
scattered
hopes
of
the
american
past
it
existed
when
the
first
settlers
saw
the
coast
of
a
new
world
and
when
the
first
pioneers
moved
westward
it
has
guided
us
every
step
of
the
way
it
sustains
every
president
but
it
is
also
your
inheritance
and
it
belongs
equally
to
all
the
people
that
we
all
serve
it
must
be
interpreted
anew
by
each
generation
for
its
own
needs
as
i
have
tried
in
part
to
do
tonight
it
shall
lead
us
as
we
enter
the
third
century
of
the
search
for
a
more
perfect
union
this
then
is
the
state
of
the
union
free
and
restless
growing
and
full
of
hope
so
it
was
in
the
beginning
so
it
shall
always
be
while
god
is
willing
and
we
are
strong
enough
to
keep
the
faith

mr
speaker
mr
president
members
of
the
house
and
senate
my
fellow
americans
i
will
be
brief
for
our
time
is
necessarily
short
and
our
agenda
is
already
long
last
years
congressional
session
was
the
longest
in
peacetime
history
with
that
foundation
let
us
work
together
to
make
this
years
session
the
best
in
the
nations
history
let
this
session
of
congress
be
known
as
the
session
which
did
more
for
civil
rights
than
the
last
hundred
sessions
combined
as
the
session
which
enacted
the
most
farreaching
tax
cut
of
our
time
as
the
session
which
declared
allout
war
on
human
poverty
and
unemployment
in
these
united
states
as
the
session
which
finally
recognized
the
health
needs
of
all
our
older
citizens
as
the
session
which
reformed
our
tangled
transportation
and
transit
policies
as
the
session
which
achieved
the
most
effective
efficient
foreign
aid
program
ever
and
as
the
session
which
helped
to
build
more
homes
more
schools
more
libraries
and
more
hospitals
than
any
single
session
of
congress
in
the
history
of
our
republic
all
this
and
more
can
and
must
be
done
it
can
be
done
by
this
summer
and
it
can
be
done
without
any
increase
in
spending
in
fact
under
the
budget
that
i
shall
shortly
submit
it
can
be
done
with
an
actual
reduction
in
federal
expenditures
and
federal
employment
we
have
in
a
unique
opportunity
and
obligationto
prove
the
success
of
our
system
to
disprove
those
cynics
and
critics
at
home
and
abroad
who
question
our
purpose
and
our
competence
if
we
fail
if
we
fritter
and
fumble
away
our
opportunity
in
needless
senseless
quarrels
between
democrats
and
republicans
or
between
the
house
and
the
senate
or
between
the
south
and
north
or
between
the
congress
and
the
administration
then
history
will
rightfully
judge
us
harshly
but
if
we
succeed
if
we
can
achieve
these
goals
by
forging
in
this
country
a
greater
sense
of
union
then
and
only
then
can
we
take
full
satisfaction
in
the
state
of
the
union
ii
here
in
the
congress
you
can
demonstrate
effective
legislative
leadership
by
discharging
the
public
business
with
clarity
and
dispatch
voting
each
important
proposal
up
or
voting
it
down
but
at
least
bringing
it
to
a
fair
and
a
final
vote
let
us
carry
forward
the
plans
and
programs
of
john
fitzgerald
kennedynot
because
of
our
sorrow
or
sympathy
but
because
they
are
right
in
his
memory
today
i
especially
ask
all
members
of
my
own
political
faith
in
this
election
year
to
put
your
country
ahead
of
your
party
and
to
always
debate
principles
never
debate
personalities
for
my
part
i
pledge
a
progressive
administration
which
is
efficient
and
honest
and
frugal
the
budget
to
be
submitted
to
the
congress
shortly
is
in
full
accord
with
this
pledge
it
will
cut
our
deficit
in
halffrom
billion
to
million
it
will
be
in
proportion
to
our
national
output
the
smallest
budget
since
it
will
call
for
a
substantial
reduction
in
federal
employment
a
feat
accomplished
only
once
before
in
the
last
years
while
maintaining
the
full
strength
of
our
combat
defenses
it
will
call
for
the
lowest
number
of
civilian
personnel
in
the
department
of
defense
since
it
will
call
for
total
expenditures
of
millioncompared
to
million
for
the
current
year
a
reduction
of
more
than
million
it
will
call
for
new
obligational
authority
of
milliona
reduction
of
more
than
billion
below
last
years
request
of
million
but
it
is
not
a
standstill
budget
for
america
cannot
afford
to
stand
still
our
population
is
growing
our
economy
is
more
complex
our
peoples
needs
are
expanding
but
by
closing
down
obsolete
installations
by
curtailing
less
urgent
programs
by
cutting
back
where
cutting
back
seems
to
be
wise
by
insisting
on
a
dollars
worth
for
a
dollar
spent
i
am
able
to
recommend
in
this
reduced
budget
the
most
federal
support
in
history
for
education
for
health
for
retraining
the
unemployed
and
for
helping
the
economically
and
the
physically
handicapped
this
budget
and
this
years
legislative
program
are
designed
to
help
each
and
every
american
citizen
fulfill
his
basic
hopeshis
hopes
for
a
fair
chance
to
make
good
his
hopes
for
fair
play
from
the
law
his
hopes
for
a
fulltime
job
on
fulltime
pay
his
hopes
for
a
decent
home
for
his
family
in
a
decent
community
his
hopes
for
a
good
school
for
his
children
with
good
teachers
and
his
hopes
for
security
when
faced
with
sickness
or
unemployment
or
old
age
iii
unfortunately
many
americans
live
on
the
outskirts
of
hopesome
because
of
their
poverty
and
some
because
of
theft
color
and
all
too
many
because
of
both
our
task
is
to
help
replace
their
despair
with
opportunity
this
administration
today
here
and
now
declares
unconditional
war
on
poverty
in
america
i
urge
this
congress
and
all
americans
to
join
with
me
in
that
effort
it
will
not
be
a
short
or
easy
struggle
no
single
weapon
or
strategy
will
suffice
but
we
shall
not
rest
until
that
war
is
won
the
richest
nation
on
earth
can
afford
to
win
it
we
cannot
afford
to
lose
it
one
thousand
dollars
invested
in
salvaging
an
unemployable
youth
today
can
return
or
more
in
his
lifetime
poverty
is
a
national
problem
requiring
improved
national
organization
and
support
but
this
attack
to
be
effective
must
also
be
organized
at
the
state
and
the
local
level
and
must
be
supported
and
directed
by
state
and
local
efforts
for
the
war
against
poverty
will
not
be
won
here
in
washington
it
must
be
won
in
the
field
in
every
private
home
in
every
public
office
from
the
courthouse
to
the
white
house
the
program
i
shall
propose
will
emphasize
this
cooperative
approach
to
help
that
onefifth
of
all
american
families
with
incomes
too
small
to
even
meet
their
basic
needs
our
chief
weapons
in
a
more
pinpointed
attack
will
be
better
schools
and
better
health
and
better
homes
and
better
training
and
better
job
opportunities
to
help
more
americans
especially
young
americans
escape
from
squalor
and
misery
and
unemployment
rolls
where
other
citizens
help
to
carry
them
very
often
a
lack
of
jobs
and
money
is
not
the
cause
of
poverty
but
the
symptom
the
cause
may
lie
deeper
in
our
failure
to
give
our
fellow
citizens
a
fair
chance
to
develop
their
own
capacities
in
a
lack
of
education
and
training
in
a
lack
of
medical
care
and
housing
in
a
lack
of
decent
communities
in
which
to
live
and
bring
up
their
children
but
whatever
the
cause
our
joint
federallocal
effort
must
pursue
poverty
pursue
it
wherever
it
existsin
city
slums
and
small
towns
in
sharecropper
shacks
or
in
migrant
worker
camps
on
indian
reservations
among
whites
as
well
as
negroes
among
the
young
as
well
as
the
aged
in
the
boom
towns
and
in
the
depressed
areas
our
aim
is
not
only
to
relieve
the
symptom
of
poverty
but
to
cure
it
and
above
all
to
prevent
it
no
single
piece
of
legislation
however
is
going
to
suffice
we
will
launch
a
special
effort
in
the
chronically
distressed
areas
of
appalachia
we
must
expand
our
small
but
our
successful
area
redevelopment
program
we
must
enact
youth
employment
legislation
to
put
jobless
aimless
hopeless
youngsters
to
work
on
useful
projects
we
must
distribute
more
food
to
the
needy
through
a
broader
food
stamp
program
we
must
create
a
national
service
corps
to
help
the
economically
handicapped
of
our
own
country
as
the
peace
corps
now
helps
those
abroad
we
must
modernize
our
unemployment
insurance
and
establish
a
highlevel
commission
on
automation
if
we
have
the
brain
power
to
invent
these
machines
we
have
the
brain
power
to
make
certain
that
they
are
a
boon
and
not
a
bane
to
humanity
we
must
extend
the
coverage
of
our
minimum
wage
laws
to
more
than
million
workers
now
lacking
this
basic
protection
of
purchasing
power
we
must
by
including
special
school
aid
funds
as
part
of
our
education
program
improve
the
quality
of
teaching
training
and
counseling
in
our
hardest
hit
areas
we
must
build
more
libraries
in
every
area
and
more
hospitals
and
nursing
homes
under
the
hillburton
act
and
train
more
nurses
to
staff
them
we
must
provide
hospital
insurance
for
our
older
citizens
financed
by
every
worker
and
his
employer
under
social
security
contributing
no
more
than
a
month
during
the
employees
working
career
to
protect
him
in
his
old
age
in
a
dignified
manner
without
cost
to
the
treasury
against
the
devastating
hardship
of
prolonged
or
repeated
illness
we
must
as
a
part
of
a
revised
housing
and
urban
renewal
program
give
more
help
to
those
displaced
by
slum
clearance
provide
more
housing
for
our
poor
and
our
elderly
and
seek
as
our
ultimate
goal
in
our
free
enterprise
system
a
decent
home
for
every
american
family
we
must
help
obtain
more
modern
mass
transit
within
our
communities
as
well
as
lowcost
transportation
between
them
above
all
we
must
release
billion
of
tax
reduction
into
the
private
spending
stream
to
create
new
jobs
and
new
markets
in
every
area
of
this
land
iv
these
programs
are
obviously
not
for
the
poor
or
the
underprivileged
alone
every
american
will
benefit
by
the
extension
of
social
security
to
cover
the
hospital
costs
of
their
aged
parents
every
american
community
will
benefit
from
the
construction
or
modernization
of
schools
libraries
hospitals
and
nursing
homes
from
the
training
of
more
nurses
and
from
the
improvement
of
urban
renewal
in
public
transit
and
every
individual
american
taxpayer
and
every
corporate
taxpayer
will
benefit
from
the
earliest
possible
passage
of
the
pending
tax
bill
from
both
the
new
investment
it
will
bring
and
the
new
jobs
that
it
will
create
that
tax
bill
has
been
thoroughly
discussed
for
a
year
now
we
need
action
the
new
budget
clearly
allows
it
our
taxpayers
surely
deserve
it
our
economy
strongly
demands
it
and
every
month
of
delay
dilutes
its
benefits
in
for
consumption
for
investment
and
for
employment
for
until
the
bill
is
signed
its
investment
incentives
cannot
be
deemed
certain
and
the
withholding
rate
cannot
be
reducedand
the
most
damaging
and
devastating
thing
you
can
do
to
any
businessman
in
america
is
to
keep
him
in
doubt
and
to
keep
him
guessing
on
what
our
tax
policy
is
and
i
say
that
we
should
now
reduce
to
percent
instead
of
percent
our
withholding
rate
i
therefore

urge
the
congress
to
take
final
action
on
this
bill
by
the
first
of
february
if
at
all
possible
for
however
proud
we
may
be
of
the
unprecedented
progress
of
our
free
enterprise
economy
over
the
last
years
we
should
not
and
we
cannot
permit
it
to
pause
in
for
the
first
time
in
history
we
crossed
the
million
job
mark
but
we
will
soon
need
more
than
million
jobs
in
our
gross
national
product
reached
the
billion
level
billion
higher
than
when
we
took
office
but
it
easily
could
and
it
should
be
still
billion
higher
today
than
it
is
wages
and
profits
and
family
income
are
also
at
their
highest
levels
in
historybut
i
would
remind
you
that
million
workers
and
percent
of
our
industrial
capacity
are
still
idle
today
we
need
a
tax
cut
now
to
keep
this
country
moving
v
for
our
goal
is
not
merely
to
spread
the
work
our
goal
is
to
create
more
jobs
i
believe
the
enactment
of
a
hour
week
would
sharply
increase
costs
would
invite
inflation
would
impair
our
ability
to
compete
and
merely
share
instead
of
creating
employment
but
i
am
equally
opposed
to
the
or
hour
week
in
those
industries
where
consistently
excessive
use
of
overtime
causes
increased
unemployment
so
therefore
i
recommend
legislation
authorizing
the
creation
of
a
tripartite
industry
committee
to
determine
on
an
industrybyindustry
basis
as
to
where
a
higher
penalty
rate
for
overtime
would
increase
job
openings
without
unduly
increasing
costs
and
authorizing
the
establishment
of
such
higher
rates
vi
let
me
make
one
principle
of
this
administration
abundantly
clear
all
of
these
increased
opportunitiesin
employment
in
education
in
housing
and
in
every
fieldmust
be
open
to
americans
of
every
color
as
far
as
the
writ
of
federal
law
will
run
we
must
abolish
not
some
but
all
racial
discrimination
for
this
is
not
merely
an
economic
issue
or
a
social
political
or
international
issue
it
is
a
moral
issue
and
it
must
be
met
by
the
passage
this
session
of
the
bill
now
pending
in
the
house
all
members
of
the
public
should
have
equal
access
to
facilities
open
to
the
public
all
members
of
the
public
should
be
equally
eligible
for
federal
benefits
that
are
financed
by
the
public
all
members
of
the
public
should
have
an
equal
chance
to
vote
for
public
officials
and
to
send
their
children
to
good
public
schools
and
to
contribute
their
talents
to
the
public
good
today
americans
of
all
races
stand
side
by
side
in
berlin
and
in
viet
nam
they
died
side
by
side
in
korea
surely
they
can
work
and
eat
and
travel
side
by
side
in
their
own
country
vii
we
must
also
lift
by
legislation
the
bars
of
discrimination
against
those
who
seek
entry
into
our
country
particularly
those
who
have
much
needed
skills
and
those
joining
their
families
in
establishing
preferences
a
nation
that
was
built
by
the
immigrants
of
all
lands
can
ask
those
who
now
seek
admission
what
can
you
do
for
our
country
but
we
should
not
be
asking
in
what
country
were
you
born
viii
for
our
ultimate
goal
is
a
world
without
war
a
world
made
safe
for
diversity
in
which
all
men
goods
and
ideas
can
freely
move
across
every
border
and
every
boundary
we
must
advance
toward
this
goal
in
in
at
least
different
ways
not
as
partisans
but
as
patriots
first
we
must
maintainand
our
reduced
defense
budget
will
maintainthat
margin
of
military
safety
and
superiority
obtained
through
years
of
steadily
increasing
both
the
quality
and
the
quantity
of
our
strategic
our
conventional
and
our
antiguerilla
forces
in
we
will
be
better
prepared
than
ever
before
to
defend
the
cause
of
freedom
whether
it
is
threatened
by
outright
aggression
or
by
the
infiltration
practiced
by
those
in
hanoi
and
havana
who
ship
arms
and
men
across
international
borders
to
foment
insurrection
and
we
must
continue
to
use
that
strength
as
john
kennedy
used
it
in
the
cuban
crisis
and
for
the
test
ban
treatyto
demonstrate
both
the
futility
of
nuclear
war
and
the
possibilities
of
lasting
peace
second
we
must
take
new
stepsand
we
shall
make
new
proposals
at
genevatoward
the
control
and
the
eventual
abolition
of
arms
even
in
the
absence
of
agreement
we
must
not
stockpile
arms
beyond
our
needs
or
seek
an
excess
of
military
power
that
could
be
provocative
as
well
as
wasteful
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
in
this
fiscal
year
we
are
cutting
back
our
production
of
enriched
uranium
by
percent
we
are
shutting
down
four
plutonium
piles
we
are
closing
many
nonessential
military
installations
and
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
we
today
call
on
our
adversaries
to
do
the
same
third
we
must
make
increased
use
of
our
food
as
an
instrument
of
peacemaking
it
available
by
sale
or
trade
or
loan
or
donationto
hungry
people
in
all
nations
which
tell
us
of
their
needs
and
accept
proper
conditions
of
distribution
fourth
we
must
assure
our
preeminence
in
the
peaceful
exploration
of
outer
space
focusing
on
an
expedition
to
the
moon
in
this
decadein
cooperation
with
other
powers
if
possible
alone
if
necessary
fifth
we
must
expand
world
trade
having
recognized
in
the
act
of
that
we
must
buy
as
well
as
sell
we
now
expect
our
trading
partners
to
recognize
that
we
must
sell
as
well
as
buy
we
are
willing
to
give
them
competitive
access
to
our
market
asking
only
that
they
do
the
same
for
us
sixth
we
must
continue
through
such
measures
as
the
interest
equalization
tax
as
well
as
the
cooperation
of
other
nations
our
recent
progress
toward
balancing
our
international
accounts
this
administration
must
and
will
preserve
the
present
gold
value
of
the
dollar
seventh
we
must
become
better
neighbors
with
the
free
states
of
the
americas
working
with
the
councils
of
the
oas
with
a
stronger
alliance
for
progress
and
with
all
the
men
and
women
of
this
hemisphere
who
really
believe
in
liberty
and
justice
for
all
eighth
we
must
strengthen
the
ability
of
free
nations
everywhere
to
develop
their
independence
and
raise
their
standard
of
living
and
thereby
frustrate
those
who
prey
on
poverty
and
chaos
to
do
this
the
rich
must
help
the
poorand
we
must
do
our
part
we
must
achieve
a
more
rigorous
administration
of
our
development
assistance
with
larger
roles
for
private
investors
for
other
industrialized
nations
and
for
international
agencies
and
for
the
recipient
nations
themselves
ninth
we
must
strengthen
our
atlantic
and
pacific
partnerships
maintain
our
alliances
and
make
the
united
nations
a
more
effective
instrument
for
national
independence
and
international
order
tenth
and
finally
we
must
develop
with
our
allies
new
means
of
bridging
the
gap
between
the
east
and
the
west
facing
danger
boldly
wherever
danger
exists
but
being
equally
bold
in
our
search
for
new
agreements
which
can
enlarge
the
hopes
of
all
while
violating
the
interests
of
none
in
short
i
would
say
to
the
congress
that
we
must
be
constantly
prepared
for
the
worst
and
constantly
acting
for
the
best
we
must
be
strong
enough
to
win
any
war
and
we
must
be
wise
enough
to
prevent
one
we
shall
neither
act
as
aggressors
nor
tolerate
acts
of
aggression
we
intend
to
bury
no
one
and
we
do
not
intend
to
be
buried
we
can
fight
if
we
must
as
we
have
fought
before
but
we
pray
that
we
will
never
have
to
fight
again
ix
my
good
friends
and
my
fellow
americans
in
these
last
sorrowful
weeks
we
have
learned
anew
that
nothing
is
so
enduring
as
faith
and
nothing
is
so
degrading
as
hate
john
kennedy
was
a
victim
of
hate
but
he
was
also
a
great
builder
of
faithfaith
in
our
fellow
americans
whatever
their
creed
or
their
color
or
their
station
in
life
faith
in
the
future
of
man
whatever
his
divisions
and
differences
this
faith
was
echoed
in
all
parts
of
the
world
on
every
continent
and
in
every
land
to
which
mrs
johnson
and
i
traveled
we
found
faith
and
hope
and
love
toward
this
land
of
america
and
toward
our
people
so
i
ask
you
now
in
the
congress
and
in
the
country
to
join
with
me
in
expressing
and
fulfilling
that
faith
in
working
for
a
nation
a
nation
that
is
free
from
want
and
a
world
that
is
free
from
hatea
world
of
peace
and
justice
and
freedom
and
abundance
for
our
time
and
for
all
time
to
come

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
i
have
the
honor
to
report
to
the
congress
on
the
state
of
the
union
this
is
the
eighth
such
report
that
as
president
i
have
been
privileged
to
present
to
you
and
to
the
country
on
previous
occasions
it
has
been
my
custom
to
set
forth
proposals
for
legislative
action
in
the
coming
year
but
that
is
not
my
purpose
today
the
presentation
of
a
legislative
program
falls
properly
to
my
successor
not
to
me
and
i
would
not
infringe
upon
his
responsibility
to
chart
the
forward
course
instead
i
wish
to
speak
of
the
course
we
have
been
following
the
past
eight
years
and
the
position
at
which
we
have
arrived
in
just
two
weeks
general
eisenhower
will
be
inaugurated
as
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
will
resumemost
gladlymy
place
as
a
private
citizen
of
this
republic
the
presidency
last
changed
hands
eight
years
ago
this
coming
april
that
was
a
tragic
time
a
time
of
grieving
for
president
rooseveltthe
great
and
gallant
human
being
who
had
been
taken
from
us
a
time
of
unrelieved
anxiety
to
his
successor
thrust
so
suddenly
into
the
complexities
and
burdens
of
the
presidential
office
not
so
this
time
this
time
we
see
the
normal
transition
under
our
democratic
system
one
president
at
the
conclusion
of
his
term
steps
back
to
private
life
his
successor
chosen
by
the
people
begins
his
tenure
of
the
office
and
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
continues
to
function
without
a
moments
break
since
the
election
i
have
done
my
best
to
assure
that
the
transfer
from
one
administration
to
another
shall
be
smooth
and
orderly
from
general
eisenhower
and
his
associates
i
have
had
friendly
and
understanding
collaboration
in
this
endeavor
i
have
not
sought
to
thrust
upon
himnor
has
he
sought
to
takethe
responsibility
which
must
be
mine
until
twelve
oclock
noon
on
january
twentieth
but
together
i
hope
and
believe
we
have
found
means
whereby
the
incoming
president
can
obtain
the
full
and
detailed
information
he
will
need
to
assume
the
responsibility
the
moment
he
takes
the
oath
of
office
the
presidentelect
is
about
to
take
up
the
greatest
burdens
the
most
compelling
responsibilities
given
to
any
man
and
i
with
you
and
all
americans
wish
for
him
all
possible
success
in
undertaking
the
tasks
that
will
so
soon
be
his
what
are
these
tasks
the
president
is
chief
of
state
elected
representative
of
all
the
people
national
spokesman
for
them
and
to
them
he
is
commanderinchief
of
our
armed
forces
he
is
charged
with
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
relations
he
is
chief
executive
of
the
nations
largest
civilian
organization
he
must
select
and
nominate
all
top
officials
of
the
executive
branch
and
all
federal
judges
and
on
the
legislative
side
he
has
the
obligation
and
the
opportunity
to
recommend
and
to
approve
or
veto
legislation
besides
all
this
it
is
to
him
that
a
great
political
party
turns
naturally
for
leadership
and
that
too
he
must
provide
as
president
this
bundle
of
burdens
is
unique
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
on
the
face
of
the
earth
each
task
could
be
a
fulltime
job
together
they
would
be
a
tremendous
undertaking
in
the
easiest
of
times
but
our
times
are
not
easy
they
are
hardas
hard
and
complex
perhaps
as
any
in
our
history
now
the
president
not
only
has
to
carry
on
these
tasks
in
such
a
way
that
our
democracy
may
grow
and
flourish
and
our
people
prosper
but
he
also
has
to
lead
the
whole
free
world
in
overcoming
the
communist
menaceand
all
this
under
the
shadow
of
the
atomic
bomb
this
is
a
huge
challenge
to
the
human
being
who
occupies
the
presidential
office
but
it
is
not
a
challenge
to
him
alone
for
in
reality
he
cannot
meet
it
alone
the
challenge
runs
not
just
to
him
but
to
his
whole
administration
to
the
congress
to
the
country
ultimately
no
president
can
master
his
responsibilities
save
as
his
fellow
citizensindeed
the
whole
peoplecomprehend
the
challenge
of
our
times
and
move
with
him
to
meet
it
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
hold
the
presidential
office
for
nearly
eight
years
now
and
much
has
been
done
in
which
i
take
great
pride
but
this
is
not
personal
pride
it
is
pride
in
the
people
in
the
nation
it
is
pride
in
our
political
system
and
our
form
of
governmentbalky
sometimes
mechanically
deficient
perhaps
in
many
waysbut
enormously
alive
and
vigorous
able
through
these
years
to
keep
the
republic
on
the
right
course
rising
to
the
great
occasions
accomplishing
the
essentials
meeting
the
basic
challenge
of
our
times
there
have
been
misunderstandings
and
controversies
these
past
eight
years
but
through
it
all
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
had
that
measure
of
support
and
understanding
without
which
no
man
could
sustain
the
burdens
of
the
presidential
office
or
hope
to
discharge
its
responsibilities
for
this
i
am
profoundly
gratefulgrateful
to
my
associates
in
the
executive
branchmost
of
them
nonpartisan
civil
servants
gratefuldespite
our
disagreementsto
the
members
of
the
congress
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
grateful
especially
to
the
american
people
the
citizens
of
this
republic
governors
of
us
all
we
are
still
so
close
to
recent
controversies
that
some
of
us
may
find
it
hard
to
understand
the
accomplishments
of
these
past
eight
years
but
the
accomplishments
are
real
and
very
great
not
as
the
presidents
not
as
the
congress
but
as
the
achievements
of
our
country
and
all
the
people
in
it
let
me
remind
you
of
some
of
the
things
we
have
done
since
i
first
assumed
my
duties
as
president
of
the
united
states
i
took
the
oath
of
office
on
april
in
may
of
that
same
year
the
nazis
surrendered
then
in
july
that
great
white
flash
of
light
manmade
at
alamogordo
heralded
swift
and
final
victory
in
world
war
iiand
opened
the
doorway
to
the
atomic
age
consider
some
of
the
great
questions
that
were
posed
for
us
by
sudden
total
victory
in
world
war
ii
consider
also
how
well
we
as
a
nation
have
responded
would
the
american
economy
collapse
after
the
war
that
was
one
question
would
there
be
another
depression
herea
repetition
of
or
the
free
world
feared
and
dreaded
it
the
communists
hoped
for
it
and
built
their
policies
upon
that
hope
we
answered
that
questionanswered
it
with
a
resounding
no
our
economy
has
grown
tremendously
free
enterprise
has
flourished
as
never
fore
sixtytwo
million
people
are
now
gainfully
employed
compared
with
million
seven
years
ago
private
businessmen
and
farmers
have
invested
more
than
billion
dollars
in
new
plant
and
equipment
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
prices
have
risen
further
than
they
should
have
donebut
incomes
by
and
large
have
risen
even
more
so
that
real
living
standards
are
now
considerably
higher
than
seven
years
ago
aided
by
sound
government
policies
our
expanding
economy
has
shown
the
strength
and
flexibility
for
swift
and
almost
painless
reconversion
from
war
to
peace
in
and
for
quick
reaction
and
recoverywell
before
koreafrom
the
beginnings
of
recession
in
above
all
this
live
and
vital
economy
of
ours
has
now
shown
the
remarkable
capacity
to
sustain
a
great
mobilization
program
for
defense
a
vast
outpouring
of
aid
to
friends
and
allies
all
around
the
worldand
still
to
produce
more
goods
and
services
for
peaceful
use
at
home
than
we
have
ever
known
before
this
has
been
our
answer
up
to
now
to
those
who
feared
or
hoped
for
a
depression
in
this
country
how
have
we
handled
our
national
finances
that
was
another
question
arising
at
wars
end
in
the
administration
of
the
government
no
problem
takes
more
of
the
presidents
time
year
in
and
year
out
than
fashioning
the
budget
and
the
related
problem
of
managing
the
public
debt
financing
world
war
ii
left
us
with
a
tremendous
public
debt
which
reached
billion
dollars
at
its
peak
in
february
beginning
in
july
when
war
and
reconversion
financing
had
ended
we
have
held
quite
closely
to
the
sound
standard
that
in
times
of
high
employment
and
high
national
income
the
federal
budget
should
be
balanced
and
the
debt
reduced
for
the
four
fiscal
years
from
july
to
june
we
had
a
net
surplus
of
billion
dollars
using
this
surplus
and
the
treasurys
excess
cash
reserves
the
debt
was
reduced
substantially
reaching
a
low
point
of
billion
dollars
in
june
and
ending
up
at
billion
dollars
on
june
in
july
of
we
began
our
rapid
rearmament
and
for
two
years
held
very
close
to
a
payaswego
policy
but
in
the
current
fiscal
year
and
the
next
rising
expenditures
for
defense
will
substantially
outrun
receipts
this
will
pose
an
immediate
and
serious
problem
for
the
new
congress
now
let
me
turn
to
another
question
we
faced
at
the
wars
end
would
we
take
up
again
and
carry
forward
the
great
projects
of
social
welfareso
badly
needed
so
long
overduethat
the
new
deal
had
introduced
into
our
national
life
would
our
government
continue
to
have
a
heart
for
the
people
or
was
the
progress
of
the
new
deal
to
be
halted
in
the
aftermath
of
war
as
decisively
as
the
progress
of
woodrow
wilsons
new
freedom
had
been
halted
after
the
first
world
war
this
question
too
we
have
answered
we
have
answered
it
by
doubling
old
age
insurance
benefits
and
extending
coverage
to
ten
million
more
people
we
have
answered
it
by
increasing
our
minimum
wage
we
have
answered
by
the
three
million
privately
constructed
homes
that
the
federal
government
has
helped
finance
since
the
warand
the
thousand
units
of
low
rent
public
housing
placed
under
construction
since
we
have
answered
with
the
thousand
new
hospital
beds
provided
since
through
the
joint
efforts
of
the
federal
government
and
local
communities
we
have
answered
by
helping
eight
million
veterans
of
world
war
ii
to
obtain
advanced
education
thousand
to
start
in
business
and
thousand
to
buy
farms
we
have
answered
by
continuing
to
help
farmers
obtain
electric
power
until
today
nearly
per
cent
of
our
farms
have
power
line
electric
service
in
these
and
other
ways
we
have
demonstrated
up
to
now
that
our
democracy
has
not
forgotten
how
to
use
the
powers
of
the
government
to
promote
the
peoples
welfare
and
security
another
of
the
big
postwar
questions
was
this
what
we
would
do
with
the
nations
natural
resourcesits
soils
and
water
forests
and
gras
slands
would
we
continue
the
strong
conservation
movement
of
the
s
or
would
we
as
we
did
after
the
first
world
war
slip
back
into
the
practices
of
monopoly
exploitation
and
waste
the
answer
is
plain
all
across
our
country
the
soil
conservation
movement
has
spread
aided
by
government
programs
enriching
private
and
public
lands
preserving
them
from
destruction
improving
them
for
future
use
in
our
river
basins
we
have
invested
nearly
billion
dollars
of
public
funds
in
the
last
eight
yearsinvested
them
in
projects
to
control
floods
irrigate
farmlands
produce
lowcost
power
and
get
it
to
the
housewives
and
farmers
and
businessmen
who
need
it
we
have
been
vigilant
in
protecting
the
peoples
propertylands
and
forests
and
oil
and
minerals
we
have
had
to
fight
hard
against
those
who
would
use
our
resources
for
private
greed
we
have
met
setbacks
we
have
had
to
delay
work
because
of
defense
priorities
but
on
the
whole
we
can
be
proud
of
our
record
in
protecting
our
natural
heritage
and
in
using
our
resources
for
the
public
good
here
is
another
question
we
had
to
face
at
the
wars
close
would
we
continue
in
peace
as
well
as
war
to
promote
equality
of
opportunity
for
all
our
citizens
seeking
ways
and
means
to
guarantee
for
all
of
them
the
full
enjoyment
of
their
civil
rights
during
the
war
we
achieved
great
economic
and
social
gains
for
millions
of
our
fellow
citizens
who
had
been
held
back
by
prejudice
were
we
prepared
in
peacetime
to
keep
on
moving
toward
full
realization
of
the
democratic
promise
or
would
we
let
it
be
submerged
wiped
out
in
postwar
riots
and
reaction
as
after
world
war
i
we
answered
these
questions
in
a
series
of
forward
steps
at
every
level
of
government
and
in
many
spheres
of
private
life
in
our
armed
forces
our
civil
service
our
universities
our
railway
trains
the
residential
districts
of
our
citiesin
stores
and
factories
all
across
the
nationin
the
polling
booths
as
wellthe
barriers
are
coming
down
this
is
happening
in
part
at
the
mandate
of
the
courts
in
part
at
the
insistence
of
federal
state
and
local
governments
in
part
through
the
enlightened
action
of
private
groups
and
persons
in
every
region
and
every
walk
of
life
there
has
been
a
great
awakening
of
the
american
conscience
on
the
issues
of
civil
rights
and
all
this
progressstill
far
from
complete
but
still
continuinghas
been
our
answer
up
to
now
to
those
who
questioned
our
intention
to
live
up
to
the
promises
of
equal
freedom
for
us
all
there
was
another
question
posed
for
us
at
the
wars
end
which
equally
concerned
the
future
course
of
our
democracy
could
the
machinery
of
government
and
politics
in
this
republic
be
changed
improved
adapted
rapidly
enough
to
carry
through
responsibly
and
well
the
vast
new
complicated
undertakings
called
for
in
our
time
we
have
answered
this
question
too
answered
it
by
tackling
the
most
urgent
most
specific
problems
which
the
war
experience
itself
had
brought
into
sharp
focus
the
reorganization
of
the
congress
in
the
unification
of
our
armed
services
beginning
in
the
closer
integration
of
foreign
and
military
policy
through
the
national
security
council
created
that
same
year
and
the
executive
reorganizations
before
and
after
the
hooveracheson
commission
report
in
these
are
landmarks
in
our
continuing
endeavor
to
make
government
an
effective
instrument
of
service
to
the
people
i
come
now
to
the
most
vital
question
of
all
the
greatest
of
our
concerns
could
there
be
built
in
the
world
a
durable
structure
of
security
a
lasting
peace
for
all
the
nations
or
would
we
drift
as
after
world
war
i
toward
another
terrible
disastera
disaster
which
this
time
might
be
the
holocaust
of
atomic
war
that
is
still
the
overriding
question
of
our
time
we
cannot
know
the
answer
yet
perhaps
we
will
not
know
it
finally
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
day
and
night
these
past
eight
years
we
have
been
building
for
peace
searching
out
the
way
that
leads
most
surely
to
security
and
freedom
and
justice
in
the
world
for
us
and
all
mankind
this
above
all
else
has
been
the
task
of
our
republic
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
and
our
accomplishment
so
far
should
give
real
pride
to
all
americans
at
the
very
least
a
total
war
has
been
averted
each
day
up
to
this
hour
and
at
the
most
we
may
already
have
succeeded
in
establishing
conditions
which
can
keep
that
kind
of
war
from
happening
for
as
far
ahead
as
man
can
see
the
second
world
war
radically
changed
the
power
relationships
of
the
world
nations
once
great
were
left
shattered
and
weak
channels
of
communication
routes
of
trade
political
and
economic
ties
of
many
kinds
were
ripped
apart
and
in
this
changed
disrupted
chaotic
situation
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
emerged
as
the
two
strongest
powers
of
the
world
each
had
tremendous
human
and
natural
resources
actual
or
potential
on
a
scale
unmatched
by
any
other
nation
nothing
could
make
plainer
why
the
world
is
in
its
present
stateand
how
that
came
to
passthan
an
understanding
of
the
diametrically
opposite
principles
and
policies
of
these
two
great
powers
in
a
warruined
world
for
our
part
we
in
this
republic
wereand
arefree
men
heirs
of
the
american
revolution
dedicated
to
the
truths
of
our
declaration
of
independence
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
to
secure
these
rights
governments
are
instituted
among
men
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
our
postwar
objective
has
been
in
keeping
with
this
great
idea
the
united
states
has
sought
to
use
its
preeminent
position
of
power
to
help
other
nations
recover
from
the
damage
and
dislocation
of
the
war
we
held
out
a
helping
hand
to
enable
them
to
restore
their
national
lives
and
to
regain
their
positions
as
independent
selfsupporting
members
of
the
great
family
of
nations
this
help
was
given
without
any
attempt
on
our
part
to
dominate
or
control
any
nation
we
did
not
want
satellites
but
partners
the
soviet
union
however
took
exactly
the
opposite
course
its
rulers
saw
in
the
weakened
condition
of
the
world
not
an
obligation
to
assist
in
the
great
work
of
reconstruction
but
an
opportunity
to
exploit
misery
and
suffering
for
the
extension
of
their
power
instead
of
help
they
brought
subjugation
they
extinguished
blotted
out
the
national
independence
of
the
countries
that
the
military
operations
of
world
war
ii
had
left
within
their
grasp
the
difference
stares
at
us
from
the
map
of
europe
today
to
the
west
of
the
line
that
tragically
divides
europe
we
see
nations
continuing
to
act
and
live
in
the
light
of
their
own
traditions
and
principles
on
the
other
side
we
see
the
dead
uniformity
of
a
tyrannical
system
imposed
by
the
rulers
of
the
soviet
union
nothing
could
point
up
more
clearly
what
the
global
struggle
between
the
free
world
and
the
communists
is
all
about
it
is
a
struggle
as
old
as
recorded
history
it
is
freedom
versus
tyranny
for
the
dominant
idea
of
the
soviet
regime
is
the
terrible
conception
that
men
do
not
have
rights
but
live
at
the
mercy
of
the
state
inevitably
this
idea
of
theirsand
all
the
consequences
flowing
from
itcollided
with
the
efforts
of
free
nations
to
build
a
just
and
peaceful
world
the
cold
war
between
the
communists
and
the
free
world
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
soviet
attempt
to
checkmate
and
defeat
our
peaceful
purposes
in
furtherance
of
their
own
dread
objective
we
did
not
seek
this
struggle
god
forbid
we
did
our
utmost
to
avoid
it
in
world
war
ii
we
and
the
russians
had
fought
side
by
side
each
in
our
turn
attacked
and
forced
to
combat
by
the
aggressors
after
the
war
we
hoped
that
our
wartime
collaboration
could
be
maintained
that
the
frightful
experience
of
nazi
invasion
of
devastation
in
the
heart
of
russia
had
turned
the
soviet
rulers
away
from
their
old
proclaimed
allegiance
to
world
revolution
and
communist
dominion
but
instead
they
violated
one
by
one
the
solemn
agreements
they
had
made
with
us
in
wartime
they
sought
to
use
the
rights
and
privileges
they
had
obtained
in
the
united
nations
to
frustrate
its
purposes
and
cut
down
its
powers
as
an
effective
agent
of
world
progress
and
the
keeper
of
the
worlds
peace
despite
this
outcome
the
efforts
we
made
toward
peaceful
collaboration
are
a
source
of
our
present
strength
they
demonstrated
that
we
believed
what
we
proclaimed
that
we
actually
sought
honest
agreements
as
the
way
to
peace
our
whole
moral
position
our
leadership
in
the
free
world
today
is
fortified
by
that
fact
the
world
is
divided
not
through
our
fault
or
failure
but
by
soviet
design
they
not
we
began
the
cold
war
and
because
the
free
world
saw
this
happen
because
men
know
we
made
the
effort
and
the
soviet
rulers
spurned
itthe
free
nations
have
accepted
leadership
from
our
republic
in
meeting
and
mastering
the
soviet
offensive
it
seems
to
me
especially
important
that
all
of
us
be
clear
in
our
own
thinking
about
the
nature
of
the
threat
we
have
facedand
will
face
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
measures
we
have
devised
to
meet
it
take
shape
and
pattern
only
as
we
understand
what
we
wereand
areup
against
the
soviet
union
occupies
a
territory
of
million
square
miles
beyond
its
borders

and
west
are
the
nearly
five
million
square
miles
of
the
satellite
statesvirtually
incorporated
into
the
soviet
unionand
of
china
now
its
close
partner
this
vast
land
mass
contains
an
enormous
store
of
natural
resources
sufficient
to
support
an
economic
development
comparable
to
our
own
that
is
the
stalinist
world
it
is
a
world
of
great
natural
diversity
in
geography
and
climate
in
distribution
of
resources
in
population
language
and
living
standards
in
economic
and
cultural
development
it
is
a
world
whose
people
are
not
all
convinced
communists
by
any
means
it
is
a
world
where
history
and
national
traditions
particularly
in
its
borderlands
tend
more
toward
separation
than
unification
and
run
counter
to
the
enforced
combination
that
has
been
made
of
these
areas
today
but
it
is
also
a
world
of
great
manmade
uniformities
a
world
that
bleeds
its
population
white
to
build
huge
mili
tary
forces
a
world
in
which
the
police
are
everywhere
and
their
authority
unlimited
a
world
where
terror
and
slavery
are
deliberately
administered
both
as
instruments
of
government
and
as
means
of
production
a
world
where
all
effective
social
power
is
the
states
monopolyyet
the
state
itself
is
the
creature
of
the
communist
tyrants
the
soviet
union
with
its
satellites
and
china
are
held
in
the
tight
grip
of
communist
party
chieftains
the
party
dominates
all
social
and
political
institutions
the
party
regulates
and
centrally
directs
the
whole
economy
in
moscows
sphere
and
in
peipings
all
history
philosophy
morality
and
law
are
centrally
established
by
rigid
dogmas
incessantly
drummed
into
the
whole
population
and
subject
to
interpretationor
to
change
by
none
except
the
partys
own
inner
circle
and
lest
their
people
learn
too
much
of
other
ways
of
life
the
communists
have
walled
off
their
world
deliberately
and
uniformly
from
the
rest
of
human
society
that
is
the
communist
base
of
operation
intheir
cold
war
in
addition
they
have
at
their
command
hundreds
and
thousands
of
dedicated
foreign
communists
people
in
nearly
every
free
country
who
will
serve
moscows
ends
thus
the
masters
of
the
kremlin
are
provided
with
deluded
followers
all
through
the
free
world
whom
they
can
manipulate
cynically
and
quite
ruthlessly
to
serve
the
purposes
of
the
soviet
state
given
their
vast
internal
base
of
operations
and
their
agents
in
foreign
lands
what
are
the
communist
rulers
trying
to
do
inside
their
homeland
the
communists
are
trying
to
maintain
and
modernize
huge
military
forces
and
simultaneously
they
are
endeavoring
to
weld
their
whole
vast
area
and
population
into
a
completely
selfcontained
advanced
industrial
society
they
aim
some
day
to
equal
or
better
the
production
levels
of
western
europe
and
north
america
combinedthus
shifting
the
balance
of
world
economic
power
and
war
potential
to
their
side
they
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
they
know
it
but
they
are
prepared
to
levy
upon
living
generations
any
sacrifice
that
helps
strengthen
their
armed
power
or
speed
industrial
development
externally
the
communist
rulers
are
trying
to
expand
the
boundaries
of
their
world
whenever
and
wherever
they
can
this
expansion
they
have
pursued
steadfastly
since
the
close
of
world
war
ii
using
any
means
available
to
them
where
the
soviet
army
was
present
as
in
the
countries
of
eastern
europe
they
have
gradually
squeezed
free
institutions
to
death
where
postwar
chaos
existed
in
industrialized
nations
as
in
western
europe
the
local
stalinists
tried
to
gain
power
through
political
processes
politicallyinspired
strikes
and
every
available
means
for
subverting
free
institutions
to
their
evil
ends
where
conditions
permitted
the
soviet
rulers
have
stimulated
and
aided
armed
insurrection
by
communistled
revolutionary
forces
as
in
greece
indochina
the
philippines
and
china
or
outright
aggression
by
one
of
their
satellites
as
in
korea
where
the
forces
of
nationalism
independence
and
economic
change
were
at
work
throughout
the
great
sweep
of
asia
and
africa
the
communists
tried
to
identify
themselves
with
the
cause
of
progress
tried
to
picture
themselves
as
the
friends
of
freedom
and
advancementsurely
one
of
the
most
cynical
efforts
of
which
history
offers
record
thus
everywhere
in
the
free
world
the
communists
seek
to
fish
in
troubled
waters
to
seize
more
countries
to
enslave
more
millions
of
human
souls
they
were
and
are
ready
to
ally
themselves
with
any
group
from
the
extreme
left
to
the
extreme
right
that
offers
them
an
opportunity
to
advance
their
ends
geography
gives
them
a
central
position
they
are
both
a
european
and
an
asian
power
with
borders
touching
many
of
the
most
sensitive
and
vital
areas
in
the
free
world
around
them
so
situated
they
can
use
their
armies
and
their
economic
power
to
set
up
simultaneously
a
whole
series
of
threatsor
inducementsto
such
widely
dispersed
places
as
western
germany
iran
and
japan
these
pressures
and
attractions
can
be
sustained
at
will
or
quickly
shifted
from
place
to
place
thus
the
communist
rulers
are
moving
with
implacable
will
to
create
greater
strength
in
their
vast
empire
and
to
create
weakness
and
division
in
the
free
world
preparing
for
the
time
their
false
creed
teaches
them
must
come
the
time
when
the
whole
world
outside
their
sway
will
be
so
torn
by
strife
and
contradictions
that
it
will
be
ripe
for
the
communist
plucking
this
is
the
heart
of
the
distorted
marxist
interpretation
of
history
this
is
the
glass
through
which
moscow
and
peiping
look
out
upon
the
world
the
glass
through
which
they
see
the
rest
of
us
they
seem
really
to
believe
that
history
is
on
their
side
and
they
are
trying
to
boost
history
along
at
every
opportunity
in
every
way
they
can
i
have
set
forth
here
the
nature
of
the
communist
menace
confronting
our
republic
and
the
whole
free
world
this
is
the
measure
of
the
challenge
we
have
faced
since
world
war
iia
challenge
partly
military
and
partly
economic
partly
moral
and
partly
intellectual
confronting
us
at
every
level
of
human
endeavor
and
all
around
the
world
it
has
been
and
must
be
the
free
worlds
purpose
not
only
to
organize
defenses
against
aggression
and
subversion
not
only
to
build
a
structure
of
resistance
and
salvation
for
the
community
of
nations
outside
the
iron
curtain
but
in
addition
to
give
expression
and
opportunity
to
the
forces
of
growth
and
progress
in
the
free
world
to
so
organize
and
unify
the
cooperative
community
of
free
men
that
we
will
not
crumble
but
grow
stronger
over
the
years
and
the
soviet
empire
not
the
free
world
will
eventually
have
to
change
its
ways
or
fall
our
whole
program
of
action
to
carry
out
this
purpose
has
been
directed
to
meet
two
requirements
the
first
of
these
had
to
do
with
security
like
the
pioneers
who
settled
this
great
continent
of
ours
we
have
had
to
carry
a
musket
while
we
went
about
our
peaceful
business
we
realized
that
if
we
and
our
allies
did
not
have
military
strength
to
meet
the
growing
soviet
military
threat
we
would
never
have
the
opportunity
to
carry
forward
our
efforts
to
build
a
peaceful
world
of
law
and
orderthe
only
environment
in
which
our
free
institutions
could
survive
and
flourish
did
this
mean
we
had
to
drop
everything
else
and
concentrate
on
armies
and
weapons
of
course
it
did
not
sidebyside
with
this
urgent
military
requirement
we
had
to
continue
to
help
create
conditions
of
economic
and
social
progress
in
the
world
this
work
had
to
be
carried
forward
alongside
the
first
not
only
in
order
to
meet
the
nonmilitary
aspects
of
the
communist
drive
for
power
but
also
because
this
creative
effort
toward
human
progress
is
essential
to
bring
about
the
kind
of
world
we
as
free
men
want
to
live
in
these
two
requirementsmilitary
security
and
human
progressare
more
closely
related
in
action
than
we
sometimes
recognize
military
security
depends
upon
a
strong
economic
underpinning
and
a
stable
and
hopeful
political
order
conversely
the
confidence
that
makes
for
economic
and
political
progress
does
not
thrive
in
areas
that
are
vulnerable
to
military
conquest
these
requirements
are
related
in
another
way
both
of
them
depend
upon
unity
of
action
among
the
free
nations
of
the
world
this
indeed
has
been
the
foundation
of
our
whole
effort
for
the
drawing
together
of
the
free
people
of
the
world
has
become
a
condition
essential
not
only
to
their
progress
but
to
their
survival
as
free
people
this
is
the
conviction
that
underlies
all
the
steps
we
have
been
taking
to
strengthen
and
unify
the
free
nations
during
the
past
seven
years
what
have
these
steps
been
first
of
all
how
have
we
gone
about
meeting
the
requirement
of
providing
for
our
security
against
this
worldwide
challenge
our
starting
point
as
i
have
said
on
many
occasions
has
been
and
remains
the
united
nations
we
were
prepared
and
so
were
the
other
nations
of
the
free
world
to
place
our
reliance
on
the
machinery
of
the
united
nations
to
safeguard
peace
but
before
the
united
nations
could
give
full
expression
to
the
concept
of
international
security
embodied
in
the
charter
it
was
essential
that
the
five
permanent
members
of
the
security
council
honor
their
solemn
pledge
to
cooperate
to
that
end
this
the
soviet
union
has
not
done
i
do
not
need
to
outline
here
the
dreary
record
of
soviet
obstruction
and
veto
and
the
unceasing
efforts
of
the
soviet
representatives
to
sabotage
the
united
nations
it
is
important
however
to
distinguish
clearly
between
the
principle
of
collective
security
embodied
in
the
charter
and
the
mechanisms
of
the
united
nations
to
give
that
principle
effect
we
must
frankly
recognize
that
the
soviet
union
has
been
able
in
certain
instances
to
stall
the
machinery
of
collective
security
yet
it
has
not
been
able
to
impair
the
principle
of
collective
security
the
free
nations
of
the
world
have
retained
their
allegiance
to
that
idea
they
have
found
the
means
to
act
despite
the
soviet
veto
both
through
the
united
nations
itself
and
through
the
application
of
this
principle
in
regional
and
other
security
arrangements
that
are
fully
in
harmony
with
the
charter
and
give
expression
to
its
purposes
the
free
world
refused
to
resign
itself
to
collective
suicide
merely
because
of
the
technicality
of
a
soviet
veto
the
principle
of
collective
measures
to
forestall
aggression
has
found
expression
in
the
treaty
of
rio
de
janeiro
the
north
atlantic
treaty
now
extended
to
include
greece
and
turkey
and
the
several
treaties
we
have
concluded
to
reinforce
security
in
the
pacific
area
but
the
free
nations
have
not
this
time
fallen
prey
to
the
dangerous
illusion
that
treaties
alone
will
stop
an
aggressor
by
a
series
of
vigorous
actions
as
varied
as
the
nature
of
the
threat
the
free
nations
have
successfully
thwarted
aggression
or
the
threat
of
aggression
in
many
different
parts
of
the
world
our
country
has
led
or
supported
these
collective
measures
the
aid
we
have
given
to
people
determined
to
act
in
defense
of
their
freedom
has
often
spelled
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
we

all
know
what
we
have
done
and
i
shall
not
review
in
detail
the
steps
we
have
taken
each
major
step
was
a
milepost
in
the
developing
unity
strength
and
resolute
will
of
the
free
nations
the
first
was
the
determined
and
successful
effort
made
through
the
united
nations
to
safeguard
the
integrity
and
independence
of
iran
in
and
next
was
our
aid
and
support
to
embattled
greece
which
enabled
her
to
defeat
the
forces
threatening
her
national
independence
in
turkey
cooperative
action
resulted
in
building
up
a
bulwark
of
military
strength
for
an
area
vital
to
the
defenses
of
the
entire
free
world
in
we
began
furnishing
military
aid
to
our
partners
in
the
north
atlantic
community
and
to
a
number
of
other
free
countries
the
soviet
unions
threats
against
germany
and
japan
its
neighbors
to
the
west
and
to
the
east
have
been
successfully
withstood
free
germany
is
on
its
way
to
becoming
a
member
of
the
peaceful
community
of
nations
and
a
partner
in
the
common
defense
the
soviet
effort
to
capture
berlin
by
blockade
was
thwarted
by
the
courageous
allied
airlift
an
independent
and
democratic
japan
has
been
brought
back
into
the
community
of
free
nations
in
the
far
east
the
tactics
of
communist
imperialism
have
reached
heights
of
violence
unmatched
elsewhereand
the
problem
of
concerted
action
by
the
free
nations
has
been
at
once
more
acute
and
more
difficult
here
in
spite
of
outside
aid
and
support
the
free
government
of
china
succumbed
to
the
communist
assault
our
aid
has
enabled
the
free
chinese
to
rebuild
and
strengthen
their
forces
on
the
island
of
formosa
in
other
areas
of
the
far
eastin
indochina
malaya
and
the
philippinesour
assistance
has
helped
sustain
a
staunch
resistance
against
communist
insurrectionary
attacks
the
supreme
test
up
to
this
point
of
the
will
and
determination
of
the
free
nations
came
in
korea
when
communist
forces
invaded
the
republic
of
korea
a
state
that
was
in
a
special
sense
under
the
protection
of
the
united
nations
the
response
was
immediate
and
resolute
under
our
military
leadership
the
free
nations
for
the
first
time
took
up
arms
collectively
to
repel
aggression
aggression
was
repelled
driven
back
punished
since
that
time
communist
strategy
has
seen
fit
to
prolong
the
conflict
in
spite
of
honest
efforts
by
the
united
nations
to
reach
an
honorable
truce
the
months
of
deadlock
have
demonstrated
that
the
communists
cannot
achieve
by
persistence
or
by
diplomatic
trickery
what
they
failed
to
achieve
by
sneak
attack
korea
has
demonstrated
that
the
free
world
has
the
will
and
the
endurance
to
match
the
communist
effort
to
overthrow
international
order
through
local
aggression
it
has
been
a
bitter
struggle
and
it
has
cost
us
much
in
brave
lives
and
human
suffering
but
it
has
made
it
plain
that
the
free
nations
will
fight
side
by
side
that
they
will
not
succumb
to
aggression
or
intimidation
one
by
one
this
in
the
final
analysis
is
the
only
way
to
halt
the
communist
drive
to
world
power
at
the
heart
of
the
free
worlds
defense
is
the
military
strength
of
the
united
states
from
to
the
united
states
was
sole
possessor
of
the
atomic
bomb
that
was
a
great
deterrent
and
protection
in
itself
but
when
the
soviets
produced
an
atomic
explosionas
they
were
bound
to
do
in
timewe
had
to
broaden
the
whole
basis
of
our
strength
we
had
to
endeavor
to
keep
our
lead
in
atomic
weapons
we
had
to
strengthen
our
armed
forces
generally
and
to
enlarge
our
productive
capacityour
mobilization
base
historically
it
was
the
soviet
atomic
explosion
in
the
fall
of
nine
months
before
the
aggression
in
korea
which
stimulated
the
planning
for
our
program
of
defense
mobilization
what
we
needed
was
not
just
a
central
force
that
could
strike
back
against
aggression
we
also
needed
strength
along
the
outer
edges
of
the
free
world
defenses
for
our
allies
as
well
as
for
ourselves
strength
to
hold
the
line
against
attack
as
well
as
to
retaliate
we
have
made
great
progress
on
this
task
of
building
strong
defenses
in
the
last
two
and
one
half
years
we
have
more
than
doubled
our
own
defenses
and
we
have
helped
to
increase
the
protection
of
nearly
all
the
other
free
nations
all
the
measures
of
collective
security
resistance
to
aggression
and
the
building
of
defenses
constitute
the
first
requirement
for
the
survival
and
progress
of
the
free
world
but
as
i
have
pointed
out
they
are
interwoven
with
the
necessity
of
taking
steps
to
create
and
maintain
economic
and
social
progress
in
the
free
nations
there
can
be
no
military
strength
except
where
there
is
economic
capacity
to
back
it
there
can
be
no
freedom
where
there
is
economic
chaos
or
social
collapse
for
these
reasons
our
national
policy
has
included
a
wide
range
of
economic
measures
in
europe
the
grand
design
of
the
marshall
plan
permitted
the
people
of
britain
and
france
and
italy
and
a
half
dozen
other
countries
with
help
from
the
united
states
to
lift
themselves
from
stagnation
and
find
again
the
path
of
rising
production
rising
incomes
rising
standards
of
living
the
situation
was
changed
almost
overnight
by
the
marshall
plan
the
people
of
europe
have
a
renewed
hope
and
vitality
and
they
are
able
to
carry
a
share
of
the
military
defense
of
the
free
world
that
would
have
been
impossible
a
few
years
ago
now
the
countries
of
europe
are
moving
rapidly
towards
political
and
economic
unity
changing
the
map
of
europe
in
more
hopeful
ways
than
it
has
been
changed
for
years
customs
unions
european
economic
institutions
like
the
schuman
plan
the
movement
toward
european
political
integration
the
european
defense
communityall
are
signs
of
practical
and
effective
growth
toward
greater
common
strength
and
unity
the
countries
of
western
europe
including
the
free
republic
of
germany
are
working
together
and
the
whole
free
world
is
the
gainer
it
sometimes
happens
in
the
course
of
history
that
steps
taken
to
meet
an
immediate
necessity
serve
an
ultimate
purpose
greater
than
may
be
apparent
at
the
time
this
i
believe
is
the
meaning
of
what
has
been
going
on
in
europe
under
the
threat
of
aggression
the
free
nations
there
with
our
help
have
been
drawing
together
in
defense
of
their
free
institutions
in
so
doing
they
have
laid
the
foundations
of
a
unity
that
will
endure
as
a
major
creative
force
beyond
the
exigencies
of
this
period
of
history
we
may
at
this
close
range
be
but
dimly
aware
of
the
creative
surge
this
movement
represents
but
i
believe
it
to
be
of
historic
importance
i
believe
its
benefits
will
survive
long
after
communist
tyranny
is
nothing
but
an
unhappy
memory
in
asia
and
africa
the
economic
and
social
problems
are
different
but
no
less
urgent
there
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
are
in
ferment
exploding
into
the
twentieth
century
thrusting
toward
equality
and
independence
and
improvement
in
the
hard
conditions
of
their
lives
politically
economically
socially
things
cannot
and
will
not
stay
in
their
prewar
mold
in
africa
and
asia
change

comeis

just
in
the
years
i
have
been

free

with
more
than
million
people

become
independent
burma

the

korea
israel
libya
india
pakistan
and
ceylon
and
the
three
associated
states
of
indochina
now
members
of
the
french
union
these
names
alone
are
testimony
to
the
sweep
of
the
great
force
which
is
changing
the
face
of
half
the
world
working
out
new
relationships
among
the
peoples
of
the
free
world
would
not
be
easy
in
the
best
of
times
even
if
there
were
no
communist
drive
for
expansion
there
would
be
hard
and
complex
problems
of
transition
from
old
social
forms
old
political
arrangements
old
economic
institutions
to
the
new
ones
our
century
demandsproblems
of
guiding
change
into
constructive
channels
of
helping
new
nations
grow
strong
and
stable
but
now
with
the
soviet
rulers
striving
to
exploit
this
ferment
for
their
own
purposes
the
task
has
become
harder
and
more
urgentterribly
urgent
in
this
situation
we
see
the
meaning
and
the
importance
of
the
point
iv
program
through
which
we
can
share
our
store
of
knowhow
and
of
capital
to
help
these
people
develop
their
economies
and
reshape
their
societies
as
we
help
iranians
to
raise
more
grain
indians
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
malaria
liberians
to
educate
their
children
better
we
are
at
once
helping
to
answer
the
desires
of
the
people
for
advancement
and
demonstrating
the
superiority
of
freedom
over
communism
there
will
be
no
quick
solution
for
any
of
the
difficulties
of
the
new
nations
of
asia
and
africabut
there
may
be
no
solution
at
all
if
we
do
not
press
forward
with
full
energy
to
help
these
countries
grow
and
flourish
in
freedom
and
in
cooperation
with
the
rest
of
the
free
world
our
measures
of
economic
policy
have
already
had
a
tremendous
effect
on
the
course
of
events
eight
years
ago
the
kremlin
thought
postwar
collapse
in
western
europe
and
japanwith
economic
dislocation
in
americamight
give
them
the
signal
to
advance
we
demonstrated
they
were
wrong
now
they
wait
with
hope
that
the
economic
recovery
of
the
free
world
has
set
the
stage
for
violent
and
disastrous
rivalry
among
the
economically
developed
nations
struggling
for
each
others
markets
and
a
greater
share
of
trade
here
is
another
test
that
we
shall
have
to
meet
and
master
in
the
years
immediately
ahead
and
it
will
take
great
ingenuity
and
effortand
much
timebefore
we
prove
the
kremlin
wrong
again
but
we
can
do
it
it
is
true
that
economic
recovery
presents
its
problems
as
does
economic
decline
but
they
are
problems
of
another
order
they
are
the
problems
of
distributing
abundance
fairly
and
they
can
be
solved
by
the
process
of
international
cooperation
that
has
already
brought
us
so
far
these
are
the
measures
we
must
continue
this
is
the
path
we
must
follow
we
must
go
on
working
with
our
free
associates
building
an
international
structure
for
military
defense
and
for
economic
social
and
political
progress
we
must
be
prepared
for
war
because
war
may
be
thrust
upon
us
but
the
stakes
in
our
search
for
peace
are
immensely
higher
than
they
have
ever
been
before
for
now
we
have
entered
the
atomic
age

and
war
has
undergone
a
technological
change
which
makes
it
a
very
different
thing
from
what
it
used
to
be
war
today
between
the
soviet
empire
and
the
free
nations
might
dig
the
grave
not
only
of
our
stalinist
opponents
but
of
our
own
society
our
world
as
well
as
theirs
this
transformation
has
been
brought
to
pass
in
the
seven
years
from
alamogordo
to
eniwetok
it
is
only
seven
years
but
the
new
force
of
atomic
energy
has
turned
the
world
into
a
very
different
kind
of
place
science
and
technology
have
worked
so
fast
that
wars
new
meaning
may
not
yet
be
grasped
by
all
the
peoples
who
would
be
its
victims
nor
perhaps
by
the
rulers
in
the
kremlin
but
i
have
been
president
of
the
united
states
these
seven
years
responsible
for
the
decisions
which
have
brought
our
science
and
our
engineering
to
their
present
place
i
know
what
this
development
means
now
i
know
something
of
what
it
will
come
to
mean
in
the
future
we
in
this
government
realized
even
before
the
first
successful
atomic
explosion
that
this
new
force
spelled
terrible
danger
for
all
mankind
unless
it
were
brought
under
international
control
we
promptly
advanced
proposals
in
the
united
nations
to
take
this
new
source
of
energy
out
of
the
arena
of
national
rivalries
to
make
it
impossible
to
use
it
as
a
weapon
of
war
these
proposals
so
pregnant
with
benefit
for
all
humanity
were
rebuffed
by
the
rulers
of
the
soviet
union
the
language
of
science
is
universal
the
movement
of
science
is
always
forward
into
the
unknown
we
could
not
assume
that
the
soviet
union
would
not
develop
the
same
weapon
regardless
of
all
our
precautions
nor
that
there
were
not
other
and
even
more
terrible
means
of
destruction
lying
in
the
unexplored
field
of
atomic
energy
we
had
no
alternative
then
but
to
press
on
to
probe
the
secrets
of
atomic
power
to
the
uttermost
of
our
capacity
to
maintain
if
we
could
our
initial
superiority
in
the
atomic
field
at
the
same
time
we
sought
persistently
for
some
avenue
some
formula
for
reaching
an
agreement
with
the
soviet
rulers
that
would
place
this
new
form
of
power
under
effective
restraintsthat
would
guarantee
no
nation
would
use
it
in
war
i
do
not
have
to
recount
here
the
proposals
we
made
the
steps
taken
in
the
united
nations
striving
at
least
to
open
a
way
to
ultimate
agreement
i
hope
and
believe
that
we
will
continue
to
make
these
efforts
so
long
as
there
is
the
slightest
possibility
of
progress
all
civilized
nations
are
agreed
on
the
urgency
of
the
problem
and
have
shown
their
willingness
to
agree
on
effective
measures
of
controlall
save
the
soviet
union
and
its
satellites
but
they
have
rejected
every
reasonable
proposal
meanwhile
the
progress
of
scientific
experiment
has
outrun
our
expectations
atomic
science
is
in
the
full
tide
of
development
the
unfolding
of
the
innermost
secrets
of
matter
is
uninterrupted
and
irresistible
since
alamogordo
we
have
developed
atomic
weapons
with
many
times
the
explosive
force
of
the
early
models
and
we
have
produced
them
in
substantial
quantities
and
recently
in
the
thermonuclear
tests
at
eniwetok
we
have
entered
another
stage
in
the
worldshaking
development
of
atomic
energy
from
now
on
man
moves
into
a
new
era
of
destructive
power
capable
of
creating
explosions
of
a
new
order
of
magnitude
dwarfing
the
mushroom
clouds
of
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
stage
we
have
now
reached
in
the
release
of
atomic
energy
will
be
the
last
indeed
the
speed
of
our
scientific
and
technical
progress
over
the
last
seven
years
shows
no
signs
of
abating
we
are
being
hurried
forward
in
our
mastery
of
the
atom
from
one
discovery
to
another
toward
yet
unforeseeable
peaks
of
destructive
power
inevitably
until
we
can
reach
international
agreement
this
is
the
path
we
must
follow
and
we
must
realize
that
no
advance
we
make
is
unattainable
by
others
that
no
advantage
in
this
race
can
be
more
than
temporary
the
war
of
the
future
would
be
one
in
which
man
could
extinguish
millions
of
lives
at
one
blow
demolish
the
great
cities
of
the
world
wipe
out
the
cultural
achievements
of
the
pastand
destroy
the
very
structure
of
a
civilization
that
has
been
slowly
and
painfully
built
up
through
hundreds
of
generations
such
a
war
is
not
a
possible
policy
for
rational
men
we
know
this
but
we
dare
not
assume
that
others
would
not
yield
to
the
temptation
science
is
now
placing
in
their
hands
with
that
in
mind
there
is
something
i
would
say
to
stalin
you
claim
belief
in
lenins
prophecy
that
one
stage
in
the
development
of
communist
society
would
be
war
between
your
world
and
ours
but
lenin
was
a
preatomic
man
who
viewed
society
and
history
with
preatomic
eyes
something
profound
has
happened
since
he
wrote
war
has
changed
its
shape
and
its
dimension
it
cannot
now
be
a
stage
in
the
development
of
anything
save
ruin
for
your
regime
and
your
homeland
i
do
not
know
how
much
time
may
elapse
before
the
communist
rulers
bring
themselves
to
recognize
this
truth
but
when
they
do
they
will
find
us
eager
to
reach
understandings
that
will
protect
the
world
from
the
danger
it
faces
today
it
is
no
wonder
that
some
people
wish
that
we
had
never
succeeded
in
splitting
the
atom
but
atomic
power
like
any
other
force
of
nature
is
not
evil
in
itself
properly
used
it
is
an
instrumentality
for
human
betterment
as
a
source
of
power
as
a
tool
of
scientific
inquiry
it
has
untold
possibilities
we
are
already
making
good
progress
in
the
constructive
use
of
atomic
power
we
could
do
much
more
if
we
were
free
to
concentrate
on
its
peaceful
uses
exclusively
atomic
power
will
be
with
us
all
the
days
of
our
lives
we
cannot
legislate
it
out
of
existence
we
cannot
ignore
the
dangers
or
the
benefits
it
offers
i
believe
that
man
can
harness
the
forces
of
the
atom
to
work
for
the
improvement
of
the
lot
of
human
beings
everywhere
that
is
our
goal
as
a
nation
as
a
people
we
must
understand
this
problem
we
must
handle
this
new
force
wisely
through
our
democratic
processes
above
all
we
must
strive
in
all
earnestness
and
good
faith
to
bring
it
under
effective
international
control
to
do
this
will
require
much
wisdom
and
patience
and
firmness
the
aweinspiring
responsibility
in
this
field
now
falls
on
a
new
administration
and
a
new
congress
i
will
give
them
my
support
as
i
am
sure
all
our
citizens
will
in
whatever
constructive
steps
they
may
take
to
make
this
newest
of
mans
discoveries
a
source
of
good
and
not
of
ultimate
destruction
we
cannot
tell
when
or
whether
the
attitude
of
the
soviet
rulers
may
change
we
do
not
know
how
long
it
may
be
before
they
show
a
willingness
to
negotiate
effective
control
of
atomic
energy
and
honorable
settlements
of
other
world
problems
we
cannot
measure
how
deeprooted
are
the
kremlins
illusions
about
us
we
can
be
sure
however
that
the
rulers
of
the
communist
world
will
not
change
their
basic
objectives
lightly
or
soon
the
communist
rulers
have
a
sense
of
time
about
these
things
wholly
unlike
our
own
we
tend
to
divide
our
future
into
short
spans
like
the
twoyear
life
of
this
congress
or
the
four
years
of
the
next
presidential
term
they
seem
to
think
and
plan
in
terms
of
generations
and
there
is
therefore
no
easy
shortrun
way
to
make
them
see
that
their
plans
cannot
prevail
this
means
there
is
ahead
of
us
a
long
hard
test
of
strength
and
stamina
between
the
free

above

this
is
a
test
of
the
will
and
the
steadiness
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
there
has
been
no
challenge
like
this
in
the
history
of
our
republic
we
are
called
upon
to
rise
to
the
occasion
as
no
people
before
us
what
is
required
of
us
is
not
easy
the
way
we
must
learn
to
live
the
world
we
have
to
live
in
cannot
be
so
pleasant
safe
or
simple
as
most
of
us
have
known
before
or
confidently
hoped
to
know
already
we
have
had
to
sacrifice
a
number
of
accustomed
ways
of
working
and
of
living
much
nervous
energy
material
resources
even
human
life
yet
if
one
thing
is
certain
in
our
future
it
is
that
more
sacrifice
still
lies
ahead
were
we
to
grow
discouraged
now
were
we
to
weaken
and
slack
off
the
whole
structure
we
have
built
these
past
eight
years
would
come
apart
and
fall
away
never
then
no
matter
by
what
stringent
means
could
our
free
world
regain
the
ground
the
time
the
sheer
momentum
lost
by
such
a
move
there
can
and
should
be
changes
and
improvements
in
our
programs
to
meet
new
situations
serve
new
needs
but
to
desert
the
spirit
of
our
basic
policies
to
step
back
from
them
now
would
surely
start
the
free
worlds
slide
toward
the
darkness
that
the
communists
have
prophesiedtoward
the
moment
for
which
they
watch
and
wait
if
we
value
our
freedom
and
our
way
of
life
and
want
to
see
them
safe
we
must
meet
the
challenge
and
accept
its
implications
stick
to
our
guns
and
carry
out
our
policies
i
have
set
out
the
basic
conditions
as
i
see
them
under
which
we
have
been
working
in
the
world
and
the
nature
of
our
basic
policies
what
then
of
the
future
the
answer
i
believe
is
this
as
we
continue
to
confound
soviet
expectations
as
our
world
grows
stronger
more
united
more
attractive
to
men
on
both
sides
of
the
iron
curtain
then
inevitably
there
will
come
a
time
of
change
within
the
communist
world
we
do
not
know
how
that
change
will
come
about
whether
by
deliberate
decision
in
the
kremlin
by
coup
detat
by
revolution
by
defection
of
satellites
or
perhaps
by
some
unforeseen
combination
of
factors
such
as
these
but
if
the
communist
rulers
understand
they
cannot
win
by
war
and
if
we
frustrate
their
attempts
to
win
by
subversion
it
is
not
too
much
to
expect
their
world
to
change
its
character
moderate
its
aims
become
more
realistic
and
less
implacable
and
recede
from
the
cold
war
they
began
do
not
be
deceived
by
the
strong
face
the
look
of
monolithic
power
that
the
communist
dictators
wear
before
th
e
outside
world
remember
their
power
has
no
basis
in
consent
remember
they
are
so
afraid
of
the
free
worlds
ideas
and
ways
of
life
they
do
not
dare
to
let
their
people
know
about
them
think
of
the
massive
effort
they
put
forth
to
try
to
stop
our
campaign
of
truth
from
reaching
their
people
with
its
message
of
freedom
the
masters
of
the
kremlin
live
in
fear
their
power
and
position
would
collapse
were
their
own
people
to
acquire
knowledge
information
comprehension
about
our
free
society
their
world
has
many
elements
of
strength
but
this
one
fatal
flaw
the
weakness
represented
by
their
iron
curtain
and
their
police
state
surely
a
social
order
at
once
so
insecure
and
so
fearful
must
ultimately
lose
its
competition
with
our
free
society
provided
just
one
thingand
this
i
urge
you
to
consider
carefullyprovided
that
the
free
world
retains
the
confidence
and
the
determination
to
outmatch
the
best
our
adversary
can
accomplish
and
to
demonstrate
for
uncertain
millions
on
both
sides
of
the
iron
curtain
the
superiority
of
the
free
way
of
life
that
is
the
test
upon
all
the
free
nations
upon
none
more
than
our
own
republic
our
resources
are
equal
to
the
task
we
have
the
industry
the
skills
the
basic
economic
strength
above
all
we
have
the
vigor
of
free
men
in
a
free
society
we
have
our
liberties
and
while
we
keep
them
while
we
retain
our
democratic
faith
the
ultimate
advantage
in
this
hard
competition
lies
with
us
not
with
the
communists
but
there
are
some
things
that
could
shift
the
advantage
to
their
side
one
of
the
things
that
could
defeat
us
is
fearfear
of
the
task
we
face
fear
of
adjusting
to
it
fear
that
breeds
more
fear
sapping
our
faith
corroding
our
liberties
turning
citizen
against
citizen
ally
against
ally
fear
could
snatch
away
the
very
values
we
are
striving
to
defend
already
the
danger
signals
have
gone
up
already
the
corrosive
process
has
begun
and
every
diminution
of
our
tolerance
each
new
act
of
enforced
conformity
each
idle
accusation
each
demonstration
of
hysteriaeach
new
restrictive
lawis
one
more
sign
that
we
can
lose
the
battle
against
fear
the
communists
cannot
deprive
us
of
our
libertiesfear
can
the
communists
cannot
stamp
out
our
faith
in
human
dignityfear
can
fear
is
an
enemy
within
ourselves
and
if
we
do
not
root
it
out
it
may
destroy
the
very
way
of
life
we
are
so
anxious
to
protect
to
beat
back
fear
we
must
hold
fast
to
our
heritage
as
free
men
we
must
renew
our
confidence
in
one
another
our
tolerance
our
sense
of
being
neighbors
fellow
citizens
we
must
take
our
stand
on
the
bill
of
rights
the
inquisition
the
star
chamber
have
no
place
in
a
free
society
our
ultimate
strength
lies
not
alone
in
arms
but
in
the
sense
of
moral
values
and
moral
truths
that
give
meaning
and
vitality
to
the
purposes
of
free
people
these
values
are
our
faith
our
inspiration
the
source
of
our
strength
and
our
indomitable
determination
we
face
hard
tasks
great
dangers
but
we
are
americans
and
we
have
faced
hardships
and
uncertainty
before
we
have
adjusted
before
to
changing
circumstances
our
whole
history
has
been
a
steady
training
for
the
work
it
is
now
ours
to
do
no
one
can
lose
heart
for
the
task
none
can
lose
faith
in
our
free
ways
who
stops
to
remember
where
we
began
what
we
have
sought
and
what
accomplished
all
together
as
americans
i
have
lived
a
long
time
and
seen
much
happen
in
our
country
and
i
know
out
of
my
own
experience
that
we
can
do
what
must
be
done
when
i
think
back
to
the
country
i
grew
up
inand
then
look
at
what
our
country
has
becomei
am
quite
certain
that
having
done
so
much
we
can
do
more
after
all
it
has
been
scarcely
fifteen
years
since
most
americans
rejected
outofhand
the
wise
counsel
that
aggressors
must
be
quarantined
the
very
concept
of
collective
security
the
foundationstone
of
all
our
actions
now
was
then
strange
doctrine
shunned
and
set
aside
talk
about
adapting
talk
about
adjusting
talk
about
responding
as
a
people
to
the
challenge
of
changed
times
and
circumstancesthere
has
never
been
a
more
spectacular
example
than
this
great
change
in
americas
outlook
on
the
world
let
all
of
us
pause
now
think
back
consider
carefully
the
meaning
of
our
national
experience
let
us
draw
comfort
from
it
and
faith
and
confidence
in
our
future
as
americans
the
nations
business
is
never
finished
the
basic
questions
we
have
been
dealing
with
these
eight
years
past
present
themselves
anew
that
is
the
way
of
our
society
circumstances
change
and
current
questions
take
on
different
forms
new
complications
year
by
year
but
underneath
the
great
issues
remain
the
sameprosperity
welfare
human
rights
effective
democracy
and
above
all
peace
now
we
turn
to
the
inaugural
of
our
new
president
and
in
the
great
work
he
is
called
upon
to
do
he
will
have
need
for
the
support
of
a
united
people
a
confident
people
with
firm
faith
in
one
another
and
in
our
common
cause
i
pledge
him
my
support
as
a
citizen
of
our
republic
and
i
ask
you
to
give
him
yours
to
him
to
you
to
all
my
fellow
citizens
i
say
godspeed
may
god
bless
our
country
and
our
cause

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
i
have
the
honor
to
report
to
the
congress
on
the
state
of
the
union
at
the
outset
i
should
like
to
speak
of
the
necessity
for
putting
first
things
first
as
we
work
together
this
year
for
the
good
of
our
country
the
united
states
and
the
whole
free
world
are
passing
through
a
period
of
grave
danger
every
action
you
take
here
in
congress
and
every
action
that
i
take
as
president
must
be
measured
against
the
test
of
whether
it
helps
to
meet
that
danger
this
will
be
a
presidential
election
yearthe
year
in
which
politics
plays
a
large
part
in
our
livesa
larger
part
than
usual
that
is
perfectly
proper
but
we
have
a
greater
responsibility
to
conduct
our
political
fights
in
a
manner
that
does
not
harm
the
national
interest
we
can
find
plenty
of
things
to
differ
about
without
destroying
our
free
institutions
and
without
abandoning
our
bipartisan
foreign
policy
for
peace
when
everything
is
said
and
done
all
of
usrepublicans
and
democrats
alikeall
of
us
are
americans
and
we
are
all
going
to
sink
or
swim
together
we
are
moving
through
a
perilous
time
faced
with
a
terrible
threat
of
aggression
our
nation
has
embarked
upon
a
great
effort
to
help
establish
the
kind
of
world
in
which
peace
shall
be
secure
peace
is
our
goalnot
peace
at
any
price
but
a
peace
based
on
freedom
and
justice
we
are
now
in
the
midst
of
our
effort
to
reach
that
goal
on
the
whole
we
have
been
doing
very
well
last
year
was
a
year
in
which
we
threw
back
aggression
added
greatly
to
our
military
strength
and
improved
the
chances
for
peace
and
freedom
in
many
parts
of
the
world
this
year
is
a
critical
year
in
the
defense
effort
of
the
whole
free
world
if
we
falter
we
can
lose
all
the
gains
we
have
made
if
we
drive
ahead
with
courage
and
vigor
and
determination
we
can
by
the
end
of
be
in
a
position
of
much
greater
security
the
way
will
be
dangerous
for
the
years
ahead
but
if
we
put
forth
our
best
efforts
this
yearand
next
yearwe
can
be
over
the
hump
in
our
effort
to
build
strong
defenses
when
we
look
at
the
record
of
the
past
year
we
find
important
things
on
both
the
credit
and
the
debit
side
of
the
ledger
we
have
made
great
advances
at
the
same
time
we
have
run
into
new
problems
which
must
be
overcome
now
let
us
look
at
the
credit
side
first
peace
depends
upon
the
free
nations
sticking
together
and
making
a
combined
effort
to
check
aggression
and
prevent
war
in
this
respect
was
a
year
of
great
achievement
in
korea
the
forces
of
the
united
nations
turned
hack
the
chinese
communist
invasionand
did
it
without
widening
the
area
of
conflict
the
action
of
the
united
nations
in
korea
has
been
a
powerful
deterrent
to
a
third
world
war
however
the
situation
in
korea
remains
very
hazardous
the
outcome
of
the
armistice
negotiation
still
remains
uncertain
in
indochina
and
malaya
our
aid
has
helped
our
allies
to
hold
back
the
communist
advance
although
there
are
signs
of
further
trouble
in
that
area
in
we
strengthened
the
chances
of
peace
in
the
pacific
region
by
the
treaties
with
japan
and
the
defense
arrangements
with
australia
new
zealand
and
the
philippines
in
europe
combined
defense
has
become
a
reality
the
free
nations
have
created
a
real
fighting
force
this
force
is
not
yet
as
strong
as
it
needs
to
be
but
it
is
already
a
real
obstacle
to
any
attempt
by
hostile
forces
to
sweep
across
europe
to
the
atlantic
in
we
also
moved
to
strengthen
the
security
of
europe
by
the
agreement
to
bring
greece
and
turkey
into
the
north
atlantic
treaty
the
united
nations
the
worlds
greatest
hope
for
peace
has
come
through
a
year
of
trial
stronger
and
more
useful
than
ever
the
free
nations
have
stood
together
in
blocking
communist
attempts
to
tear
up
the
charter
at
the
present
session
of
the
united
nations
in
paris
we
together
with
the
british
and
the
french
offered
a
plan
to
reduce
and
control
all
armaments
under
a
foolproof
inspection
system
this
is
a
concrete
practical
proposal
for
disarmament
but
what
happened
vishinsky
laughed
at
it
listen
to
what
he
said
i
could
hardly
sleep
at
all
last
night
i
could
not
sleep
because
i
kept
laughing
the
world
will
be
a
long
time
forgetting
the
spectacle
of
that
fellow
laughing
at
disarmament
disarmament
is
not
a
joke
vishinskys
laughter
met
with
shock
and
anger
from
the
people
all
over
the
world
and
as
a
result
mr
stalins
representative
received
orders
to
stop
laughing
and
start
talking
if
the
soviet
leaders
were
to
accept
this
proposal
it
would
lighten
the
burden
of
armaments
and
permit
the
resources
of
the
earth
to
be
devoted
to
the
good
of
mankind
but
until
the
soviet
union
accepts
a
sound
disarmament
proposal
and
joins
in
peaceful
settlements
we
have
no
choice
except
to
build
up
our
defenses
during
this
past
year
we
added
more
than
a
million
men
and
women
to
our
armed
forces
the
total
is
now
nearly
million
we
have
made
rapid
progress
in
the
field
of
atomic
weapons
we
have
turned
out
billion
worth
of
military
supplies
and
equipment
three
times
as
much
as
the
year
before
economic
conditions
in
the
country
are
good
there
are
million
people
on
the
job
wages
farm
incomes
and
business
profits
are
at
high
levels
total
production
of
goods
and
services
in
our
country
has
increased
percent
over
last
yearabout
twice
the
normal
rate
of
growth
perhaps
the
most
amazing
thing
about
our
economic
progress
is
the
way
we
are
increasing
our
basic
capacity
to
produce
for
example
we
are
now
in
the
second
year
of
a
year
program
which
will
double
our
output
of
aluminum
increase
our
electric
power
supply
by
percent
and
increase
our
steelmaking
capacity
by
percent
we
can
then
produce
million
tons
of
steel
a
year
as
much
as
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
this
expansion
will
mean
more
jobs
and
higher
standards
of
living
for
all
of
us
in
the
years
ahead
at
the
present
time
it
means
greater
strength
for
us
and
for
the
rest
of
the
free
world
in
the
fight
for
peace
now
i
must
turn
to
the
debit
side
of
the
ledger
for
the
past
year
the
outstanding
fact
to
note
on
the
debit
side
of
the
ledger
is
that
the
soviet
union
in
continued
to
expand
its
military
production
and
increase
its
already
excessive
military
power
it
is
true
that
the
soviets
have
run
into
increasing
difficulties
their
hostile
policies
have
awakened
stern
resistance
among
free
men
throughout
the
world
and
behind
the
iron
curtain
the
soviet
rule
of
force
has
created
growing
political
and
economic
stresses
in
the
satellite
nations
nevertheless
the
grim
fact
remains
that
the
soviet
union
is
increasing
its
armed
might
it
is
still
producing
more
war
planes
than
the
free
nations
it
has
set
off
two
more
atomic
explosions
the
world
still
walks
in
the
shadow
of
another
world
war
and
here
at
home
our
defense
preparations
are
far
from
complete
during
we
did
not
make
adequate
progress
in
building
up
civil
defense
against
atomic
attack
this
is
a
major
weakness
in
our
plans
for
peace
since
inadequate
civilian
defense
is
an
open
invitation
to
a
surprise
attack
failure
to
provide
adequate
civilian
defense
has
the
same
effect
as
adding
to
the
enemys
supply
of
atomic
bombs
in
the
field
of
defense
production
we
have
run
into
difficulties
and
delays
in
designing
and
producing
the
latest
types
of
airplanes
and
tanks
some
machine
tools
and
metals
are
still
in
extremely
short
supply
in
other
free
countries
the
defense
buildup
has
created
severe
economic
problems
it
has
increased
inflation
in
europe
and
has
endangered
the
continued
recovery
of
our
allies
in
the
middle
east
political
tensions
and
the
oil
controversy
in
iran
are
keeping
the
region
in
a
turmoil
in
the
far
east
the
dark
threat
of
communist
imperialism
still
hangs
over
many
nations
this
very
briefly
is
the
good
side
and
the
bad
side
of
the
picture
taking
the
good
and
bad
together
we
have
made
real
progress
this
last
year
along
the
road
to
peace
we
have
increased
the
power
and
unity
of
the
free
world
and
while
we
were
doing
this
we
have
avoided
world
war
on
the
one
hand
and
appeasement
on
the
other
this
is
a
hard
road
to
follow
but
the
events
of
the
last
year
show
that
it
is
the
right
road
to
peace
we
cannot
expect
to
complete
the
job
overnight
the
free
nations
may
have
to
maintain
for
years
the
larger
military
forces
needed
to
deter
aggression
we
must
build
steadily
over
a
period
of
years
toward
political
solidarity
and
economic
progress
among
the
free
nations
in
all
parts
of
the
world
our
task
will
not
be
easy
but
if
we
go
at
it
with
a
will
we
can
look
forward
to
steady
progress
on
our
side
are
all
the
great
resources
of
freedomthe
ideals
of
religion
and
democracy
the
aspiration
of
people
for
a
better
life
and
the
industrial
and
technical
power
of
a
free
civilization
these
advantages
outweigh
anything
the
slave
world
can
produce
the
only
thing
that
can
defeat
us
is
our
own
state
of
mind
we
can
lose
if
we
falter
the
middle
period
of
a
great
national
effort
like
this
is
a
very
difficult
time
the
way
seems
long
and
hard
the
goal
seems
far
distant
some
people
get
discouraged
that
is
only
natural
but
if
there
are
any
among
us
who
think
we
ought
to
ease
up
in
the
fight
for
peace
i
want
to
remind
them
of
three
thingsjust
three
things
first
the
threat
of
world
war
is
still
very
real
we
had
one
pearl
harborlets
not
get
caught
off
guard
again
if
you
dont
think
the
threat
of
communist
armies
is
real
talk
to
some
of
our
men
back
from
korea
second
if
the
united
states
had
to
try
to
stand
alone
against
a
sovietdominated
world
it
would
destroy
the
life
we
know
and
the
ideals
we
hold
dear
our
allies
are
essential
to
us
just
as
we
are
essential
to
them
the
more
shoulders
there
are
to
bear
the
burden
the
lighter
that
burden
will
be
third
the
things
we
believe
in
most
deeply
are
under
relentless
attack
we
have
the
great
responsibility
of
saving
the
basic
moral
and
spiritual
values
of
our
civilization
we
have
started
out
wellwith
a
program
for
peace
that
is
unparalleled
in
history
if
we
believe
in
ourselves
and
the
faith
we
profess
we
will
stick
to
that
job
until
it
is
victoriously
finished
this
is
a
time
for
courage
not
for
grumblin
g
and
mumbling
now
let
us
take
a
look
at
the
things
we
have
to
do
the
thing
that
is
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
all
of
us
is
the
situation
in
korea
we
must
and
we
will
keep
up
the
fight
there
until
we
get
the
kind
of
armistice
that
will
put
an
end
to
the
aggression
and
protect
the
safety
of
our
forces
and
the
security
of
the
republic
of
korea
beyond
that
we
shall
continue
to
work
for
a
settlement
in
korea
that
upholds
the
principles
of
the
united
nations
we
went
into
korea
because
we
knew
that
communist
aggression
had
to
be
met
firmly
if
freedom
was
to
be
preserved
in
the
world
we
went
into
the
fight
to
save
the
republic
of
korea
a
free
country
established
under
the
united
nations
these
are
our
aims
we
will
not
give
up
until
we
attain
them
meanwhile
we
must
continue
to
strengthen
the
forces
of
freedom
throughout
the
world
i
hope
the
senate
will
take
early
and
favorable
action
on
the
japanese
peace
treaty
on
our
security
pacts
with
the
pacific
countries
and
on
the
agreement
to
bring
greece
and
turkey
into
the
north
atlantic
treaty
we
are
also
negotiating
an
agreement
with
the
german
federal
republic
under
which
it
can
play
an
honorable
and
equal
part
among
nations
and
take
its
place
in
the
defense
of
western
europe
but
treaties
and
plans
are
only
the
skeleton
of
our
defense
structure
the
sinew
and
muscle
of
defense
are
the
forces
and
equipment
which
must
be
provided
in
europe
we
must
go
on
helping
our
friends
and
allies
to
build
up
their
military
forces
this
means
we
must
send
weapons
in
large
volume
to
our
european
allies
i
have
directed
that
weapons
for
europe
be
given
a
very
high
priority
economic
aid
is
necessary
too
to
supply
the
margin
of
difference
between
success
and
failure
in
making
europe
a
strong
partner
in
our
joint
defense
in
the
long
run
we
want
to
see
europe
freed
from
any
dependence
on
our
aid
our
european
allies
want
that
just
as
bad
as
we
do
the
steps
that
are
now
being
taken
to
build
european
unity
should
help
bring
that
about
six
european
countries
are
pooling
their
coal
and
steel
production
under
the
schuman
plan
work
is
going
forward
on
the
merger
of
european
national
forces
on
the
continent
into
a
single
army
these
great
projects
should
become
realities
in
we
should
do
all
we
can
to
help
and
encourage
the
move
toward
a
strong
and
united
europe
in
asia
the
new
communist
empire
is
a
daily
threat
to
millions
of
people
the
peoples
of
asia
want
to
be
free
to
follow
their
own
way
of
life
they
want
to
preserve
their
culture
and
their
traditions
against
communism
just
as
much
as
we
want
to
preserve
ours
they
are
laboring
under
terrific
handicapspoverty
ill
health
feudal
systems
of
land
ownership
and
the
threat
of
internal
subversion
or
external
attack
we
can
and
we
must
increase
our
help
to
them
this
means
military
aid
especially
to
those
places
like
indochina
which
might
be
hardest
hit
by
some
new
communist
attack
it
also
means
economic
aid
both
technical
knowhow
and
capital
investment
this
last
year
we
made
available
millions
of
bushels
of
wheat
to
relieve
famine
in
india
but
far
more
important
in
the
long
run
is
the
work
americans
are
doing
in
india
to
help
the
indian
farmers
themselves
raise
more
grain
with
the
help
of
our
technicians
indian
farmers
using
simple
inexpensive
means
have
been
able
since
to
double
the
crops
in
one
area
in
india
one
farmer
there
raised
bushels
of
wheat
to
the
acre
where
bushels
had
been
the
average
before
this
is
point
our
point
program
at
work
it
is
workingnot
only
in
india
but
in
iran
paraguay
liberiain
countries
around
the
globe
our
technical
missionaries
are
out
there
we
need
more
of
them
we
need
more
funds
to
speed
their
efforts
because
there
is
nothing
of
greater
importance
in
all
our
foreign
policy
there
is
nothing
that
shows
more
clearly
what
we
stand
for
and
what
we
want
to
achieve
my
friends
of
the
congress
less
than
onethird
of
the
expenditure
for
the
cost
of
world
war
ii
would
have
created
the
developments
necessary
to
feed
the
whole
world
so
we
wouldnt
have
to
stomach
communism
that
is
what
we
have
got
to
fight
and
unless
we
fight
that
battle
and
win
it
we
cant
win
the
cold
war
or
a
hot
one
either
we
have
recently
lost
a
great
public
servant
who
was
leading
this
effort
to
bring
opportunity
and
hope
to
the
people
of
half
the
world
dr
henry
bennett
and
his
associates
died
in
line
of
duty
on
a
point
mission
it
is
up
to
us
to
carry
on
the
great
work
for
which
they
gave
their
lives
during
the
coming
year
we
must
not
forget
the
suffering
of
the
people
who
live
behind
the
iron
curtain
in
those
areas
minorities
are
being
oppressed
human
rights
violated
religions
persecuted
we
should
continue
to
expose
those
wrongs
we
should
continue
and
expand
the
activities
of
the
voice
of
america
which
brings
our
message
of
hope
and
truth
to
those
peoples
and
other
peoples
throughout
the
world
i
have
just
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
many
of
these
world
problems
with
prime
minister
churchill
we
have
had
a
most
satisfactory
series
of
meetings
we
thoroughly
reviewed
the
situation
in
europe
the
middle
east
and
the
far
east
we
both
look
forward
to
steady
progress
toward
peace
through
the
cooperative
action
and
teamwork
of
the
free
nations
turning
from
our
foreign
policies
let
us
consider
the
jobs
we
have
here
at
home
as
a
part
of
our
program
for
peace
the
first
of
these
jobs
is
to
move
ahead
full
steam
on
the
defense
program
our
objective
is
to
have
a
wellequipped
active
defense
force
large
enoughin
concert
with
the
forces
of
our
alliesto
deter
aggression
and
to
inflict
punishing
losses
on
the
enemy
immediately
if
we
should
be
attacked
this
active
force
must
be
backed
by
adequate
reserves
and
by
the
plants
and
tools
to
turn
out
the
tremendous
quantities
of
new
weapons
that
would
be
needed
if
war
came
we
are
not
building
an
active
force
adequate
to
carry
on
full
scale
war
but
we
are
putting
ourselves
in
a
position
to
mobilize
very
rapidly
if
we
have
to
this
year
i
shall
recommend
some
increases
in
the
size
of
the
active
force
we
are
building
with
particular
emphasis
on
air
power
this
means
we
shall
have
to
continue
largescale
production
of
planes
and
other
equipment
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
we
had
originally
planned
planes
and
tanks
and
other
weaponswhat
the
military
call
hard
goodsare
now
beginning
to
come
off
the
production
lines
in
volume
deliveries
of
hard
goods
now
amount
to
about
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
worth
a
month
a
year
from
now
we
expect
that
rate
to
be
doubled
we
shall
have
to
hold
to
a
high
rate
of
military
output
for
about
a
year
after
that
in
we
hope
to
have
enough
equipment
so
that
we
can
reduce
the
production
of
most
military
items
substantially
the
next
years
should
therefore
be
the
peak
period
of
defense
production
defense
needs
will
take
a
lot
of
steel
aluminum
copper
nickel
and
other
scarce
materials
this
means
smaller
production
of
some
civilian
goods
the
cutbacks
will
be
nothing
like
those
during
world
war
ii
when
most
civilian
production
was
completely
stopped
but
there
will
be
considerably
less
of
some
goods
than
we
have
been
used
to
these
past
or
years
the
very
critical
part
of
our
defense
job
this
year
is
to
keep
down
inflation
we
can
control
inflation
if
we
make
up
our
minds
to
do
it
on
the
executive
side
of
the
government
we
intend
to
hold
the
line
on
prices
just
as
tightly
as
the
law
allows
we
will
permit
only
those
wage
increases
which
are
clearly
justified
under
sound
stabilization
policies
and
we
will
see
to
it
that
industries
absorb
cost
increases
out
of
earnings
wherever
feasible
before
they
are
authorized
to
raise
prices
we
will
do
that
at
any
rate
except
where
the
recent
amendments
to
the
law
specifically
require
us
to
give
further
price
increases
congress
has
a
tremendous
responsibility
in
this
matter
our
stabilization
law
was
shot
full
of
holes
at
the
last
session
this
year
it
will
be
one
of
the
main
tasks
before
the
congress
to
repair
the
damage
and
enact
a
strong
antiinflation
law
as
a
part
of
our
program
to
keep
our
country
strong
we
are
determined
to
preserve
the
financial
strength
of
the
government
this
means
high
taxes
over
the
next
few
years
we
must
see
to
it
that
these
taxes
are
shared
among
the
people
as
fairly
as
possible
i
expect
to
discuss
these
matters
in
the
economic
report
and
the
budget
message
which
will
soon
be
presented
to
the
congress
our
tax
laws
must
be
fair
and
we
must
make
absolutely
certain
they
are
administered
fairly
without
fear
or
favor
of
any
kind
for
anybody
to
this
end
steps
have
already
been
taken
to
remedy
weaknesses
which
have
been
disclosed
in
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws
in
addition
i
hope
the
congress
will
approve
my
reorganization
plan
for
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
we
must
do
everything
necessary
in
order
to
make
just
as
certain
as
is
humanly
possible
that
every
taxpayer
receives
equal
treatment
under
the
law
to
carry
the
burden
of
defense
we
must
have
a
strong
productive
and
expanding
economy
here
at
home
we
cannot
neglect
those
things
that
have
made
us
the
great
and
powerful
nation
we
are
today
our
strength
depends
upon
the
health
the
morale
the
freedom
of
our
people
we
can
take
on
the
burden
of
leadership
in
the
fight
for
world
peace
because
for
nearly
years
the
government
and
the
people
have
been
working
together
for
the
general
welfare
we
have
given
more
and
more
of
out
citizens
a
fair
chance
at
decent
useful
productive
lives
that
is
the
reason
we
are
as
strong
as
we
are
today
this
government
of
oursthe
congress
and
the
executive
bothmust
keep
on
working
to
bring
about
a
fair
deal
for
all
the
american
people
some
people
will
say
that
we
havent
the
time
or
the
money
this
year
for
measures
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
but
if
we
want
to
win
the
fight
for
peace
this
is
a
part
of
the
job
we
cannot
ignore
we
will
have
to
give
up
some
things
we
will
have
to
go
forward
on
others
at
a
slower
pace
but
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
do
not
think
we
can
give
up
the
things
that
are
vital
to
our
national
strength
i
believe
most
people
in
this
country
will
agree
with
me
on
that
i
think
mos
t
farmers
understand
that
soil
conservation
and
rural
electrification
and
agricultural
research
are
not
frills
or
luxuries
but
real
necessities
in
order
to
boost
our
farm
production
i
think
most
workers
understand
that
decent
housing
and
good
working
conditions
are
not
luxuries
but
necessities
if
the
working
men
and
women
of
this
country
are
to
continue
to
outproduce
the
rest
of
the
world
i
think
our
businessmen
know
that
scientific
research
and
transportation
services
and
more
steel
mills
and
power
projects
are
not
luxuries
but
necessities
to
keep
our
business
and
our
industry
in
the
forefront
of
industrial
progress
i
think
everybody
knows
that
social
insurance
and
better
schools
and
health
services
are
not
frills
but
necessities
in
helping
all
americans
to
be
useful
and
productive
citizens
who
can
contribute
their
full
share
in
the
national
effort
to
protect
and
advance
our
way
of
life
we
cannot
do
all
we
want
to
in
times
like
thesewe
have
to
choose
the
things
that
will
contribute
most
to
defensebut
we
must
continue
to
make
progress
if
we
are
to
be
a
strong
nation
in
the
years
ahead
let
me
give
you
some
examples
we
are
going
right
ahead
with
the
urgently
needed
work
to
develop
our
natural
resources
to
conserve
our
soil
and
to
prevent
floods
we
are
going
to
produce
essential
power
and
build
the
lines
that
are
necessary
and
that
we
have
to
have
to
transmit
it
to
our
farms
and
factories
we
are
going
to
encourage
exploration
for
new
mineral
deposits
we
are
going
to
keep
on
building
essential
highways
and
taking
any
other
steps
that
will
assure
the
nation
an
adequate
transportation
systemon
land
on
the
sea
and
in
the
air
we
must
move
right
ahead
this
year
to
see
that
defense
workers
and
soldiers
families
get
decent
housing
at
rents
they
can
afford
to
pay
we
must
begin
our
long
deferred
program
of
federal
aid
to
educationto
help
the
states
meet
the
present
crisis
in
the
operation
of
our
schools
and
we
must
help
with
the
construction
of
schools
in
areas
where
they
are
critically
needed
because
of
the
defense
effort
we
urgently
need
to
train
more
doctors
and
other
health
personnel
through
aid
to
medical
education
we
also
urgently
need
to
expand
the
basic
public
health
services
in
our
home
communitiesespecially
in
defense
areas
the
congress
should
go
ahead
with
these
two
measures
immediately
i
have
set
up
an
impartial
commission
to
make
a
thorough
study
of
the
nations
health
needs
one
of
the
things
this
commission
is
looking
into
is
how
to
bring
the
cost
of
modern
medical
care
within
the
reach
of
all
the
people
i
have
repeatedly
recommended
national
health
insurance
as
the
best
way
to
do
this
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
still
the
best
way
if
there
are
any
better
answers
i
hope
this
commission
will
find
them
but
of
one
thing
i
am
sure
something
must
be
done
and
done
soon
this
year
we
ought
to
make
a
number
of
urgently
needed
improvements
in
our
social
security
law
for
one
thing
benefits
under
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
should
be
raised
a
month
above
the
present
average
of
for
another
thing
the
states
should
be
given
special
aid
to
help
them
increase
public
assistance
payments
by
doing
these
things
now
we
can
ease
the
pressure
of
living
costs
for
people
who
depend
on
those
fixed
payments
we
should
also
make
some
costofliving
adjustments
for
those
receiving
veterans
compensation
for
death
or
disability
incurred
in
the
service
of
our
country
in
addition
now
is
the
time
to
start
a
sensible
program
of
readjustment
benefits
for
our
veterans
who
have
seen
service
since
the
fighting
broke
out
in
korea
another
thing
the
congress
should
do
at
this
session
is
to
strengthen
our
system
of
farm
price
supports
to
meet
the
defense
emergency
the
sliding
scale
in
the
price
support
law
should
not
be
allowed
to
penalize
farmers
for
increasing
production
to
meet
defense
needs
we
should
also
find
a
new
and
less
costly
method
for
supporting
perishable
commodities
than
the
law
now
provides
we
need
to
act
promptly
to
improve
our
labor
law
the
tafthartley
act
has
many
serious
and
farreaching
defects
experience
has
demonstrated
this
so
clearly
that
even
the
sponsors
of
the
act
now
admit
that
it
needs
to
be
changed
a
fair
law
fair
to
both
management
and
labor
is
indispensable
to
sound
labor
relations
and
to
full
uninterrupted
production
i
intend
to
keep
on
working
for
a
fair
law
until
we
get
one
as
we
build
our
strength
to
defend
the
freedom
in
the
world
we
ourselves
must
extend
the
benefits
of
freedom
more
widely
among
all
our
own
people
we
need
to
take
action
toward
the
wider
enjoyment
of
civil
rights
freedom
is
the
birthright
of
every
american
the
executive
branch
has
been
making
real
progress
toward
full
equality
of
treatment
and
opportunityin
the
armed
forces
in
the
civil
service
and
in
private
firms
working
for
the
government
further
advances
require
action
by
congress
and
i
hope
that
means
will
be
provided
to
give
the
members
of
the
senate
and
the
house
a
chance
to
vote
on
them
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
home
rule
for
the
district
of
columbia
will
be
the
first
item
of
business
before
the
senate
i
hope
that
it
as
well
as
statehood
for
hawaii
and
alaska
will
be
adopted
promptly
all
these
measures
i
have
been
talking
aboutmeasures
to
advance
the
wellbeing
of
our
peopledemonstrate
to
the
world
the
forward
movement
of
our
free
society
this
demonstration
of
the
way
free
men
govern
themselves
has
a
more
powerful
influence
on
the
people
of
the
worldon
both
sides
of
the
iron
curtainthan
all
the
trick
slogans
and
pieinthesky
promises
of
the
communists
but
our
shortcomings
as
well
as
our
progress
are
watched
from
abroad
and
there
is
one
shortcoming
i
want
to
speak
about
plainly
our
kind
of
government
above
all
others
cannot
tolerate
dishonesty
among
public
servants
some
dishonest
people
worm
themselves
into
almost
every
human
organization
it
is
all
the
more
shocking
however
when
they
make
their
way
into
a
government
such
as
ours
which
is
based
on
the
principle
of
justice
for
all
such
unworthy
public
servants
must
be
weeded
out
i
intend
to
see
to
it
that
federal
employees
who
have
been
guilty
of
misconduct
are
punished
for
it
i
also
intend
to
see
to
it
that
the
honest
and
hardworking
great
majority
of
our
federal
employees
are
protected
against
partisan
slander
and
malicious
attack
i
have
already
made
some
recommendations
to
the
congress
to
help
accomplish
these
purposes
i
intend
to
submit
further
recommendations
to
this
end
i
will
welcome
the
wholehearted
cooperation
of
the
congress
in
this
effort
i
also
think
that
the
congress
can
do
a
great
deal
to
strengthen
confidence
in
our
institutions
by
applying
rigorous
standards
of
moral
integrity
to
its
own
operations
and
by
finding
an
effective
way
to
control
campaign
expenditures
and
by
protecting
the
rights
of
individuals
in
congressional
investigations
to
meet
the
crisis
which
now
hangs
over
the
world
we
need
many
different
kinds
of
strengthmilitary
economic
political
and
moral
and
of
all
these
i
am
convinced
that
moral
strength
is
the
most
vital
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
it
is
the
courage
and
the
character
of
our
nationand
of
each
one
of
us
as
individualsthat
will
really
decide
how
well
we
meet
this
challenge
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
undertaking
at
home
and
abroadthe
greatest
in
fact
that
any
nation
has
ever
been
privileged
to
embark
upon
we
are
working
night
and
day
to
bring
peace
to
the
world
and
to
spread
the
democratic
ideals
of
justice
and
selfgovernment
to
all
people
our
accomplishments
are
already
remarkable
we
ought
to
be
full
of
pride
in
what
we
are
doing
and
full
of
confidence
and
hope
in
the
outcome
no
nation
ever
had
greater
resources
or
greater
energy
or
nobler
traditions
to
inspire
it
and
yet
day
in
and
day
out
we
see
a
long
procession
of
timid
and
fearful
men
who
wring
their
hands
and
cry
out
that
we
have
lost
the
way
that
we
dont
know
what
we
are
doing
that
we
are
bound
to
fail
some
say
we
should
give
up
the
struggle
for
peace
and
others
say
we
should
have
a
war
and
get
it
over
with
thats
a
terrible
statement
i
had
heard
it
made
but
they
want
us
to
forget
the
great
objective
of
preventing
another
world
warthe
objective
for
which
our
soldiers
have
been
fighting
in
the
hills
of
korea
if
we
are
to
be
worthy
of
all
that
has
been
done
for
us
by
our
soldiers
in
the
field
we
must
be
true
to
the
ideals
for
which
they
are
fighting
we
must
reject
the
counsels
of
defeat
and
despair
we
must
have
the
determination
to
complete
the
great
work
for
which
our
men
have
laid
down
their
lives
in
all
we
do
we
should
remember
who
we
are
and
what
we
stand
for
we
are
americans
our
forefathers
had
far
greater
obstacles
than
we
have
and
much
poorer
chances
of
success
they
did
not
lose
heart
or
turn
aside
from
their
goals
in
the
darkest
of
all
winters
in
american
history
at
valley
forge
george
washington
said
we
must
not
in
so
great
a
contest
expect
to
meet
with
nothing
but
sunshine
with
that
spirit
they
won
their
fight
for
freedom
we
must
have
that
same
faith
and
vision
in
the
great
contest
in
which
we
are
engaged
today
we
cannot
expect
to
have
fair
weather
all
the
way
but
it
is
a
contest
just
as
important
for
this
country
and
for
all
men
as
the
desperate
struggle
that
george
washington
fought
through
to
victory
let
us
prove
again
that
we
are
not
merely
sunshine
patriots
and
summer
soldiers
let
us
go
forward
trusting
in
the
god
of
peace
to
win
the
goals
we
seek

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
this
d
congress
faces
as
grave
a
task
as
any
congress
in
the
history
of
our
republic
the
actions
you
take
will
be
watched
by
the
whole
world
these
actions
will
measure
the
ability
of
a
free
people
acting
through
their
chosen
representatives
and
their
free
institutions
to
meet
a
deadly
challenge
to
their
way
of
life
we
can
meet
this
challenge
foolishly
or
wisely
we
can
meet
it
timidly
or
bravely
shamefully
or
honorably
i
know
that
the
d
congress
will
meet
this
challenge
in
a
way
worthy
of
our
great
heritage
i
know
that
your
debates
will
be
earnest
responsible
constructive
and
to
the
point
i
know
that
from
these
debates
there
will
come
the
great
decisions
needed
to
carry
us
forward
at
this
critical
time
i
am
glad
to
say
that
our
country
is
in
a
healthy
condition
our
democratic
institutions
are
sound
and
strong
we
have
more
men
and
women
at
work
than
ever
before
we
are
able
to
produce
more
than
ever
beforein
fact
far
more
than
any
country
ever
produced
in
the
history
of
the
world
i
am
confident
that
we
can
succeed
in
the
great
task
that
lies
before
us
we
will
succeed
but
we
must
all
do
our
part
we
must
all
act
together
as
citizens
of
this
great
republic
as
we
meet
here
today
american
soldiers
are
fighting
a
bitter
campaign
in
korea
we
pay
tribute
to
their
courage
devotion
and
gallantry
our
men
are
fighting
alongside
their
united
nations
allies
because
they
know
as
we
do
that
the
aggression
in
korea
is
part
of
the
attempt
of
the
russian
communist
dictatorship
to
take
over
the
world
step
by
step
our
men
are
fighting
a
long
way
from
home
but
they
are
fighting
for
our
lives
and
our
liberties
they
are
fighting
to
protect
our
right
to
meet
here
todayour
right
to
govern
ourselves
as
a
free
nation
the
threat
of
world
conquest
by
soviet
russia
endangers
our
liberty
and
endangers
the
kind
of
world
in
which
the
free
spirit
of
man
can
survive
this
threat
is
aimed
at
all
peoples
who
strive
to
win
or
defend
their
own
freedom
and
national
independence
indeed
the
state
of
our
nation
is
in
great
part
the
state
of
our
friends
and
allies
throughout
the
world
the
gun
that
points
at
them
points
at
us
also
the
threat
is
a
total
threat
and
the
danger
is
a
common
danger
all
free
nations
are
exposed
and
all
are
in
peril
their
only
security
lies
in
banding
together
no
one
nation
can
find
protection
in
a
selfish
search
for
a
safe
haven
from
the
storm
the
free
nations
do
not
have
any
aggressive
purpose
we
want
only
peace
in
the
worldpeace
for
all
countries
no
threat
to
the
security
of
any
nation
is
concealed
in
our
plans
and
programs
we
had
hoped
that
the
soviet
union
with
its
security
assured
by
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
would
be
willing
to
live
and
let
live
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
has
not
been
the
case
the
imperialism
of
the
czars
has
been
replaced
by
the
even
more
ambitious
more
crafty
and
more
menacing
imperialism
of
the
rulers
of
the
soviet
union
this
new
imperialism
has
powerful
military
forces
it
is
keeping
millions
of
men
under
arms
it
has
a
large
air
force
and
a
strong
submarine
force
it
has
complete
control
of
the
men
and
equipment
of
its
satellites
it
has
kept
its
subject
peoples
and
its
economy
in
a
state
of
perpetual
mobilization
the
present
rulers
of
the
soviet
union
have
shown
that
they
are
willing
to
use
this
power
to
destroy
the
free
nations
and
win
domination
over
the
whole
world
the
soviet
imperialists
have
two
ways
of
going
about
their
destructive
work
they
use
the
method
of
subversion
and
internal
revolution
and
they
use
the
method
of
external
aggression
in
preparation
for
either
of
these
methods
of
attack
they
stir
up
class
strife
and
disorder
they
encourage
sabotage
they
put
out
poisonous
propaganda
they
deliberately
try
to
prevent
economic
improvement
if
their
efforts
are
successful
they
foment
a
revolution
as
they
did
in
czechoslovakia
and
china
and
as
they
tried
unsuccessfully
to
do
in
greece
if
their
methods
of
subversion
are
blocked
and
if
they
think
they
can
get
away
with
outright
warfare
they
resort
to
external
aggression
this
is
what
they
did
when
they
loosed
the
armies
of
their
puppet
states
against
the
republic
of
korea
in
an
evil
war
by
proxy
we
of
the
free
world
must
be
ready
to
meet
both
of
these
methods
of
soviet
action
we
must
not
neglect
one
or
the
other
the
free
world
has
power
and
resources
to
meet
these
two
forms
of
aggressionresources
that
are
far
greater
than
those
of
the
soviet
dictatorship
we
have
skilled
and
vigorous
peoples
great
industrial
strength
and
abundant
sources
of
raw
materials
and
above
all
we
cherish
liberty
our
common
ideals
are
a
great
part
of
our
strength
these
ideals
are
the
driving
force
of
human
progress
the
free
nations
believe
in
the
dignity
and
the
worth
of
man
we
believe
in
independence
for
all
nations
we
believe
that
free
and
independent
nations
can
band
together
into
a
world
order
based
on
law
we
have
laid
the
cornerstone
of
such
a
peaceful
world
in
the
united
nations
we
believe
that
such
a
world
order
can
and
should
spread
the
benefits
of
modern
science
and
industry
better
health
and
education
more
food
and
rising
standards
of
livingthroughout
the
world
these
ideals
give
our
cause
a
power
and
vitality
that
russian
communism
can
never
command
the
free
nations
however
are
bound
together
by
more
than
ideals
they
are
a
real
community
bound
together
also
by
the
ties
of
selfinterest
and
selfpreservation
if
they
should
fall
apart
the
results
would
be
fatal
to
human
freedom
our
own
national
security
is
deeply
involved
with
that
of
the
other
free
nations
while
they
need
our
support
we
equally
need
theirs
our
national
safety
would
be
gravely
prejudiced
if
the
soviet
union
were
to
succeed
in
harnessing
to
its
war
machine
the
resources
and
the
manpower
of
the
free
nations
on
the
borders
of
its
empire
if
western
europe
were
to
fall
to
soviet
russia
it
would
double
the
soviet
supply
of
coal
and
triple
the
soviet
supply
of
steel
if
the
free
countries
of
asia
and
africa
should
fall
to
soviet
russia
we
would
lose
the
sources
of
many
of
our
most
vital
raw
materials
including
uranium
which
is
the
basis
of
our
atomic
power
and
soviet
command
of
the
manpower
of
the
free
nations
of
europe
and
asia
would
confront
us
with
military
forces
which
we
could
never
hope
to
equal
in
such
a
situation
the
soviet
union
could
impose
its
demands
on
the
world
without
resort
to
conflict
simply
through
the
preponderance
of
its
economic
and
military
power
the
soviet
union
does
not
have
to
attack
the
united
states
to
secure
domination
of
the
world
it
can
achieve
its
ends
by
isolating
us
and
swallowing
up
all
our
allies
therefore
even
if
we
were
craven
enough
i
do
not
believe
we
could
bebut
i
say
even
if
we
were
craven
enough
to
abandon
our
ideals
it
would
be
disastrous
for
us
to
withdraw
from
the
community
of
free
nations
we
are
the
most
powerful
single
member
of
this
community
and
we
have
a
special
responsibility
we
must
take
the
leadership
in
meeting
the
challenge
to
freedom
and
in
helping
to
protect
the
rights
of
independent
nations
this
country
has
a
practical
realistic
program
of
action
for
meeting
this
challenge
first
we
shall
have
to
extend
economic
assistance
where
it
can
be
effective
the
best
way
to
stop
subversion
by
the
kremlin
is
to
strike
at
the
roots
of
social
injustice
and
economic
disorder
people
who
have
jobs
homes
and
hopes
for
the
future
will
defend
themselves
against
the
underground
agents
of
the
kremlin
our
programs
of
economic
aid
have
done
much
to
turn
back
communism
in
europe
the
marshall
plan
has
had
an
electrifying
result
as
european
recovery
progressed
the
strikes
led
by
the
kremlins
agents
in
italy
and
france
failed
all
over
western
europe
the
communist
party
took
worse
and
worse
beatings
at
the
polls
the
countries
which
have
received
marshall
plan
aid
have
been
able
through
hard
work
to
expand
their
productive
strengthin
many
cases
to
levels
higher
than
ever
before
in
their
history
without
this
strength
they
would
be
completely
incapable
of
defending
themselves
today
they
are
now
ready
to
use
this
strength
in
helping
to
build
a
strong
combined
defense
against
aggression
we
shall
need
to
continue
some
economic
aid
to
european
countries
this
aid
should
now
be
specifically
related
to
the
building
of
their
defenses
in
other
parts
of
the
world
our
economic
assistance
will
need
to
be
more
broadly
directed
toward
economic
development
in
the
near
east
in
africa
in
asia
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
help
people
who
are
striving
to
advance
from
misery
poverty
and
hunger
we
must
also
continue
to
help
the
economic
growth
of
our
good
neighbors
in
this
hemisphere
these
actions
will
bring
greater
strength
for
the
free
world
they
will
give
many
people
a
real
stake
in
the
future
and
reason
to
defend
their
freedom
they
will
mean
increased
production
of
goods
they
need
and
materials
we
need
second
we
shall
need
to
continue
our
military
assistance
to
countries
which
want
to
defend
themselves
the
heart
of
our
common
defense
effort
is
the
north
atlantic
community
the
defense
of
europe
is
the
basis
for
the
defense
of
the
whole
free
worldourselves
included
next
to
the
united
states
europe
is
the
largest
workshop
in
the
world
it
is
also
a
homeland
of
the
great
religious
beliefs
shared
by
many
of
our
citizens
beliefs
which
are
now
threatened
by
the
tide
of
atheistic
communism
strategically
economically
and
morally
the
defense
of
europe
is
a
part
of
our
own
defense
that
is
why
we
have
joined
with
the
countries
of
europe
in
the
north
atlantic
treaty
pledging
ourselves
to
work
with
them
there
has
been
much
discussion
recently
over
whether
the
european
countries
are
willing
to
defend
themselves
their
actions
are
answering
this
question
our
north
atlantic
treaty
partners
have
strict
systems
of
universal
military
training
several
have
recently
increased
the
term
of
service
all
have
taken
measures
to
improve
the
quality
of
training
forces
are
being
trained
and
expanded
as
rapidly
as
the
necessary
arms
and
equipment
can
be
supplied
from
their
factories
and
our
s
our
north
atlantic
treaty
partners
together
are
building
armies
bigger
than
our
own
none
of
the
north
atlantic
treaty
countries
including
our
own
country
has
done
enough
yet
but
real
progress
is
being
made
together
we
have
worked
out
defense
plans
the
military
leaders
of
our
own
country
took
part
in
working
out
these
plans
and
are
agreed
that
they
are
sound
and
within
our
capabilities
to
put
these
plans
into
action
we
sent
to
europe
last
week
one
of
our
greatest
military
commanders
general
dwight
d
eisenhower
general
eisenhower
went
to
europe
to
assume
command
of
the
united
forces
of
the
north
atlantic
treaty
countries
including
our
own
forces
in
germany
the
people
of
europe
have
confidence
in
general
eisenhower
they
know
his
ability
to
put
together
a
fighting
force
of
allies
his
mission
is
vital
to
our
security
we
should
all
stand
behind
him
and
give
him
every
bit
of
help
we
can
part
of
our
job
will
be
to
reinforce
the
military
strength
of
our
european
partners
by
sending
them
weapons
and
equipment
as
our
military
production
expands
our
program
of
military
assistance
extends
to
the
nations
in
the
near
east
and
the
far
east
which
are
trying
to
defend
their
freedom
soviet
communism
is
trying
to
make
these
nations
into
colonies
and
to
use
their
people
as
cannon
fodder
in
new
wars
of
conquest
we
want
their
people
to
be
free
men
and
to
enjoy
peace
our
country
has
always
stood
for
freedom
for
the
peoples
of
asia
long
long
ago
it
stood
for
the
freedom
of
the
peoples
of
asia
our
history
shows
this
we
have
demonstrated
it
in
the
philippines
we
have
demonstrated
it
in
our
relations
with
indonesia
india
and
with
china
we
hope
to
join
in
restoring
the
people
of
japan
to
membership
in
the
community
of
free
nations
it
is
in
the
far
east
that
we
have
taken
up
arms
under
the
united
nations
to
preserve
the
principle
of
independence
for
free
nations
we
are
fighting
to
keep
the
forces
of
communist
aggression
from
making
a
slave
state
out
of
korea
korea
has
tremendous
significance
for
the
world
it
means
that
free
nations
acting
through
the
united
nations
are
fighting
together
against
aggression
we
will
understand
the
importance
of
this
best
if
we
look
back
into
history
if
the
democracies
had
stood
up
against
the
invasion
of
manchuria
in
or
the
attack
on
ethiopia
in
or
the
seizure
of
austria
in
if
they
had
stood
together
against
aggression
on
those
occasions
as
the
united
nations
has
done
in
korea
the
whole
history
of
our
time
would
have
been
different
the
principles
for
which
we
are
fighting
in
korea
are
right
and
just
they
are
the
foundations
of
collective
security
and
of
the
future
of
free
nations
korea
is
not
only
a
country
undergoing
the
torment
of
aggression
it
is
also
a
symbol
it
stands
for
right
and
justice
in
the
world
against
oppression
and
slavery
the
free
world
must
always
stand
for
these
principlesand
we
will
stand
with
the
free
world
as
the
third
part
of
our
program
we
will
continue
to
work
for
peaceful
settlements
in
international
disputes
we
will
support
the
united
nations
and
remain
loyal
to
the
great
principles
of
international
cooperation
laid
down
in
its
charter
we
are
willing
as
we
have
always
been
to
negotiate
honorable
settlements
with
the
soviet
union
but
we
will
not
engage
in
appeasement
the
soviet
rulers
have
made
it
clear
that
we
must
have
strength
as
well
as
right
on
our
side
if
we
build
our
strengthand
we
are
building
itthe
soviet
rulers
may
face
the
facts
and
lay
aside
their
plans
to
take
over
the
world
that
is
what
we
hope
will
happen
and
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
bring
about
that
is
the
only
realistic
road
to
peace
these
are
the
main
elements
of
the
course
our
nation
must
follow
as
a
member
of
the
community
of
free
nations
these
are
the
things
we
must
do
to
preserve
our
security
and
help
create
a
peaceful
world
but
they
will
be
successful
only
if
we
increase
the
strength
of
our
own
country
here
at
home
we
have
some
very
big
jobs
to
do
we
are
building
much
stronger
military
forcesand
we
are
building
them
fast
we
are
preparing
for
full
wartime
mobilization
if
that
should
be
necessary
and
we
are
continuing
to
build
a
strong
and
growing
economy
able
to
maintain
whatever
effort
may
be
required
for
as
long
as
necessary
we
are
building
our
own
army
navy
and
air
force
to
an
active
strength
of
nearly
million
men
and
women
we
are
stepping
up
the
training
of
the
reserve
forces
and
establishing
more
training
facilities
so
that
we
can
rapidly
increase
our
active
forces
far
more
on
short
notice
we
are
going
to
produce
all
the
weapons
and
equipment
that
such
an
armed
force
will
need
furthermore
we
will
make
weapons
for
our
allies
and
weapons
for
our
own
reserve
supplies
on
top
of
this
we
will
build
the
capacity
to
turn
out
on
short
notice
arms
and
supplies
that
may
be
needed
for
a
fullscale
war
fortunately
we
have
a
good
start
on
this
because
of
our
enormous
plant
capacity
and
because
of
the
equipment
on
hand
from
the
last
war
for
example
many
combat
ships
are
being
returned
to
active
duty
from
the
mothball
fleet
and
many
others
can
be
put
into
service
on
very
short
notice
we
have
large
reserves
of
arms
and
ammunition
and
thousands
of
workers
skilled
in
arms
production
in
many
cases
however
our
stocks
of
weapons
are
low
in
other
cases
those
on
hand
are
not
the
most
modern
we
have
made
remarkable
technical
advances
we
have
developed
new
types
of
jet
planes
and
powerful
new
tanks
we
are
concentrating
on
producing
the
newest
types
of
weapons
and
producing
them
as
fast
as
we
can
this
production
drive
is
more
selective
than
the
one
we
had
during
world
war
ii
but
it
is
just
as
urgent
and
intense
it
is
a
big
program
and
it
is
a
costly
one
let
me
give
you
two
concrete
examples
our
present
program
calls
for
expanding
the
aircraft
industry
so
that
it
will
have
the
capacity
to
produce
modern
military
planes
a
year
we
are
preparing
the
capacity
to
produce
tanks
a
year
we
are
not
now
ordering
that
many
planes
or
that
many
tanks
and
we
hope
that
we
never
have
to
but
we
mean
to
be
able
to
turn
them
out
if
we
need
them
the
planes
we
are
producing
now
are
much
bigger
much
better
and
much
more
expensive
than
the
planes
we
had
during
the
last
war
we
used
to
think
that
the
b
was
a
huge
plane
and
the
blockbuster
it
carried
a
huge
load
but
the
b
can
carry
five
of
these
blockbusters
in
its
belly
and
it
can
carry
them
five
times
as
far
of
course
the
b
is
much
more
complicated
to
build
than
the
b
and
far
more
expensive
one
b
costs
while
now
one
b
costs
million
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
what
we
are
doing
is
to
provide
the
best
and
most
modern
military
equipment
in
the
world
for
our
fighting
forces
this
kind
of
defense
production
program
has
two
parts
the
first
part
is
to
get
our
defense
production
going
as
fast
as
possible
we
have
to
convert
plants
and
channel
materials
to
defense
production
this
means
heavy
cuts
in
civilian
uses
of
copper
aluminum
rubber
and
other
essential
materials
it
means
shortages
in
various
consumer
goods
the
second
part
is
to
increase
our
capacity
to
produce
and
to
keep
our
economy
strong
for
the
long
pull
we
do
not
know
how
long
communist
aggression
will
threaten
the
world
only
by
increasing
our
output
can
we
carry
the
burden
of
preparedness
for
an
indefinite
period
in
the
future
this
means
that
we
will
have
to
build
more
power
plants
and
more
steel
mills
grow
more
cotton
mine
more
copper
and
expand
our
capacity
in
many
other
ways
the
congress
will
need
to
consider
legislation
at
this
session
affecting
all
the
aspects
of
our
mobilization
job
the
main
subjects
on
which
legislation
will
be
needed
are
first
appropriations
for
our
military
buildup
second
extension
and
revision
of
the
selective
service
act
third
military
and
economic
aid
to
help
build
up
the
strength
of
the
free
world
fourth
revision
and
extension
of
the
authority
to
expand
production
and
to
stabilize
prices
wages
and
rents
fifth
improvement
of
our
agricultural
laws
to
help
obtain
the
kinds
of
farm
products
we
need
for
the
defense
effort
sixth
improvement
of
our
labor
laws
to
help
provide
stable
labormanagement
relations
and
to
make
sure
that
we
have
steady
production
in
this
emergency
seventh
housing
and
training
of
defense
workers
and
the
full
use
of
all
our
manpower
resources
eighth
means
for
increasing
the
supply
of
doctors
nurses
and
other
trained
medical
personnel
critically
needed
for
the
defense
effort
ninth
aid
to
the
states
to
meet
the
most
urgent
needs
of
our
elementary
and
secondary
schools
some
of
our
plans
will
have
to
be
deferred
for
the
time
being
but
we
should
do
all
we
can
to
make
sure
our
children
are
being
trained
as
good
and
useful
citizens
in
the
critical
times
ahead
tenth
a
major
increase
in
taxes
to
meet
the
cost
of
the
defense
effort
the
economic
report
and
the
budget
message
will
discuss
these
subjects
further
in
addition
i
shall
send
to
the
congress
special
messages
containing
detailed
recommendations
on
legislation
needed
at
this
session
in
the
months
ahead
the
government
must
give
priority
to
activities
that
are
urgentlike
military
procurement
and
atomic
energy
and
power
development
it
must
practice
rigid
economy
in
its
nondefense
activities
many
of
the
things
we
would
normally
do
must
be
curtailed
or
postponed
but
in
a
longterm
defense
effort
like
this
one
we
cannot
neglect
the
measures
needed
to
maintain
a
strong
economy
and
a
healthy
democratic
society
the
congress
therefore
should
give
continued
attention
to
the
measures
which
our
country
will
need
for
the
long
pull
and
it
should
act
upon
such
legislation
as
promptly
as
circumstances
permit
to
take
just
one
examplewe
need
to
continue
and
complete
the
work
of
rounding
out
our
system
of
social
insurance
we
still
need
to
improve
our
protection
against
unemployment
and
old
age
we
still
need
to
provide
insurance
against
the
loss
of
earnings
through
sickness
and
against
the
high
costs
of
modern
medical
care
and
above
all
we
must
remember
that
the
fundamentals
of
our
strength
rest
upon
the
freedoms
of
our
people
we
must
continue
our
efforts
to
achieve
the
full
realiz
ation
of
our
democratic
ideals
we
must
uphold
the
freedom
of
speech
and
the
freedom
of
conscience
in
our
land
we
must
assure
equal
rights
and
equal
opportunities
to
all
our
citizens
as
we
go
forward
this
year
in
the
defense
of
freedom
let
us
keep
dearly
before
us
the
nature
of
our
present
effort
we
are
building
up
our
strength
in
concert
with
other
free
nations
to
meet
the
danger
of
aggression
that
has
been
turned
loose
on
the
world
the
strength
of
the
free
nations
is
the
worlds
best
hope
of
peace
i
ask
the
congress
for
unity
in
these
crucial
days
make
no
mistake
about
my
meaning
i
do
not
ask
or
expect
unanimity
i
do
not
ask
for
an
end
to
debate
only
by
debate
can
we
arrive
at
decisions
which
are
wise
and
which
reflect
the
desires
of
the
american
people
we
do
not
have
a
dictatorship
in
this
country
and
we
never
will
have
one
in
this
country
when
i
request
unity
what
i
am
really
asking
for
is
a
sense
of
responsibility
on
the
part
of
every
member
of
this
congress
let
us
debate
the
issues
but
let
every
man
among
us
weigh
his
words
and
his
deeds
there
is
a
sharp
difference
between
harmful
criticism
and
constructive
criticism
if
we
are
truly
responsible
as
individuals
i
am
sure
that
we
will
be
unified
as
a
government
let
us
keep
our
eyes
on
the
issues
and
work
for
the
things
we
all
believe
in
let
each
of
us
put
our
country
ahead
of
our
party
and
ahead
of
our
own
personal
interests
i
had
the
honor
to
be
a
member
of
the
senate
during
world
war
ii
and
i
know
from
experience
that
unity
of
purpose
and
of
effort
is
possible
in
the
congress
without
any
lessening
of
the
vitality
of
our
twoparty
system
let
us
all
stand
together
as
americans
let
us
stand
together
with
all
men
everywhere
who
believe
in
human
liberty
peace
is
precious
to
us
it
is
the
way
of
life
we
strive
for
with
all
the
strength
and
wisdom
we
possess
but
more
precious
than
peace
are
freedom
and
justice
we
will
fight
if
fight
we
must
to
keep
our
freedom
and
to
prevent
justice
from
being
destroyed
these
are
the
things
that
give
meaning
to
our
lives
and
which
we
acknowledge
to
be
greater
than
ourselves
this
is
our
causepeace
freedom
justice
we
will
pursue
this
cause
with
determination
and
humility
asking
divine
guidance
that
in
all
we
do
we
may
follow
the
will
of
god

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
a
year
ago
i
reported
to
this
congress
that
the
state
of
the
union
was
good
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
report
to
you
today

the
state
of
the
union
continues
to
be
good
our
republic
continues
to
increase
in
the
enjoyment
of
freedom
within
its
borders
and
to
offer
strength
and
encouragement
to
all
those
who
love
freedom
throughout
the
world
during
the
past
year
we
have
made
notable
progress
in
strengthening
the
foundations
of
peace
and
freedom
abroad
and
at
home
we
have
taken
important
steps
in
securing
the
north
atlantic
community
against
aggression
we
have
continued
our
successful
support
of
european
recovery
we
have
returned
to
our
established
policy
of
expanding
international
trade
through
reciprocal
agreement
we
have
strengthened
our
support
of
the
united
nations
while
great
problems
still
confront
us
the
greatest
danger
has
recededthe
possibility
which
faced
us
years
ago
that
most
of
europe
and
the
mediterranean
area
might
collapse
under
totalitarian
pressure
today
the
free
peoples
of
the
world
have
new
vigor
and
new
hope
for
the
cause
of
peace
in
our
domestic
affairs
we
have
made
notable
advances
toward
broader
opportunity
and
a
better
life
for
all
our
citizens
we
have
met
and
reversed
the
first
significant
downturn
in
economic
activity
since
the
war
in
accomplishing
this
government
programs
for
maintaining
employment
and
purchasing
power
have
been
of
tremendous
benefit
as
the
result
of
these
programs
and
the
wisdom
and
good
judgment
of
our
businessmen
and
workers
major
readjustments
have
been
made
without
widespread
suffering
during
the
past
year
we
have
also
made
a
good
start
in
providing
housing
for
lowincome
groups
we
have
raised
minimum
wages
we
have
gone
forward
with
the
development
of
our
natural
resources
we
have
given
a
greater
assurance
of
stability
to
the
farmer
and
we
have
improved
the
organization
and
efficiency
of
our
government
today
by
the
grace
of
god
we
stand
a
free
and
prosperous
nation
with
greater
possibilities
for
the
future
than
any
people
ever
had
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
we
are
now
in
this
year
of
nearing
the
midpoint
of
the
th
century
the
first
half
of
this
century
will
be
known
as
the
most
turbulent
and
eventful
period
in
recorded
history
the
swift
pace
of
events
promises
to
make
the
next
years
decisive
in
the
history
of
man
on
this
planet
the
scientific
and
industrial
revolution
which
began
two
centuries
ago
has
in
the
last
years
caught
up
the
peoples
of
the
globe
in
a
common
destiny
two
worldshattering
wars
have
proved
that
no
corner
of
the
earth
can
be
isolated
from
the
affairs
of
mankind
the
human
race
has
reached
a
turning
point
man
has
opened
the
secrets
of
nature
and
mastered
new
powers
if
he
uses
them
wisely
he
can
reach
new
heights
of
civilization
if
he
uses
them
foolishly
they
may
destroy
him
man
must
create
the
moral
and
legal
framework
for
the
world
which
will
insure
that
his
new
powers
are
used
for
good
and
not
for
evil
in
shaping
the
outcome
the
people
of
the
united
states
will
play
a
leading
role
among
all
the
great
changes
that
have
occurred
in
the
last
years
none
is
more
important
than
the
change
in
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
world
affairs
fifty
years
ago
we
were
a
country
devoted
largely
to
our
own
internal
affairs
our
industry
was
growing
and
we
had
new
interests
in
the
far
east
and
in
the
caribbean
but
we
were
primarily
concerned
with
the
development
of
vast
areas
of
our
own
continental
territory
today
our
population
has
doubled
our
national
production
has
risen
from
about
billion
in
terms
of
todays
prices
to
the
staggering
figure
of
billion
a
year
we
have
a
more
productive
economic
system
and
a
greater
industrial
potential
than
any
other
nation
on
the
globe
our
standard
of
living
is
an
inspiration
for
all
other
peoples
even
the
slightest
changes
in
our
economic
and
social
life
have
their
effect
on
other
countries
all
around
the
world
our
tremendous
strength
has
brought
with
it
tremendous
responsibilities
we
have
moved
from
the
outer
edge
to
the
center
of
world
affairs
other
nations
look
to
us
for
a
wise
exercise
of
our
economic
and
military
strength
and
for
vigorous
support
of
the
ideals
of
representative
government
and
a
free
society
we
will
not
fail
them
our
objective
in
the
world
is
peace
our
country
has
joined
with
others
in
the
task
of
achieving
peace
we
know
now
that
this
is
not
an
easy
task
or
a
short
one
but
we
are
determined
to
see
it
through
both
of
our
great
political
parties
are
committed
to
working
togetherand
i
am
sure
they
will
continue
to
work
togetherto
achieve
this
end
we
are
prepared
to
devote
our
energy
and
our
resources
to
this
task
because
we
know
that
our
own
security
and
the
future
of
mankind
are
at
stake
right
here
i
want
to
say
that
no
one
appreciates
more
than
i
the
bipartisan
cooperation
in
foreign
affairs
which
has
been
enjoyed
by
this
administration
our
success
in
working
with
other
nations
to
achieve
peace
depends
largely
on
what
we
do
at
home
we
must
preserve
our
national
strength
strength
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
arms
and
force
it
is
a
matter
of
economic
growth
and
social
health
and
vigorous
institutions
public
and
private
we
can
achieve
peace
only
if
we
maintain
our
productive
energy
our
democratic
institutions
and
our
firm
belief
in
individual
freedom
our
surest
guide
in
the
days
that
lie
ahead
will
be
the
spirit
in
which
this
great
republic
was
rounded
we
must
make
our
decisions
in
the
conviction
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
equally
entitled
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
that
the
duty
of
government
is
to
serve
these
ends
this
country
of
ours
has
experienced
many
blessings
but
none
greater
than
its
dedication
to
these
principles
at
every
point
in
our
history
these
ideals
have
served
to
correct
our
failures
and
shortcomings
to
spur
us
on
to
greater
efforts
and
to
keep
clearly
before
us
the
primary
purpose
of
our
existence
as
a
nation
they
have
enshrined
for
us
a
principle
of
government
the
moral
imperative
to
do
justice
and
the
divine
command
to
men
to
love
one
another
these
principles
give
meaning
to
all
that
we
do
in
foreign
policy
they
mean
that
we
can
never
be
tolerant
of
oppression
or
tyranny
they
mean
that
we
must
throw
our
weight
on
the
side
of
greater
freedom
and
a
better
life
for
all
peoples
these
principles
confirm
us
in
carrying
out
the
specific
programs
for
peace
which
we
have
already
begun
we
shall
continue
to
give
our
wholehearted
support
to
the
united
nations
we
believe
that
this
organization
can
ultimately
provide
the
framework
of
international
law
and
morality
without
which
mankind
cannot
survive
it
has
already
set
up
new
standards
for
the
conduct
of
nations
in
the
declaration
of
human
rights
and
the
convention
on
genocide
it
is
moving
ahead
to
give
meaning
to
the
concept
of
world
brotherhood
through
a
wide
variety
of
cultural
economic
and
technical
activities
the
events
of
the
past
year
again
showed
the
value
of
the
united
nations
in
bringing
about
the
peaceful
adjustment
of
tense
international
controversies
in
indonesia
and
in
palestine
the
efforts
of
the
united
nations
have
put
a
stop
to
bloodshed
and
paved
the
way
to
peaceful
settlements
we
are
working
toward
the
time
when
the
united
nations
will
control
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
will
have
the
forces
to
preserve
international
law
and
order
while
the
world
remains
unsettled
however
and
as
long
as
our
own
security
and
the
security
of
the
free
world
require
we
will
maintain
a
strong
and
wellbalanced
defense
organization
the
selective
service
system
is
an
essential
part
of
our
defense
plans
and
it
must
be
continued
under
the
principles
of
the
united
nations
charter
we
must
continue
to
share
in
the
common
defense
of
free
nations
against
aggression
at
the
last
session
this
congress
laid
the
basis
for
this
joint
effort
we
now
must
put
into
effect
the
common
defense
plans
that
are
being
worked
out
we
shall
continue
our
efforts
for
world
economic
recovery
because
world
prosperity
is
the
only
sure
foundation
of
a
permanent
peace
as
an
immediate
means
to
this
end
we
must
continue
our
support
of
the
european
recovery
program
this
program
has
achieved
great
success
in
the
first
years
of
its
operation
but
it
has
not
yet
been
completed
if
we
were
to
stop
this
program
now
or
cripple
it
just
because
it
is
succeeding
we
should
be
doing
exactly
what
the
enemies
of
democracy
want
us
to
do
we
should
be
just
as
foolish
as
a
man
who
for
reasons
of
false
economy
failed
to
put
a
roof
on
his
house
after
building
the
foundation
and
the
walls
world
prosperity
also
requires
that
we
do
all
we
can
to
expand
world
trade
as
a
major
step
in
this
direction
we
should
promptly
join
the
international
trade
organization
the
purpose
of
this
organization
which
the
united
states
has
been
foremost
in
creating
is
to
establish
a
code
of
fair
practice
and
an
international
authority
for
adjusting
differences
in
international
commercial
relations
it
is
an
effort
to
prevent
the
kind
of
anarchy
and
irresponsibility
in
world
trade
which
did
so
much
to
bring
about
the
world
depression
of
the
s
an
expanding
world
economy
requires
the
improvement
of
living
standards
and
the
development
of
resources
in
areas
where
human
poverty
and
misery
now
prevail
without
such
improvement
the
recovery
of
europe
and
the
future
of
our
own
economy
will
not
be
secure
i
urge
that
the
congress
adopt
the
legislation
now
before
it
to
provide
for
increasing
the
flow
of
technical
assistance
and
capital
investment
in
underdeveloped
regions
it
is
more
essential
now
than
ever
if
the
ideals
of
freedom
and
representative
government
are
to
prevail
in
these
areas
and
particularly
in
the
far
east
that
their
peoples
experience
in
their
own
lives
the
benefits
of
scientific
and
economic
advances
this
program
will
require
the
movement
of
large
amounts
of
capital
from
the
industrial
nations
and
particularly
from
the
united
states
to
productive
uses
in
the
underdeveloped
areas
of
the
world
recent
world
events
make
prompt
action
imper
ative
this
program
is
in
the
interest
of
all
peoplesand
has
nothing
in
common
with
either
the
old
imperialism
of
the
last
century
or
the
new
imperialism
of
the
communists
our
aim
for
a
peaceful
democratic
world
of
free
peoples
will
be
achieved
in
the
long
run
not
by
force
of
arms
but
by
an
appeal
to
the
minds
and
hearts
of
men
if
the
peace
policy
of
the
democratic
nations
is
to
be
successful
they
must
demonstrate
that
the
benefits
of
their
way
of
life
can
be
increased
and
extended
to
all
nations
and
all
races
in
the
world
today
we
are
confronted
with
the
danger
that
the
rising
demand
of
people
everywhere
for
freedom
and
a
better
life
may
be
corrupted
and
betrayed
by
the
false
promises
of
communism
in
its
ruthless
struggle
for
power
communism
seizes
upon
our
imperfections
and
takes
advantage
of
the
delays
and
setbacks
which
the
democratic
nations
experience
in
their
effort
to
secure
a
better
life
for
their
citizens
this
challenge
to
us
is
more
than
a
military
challenge
it
is
a
challenge
to
the
honesty
of
our
profession
of
the
democratic
faith
it
is
a
challenge
to
the
efficiency
and
stability
of
our
economic
system
it
is
a
challenge
to
the
willingness
to
work
with
other
peoples
for
world
peace
and
for
world
prosperity
for
my
part
i
welcome
that
challenge
i
believe
that
our
country
at
this
crucial
point
in
world
history
will
meet
that
challenge
successfully
i
believe
that
in
cooperation
with
the
other
free
nations
of
the
world
we
shall
extend
the
full
benefits
of
the
democratic
way
of
life
to
millions
who
do
not
now
enjoy
them
and
preserve
mankind
from
dictatorship
and
tyranny
i
believe
that
we
shall
succeed
in
our
struggle
for
this
peace
because
i
have
seen
the
success
we
have
had
in
our
own
country
in
following
the
principles
of
freedom
over
the
last
years
the
ideals
of
liberty
and
equal
opportunity
to
which
this
nation
is
dedicated
have
been
increasingly
realized
in
the
lives
of
our
people
the
ideal
of
equal
opportunity
no
longer
means
simply
the
opportunity
which
a
man
has
to
advance
beyond
his
fellows
some
of
our
citizens
do
achieve
greater
success
than
others
as
a
reward
for
individual
merit
and
effort
and
this
is
as
it
should
be
at
the
same
time
our
country
must
be
more
than
a
land
of
opportunity
for
a
select
few
it
must
be
a
land
of
opportunity
for
all
of
us
in
such
a
land
we
can
grow
and
prosper
together
the
simple
truth
that
we
can
all
go
forward
together
is
often
questioned
by
selfish
or
shortsighted
persons
it
is
strange
that
this
is
so
for
this
proposition
is
so
clearly
demonstrated
by
our
national
history
during
the
last
years
for
example
our
nation
has
grown
enormously
in
material
wellbeing
this
growth
has
come
about
not
by
concentrating
the
benefits
of
our
progress
in
the
hands
of
a
few
but
by
increasing
the
wealth
of
the
great
body
of
our
nation
and
our
citizens
in
the
last
years
the
income
of
the
average
family
has
increased
so
greatly
that
its
buying
power
has
doubled
the
average
hours
of
work
have
declined
from
to
a
week
the
whole
hourly
production
of
the
average
worker
has
tripled
average
wages
allowing
for
price
changes
have
increased
from
about
cents
an
hour
to
an
hour
we
have
accomplished
what
to
earlier
ages
of
mankind
would
have
been
a
miraclewe
work
shorter
hours
we
produce
more
and
we
live
better
increasing
freedom
from
poverty
and
drudgery
has
given
a
fuller
meaning
to
american
life
our
people
are
better
educated
we
have
more
opportunities
for
travel
and
recreation
and
enjoyment
of
the
arts
we
enjoy
more
personal
liberty
in
the
united
states
today
than
ever
before
if
we
can
continue
in
the
spirit
of
cooperative
adventure
which
has
marked
the
recent
years
of
our
progress
we
can
expect
further
scientific
advances
further
increases
in
our
standard
of
living
and
a
still
wider
enjoyment
of
democratic
freedom
no
one
of
course
can
foretell
the
future
exactly
however
if
we
assume
that
we
shall
grow
as
fast
in
the
future
as
we
have
grown
in
the
past
we
can
get
a
good
idea
of
how
much
our
country
should
grow
in
the
next
years
at
present
our
total
national
production
is
billion
a
year
our
working
population
and
our
output
per
worker
are
increasing
if
our
productive
power
continues
to
increase
at
the
same
rate
as
it
has
increased
over
the
past
years
our
total
national
production
years
from
now
will
be
nearly
four
times
as
much
as
it
is
today
allowing
for
the
expected
growth
in
population
this
would
mean
that
the
real
income
of
the
average
family
in
the
year
ad
would
be
about
three
times
what
it
is
today
these
are
estimates
of
what
we
can
do
in
the
future
but
we
can
reach
these
heights
only
if
we
follow
the
right
policies
we
have
learned
by
bitter
experience
that
progress
is
not
automaticthat
wrong
policies
lead
to
depression
and
disaster
we
cannot
achieve
these
gains
unless
we
have
a
stable
economy
and
avoid
the
catastrophes
of
boom
and
bust
that
have
set
us
back
in
the
past
these
gains
cannot
be
achieved
unless
our
businessmen
maintain
their
spirit
of
initiative
and
enterprise
and
operate
in
a
competitive
economy
they
cannot
be
achieved
unless
our
workingmen
and
women
and
their
unions
help
to
increase
productivity
and
obtain
for
labor
a
fair
share
of
the
benefits
of
our
economic
system
they
cannot
be
achieved
unless
we
have
a
stable
and
prosperous
agriculture
they
cannot
be
achieved
unless
we
conserve
and
develop
our
natural
resources
in
the
public
interest
our
system
will
not
work
unless
our
people
are
healthy
welleducated
and
confident
of
the
future
it
will
not
work
unless
all
citizens
can
participate
fully
in
our
national
life
in
achieving
these
gains
the
government
has
a
special
responsibility
to
help
create
and
maintain
the
conditions
which
will
permit
the
growth
we
know
is
possible
foremost
among
these
conditions
is
the
need
for
a
fair
distribution
of
our
increasing
prosperity
among
all
the
great
groups
of
our
population
who
help
to
bring
it
aboutlabor
business
agriculture
businessmen
must
continue
to
have
the
incentives
necessary
for
investment
and
for
the
development
of
new
lines
of
enterprise
in
the
future
growth
of
this
country
lie
possibilities
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
and
independent
businesses
as
our
national
production
increases
as
it
doubles
and
redoubles
in
the
next
years
the
number
of
independent
and
competing
enterprises
should
also
increase
if
the
number
does
not
increase
our
constantly
growing
economy
will
fall
under
the
control
of
a
few
dominant
economic
groups
whose
powers
will
be
so
great
that
they
will
be
a
challenge
to
democratic
institutions
to
avoid
this
danger
we
must
curb
monopoly
and
provide
aids
to
independent
business
so
that
it
may
have
the
credit
and
capital
to
compete
in
a
system
of
free
enterprise
i
recommend
that
the
congress
complete
action
at
this
session
on
the
pending
bill
to
close
the
loopholes
in
the
clayton
act
which
now
permit
monopolistic
mergers
i
also
hope
before
this
session
is
over
to
transmit
to
the
congress
a
series
of
proposals
to
strengthen
the
antimonopoly
laws
to
assist
small
business
and
to
encourage
the
growth
of
new
enterprises
in
the
case
of
labor
free
collective
bargaining
must
be
protected
and
encouraged
collective
bargaining
is
not
only
a
fundamental
economic
freedom
for
labor
it
is
also
a
strengthening
and
stabilizing
influence
for
our
whole
economy
the
federal
statute
now
governing
labor
relations
is
punitive
in
purpose
and
onesided
in
operation
this
statute
is
and
always
has
been
inconsistent
with
the
practice
of
true
and
effective
collective
bargaining
it
should
be
repealed
and
replaced
by
a
law
that
is
fair
to
all
and
in
harmony
with
our
democratic
ideals
a
full
understanding
of
the
problems
of
modern
labor
relations
is
of
such
importance
that
i
recommend
the
establishment
of
a
labor
extension
service
to
encourage
educational
activities
in
this
field
another
essential
for
our
continued
growth
is
a
stable
and
prosperous
agriculture
for
many
years
we
have
been
building
a
program
to
give
the
farmer
a
reasonable
measure
of
protection
against
the
special
hazards
to
which
he
is
exposed
that
program
was
improved
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
however
our
farm
legislation
is
still
not
adequate
although
the
congress
has
properly
declared
as
a
matter
of
national
policy
that
safeguards
must
be
maintained
against
slumps
in
farm
prices
there
are
serious
shortcomings
in
the
methods
now
available
for
carrying
out
this
policy
mandatory
price
supports
should
be
provided
for
the
commodities
not
now
covered
which
are
major
sources
of
farm
income
moreover
we
should
provide
a
method
of
supporting
farm
income
at
fair
levels
which
will
at
the
same
time
avoid
piling
up
unmanageable
surpluses
and
allow
consumers
to
obtain
the
full
benefit
of
our
abundant
agricultural
production
a
system
of
production
payments
gives
the
greatest
promise
of
accomplishing
this
purpose
i
recommend
that
the
use
of
such
a
system
be
authorized
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
our
continued
growth
is
the
construction
of
more
good
uptodate
housing
in
a
country
such
as
ours
there
is
no
reason
why
decent
homes
should
not
be
within
the
reach
of
all
with
the
help
of
various
government
programs
we
have
made
great
progress
in
the
last
few
years
in
increasing
the
number
of
homes
despite
this
increase
there
is
still
an
acute
shortage
of
housing
for
the
lower
and
middleincome
groups
especially
in
large
metropolitan
areas
we
have
laid
the
groundwork
for
relieving
the
plight
of
lowerincome
families
in
the
housing
act
of
to
aid
the
middleincome
families
i
recommend
that
the
congress
enact
new
legislation
authorizing
a
vigorous
program
to
help
cooperatives
and
other
nonprofit
groups
build
housing
which
these
families
can
afford
rent
control
has
done
a
great
deal
to
prevent
the
housing
shortage
from
having
had
worse
effects
during
this
postwar
period
of
adjustment
rent
control
is
still
necessary
to
prevent
widespread
hardship
and
sharp
curtailment
of
the
buying
power
of
millions
of
consumers
in
metropolitan
areas
i
recommend
therefore
that
rent
control
be
continued
for
anot
her
year
if
we
are
to
achieve
a
better
life
for
all
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
must
be
regarded
as
a
public
trust
we
must
use
our
precious
assets
of
soil
water
and
forest
and
grassland
in
such
a
way
that
they
become
constantly
more
productive
and
more
valuable
government
investment
in
the
conservation
and
development
of
our
resources
is
necessary
to
the
future
economic
expansion
of
the
country
we
need
to
enlarge
the
production
and
transmission
of
public
power
that
is
true
not
only
in
those
regions
which
have
already
received
great
benefits
from
federal
power
projects
but
also
in
regions
such
as
new
england
where
the
benefits
of
largescale
public
power
development
have
not
yet
been
experienced
in
our
hydroelectric
and
irrigation
undertakings
as
well
as
in
our
other
resource
programs
we
must
continue
policies
to
assure
that
their
benefits
will
be
spread
among
the
many
and
not
restricted
to
the
favored
few
important
resource
legislation
which
should
be
passed
at
this
session
includes
the
authorization
of
the
st
lawrence
seaway
and
power
project
and
the
establishment
of
the
columbia
valley
administrationthe
establishment
of
the
columbia
valley
administration
i
dont
want
you
to
miss
that
through
wise
government
policies
and
government
expenditures
for
the
conservation
and
development
of
our
natural
resources
we
can
be
sure
of
transmitting
to
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
a
country
far
richer
and
more
productive
than
the
one
we
know
today
the
value
of
our
natural
resources
is
constantly
being
increased
by
the
progress
of
science
research
is
finding
new
ways
of
using
such
natural
assets
as
minerals
sea
water
and
plant
life
in
the
peaceful
development
of
atomic
energy
particularly
we
stand
on
the
threshold
of
new
wonders
the
first
experimental
machines
for
producing
useful
power
from
atomic
energy
are
now
under
construction
we
have
made
only
the
first
beginnings
in
this
field
but
in
the
perspective
of
history
they
may
loom
larger
than
the
first
airplane
or
even
the
first
tools
that
started
man
on
the
road
to
civilization
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
increasing
possibilities
of
nature
we
must
equip
ourselves
with
increasing
knowledge
government
has
a
responsibility
to
see
that
our
country
maintains
its
position
in
the
advance
of
science
as
a
step
toward
this
end
the
congress
should
complete
action
on
the
measure
to
create
a
national
science
foundation
another
duty
of
the
government
is
to
promote
the
economic
security
the
health
and
the
education
of
its
citizens
by
so
doing
we
strengthen
both
our
economy
and
the
structure
of
our
society
in
a
nation
as
rich
as
ours
all
citizens
should
be
able
to
live
in
decency
and
health
our
social
security
system
should
be
developed
into
the
main
reliance
of
our
people
for
basic
protection
against
the
economic
hazards
of
oldage
unemployment
and
illness
i
earnestly
hope
that
the
congress
will
complete
action
at
this
session
on
legislation
to
increase
the
benefits
and
extend
the
coverage
of
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
the
widespread
movement
to
provide
pensions
in
private
industry
dramatizes
the
need
for
improvements
in
the
public
insurance
system
i
also
urge
that
the
congress
strengthen
our
unemployment
compensation
law
to
meet
presentday
needs
more
adequately
the
economic
downturn
of
the
past
year
was
the
first
real
test
that
our
system
of
unemployment
insurance
has
had
to
meet
that
test
has
proved
the
wisdom
of
the
system
but
it
has
also
made
strikingly
apparent
the
need
for
improving
its
operation
and
increasing
its
coverage
and
its
benefits
in
the
field
of
health
there
are
immense
opportunities
to
extend
to
more
of
our
people
the
benefits
of
the
amazing
advances
in
medical
science
we
have
made
a
good
beginning
in
expanding
our
hospitals
but
we
must
also
go
on
to
remedy
the
shortages
of
doctors
nurses
and
public
health
services
and
to
establish
a
system
of
medical
insurance
which
will
enable
all
americans
to
afford
good
medical
care
we
must
take
immediate
steps
to
strengthen
our
educational
system
in
many
parts
of
our
country
young
people
are
being
handicapped
for
life
because
of
a
poor
education
the
rapidly
increasing
number
of
children
of
school
age
coupled
with
the
shortage
of
qualified
teachers
makes
this
problem
more
critical
each
year
i
believe
that
the
congress
should
no
longer
delay
in
providing
federal
assistance
to
the
states
so
that
they
can
maintain
adequate
schools
as
we
go
forward
in
achieving
greater
economic
security
and
greater
opportunity
for
all
our
people
we
should
make
every
effort
to
extend
the
benefits
of
our
democratic
institutions
to
every
citizen
the
religious
ideals
which
we
profess
and
the
heritage
of
freedom
which
we
have
received
from
the
past
clearly
place
that
duty
upon
us
i
again
urge
the
congress
to
enact
the
civil
rights
proposals
i
made
in
february
these
proposals
are
for
the
enactment
of
federal
statutes
which
will
protect
all
our
people
in
the
exercise
of
their
democratic
rights
and
their
search
for
economic
opportunity
grant
statehood
to
alaska
and
hawaii
provide
a
greater
measure
of
selfgovernment
for
our
island
possessions
and
accord
home
rule
to
the
district
of
columbia
some
of
those
proposals
have
been
before
the
congress
for
a
long
time
those
who
oppose
them
as
well
as
those
who
favor
them
should
recognize
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
to
let
these
proposals
come
to
a
vote
our
democratic
ideals
as
well
as
our
best
interests
require
that
we
do
our
fair
share
in
providing
homes
for
the
unfortunate
victims
of
war
and
tyranny
in
so
doing
we
shall
add
strength
to
our
democracy
through
the
abilities
and
skills
which
these
men
and
women
will
bring
here
i
urge
the
prompt
enactment
by
the
congress
of
the
legislation
now
before
it
to
extend
and
broaden
the
existing
displaced
persons
law
and
remove
its
discriminatory
features
the
measures
i
am
recommending
to
the
congress
concerning
both
our
foreign
and
our
domestic
policies
represent
a
carefully
considered
program
to
meet
our
national
needs
it
is
a
program
which
necessarily
requires
large
expenditures
of
funds
more
than
percent
of
the
governments
expenditures
are
required
to
meet
the
costs
of
past
wars
and
to
work
for
world
peace
this
is
the
dominant
factor
in
our
fiscal
policy
at
the
same
time
the
government
must
make
substantial
expenditures
which
are
necessary
to
the
growth
and
expansion
of
the
domestic
economy
at
present
largely
because
of
the
illconsidered
tax
reduction
of
the
both
congress
the
government
is
not
receiving
enough
revenue
to
meet
its
necessary
expenditures
to
meet
this
situation
i
am
proposing
that
federal
expenditures
be
held
to
the
lowest
levels
consistent
with
our
international
requirements
and
the
essential
needs
of
economic
growth
and
the
wellbeing
of
our
people
i
think
i
had
better
read
that
over
you
interrupted
me
in
the
middle
to
meet
this
situation
i
am
proposing
that
federal
expenditures
be
held
to
the
lowest
levels
consistent
with
our
international
requirements
and
the
essential
needs
of
economic
growth
and
the
wellbeing
of
our
people
dont
forget
that
last
phrase
at
the
same
time
we
must
guard
against
the
folly
of
attempting
budget
slashes
which
would
impair
our
prospects
for
peace
or
cripple
the
programs
essential
to
our
national
strength
the
budget
recommendations
i
shall
shortly
transmit
to
the
congress
show
that
we
can
expect
a
substantial
improvement
in
our
fiscal
position
over
the
next
few
years
as
the
cost
of
some
of
our
extraordinary
postwar
programs
declines
and
as
the
government
revenue
rises
as
a
result
of
growth
in
employment
and
national
income
to
further
improve
our
fiscal
outlook
we
should
make
some
changes
in
our
tax
system
which
will
reduce
present
inequities
stimulate
business
activity
and
yield
a
moderate
amount
of
additional
revenue
i
expect
to
transmit
specific
recommendations
to
the
congress
on
this
subject
at
a
very
early
date
the
fiscal
policy
i
am
recommending
is
the
quickest
and
safest
way
of
achieving
a
balanced
budget
as
we
move
forward
into
the
second
half
of
the
th
century
we
must
always
bear
in
mind
the
central
purpose
of
our
national
life
we
do
not
seek
material
prosperity
for
ourselves
because
we
love
luxury
we
do
not
aid
other
nations
because
we
wish
to
increase
our
power
we
have
not
devised
programs
for
the
security
and
wellbeing
of
our
people
because
we
are
afraid
or
unwilling
to
take
risks
this
is
not
the
meaning
of
our
past
history
or
our
present
course
we
work
for
a
better
life
for
all
so
that
all
men
may
put
to
good
use
the
great
gifts
with
which
they
have
been
endowed
by
their
creator
we
seek
to
establish
those
material
conditions
of
life
in
which
without
exception
men
may
live
in
dignity
perform
useful
work
serve
their
communities
and
worship
god
as
they
see
fit
these
may
seem
simple
goals
but
they
are
not
little
ones
they
are
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
all
the
empires
and
conquests
of
history
they
are
not
to
be
achieved
by
military
aggression
or
political
fanaticism
they
are
to
be
achieved
by
humbler
meansby
hard
work
by
a
spirit
of
selfrestraint
in
our
dealings
with
one
another
and
by
a
deep
devotion
to
the
principles
of
justice
and
equality
it
should
make
us
truly
thankful
as
we
look
back
to
the
beginnings
of
this
country
that
we
have
come
so
far
along
the
road
to
a
better
life
for
all
it
should
make
us
humble
to
think
as
we
look
ahead
how
much
farther
we
have
to
go
to
accomplish
at
home
and
abroad
the
objectives
that
were
set
out
for
us
at
the
founding
of
this
great
nation
as
we
approach
the
halfway
mark
of
the
th
century
we
should
ask
for
continued
strength
and
guidance
from
that
almighty
power
who
has
placed
before
us
such
great
opportunities
for
the
good
of
mankind
in
the
years
to
come

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
i
am
happy
to
report
to
this
st
congress
that
the
state
of
the
union
is
good
our
nation
is
better
able
than
ever
before
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
american
people
and
to
give
them
their
fair
chance
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
this
great
republic
is
foremost
among
the
nations
of
the
world
in
the
search
for
peace
during
the
last
years
our
people
have
been
creating
a
society
which
offers
new
opportunities
for
every
man
to
enjoy
his
share
of
the
good
things
of
life
in
this
society
we
are
conservative
about
the
values
and
principles
which
we
cherish
but
we
are
forwardlooking
in
protecting
those
values
and
principles
and
in
extending
their
benefits
we
have
rejected
the
discredited
theory
that
the
fortunes
of
the
nation
should
be
in
the
hands
of
a
privileged
few
we
have
abandoned
the
trickledown
concept
of
national
prosperity
instead
we
believe
that
our
economic
system
should
rest
on
a
democratic
foundation
and
that
wealth
should
be
created
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
recent
election
shows
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
in
favor
of
this
kind
of
society
and
want
to
go
on
improving
it
the
american
people
have
decided
that
poverty
is
just
as
wasteful
and
just
as
unnecessary
as
preventable
disease
we
have
pledged
our
common
resources
to
help
one
another
in
the
hazards
and
struggles
of
individual
life
we
believe
that
no
unfair
prejudice
or
artificial
distinction
should
bar
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
from
an
education
or
from
good
health
or
from
a
job
that
he
is
capable
of
performing
the
attainment
of
this
kind
of
society
demands
the
best
efforts
of
every
citizen
in
every
walk
of
life
and
it
imposes
increasing
responsibilities
on
the
government
the
government
must
work
with
industry
labor
and
the
farmers
in
keeping
our
economy
running
at
full
speed
the
government
must
see
that
every
american
has
a
chance
to
obtain
his
fair
share
of
our
increasing
abundance
these
responsibilities
go
hand
in
hand
we
cannot
maintain
prosperity
unless
we
have
a
fair
distribution
of
opportunity
and
a
widespread
consumption
of
the
products
of
our
factories
and
farms
our
government
has
undertaken
to
meet
these
responsibilities
we
have
made
tremendous
public
investments
in
highways
hydroelectric
power
projects
soil
conservation
and
reclamation
we
have
established
a
system
of
social
security
we
have
enacted
laws
protecting
the
rights
and
the
welfare
of
our
working
people
and
the
income
of
our
farmers
these
federal
policies
have
paid
for
themselves
many
times
over
they
have
strengthened
the
material
foundations
of
our
democratic
ideals
without
them
our
present
prosperity
would
be
impossible
reinforced
by
these
policies
our
private
enterprise
system
has
reached
new
heights
of
production
since
the
boom
year
of
while
our
population
has
increased
by
only
percent
our
agricultural
production
has
increased
by
percent
and
our
industrial
production
has
increased
by
percent
we
are
turning
out
far
more
goods
and
more
wealth
per
worker
than
we
have
ever
done
before
this
progress
has
confounded
the
gloomy
prophetsat
home
and
abroad
who
predicted
the
downfall
of
american
capitalism
the
people
of
the
united
states
going
their
own
way
confident
in
their
own
powers
have
achieved
the
greatest
prosperity
the
world
has
even
seen
but
great
as
our
progress
has
been
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
as
we
look
around
the
country
many
of
our
shortcomings
stand
out
in
bold
relief
we
are
suffering
from
excessively
high
prices
our
production
is
still
not
large
enough
to
satisfy
our
demands
our
minimum
wages
are
far
too
low
small
business
is
losing
ground
to
growing
monopoly
our
farmers
still
face
an
uncertain
future
and
too
many
of
them
lack
the
benefits
of
our
modern
civilization
some
of
our
natural
resources
are
still
being
wasted
we
are
acutely
short
of
electric
power
although
the
means
for
developing
such
power
are
abundant
five
million
families
are
still
living
in
slums
and
firetraps
three
million
families
share
their
homes
with
others
our
health
is
far
behind
the
progress
of
medical
science
proper
medical
care
is
so
expensive
that
it
is
out
of
the
reach
of
the
great
majority
of
our
citizens
our
schools
in
many
localities
are
utterly
inadequate
our
democratic
ideals
are
often
thwarted
by
prejudice
and
intolerance
each
of
these
shortcomings
is
also
an
opportunityan
opportunity
for
the
congress
and
the
president
to
work
for
the
good
of
the
people
our
first
great
opportunity
is
to
protect
our
economy
against
the
evils
of
boom
and
bust
this
objective
cannot
be
attained
by
government
alone
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
task
must
be
performed
by
individual
efforts
under
our
system
of
free
enterprise
we
can
keep
our
present
prosperity
and
increase
it
only
if
free
enterprise
and
free
government
work
together
to
that
end
we
cannot
afford
to
float
along
ceaselessly
on
a
postwar
boom
until
it
collapses
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
prepare
to
weather
a
recession
if
it
comes
instead
government
and
business
must
work
together
constantly
to
achieve
more
and
more
jobs
and
more
and
more
productionwhich
mean
more
and
more
prosperity
for
all
the
people
the
business
cycle
is
manmade
and
men
of
good
will
working
together
can
smooth
it
out
so
far
as
business
is
concerned
it
should
plan
for
steady
vigorous
expansionseeking
always
to
increase
its
output
lower
its
prices
and
avoid
the
vices
of
monopoly
and
restriction
so
long
as
business
does
this
it
will
be
contributing
to
continued
prosperity
and
it
will
have
the
help
and
encouragement
of
the
government
the
employment
act
of
pledges
the
government
to
use
all
its
resources
to
promote
maximum
employment
production
and
purchasing
power
this
means
that
the
government
is
firmly
committed
to
protect
business
and
the
people
against
the
dangers
of
recession
and
against
the
evils
of
inflation
this
means
that
the
government
must
adapt
its
plans
and
policies
to
meet
changing
circumstances
at
the
present
time
our
prosperity
is
threatened
by
inflationary
pressures
at
a
number
of
critical
points
in
our
economy
and
the
government
must
be
in
a
position
to
take
effective
action
at
these
danger
spots
to
that
end
i
recommend
that
the
congress
enact
legislation
for
the
following
purposes
first
to
continue
the
power
to
control
consumer
credit
and
enlarge
the
power
to
control
bank
credit
second
to
grant
authority
to
regulate
speculation
on
the
commodity
exchanges
third
to
continue
export
control
authority
and
to
provide
adequate
machinery
for
its
enforcement
fourth
to
continue
the
priorities
and
allocation
authority
in
the
field
of
transportation
fifth
to
authorize
priorities
and
allocations
for
key
materials
in
short
supply
sixth
to
extend
and
strengthen
rent
control
seventh
to
provide
standby
authority
to
impose
price
ceilings
for
scarce
commodities
which
basically
affect
essential
industrial
production
or
the
cost
of
living
and
to
limit
unjustified
wage
adjustments
which
would
force
a
break
in
an
established
price
ceiling
eighth
to
authorize
an
immediate
study
of
the
adequacy
of
production
facilities
for
materials
in
critically
short
supply
such
as
steel
and
if
found
necessary
to
authorize
government
loans
for
the
expansion
of
production
facilities
to
relieve
such
shortages
and
to
authorize
the
construction
of
such
facilities
directly
if
action
by
private
industry
fails
to
meet
our
needs
the
economic
report
which
i
shall
submit
to
the
congress
shortly
will
discuss
in
detail
the
economic
background
for
these
recommendations
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
maintaining
prosperity
is
the
governments
fiscal
policy
at
this
time
it
is
essential
not
only
that
the
federal
budget
be
balanced
but
also
that
there
be
a
substantial
surplus
to
reduce
inflationary
pressures
and
to
permit
a
sizable
reduction
in
the
national
debt
which
now
stands
at
billion
i
recommend
therefore
that
the
congress
enact
new
tax
legislation
to
bring
in
an
additional
billion
of
government
revenue
this
should
come
principally
from
additional
corporate
taxes
a
portion
should
come
from
revised
estate
and
gift
taxes
consideration
should
be
given
to
raising
personal
income
rates
in
the
middle
and
upper
brackets
if
we
want
to
keep
our
economy
running
in
high
gear
we
must
be
sure
that
every
group
has
the
incentive
to
make
its
full
contribution
to
the
national
welfare
at
present
the
working
men
and
women
of
the
nation
are
unfairly
discriminated
against
by
a
statute
that
abridges
their
rights
curtails
their
constructive
efforts
and
hampers
our
system
of
free
collective
bargaining
that
statute
is
the
labormanagement
relations
act
of
sometimes
called
the
tafthartley
act
that
act
should
be
repealed
the
wagner
act
should
be
reenacted
however
certain
improvements
which
i
recommended
to
the
congress
years
ago
are
needed
jurisdictional
strikes
and
unjustified
secondary
boycotts
should
be
prohibited
the
use
of
economic
force
to
decide
issues
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
of
existing
contracts
should
be
prevented
without
endangering
our
democratic
freedoms
means
should
be
provided
for
setting
up
machinery
for
preventing
strikes
in
vital
industries
which
affect
the
public
interest
the
department
of
labor
should
be
rebuilt
and
strengthened
and
those
units
properly
belonging
within
that
department
should
be
placed
in
it
the
health
of
our
economy
and
its
maintenance
at
high
levels
further
require
that
the
minimum
wage
fixed
by
law
should
be
raised
to
at
least
cents
an
hour
if
our
free
enterprise
economy
is
to
be
strong
and
healthy
we
must
reinvigorate
the
forces
of
competition
we
must
assure
small
business
the
freedom
and
opportunity
to
grow
and
prosper
to
this
purpose
we
should
strengthen
our
antitrust
laws
by
closing
those
loopholes
that
permit
monopolistic
mergers
and
consolidations
our
national
farm
program
should
be
improvednot
only
in
the
interest
of
the
farmers
but
for
the
lasting
prosperity
of
the
whole
nation
our
goals
should
be
abundant
farm
production
and
parity
income
for
agriculture
standards
of
living
on
the
farm
should
be
just
a
s
good
as
anywhere
else
in
the
country
farm
price
supports
are
an
essential
part
of
our
program
to
achieve
these
ends
price
supports
should
be
used
to
prevent
farm
price
declines
which
are
out
of
line
with
general
price
levels
to
facilitate
adjustments
in
production
to
consumer
demands
and
to
promote
good
land
use
our
price
support
legislation
must
be
adapted
to
these
objectives
the
authority
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation
to
provide
adequate
storage
space
for
crops
should
be
restored
our
program
for
farm
prosperity
should
also
seek
to
expand
the
domestic
market
for
agricultural
products
particularly
among
lowincome
groups
and
to
increase
and
stabilize
foreign
markets
we
should
give
special
attention
to
extending
modern
conveniences
and
services
to
our
farms
rural
electrification
should
be
pushed
forward
and
in
considering
legislation
relating
to
housing
education
health
and
social
security
special
attention
should
be
given
to
rural
problems
our
growing
population
and
the
expansion
of
our
economy
depend
upon
the
wise
management
of
our
land
water
forest
and
mineral
wealth
in
our
present
dynamic
economy
the
task
of
conservation
is
not
to
lockup
our
resources
but
to
develop
and
improve
them
failure
today
to
make
the
investments
which
are
necessary
to
support
our
progress
in
the
future
would
be
false
economy
we
must
push
forward
the
development
of
our
rivers
for
power
irrigation
navigation
and
flood
control
we
should
apply
the
lessons
of
our
tennessee
valley
experience
to
our
other
great
river
basins
i
again
recommend
action
be
taken
by
the
congress
to
approve
the
st
lawrence
seaway
and
power
project
this
is
about
the
fifth
time
i
have
recommended
it
we
must
adopt
a
program
for
the
planned
use
of
the
petroleum
reserves
under
the
sea
which
areand
must
remainvested
in
the
federal
government
we
must
extend
our
programs
of
soil
conservation
we
must
place
our
forests
on
a
sustained
yield
basis
and
encourage
the
development
of
new
sources
of
vital
minerals
in
all
this
we
must
make
sure
that
the
benefits
of
these
public
undertakings
are
directly
available
to
the
people
public
power
should
be
carried
to
consuming
areas
by
public
transmission
lines
where
necessary
to
provide
electricity
at
the
lowest
possible
rates
irrigation
waters
should
serve
family
farms
and
not
land
speculators
the
government
has
still
other
opportunitiesto
help
raise
the
standard
of
living
of
our
citizens
these
opportunities
lie
in
the
fields
of
social
security
health
education
housing
and
civil
rights
the
present
coverage
of
the
social
security
laws
is
altogether
inadequate
the
benefit
payments
are
too
low
onethird
of
our
workers
are
not
covered
those
who
receive
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
benefits
receive
an
average
payment
of
only
a
month
many
others
who
cannot
work
because
they
are
physically
disabled
are
left
to
the
mercy
of
charity
we
should
expand
our
social
security
program
both
as
to
the
size
of
the
benefits
and
the
extent
of
coverage
against
the
economic
hazards
due
to
unemployment
old
age
sickness
and
disability
we
must
spare
no
effort
to
raise
the
general
level
of
health
in
this
country
in
a
nation
as
rich
as
ours
it
is
a
shocking
fact
that
tens
of
millions
lack
adequate
medical
care
we
are
short
of
doctors
hospitals
nurses
we
must
remedy
these
shortages
moreover
we
needand
we
must
have
without
further
delaya
system
of
prepaid
medical
insurance
which
will
enable
every
american
to
afford
good
medical
care
it
is
equally
shocking
that
millions
of
our
children
are
not
receiving
a
good
education
millions
of
them
are
in
overcrowded
obsolete
buildings
we
are
short
of
teachers
because
teachers
salaries
are
too
low
to
attract
new
teachers
or
to
hold
the
ones
we
have
all
these
school
problems
will
become
much
more
acute
as
a
result
of
the
tremendous
increase
in
the
enrollment
in
our
elementary
schools
in
the
next
few
years
i
cannot
repeat
too
strongly
my
desire
for
prompt
federal
financial
aid
to
the
states
to
help
them
operate
and
maintain
their
school
systems
the
governmental
agency
which
now
administers
the
programs
of
health
education
and
social
security
should
be
given
full
departmental
status
the
housing
shortage
continues
to
be
acute
as
an
immediate
step
the
congress
should
enact
the
provisions
for
lowrent
public
housing
slum
clearance
farm
housing
and
housing
research
which
i
have
repeatedly
recommended
the
number
of
lowrent
public
housing
units
provided
for
in
the
legislation
should
be
increased
to
million
units
in
the
next
years
even
this
number
of
units
will
not
begin
to
meet
our
need
for
new
housing
most
of
the
houses
we
need
will
have
to
be
built
by
private
enterprise
without
public
subsidy
by
producing
too
few
rental
units
and
too
large
a
proportion
of
highpriced
houses
the
building
industry
is
rapidly
pricing
itself
out
of
the
market
building
costs
must
be
lowered
the
government
is
now
engaged
in
a
campaign
to
induce
all
segments
of
the
building
industry
to
concentrate
on
the
production
of
lower
priced
housing
additional
legislation
to
encourage
such
housing
will
be
submitted
the
authority
which
i
have
requested
to
allocate
materials
in
short
supply
and
to
impose
price
ceilings
on
such
materials
could
be
used
if
found
necessary
to
channel
more
materials
into
homes
large
enough
for
family
life
at
prices
which
wage
earners
can
afford
the
driving
force
behind
our
progress
is
our
faith
in
our
democratic
institutions
that
faith
is
embodied
in
the
promise
of
equal
rights
and
equal
opportunities
which
the
founders
of
our
republic
proclaimed
to
their
countrymen
and
to
the
whole
world
the
fulfillment
of
this
promise
is
among
the
highest
purposes
of
government
the
civil
rights
proposals
i
made
to
the
th
congress
i
now
repeat
to
the
st
congress
they
should
be
enacted
in
order
that
the
federal
government
may
assume
the
leadership
and
discharge
the
obligations
dearly
placed
upon
it
by
the
constitution
i
stand
squarely
behind
those
proposals
our
domestic
programs
are
the
foundation
of
our
foreign
policy
the
world
today
looks
to
us
for
leadership
because
we
have
so
largely
realized
within
our
borders
those
benefits
of
democratic
government
for
which
most
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
are
yearning
we
are
following
a
foreign
policy
which
is
the
outward
expression
of
the
democratic
faith
we
profess
we
are
doing
what
we
can
to
encourage
free
states
and
free
peoples
throughout
the
world
to
aid
the
suffering
and
afflicted
in
foreign
lands
and
to
strengthen
democratic
nations
against
aggression
the
heart
of
our
foreign
policy
is
peace
we
are
supporting
a
world
organization
to
keep
peace
and
a
world
economic
policy
to
create
prosperity
for
mankind
our
guiding
star
is
the
principle
of
international
cooperation
to
this
concept
we
have
made
a
national
commitment
as
profound
as
anything
in
history
to
it
we
have
pledged
our
resources
and
our
honor
until
a
system
of
world
security
is
established
upon
which
we
can
safely
rely
we
cannot
escape
the
burden
of
creating
and
maintaining
armed
forces
sufficient
to
deter
aggression
we
have
made
great
progress
in
the
last
year
in
the
effective
organization
of
our
armed
forces
but
further
improvements
in
our
national
security
legislation
are
necessary
universal
training
is
essential
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
during
the
course
of
this
session
i
shall
have
occasion
to
ask
the
congress
to
consider
several
measures
in
the
field
of
foreign
policy
at
this
time
i
recommend
that
we
restore
the
reciprocal
trade
agreements
act
to
full
effectiveness
and
extend
it
for
years
we
should
also
open
our
doors
to
displaced
persons
without
unfair
discrimination
it
should
be
clear
by
now
to
all
citizens
that
we
are
not
seeking
to
freeze
the
status
quo
we
have
no
intention
of
preserving
the
injustices
of
the
past
we
welcome
the
constructive
efforts
being
made
by
many
nations
to
achieve
a
better
life
for
their
citizens
in
the
european
recovery
program
in
our
goodneighbor
policy
and
in
the
united
nations
we
have
begun
to
batter
down
those
national
walls
which
block
the
economic
growth
and
the
social
advancement
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
we
believe
that
if
we
hold
resolutely
to
this
course
the
principle
of
international
cooperation
will
eventually
command
the
approval
even
of
those
nations
which
are
now
seeking
to
weaken
or
subvert
it
we
stand
at
the
opening
of
an
era
which
can
mean
either
great
achievement
or
terrible
catastrophe
for
ourselves
and
for
all
mankind
the
strength
of
our
nation
must
continue
to
be
used
in
the
interest
of
all
our
people
rather
than
a
privileged
few
it
must
continue
to
be
used
unselfishly
in
the
struggle
for
world
peace
and
the
betterment
of
mankind
the
world
over
this
is
the
task
before
us
it
is
not
an
easy
one
it
has
many
complications
and
there
will
be
strong
opposition
from
selfish
interests
i
hope
for
cooperation
from
farmers
from
labor
and
from
business
every
segment
of
our
population
and
every
individual
has
a
right
to
expect
from
our
government
a
fair
deal
in
when
i
came
down
before
the
congress
for
the
first
time
on
april
i
quoted
to
you
king
solomons
prayer
that
he
wanted
wisdom
and
the
ability
to
govern
his
people
as
they
should
be
governed
i
explained
to
you
at
that
time
that
the
task
before
me
was
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
the
complete
cooperation
of
the
congress
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
well
now
we
are
taking
a
new
start
with
the
same
situation
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
your
president
have
the
complete
cooperation
of
the
congress
to
carry
out
the
great
work
that
must
be
done
to
keep
the
peace
in
this
world
and
to
keep
this
country
prosperous
the
people
of
this
great
country
have
a
right
to
expect
that
the
congress
and
the
president
will
work
in
closest
cooperation
with
one
objectivethe
welfare
of
the
people
of
this
nation
as
a
whole
in
the
months
ahead
i
know
that
i
shall
be
able
to
cooperate
with
this
congress
now
i
am
confident
that
the
divine
power
which
has
guided
us
to
this
time
of
fateful
responsibility
and

glorious
opportunity
will
not
desert
us
now
with
that
help
from
almighty
god
which
we
have
humbly
acknowledged
at
every
turning
point
in
our
national
life
we
shall
be
able
to
perform
the
great
tasks
which
he
now
sets
before
us

mr
president
mr
speaker
and
members
of
the
th
congress
we
are
here
today
to
consider
the
state
of
the
union
on
this
occasion
above
all
others
the
congress
and
the
president
should
concentrate
their
attention
not
upon
party
but
upon
the
country
not
upon
things
which
divide
us
but
upon
those
which
bind
us
togetherthe
enduring
principles
of
our
american
system
and
our
common
aspirations
for
the
future
welfare
and
security
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
united
states
has
become
great
because
p
we
as
a
people
have
been
able
to
work
together
for
great
objectives
even
while
differing
about
details
the
elements
of
our
strength
are
many
they
include
our
democratic
government
our
economic
system
our
great
natural
resources
but
these
are
only
partial
explanations
the
basic
source
of
our
strength
is
spiritual
for
we
are
a
people
with
a
faith
we
believe
in
the
dignity
of
man
we
believe
that
he
was
created
in
the
image
of
the
father
of
us
all
we
do
not
believe
that
men
exist
merely
to
strengthen
the
state
or
to
be
cogs
in
the
economic
machine
we
do
believe
that
governments
are
created
to
serve
the
people
and
that
economic
systems
exist
to
minister
to
their
wants
we
have
a
profound
devotion
to
the
welfare
and
rights
of
the
individual
as
a
human
being
the
faith
of
our
people
has
particular
meaning
at
this
time
in
history
because
of
the
unsettled
and
changing
state
of
the
world
the
victims
of
war
in
many
lands
are
striving
to
rebuild
their
lives
and
are
seeking
assurance
that
the
tragedy
of
war
will
not
occur
again
throughout
the
world
new
ideas
are
challenging
the
old
men
of
all
nations
are
reexamining
the
beliefs
by
which
they
live
great
scientific
and
industrial
changes
have
released
new
forces
which
will
affect
the
future
course
of
civilization
the
state
of
our
union
reflects
the
changing
nature
of
the
modern
world
on
all
sides
there
is
heartening
evidence
of
great
energyof
capacity
for
economic
developmentand
even
more
important
capacity
for
spiritual
growth
but
accompanying
this
great
activity
there
are
equally
great
questions
great
anxieties
and
great
aspirations
they
represent
the
concern
of
an
enlightened
people
that
conditions
should
be
so
arranged
as
to
make
life
more
worthwhile
we
must
devote
ourselves
to
finding
answers
to
these
anxieties
and
aspirations
we
seek
answers
which
will
embody
the
moral
and
spiritual
elements
of
tolerance
unselfishness
and
brotherhood
upon
which
true
freedom
and
opportunity
must
rest
as
we
examine
the
state
of
our
union
today
we
can
benefit
from
viewing
it
on
a
basis
of
the
accomplishments
of
the
last
decade
and
of
our
goals
for
the
next
how
far
have
we
come
during
the
last
years
and
how
far
can
we
go
in
the
next
it
was
years
ago
that
the
determination
of
dictators
to
wage
war
upon
mankind
became
apparent
the
years
that
followed
brought
untold
death
and
destruction
we
shared
in
the
human
suffering
of
the
war
but
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
escape
most
of
wars
destruction
we
were
able
through
these
years
to
expand
the
productive
strength
of
our
farms
and
factories
more
important
however
is
the
fact
that
these
years
brought
us
new
courage
new
confidence
in
the
ideals
of
our
free
democracy
our
deep
belief
in
freedom
and
justice
was
reinforced
in
the
crucible
of
war
on
the
foundations
of
our
greatly
strengthened
economy
and
our
renewed
confidence
in
democratic
values
we
can
continue
to
move
forward
there
are
some
who
look
with
fear
and
distrust
upon
planning
for
the
future
yet
our
great
national
achievements
have
been
attained
by
those
with
vision
our
union
was
formed
our
frontiers
were
pushed
back
and
our
great
industries
were
built
by
men
who
looked
ahead
i
propose
that
we
look
ahead
today
toward
those
goals
for
the
future
which
have
the
greatest
bearing
upon
the
foundations
of
our
democracy
and
the
happiness
of
our
people
i
do
so
confident
in
the
thought
that
with
clear
objectives
and
with
firm
determination
we
can
in
the
next
years
build
upon
the
p
accomplishments
of
the
past
decade
to
achieve
a
glorious
future
year
by
year
beginning
now
we
must
make
a
substantial
part
of
this
progress
our
first
goal
is
to
secure
fully
the
essential
human
rights
of
our
citizens
the
united
states
has
always
had
a
deep
concern
for
human
rights
religious
freedom
free
speech
and
freedom
of
thought
are
cherished
realities
in
our
land
any
denial
of
human
rights
is
a
denial
of
the
basic
beliefs
of
democracy
and
of
our
regard
for
the
worth
of
each
individual
today
however
some
of
our
citizens
are
still
denied
equal
opportunity
for
education
for
jobs
and
economic
advancement
and
for
the
expression
of
their
views
at
the
polls
most
serious
of
all
some
are
denied
equal
protection
under
laws
whether
discrimination
is
based
on
race
or
creed
or
color
or
land
of
origin
it
is
utterly
contrary
to
american
ideals
of
democracy
the
recent
report
of
the
presidents
committee
on
civil
rights
points
the
way
to
corrective
action
by
the
federal
government
and
by
state
and
local
governments
because
of
the
need
for
effective
federal
action
i
shall
send
a
special
message
to
the
congress
on
this
important
subject
we
should
also
consider
our
obligation
to
assure
the
fullest
possible
measure
of
civil
rights
to
the
people
of
our
territories
and
possessions
i
believe
that
the
time
has
come
for
alaska
and
hawaii
to
be
admitted
to
the
union
as
states
our
second
goal
is
to
protect
and
develop
our
human
resources
the
safeguarding
of
the
rights
of
our
citizens
must
be
accompanied
by
an
equal
regard
for
their
opportunities
for
development
and
their
protection
from
economic
insecurity
in
this
nation
the
ideals
of
freedom
and
equality
can
be
given
specific
meaning
in
terms
of
health
education
social
security
and
housing
over
the
past
years
we
have
erected
a
sound
framework
of
social
security
legislation
many
millions
of
our
citizens
are
now
protected
against
the
loss
of
income
which
can
come
with
unemployment
old
age
or
the
death
of
wage
earners
yet
our
system
has
gaps
and
inconsistencies
it
is
only
half
finished
we
should
now
extend
unemployment
compensation
old
age
benefits
and
survivors
benefits
to
millions
who
are
not
now
protected
we
should
also
raise
the
level
of
benefits
the
greatest
gap
in
our
social
security
structure
is
the
lack
of
adequate
provision
for
the
nations
health
we
are
rightly
proud
of
the
high
standards
of
medical
care
we
know
how
to
provide
in
the
united
states
the
fact
is
however
that
most
of
our
people
cannot
afford
to
pay
for
the
care
they
need
i
have
often
and
strongly
urged
that
this
condition
demands
a
national
health
program
the
heart
of
the
program
must
be
a
national
system
of
payment
for
medical
care
based
on
welltried
insurance
principles
this
great
nation
cannot
afford
to
allow
its
citizens
to
suffer
needlessly
from
the
lack
of
proper
medical
care
our
ultimate
aim
must
be
a
comprehensive
insurance
system
to
protect
all
our
people
equally
against
insecurity
and
ill
health
another
fundamental
aim
of
our
democracy
is
to
provide
an
adequate
education
for
every
person
our
educational
systems
face
a
financial
crisis
it
is
deplorable
that
in
a
nation
as
rich
as
ours
there
are
millions
of
children
who
do
not
have
adequate
schoolhouses
or
enough
teachers
for
a
good
elementary
or
secondary
education
if
there
are
educational
inadequacies
in
any
state
the
whole
nation
suffers
the
federal
government
has
a
responsibility
for
providing
financial
aid
to
meet
this
crisis
in
addition
we
must
make
possible
greater
equality
of
opportunity
to
all
our
citizens
for
education
only
by
so
doing
can
we
insure
that
our
citizens
will
be
capable
of
understanding
and
sharing
the
responsibilities
of
democracy
the
governments
programs
for
health
education
and
security
are
of
such
great
importance
to
our
democracy
that
we
should
now
establish
an
executive
department
for
their
administration
health
and
education
have
their
beginning
in
the
home
no
matter
what
our
hospitals
or
schools
are
like
the
youth
of
our
nation
are
handicapped
when
millions
of
them
live
in
city
slums
and
country
shacks
within
the
next
decade
we
must
see
that
every
american
family
has
a
decent
home
as
an
immediate
step
we
need
the
longrange
housing
program
which
i
have
recommended
on
many
occasions
to
this
congress
this
should
include
financial
aids
designed
to
yield
more
housing
at
lower
prices
it
should
provide
public
housing
for
lowincome
families
and
vigorous
development
of
new
techniques
to
lower
the
cost
of
building
until
we
can
overcome
the
present
drastic
housing
shortage
we
must
extend
and
strengthen
rent
control
we
have
had
and
shall
continue
to
have
a
special
interest
in
the
welfare
of
our
veterans
over
million
men
and
women
who
served
in
the
armed
forces
in
world
war
ii
have
now
returned
to
civilian
life
over
million
veterans
are
being
helped
through
school
millions
have
been
aided
while
finding
jobs
and
have
been
helped
in
buying
homes
in
obtaining
medical
care
and
in
adjusting
themselves
to
physical
handicaps
all
but
a
very
few
veterans
have
successfully
made
the
transition
from
military
life
to
their
home
communities
the
success
of
our
veterans
program
is
proved
by
this
fact
this
nation
is
proud
of
the
eagerness
shown
by
our
veterans
to
become
selfreliant
and
selfsupporting
citizens
our
third
goal
is
to
conserve
and
use
our
natural
resources
so
that
they
can
contribute
most
effectively
to
the
welfare
of
our
people
the
resources
given
by
nature
to
this
country
are
rich
and
extensive
the
material
foundations
of
our
growth
and
economic
development
are
the
bounty
of
our
fields
the
wealth
of
our
mines
and
forests
and
the
energy
of
our
waters
as
a
nation
we
are
coming
to
appreciate
more
each
day
the
dose
relationship
between
the
conservation
of
these
resources
and
the
preservation
of
our
national
strength
we
are
doing
far
less
than
we
know
how
to
do
to
make
use
of
our
resources
without
destroying
them
both
the
public
and
private
use
of
these
resources
must
have
the
primary
objective
of
maintaining
and
increasing
these
basic
supports
for
an
expanding
future

we
must
continue
to
take
specific
steps
toward
this
goal
we
must
vigorously
defend
our
natural
wealth
against
those
who
would
misuse
it
for
selfish
gain
we
need
accurate
and
comprehensive
knowledge
of
our
mineral
resources
and
must
intensify
our
efforts
to
develop
new
supplies
and
to
acquire
stockpiles
of
scarce
materials
we
need
to
protect
and
restore
our
landpublic
and
privatethrough
combating
erosion
and
rebuilding
the
fertility
of
the
soil
we
must
expand
our
reclamation
program
to
bring
millions
of
acres
of
arid
land
into
production
and
to
improve
water
supplies
for
additional
millions
of
acres
this
will
provide
new
opportunities
for
veterans
and
others
particularly
in
the
west
and
aid
in
providing
a
rising
living
standard
for
a
growing
population
we
must
protect
and
restore
our
forests
by
sustainedyield
forestry
and
by
planting
p
new
trees
in
areas
now
slashed
and
barren
we
must
continue
to
erect
multiplepurpose
dams
on
our
great
riversnot
only
to
reclaim
land
but
also
to
prevent
floods
to
extend
our
inland
waterways
and
to
provide
hydroelectric
power
this
public
power
must
not
be
monopolized
for
private
gain
only
through
wellestablished
policies
of
transmitting
power
directly
to
its
market
and
thus
encouraging
widespread
use
at
low
rates
can
the
federal
government
assure
the
people
of
their
full
share
of
its
benefits
additional
powerpublic
and
privateis
needed
to
raise
the
ceilings
now
imposed
by
power
shortages
on
industrial
and
agricultural
development
we
should
achieve
the
wise
use
of
resources
through
the
integrated
development
of
our
great
river
basins
we
can
learn
much
from
our
tennessee
valley
experience
we
should
no
longer
delay
in
applying
the
lessons
of
that
vast
undertaking
to
our
other
great
river
basins
our
fourth
goal
is
to
lift
the
standard
of
living
for
all
our
people
by
strengthening
our
economic
system
and
sharing
more
broadly
among
our
people
the
goods
we
produce
the
amazing
economic
progress
of
the
past
years
points
the
way
for
the
next
today
million
more
people
have
jobs
than
in
our
yearly
output
of
goods
and
services
has
increased
by
twothirds
the
average
income
of
our
people
measured
in
dollars
of
equal
purchasing
power
has
increasedafter
taxesby
more
than
percent
in
no
other
years
have
farmers
businessmen
and
wage
earners
made
such
great
gains
we
may
not
be
able
to
expand
as
rapidly
in
the
next
decade
as
in
the
last
because
we
are
now
starting
from
full
employment
and
very
high
production
but
we
can
increase
our
annual
output
by
at
least
onethird
above
the
present
level
we
can
lift
our
standard
of
living
to
nearly
double
what
it
was
years
ago
if
we
distribute
these
gains
properly
we
can
go
far
toward
stamping
out
poverty
in
our
generation
to
do
this
agriculture
business
and
labor
must
move
forward
together
permanent
farm
prosperity
and
agricultural
abundance
will
be
achieved
only
as
our
whole
economy
grows
and
prospers
the
farmer
can
sell
more
food
at
good
prices
when
the
incomes
of
wage
earners
are
high
and
when
there
is
full
employment
adequate
diets
for
every
american
family
and
the
needs
of
our
industries
at
full
production
will
absorb
a
farm
output
well
above
our
present
levels
although
the
average
farmer
is
now
better
off
than
ever
before
farm
families
as
a
whole
have
only
begun
to
catch
up
with
the
standards
of
living
enjoyed
in
the
cities
in
the
average
income
of
farm
people
was
contrasted
with
an
average
income
of
for
nonfarm
people
within
the
next
decade
we
should
eliminate
elements
of
inequality
in
these
living
standards
to
this
end
our
farm
program
should
enable
the
farmer
to
market
his
varied
crops
at
fair
price
levels
and
to
improve
his
standard
of
living
we
need
to
continue
price
supports
for
major
farm
commodities
on
a
basis
which
will
afford
reasonable
protection
against
fluctuations
in
the
levels
of
production
and
demand
the
present
price
support
program
must
be
reexamined
and
modernized
crop
insurance
should
be
strengthened
and
its
benefits
extended
in
order
to
protect
the
farmer
against
the
special
hazards
to
which
he
is
subject
we
also
need
to
improve
the
means
for
getting
farm
products
into
markets
and
into
the
hands
of
consumers
cooperatives
which
p
directly
or
indirectly
serve
this
purpose
must
be
encouragednot
discouraged
the
school
lunch
program
should
be
continued
and
adequately
financed
we
need
to
go
forward
with
the
rural
electrification
program
to
bring
the
benefits
of
electricity
to
all
our
farm
population
we
can
and
must
aid
and
encourage
farmers
to
conserve
their
soil
resources
and
restore
the
fertility
of
the
land
that
has
suffered
from
neglect
or
unwise
use
all
these
are
practical
measures
upon
which
we
should
act
immediately
to
enable
agriculture
to
make
its
full
contribution
to
our
prosperity
we
must
also
strengthen
our
economic
system
within
the
next
decade
by
enlarging
our
industrial
capacity
within
the
framework
of
our
free
enterprise
system
we
are
today
far
short
of
the
industrial
capacity
we
need
for
a
growing
future
at
least
billion
should
be
invested
by
industry
to
improve
and
expand
our
productive
facilities
over
the
next
few
years
but
this
is
only
the
beginning
the
industrial
application
of
atomic
energy
and
other
scientific
advances
will
constantly
open
up
further
opportunities
for
expansion
farm
prosperity
and
high
employment
will
call
for
an
immensely
increased
output
of
goods
and
services
growth
and
vitality
in
our
economy
depend
on
vigorous
private
enterprise
free
competition
is
the
key
to
industrial
development
full
production
and
employment
fair
prices
and
an
ever
improving
standard
of
living
competition
is
seriously
limited
today
in
many
industries
by
the
concentration
of
economic
power
and
other
elements
of
monopoly
the
appropriation
of
sufficient
funds
to
permit
proper
enforcement
of
the
present
antitrust
laws
is
essential
beyond
that
we
should
go
on
to
strengthen
our
legislation
to
protect
competition
another
basic
element
of
a
strong
economic
system
is
the
wellbeing
of
the
wage
earners
we
have
learned
that
the
wellbeing
of
workers
depends
on
high
production
and
consequent
high
employment
we
have
learned
equally
well
that
the
welfare
of
industry
and
agriculture
depends
on
high
incomes
for
our
workers
the
government
has
wisely
chosen
to
set
a
floor
under
wages
but
our
cent
minimum
wage
is
inadequate
and
obsolete
i
recommend
the
lifting
of
the
minimum
wage
to
cents
an
hour
in
general
however
we
must
continue
to
rely
on
our
sound
system
of
collective
bargaining
to
set
wage
scales
workers
incomes
should
increase
at
a
rate
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
sound
price
profit
and
wage
relationships
and
with
increase
of
productivity
the
governments
part
in
labormanagement
relations
is
now
largely
controlled
by
the
terms
of
the
labormanagement
relations
act
of
i
made
my
attitude
clear
on
this
act
in
my
veto
message
to
the
congress
last
june
nothing
has
occurred
since
to
change
my
opinion
of
this
law
as
long
as
it
remains
the
law
of
the
land
however
i
shall
carry
out
my
constitutional
duty
and
administer
it
as
we
look
ahead
we
can
understand
the
crucial
importance
of
restraint
and
wisdom
in
arriving
at
new
labormanagement
contracts
work
stoppages
would
result
in
a
loss
of
productiona
loss
which
could
bring
higher
prices
for
our
citizens
and
could
also
deny
the
necessities
of
life
to
the
hardpressed
peoples
of
other
lands
it
is
my
sincere
hope
that
the
representatives
of
labor
and
of
industry
will
bear
in
mind
that
the
nation
as
a
whole
has
a
vital
stake
in
the
success
of
their
bargaining
efforts
if
we
surmount
our
current
economic
difficulties
we
can
move
ahead
to
a
great
increase
p
in
our
national
income
which
will
enable
all
our
people
to
enjoy
richer
and
fuller
lives
all
of
us
must
advance
together
onefifth
of
our
families
now
have
average
annual
incomes
of
less
than
we
must
see
that
our
gains
in
national
income
are
made
more
largely
available
to
those
with
low
incomes
whose
need
is
greatest
this
will
benefit
us
all
through
providing
a
stable
foundation
of
buying
power
to
maintain
prosperity
business
labor
agriculture
and
government
working
together
must
develop
the
policies
which
will
make
possible
the
realization
of
the
full
benefits
of
our
economic
system
our
fifth
goal
is
to
achieve
world
peace
based
on
principles
of
freedom
and
justice
and
the
equality
of
all
nations
twice
within
our
generation
world
wars
have
taught
us
that
we
cannot
isolate
ourselves
from
the
rest
of
the
world
we
have
learned
that
the
loss
of
freedom
in
any
area
of
the
world
means
a
loss
of
freedom
to
ourselvesthat
the
loss
of
independence
by
any
nation
adds
directly
to
the
insecurity
of
the
united
states
and
all
free
nations
we
have
learned
that
a
healthy
world
economy
is
essential
to
world
peacethat
economic
distress
is
a
disease
whose
evil
effects
spread
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
afflicted
nation
for
these
reasons
the
united
states
is
vigorously
following
policies
designed
to
achieve
a
peaceful
and
prosperous
world
we
are
giving
and
will
continue
to
give
our
full
support
to
the
united
nations
while
that
organization
has
encountered
unforeseen
and
unwelcome
difficulties
i
am
confident
of
its
ultimate
success
we
are
also
devoting
our
efforts
toward
world
economic
recovery
and
the
revival
of
world
trade
these
actions
are
closely
related
and
mutually
supporting
we
believe
that
the
united
states
can
be
an
effective
force
for
world
peace
only
if
it
is
strong
we
look
forward
to
the
day
when
nations
will
decrease
their
armaments
yet
so
long
as
there
remains
serious
opposition
to
the
ideals
of
a
peaceful
world
we
must
maintain
strong
armed
forces
the
passage
of
the
national
security
act
by
the
congress
at
its
last
session
was
a
notable
step
in
providing
for
the
security
of
this
country
a
further
step
which
i
consider
of
even
greater
importance
is
the
early
provision
for
universal
training
there
are
many
elements
in
a
balanced
national
security
program
all
interrelated
and
necessary
but
universal
training
should
be
the
foundation
for
them
all
a
favorable

decision
by
the
congress
at
an
early
date
is
of
world
importance
i
am
convinced
that
such
action
is
vital
to
the
security
of
this
nation
and
to
the
maintenance
of
its
leadership
the
united
states
is
engaged
today
in
many
international
activities
directed
toward
the
creation
of
lasting
peaceful
relationships
among
nations
we
have
been
giving
substantial
aid
to
greece
and
turkey
to
assist
those
nations
in
preserving
their
integrity
against
foreign
pressures
had
it
not
been
for
our
aid
their
situation
today
might
well
be
radically
different
the
continued
integrity
of
those
countries
will
have
a
powerful
effect
upon
other
nations
in
the
middle
east
and
in
europe
struggling
to
maintain
their
independence
while
they
repair
the
damages
of
war
the
united
states
has
special
responsibilities
with
respect
to
the
countries
in
which
we
have
occupation
forces
germany
austria
japan
and
korea
our
efforts
to
reach
agreements
on
peace
settlements
for
these
countries
have
so
far
been
blocked
but
we
p
shall
continue
to
exert
our
utmost
efforts
to
obtain
satisfactory
settlements
for
each
of
these
nations
many
thousands
of
displaced
persons
still
living
in
camps
overseas
should
be
allowed
entry
into
the
united
states
i
again
urge
the
congress
to
pass
suitable
legislation
at
once
so
that
this
nation
may
do
its
share
in
caring
for
the
homeless
and
suffering
refugees
of
all
faiths
i
believe
that
the
admission
of
these
persons
will
add
to
the
strength
and
energy
of
this
nation
we
are
moving
toward
our
goal
of
world
peace
in
many
ways
but
the
most
important
efforts
which
we
are
now
making
are
those
which
support
world
economic
reconstruction
we
are
seeking
to
restore
the
world
trading
system
which
was
shattered
by
the
war
and
to
remedy
the
economic
paralysis
which
grips
many
countries
to
restore
world
trade
we
have
recently
taken
the
lead
in
bringing
about
the
greatest
reduction
of
world
tariffs
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
the
extension
of
the
provisions
of
the
reciprocal
trade
agreements
act
which
made
this
achievement
possible
is
of
extreme
importance
we
must
also
go
on
to
support
the
international
trade
organization
through
which
we
hope
to
obtain
worldwide
agreement
on
a
code
of
fair
conduct
in
international
trade
our
present
major
effort
toward
economic
reconstruction
is
to
support
the
program
for
recovery
developed
by
the
countries
of
europe
in
my
recent
message
to
the
congress
i
outlined
the
reasons
why
it
is
wise
and
necessary
for
the
united
states
to
extend
this
support
i
want
to
reaffirm
my
belief
in
the
soundness
and
the
promise
of
this
proposal
when
the
european
economy
is
strengthened
the
product
of
its
industry
will
be
of
benefit
to
many
other
areas
of
economic
distress
the
ability
of
free
men
to
overcome
hunger
and
despair
will
be
a
moral
stimulus
to
the
entire
world
we
intend
to
work
also
with
other
nations
in
achieving
world
economic
recovery
we
shall
continue
our
cooperation
with
the
nations
of
the
western
hemisphere
a
special
program
of
assistance
to
china
to
provide
urgent
relief
needs
and
to
speed
reconstruction
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
unfortunately
not
all
governments
share
the
hope
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
economic
reconstruction
in
many
areas
of
the
world
can
be
achieved
through
cooperative
effort
among
nations
in
spite
of
these
differences
we
will
go
forward
with
our
efforts
to
overcome
economic
paralysis
no
nation
by
itself
can
carry
these
programs
to
success
they
depend
upon
the
cooperative
and
honest
efforts
of
all
participating
countries
yet
the
leadership
is
inevitably
ours
i
consider
it
of
the
highest
importance
that
the
congress
should
authorize
support
for
the
european
recovery
program
for
the
period
from
april
to
june
with
an
initial
amount
for
the
first
months
of
billion
i
urge
the
congress
to
act
promptly
on
this
vital
measure
of
our
foreign
policyon
this
decisive
contribution
to
world
peace
we
are
following
a
sound
constructive
and
practical
course
in
carrying
out
our
determination
to
achieve
peace
we
are
fighting
poverty
hunger
and
suffering
this
leads
to
peacenot
war
we
are
building
toward
a
world
where
all
nations
large
and
small
alike
may
live
free
from
the
fear
of
aggression
this
leads
to
peacenot
war
above
all
else
we
are
striving
to
achieve
a
concord
among
the
peoples
of
the
world
based
upon
the
dignity
of
the
individual
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
this
leads
to
peacenot
war
we
can
go
forward
with
confidence
that
we
are
following
sound
policies
both
at
home
and
with
other
nations
which
will
lead
us
toward
our
great
goals
for
economic
social
and
moral
achievement
as
we
enter
the
new
year
we
must
surmount
one
major
problem
which
affects
all
our
goals
that
is
the
problem
of
inflation
already
inflation
in
this
country
is
undermining
the
living
standards
of
millions
of
families
food
costs
too
much
housing
has
reached
fantastic
price
levels
schools
and
hospitals
are
in
financial
distress
inflation
threatens
to
bring
on
disagreement
and
strife
between
labor
and
management
worst
of
all
inflation
holds
the
threat
of
another
depression
just
as
we
had
a
depression
after
the
unstable
boom
following
the
first
world
war
when
i
announced
last
october
that
the
congress
was
being
called
into
session
i
described
the
price
increases
which
had
taken
place
since
june
wholesale
prices
had
increased
percent
retail
prices
had
increased
percent
since
october
prices
have
continued
to
rise
wholesale
prices
have
gone
up
at
an
annual
rate
of
percent
retail
prices
have
gone
up
at
an
annual
rate
of
percent
the
events
which
have
occurred
since
i
presented
my
point
antiinflation
program
to
the
congress
in
november
have
made
it
even
clearer
that
all
points
are
essential
high
prices
must
not
be
our
means
of
rationing
we
must
deal
effectively
and
at
once
with
the
high
cost
of
living
we
must
stop
the
spiral
of
inflation
i
trust
that
within
the
shortest
possible
time
the
congress
will
make
available
to
the
government
the
weapons
that
are
so
desperately
needed
in
the
fight
against
inflation
one
of
the
most
powerful
antiinflationary
factors
in
our
economy
today
is
the
excess
of
government
revenues
over
expenditures
government
expenditures
have
been
and
must
continue
to
be
held
at
the
lowest
safe
levels
since
vj
day
federal
expenditures
have
been
sharply
reduced
they
have
been
cut
from
more
than
billion
in
the
fiscal
year
to
less
than
billion
in
the
present
fiscal
year
the
number
of
civilian
employees
has
been
cut
nearly
in
halffrom
million
down
to
million
on
the
other
hand
government
revenues
must
not
be
reduced
until
inflation
has
been
stopped
there
should
be
no
cut
in
taxes
that
is
not
offset
by
additions
at
another
point
in
our
tax
structure
certain
adjustments
should
be
made
within
our
existing
tax
structure
that
will
not
affect
total
receipts
yet
will
adjust
the
tax
burden
so
that
those
least
able
to
pay
will
have
their
burden
lessened
by
the
transfer
of
a
portion
of
it
to
those
best
able
to
pay
many
of
our
families
today
are
suffering
hardship
because
of
the
high
cost
of
living
at
the
same
time
profits
of
corporations
have
reached
an
alltime
record
in
corporate
profits
total
billion
after
taxes
this
compared
with
billion
in
the
previous
high
year
because
of
this
extraordinarily
high
level
of
profits
corporations
can
well
afford
to
carry
a
larger
share
of
the
taxload
at
this
time
during
this
period
in
which
the
high
cost
of
living
is
bearing
down
on
so
many
of
our
families
tax
adjustments
should
be
made
to
ease
their
burden
the
lowincome
group
particularly
is
being
pressed
very
hard
to
this
group
a
tax
adjustment
would
result
in
a
saving
that
could
be
used
to
buy
the
necessities
of
life
i
recommend
therefore
that
effective
january
a
cost
of
living
tax
credit
be
extended
to
our
people
consisting
of
a
credit
of
to
each
individual
taxpayer
and
an
additional
credit
of
for
each
dependent
p
thus
the
income
tax
of
a
man
with
a
wife
and
two
children
would
be
reduced
the
credit
would
be
extended
to
all
taxpayers
but
it
would
be
particularly
helpful
to
those
in
the
lowincome
group
it
is
estimated
that
such
a
tax
credit
would
reduce
federal
revenue
by
billion
this
reduction
should
be
made
up
by
increasing
the
tax
on
corporate
profits
in
an
amount
that
will
produce
this
sumwith
appropriate
adjustments
for
small
corporations
this
is
the
proper
method
of
tax
relief
at
this
time
it
gives
relief
to
those
who
need
it
most
without
cutting
the
total
tax
revenue
of
the
government
when
the
present
danger
of
inflation
has
passed
we
should
consider
tax
reduction
based
upon
a
revision
of
our
entire
tax
structure
when
we
have
conquered
inflation
we
shall
be
in
a
position
to
move
forward
toward
our
chosen
goals
as
we
do
so
let
us
keep
ever
before
us
our
high
purposes
we
are
determined
that
every
citizen
of
this
nation
shall
have
an
equal
right
and
an
equal
opportunity
to
grow
in
wisdom
and
in
stature
and
to
take
his
place
in
the
control
of
his
nations
destiny
we
are
determined
that
the
productive
resources
of
this
nation
shall
be
used
wisely
and
fully
for
the
benefit
of
all
we
are
determined
that
the
democratic
faith
of
our
people
and
the
strength
of
our
resources
shall
contribute
their
full
share
to
the
attainment
of
enduring
peace
in
the
world
it
is
our
faith
in
human
dignity
that
underlies
these
purposes
it
is
this
faith
that
keeps
us
a
strong
and
vital
people
this
is
a
time
to
remind
ourselves
of
these
fundamentals
for
today
the
whole
world
looks
to
us
for
leadership
this
is
the
hour
to
rededicate
ourselves
to
the
faith
in
mankind
that
makes
us
strong
this
is
the
hour
to
rededicate
ourselves
to
the
faith
in
god
that
gives
us
confidence
as
we
face
the
challenge
of
the
years
ahead

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
it
looks
like
a
good
many
of
you
have
moved
over
to
the
left
since
i
was
here
last
i
come
before
you
today
to
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
and
in
the
words
of
the
constitution
to
recommend
such
measures
as
i
judge
necessary
and
expedient
i
come
also
to
welcome
you
as
you
take
up
your
duties
and
to
discuss
with
you
the
manner
in
which
you
and
i
should
fulfill
our
obligations
to
the
american
people
during
the
next
years
the
power
to
mold
the
future
of
this
nation
lies
in
our
handsyours
and
mine
and
they
are
joined
together
by
the
constitution
if
in
this
year
and
in
the
next
we
can
find
the
right
course
to
take
as
each
issue
arises
and
if
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
we
have
the
courage
and
the
resolution
to
take
that
course
then
we
shall
achieve
a
state
of
wellbeing
for
our
people
without
precedent
in
history
and
if
we
continue
to
work
with
the
other

of
the
world
earnestly
patiently
and
wisely

a
will

the
part
of
our
neighborsmake
a
lasting
peace
for
the
world
but
if
we
are
to
realize
these
ends
the
congress
and
the
president
during
the
next
years
must
work
together
it
is
not
unusual
in
our
history
that
the
majority
of
the
congress
represents
a
party
in
opposition
to
the
presidents
party
i
am
the
twentieth
president
of
the
united
states
who
at
some
time
during
his
term
of
office
has
found
his
own
party
to
be
in
the
minority
in
one
or
both
houses
of
congress
the
first
one
was
george
washington
wilson
was
number
eighteen
and
hoover
was
number
nineteen
i
realize
that
on
some
matters
the
congress
and
the
president
may
have
honest
differences
of
opinion
partisan
differences
however
did
not
cause
material
disagreements
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
war
nor
in
the
conduct
of
our
international
relations
during
and
since
the
war
have
such
partisan
differences
been
material
on
some
domestic
issues
we
may
and
probably
shall
disagree
that
in
itself
is
not
to
be
feared
it
is
inherent
in
our
form
of
government
but
there
are
ways
of
disagreeing
men
who
differ
can
still
work
together
sincerely
for
the
common
good
we
shall
be
risking
the
nations
safety
and
destroying
our
opportunities
for
progress
if
we
do
not
settle
any
disagreements
in
this
spirit
without
thought
of
partisan
advantage
the
general
domestic
economy
as
the
year
begins
the
state
of
our
national
economy
presents
great
opportunities
for
all
we
have
virtually
full
employment
our
national
production
of
goods
and
services
is
percent
higher
than
in
any
year
prior
to
the
war
emergency
the
national
income
in
was
higher
than
in
any
peacetime
year
our
food
production
is
greater
than
it
has
ever
been
during
the
last
years
our
productive
facilities
have
been
expanded
in
almost
every
field
the
american
standard
of
living
is
higher
now
than
ever
before
and
when
the
housing
shortage
can
be
overcome
it
will
be
even
higher
during
the
past
few
months
we
have
removed
at
a
rapid
rate
the
emergency
controls
that
the
federal
government
had
to
exercise
during
the
war
the
remaining
controls
will
be
retained
only
as
long
as
they
are
needed
to
protect
the
public
private
enterprise
must
be
given
the
greatest
possible
freedom
to
continue
the
expansion
of
economy
in
my
proclamation
of
december
i
announced
the
termination
of
hostilities
this
automatically
ended
certain
temporary
legislation
and
certain
executive
powers
two
groups
of
temporary
laws
still
remain
the
first
are
those
which
by
congressional
mandate
are
to
last
during
the
emergency
the
second
are
those
which
are
to
continue
until
the
termination
of
the
war
i
shall
submit
to
the
congress
recommendations
for
the
repeal
of
certain
of
the
statutes
which
by
their
terms
continue
for
the
duration
of
the
emergency
i
shall
at
the
same
time
recommend
that
others
within
this
classification
be
extended
until
the
state
of
war
has
been
ended
by
treaty
or
by
legislative
action
as
to
those
statutes
which
continue
until
the
state
of
war
has
been
terminated
i
urge
that
the
congress
promptly
consider
each
statute
individually
and
repeal
such
emergency
legislation
where
it
is
advisable
now
that
nearly
all
wartime
controls
have
been
removed
the
operation
of
our
industrial
system
depends
to
a
greater
extent
on
the
decisions
of
businessmen
farmers
and
workers
these
decisions
must
be
wisely
made
with
genuine
concern
for
public
welfare
the
welfare
of
businessmen
farmers
and
workers
depends
upon
the
economic
wellbeing
of
those
who
buy
their
products
an
important
present
source
of
danger
to
our
economy
is
the
possibility
that
prices
might
be
raised
to
such
an
extent
that
the
consuming
public
could
not
purchase
the
tremendous
volume
of
goods
and
services
which
will
be
produced
during
we
all
know
that
recent
price
increases
have
denied
to
many
of
our
workers
much
of
the
value
of
recent
wage
increases
farmers
have
found
that
a
large
part
of
their
increased
income
has
been
absorbed
by
increased
prices
while
some
of
our
people
have
received
raises
in
income
which
exceed
price
increases
the
great
majority
have
not
those
persons
who
live
on
modest
fixed
incomesretired
persons
living
on
pensions
for
exampleand
workers
whose
incomes
are
relatively
inflexible
such
as
teachers
and
other
civil
servantshave
suffered
hardship
in
the
effort
to
bring
about
a
sound
and
equitable
price
structure
each
group
of
our
population
has
its
own
responsibilities
it
is
up
to
industry
not
only
to
hold
the
line
on
existing
prices
but
to
make
reductions
whenever
profits
justify
such
action
it
is
up
to
labor
to
refrain
from
pressing
for
unjustified
wage
increases
that
will
force
increases
in
the
price
level
and
it
is
up
to
government
to
do
everything
in
its
power
to
encourage
highvolume
production
for
that
is
what
makes
possible
good
wages
low
prices
and
reasonable
profits
in
a
few
days
there
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
the
economic
report
of
the
president
and
also
the
budget
message
those
messages
will
contain
many
recommendations
today
i
shall
outline
five
major
economic
policies
which
i
believe
the
government
should
pursue
during
these
policies
are
designed
to
meet
our
immediate
needs
and
at
the
same
time
to
provide
for
the
longrange
welfare
of
our
free
enterprise
system
first
the
promotion
of
greater
harmony
between
labor
and
management
second
restriction
of
monopoly
and
unfair
business
practices
assistance
to
small
business
and
the
promotion
of
the
free
competitive
system
of
private
enterprise
third
continuation
of
an
aggressive
program
of
home
construction
fourth
the
balancing
of
the
budget
in
the
next
fiscal
year
and
the
achieving
of
a
substantial
surplus
to
be
applied
to
the
reduction
of
the
public
debt
fifth
protection
of
a
fair
level
of
return
to
farmers
in
postwar
agriculture
labor
and
management
the
year
just
pastlike
the
year
after
the
first
world
warwas
marred
by
labor
management
strife
despite
this
outbreak
of
economic
warfare
in
we
are
today
producing
goods
and
services
in
record
volume
nevertheless
it
is
essential
to
improve
the
methods
for
reaching
agreement
between
labor
and
management
and
to
reduce
the
number
of
strikes
and
lockouts
we
must
not
however
adopt
punitive
legislation
we
must
not
in
order
to
punish
a
few
labor
leaders
pass
vindictive
laws
which
will
restrict
the
proper
rights
of
the
rank
and
file
of
labor
we
must
not
under
the
stress
of
emotion
endanger
our
american
freedoms
by
taking
illconsidered
action
which
will
lead
to
results
not
anticipated
or
desired
we
must
remember
in
reviewing
the
record
of
disputes
in
that
management
shares
with
labor
the
responsibility
for
failure
to
reach
agreements
which
would
have
averted
strikes
for
that
reason
we
must
realize
that
industrial
peace
cannot
be
achieved
merely
by
laws
directed
against
labor
unions
during
the
last
decade
and
a
half
we
have
established
a
national
labor
policy
in
this
country
based
upon
free
collective
bargaining
as
the
process
for
determining
wages
and
working
conditions
that
is
still
the
national
policy
and
it
should
continue
to
be
the
national
policy
but
as
yet
not
all
of
us
have
learned
what
it
means
to
bargain
freely
and
fairly
nor
have
all
of
us
learned
to
carry
the
mutual
responsibilities
that
accompany
the
right
to
bargain
there
have
been
abuses
and
harmful
practices
which
limit
the
effectiveness
of
our
system
of
collective
bargaining
furthermore
we
have
lacked
sufficient
governmental
machinery
to
aid
labor
and
management
in
resolving
their
differences
certain
labormanagement
problems
need
attention
at
once
and
certain
others
by
reason
of
their
complexity
need
exhaustive
investigation
and
study
we
should
enact
legislation
to
correct
certain
abuses
and
to
provide
additional
governmental
assistance
in
bargaining
but
we
should
also
concern
ourselves
with
the
basic
causes
of
labormanagement
difficulties
in
the
light
of
these
considerations
i
propose
to
you
and
urge
your
cooperation
in
effecting
the
following
fourpoint
program
to
reduce
industrial
strife
point
number
one
is
the
early
enactment
of
legislation
to
prevent
certain
unjustifiable
practices
first
under
this
point
are
jurisdictional
strikes
in
such
strikes
the
public
and
the
employer
are
innocent
bystanders
who
are
injured
by
a
collision
between
rival
unions
this
type
of
dispute
hurts
production
industry
and
the
publicand
labor
itself
i
consider
jurisdictional
strikes
indefensible
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
procedures
for
determining
which
union
represents
employees
of
a
particular
employer
in
some
jurisdictional
disputes
however
minority
unions
strike
to
compel
employers
to
deal
with
them
despite
a
legal
duty
to
bargain
with
the
majority
union
strikes
to
compel
an
employer
to
violate
the
law
are
inexcusable
legislation
to
prevent
such
strikes
is
clearly
desirable
another
form
of
interunion
disagreement
is
the
jurisdictional
strike
involving
the
question
of
which
labor
union
is
entitled
to
perform
a
particular
task
when
rival
unions
are
unable
to
settle
such
disputes
themselves
provision
must
be
made
for
peaceful
a
nd
binding
determination
of
the
issues
a
second
unjustifiable
practice
is
the
secondary
boycott
when
used
to
further
jurisdictional
disputes
or
to
compel
employers
to
violate
the
national
labor
relations
act
not
all
secondary
boycotts
are
unjustified
we
must
judge
them
on
the
basis
of
their
objectives
for
example
boycotts
intended
to
protect
wage
rates
and
working
conditions
should
be
distinguished
from
those
in
furtherance
of
jurisdictional
disputes
the
structure
of
industry
sometimes
requires
unions
as
a
matter
of
selfpreservation
to
extend
the
conflict
beyond
a
particular
employer
there
should
be
no
blanket
prohibition
against
boycotts
the
appropriate
goal
is
legislation
which
prohibits
secondary
boycotts
in
pursuance
of
unjustifiable
objectives
but
does
not
impair
the
unions
right
to
preserve
its
own
existence
and
the
gains
made
in
genuine
collective
bargaining
a
third
practice
that
should
be
corrected
is
the
use
of
economic
force
by
either
labor
or
management
to
decide
issues
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
of
existing
contracts
collective
bargaining
agreements
like
other
contracts
should
be
faithfully
adhered
to
by
both
parties
in
the
most
enlightened
unionmanagement
relationships
disputes
over
the
interpretation
of
contract
terms
are
settled
peaceably
by
negotiation
or
arbitration
legislation
should
be
enacted
to
provide
machinery
whereby
unsettled
disputes
concerning
the
interpretation
of
an
existing
agreement
may
be
referred
by
either
party
to
final
and
binding
arbitration
point
number
two
is
the
extension
of
facilities
within
the
department
of
labor
for
assisting
collective
bargaining
one
of
our
difficulties
in
avoiding
labor
strife
arises
from
a
lack
of
order
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
the
parties
often
do
not
have
a
dear
understanding
of
their
responsibility
for
settling
disputes
through
their
own
negotiations
we
constantly
see
instances
where
labor
or
management
resorts
to
economic
force
without
exhausting
the
possibilities
for
agreement
through
the
bargaining
process
neither
the
parties
nor
the
government
have
a
definite
yardstick
for
determining
when
and
how
government
assistance
should
be
invoked
there
is
need
for
integrated
governmental
machinery
to
provide
the
successive
steps
of
mediation
voluntary
arbitration
andultimately
in
appropriate
casesascertainment
of
the
facts
of
the
dispute
and
the
reporting
of
the
facts
to
the
public
such
machinery
would
facilitate
and
expedite
the
settlement
of
disputes
point
number
three
is
the
broadening
of
our
program
of
social
legislation
to
alleviate
the
causes
of
workers
insecurity
on
june
in
my
message
vetoing
the
case
bill
i
made
a
comprehensive
statement
of
my
views
concerning
labormanagement
relations
i
said
then
and
i
repeat
now
that
the
solution
of
labormanagement
difficulties
is
to
be
found
not
only
in
legislation
dealing
directly
with
labor
relations
but
also
in
a
program
designed
to
remove
the
causes
of
insecurity
felt
by
many
workers
in
our
industrial
society
in
this
connection
for
example
the
congress
should
consider
the
extension
and
broadening
of
our
social
security
system
better
housing
a
comprehensive
national
health
program
and
provision
for
a
fair
minimum
wage
point
number
four
is
the
appointment
of
a
temporary
joint
commission
to
inquire
into
the
entire
field
of
labormanagement
relations
i
recommend
that
the
congress
provide
for
the
appointment
of
a
temporary
joint
commission
to
undertake
this
broad
study
the
president
the
congress
and
management
and
labor
have
a
continuing
responsibility
to
cooperate
in
seeking
and
finding
the
solution
of
these
problems
i
therefore
recommend
that
the
commission
be
composed
as
follows
twelve
to
be
chosen
by
the
congress
from
members
of
both
parties
in
the
house
and
the
senate
and
eight
representing
the
public
management
and
labor
to
be
appointed
by
the
president
the
commission
should
be
charged
with
investigating
and
making
recommendations
upon
certain
major
subjects
among
others
first
the
special
and
unique
problem
of
nationwide
strikes
in
vital
industries
affecting
the
public
interest
in
particular
the
commission
should
examine
into
the
question
of
how
to
settle
or
prevent
such
strikes
without
endangering
our
general
democratic
freedoms
upon
a
proper
solution
of
this
problem
may
depend
the
whole
industrial
future
of
the
united
states
the
paralyzing
effects
of
a
nationwide
strike
in
such
industries
as
transportation
coal
oil
steel
or
communications
can
result
in
national
disaster
we
have
been
able
to
avoid
such
disaster
in
recent
years
only
by
the
use
of
extraordinary
war
powers
all
those
powers
will
soon
be
gone
in
their
place
there
must
be
created
an
adequate
system
and
effective
machinery
in
these
vital
fields
this
problem
will
require
careful
study
and
a
bold
approach
but
an
approach
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
the
rights
of
our
people
the
need
is
pressing
the
commission
should
give
this
its
earliest
attention
second
the
best
methods
and
procedures
for
carrying
out
the
collective
bargaining
process
this
should
include
the
responsibilities
of
labor
and
management
to
negotiate
freely
and
fairly
with
each
other
and
to
refrain
from
strikes
or
lockouts
until
all
possibilities
of
negotiation
have
been
exhausted
third
the
underlying
causes
of
labor
management
disputes
some
of
the
subjects
presented
here
for
investigation
involve
longrange
study
others
can
be
considered
immediately
by
the
commission
and
its
recommendations
can
be
submitted
to
the
congress
in
the
near
future
i
recommend
that
this
commission
make
its
first
report
including
specific
legislative
recommendations
not
later
than
march
restriction
of
monopoly
and
promotion
of
private
enterprise
the
second
major
policy
i
desire
to
lay
before
you
has
to
do
with
the
growing
concentration
of
economic
power
and
the
threat
to
free
competitive
private
enterprise
in
the
temporary
national
economic
committee
completed
a
comprehensive
investigation
into
the
workings
of
the
national
economy
the
committees
study
showed
that
despite
a
half
century
of
antitrust
law
enforcement
one
of
the
gravest
threats
to
our
welfare
lay
in
the
increasing
concentration
of
power
in
the
hands
of
a
small
number
of
giant
organizations
during
the
war
this
longstanding
tendency
toward
economic
concentration
was
accelerated
as
a
consequence
we
now
find
that
to
a
greater
extent
than
ever
before
whole
industries
are
dominated
by
one
or
a
few
large
organizations
which
can
restrict
production
in
the
interest
of
higher
profits
and
thus
reduce
employment
and
purchasing
power
in
an
effort
to
assure
full
opportunity
and
free
competition
to
business
we
will
vigorously
enforce
the
antitrust
laws
there
is
much
the
congress
can
do
to
cooperate
and
assist
in
this
program
to
strengthen
and
enforce
the
laws
that
regulate
business
practices
is
not
enough
enforcement
must
be
supplemented
by
positive
measures
of
aid
to
new
enterprises
government
assistance
research
programs
and
credit
powers
should
be
designed
and
used
to
promote
the
growth
of
new
firms
and
new
industries
assistance
to
small
business
is
particularly
important
at
this
time
when
thousands
of
veterans
who
are
potential
business
and
industrial
leaders
are
beginning
their
careers
we
should
also
give
special
attention
to
the
decentralization
of
industry
and
the
development
of
areas
that
are
now
underindustrialized
housing
the
third
major
policy
is
also
of
great
importance
to
the
national
economy
an
aggressive
program
to
encourage
housing
construction
the
first
federal
program
to
relieve
the
veterans
housing
shortage
was
announced
in
february
in
one
million
family
housing
units
have
been
put
under
construction
and
more
than
units
have
already
been
completed
the
rate
of
expansion
in
construction
has
broken
all
records
in
the
coming
year
the
number
of
dwelling
units
built
will
approach
if
not
surpass
the
top
construction
year
of
the
primary
responsibility
to
deliver
housing
at
reasonable
prices
that
veterans
can
afford
rests
with
private
industry
and
with
labor
the
government
will
continue
to
expedite
the
flow
of

to
reach
our
longrange
goal
of
adequate

for

comprehensive
housing
legislation
is
urgently
required
similar
to
the
nonpartisan
bill
passed
by
the
senate
last
year
at
a
minimum
such
legislation
should
open
the
way
for
rebuilding
the
blighted
areas
of
our
cities
and
should
establish
positive
incentives
for
the
investment
of
billions
of
dollars
of
private
capital
in
largescale
rental
housing
projects
it
should
provide
for
improvement
of

and
for
the
construction
over
a
year
period
of
half
a
million

should
authorize

front
fiscal
affairs
the
fourth
major
policy
has
to
do
with
the
balancing
of
the
budget
in
a
prosperous
period
such
as
the
present
one
the
budget
of
the
federal
government
should
be
balanced
prudent
management
of
public
finance
requires
that
we
begin
the
process
of
reducing
the
public
debt
the
budget
which
i
shall
submit
to
you
this
week
has
a
small
margin
of
surplus
in
the
budget
message
i
am
making
recommendations
which
if
accepted
will
result
in
a
substantially
larger
surplus
which
should
be
applied
to
debt
retirement
one
of
these
recommendations
is
that
the
congress
take
early
action
to
continue
throughout
the
next
fiscal
year
the
war
excise
tax
rates
which
under
the
present
law
will
expire
on
june
expenditures
relating
to
the
war
are
still
high
considerable
sums
are
required
to
alleviate
world
famine
and
suffering
aid
to
veterans
will
continue
at
peak
level
the
world
situation
is
such
that
large
military
expenditures
are
required
interest
on
the
public
debt
and
certain
other
costs
are
irreducible
for

these
reasons
i
have
had
to
practice
stringent
economy
in
preparing
the
budget
and
i
hope
that
the
congress
will
cooperate
in
this
program
of
economy
agriculture
the
fifth
major
policy
has
to
do
with
the
welfare
of
our
farm
population
production
of
food
reached
record
heights
in
much
of
our
tremendous
grain
crop
can
readily
be
sold
abroad
and
thus
will
become
no
threat
to
our
domestic
markets
but
in
the
next
few
years
american
agriculture
can
face
the
same
dangers
it
did
after
world
war
i
in
the
early
twenties
the
nation
failed
to
maintain
outlets
for
the
new
productive
capacity
of
our
agricultural
plant
it
failed
to
provide
means
to
protect
the
farmer
while
he
adjusted
his
acreage
to
peacetime
demands
the
result
we
all
remember
too
well
farm
production
stayed
up
while
demand
and
prices
fell
in
contrast
with
industry
where
prices
stayed
up
and
output
declined
farm
surpluses
piled
up
and
disaster
followed
we
must
make
sure
of
meeting
the
problems
which
we
failed
to
meet
after
the
first
world
war
present
laws
give
considerable
stability
to
farm
prices
for
and
and
these
years
must
be
utilized
to
maintain
and
develop
markets
for
our
great
productive
power
the
purpose
of
these
laws
was
to
permit
an
orderly
transition
from
war
to
peace
the
government
plan
of
support
prices
was
not
designed
to
absorb
at
great
cost
the
unlimited
surpluses
of
a
highly
productive
agriculture
we
must
not
wait
until
the
guarantees
expire
to
set
the
stage
for
permanent
farm
welfare
the
farmer
is
entitled
to
a
fair
income
ways
can
be
found
to
utilize
his
new
skills
and
better
practices
to
expand
his
markets
at
home
and
abroad
and
to
carry
out
the
objectives
of
a
balanced
pattern
of
peacetime
production
without
either
undue
sacrifice
by
farm
people
or
undue
expense
to
the
government
health
and
general
welfare
of
all
our
national
resources
none
is
of
more
basic
value
than
the
health
of
our
people
over
a
year
ago
i
presented
to
the
congress
my
views
on
a
national
health
program
the
congress
acted
on
several
of
the
recommendations
in
this
programmental
health
the
health
of
mothers
and
children
and
hospital
construction
i
urge
this
congress
to
complete
the
work
begun
last
year
and
to
enact
the
most
important
recommendation
of
the
programto
provide
adequate
medical
care
to
all
who
need
it
not
as
charity
but
on
the
basis
of
payments
made
by
the
beneficiaries
of
the
program
one
administrative
change
would
help
greatly
to
further
our
national
program
in
the
fields
of
health
education
and
welfare
i
again
recommend
the
establishment
of
a
wellintegrated
department
of

servicemen
have
returned
to
civil
life
the
great
majority
have
found
their
places
as
citizens
of
their
communities
and
their
nation
it
is
a
tribute
to
the
fiber
of
our
servicemen
and
to
the
flexibility
of
our
economy
that
these
adjustments
have
been
made
so
rapidly
and
so
successfully
more
than
two
million
of
these
veterans
are
attending
schools
or
acquiring
job
skills
through
the
financial
assistance
of
the
federal
government
thousands
of
sick
and
wounded
veterans
are
daily
receiving
the
best
of
medical
and
hospital
care
half
a
million
have
obtained
loans
with
government
guarantees
to
purchase
homes
or
farms
or
to
embark
upon
new

compensation
is
being
paid
in

the
program
for
veterans
of
all
wars
is
costing
over
seven
billion
dollars

yearonefifth
of
our
total
federal
budget
this
is
the
most
farreaching
and
complete
veterans
program
ever
conceived
by
any
nation
except
for
minor
adjustments
i
believe
that
our
program
of
benefits
for
veterans
is
now
complete
in
the
long
run
the
success
of
the
program
will
not
be
measured
by
the
number
of
veterans
receiving
financial
aid
or
by
the
number
of
dollars
we
spend
history
will
judge
us
not
by
the
money
we
spend
but
by
the
further
contribution
we
enable
our
veterans
to
make
to
their
country
in
considering
any
additional
legislation
that
must
be
our
criterion
civil
rights
we
have
recently
witnessed
in
this
country
numerous
attacks
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
individual
citizens
as
a
result
of
racial
and
religious
bigotry
substantial
segments
of
our
people
have
been
prevented
from
exercising
fully
their
right
to
participate
in
the
election
of
public
officials
both
locally
and
nationally
freedom
to
engage
in
lawful
callings
has
been
denied
the
will
to
fight
these
crimes
should
be
in
the
hearts
of
every
one
of
us
for
the
federal
government
that
fight
is
now
being
carried
on
by
the
department
of
justice
to
the
full
extent
of
the
powers
that
have
been
conferred
upon
it
while
the
constitution
withholds
from
the
federal
government
the
major
task
of
preserving
peace
in
the
several
states
i
am
not
convinced
that
the
present
legislation
reached
the
limit
of
federal
power
to
protect
the
civil
rights
of
its
citizens
i
have
therefore
by
executive
order
established
the
presidents
committee
on
civil

to
study
and
report
on
the
whole
problem

security
of
our
country
depend
upon
an
expanding

of
mineral
discovery
and
upon
improved
methods

the

need

progress
in
reaching

domestic

is
closely

all
that
i
have
said
about
maintaining
a
sound
and
prosperous
economy
and
improving
the
welfare
of
our
people
has
greater
meaning
because
of
the
world
leadership
of
the
united
states
what
we
do
or
fail
to
do
at
home
affects
not
only
ourselves
but
millions
throughout
the
world
if
we
are
to
fulfill
our
responsibilities
to
ourselves
and
to
other
peoples
we
must
make
sure
that
the
united
states
is
sound
economically
socially
and
politically
only
then
will
we
be
able
to
help
bring
about
the
elements
of

and
social

peace
treaties
for
italy
bulgaria
rumania
and
hungary
have
finally
been
prepared
following
the
signing
of
these
treaties
next
month
in
paris
they
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
this
government
does
not
regard
the
treaties
as
completely
satisfactory
whatever
their
defects
however
i
am
convinced
that
they
are
as
good
as
we
can
hope
to
obtain
by
agreement
among
the
principal
wartime
allies
further
dispute
and
delay
would
gravely
jeopardize
political
stability
in
the
countries
concerned
for
many
years
during
the
long
months
of
debate
on
these
treaties
we
have
made
it
clear
to
all
nations
that
the
united
states
will
not
consent
to
settlements
at
the
expense
of
principles
we
regard
as
vital
to
a
just
and
enduring
peace
we
have
made
it
equally
dear
that
we
will
not
retreat
to
isolationism
our
policies
will
be
the
same
during
the
forthcoming
negotiations
in
moscow
on
the
german
and
austrian
treaties
and
during
the
future
conferences
on
the
japanese
treaty
the
delay
in
arriving
at
the
first
peace
settlements
is
due
partly
to
the
difficulty
of
reaching
agreement
with
the
soviet
union
on
the
terms
of
settlement
whatever
differences
there
may
have
been
between
us
and
the
soviet
union
however
should
not
be
allowed
to
obscure
the
fact
that
the
basic
interests
of
both
nations
lie
in
the
early
making
of
a
peace
under
which
the
peoples
of
all
countries
may
return
as
free
men
and
women
to
the
essential
tasks
of
production
and
reconstruction
the
major
concern
of
each
of
us
should
be
the
promotion
of
collective
security
not
the
advancement
of
individual
security
our
policy
toward
the
soviet
union
is
guided
by
the
same
principles
which
determine
our
policies
toward
all
nations
we
seek
only
to
uphold
the
principles
of
international
justice
which
have
been
embodied
in
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
we
must
now
get
on
with
the
peace
settlements
the
occupying
powers
should
recognize
the
independence
of
austria
and
withdraw
their
troops
the
germans
and
the
japanese
cannot
be
left
in
doubt
and
fear
as
to
their
future
they
must
know
their
national
boundaries
their
resources
and
what
reparations
they
must
pay
without
trying
to
manage
their
internal
affairs
we
can
insure
that
these
countries
do
not
rearm
international
relief
and
displaced
persons
the
united
states
can
be
proud
of
its
part
in
caring
for
the
peoples
reduced
to
want
by
the
ravages
of
war
and
in
aiding
nations
to
restore
their
national
economies
we
have
shipped
more
supplies
to
the
hungry
peoples
of
the
world
since
the
end
of
the
war
than
all
other
countries
combined
however
insofar
as
admitting
displaced
persons
is
concerned
i
do
not
feel
that
the
united
states
has
done
its
part
only
about
of
them
have
entered
this
country
since
may
the
fact
is
that
the
executive
agencies
are
now
doing
all
that
is
reasonably
possible
under
the
limitation
of
the
existing
law
and
established
quotas
congressional
assistance
in
the
form
of
new

is
needed
i
urge
the
congress
to
turn
its
attention
to
this
world
problem
in
an
effort
to
find
ways
whereby
we
can
fulfill
our
responsibilities

we
must
now

atomic

the
united
states
has
taken
the
lead
in
the
endeavor
to
put
atomic
energy
under
effective
international
control
we
seek
no
monopoly
for
ourselves
or
for
any
group
of
nations
we
ask
only
that
there
be
safeguards
sufficient
to
insure
that
no
nation
will
be
able
to
use
this
power
for
military
purposes
so
long
as
all
governments
are
not
agreed
on
means
of
international
control
of
atomic
energy
the
shadow
of
fear
will
obscure
the
bright
prospects
for
the
peaceful
use
of
this
enormous
power
in
accordance
with
the
atomic
energy
act
of
the
commission
established
under
that
law
is
assuming
full
jurisdiction
over
domestic
atomic
energy
enterprise
the
program
of
the
commission
will
of
course
be
worked
out
in
close
collaboration
with
the
military
services
in
conformity
with
the
wish
of
the
congress
but
it
is
my
fervent
hope
that
the
military
significance
of
atomic
energy
will
steadily
decline
we
look
to
the
commission
to
foster
the
development
of
atomic
energy
for
industrial
use
and
scientific
and
medical
research
in
the
vigorous
and
effective
development
of
peaceful
uses
of
atomic
energy
rests
our
hope
that
this
new
force
may
ultimately
be
turned
into
a
blessing
for
all
nations
military
policy
in
the
army
and
navy
completed
the
demobilization
of
their
wartime
forces
they
are
now
maintaining
the
forces
which
we
need
for
national
defense
and
to
fulfill
our
international
obligations
we
live
in
a
world
in
which
strength
on
the
part
of
peaceloving
nations
is
still
the
greatest
deterrent
to
aggression
world
stability
can
be
destroyed
when
nations
with
great
responsibilities
neglect
to
maintain
the
means
of
discharging
those
responsibilities
this
is
an
age
when
unforeseen
attack
could
come
with
unprecedented
speed
we
must
be
strong
enough
to
defeat
and
thus
forestall
any
such
attack
in
our
steady
progress
toward
a
more
rational
world
order
the
need
for
large
armed
forces
is
progressively
declining
but
the
stabilizing
force
of
american
military
strength
must
not
be
weakened
until
our
hopes
are
fully
realized
when
a
system
of
collective
security
under
the
united
nations
has
been
established
we
shall
be
willing
to
lead
in
collective
disarmament
but
until
such
a
system
becomes
a
reality
we
must
not
again
allow
ourselves
to
become
weak
and
invite
attack
for
those
reasons
we
need
wellequipped
welltrained
armed
forces
and
we
must
be
able
to
mobilize
rapidly
our
resources
in
men
and
material
for
our
own
defense
should
the
need
arise
the
army
will
be
reduced
to
officers
and
men
by
july
half
of
the
army
will
be
used
for
occupation
duties
abroad
and
most
of
the
remainder
will
be
employed
at
home
in
the
support
of
these
overseas
forces
the
navy
is
supporting
the
occupation
troops
in
europe
and
in
the
far
east
its
fundamental
missionto
support
our
national
interests
wherever
requiredis
unchanged
the
navy
including
the
marine
corps
will
average
officers
and
men
during
the
fiscal
year
we
are
encountering
serious
difficulties
in
maintaining
our
forces
at
even
these
reduced
levels
occupation
troops
are
barely
sufficient
to
carry
out
the
duties
which
our
foreign
policy
requires
our
forces
at
home
are
at
a
point
where
further
reduction
is
impracticable
we
should
like
an
army
and
a
navy
composed
entirely
of
longterm
volunteers
but
in
spite
of
liberal
inducements
the
basic
needs
of
the
army
are
not
now
being
met
by
voluntary
enlistments
the
war
department
has
advised
me
that
it
is
unable
to
make
an
accurate
forecast
at
the
present
time
as
to
whether
it
will
be
possible
to
maintain
the
strength
of
the
army
by
relying
exclusively
on
volunteers
the
situation
will
be
much
clearer
in
a
few
weeks
when
the
results
of
the
campaign
for
volunteers
are
known
the
war
department
will
make
its
recommendations
as
to
the
need
for
the
extension
of
selective
service
in
sufficient
time
to
enable
the

to
take
action
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
present
law
on
march
st
the
responsibility
for
maintaining
our
armed
forces
at
the
strength
necessary
for
our
national
safety
rests
with
the
congress
the
development
of
a
trained
citizen
reserve
is
also
vital
to
our
national
security
this
can
best
be
accomplished
through
universal
training
i
have
appointed
an
advisory
commission
on
universal
training
to
study
the
various
plans
for
a
training
program
and
i
expect
that
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
will
be
of
benefit
to
the
congress
and
to
me
in
reaching
decisions
on
this
problem
the
cost
of
the
military
establishment
is
substantial
there
is
one
certain
way
by
which
we
can
cut
costs
and
at
the
same
time
enhance
our
national
security
that
is
by
the
establishment
of
a
single
department
of
national
defense
i
shall
communicate
with
the
congress
in
the
near
future
with
reference
to
the
establishment
of
a
single
department
of
national
defense
national
security
does
not
consist
only
of
an
army
a
navy
and
an
air
force
it
rests
on
a
much
broader
basis
it
depends
on
a
sound
economy
of
prices
and
wages
on
prosperous
agriculture
on
satisfied
and
productive
workers
on
a
competitive
private
enterprise
free
from
monopolistic
repression
on
continued
industrial
harmony
and
production
on
civil
liberties
and
human
freedomson
all
the
forces
which
create
in
our
men
and
women
a
strong
moral
fiber
and
spiritual
stamina
but
we
have
a
higher
duty
and
a
greater
responsibility
than
the
attainment
of
our
own
national
security
our
goal
is
collective
security
for
all
mankind
if
we
can
work
in
a
spirit
of
understanding
and
mutual
respect
we
can
fulfill
this
solemn
obligation
which
rests
upon
us
the
spirit
of
the
american
people
can
set
the
course
of
world
history
if
we
maintain
and
strengthen
our
cherished
ideals
and
if
we
share
our
great
bounty
with
warstricken
people
over
the
world
then
the
faith
of
our
citizens
in
freedom
and
democracy
will
be
spread
over
the
whole
earth
and
free
men
everywhere
will
share
our
devotion
to
those
ideals
let
us
have
the
will
and
the
patience
to
this
job
together
may
the
lord
strengthen
us
in
our
faith
may
he
give
us
wisdom
to
lead
the
peoples
of
the
world
in
his
ways
of
peace

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
a
quarter
century
ago
the
congress
decided
that
it
could
no
longer
consider
the
financial
programs
of
the
various
departments
on
a
piecemeal
basis
instead
it
has
called
on
the
president
to
present
a
comprehensive
executive
budget
the
congress
has
shown
its
satisfaction
with
that
method
by
extending
the
budget
system
and
tightening
its
controls
the
bigger
and
more
complex
the
federal
program
the
more
necessary
it
is
for
the
chief
executive
to
submit
a
single
budget
for
action
by
the
congress
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
the
budgetary
program
and
the
general
program
of
the
government
are
actually
inseparable
the
president
bears
the
responsibility
for
recommending
to
the
congress
a
comprehensive
set
of
proposals
on
all
government
activities
and
their
financing
in
formulating
policies
as
in
preparing
budgetary
estimates
the
nation
and
the
congress
have
the
right
to
expect
the
president
to
adjust
and
coordinate
the
views
of
the
various
departments
and
agencies
to
form
a
unified
program
and
that
program
requires
consideration
in
connection
with
the
budget
which
is
the
annual
work
program
of
the
government
since
our
programs
for
this
period
which
combines
war
liquidation
with
reconversion
to
a
peacetime
economy
are
inevitably
large
and
numerous
it
is
imperative
that
they
be
planned
and
executed
with
the
utmost
efficiency
and
the
utmost
economy
we
have
cut
the
war
program
to
the
maximum
extent
consistent
with
national
security
we
have
held
our
peacetime
programs
to
the
level
necessary
to
our
national
wellbeing
and
the
attainment
of
our
postwar
objectives
where
increased
programs
have
been
recommended
the
increases
have
been
held
as
low
as
is
consistent
with
these
goals
i
can
assure
the
congress
of
the
necessity
of
these
programs
i
can
further
assure
the
congress
that
the
program
as
a
whole
is
well
within
our
capacity
to
finance
it
all
the
programs
i
have
recommended
for
action
are
included
in
the
budget
figures
for
these
reasons
i
have
chosen
to
combine
the
customary
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
with
the
annual
budget
message
and
to
include
in
the
budget
not
only
estimates
for
functions
authorized
by
the
congress
but
also
for
those
which
i
recommend
for
its
action
i
am
also
transmitting
herewith
the
fifth
quarterly
report
of
the
director
of
war
mobilization
and
reconversion
it
is
a
comprehensive
discussion
of
the
present
state
of
the
reconversion
program
and
of
the
immediate
and
longrange
needs
and
recommendations

this
constitutes
then
as
complete
a
report
as
i
find
it
possible
to
prepare
now
it
constitutes
a
program
of
government
in
relation
to
the
nations
needs
with
the
growing
responsibility
of
modern
government
to
foster
economic
expansion
and
to
promote
conditions
that
assure
full
and
steady
employment
opportunities
it
has
become
necessary
to
formulate
and
determine
the
government
program
in
the
light
of
national
economic
conditions
as
a
whole
in
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
we
must
make
arrangements
which
will
permit
us
to
formulate
the
government
program
in
that
light
such
an
approach
has
become
imperative
if
the
american
political
and
economic
system
is
to
succeed
under
the
conditions
of
economic
instability
and
uncertainty
which
we
have
to
face
the
government
needs
to
assure
business
labor
and
agriculture
that
government
policies
will
take
due
account
of
the
requirements
of
a
full
employment
economy
the
lack
of
that
assurance
would
i
believe
aggravate
the
economic
instability
with
the
passage
of
a
full
employment
bill
which
i
confidently
anticipate
for
the
very
near
future
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
government
will
be
empowered
to
devote
their
best
talents
and
resources
in
subsequent
years
to
preparing
and
acting
on
such
a
program
i
from
war
to
peacethe
year
of
decision
in
his
last
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
delivered
one
year
ago
president
roosevelt
said
this
new
year
of
can
be
the
greatest
year
of
achievement
in
human
history
can
see
the
final
ending
of
the
nazifascist
reign
of
terror
in
europe
can
see
the
closing
in
of
the
forces
of
retribution
about
the
center
of
the
malignant
power
of
imperialistic
japan
most
important
of
all
can
and
must
see
the
substantial
beginning
of
the
organization
of
world
peace
all
those
hopes
and
more
were
fulfilled
in
the
year
it
was
the
greatest
year
of
achievement
in
human
history
it
saw
the
end
of
the
nazifascist
terror
in
europe
and
also
the
end
of
the
malignant
power
of
japan
and
it
saw
the
substantial
beginning
of
world
organization
for
peace
these
momentous
events
became
realities
because
of
the
steadfast
purpose
of
the
united
nations
and
of
the
forces
that
fought
for
freedom
under
their
flags
the
plain
fact
is
that
civilization
was
saved
in
by
the
united
nations
our
own
part
in
this
accomplishment
was
not
the
product
of
any
single
service
those
who
fought
on
land
those
who
fought
on
the
sea
and
those
who
fought
in
the
air
deserve
equal
credit
they
were
supported
by
other
millions
in
the
armed
forces
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
could
not
go
overseas
and
who
rendered
indispensable
service
in
this
country
they
were
supported
by
millions
in
all
levels
of
government
including
many
volunteers
whose
devoted
public
service
furnished
basic
organization
and
leadership
they
were
also
supported
by
the
millions
of
americans
in
private
lifemen
and
women
in
industry
in
commerce
on
the
farms
and
in
all
manner
of
activity
on
the
home
frontwho
contributed
their
brains
and
their
brawn
in
arming
equipping
and
feeding
them
the
country
was
brought
through
four
years
of
peril
by
an
effort
that
was
truly
national
in
character
everlasting
tribute
and
gratitude
will
be
paid
by
all
americans
to
those
brave
men
who
did
not
come
back
who
will
never
come
backthe
who
died
that
the
nation
might
live
and
progress
all
americans
will
also
remain
deeply
conscious
of
the
obligation
owed
to
that
larger
number
of
soldiers
sailors
and
marines
who
suffered
wounds
and
sickness
in
their
service
they
may
be
certain
that
their
sacrifice
will
never
be
forgotten
or
their
needs
neglected
the
beginning
of
the
year
finds
the
united
states
strong
and
deservedly
confident
we
have
a
record
of
enormous
achievements
as
a
democratic
society
in
solving
problems
and
meeting
opportunities
as
they
developed
we
find
ourselves
possessed
of
immeasurable
advantagesvast
and
varied
natural
resources
great
plants
institutions
and
other
facilities
unsurpassed
technological
and
managerial
skills
an
alert
resourceful
and
able
citizenry
we
have
in
the
united
states
government
rich
resources
in
information
perspective
and
facilities
for
doing
whatever
may
be
found
necessary
to
do
in
giving
support
and
form
to
the
widespread
and
diversified
efforts
of
all
our
people
and
for
the
immediate
future
the
business
prospects
are
generally
so
favorable
that
there
is
danger
of
such
feverish
and
opportunistic
activity
that
our
grave
postwar
problems
may
be
neglected
we
need
to
act
now
with
full
regard
for
pitfalls
we
need
to
act
with
foresight
and
balance
we
should
not
be
lulled
by
the
immediate
alluring
prospects
into
forgetting
the
fundamental
complexity
of
modern
affairs
the
catastrophe
that
can
come
in
this
complexity
or
the
values
that
can
be
wrested
from
it
but
the
longrange
difficulties
we
face
should
no
more
lead
to
despair
than
our
immediate
business
prospects
should
lead
to
the
optimism
which
comes
from
the
present
shortrange
prospect
on
the
foundation
of
our
victory
we
can
build
a
lasting
peace
with
greater
freedom
and
security
for
mankind
in
our
country
and
throughout
the
world
we
will
more
certainly
do
this
if
we
are
constantly
aware
of
the
fact
that
we
face
crucial
issues
and
prepare
now
to
meet
them
to
achieve
success
will
require
both
boldness
in
setting
our
sights
and
caution
in
steering
our
way
on
an
uncharted
course
but
we
have
no
luxury
of
choice
we
must
move
ahead
no
return
to
the
past
is
possible
our
nation
has
always
been
a
land
of
great
opportunities
for
those
people
of
the
world
who
sought
to
become
part
of
us
now
we
have
become
a
land
of
great
responsibilities
to
all
the
people
of
all
the
world
we
must
squarely
recognize
and
face
the
fact
of
those
responsibilities
advances
in
science
in
communication
in
transportation
have
compressed
the
world
into
a
community
the
economic
and
political
health
of
each
member
of
the
world
community
bears
directly
on
the
economic
and
political
health
of
each
other
member
the
evolution
of
centuries
has
brought
us
to
a
new
era
in
world
history
in
which
manifold
relationships
between
nations
must
be
formalized
and
developed
in
new
and
intricate
ways
the
united
nations
organization
now
being
established
represents
a
minimum
essential
beginning
it
must
be
developed
rapidly
and
steadily
its
work
must
be
amplified
to
fill
in
the
whole
pattern
that
has
been
outlined
economic
collaboration
for
example
already
charted
now
must
be
carried
on
as
carefully
and
as
comprehensively
as
the
political
and
security
measures
it
is
important
that
the
nations
come
together
as
states
in
the
assembly
and
in
the
security
council
and
in
the
other
specialized
assemblies
and
councils
that
have
been
and
will
be
arranged
but
this
is
not
enough
our
ultimate
security
requires
more
than
a
process
of
consultation
and
compromise
it
requires
that
we
begin
now
to
develop
the
united
nations
organization
as
the
representative
of
the
world
as
one
society
the
united
nations
organization
if
we
have
the
will
adequately
to
staff
it
and
to
make
it
work
as
it
should
will
provide
a
great
voice
to
speak
constantly
and
responsibly
in
terms
of
world
collaboration
and
world
wellbeing
there
are
many
new
responsibilities
for
us
as
we
enter
into
this
new
international
era
the
whole
power
and
will
and
wisdom
of
our
government
and
of
our
people
should
be
focused
to
contribute
to
and
to
influence
international
action
it
is
intricate
continuing
bus
iness
many
concessions
and
adjustments
will
be
required
the
spectacular
progress
of
science
in
recent
years
makes
these
necessities
more
vivid
and
urgent
that
progress
has
speeded
internal
development
and
has
changed
world
relationships
so
fast
that
we
must
realize
the
fact
of
a
new
era
it
is
an
era
in
which
affairs
have
become
complex
and
rich
in
promise
delicate
and
intricate
relationships
involving
us
all
in
countless
ways
must
be
carefully
considered
on
the
domestic
scene
as
well
as
on
the
international
scene
we
must
lay
a
new
and
better
foundation
for
cooperation
we
face
a
great
peacetime
venture
the
challenging
venture
of
a
free
enterprise
economy
making
full
and
effective
use
of
its
rich
resources
and
technical
advances
this
is
a
venture
in
which
business
agriculture
and
labor
have
vastly
greater
opportunities
than
heretofore
but
they
all
also
have
vastly
greater
responsibilities
we
will
not
measure
up
to
those
responsibilities
by
the
simple
return
to
normalcy
that
was
tried
after
the
last
war
the
general
objective
on
the
contrary
is
to
move
forward
to
find
the
way
in
time
of
peace
to
the
full
utilization
and
development
of
our
physical
and
human
resources
that
were
demonstrated
so
effectively
in
the
war
to
accomplish
this
it
is
not
intended
that
the
federal
government
should
do
things
that
can
be
done
as
well
for
the
nation
by
private
enterprise
or
by
state
and
local
governments
on
the
contrary
the
war
has
demonstrated
how
effectively
we
can
organize
our
productive
system
and
develop
the
potential
abilities
of
our
people
by
aiding
the
efforts
of
private
enterprise
as
we
move
toward
one
common
objective
there
will
be
many
and
urgent
problems
to
meet
industrial
peace
between
management
and
labor
will
have
to
be
achievedthrough
the
process
of
collective
bargainingwith
government
assistance
but
not
government
compulsion
this
is
a
problem
which
is
the
concern
not
only
of
management
labor
and
the
government
but
also
the
concern
of
every
one
of
us
private
capital
and
private
management
are
entitled
to
adequate
reward
for
efficiency
but
business
must
recognize
that
its
reward
results
from
the
employment
of
the
resources
of
the
nation
business
is
a
public
trust
and
must
adhere
to
national
standards
in
the
conduct
of
its
affairs
these
standards
include
as
a
minimum
the
establishment
of
fair
wages
and
fair
employment
practices
labor
also
has
its
own
new
peacetime
responsibilities
under
our
collective
bargaining
system
which
must
become
progressively
more
secure
labor
attains
increasing
political
as
well
as
economic
power
and
this
as
with
all
power
means
increased
responsibility
the
lives
of
millions
of
veterans
and
war
workers
will
be
greatly
affected
by
the
success
or
failure
of
our
program
of
war
liquidation
and
reconversion
their
transition
to
peacetime
pursuits
will
be
determined
by
our
efforts
to
break
the
bottlenecks
in
key
items
of
production
to
make
surplus
property
immediately
available
where
it
is
needed
to
maintain
an
effective
national
employment
service
and
many
other
reconversion
policies
our
obligations
to
the
people
who
won
the
war
will
not
be
paid
if
we
fail
to
prevent
inflation
and
to
maintain
employment
opportunities
while
our
peacetime
prosperity
will
be
based
on
the
private
enterprise
the
government
can
and
must
assist
in
many
ways
it
is
the
governments
responsibility
to
see
that
our
economic
system
remains
competitive
that
new
businesses
have
adequate
opportunities
and
that
our
national
resources
are
restored
and
improved
government
must
realize
the
effect
of
its
operations
on
the
whole
economy
it
is
the
responsibility
of
government
to
gear
its
total
program
to
the
achievement
of
full
production
and
full
employment
our
basic
objectivetoward
which
all
others
leadis
to
improve
the
welfare
of
the
american
people
in
addition
to
economic
prosperity
this
means
that
we
use
social
security
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
and
people
must
be
protected
from
excessive
want
during
old
age
sickness
and
unemployment
opportunities
for
a
good
economy
and
adequate
medical
care
must
be
readily
available
every
family
should
build
a
decent
home
the
new
economic
rights
to
which
i
have
referred
on
previous
occasions
is
a
charter
of
economic
freedom
which
seeks
to
assure
that
all
who
will
may
work
toward
their
own
security
and
the
general
advancement
that
we
become
a
wellhoused
people
a
wellnourished
people
an
educated
people
a
people
socially
and
economically
secure
an
alert
and
responsible
people
these
and
other
problems
which
may
face
us
can
be
met
by
the
cooperation
of
all
of
us
in
furthering
a
positive
and
wellbalanced
government
programa
program
which
will
further
national
and
international
wellbeing
ii
the
federal
program
international
affairs
i
foreign
policy
the
year
brought
with
it
the
final
defeat
of
our
enemies
there
lies
before
us
now
the
work
of
building
a
just
and
enduring
peace
our
most
immediate
task
toward
that
end
is
to
deprive
our
enemies
completely
and
forever
of
their
power
to
start
another
war
of
even
greater
importance
to
the
preservation
of
international
peace
is
the
need
to
preserve
the
wartime
agreement
of
the
united
nations
and
to
direct
it
into
the
ways
of
peace
long
before
our
enemies
surrendered
the
foundations
had
been
laid
on
which
to
continue
this
unity
in
the
peace
to
come
the
atlantic
meeting
in
and
the
conferences
at
casablanca
quebec
moscow
cairo
tehran
and
dumbarton
oaks
each
added
a
stone
to
the
structure
early
in
at
yalta
the
three
major
powers
broadened
and
solidified
this
base
of
understanding
there
fundamental
decisions
were
reached
concerning
the
occupation
and
control
of
germany
there
also
a
formula
was
arrived
at
for
the
interim
government
of
the
areas
in
europe
which
were
rapidly
being
wrested
from
nazi
control
this
formula
was
based
on
the
policy
of
the
united
states
that
people
be
permitted
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
by
their
own
freely
expressed
choice
without
interference
from
any
foreign
source
at
potsdam
in
july
marshal
stalin
prime
ministers
churchill
and
attlee
and
i
met
to
exchange
views
primarily
with
respect
to
germany
as
a
result
agreements
were
reached
which
outlined
broadly
the
policy
to
be
executed
by
the
allied
control
council
at
potsdam
there
was
also
established
a
council
of
foreign
ministers
which
convened
for
the
first
time
in
london
in
september
the
council
is
about
to
resume
its
primary
assignment
of
drawing
up
treaties
of
peace
with
italy
rumania
bulgaria
hungary
and
finland
in
addition
to
these
meetings
and
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
at
yalta
the
foreign
ministers
of
great
britain
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
conferred
together
in
san
francisco
last
spring
in
potsdam
in
july
in
london
in
september
and
in
moscow
in
december
these
meetings
have
been
useful
in
promoting
understanding
and
agreement
among
the
three
governments
simply
to
name
all
the
international
meetings
and
conferences
is
to
suggest
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
undertaking
to
prevent
international
war
in
which
the
united
states
has
now
enlisted
for
the
duration
of
history
it
is
encouraging
to
know
that
the
common
effort
of
the
united
nations
to
learn
to
live
together
did
not
cease
with
the
surrender
of
our
enemies
when
difficulties
arise
among
us
the
united
states
does
not
propose
to
remove
them
by
sacrificing
its
ideals
or
its
vital
interests
neither
do
we
propose
however
to
ignore
the
ideals
and
vital
interests
of
our
friends
last
february
and
march
an
interamerican
conference
on
problems
of
war
and
peace
was
held
in
mexico
city
among
the
many
significant
accomplishments
of
that
conference
was
an
understanding
that
an
attack
by
any
country
against
any
one
of
the
sovereign
american
republics
would
be
considered
an
act
of
aggression
against
all
of
them
and
that
if
such
an
attack
were
made
or
threatened
the
american
republics
would
decide
jointly
through
consultations
in
which
each
republic
has
equal
representation
what
measures
they
would
take
for
their
mutual
protection
this
agreement
stipulates
that
its
execution
shall
be
in
full
accord
with
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
organization
the
first
meeting
of
the
general
assembly
of
the
united
nations
now
in
progress
in
london
marks
the
real
beginning
of
our
bold
adventure
toward
the
preservation
of
world
peace
to
which
is
bound
the
dearest
hope
of
men
we
have
solemnly
dedicated
ourselves
and
all
our
will
to
the
success
of
the
united
nations
organization
for
this
reason
we
have
sought
to
insure
that
in
the
peacemaking
the
smaller
nations
shall
have
a
voice
as
well
as
the
larger
states
the
agreement
reached
at
moscow
last
month
preserves
this
opportunity
in
the
making
of
peace
with
italy
rumania
bulgaria
hungary
and
finland
the
united
states
intends
to
preserve
it
when
the
treaties
with
germany
and
japan
are
drawn
it
will
be
the
continuing
policy
of
the
united
states
to
use
all
its
influence
to
foster
support
and
develop
the
united
nations
organization
in
its
purpose
of
preventing
international
war
if
peace
is
to
endure
it
must
rest
upon
justice
no
less
than
upon
power
the
question
is
how
justice
among
nations
is
best
achieved
we
know
from
daytoday
experience
that
the
chance
for
a
just
solution
is
immeasurably
increased
when
everyone
directly
interested
is
given
a
voice
that
does
not
mean
that
each
must
enjoy
an
equal
voice
but
it
does
mean
that
each
must
be
heard
last
november
prime
minister
attlee
prime
minister
mackenzie
king
and
i
announced
our
proposal
that
a
commission
be
established
within
the
framework
of
the
united
nations
to
explore
the
problems
of
effective
international
control
of
atomic
energy
the
soviet
union
france
and
china
have
joined
us
in
the
purpose
of
introducing
in
the
general
assembly
a
resolution
for
the
establishment
of
such
a
commission
our
earnest
wish
is
that
the
work
of
this
commission
go
forward
carefully
and
thoroughly
but
with
the
greatest
dispatch
i
have
great
hope
for
the
development
of
mutually
effective
safeguards
which
will
permit
the
fullest
international
contr
ol
of
this
new
atomic
force
i
believe
it
possible
that
effective
means
can
be
developed
through
the
united
nations
organization
to
prohibit
outlaw
and
prevent
the
use
of
atomic
energy
for
destructive
purposes
the
power
which
the
united
states
demonstrated
during
the
war
is
the
fact
that
underlies
every
phase
of
our
relations
with
other
countries
we
cannot
escape
the
responsibility
which
it
thrusts
upon
us
what
we
think
plan
say
and
do
is
of
profound
significance
to
the
future
of
every
corner
of
the
world
the
great
and
dominant
objective
of
united
states
foreign
policy
is
to
build
and
preserve
a
just
peace
the
peace
we
seek
is
not
peace
for
twenty
years
it
is
permanent
peace
at
a
time
when
massive
changes
are
occurring
with
lightning
speed
throughout
the
world
it
is
often
difficult
to
perceive
how
this
central
objective
is
best
served
in
one
isolated
complex
situation
or
another
despite
this
very
real
difficulty
there
are
certain
basic
propositions
to
which
the
united
states
adheres
and
to
which
we
shall
continue
to
adhere
one
proposition
is
that
lasting
peace
requires
genuine
understanding
and
active
cooperation
among
the
most
powerful
nations
another
is
that
even
the
support
of
the
strongest
nations
cannot
guarantee
a
peace
unless
it
is
infused
with
the
quality
of
justice
for
all
nations
on
october
i
made
in
new
york
city
the
following
public
statement
of
my
understanding
of
the
fundamental
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
i
believe
that
policy
to
be
in
accord
with
the
opinion
of
the
congress
and
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
believe
that
that
policy
carries
out
our
fundamental
objectives
we
seek
no
territorial
expansion
or
selfish
advantage
we
have
no
plans
for
aggression
against
any
other
state
large
or
small
we
have
no
objective
which
need
clash
with
the
peaceful
aims
of
any
other
nation
we
believe
in
the
eventual
return
of
sovereign
rights
and
selfgovernment
to
all
peoples
who
have
been
deprived
of
them
by
force
we
shall
approve
no
territorial
changes
in
any
friendly
part
of
the
world
unless
they
accord
with
the
freely
expressed
wishes
of
the
people
concerned
we
believe
that
all
peoples
who
are
prepared
for
selfgovernment
should
be
permitted
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
by
their
own
freely
expressed
choice
without
interference
from
any
foreign
source
that
is
true
in
europe
in
asia
in
africa
as
well
as
in
the
western
hemisphere
by
the
combined
and
cooperative
action
of
our
war
allies
we
shall
help
the
defeated
enemy
states
establish
peaceful
democratic
governments
of
their
own
free
choice
and
we
shall
try
to
attain
a
world
in
which
nazism
fascism
and
military
aggression
cannot
exist
we
shall
refuse
to
recognize
any
government
imposed
upon
any
nation
by
the
force
of
any
foreign
power
in
some
cases
it
may
be
impossible
to
prevent
forceful
imposition
of
such
a
government
but
the
united
states
will
not
recognize
any
such
government
we
believe
that
all
nations
should
have
the
freedom
of
the
seas
and
equal
rights
to
the
navigation
of
boundary
rivers
and
waterways
and
of
rivers
and
waterways
which
pass
through
more
than
one
country
we
believe
that
all
states
which
are
accepted
in
the
society
of
nations
should
have
access
on
equal
terms
to
the
trade
and
the
raw
materials
of
the
world
we
believe
that
the
sovereign
states
of
the
western
hemisphere
without
interference
from
outside
the
western
hemisphere
must
work
together
as
good
neighbors
in
the
solution
of
their
common
problems
we
believe
that
full
economic
collaboration
between
all
nations
great
and
small
is
essential
to
the
improvement
of
living
conditions
all
over
the
world
and
to
the
establishment
of
freedom
from
fear
and
freedom
from
want
we
shall
continue
to
strive
to
promote
freedom
of
expression
and
freedom
of
religion
throughout
the
peaceloving
areas
of
the
world
we
are
convinced
that
the
preservation
of
peace
between
nations
requires
a
united
nations
organization
composed
of
all
the
peaceloving
nations
of
the
world
who
are
willing
jointly
to
use
force
if
necessary
to
insure
peace
that
is
our
foreign
policy
we
may
not
always
fully
succeed
in
our
objectives
there
may
be
instances
where
the
attainment
of
those
objectives
is
delayed
but
we
will
not
give
our
full
sanction
and
approval
to
actions
which
fly
in
the
face
of
these
ideals
the
world
has
a
great
stake
in
the
political
and
economic
future
of
germany
the
allied
control
council
has
now
been
in
operation
there
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
it
has
not
met
with
unqualified
success
the
accommodation
of
varying
views
of
four
governments
in
the
daytoday
civil
administration
of
occupied
territory
is
a
challenging
task
in
my
judgment
however
the
council
has
made
encouraging
progress
in
the
face
of
most
serious
difficulties
it
is
my
purpose
at
the
earliest
practicable
date
to
transfer
from
military
to
civilian
personnel
the
execution
of
united
states
participation
in
the
government
of
occupied
territory
in
europe
we
are
determined
that
effective
control
shall
be
maintained
in
germany
until
we
are
satisfied
that
the
german
people
have
regained
the
right
to
a
place
of
honor
and
respect
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
a
method
of
international
cooperation
has
recently
been
agreed
upon
for
the
treatment
of
japan
in
this
pattern
of
control
the
united
states
with
the
full
approval
of
its
partners
has
retained
primary
authority
and
primary
responsibility
it
will
continue
to
do
so
until
the
japanese
people
by
their
own
freely
expressed
choice
choose
their
own
form
of
government
our
basic
policy
in
the
far
east
is
to
encourage
the
development
of
a
strong
independent
united
and
democratic
china
that
has
been
the
traditional
policy
of
the
united
states
at
moscow
the
united
states
the
union
of
soviet
socialist
republics
and
great
britain
agreed
to
further
this
development
by
supporting
the
efforts
of
the
national
government
and
nongovernmental
chinese
political
elements
in
bringing
about
cessation
of
civil
strife
and
in
broadening
the
basis
of
representation
in
the
government
that
is
the
policy
which
general
marshall
is
so
ably
executing
today
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
proceed
as
rapidly
as
is
practicable
toward
the
restoration
of
the
sovereignty
of
korea
and
the
establishment
of
a
democratic
government
by
the
free
choice
of
the
people
of
korea
at
the
threshold
of
every
problem
which
confronts
us
today
in
international
affairs
is
the
appalling
devastation
hunger
sickness
and
pervasive
human
misery
that
mark
so
many
areas
of
the
world
by
joining
and
participating
in
the
work
of
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
the
united
states
has
directly
recognized
and
assumed
an
obligation
to
give
such
relief
assistance
as
is
practicable
to
millions
of
innocent
and
helpless
victims
of
the
war
the
congress
has
earned
the
gratitude
of
the
world
by
generous
financial
contributions
to
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
we
have
taken
the
lead
modest
though
it
is
in
facilitating
under
our
existing
immigration
quotas
the
admission
to
the
united
states
of
refugees
and
displaced
persons
from
europe
we
have
joined
with
great
britain
in
the
organization
of
a
commission
to
study
the
problem
of
palestine
the
commission
is
already
at
work
and
its
recommendations
will
be
made
at
an
early
date
the
members
of
the
united
nations
have
paid
us
the
high
compliment
of
choosing
the
united
states
as
the
site
of
the
united
nations
headquarters
we
shall
be
host
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
fact
for
nowhere
does
there
abide
a
fiercer
determination
that
this
peace
shall
live
than
in
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
it
is
the
hope
of
all
americans
that
in
time
future
historians
will
speak
not
of
world
war
i
and
world
war
ii
but
of
the
first
and
last
world
wars
foreign
economic
policy
the
foreign
economic
policy
of
the
united
states
is
designed
to
promote
our
own
prosperity
and
at
the
same
time
to
aid
in
the
restoration
and
expansion
of
world
markets
and
to
contribute
thereby
to
world
peace
and
world
security
we
shall
continue
our
efforts
to
provide
relief
from
the
devastation
of
war
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
displaced
persons
to
assist
in
reconstruction
and
development
and
to
promote
the
expansion
of
world
trade
we
have
already
joined
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
international
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
we
have
expanded
the
exportimport
bank
and
provided
it
with
additional
capital
the
congress
has
renewed
the
trade
agreements
act
which
provides
the
necessary
framework
within
which
to
negotiate
a
reduction
of
trade
barriers
on
a
reciprocal
basis
it
has
given
our
support
to
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
in
accordance
with
the
intentions
of
the
congress
lendlease
except
as
to
continuing
military
lendlease
in
china
was
terminated
upon
the
surrender
of
japan
the
first
of
the
lendlease
settlement
agreements
has
been
completed
with
the
united
kingdom
negotiations
with
other
lendlease
countries
are
in
progress
in
negotiating
these
agreements
we
intend
to
seek
settlements
which
will
not
encumber
world
trade
through
war
debts
of
a
character
that
proved
to
be
so
detrimental
to
the
stability
of
the
world
economy
after
the
last
war
we
have
taken
steps
to
dispose
of
the
goods
which
on
vjday
were
in
the
lendlease
pipe
line
to
the
various
lendlease
countries
and
to
allow
them
longterm
credit
for
the
purpose
where
necessary
we
are
also
making
arrangements
under
which
those
countries
may
use
the
lendlease
inventories
in
their
possession
and
acquire
surplus
property
abroad
to
assist
in
their
economic
rehabilitation
and
reconstruction
these
goods
will
be
accounted
for
at
fair
values
the
proposed
loan
to
the
united
kingdom
which
i
shall
recommend
to
the
congress
in
a
separate
message
will
contribute
to
easing
the
transition
problem
of
one
of
our
major
partners
in
the
war
it
will
enable
the
whole
sterling
area
and
other
countries
affiliated
with
it
to
resume
trade
on
a
multilateral
basis
extension
of
this
credit
will
enable
t
he
united
kingdom
to
avoid
discriminatory
trade
arrangements
of
the
type
which
destroyed
freedom
of
trade
during
the
s
i
consider
the
progress
toward
multilateral
trade
which
will
be
achieved
by
this
agreement
to
be
in
itself
sufficient
warrant
for
the
credit
the
view
of
this
government
is
that
in
the
longer
run
our
economic
prosperity
and
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
world
are
best
served
by
the
elimination
of
artificial
barriers
to
international
trade
whether
in
the
form
of
unreasonable
tariffs
or
tariff
preferences
or
commercial
quotas
or
embargoes
or
the
restrictive
practices
of
cartels
the
united
states
government
has
issued
proposals
for
the
expansion
of
world
trade
and
employment
to
which
the
government
of
the
united
kingdom
has
given
its
support
on
every
important
issue
these
proposals
are
intended
to
form
the
basis
for
a
trade
and
employment
conference
to
be
held
in
the
middle
of
this
year
if
that
conference
is
a
success
i
feel
confident
that
the
way
will
have
been
adequately
prepared
for
an
expanded
and
prosperous
world
trade
we
shall
also
continue
negotiations
looking
to
the
full
and
equitable
development
of
facilities
for
transportation
and
communications
among
nations
the
vast
majority
of
the
nations
of
the
world
have
chosen
to
work
together
to
achieve
on
a
cooperative
basis
world
security
and
world
prosperity
the
effort
cannot
succeed
without
full
cooperation
of
the
united
states
to
play
our
part
we
must
not
only
resolutely
carry
out
the
foreign
policies
we
have
adopted
but
also
follow
a
domestic
policy
which
will
maintain
full
production
and
employment
in
the
united
states
a
serious
depression
here
can
disrupt
the
whole
fabric
of
the
world
economy
occupied
countries
the
major
tasks
of
our
military
establishment
in
europe
following
veday
and
in
the
pacific
since
the
surrender
of
japan
have
been
those
of
occupation
and
military
government
in
addition
we
have
given
much
needed
aid
to
the
peoples
of
the
liberated
countries
the
end
of
the
war
in
europe
found
germany
in
a
chaotic
condition
organized
government
had
ceased
to
exist
transportation
systems
had
been
wrecked
cities
and
industrial
facilities
had
been
bombed
into
ruins
in
addition
to
the
tasks
of
occupation
we
had
to
assume
all
of
the
functions
of
government
great
progress
has
been
made
in
the
repatriation
of
displaced
persons
and
of
prisoners
of
war
of
the
total
of
displaced
persons
found
in
the

only
now
remain
the
extensive
complications
involved
by
the
requirement
of
dealing
with
three
other
governments
engaged
in
occupation
and
with
the
governments
of
liberated
countries
require
intensive
work
and
energetic
cooperation
the
influx
of
some
million
german
refugees
into
our
zone
of
occupation
is
a
pressing
problem
making
exacting
demands
upon
an
already
overstrained
internal
economy
improvements
in
the
european
economy
during
have
made
it
possible
for
our
military
authorities
to
relinquish
to
the

of
all

or
to

relief
and

the
responsibility
for
the

of

the
armys
responsibilities
in
europe
extend
now
only
to
our
zones
of
occupation
in
germany
and
austria
and
to
two
small
areas
in
northern
italy
by
contrast
with
germany
in
japan
we
have
occupied
a
country
still
possessing
an
organized
and
operating
governmental
system
although
severely
damaged
the
japanese
industrial
and
transportation
systems
have
been
able
to
insure
at
least
a
survival
existence
for
the
population
the
repatriation
of
japanese
military
and
civilian
personnel
from
overseas
is
proceeding
as
rapidly
as
shipping
and
other
means
permit
in
order
to
insure
that
neither
germany
nor
japan
will
again
be
in
a
position
to
wage
aggressive
warfare
the
armament
making
potential
of
these
countries
is
being
dismantled
and
fundamental
changes
in
their
social
and
political
structures
are
being
effected
democratic
systems
are
being
fostered
to
the
end
that
the
voice
of
the
common
man
may
be
heard
in
the
councils
of
his
government
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
legal
culpability
of
war
makers
is
being
determined
the
trials
now
in
progress
in
nurnbergand
those
soon
to
begin
in
tokyobring
before
the
bar
of
international
justice
those
individuals
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
the
sufferings
of
the
past
six
years
we
have
high
hope
that
this
public
portrayal
of
the
guilt
of
these
evildoers
will
bring
wholesale
and
permanent
revulsion
on
the
part
of
the
masses
of
our
former
enemies
against
war
militarism
aggression
and
notions
of
race
superiority
demobilization
of
our
armed
forces
the
cessation
of
active
campaigning
does
not
mean
that
we
can
completely
disband
our
fighting
forces
for
their
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
their
loved
ones
at
home
i
wish
that
we
could
but
we
still
have
the
task
of
clinching
the
victories
we
have
wonof
making
certain
that
germany
and
japan
can
never
again
wage
aggressive
warfare
that
they
will
not
again
have
the
means
to
bring
on
another
world
war
the
performance
of
that
task
requires
that
together
with
our
allies
we
occupy
the
hostile
areas
complete
the
disarmament
of
our
enemies
and
take
the
necessary
measures
to
see
to
it
that
they
do
not
rearm
as
quickly
as
possible
we
are
bringing
about
the
reduction
of
our
armed
services
to
the
size
required
for
these
tasks
of
occupation
and
disarmament
the
army
and
the
navy
are
following
both
lengthofservice
and
point
systems
as
far
as
possible
in
releasing
men
and
women
from
the
service
the
points
are
based
chiefly
on
length
and
character
of
service
and
on
the
existence
of
dependents
over
million
from
the
army
have
already
passed
through
the
separation
centers
the
navy
including
the
marine
corps
and
the
coast
guard
has
discharged
over
one
and
a
half
million
of
the
million
men
and
women
serving
in
the
army
and
navy
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
of
germany
onehalf
have
already
been
released
the
greater
part
of
these
had
to
be
brought
back
to
this
country
from
distant
parts
of
the
world
of
course
there
are
cases
of
individual
hardship
in
retention
of
personnel
in
the
service
there
will
be
in
the
future
no
system
of
such
size
can
operate
to
perfection
but
the
systems
are
rounded
on
fairness
and
justice
and
they
are
working
at
full
speed
we
shall
try
to
avoid
mistakes
injustices
and
hardshipas
far
as
humanly
possible
we
have
already
reached
the
point
where
shipping
is
no
longer
the
bottleneck
in
the
return
of
troops
from
the
european
theater
the
governing
factor
now
has
become
the
requirement
for
troops
in
sufficient
strength
to
carry
out
their
missions
in
a
few
months
the
same
situation
will
exist
in
the
pacific
by
the
end
of
june
out
of
who
were
serving
in
the
armed
forces
on
veday
will
have
been
released
demobilization
will
continue
thereafter
but
at
a
slower
rate
determined
by
our
military
responsibilities
our
national
safety
and
the
security
of
the
world
will
require
substantial
armed
forces
particularly
in
overseas
service
at
the
same
time
it
is
imperative
that
we
relieve
those
who
have
already
done
their
duty
and
that
we
relieve
them
as
fast
as
we
can
to
do
that
the
army
and
the
navy
are
conducting
recruiting
drives
with
considerable
success
the
army
has
obtained
nearly
volunteers
in
the
past
four
months
and
the
navy
has
obtained
eighty
percent
of
these
volunteers
for
the
regular
service
have
come
from
those
already
with
the
colors
the
congress
has
made
it
possible
to
offer
valuable
inducements
to
those
who
are
eligible
for
enlistment
every
effort
will
be
made
to
enlist
the
required
number
of
young
men
the
war
and
navy
departments
now
estimate
that
by
a
year
from
now
we
still
will
need
a
strength
of
about
million
including
officers
for
the
armed
forcesarmy
navy
and
air
i
have
reviewed
their
estimates
and
believe
that
the
safety
of
the
nation
will
require
the
maintenance
of
an
armed
strength
of
this
size
for
the
calendar
year
that
is
before
us
in
case
the
campaign
for
volunteers
does
not
produce
that
number
it
will
be
necessary
by
additional
legislation
to
extend
the
selective
service
act
beyond
may
the
date
of
expiration
under
existing
law
that
is
the
only
way
we
can
get
the
men
and
bring
back
our
veterans
there
is
no
other
way
action
along
this
line
should
not
be
postponed
beyond
march
in
order
to
avoid
uncertainty
and
disruption
domestic
affairs
i
the
economic
outlook
prophets
of
doom
predicted
that
the
united
states
could
not
escape
a
runaway
inflation
during
the
war
and
an
economic
collapse
after
the
war
these
predictions
have
not
been
borne
out
on
the
contrary
the
record
of
economic
stabilization
during
the
war
and
during
the
period
of
reconversion
has
been
an
outstanding
accomplishment
we
know
however
that
nothing
is
as
dangerous
as
overconfidence
in
war
or
in
peace
we
have
had
to
fight
hard
to
hold
the
line
we
have
made
strenuous
efforts
to
speed
reconversion
but
neither
the
danger
of
a
postwar
inflation
nor
of
a
subsequent
collapse
in
production
and
employment
is
yet
overcome
we
must
base
our
policies
not
on
unreasoning
optimism
or
pessimism
but
upon
a
candid
recognition
of
our
objectives
and
upon
a
careful
analysis
of
foreseeable
trends
any
precise
appraisal
of
the
economic
outlook
at
this
time
is
particularly
difficult
the
period
of
demobilization
and
reconversion
is
fraught
with
uncertainties
there
are
also
serious
gaps
in
our
statistical
information
certain
tendencies
are
however
fairly
clear
and
recognition
of
them
should
serve
as
background
for
the
consideration
of
next
years
federal
program
in
general
the
outlook
for
business
is
good
and
it
is
likely
to
continue
to
be
goodprovided
we
control
inflation
and
achieve
peace
in
management
labor
relations
civilian
production
and
employment
can
be
expected
to
increase
throughout
the
next
year
this
does
not
mean
however
that
continuing
full
employment
is
assured
it
is
probable
that
demobilization
of
the
armed
forces
will
proceed
faster
than
the
increase
in
civilian
employment
opportunities
even
if
substantial
further
withdr
awals
from
the
labor
market
occur
unemployment
will
increase
temporarily
the
extent
to
which
this
unemployment
will
persist
depends
largely
on
the
speed
of
industrial
expansion
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
along
with
extraordinary
demand
there
are
still
at
this
time
many
critical
shortages
resulting
from
the
war
these
extraordinary
demands
and
shortages
may
lead
to
a
speculative
boom
especially
in
the
price
of
securities
real
estate
and
inventories
therefore
our
chief
worry
still
is
inflation
while
we
control
this
inflationary
pressure
we
must
look
forward
to
the
time
when
this
extraordinary
demand
will
subside
it
will
be
years
before
we
catch
up
with
the
demand
for
housing
the
extraordinary
demand
for
other
durable
goods
for
the
replenishment
of
inventories
and
for
exports
may
be
satisfied
earlier
no
backlog
of
demand
can
exist
very
long
in
the
face
of
our
tremendous
productive
capacity
we
must
expect
again
to
face
the
problem
of
shrinking
demand
and
consequent
slackening
in
sales
production
and
employment
this
possibility
of
a
deflationary
spiral
in
the
future
will
exist
unless
we
now
plan
and
adopt
an
effective
full
employment
program
general
policiesimmediate
and
longrange
during
the
war
production
for
civilian
use
was
limited
by
war
needs
and
available
manpower
economic
stabilization
required
measures
to
spread
limited
supplies
equitably
by
rationing
price
controls
increased
taxes
savings
bond
campaigns
and
credit
controls
now
with
the
surrender
of
our
enemies
economic
stabilization
requires
that
policies
be
directed
toward
promoting
an
increase
in
supplies
at
low
unit
prices
we
must
encourage
the
development
of
resources
and
enterprises
in
all
parts
of
the
country
particularly
in
underdeveloped
areas
for
example
the
establishment
of
new
peacetime
industries
in
the
western
states
and
in
the
south
would
in
my
judgment
add
to
existing
production
and
markets
rather
than
merely
bring
about
a
shifting
of
production
i
am
asking
the
secretaries
of
agriculture
commerce
and
labor
to
explore
jointly
methods
for
stimulating
new
industries
particularly
in
areas
with
surplus
agricultural
labor
we
must
also
aid
small
businessmen
and
particularly
veterans
who
are
competent
to
start
their
own
businesses
the
establishment
and
development
of
efficient
small
business
ventures
i
believe
will
not
take
away
from
but
rather
will
add
to
the
total
business
of
all
enterprises
even
with
maximum
encouragement
of
production
we
cannot
hope
to
remove
scarcities
within
a
short
time
the
most
serious
deficiencies
will
persist
in
the
fields
of
residential
housing
building
materials
and
consumers
durable
goods
the
critical
situation
makes
continued
rent
control
price
control
and
priorities
allocations
and
inventory
controls
absolutely
essential
continued
control
of
consumer
credit
will
help
to
reduce
the
pressure
on
prices
of
durable
goods
and
will
also
prolong
the
period
during
which
the
backlog
demand
will
be
effective
while
we
are
meeting
these
immediate
needs
we
must
look
forward
to
a
longrange
program
of
security
and
increased
standard
of
living
the
best
protection
of
purchasing
power
is
a
policy
of
full
production
and
full
employment
opportunities
obviously
an
employed
worker
is
a
better
customer
than
an
unemployed
worker
there
always
will
be
however
some
frictional
unemployment
in
the
present
period
of
transition
we
must
deal
with
such
temporary
unemployment
as
results
from
the
fact
that
demobilization
will
proceed
faster
than
reconversion
or
industrial
expansion
such
temporary
unemployment
is
probably
unavoidable
in
a
period
of
rapid
change
the
unemployed
worker
is
a
victim
of
conditions
beyond
his
control
he
should
be
enabled
to
maintain
a
reasonable
standard
of
living
for
himself
and
his
family
the
most
serious
difficulty
in
the
path
of
reconversion
and
expansion
is
the
establishment
of
a
fair
wage
structure
the
ability
of
labor
and
management
to
work
together
and
the
wage
and
price
policies
which
they
develop
are
social
and
economic
issues
of
first
importance
both
labor
and
management
have
a
special
interest
labors
interest
is
very
direct
and
personal
because
working
conditions
wages
and
prices
affect
the
very
life
and
happiness
of
the
worker
and
his
family
management
has
a
no
less
direct
interest
because
on
management
rests
the
responsibility
for
conducting
a
growing
and
prosperous
business
but
management
and
labor
have
identical
interests
in
the
long
run
good
wages
mean
good
markets
good
business
means
more
jobs
and
better
wages
in
this
age
of
cooperation
and
in
our
highly
organized
economy
the
problems
of
one
very
soon
become
the
problems
of
all
better
human
relationships
are
an
urgent
need
to
which
organized
labor
and
management
should
address
themselves
no
government
policy
can
make
men
understand
each
other
agree
and
get
along
unless
they
conduct
themselves
in
a
way
to
foster
mutual
respect
and
good
will
the
government
can
however
help
to
develop
machinery
which
with
the
backing
of
public
opinion
will
assist
labor
and
management
to
resolve
their
disagreements
in
a
peaceful
manner
and
reduce
the
number
and
duration
of
strikes
all
of
us
realize
that
productivityincreased
output
per
manis
in
the
long
run
the
basis
of
our
standard
of
living
management
especially
must
realize
that
if
labor
is
to
work
wholeheartedly
for
an
increase
in
production
workers
must
be
given
a
just
share
of
increased
output
in
higher
wages
most
industries
and
most
companies
have
adequate
leeway
within
which
to
grant
substantial
wage
increases
these
increases
will
have
a
direct
effect
in
increasing
consumer
demand
to
the
high
levels
needed
substantial
wage
increases
are
good
business
for
business
because
they
assure
a
large
market
for
their
products
substantial
wage
increases
are
good
business
for
labor
because
they
increase
labors
standard
of
living
substantial
wage
increases
are
good
business
for
the
country
as
a
whole
because
capacity
production
means
an
active
healthy
friendly
citizenry
enjoying
the
benefits
of
democracy
under
our
free
enterprise
system
labor
and
management
in
many
industries
have
been
operating
successfully
under

governments

upward
revisions
of
wage
scales
have
been
made
in
thousands
of
establishments
throughout
the
nation
since
vjday
it
is
estimated
that
about
million
workers
or
more
than
percent
of
all
employees
in
nonagricultural
and
nongovernmental
establishments
have
received
wage
increases
since
august
the
amounts
of
increases
given
by
individual
employers
concentrate
between
and

but
range
from
less
than

to
over
percent
the

since
vjday
has
settled
over

over
workers
without
a
strike
threat
and
has
assisted
in
settling
about
disputes
where

were
threatened
which
involved
about

only
workers
directly
involved
and
not
those
in

who
might
have
been
indirectly

are
included
in
these
estimates
many
of
these

have
occurred
in
key
industries
and
would
have
seemed
to
us
major
crises
if
they
had
not
been
settled
peaceably
within
the
framework
of
the
wageprice
policy
there
has
been
definite
success
and
it
is
to
be
expected
that
this
success
will
continue
in
a
vast
majority
of
the
cases
arising
in
the
months
ahead
however
everyone
who
realizes
the
extreme
need
for
a
swift
and
orderly
reconversion
must
feel
a
deep
concern
about
the
number
of
major
strikes
now
in
progress
if
long
continued
these
strikes
could
put
a
heavy
brake
on
our
program
i
have
already
made
recommendations
to
the
congress
as
to
the
procedure
best
adapted
to
meeting
the
threat
of
work
stoppages
in
nationwide
industries
without
sacrificing
the
fundamental
rights
of
labor
to
bargain
collectively
and
ultimately
to
strike
in
support
of
their
position
if
we
manage
our
economy
properly
the
future
will
see
us
on
a
level
of
production
half
again
as
high
as
anything
we
have
ever
accomplished
in
peacetime
business
can
in
the
future
pay
higher
wages
and
sell
for
lower
prices
than
ever
before
this
is
not
true
now
for
all
companies
nor
will
it
ever
be
true
for
all
but
for
business
generally
it
is
true
we
are
relying
on
all
concerned
to
develop
through
collective
bargaining
wage
structures
that
are
fair
to
labor
allow
for
necessary
business
incentives
and
conform
with
a
policy
designed
to
hold
the
line
on
prices
production
and
more
production
was
the
byword
during
the
war
and
still
is
during
the
transition
from
war
to
peace
however
when
deferred
demand
slackens
we
shall
once
again
face
the
deflationary
dangers
which
beset
this
and
other
countries
during
the
s
prosperity
can
be
assured
only
by
a
high
level
of
demand
supported
by
high
current
income
it
cannot
be
sustained
by
deferred
needs
and
use
of
accumulated
savings
if
we
take
the
right
steps
in
time
we
can
certainly
avoid
the
disastrous
excesses
of
runaway
booms
and
headlong
depressions
we
must
not
let
a
year
or
two
of
prosperity
lull
us
into
a
false
feeling
of
security
and
a
repetition
of
the
mistakes
of
the
s
that
culminated
in
the
crash
of
during
the
year
ahead
the
government
will
be
called
upon
to
act
in
many
important
fields
of
economic
policy
from
taxation
and
foreign
trade
to
social
security
and
housing
in
every
case
there
will
be
alternatives
we
must
choose
the
alternatives
which
will
best
measure
up
to
our
need
for
maintaining
production
and
employment
in
the
future
we
must
never
lose
sight
of
our
longterm
objectives
the
broadening
of
marketsthe
maintenance
of
steadily
rising
demand
this
demand
can
come
from
only
three
sources
consumers
businesses
or
government
in
this
country
the
job
of
production
and
distribution
is
in
the
hands
of
businessmen
farmers
workers
and
professional
peoplein
the
hands
of
our
citizens
we
want
to
keep
it
that
way
however
it
is
the
governments
responsibility
to
help
business
labor
and
farmers
do
their
jobs
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
government
acting
on
behalf
of
all
the
people
must
assume
the
ultimate
respons
ibility
for
the
economic
health
of
the
nation
there
is
no
other
agency
that
can
no
other
organization
has
the
scope
or
the
authority
nor
is
any
other
agency
accountable
to
all
the
people
this
does
not
mean
that
the
government
has
the
sole
responsibility
nor
that
it
can
do
the
job
alone
nor
that
it
can
do
the
job
directly
all
of
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
must
be
geared
to
the
objective
of
sustained
full
production
and
full
employmentto
raise
consumer
purchasing
power
and
to
encourage
business
investment
the
programs
we
adopt
this
year
and
from
now
on
will
determine
our
ability
to
achieve
our
objectives
we
must
continue
to
pay
particular
attention
to
our
fiscal
monetary
and
tax
policy
programs
to
aid
businessespecially
small

transportation

social

and

for

the
kinds
of
tax
measures
we
have
at
different
timeswhether
we
raise
our
revenue
in
a
way
to
encourage
consumer
spending
and
business
investment
or
to
discourage
ithave
a
vital
bearing
on
this
question
it
is
affected
also
by
regulations
on
consumer
credit
and
by
the
money
market
which
is
strongly
influenced
by
the
rate
of
interest
on
government
securities
it
is
affected
by
almost
every
step
we
take
in

the
way
we
handle
the
proper
functions
of
government
the
way

time
the
exercise
of
our
traditional
and
legitimate
governmental
functions
has
a
vital
bearing
on
the
economic
health
of
the
nation
these
policies
are
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
the
accompanying
fifth
quarterly
report
of
the
director
of
war
mobilization
and
reconversion
legislation
heretofore
recommended
and
still
pending
to
attain
some
of
these
objectives
and
to
meet
the
other
needs
of
the
united
states
in
the
reconversion
and
postwar
period
i
have
from
time
to
time
made
various
recommendations
to
the
congress
in
making
these
recommendations
i
have
indicated
the
reasons
why
i
deemed
them
essential
for
progress
at
home
and
abroad
a

very

these
recommendations
have

not

others

today
inflation
is
our
greatest
immediate
domestic
problem
so
far
the
fight
against
inflation
has
been
waged
successfully
since
may
following
president
roosevelts
hold
the
line
order
and
in
the
face
of
the
greatest
pressures
which
this
country
has
ever
seen
the
cost
of
living
index
has
risen
only
three
percent
wholesale
prices
in
this
same
period
have
been
held
to
an
increase
of
two
and
onehalf
percent
this
record
has
been
made
possible
by
the
vigorous
efforts
of
the
agencies
responsible
for
this
program
but
their
efforts
would
have
been
fruitless
if
they
had
not
had
the
solid
support
of
the
great
masses
of
our
people
the
congress
is
to
be
congratulated
for
its
role
in
providing
the
legislation
under
which
this
work
has
been
carried
out
on
vjday
it
was
clear
to
all
thinking
people
that
the
danger
of
inflation
was
by
no
means
over
many
of
us
can
remember
vividly
our
disastrous
experience
following
world
war
i
then
the
very
restricted
wartime
controls
were
lifted
too
quickly
and
as
a
result
prices
and
rents
moved
more
rapidly
upward
in
the
year
and
a
half
following
the
armistice
rents
food
and
clothing
shot
to
higher
and
still
higher
levels
when
the
inevitable
crash
occurred
less
than
two
years
after
the
end
of
the
war
business
bankruptcies
were
widespread
profits
were
wiped
out
inventory
losses
amounted
to
billions
of
dollars
farm
income
dropped
by
onehalf
factory
pay
rolls
dropped
percent
and
nearly
onefifth
of
all
our
industrial
workers
were
walking
the
streets
in
search
of
jobs
this
was
a
grim
greeting
indeed
to
offer
our
veterans
who
had
just
returned
from
overseas
when
i
addressed
the
congress
in
september
i
emphasized
that
we
must
continue
to
hold
the
price
line
until
the
production
of
goods
caught
up
with
the
tremendous
demands
since
then
we
have
seen
demonstrated
the
strength
of
the
inflationary
pressures
which
we
have
to
face
retail
sales
in
the
closing
months
of
ran
percent
above
the
previous
peak
for
that
season
which
came
in
prices
throughout
the
entire
economy
have
been
pressing
hard
against
the
price
ceilings
the
prices
of
real
estate
which
cannot
now
be
controlled
under
the
law
are
rising
rapidly
commercial
rents
are
not
included
in
the
present
price
control
law
and
where
they
are
not
controlled
by
state
law
have
been
increasing
causing
difficulties
to
many
businessmen
it
will
be
impossible
to
maintain
a
high
purchasing
power
or
an
expanding
production
unless
we
can
keep
prices
at
levels
which
can
be
met
by
the
vast
majority
of
our
people
full
production
is
the
greatest
weapon
against
inflation
but
until
we
can
produce
enough
goods
to
meet
the
threat
of
inflation
the
government
will
have
to
exercise
its
wartime
control
over
prices
i
am
sure
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
disturbed
by
the
demands
made
by
several
business
groups
with
regard
to
price
and
rent
control
i
am
particularly
disturbed
at
the
effect
such
thinking
may
have
on
production
and
employment
if
manufacturers
continue
to
hold
back
goods
and
decline
to
submit
bids
when
invitedas
i
am
informed
some
are
doingin
anticipation
of
higher
prices
which
would
follow
the
end
of
price
controls
we
shall
inevitably
slow
down
production
and
create
needless
unemployment
on
the
other
hand
there
are
the
vast
majority
of
american
businessmen
who
are
not
holding
back
goods
but
who
need
certainty
about
the
government
pricing
policy
in
order
to
fix
their
own
longrange
pricing
policies
businessmen
are
entitled
therefore
to
a
dear
statement
of
the
policy
of
the
government
on
the
subject
tenants
and
housewives
farmers
and
workersconsumers
in
generalhave
an
equal
right
we
are
all
anxious
to
eliminate
unnecessary
controls
just
as
rapidly
as
we
can
do
so
the
steps
that
we
have
already
taken
in
many
directions
toward
that
end
are
a
clear
indication
of
our
policy
the
present
price
control
act
expires
on
june
if
we
expect
to
maintain
a
steady
economy
we
shall
have
to
maintain
price
and
rent
control
for
many
months
to
come
the
inflationary
pressures
on
prices
and
rents
with
relatively
few
exceptions
are
now
at
an
alltime
peak
unless
the
price
control
act
is
renewed
there
will
be
no
limit
to
which
our
price
levels
would
soar
our
country
would
face
a
national
disaster
we
cannot
wait
to
renew
the
act
until
immediately
before
it
expires
inflation
results
from
psychological
as
well
as
economic
conditions
the
country
has
a
clear
right
to
know
where
the
congress
stands
on
this
allimportant
problem
any
uncertainty
now
as
to
whether
the
act
will
be
extended
gives
rise
to
price
speculation
to
withholding
of
goods
from
the
market
in
anticipation
of
rising
prices
and
to
delays
in
achieving
maximum
production
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
congress
will
be
beset
by
many
groups
who
will
urge
that
the
legislation
that
i
have
proposed
should
either
be
eliminated
or
modified
to
the
point
where
it
is
nearly
useless
the
congress
has
a
clear
responsibility
to
meet
this
challenge
with
courage
and
determination
i
have
every
confid
ence
that
it
will
do
so
i
strongly
urge
that
the
congress
now
resolve
all
doubts
and
as
soon
as
possible
adopt
legislation
continuing
rent
and
price
control
in
effect
for
a
full
year
from
june
b
food
subsidies
if
the
price
line
is
to
be
held
if
our
people
are
to
be
protected
against
the
inflationary
dangers
which
confront
us
we
must
do
more
than
extend
the
price
control
act
in
september
we
were
hopeful
that
the
inflationary
pressures
would
by
this
time
have
begun
to
diminish
we
were
particularly
hopeful
on
food
indeed
it
was
estimated
that
food
prices
at
retail
would
drop
from
to
percent
in
the
first
six
months
following
the
end
of
the
war
in
anticipation
of
this
decline
in
food
prices
it
was
our
belief
that
food
subsidies
could
be
removed
gradually
during
the
winter
and
spring
months
and
eliminated
almost
completely
by
june
of
this
year
it
was
our
feeling
that
the
food
subsidies
could
be
dropped
without
an
increase
to
the
consumer
in
the
present
level
of
food
prices
or
in
the
overall
cost
of
living
as
matters
stand
today
however
food
prices
are
pressing
hard
against
the
ceilings
the
expected
decline
in
food
prices
has
not
occurred
nor
is
it
likely
to
occur
for
many
months
to
come
this
brings
me
to
the
reluctant
conclusion
that
food
subsidies
must
be
continued
beyond
june
if
we
fail
to
take
this
necessary
step
meat
prices
on
july
will
be
from
to
cents
higher
than
their
average
present
levels
butter
will
be
at
least
cents
a
pound
higher
in
addition
to
the
cents
a
pound
increase
of
last
fall
milk
will
increase
from
to
cents
a
quart
bread
will
increase
about
cent
a
loaf
sugar
will
increase
over
cent
a
pound
cheese
in
addition
to
the
increase
of
cents
now
planned
for
the
latter
part
of
this
month
will
go
up
an
additional
cents
in
terms
of
percentages
we
may
find
the
costofliving
index
for
food
increased
by
more
than
percent
which
in
turn
would
result
in
more
than
a
percent
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
if
prices
of
food
were
allowed
to
increase
by
these
amounts
i
must
make
it
clear
to
the
congress
that
in
my
opinion
it
would
become
extremely
difficult
for
us
to
control
the
forces
of
inflation
none
of
us
likes
subsidies
our
farmers
in
particular
have
always
been
opposed
to
them
but
i
believe
our
farmers
are
as
deeply
conscious
as
any
group
in
the
land
of
the
havoc
which
inflation
can
create
certainly
in
the
past
eighteen
months
there
has
been
no
group
which
has
fought
any
harder
in
support
of
the
governments
price
control
program
i
am
confident
that
if
the
facts
are
placed
before
them
and
if
they
see
clearly
the
evils
between
which
we
are
forced
to
choose
they
will
understand
the
reasons
why
subsidies
must
be
continued
the
legislation
continuing
the
use
of
food
subsidies
into
the
new
fiscal
year
should
be
tied
down
specifically
to
certain
standards
a
very
proper
requirement
in
my
opinion
would
be
that
subsidies
be
removed
as
soon
as
it
is
indicated
that
the
cost
of
living
will
decline
below
the
present
levels
c
extension
of
war
powers
act
the
second
war
powers
act
has
recently
been
extended
by
the
congress
for
six
months
instead
of
for
a
year
it
will
now
expire
unless
further
extended
on
june
this
act
is
the
basis
for
priority
and
inventory
controls
governing
the
use
of
scarce
materials
as
well
as
for
other
powers
essential
to
orderly
reconversion
i
think
that
this
administration
has
given
adequate
proof
of
the
fact
that
it
desires
to
eliminate
wartime
controls
as
quickly
and
as
expeditiously
as
possible
however
we
know
that
there
will
continue
to
be
shortages
of
certain
materials
caused
by
the
war
even
after
june
it
is
important
that
businessmen
know
now
that
materials
in
short
supply
are
going
to
be
controlled
and
distributed
fairly
as
long
as
these
warborn
shortages
continue
i
therefore
urge
the
congress
soon
to
extend
the
second
war
powers
act
we
cannot
afford
to
wait
until
just
before
the
act
expires
next
june
to
wait
would
cause
the
controls
to
break
down
in
a
short
time
and
would
hamper
our
production
and
employment
program
d
small
business
and
competition
a
rising
birth
rate
for
small
business
and
a
favorable
environment
for
its
growth
are
not
only
economic
necessities
but
also
important
practical
demonstrations
of
opportunity
in
a
democratic
free
society
a
great
many
veterans
and
workers
with
new
skills
and
experience
will
want
to
start
in
for
themselves
the
opportunity
must
be
afforded
them
to
do
so
they
are
the
small
businessmen
of
the
future
actually
when
we
talk
about
small
business
we
are
talking
about
almost
all
of
the
nations
individual
businesses
nine
out
of
every
ten
concerns
fall
into
this
category
and
percent
of
all
workers
are
employed
by
them
between
and
percent
of
the
total
value
of
all
business
transactions
are
handled
by
small
business
it
is
obvious
national
policy
to
foster
the
sound
development
of
small
business
it
helps
to
maintain
high
levels
of
employment
and
national
income
and
consumption
of
the
goods
and
services
that
the
nation
can
produce
it
encourages
the
competition
that
keeps
our
free
enterprise
economy
vigorous
and
expanding
small
business
because
of
its
flexibility
assists
in
the
rapid
exploitation
of
scientific
and
technological
discoveries
investment
in
small
business
can
absorb
a
large
volume
of
savings
that
might
otherwise
not
be
tapped
the
government
should
encourage
and
is
encouraging
smallbusiness
initiative
and
originality
to
stimulate
progress
through
competition
during
the
war
the
smaller
war
plants
corporation
assisted
small
concerns
to
make
a
maximum
contribution
to
victory
the
work
of
the
smaller
war
plants
corporation
is
being
carried
on
in
peacetime
by
the
federal
loan
agency
and
the
department
of
commerce
the
fundamental
approach
to
the
job
of
encouraging
small
concerns
must
be
based
on
arrangements
for
making
private
and
public
financial
resources
available
on
reasonable
terms
provision
of
technical
advice
and
assistance
to
business
as
a
whole
on
production
research
and
management
problems
this
will
help
equalize
competitive
relationships
between
large
and
small
companies
for
many
of
the
small
companies
cannot
afford
expensive
technical
research
accounting
and
tax
advice
elimination
of
trade
practices
and
agreements
which
reduce
competition
and
discriminate
against
new
or
small
enterprises
we
speak
a
great
deal
about
the
free
enterprise
economy
of
our
country
it
is
competition
that
keeps
it
free
it
is
competition
that
keeps
it
growing
and
developing
the
truth
is
that
we
need
far
more
competition
in
the
future
than
we
have
had
in
the
immediate
past
by
strangling
competition
monopolistic
activity
prevents
or
deters
investment
in
new
or
expanded
production
facilities
this
lessens
the
opportunity
for
employment
and
chokes
off
new
outlets
for
idle
savings
monopoly
maintains
prices
at
artificially
high
levels
and
reduces
consumption
which
with
lower
prices
would
rise
and
support
larger
production
and
higher
employment
monopoly
not
being
subject
to
competitive
pressure
is
slow
to
take
advantage
of
technical
advances
which
would
lower
prices
or
improve
quality
all
three
of
these
monopolistic
activities
very
directly
lower
the
standard
of
livingthrough
higher
prices
and
lower
quality
of
productwhich
free
competition
would
improve
the
federal
government
must
protect
legitimate
business
and
consumers
from
predatory
and
monopolistic
practices
by
the
vigilant
enforcement
of
regulatory
legislation
the
program
will
be
designed
to
have
a
maximum
impact
upon
monopolistic
bottlenecks
and
unfair
competitive
practices
hindering
expansion
in
employment
during
the
war
enforcement
of
antimonopoly
laws
was
suspended
in
a
number
of
fields
the
government
must
now
take
major
steps
not
only
to
maintain
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws
but
to
encourage
new
and
competing
enterprises
in
every
way
the
deferred
demand
of
the
war
years
and
the
large
accumulations
of
liquid
assets
provide
ample
incentive
for
expansion
equalizing
of
business
opportunity
under
full
and
free
competition
must
be
a
prime
responsibility
in
the
reconversion
period
and
in
the
years
that
follow
many
leading
businessmen
have
recognized
the
importance
of
such
action
both
to
themselves
and
to
the
economy
as
a
whole
but
we
must
do
more
than
break
up
trusts
and
monopolies
after
they
have
begun
to
strangle
competition
we
must
take
positive
action
to
foster
new
expanding
enterprises
by
legislation
and
by
administration
we
must
take
specific
steps
to
discourage
the
formation
or
the
strengthening
of
competitionrestricting
business
we
must
have
an
overall
antimonopoly
policy
which
can
be
applied
by
all
agencies
of
the
government
in
exercising
the
functions
assigned
to
thema
policy
designed
to
encourage
the
formation
and
growth
of
new
and
freely
competitive
enterprises
among
the
many
departments
and
agencies
which
have
parts
in
the
program
affecting
business
and
competition
the
department
of
commerce
has
a
particularly
important
role
that
is
why
i
have
recommended
a
substantial
increase
in
appropriations
for
the
next
fiscal
year
for
this
department
in
its
assistance
to
industry
the
department
of
commerce
will
concentrate
its
efforts
on
these
primary
objectives
promotion
of
a
large
and
wellbalanced
foreign
trade
provision
of
improved
technical
assistance
and
management
aids
especially
for
small
enterprises
and
strengthening
of
basic
statistics
on
business
operations
both
by
industries
and
by
regions
to
make
new
inventions
and
discoveries
available
more
promptly
to
all
businesses
small
and
large
the
department
proposes
to
expand
its
own
research
activities
promote
research
by
universities
improve
patent
office
procedures
and
develop
a
greatly
expanded
system
of
field
offices
readily
accessible
to
the
businesses
they
serve
many
gaps
exist
in
the
private
financial
mechanism
especially
in
the
provision
of
longterm
funds
for
small
and
medium
sized
enterprises
in
the
peacetime
economy
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
will
take
the
leadership
in
assuring
adequate
financing
for
small
enterprises
which
cannot
secure
funds
from
other

sources
most
of
the
funds
should
and
will
be
provided
by
private
lenders
but
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
will
share
any
unusual
risks
through
guarantees
of
private
loans
with
direct
loans
only
when
private
capital
is
unwilling
to
participate
on
a
reasonable
basis
e
minimum
wage
full
employment
and
full
production
may
be
achieved
only
by
maintaining
a
level
of
consumer
income
far
higher
than
that
of
the
prewar
period
a
high
level
of
consumer
income
will
maintain
the
market
for
the
output
of
our
mills
farms
and
factories
which
we
have
demonstrated
during
the
war
years
that
we
can
produce
one
of
the
basic
steps
which
the
congress
can
take
to
establish
a
high
level
of
consumer
income
is
to
amend
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
raise
substandard
wages
to
a
decent
minimum
and
to
extend
similar
protection
to
additional
workers
who
are
not
covered
by
the
present
act
substandard
wages
are
bad
for
business
and
for
the
farmer
substandard
wages
provide
only
a
substandard
market
for
the
goods
and
services
produced
by
american
industry
and
agriculture
at
the
present
time
the
fair
labor
standards
act
prescribes
a
minimum
wage
of
cents
an
hour
for
those
workers
who
are
covered
by
the
act
the
present
minimum
wage
represents
an
annual
income
of
about
to
those
continuously
employed
for
weeksclearly
a
wholly
inadequate
budget
for
an
american
family
i
am
in
full
accord
with
the
proposal
now
pending
in
the
congress
that
the
statutory
minimum
be
raised
immediately
to
cents
an
hour
with
further
increases
to
cents
after
one
year
and
to
cents
after
two
years
i
also
favor
the
proposal
that
the
industry
committee
procedure
be
used
to
set
rates
higher
than
cents
per
hour
during
the
twoyear
interval
before
the
cent
basic
wage
would
otherwise
become
applicable
the
proposed
minimum
wage
of
cents
an
hour
would
assure
the
worker
an
annual
income
of
about
a
year
in
steady
employment
this
amount
is
clearly
a
modest
goal
after
considering
costofliving
increases
in
recent
years
it
is
little
more
than
a
cent
increase
over
the
present
legal
minimum
in
fact
if
any
large
number
of
workers
earn
less
than
this
amount
we
will
find
it
impossible
to
maintain
the
levels
of
purchasing
power
needed
to
sustain
the
stable
prosperity
which
we
desire
raising
the
minimum
to
cents
an
hour
will
provide
the
wage
earner
with
an
annual
income
of
if
he
is
fully
employed
the
proposed
higher
minimum
wage
levels
are
feasible
without
involving
serious
price
adjustments
or
serious
geographic
dislocations
today
about
percent
of
our
manufacturing
wage
earnersor
about
millionearn
less
than
cents
an
hour
because
wages
in
most
industries
have
risen
during
the
war
this
is
about
the
same
as
the
proportion
percentwho
were
earning
less
than
cents
an
hour
in
i
also
recommend
that
minimum
wage
protection
be
extended
to
several
groups
of
workers
not
now
covered
the
need
for
a
decent
standard
of
living
is
by
no
means
limited
to
those
workers
who
happen
to
be
covered
by
the
act
as
it
now
stands
it
is
particularly
vital
at
this
period
of
readjustment
in
the
national
economy
and
readjustment
in
employment
of
labor
to
extend
minimum
wage
protection
as
far
as
possible
lifting
the
basic
minimum
wage
is
necessary
it
is
justified
as
a
matter
of
simple
equity
to
workers
and
it
will
prove
not
only
feasible
but
also
directly
beneficial
to
the
nations
employers
f
agricultural
programs
the
farmers
of
america
generally
are
entering
the
crop
year
of
in
better
financial
condition
than
ever
before
farm
mortgage
debt
is
the
lowest
in
years
farmers
savings
are
the
largest
in
history
our
agricultural
plant
is
in
much
better
condition
than
after
world
war
i
farm
machinery
and
supplies
are
expected
to
be
available
in
larger
volume
and
farm
labor
problems
will
be
less
acute
the
demand
for
farm
products
will
continue
strong
during
the
next
year
or
two
because
domestic
purchases
will
be
supplemented
by
a
high
level
of
exports
and
foreign
relief
shipments
it
is
currently
estimated
that
from
to
percent
of
the
total
united
states
food
supply
may
be
exported
in
the
calendar
year
farm
prices
are
expected
to
remain
at
least
at
their
present
levels
in
the
immediate
future
and
for
at
least
the
next
months
they
are
expected
to
yield
a
net
farm
income
double
the
average
and
higher
than
in
any
year
prior
to
we
can
look
to
the
future
of
agriculture
with
greater
confidence
than
in
many
a
year
in
the
past
agriculture
itself
is
moving
confidently
ahead
planning
for
another
year
of
big
production
taking
definite
and
positive
steps
to
lead
the
way
toward
an
economy
of
abundance
agricultural
production
goals
for
call
for
somewhat
greater
acreage
than
actually
was
planted
in
agriculture
is
prepared
to
demonstrate
that
it
can
make
a
peacetime
contribution
as
great
as
its
contribution
toward
the
winning
of
the
war
in
spite
of
supplying
our
armed
forces
and
our
allies
during
the
war
with
a
fifth
to
a
fourth
of
our
total
food
output
farmers
were
still
able
to
provide
our
civilians
with
percent
more
food
per
capita
than
the
average
for
the
five
years
preceding
the
war
since
the
surrender
of
japan
civilian
food
consumption
has
risen
still
further
by
the
end
of
the
amount
of
the
increase
in
food
consumption
was
estimated
to
be
as
high
as
percent
over
the
prewar
average
the
record
shows
that
the
people
of
this
country
want
and
need
more
food
and
that
they
will
buy
more
food
if
only
they
have
the
jobs
and
the
purchasing
power
the
first
essential
therefore
in
providing
fully
for
the
welfare
of
agriculture
is
to
maintain
full
employment
and
a
high
level
of
purchasing
power
throughout
the
nation
for
the
period
immediately
ahead
we
shall
still
have
the
problem
of
supplying
enough
food
if
we
are
to
do
our
part
in
aiding
the
warstricken
and
starving
countries
some
of
the
food
desires
of
our
own
people
will
not
be
completely
satisfied
at
least
until
these
nations
have
had
an
opportunity
to
harvest
another
crop
during
the
next
few
months
the
need
for
food
in
the
world
will
be
more
serious
than
at
any
time
during
the
war
and
despite
the
large
shipments
we
have
already
made
and
despite
what
we
shall
send
there
remain
great
needs
abroad
beyond
the
relief
feeding
period
there
will
still
be
substantial
foreign
outlets
for
our
farm
commodities
the
chief
dependence
of
the
farmer
however
as
always
must
be
upon
the
buying
power
of
our
own
people
the
first
obligation
of
the
government
to
agriculture
for
the
reconversion
period
is
to
make
good
on
its
pricesupport
commitments
this
we
intend
to
do
with
realistic
consideration
for
the
sound
patterns
of
production
that
will
contribute
most
to
the
longtime
welfare
of
agriculture
and
the
whole
nation
the
period
during
which
prices
are
supported
will
provide
an
opportunity
for
farmers
individually
to
strengthen
their
position
in
changing
over
from
a
wartime
to
a
peacetime
basis
of
production
it
will
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
congress
to
review
the
needs
of
agriculture
and
make
changes
in
national
legislation
where
experience
has
shown
changes
to
be
needed
in
this
connection
the
congress
will
wish
to
consider
legislation
to
take
the
place
of
the
sugar
act
which
expires
at
the
end
of
this
year
during
this
period
we
must
do
a
thorough
job
of
basic
planning
to
the
end
that
agriculture
shall
be
able
to
contribute
its
full
share
toward
a
healthy
national
economy
our
longrange
agricultural
policies
should
have
two
main
objectives
first
to
assure
the
people
on
the
farms
a
fair
share
of
the
national
income
and
second
to
encourage
an
agricultural
production
pattern
that
is
best
fitted
to
the
nations
needs
to
accomplish
this
second
objective
we
shall
have
to
take
into
consideration
changes
that
have
taken
place
and
will
continue
to
take
place
in
the
production
of
farm
commoditieschanges
that
affect
costs
and
efficiency
and
volume
what
we
seek
ultimately
is
a
high
level
of
food
production
and
consumption
that
will
provide
good
nutrition
for
everyone
this
cannot
be
accomplished
by
agriculture
alone
we
can
be
certain
of
our
capacity
to
produce
food
but
we
have
often
failed
to
distribute
it
as
well
as
we
should
and
to
see
that
our
people
can
afford
to
buy
it
the
way
to
get
good
nutrition
for
the
whole
nation
is
to
provide
employment
opportunities
and
purchasing
power
for
all
groups
that
will
enable
them
to
buy
full
diets
at
market
prices
wherever
purchasing
power
fails
to
reach
this
level
we
should
see
that
they
have
some
means
of
getting
adequate
food
at
prices
in
line
with
their
ability
to
buy
therefore
we
should
have
available
supplementary
programs
that
will
enable
all
our
people
to
have
enough
of
the
right
kind
of
food
for
example
one
of
the
best
possible
contributions
toward
building
a
stronger
healthier
nation
would
be
a
permanent
schoollunch
program
on
a
scale
adequate
to
assure
every
school
child
a
good
lunch
at
noon
the
congress
of
course
has
recognized
this
need
for
a
continuing
schoollunch
program
and
legislation
to
that
effect
has
been
introduced
and
hearings
held
the
plan
contemplates
the
attainment
of
this
objective
with
a
minimum
of
federal
expenditures
i
hope
that
the
legislation
will
be
enacted
in
time
for
a
permanent
program
to
start
with
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
next
fall
we
have
the
technical
knowledge
and
the
productive
capacity
to
provide
plenty
of
good
food
for
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
united
states
it
is
time
we
made
that
possibility
a
reality
g
resource
development
the
strength
of
our
nation
and
the
welfare
of
the
people
rest
upon
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
we
have
learned
that
proper
conservation
of
our
lands
including
our
forests
and
minerals
and
wise
management
of
our
waters
will
add
immensely
to
our
national
wealth
the
first
step
in
the
governments
conservation
program
must
be
to
find
out
just
what
are
our
basic
resources
and
how
they
should
be
used
we
need
to
take
as
soon
as
possible
an
inventory
of
the
lands
the
minerals
and
the
forests
of
the
nation
during
the
war
it
was
necessary
to
curtail
some
of
our
longrange
plans
for
development
of
our
natural
reso
urces
and
to
emphasize
programs
vital
to
the
prosecution
of
the
war
work
was
suspended
on
a
number
of
flood
control
and
reclamation
projects
and
on
the
development
of
our
national
forests
and
parks
this
work
must
now
be
resumed
and
new
projects
must
be
undertaken
to
provide
essential
services
and
to
assist
in
the
process
of
economic
development
the
rivers
of
america
offer
a
great
opportunity
to
our
generation
in
the
management
of
the
national
wealth
by
a
wise
use
of
federal
funds
most
of
which
will
be
repaid
into
the
treasury
the
scourge
of
floods
and
drought
can
be
curbed
water
can
be
brought
to
arid
lands
navigation
can
be
extended
and
cheap
power
can
be
brought
alike
to
the
farms
and
to
the
industries
of
our
land
through
the
use
of
the
waters
of
the
columbia
river
for
example
we
are
creating
a
rich
agricultural
area
as
large
as
the
state
of
delaware
at
the
same
time
we
are
producing
power
at
grand
coulee
and
at
bonneville
which
played
a
mighty
part
in
winning
the
war
and
which
will
found
a
great
peacetime
industry
in
the
northwest
the
tennessee
valley
authority
will
resume
its
peacetime
program
of
promoting
full
use
of
the
resources
of
the
valley
we
shall
continue
our
plans
for
the
development
of
the
missouri
valley
the
arkansas
valley
and
the
central
valley
of
california
the
congress
has
shown
itself
alive
to
the
practical
requirements
for
a
beneficial
use
of
our
water
resources
by
providing
that
preference
in
the
sale
of
power
be
given
to
farmers
cooperatives
and
public
agencies
the
public
power
program
thus
authorized
must
continue
to
be
made
effective
by
building
the
necessary
generating
and
transmission
facilities
to
furnish
the
maximum
of
firm
power
needed
at
the
wholesale
markets
which
are
often
distant
from
the
dam
sites
these
great
developmental
projects
will
open
the
frontiers
of
agriculture
industry
and
commerce
the
employment
opportunities
thus
offered
will
also
go
far
to
ease
the
transition
from
war
to
peace
h
public
works
during
the
war
even
urgently
needed
federal
state
and
local
construction
projects
were
deferred
in
order
to
release
sources
for
war
production
in
resuming
public
works
construction
it
is
desirable
to
proceed
only
at
a
moderate
rate
since
demand
for
private
construction
will
be
abnormally
high
for
some
time
our
public
works
program
should
be
timed
to
reach
its
peak
after
demand
for
private
construction
has
begun
to
taper
off
meanwhile
however
plans
should
be
prepared
if
we
are
to
act
promptly
when
the
present
extraordinary
private
demand
begins
to
run
out
the
congress
made
money
available
to
federal
agencies
for
their
public
works
planning
in
the
fiscal
year
i
strongly
recommend
that
this
policy
be
continued
and
extended
in
the
fiscal
year
state
and
local
governments
also
have
an
essential
role
to
play
in
a
national
public
works
program
in
my
message
of
september
i
recommended
that
the
congress
vote
such
grants
to
state
and
local
governments
as
will
insure
that
each
level
of
government
makes
its
proper
contribution
to
a
balanced
public
construction
program
specifically
the
federal
government
should
aid
state
and
local
governments
in
planning
their
own
public
works
programs
in
undertaking
projects
related
to
federal
programs
of
regional
development
and
in
constructing
such
public
works
as
are
necessary
to
carry
out
the
various
policies
of
the
federal
government
early
in
the
congress
made
available
advances
to
state
and
local
governments
for
planning
public
works
projects
and
recently
made
additional
provision
to
continue
these
advances
through
the
fiscal
year
i
believe
that
further
appropriations
will
be
needed
for
the
same
purpose
for
the
fiscal
year
the
congress
has
already
made
provision
for
highway
programs
it
is
now
considering
legislation
which
would
expand
federal
grants
and
loans
in
several
other
fields
including
construction
of
airports
hospital
and
health
centers
housing
water
pollution
control
facilities
and
educational
plant
facilities
i
hope
that
early
action
will
be
taken
to
authorize
these
federal
programs
with
respect
to
public
works
of
strictly
local
importance
state
and
local
governments
should
proceed
without
federal
assistance
except
in
planning
this
rule
should
be
subject
to
review
when
and
if
the
prospect
of
highly
adverse
general
economic
developments
warrants
it
all
loans
and
grants
for
public
works
should
be
planned
and
administered
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
brought
into
accord
with
the
other
elements
of
the
federal
program
our
longrun
objective
is
to
achieve
a
program
of
direct
federal
and
federally
assisted
public
works
which
is
planned
in
advance
and
synchronized
with
business
conditions
in
this
way
it
can
make
its
greatest
contribution
to
general
economic
stability
national
housing
program
last
september
i
stated
in
my
message
to
the
congress
that
housing
was
high
on
the
list
of
matters
calling
for
decisive
action
since
then
the
housing
shortage
in
countless
communities
affecting
millions
of
families
has
magnified
this
call
to
action
today
we
face
both
an
immediate
emergency
and
a
major
postwar
problem
since
vjday
the
wartime
housing
shortage
has
been
growing
steadily
worse
and
pressure
on
real
estate
values
has
increased
returning
veterans
often
cannot
find
a
satisfactory
place
for
their
families
to
live
and
many
who
buy
have
to
pay
exorbitant
prices
rapid
demobilization
inevitably
means
further
overcrowding
a
realistic
and
practical
attack
on
the
emergency
will
require
aggressive
action
by
local
governments
with
federal
aid
to
exploit
all
opportunities
and
to
give
the
veterans
as
far
as
possible
first
chance
at
vacancies
it
will
require
continuation
of
rent
control
in
shortage
areas
as
well
as
legislation
to
permit
control
of
sales
prices
it
will
require
maximum
conversion
of
temporary
war
units
for
veterans
housing
and
their
transportation
to
communities
with
the
most
pressing
needs
the
congress
has
already
appropriated
funds
for
this
purpose
the
inflation
in
the
price
of
housing
is
growing
daily
as
a
result
of
the
housing
shortage
it
is
inevitable
that
the
present
dangers
of
inflation
in
home
values
will
continue
unless
the
congress
takes
action
in
the
immediate
future
legislation
is
now
pending
in
the
congress
which
would
provide
for
ceiling
prices
for
old
and
new
houses
the
authority
to
fix
such
ceilings
is
essential
with
such
authority
our
veterans
and
other
prospective
home
owners
would
be
protected
against
a
skyrocketing
of
home
prices
the
country
would
be
protected
from
the
extension
of
the
present
inflation
in
home
values
which
if
allowed
to
continue
will
threaten
not
only
the
stabilization
program
but
our
opportunities
for
attaining
a
sustained
high
level
of
home
construction
such
measures
are
necessary
stopgapsbut
only
stopgaps
this
emergency
action
taken
alone
is
goodbut
not
enough
the
housing
shortage
did
not
start
with
the
war
or
with
demobilization
it
began
years
before
that
and
has
steadily
accumulated
the
speed
with
which
the
congress
establishes
the
foundation
for
a
permanent
longrange
housing
program
will
determine
how
effectively
we
grasp
the
immense
opportunity
to
achieve
our
goal
of
decent
housing
and
to
make
housing
a
major
instrument
of
continuing
prosperity
and
full
employment
in
the
years
ahead
it
will
determine
whether
we
move
forward
to
a
stable
and
healthy
housing
enterprise
and
toward
providing
a
decent
home
for
every
american
family
production
is
the
only
fully
effective
answer
to
get
the
wheels
turning
i
have
appointed
an
emergency
housing
expediter
i
have
approved
establishment
of
priorities
designed
to
assure
an
ample
share
of
scarce
materials
to
builders
of
houses
for
which
veterans
will
have
preference
additional
price
and
wage
adjustments
will
be
made
where
necessary
and
other
steps
will
be
taken
to
stimulate
greater
production
of
bottleneck
items
i
recommend
consideration
of
every
sound
method
for
expansion
in
facilities
for
insurance
of
privately
financed
housing
by
the
federal
housing
administration
and
resumption
of
previously
authorized
lowrent
public
housing
projects
suspended
during
the
war
in
order
to
meet
as
many
demands
of
the
emergency
situation
as
possible
a
program
of
emergency
measures
is
now
being
formulated
for
action
these
will
include
steps
in
addition
to
those
already
taken
as
quickly
as
this
program
can
be
formulated
announcement
will
be
made
last
september
i
also
outlined
to
the
congress
the
basic
principles
for
the
kind
of
decisive
permanent
legislation
necessary
for
a
longrange
housing
program
these
principles
place
paramount
the
fact
that
housing
construction
and
financing
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
citizens
should
be
done
by
private
enterprise
they
contemplate
also
that
we
afford
governmental
encouragement
to
privately
financed
house
construction
for
families
of
moderate
income
through
extension
of
the
successful
system
of
insurance
of
housing
investment
that
research
be
undertaken
to
develop
better
and
cheaper
methods
of
building
homes
that
communities
be
assisted
in
appraising
their
housing
needs
that
we
commence
a
program
of
federal
aid
with
fair
local
participation
to
stimulate
and
promote
the
rebuilding
and
redevelopment
of
slums
and
blighted
areaswith
maximum
use
of
private
capital
it
is
equally
essential
that
we
use
public
funds
to
assist
families
of
low
income
who
could
not
otherwise
enjoy
adequate
housing
and
that
we
quicken
our
rate
of
progress
in
rural
housing
legislation
now
under
consideration
by
the
congress
provides
for
a
comprehensive
attack
jointly
by
private
enterprise
state
and
local
authorities
and
the
federal
government
this
legislation
would
make
permanent
the
national
housing
agency
and
give
it
authority
and
funds
for
much
needed
technical
and
economic
research
it
would
provide
additional
stimulus
for
privately
financed
housing
construction
this
stimulus
consists
of
establishing
a
new
system
of
yield
insurance
to
encourage
largescale
investment
in
rental
housing
and
broadening
the
insuring
powers
of
the
federal
housing
administration
and
the
lending

powers
of
the
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
where
private
industry
cannot
build
the
government
must
step
in
to
do
the
job
the
bill
would
encourage
expansion
in
housing
available
for
the
lowest
income
groups
by
continuing
to
provide
direct
subsidies
for
lowrent
housing
and
rural
housing
it
would
facilitate
land
assembly
for
urban
redevelopment
by
loans
and
contributions
to
local
public
agencies
where
the
localities
do
their
share
prompt
enactment
of
permanent
housing
legislation
along
these
lines
will
not
interfere
with
the
emergency
action
already
under
way
on
the
contrary
it
would
lift
us
out
of
a
potentially
perpetual
state
of
housing
emergency
it
would
offer
the
best
hope
and
prospect
to
millions
of
veterans
and
other
american
families
that
the
american
system
can
offer
more
to
them
than
temporary
makeshifts
i
have
said
before
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
can
be
the
best
housed
people
in
the
world
i
repeat
that
assertion
and
i
welcome
the
cooperation
of
the
congress
in
achieving
that
goal
j
social
security
and
health
our
social
security
system
has
just
celebrated
its
tenth
anniversary
during
the
past
decade
this
program
has
supported
the
welfare
and
morale
of
a
large
part
of
our
people
by
removing
some
of
the
hazards
and
hardships
of
the
aged
the
unemployed
and
widows
and
dependent
children
but
looking
back
over
years
experience
and
ahead
to
the
future
we
cannot
fail
to
see
defects
and
serious
inadequacies
in
our
system
as
it
now
exists
benefits
are
in
many
cases
inadequate
a
great
many
persons
are
excluded
from
coverage
and
provision
has
not
been
made
for
social
insurance
to
cover
the
cost
of
medical
care
and
the
earnings
lost
by
the
sick
and
the
disabled
in
the
field
of
oldage
security
there
seems
to
be
no
adequate
reason
for
excluding
such
groups
as
the
selfemployed
agricultural
and
domestic
workers
and
employees
of
nonprofit
organizations
since
many
of
these
groups
earn
wages
too
low
to
permit
significant
savings
for
old
age
they
are
in
special
need
of
the
assured
income
that
can
be
provided
by
oldage
insurance
we
must
take
urgent
measures
for
the
readjustment
period
ahead
the
congress
for
some
time
has
been
considering
legislation
designed
to
supplement
at
federal
expense
during
the
immediate
reconversion
period
compensation
payments
to
the
unemployed
again
i
urge
the
congress
to
enact
legislation
liberalizing
unemployment
compensation
benefits
and
extending
the
coverage
providing
for
the
sustained
consumption
by
the
unemployed
persons
and
their
families
is
more
than
a
welfare
policy
it
is
sound
economic
policy
a
sustained
high
level
of
consumer
purchases
is
a
basic
ingredient
of
a
prosperous
economy
during
the
war
nearly
million
men
were
rejected
for
military
service
because
of
physical
or
mental
defects
which
in
many
cases
might
have
been
prevented
or
corrected
this
is
shocking
evidence
that
large
sections
of
the
population
are
at
substandard
levels
of
health
the
need
for
a
program
that
will
give
everyone
opportunity
for
medical
care
is
obvious
nor
can
there
be
any
serious
doubt
of
the
governments
responsibility
for
helping
in
this
human
and
social
problem
the
comprehensive
health
program
which
i
recommended
on
november
will
require
substantial
additions
to
the
social
security
system
and
in
conjunction
with
other
changes
that
need
to
be
made
will
require
further
consideration
of
the
financial
basis
for
social
security
the
system
of
prepaid
medical
care
which
i
have
recommended
is
expected
eventually
to
require
amounts
equivalent
to
percent
of
earnings
up
to
a
year
which
is
about
the
average
of
present
expenditures
by
individuals
for
medical
care
the
pooling
of
medical
costs
under
a
plan
which
permits
each
individual
to
make
a
free
choice
of
doctor
and
hospital
would
assure
that
individuals
receive
adequate
treatment
and
hospitalization
when
they
are
faced
with
emergencies
for
which
they
cannot
budget
individually
in
addition
i
recommended
insurance
benefits
to
replace
part
of
the
earnings
lost
through
temporary
sickness
and
permanent
disability
even
without
these
proposed
major
additions
it
would
now
be
time
to
undertake
a
thorough
reconsideration
of
our
social
security
laws
the
structure
should
be
expanded
and
liberalized
provision
should
be
made
for
extending
coverage
credit
to
veterans
for
the
period
of
their
service
in
the
armed
forces
in
the
financial
provisions
we
must
reconcile
the
actuarial
needs
of
social
security
including
health
insurance
with
the
requirements
of
a
revenue
system
that
is
designed
to
promote
a
high
level
of
consumption
and
full
employment
k
education
although
the
major
responsibility
for
financing
education
rests
with
the
states
some
assistance
has
long
been
given
by
the
federal
government
further
assistance
is
desirable
and
essential
there
are
many
areas
and
some
whole
states
where
good
schools
cannot
be
provided
without
imposing
an
undue
local
tax
burden
on
the
citizens
it
is
essential
to
provide
adequate
elementary
and
secondary
schools
everywhere
and
additional
educational
opportunities
for
large
numbers
of
people
beyond
the
secondary
level
accordingly
i
repeat
the
proposal
of
last
years
budget
message
that
the
federal
government
provide
financial
aid
to
assist
the
states
in
assuring
more
nearly
equal
opportunities
for
a
good
education
the
proposed
federal
grants
for
current
educational
expenditures
should
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
improving
the
educational
system
where
improvement
is
most
needed
they
should
not
be
used
to
replace
existing
nonfederal
expenditures
or
even
to
restore
merely
the
situation
which
existed
before
the
war
in
the
future
we
expect
incomes
considerably
higher
than
before
the
war
higher
incomes
should
make
it
possible
for
state
and
local
governments
and
for
individuals
to
support
higher
and
more
nearly
adequate
expenditures
for
education
but
inequality
among
the
states
will
still
remain
and
federal
help
will
still
be
needed
as
a
part
of
our
total
public
works
program
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
need
for
providing
adequate
buildings
for
schools
and
other
educational
institutions
in
view
of
current
arrears
in
the
construction
of
educational
facilities
i
believe
that
legislation
to
authorize
grants
for
educational
facilities
to
be
matched
by
similar
expenditures
by
state
and
local
authorities
should
receive
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
the
federal
government
has
not
sought
and
will
not
seek
to
dominate
education
in
the
states
it
should
continue
its
historic
role
of
leadership
and
advice

for
the
purpose
of
equalizing

opportunity
it
should

support
to
the
cause
of

in
areas
where
this
is
desirable
l
federal
government
personnel
the
rapid
reconversion
of
the
federal
government
from
war
to
peace
is
reflected
in
the
demobilization
of
its
civilian
personnel
the
number
of
these
employees
in
continental
united
states
has
been
reduced
by
more
than
from
the
total
of
approximately
employed
in
the
final
months
of
the
war
i
expect
that
by
next
june
we
shall
have
made
a
further
reduction
of
equal
magnitude
and
that
there
will
be
continuing
reductions
during
the
next
fiscal
year
of
the
special
wartime
agencies
now
remaining
only
a
few
are
expected
to
continue
actively
into
the
next
fiscal
year
at
the
same
time
that
we
have
curtailed
the
number
of
employees
we
have
shortened
the
workweek
by
onesixth
or
more
throughout
the
government
and
have
restored
holidays
the
process
of
readjustment
has
been
complicated
and
costs
have
been
increased
by
a
heavy
turnover
in
the
remaining
personnelparticularly
by
the
loss
of
some
of
our
best
administrators
thousands
of
war
veterans
have
been
reinstated
or
newly
employed
in
the
civil
service
many
civilians
have
been
transferred
from
war
agencies
to
their
former
peacetime
agencies
recruitment
standards
which
had
to
be
relaxed
during
the
war
are
now
being
tightened
the
elimination
last
autumn
of
overtime
work
for
nearly
all
federal
employees
meant
a
sharp
cut
in
their
incomes
for
salaried
workers
the
blow
was
softened
but
by
no
means
offset
by
the
increased
rates
of
pay
which
had
become
effective
july
further
adjustments
to
compensate
for
increased
living
costs
are
required
moreover
we
have
long
needed
a
general
upward
revision
of
federal
government
salary
scales
at
all
levels
in
all
brancheslegislative
judicial
and
executive
too
many
in
government
have
had
to
sacrifice
too
much
in
economic
advantage
to
serve
the
nation
adequate
salaries
will
result
in
economies
and
improved
efficiency
in
the
conduct
of
government
businessgains
that
will
far
outweigh
the
immediate
costs
i
hope
the
congress
will
expedite
action
on
salary
legislation
for
all
federal
employees
in
all
branches
of
the
government
the
only
exception
i
would
make
is
in
the
case
of
workers
whose
pay
rates
are
established
by
wage
boards
a
blanket
adjustment
would
destroy
the
system
by
which
their
wages
are
kept
aligned
with
prevailing
rates
in
particular
localities
the
wage
boards
should
be
sensitive
now
as
they
were
during
the
war
to
changes
in
local
prevailing
wage
rates
and
should
make
adjustments
accordingly
i
hope
also
that
the
congress
may
see
fit
to
enact
legislation
for
the
adequate
protection
of
the
health
and
safety
of
federal
employees
for
their
coverage
under
a
system
of
unemployment
compensation
and
for
their
return
at
government
expense
to
their
homes
after
separation
from
wartime
service
m
territories
insular
possessions
and
the
district
of
columbia
the
major
governments
of
the
world
face
few
problems
as
important
and
as
perplexing
as
those
relating
to
dependent
peoples
this
government
is
committed
to
the
democratic
principle
that
it
is
for
the
dependent
peoples
themselves
to
decide
what
their
status
shall
be
to
this
end
i
asked
the
congress
last
october
to
provide
a
means
by
which
the
people
of
puerto
rico
might
choose
their
form
of
government
and
ultimate
status
with
respect
to
the
united
states
i
urge
too
that
the
congress
promptly
accede
to
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
h
awaii
that
the
territory
be
admitted
to
statehood
in
our
union
and
that
similar
action
be
taken
with
respect
to
alaska
as
soon
as
it
is
certain
that
this
is
the
desire
of
the
people
of
that
great
territory
the
people
of
the
virgin
islands
should
be
given
an
increasing
measure
of
selfgovernment
we
have
already
determined
that
the
philippine
islands
are
to
be
independent
on
july
the
ravages
of
war
and
enemy
occupation
however
have
placed
a
heavy
responsibility
upon
the
united
states
i
urge
that
the
congress
complete
as
promptly
and
as
generously
as
may
be
possible
legislation
which
will
aid
economic
rehabilitation
for
the
philippines
this
will
be
not
only
a
just
acknowledgment
of
the
loyalty
of
the
people
of
the
philippines
but
it
will
help
to
avoid
the
economic
chaos
which
otherwise
will
be
their
heritage
from
our
common
war
perhaps
no
event
in
the
long
centuries
of
colonialism
gives
more
hope
for
the
pattern
of
the
future
than
the
independence
of
the
philippines
the
district
of
columbia
because
of
its
special
relation
to
the
federal
government
has
been
treated
since
as
a
dependent
area
we
should
move
toward
a
greater
measure
of
local
selfgovernment
consistent
with
the
constitutional
status
of
the
district
we
should
take
adequate
steps
to
assure
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
are
not
denied
their
franchise
merely
because
they
reside
at

capital
iii
the
budget
for
the
federal
program
for
the
fiscal
year
summary
of
the
budget
for
the
first
time
since
the
fiscal
year
the
budget
for
the
next
fiscal
year
will
require
no
increase
in
the
national
debt
expenditures
of
all
kinds
authorized
and
recommended
in
the
next
year
are
estimated
at
just
above
billion
dollars
net
receipts
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
the
estimated
difference
of
billion
dollars
will
be
met
by
a
reduction
in
the
very
substantial
balance
which
will
be
in
the
treasury
during
the
next
fiscal
year
a
large
part
of
the
activities
outside
defense
and
war
liquidation
aftermath
of
war
and
international
finance
classified
as
other
activities
in
a
following
table
is
still
due
to
repercussions
of
the
war
these
other
activities
include
more
than
billion
dollars
for
aids
to
agriculture
and
net
outlays
for
the
commodity
credit
corporationalmost
double
the
expenditures
for
the
same
purposes
in
prewar
years
this
increase
is
due
mainly
to
expenditures
for
purposes
of
price
stabilization
and
price
support
resulting
from
the
war
food
production
program
other
increases
in
this
category
are
due
to
the
fact
that
certain
wartime
agencies
now
in
the
process
of
liquidation
are
included
in
this
group
of
activities
if
all
expenditures
for
those
activities
which
are
directly
or
indirectly
related
to
the
war
are
excluded
the
residual
expenditures
are
below
those
for
corresponding
activities
in
prewar
years
in
making
this
comparison
account
should
be
taken
of
the
fact
that
while
prewar
expenditures
were
affected
by
direct
relief
and
work
relief
for
the
unemployed
the
postwar
budgets
are
affected
by
the
considerable
increase
in
pay
rates
and
other
increases
in
costs
and
prices
to
elaborate
the
budget
as
i
have
remarked
above
reflects
on
both
sides
of
the
ledger
the
governments
program
as
recommended
by
the
executive
it
includes
estimates
not
only
of
expenditures
and
receipts
for
which
legislative
authority
already
exists
but
also
of
expenditures
and
receipts
for
which
authorization
is
recommended
the
budget
total
for
the
next
fiscal
year
the
year
that
ends
on
june
is
estimated
at
just
above
billion
dollarsabout
a
third
of
the
budgets
for
global
war
although
nearly
four
times
the
prewar
budgets
this
estimate
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
a
rapid
liquidation
of
the
war
program
will
be
associated
with
rapid
reconversion
and
expansion
of
peacetime
production
the
total
includes
net
outlays
of
government
corporations
the
estimated
expenditures
in
the
next
and
current
fiscal
year
compare
as
follows
with
those
of
a
year
of
global
war
and
a
prewar
year
total
budget
expenditures
fiscal
year
in
millions
although
allowances
for
occupation
demobilization
and
defense
are
drastically
reduced
in
the
fiscal
year
they
will
still
amount
to
percent
of
the
total
budget
the
socalled
aftermath
of
war
expenditures
account
for
a
further
percent
of
the
total
the
total
of
all
other
programs
which
was
drastically
cut
during
the
war
is
increasing
again
as
liquidation
of
the
war
program
proceeds
and
renewed
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
peacetime
objectives
of
the
government
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
net
receipts
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
this
estimate
assumes
that
all
existing
taxes
will
continue
all
through
the
fiscal
year
included
are
the
extraordinary
receipts
from
the
disposal
of
surplus
property
as
a
result
estimated
expenditures
will
exceed
estimated
receipts
by
billion
dollars
this
amount
can
be
provided
by
a
reduction
in
the
cash
balance
in
the
treasury
thus
after
a
long
period
of
increasing
public
debt
resulting
from
depression
budgets
and
war
budgets
it
is
anticipated
that
no
increase
in
the
federal

will
be
required

fighting
a
major

and
federal

were
running
at
an
annual
rate
of
about
billion

by

that
rate
will
be
more
than
cut
in

the

is
now
estimated
at
billion
dollars
of
which
more
than
twothirds
provides
for

since
net

are
estimated
at

there
will
be
an
excess
of

of

for

it
should
be

that
many
of
the

are
initial

these

new

such
as
that

agency
will
require
larger
amounts
in

the

exclude
major
elements
of
the
proposed
national

program
since
the
greater
part
of
these
will
be

the

federal

i
financial

and

policy
recommendations
for

legislation
should
be
considered
not
only
in
the
light
of
the
financial
requirements
of
the
ensuing
year
but
also
in
the
light
of
future
years
financial
requirements
and
a
full
consideration
of
economic
conditions
expenditures
are
estimated
at
nearly
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
they
can
hardly
be
expected
to
be
reduced
to
less
than
billion
dollars
in
subsequent
years
net
receipts
in
the
fiscal
year
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
included
in
this
estimate
are
billion
dollars
of
receipts
from
disposal
and
rental
of
surplus
property
and
million
dollars
of
receipts
from
renegotiation
of
wartime
contracts
these
sources
of
receipts
will
disappear
in
future
years
tax
collections
for
the
fiscal
year
also
will
not
yet
fully
reflect
the
reduction
in
corporate
tax
liabilities
provided
in
the
revenue
act
of
if
the
extraordinary
receipts
from
the
disposal
of
surplus
property
and
renegotiation
of
contracts
be
disregarded
and
if
the
tax
reductions
adopted
in
the
revenue
act
of
were
fully
effective
present
tax
rates
would
yield
about
billion
dollars
these
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
are
based
on
the
assumption
of
generally
favorable
business
conditions
but
not
on
an
income
reflecting
full
employment
and
the
high
productivity
that
we
hope
to
achieve
in
future
years
the
present
tax
system
in
conjunction
with
a
full
employment
level
of
national
income
could
be
expected
to
yield
more
than
billion
dollars
which
is
substantially
above
the
anticipated
peacetime
level
of
expenditures
in
view
of
the
still
extraordinarily
large
expenditures
in
the
coming
year
and
continuing
inflationary
pressures
i
am
making
no
recommendation
for
tax
reduction
at
this
time
we
have
already
had
a
substantial
reduction
in
taxes
from
wartime
peaks
the
revenue
act
of
was
a
major
taxreduction
measure
it
decreased
the
total
tax
load
by
more
than
onesixth
an
amount
substantially
in
excess
of
the
reductions
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
congressional
tax
committees
in
october
these
proposed
reductions
were
designed
to
encourage
reconversion
and
peacetime
business
expansion
the
possibility
of
further
tax
reductions
must
depend
on
the
budgetary
situation
and
the
economic
situation
the
level
of
anticipated
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
and
the
volume
of
outstanding
public
debt
require
the
maintenance
of
large
revenues
moreover
inflationary
pressures
still
appear
dangerously
powerful
and
illadvised
tax
reduction
would
operate
to
strengthen
them
still
further
my
decision
not
to
recommend
additional
tax
reductions
at
this
time
is
made
in
the
light
of
existing
economic
conditions
and
prospects
borrowing
and
the
public
debt
the
successful
conclusion
of
the
victory
loan
marked
the
end
of
war
borrowing
and
the
beginning
of
the
transition
to
postwar
debt
management
because
of
the
success
of
the
victory
loan
i
am
happy
to
report
that
the
treasury
will
not
need
to
borrow
any
new
money
from
the
public
during
the
remainder
of
the
present
fiscal
year
except
through
regular
sales
of
savings
bonds
and
savings
notes
furthermore
a
part
of
the
large
cash
balance
now
in
the
treasury
will
be
used
for
debt
redemption
so
that
the
public
debt
which
now
amounts
to
about
billion
dollars
will
decrease
by
several
billion
dollars
during
the
next
months
the
present
statutory
debt
limit
of
billion
dollars
will
provide
an
ample
margin
for
all
of
the
publicdebt
transactions
through
the
fiscal
year
the
net
effect
of
the
excess
of
expenditures
and
debt
redemption
on
the
treasury
cash
balance
as
compared
with
selected
previous
years
is
shown

these

through

the

owners
will
change
even
though
the

followed
in

will
have
a
major
impact
not

on
the
provision
for

payments
in

budgets
but
also
on
the
level
of
interest
rates
prevailing
in
private
financing
the
average
rate
of
interest
on
the
debt
is
now
a
little
under
percent
low
interest
rates
will
be
an
important
force
in
promoting
the
full
production
and
full
employment
in
the
postwar
period
for
which
we
are
all
striving
close
wartime
cooperation
between
the
treasury
department
and
the
federal
reserve
system
has
made
it
possible
to
finance
the
most
expensive
war
in
history
at
low
and
stable
rates
of
interest
this
cooperation
will
continue
no
less
important
than
the
level
of
interest
rates
paid
on
the

is
the
distribution
of
its
ownership
of
the

more

heavy

were
necessary
to
provide

to

a
considerable
portion
of
these

are

in
character
and
hence
will
require

years
since
they
have
been
purchased
out
of
newly
created
bank

continuance
of
the

low

of

is
entirely
appropriate
to
do
otherwise
would
merely
increase
bank
profits
at
the
expense
of
the
taxpayer
the
billion
dollar
debt
poses
a
problem
that
requires
careful
consideration
in
the
determination
of
financial
and
economic
policies
we
have
learned
that
the
problem
serious
as
it
is
can
be
managed
its
management
will
require
determined
action
to
keep
our
federal
budget
in
order
and
to
relate
our
fiscal
policies
to
the
requirements
of
an
expanding
economy
the
more
successful
we
are
in
achieving
full
production
and
full
employment
the
easier
it
will
be
to
manage
the
debt
and
pay
for
the
debt
service
large
though
the
debt
is
it
is
within
our
economic
capacity
the
interest
charges
on
it
amount
to
but
a
small
proportion
of
our
national
income
the
government
is
determined
by
a
resolute
policy
of
economic
stabilization
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
millions
of
american
citizens
who
have
invested
in
its
securities
during
the
past
months
the
net
revenue
receipts
of
the
federal
government
have
been
about
billion
dollars
almost
as
much
as
during
the
closing
months
of
when
the
country
was
still
engaged
in
allout
warfare
the
high
level
of
these
receipts
reflects
the
smoothness
of
the
reconversion
and
particularly
the
strength
of
consumer
demand
but
the
receipts
so
far
collected
it
must
be
remembered
do
not
reflect
any
of
the
tax
reductions
made
by
the
revenue
act
of
these
reductions
will
not
have
their
full
effect
on
the
revenue
collected
until
the
fiscal
year
it
is
good
to
move
toward
a
balanced
budget
and
a
start
on
the
retirement
of
the
debt
at
a
time
when
demand
for
goods
is
strong
and
the
business
outlook
is
good
these
conditions
prevail
today
business
is
good
and
there
are
still
powerful
forces
working
in
the

that
ended
on

almost
wholly
a
period
of

war
expenditures
amounted
to

for

war

were

that
estimate
was
made
a
year
ago
while
we
were
still
engaged
in
global
warfare
after
victory
over
japan
this
estimate
was
revised
to
billion
dollars
further
cutbacks
and
accelerated
demobilization
have
made
possible
an
additional
reduction
in
the
rate
of
war
spending
during
the
first
months
billion
dollars
were
spent
it
is
now
estimated
that
billion

will
be
spent
during
the
second
months
or
a
total
of
billion
dollars
during
the
whole
fiscal
year
for
the
fiscal

it
is
estimated
tentatively
that
expenditures
for
war
liquidation
for
occupation
and
for
national
defense
will
be
reduced
to
billion
dollars
the
war
and
navy
departments
are
expected
to
spend
billion
dollars
expenditures
of
other
agencies
such
as
the

maritime
commission
the
war
shipping
administration
and
the
office
of

and

estimated
at
billion
dollars
allowing
for
estimated
net
receipts
of

arising
from
war
activities
of
the

finance
corporation
the
estimated
total
of

expenditures
is
billion
dollars
at
this
time
only
a
tentative
breakdown
of
the
total
estimate
for
war
and
defense
activities
can
be
indicated
an
expenditure
of
billion
dollars
for
war
liquidation
occupation
and
national
defense
is
a
large
sum
for
a
year
which
begins
months
after
fighting
has
ended
it
is
times
our
expenditures
for
defense
before
the
war
it
amounts
to
about
percent
of
our
expected
national
income
this
estimate
reflects
the
immense
job
that
is
involved
in
winding
up
a
global
war
effort
and
stresses
the
great
responsibility
that
victory
has
placed
upon
this
country
the
large
expenditures
needed
for
our
national
defense
emphasize
the
great
scope
for
effective
organization
in
furthering
economy
and
efficiency
to
this
end
i
have
recently
recommended
to
the
congress
adoption
of
legislation
combining
the
war
and
navy
departments
into
a
single
department
of
national
defense
a
large
part
of
these
expenditures
is
still
to
be
attributed
to
the
costs
of
the
war
assuming
somewhat
arbitrarily
that
about
onehalf
of
the
billiondollar
outlay
for
the
fiscal
year
is
for
war
liquidation
aggregate
expenditures
by
this
government
for
the
second
world
war
are
now
estimated
at
billion
dollars
through
june
of
this
about
billion
dollars
will
have
been
recovered
through
renegotiation
and
sale
of
surplus
property
by
june
this
has
been
reflected
in
the
estimates

of
our
armed

is
proceeding
rapidly
at

about
million
men
and
women
were
in
the

million
were
overseas
by
the
end

our

had

item
of
our

expense
it
will
total
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
and
about
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
in
the
fiscal
year
the
strength
of
our
armed
forces
will
still
be
above
the
ultimate
peacetime
level
as
i
have
said
war
and
navy
department
requirements
indicate
a
strength
of
about
million
in
the
armed

a
year
from
now
this
is
necessary
to
enable
us
to
do
our
share
in
the
occupation
of
enemy
territories
and
in
the
preservation
of
peace
in

winding
up
of

procurement
is
the
second
most
important
liquidation
job
by
the
end
of
november
a
total
of
prime
contracts
involving
commitments
of
billion
dollars
had
been
terminated
of
this
total
contracts
with
commitments
of
billion
dollars
remained
to
be
settled
termination
payments
on
these
contracts
are
estimated
at
about
billion
dollars
it
is
expected
that
more
than
half
of
these
terminated
contracts
will
be
settled
during
the
current
fiscal
year
leaving
payments
of
about
billion
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
another
important
aspect
of
war
supply
liquidation
is
the
disposal
of
surplus
property
munitions
ships
plants
installations
and
supplies
originally
costing
billion
dollars
or
more
will
ultimately
be
declared
surplus
the
sale
value
of
this
property
will
be
far
less
than
original
cost
and
disposal
expenses
are
estimated
at
to
cents
on
each
dollar
realized

units
within
existing

have
been
organized
to
liquidate
surplus

under
the
direction
of
the
surplus

administration
overseas
disposal
activities
have
been
centralized
in
the
state
department
to
permit
this
program
to
be
carried
on
in
line
with
overall
foreign
policy
thus
far
only
about
billion
dollars
of
the
ultimate
surplus
including
billion
dollars
of
unsalable
aircraft
has
been
declared
of
this
amount
billion
dollars
have
been
disposed
of
in
sales
yielding
million
dollars
the
tremendous
job
of
handling
surplus
stocks
will
continue
to
affect
federal
expenditures
and
receipts
for
several
years
the
speed
and
effectiveness
of
surplus
disposal
operations
will
be
of
great
importance
for
the
domestic
economy
as
well
as
for
foreign
economic
policies
war
supplies
maintenance
and

provision
for
the
national
defense
requires
that
we
keep
abreast
of
scientific
and
technical
advances
the
tentative
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
make
allowance
for
military
research
limited
procurement
of
weapons
in
the
developmental
state
and
some
regular
procurement
of
munitions
which
were
developed
but
not
massproduced
when
the
war
ended
expenditures
for
procurement
and
construction
will
constitute
onethird
or
less
of
total
defense
outlays
compared
to
a
ratio
of
twothirds
during
the
war
years
the
estimates
also
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
our
warexpanded
naval
and
merchant
fleets
military
installations
and
stocks
of
military
equipment
and

our
naval
combatant
fleet
is
three
times
its
prepearl
harbor
tonnage
our
merchant
marine
is
five
times
its
prewar
size
the

department
has
billions
of

of

considerable
maintenance
and

expense
is
necessary
for
the
equipment
which
we
desire
to
retain

expenses
will
be
incurred
for
winnowing
the
stocks
of

for

and
for

military

in
the
current
fiscal
year
include
million
dollars
for
civilian
supplies
for
the
prevention
of
starvation
and
disease
in
occupied
areas
expenditures
on
this
account
will
continue
in
the
fiscal
year
the
war
expenditures
also
cover
the
expenses
of
civilian
administration
in
occupied
areas
during
the
war
cents
of
each
dollar
of
our
war
expenditures
was
for
lendlease
aid
with
lendlease
terminated
i
expect
the
direct
operations
under
this
program
to
be
substantially
completed
in
the
current
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
estimated
for
the
fiscal
year
under
this
program
are
mainly
interagency
reimbursements
for
past
transactions
relief
and
rehabilitation
expenditures
are
increasing
it
is
imperative
that
we
give
all
necessary
aid
within
our
means
to
the
people
who
have
borne
the
ravages
of
war
i
estimate
that
in
the
fiscal
year
expenditures
for
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
will
total
billion
dollars
and
in
the
following
year
billion
dollars
insofar
as
possible
procurement
for
this
purpose
will
be
from
war
surpluses
b
authorizations
for
war
and
national

defense
during
the
war
authorizations
and
appropriations
had
to
be
enacted
well
in
advance
of
obligation
and
spending
to
afford
ample
time
for
planning
of
production
by
the
procurement
services
and
by
industry
thus
our
cumulative
war
program
authorized
in
the
period
between
july
and
july
was
billion
dollars
including
net
war
commitments
of
government
corporations
expenditures
against
those
authorizations
totaled
billion
dollars
this
left
billion
dollars
in
unobligated
authorizations
and
unliquidated
obligations
with
the
end
of
fighting
it
became
necessary
to
adjust
war
authorizations
to
the
requirements
of
war
liquidation
and
continuing
national
defense
intensive
review
of
the
war
authorizations
by
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
has
been
continued
since
vjday
as
a
result
the
authorized
war
program
is
being
brought
more
nearly
into
line
with
expenditures
recisions
and
authorizations
through
the
fiscal
year
readjusting
the
war
program
as
the
congress
well
knows
is
not
an
easy
task
authorizations
must
not
be
too
tight
lest
we
hamper
necessary
operations
they
must
not
be
too
ample
lest
we
lose
control
of
spending
last
september
i
transmitted
to
the
congress
recommendations
on
the
basis
of
which
the
congress
voted
hr
to
repeal
billion
dollars
of
appropriations
and
authorizations
i
found
it
necessary
to
veto
this
bill
because
it
was
used
as
a
vehicle
for
legislation
that
would
impair
the
reemployment
program
however
in
order
to
preserve
the
fine
work
of
the
congress
on
the
recisions
i
asked
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget
to
place
the
exact
amounts
indicated
for
repeal
in
a
nonexpendable
reserve
and
to
advise
the
departments
and
agencies
accordingly
this
has
been
done
in
accord
with
public
law
of
the
seventyninth
congress
i
have
transmitted
recommendations
for
additional
rescissions
for
the
current
fiscal
year
of
appropriations
amounting
to
billion
dollars
and
of
contract
authorizations
totaling
million
dollars
the
net
reduction
in
authority
to
obligate
will
be
billion
dollars
because
of
the
appropriations
billion
dollars
will
have
to
be
restored
in
subsequent
years
to
liquidate
contract
authorizations
still
on
the
books
the
appropriations
recommended
for
repeal
include
million
dollars
for
the
navy
department
million
dollars
for
the
war
department
million
dollars
for
lendlease
million
dollars
for
the
war
shipping
administration
and
million
dollars
for
the
united
states
maritime
commission
the
contract
authorizations
proposed
for
repeal
are
for
the
maritime
commission
in
addition
there
are
unused
tonnage
authorizations
for
construction
of
naval
vessels
now
valued
at
billion
dollars
in
september
i
suggested
that
this
authority
be
reviewed
by
the
appropriate
committees
of
the
congress
and
the
congress
has
moved
to
bar
construction
under
these
authorizations
during
the
remainder
of
the
fiscal
year
i
propose
to
continue
this
prohibition
in
the
navy
budget
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
and
now
renew
my
recommendation
that
legislation
be
enacted
at
the
earliest
time
to
dear
the
statute
books
of
these
authorizations
the
amounts
indicated
for
repeal
in
hr
and
the
further
rescissions
which
i
have
recommended
excluding
duplications
and
deferred
cash
payments
on
existing
authorizations
represent
a
cut
in
the
authorized
war
program
of
billion
dollars
the
war
authorizations
will
also
be
reduced
billion
dollars
by
carrying
receipts
of
revolving
accounts
to
surplus
by
lapses
and
by
cancellation
and
repayment
of
commitments
of
the
government
war
corporations
on
the
other
hand
supplemental
appropriations
of
million
dollars
will
be
required
for
the
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
in
the
net
it
is
estimated
that
the
cumulative
authorized
war
and
national
defense
program
will
amount
to
billion
dollars
on
june
expenditures
of
billion
dollars
during
the
fiscal
year
will
have
pushed
cumulative
expenditures
to
billion
dollars
the
unexpended
balances
will
be
down
to
billion
dollars
on
june
new
authorizations
for
national
defense
and
war
liquidation
in
the
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
of
billion
dollars
for
national
defense
and
war
liquidation
in
the
fiscal
year
will
be
partly
for
payment
of
contractual
obligations
incurred
in
the
past
and
partly
for
the
payment
of
new
obligations
the
unexpended
balances
on
june
will
be
scattered
among
hundreds
of
separate
appropriations
thus
while
some
appropriation
accounts
will
have
unused
balances
others
will
require
additional
appropriations
it
is
estimated
that
authorizations
to
incur
new
obligations
of
million
dollars
will
be
needed
during
the
fiscal
year
mainly
for
the
war
and
navy
departments
of
the
required
authorizations
million
dollars
will
be
in
new
appropriations
million
dollars
in
new
contract
authority
and
million
dollars
in
reappropriations
of
unobligated
balances
in
addition
appropriations
of
million
dollars
will
be
needed
to
liquidate
obligations
under
existing
contract
authorizations
taking
into
account
the
tentative
authorizations
and
expenditures
estimated
for
the
fiscal
year
and
offsets
of
billion
dollars
in
war
commitments
of
government
corporations
the
cumulative
authorized
war
and
national
defense
program
on
june
will
be
billion
dollars
total
expenditures
billion
dollars
and
unexpended
balances
billion
dollars
the
billion
dollars
of
unexpended
balances
tentatively
indicated
as
of
june
comprise
both
unobligated
authorizations
and
unliquidated
obligations
most
of
the
unliquidated
obligations
result
from
transactions
booked
during
the
war
years
a
large
part
of
the
billion
dollars
would
never
be
spent
even
if
not
repealed
for
the
appropriations
will
lapse
in
due
course
for
example
several
billion
dollars
of
these
unliquidated
obligations
represent
unsettled
inter
and
intradepartmental
agency
accounts
for
war
procurement
legislation
is
being
requested
to
facilitate
the
adjustment
of
some
of
these
interagency
accounts
another
billion
dollars
is
set
aside
for
contract
termination
payments
if
contract
settlement
costs
continue
in
line
with
recent
experience
it
is
likely
that
part
of
the
billion
dollars
will
remain
unspent
on
the
other
hand
some
of
the
billion
dollars
would
be
available
for
obligation
and
expenditure
unless
impounded
in
certain
appropriations
such
as
those
for
longcycle
procurement
considerable
carryover
of
unliquidated
obligations
into
future
years
is
to
be
expected
and
is
necessary
however
substantial
further
rescissions
can
and
should
be
made
when
the
war
liquidation
program
tapers
off
and
budgetary
requirements
for
national
defense
are
clarified
as
i
have
said
i
shall
continue
to
review
the
war
authorizations
and
from
time
to
time
recommend
excess
balances
for
repeal
as
in
recent
years
detailed
recommendations
concerning
most
appropriations
for
the
national
defense
program
are
postponed
until
the
spring
in
connection
with
the
war
activities
of
the
united
states
maritime
commission
and
certain
other
agencies
however
i
now
make
specific
recommendations
for
the
fiscal
year
no
additional
authorizations
or
appropriations
will
be
necessary
for
the
maritime
commission
since
sufficient
balances
will
be
left
after
the
abovementioned
rescissions
to
carry
out
the
program
now
contemplated
for
the
fiscal
year
aftermath
of
war
nearly
onethird
billion
dollarsof
estimated
federal
expenditures
in
the
fiscal
year
will
be
for
purposes
that
are
largely
inherited
from
the
warpayments
to
veterans
interest
on
the
federal
debt
and
refunds
of
taxes
a
for
veterans
veterans
pensions
and
benefits
has
become
one
of
the
largest
single
categories
in
the
federal
budget
i
am
recommending
for
this
purpose
total
appropriations
of
million
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
expenditures
in
the
fiscal
year
are
estimated
under
present
legislation
at
million
dollars
these
expenditures
will
help
our
veterans
through
their
readjustment
period
and
provide
lasting
care
for
those
who
were
disabled
the
congress
has
provided
unemployment
allowances
for
veterans
during
their
readjustment
period
expenditure
of
million
dollars
for
this
purpose
is
anticipated
for
the
fiscal
year
in
addition
readjustment
allowances
for
selfemployed
veterans
are
expected
to
cost
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
on
may
in
asking
the
congress
to
raise
the
ceiling
on
benefits
for
civilian
unemployed
to
not
less
than
dollars
a
week
during
the
immediate
reconversion
period
i
suggested
that
the
congress
also
consider
liberalizing
veterans
allowances
elsewhere
in
this
message
i
reiterate
my
recommendation
with
respect
to
emergency
unemployment
compensation
i
also
recommend
increasing
veterans
unemployment
allowances
from
dollars
to
dollars
a
week
this
would
involve
additional
expenditures
estimated
at
approximately
million
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
included
in
the
budget
is
an
expenditure
of
million
dollars
for
veterans
education
under
provisions
of
the
servicemens
readjustment
act
this
amount
includes
both
tuition
expenses
and
maintenance
allowances
it
is
expected
that
half
a
million
veterans
will
be
enrolled
in
our
schools
and
colleges
during
the
year
the
ultimate
benefit
which
veterans
receive
from
the
loan
guarantee
provisions
of
the
servicemens
readjustment
act
depends
largely
on
the
success
of
our
stabilization
program
in
restraining
building
costs
and
real
estate
values
under
the
revised
procedure
contained
in
recent
amendments
the
administrative
workload
will
be
minimized
by
the
almost
complete
transfer
of
authority
for
approving
the
guarantees
to
private
lending
agencies
and
private
appraisers
designated
by
the
veterans
administration
this
authority
carries
with
it
the
responsibility
for
restricting
the
guarantees
to
loans
on
reasonably
valued
properties
costs
of
the
program
other
than
for
administration
are
estimated
at
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
pensions
for
veterans
will
require
expenditures
estimated
at
million
dollars
for
the
fiscal
year
twothirds
of
this
amount
will
be
received
by
veterans
of
the
war
which
we
have
just
won
this
figure
includes
million
dollars
of
increased
pen
sions
for
studentveterans
in
our
vocational
rehabilitation
program
in
addition
million
dollars
will
be
expended
in
transfers
to
the
national
service
life
insurance
fund
from
general
and
special
accounts
expenditures
under
the
appropriation
for
salaries
and
expenses
of
the
veterans
administration
are
estimated
at
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
this
includes
million
dollars
for
medical
care
and
the
operation
of
some
hospital
and
domiciliary
beds
a
separate
appropriation
for
hospital
and
domiciliary
facilities
additional
to
the
total
for
veterans
pensions
and
benefits
covers
construction
that
will
provide
some
hospital
beds
as
part
of
the
million
dollar
hospital
construction
program
already
authorized
by
the
congress
the
estimated
expenditures
of
million
dollars
for
this
purpose
are
classified
in
the
budget
as
part
of
the
general
public
works
program
for
the
next
fiscal
year
b
for
interest
interest
payments
on
the
public
debt
are
estimated
at
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
an
increase
of
million
dollars
from
the
revised
estimate
for
the
current
fiscal
year
this
increase
reflects
chiefly
payment
of
interest
on
additions
to
the
debt
this
year
assuming
continuance
of
present
interest
rates
the
governments
interest
bill
is
now
reaching
the
probable
postwar
level
c
for
refunds
an
estimated
total
of
million
dollars
of
refunds
will
be
paid
to
individuals
and
corporations
during
the
fiscal
year
slightly
over
half
of
this
amount
or
million
dollars
will
be
accessory
to
the
simplified
payasyougo
method
of
tax
collection
and
will
be
the
result
of
overwithholding
and
over
declaration
of
expected
income
most
of
the
remainder
will
arise
from
loss
and
excessprofits
credit

this
category
of

and
by
the
succeeding
year
will
reflect
almost
entirely
the
normal
operation
of

and
current
tax
collection
agricultural
programs
the
agricultural
programs
contemplated
for
the
fiscal
year
are
those
which
are
essential
for
the
provision
of
an
adequate
supply
of

other
agricultural
commodities
with
a
fair
return
to
american
farmers
to
support
these
objectives

by
the

estimated
at

million

in
the
two

to
provide
for

i
recommend
for

appropriations
of
million
dollars
including
the
existing

of
an

equal
to
percent
of
estimated

and
a
reappropriation
of
million

there
is
a

authorization
of
million

for
borrowing
from
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
for
the
loan
programs
of
the
farm
security

the
rural

it
is
expected
that
the

will
be
financed
during

the

for

purposes
a
supplemental
appropriation
to
restore
impaired
capital
of

and
the

authority
of

some
detailed
recommendations
follow
for
major

programs

am
recommending
that
million

land
resourcesthe
socalled
aaa
programfor
the
fiscal
year
compared
with
million
dollars
in
the
current
year
this
reduction
of
million
dollars
is
in
large
part
accounted
for
by
elimination
of
the
wartime
flax
production
incentive
project
and
other
nonrecurring
items
the
proposed
reduction
in
normal
activities
is
less
than
million
dollars
for
the
past
several
years
this
program
has
consisted
largely
of
payments
to
farmers
for
application
of
fertilizer
and
other
approved
soil
management
practices
i
am
convinced
that
farmers
generally
are
now
fully
alert
to
the
benefits
both
immediate
and
longterm
which
they
derive
from
the
practices
encouraged
by
this
program
i
believe
therefore
that
this
subsidization
should
continue
to
be
reduced
rural

is
proposed
that
the
loan
authorization
for
the
rural
electrification
administration
for
the
fiscal
year
be
increased
from
million
dollars
to
million
dollars
during
the

period
rea
was
limited
by
the
scarcity
of

and
manpower
but
that
situation
is
rapidly
changing
and
the
rea
program
which
was
materially
stepped
up
for
the
fiscal
year
can
be
increased
still
more
it
is
my
belief
that
a
feasible
and
practical
rural
electrification
program
should
be
carried
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
this
will
involve
total
loans
of
approximately
million
dollars
over
the
next
years
much
of
which
will
be
repaid
during
that
period
other

is
recommended
that
the
continuing
forest
landacquisition
program
be
resumed
at
the
rate
of
million

which
is
about
the
minimum
rate
at
which
this
program
can
be
economically
carried
on
the
lands
involved
in
this
program
can
contribute
fully
to
the
national
welfare

such
programs
as
those
of
the

are
estimated
to
be
continued
during
the
fiscal

at
about
the

level
as
in

i
have
recommended

legislation
is
now
pending
in

congress
to
authorize
grants
for
the

i
hope
the

the

provides
for
continuation
and
desirable
expansion
of
the
research
activities
that
are
carried
on
throughout
the
federal
establishment
and
through
previously
authorized
grants
to
the
states
additional
appropriations
will
be
required
for
the
proposed
central
federal
research
agency
which
i
recommended
last
september
that
agency
will
coordinate
existing
research
activities
and
administer
funds
for
new
research
activities
wherever
they
are
needed
it
will
not
itself
conduct
research
the
plan
contemplates
expenditures
through
the
new
research
agency
of
approximately
million
dollars
for
the
first
year
these
amounts
are
small
in
relation
to
the
important
contribution
they
can
make
to
the
national
income
the
welfare
of
our
people
and
the
common
defense
expenditures
must
be
limited
for
the
time
being
by
the
capacity
of
research
agencies
to
make
wise
use
of
funds
the
maintenance
of
our
position
as
a
nation
however
will
require
more
emphasis
on
research
expenditures
in
the
future
than
in
the
past
educational
expenditures
will
require
a
significant
share
of
the
national
income
in
the
fiscal
year
state
local
and
private
expenditures
for
the
current
support
of
elementary
secondary
and
higher
education
are
expected
to
be
substantially
above
billion
dollars
in
that
year
these
nonfederal
expenditures
will
be
supplemented
by
federal
expenditures
estimated
at
million
dollars
in
the
present
budget
of
this
amount
the
estimate
for
veterans
education
as
previously
mentioned
is
million

other

include

approximately
million

for
various
other
items
in
view
of
the
major
policy
issues
which
are
still
under
study
by
the
congress
and
the
administration
no
specific
amount
has
been
determined
for
the
federal
grants
previously
recommended
in
this
message
which
would
assist
the
states
generally
in
assuring
more
nearly
equal
opportunities
for
a
good
education
notwithstanding
the
urgent
need
for
additional
school
and
college
buildings
careful
planning
will
be
required
for
the
expenditures
to
be
made
under
the
proposed
legislation
to
aid
the
states
in
providing
educational
facilities
a
major
share
of
the
grants
for
the
first
year
would
be
for
surveys
and
plans
i
have
already
outlined
the
broad
objectives
of
our
foreign
economic
policy
in
the
present
section
i
shall
indicate
the
federal
outlays
which
the
execution
of
these
programs
may
require
in
the
fiscal
years
and
a
on
the
termination
of
lendlease
the
lendlease
countries
were
required
to
pay
for
goods
in
the
lendlease
pipe
line
either
in
cash
or
by
borrowing
from
the
united
states
or
by
supplying
goods
and
services
to
the
united
states
credits
for
this
purpose
have
already
been
extended
to
soviet
union
france
the
netherlands
and
belgium
amounting
to
million
dollars
the
settlement
credit
of
million
dollars
to
the
united
kingdom
includes
an
amount
preliminarily
fixed
at
million
dollars
which
represents
the
excess
of
purchases
by
the
united
kingdom
from
the
pipe
line
over
goods
and
services
supplied
by
the
united
kingdom
to
the
united
states
since
vjday
and
the
balance
of
various
claims
by
one
government
against
the
other
credits
are
also
being
negotiated
with
lendlease
countries
to
finance
the
disposition
of
lendlease
inventories
and
installations
and
property
declared
to
be
surplus
for
instance
million
dollars
of
the
settlement
credit
to
the
united
kingdom
is
for
this
purpose
these
credits
will
involve
no
new
expenditures
by
this
government
since
they
merely
provide
for
deferred
repayment
by
other
governments
for
good
services
which
have
been
financed
from
war
appropriations
b
expenditures
from
the
appropriations
to
united
nations
relief
and
rehabilitation
administration
which
were
discarded
under
war
expenditures
above
are
estimated
to
be
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
and
billion
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
c
to
assist
other
countries
in
the
restoration
of
their
economies
the
exportimport
bank
has
already
negotiated
loans
in
the
fiscal
year
amounting
in
total
to
about
million
dollars
and
an
additional
million
dollars
will
probably
be
committed
shortly
the
bank
is
also
granting
loans
to
carry
out
its
original
purpose
of
directly
expanding
the
foreign
trade
of
the
united
states
in
this
connection
the
bank
has
established
a
fund
of
million
dollars
to
finance
the
export
of
cotton
from
the
united
states
the
exportimport
bank
has
thus
loaned
or
committed
approximately
million
dollars
during
the
current
fiscal
year
and
it
is
expected
that
demands
on
its
resources
will
increase
in
the
last
months
of
the
fiscal
year
requests
for
loans
are
constantly
being
received
by
the
bank
from
countries
desiring
to
secure
goods
and
services
in
this
country
for
the
reconstruction
or
development
of
their
economies
on
july
the
lending
authority
of
the
expertimport
bank
was
increased
to
a
total
of
million
dollars
i
anticipate
that
during
the
period
covered
by
this
budget
the
bank
will
reach
this
limit
the
bulk
of
the
expenditures
from
the
loans
already
granted
will
fall
in
the
fiscal
year
while
the
bulk
of
the
expenditures
from
loans
yet
to
be
negotiated
will
fall
in
the
fiscal
year
in
view
of
the
urgent
need
for
the
banks
credit
i
may
find
it
necessary
to
request
a
further
increase
in
its
lending
authority
at
a
later
date
d
the
proposed
line
of
credit
of
million
dollars
to
the
united
kingdom
will
be
available
up
to
the
end
of
and
will
be
used
to
assist
the
united
kingdom
in
financing
the
deficit
in
its
balance
of
payments
during
the
transition
period
the
rate
at
which
the
united
kingdom
will
draw
on
the
credit
will
depend
on
the
rapidity
with
which
it
can
reconvert
its
economy
and
adapt
its
trade
to
the
postwar
world
the
anticipated
rate
of
expenditure
is
likely
to
be
heaviest
during
the
next
years
e
since
the
bretton

woods
agreements
have
now
been
approved
by
the
required
number
of
countries
both
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
international
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
will
commence
operations
during
the
organization
of
these
institutions
will
undoubtedly
take
some
time
and
it
is
unlikely
that
their
operations
will
reach
any
appreciable
scale
before
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
of
the
million
dollars
required
for
the
fund
million
dollars
will
be
provided
in
cash
or
notes
from
the
exchange
stabilization
fund
established
under
the
gold
reserve
act
of
the
remaining
million
dollars
will
be
paid
initially
in
the
form
of
noninterestbearing
notes
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
is
not
anticipated
that
the
fund
will
require
in
cash
any
of
the
million
dollars
during
the
fiscal
years
and
consequently
no
cash
withdrawals
from
the
treasury
will
be
required
in
connection
with
the
fund
in
these
years
the
subscription
to
the
bank
amounts
to
million
dollars
of
this
total
percent
must
be
paid
immediately
and
the
bank
is
required
to
call
a
further
percent
of
the
subscription
during
its
first
year
of
operations
the
balance
of
the
subscription
is
payable
when
required
by
the
bank
either
for
direct
lending
or
to
make
good
its
guarantees
it
is
likely
that
the
united
states
will
be
required
to
pay
little
if
any
more
than
the
initial
percent
before
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
i
anticipate
that
net
expenditures
of
the
exportimport
bank
and
expenditures
arising
from
the
british
credit
and
the
bretton
woods
agreements
will
amount
to
million
dollars
including
the
noncash
item
of
million
dollars
for
the
fund
in
the
fiscal
year
and
million
dollars
in
the
fiscal
year
general
government
the
responsibilities
of
the
government
in
both
domestic
and
international
affairs
have
increased
greatly
in
the
past
decade
consequently
the
government
is
larger
than
it
was
before
the
war
and
its
general
operating
costs
are
higher
we
cannot
shrink
the
government
to
prewar
dimensions
unless
we
slough
off
these
new
responsibilitiesand
we
cannot
do
that
without
paying
an
excessive
price
in
terms
of
our
national
welfare
we
can
however
enhance
its
operating
efficiency
through
improved
organization
i
expect
to
make
such
improvements
under
the
authority
of
the
reorganization
act
of
the
appropriations
which
i
am
recommending
for
general
government
for
the
fiscal
year
are
million
dollars
under
existing
legislation
this
is
an
increase
of
million
dollars
over
the
total
of
enacted
appropriations
for
the
current
fiscal
year
but
a
substantial
part
of
this
increase
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
appropriations
for
the
fiscal
year
were
made
prior
to
the
general
increase
of
employees
salaries
last
july
for
which
allowance
is
made
in
the
anticipated
supplemental
appropriations
for
the
recommended
total
for
for
general
government
like
the
estimates
for
national
defense
and
other
specific
programs
does
not
allow
for
the
further
salary
increases
for
government
employees
which
i
hope
will
be
authorized
by
pending
legislation
butthe
tentative
lumpsum
estimates
under
proposed
legislation
contemplate
that
such
salary
increases
will
be
effective
almost
at
once
expenditures
for
general
government
in
the
fiscal
year
are
expected
to
continue
the
slowly
rising
trend
which
began
in
this
category
includes
a
great
variety
of
itemsnot
merely
the
overhead
costs
of
the
government
it
includes
all
the
expenditures
of
the
cabinet
departments
other
than
for
national
defense
aids
to
agriculture
general
public
works
and
the
social
security
program
it
includes
also
expenditures
of
the
legislative
branch
the
judiciary
and
many
of
the
independent
agencies
of
the
executive
branch
consequently
the
estimated
increase
in
in
the
total
of
general
government
expenditures
reflects
a
variety
of
influences
now
included
in
general
government
are
certain
activities
formerly
classified
under
national
defense
some
of
these
such
as
certain
functions
of
the
former
foreign
economic
administration
and
the
war
manpower
commission
are
still
needed
during
the
period
of
reconversion
others
are
in
the
process
of
liquidation
a
few
wartime
activities
for
example
the
international
information
and
foreign
intelligence
services
and
some
of
the
wartime
programs
for
controlling
disease
and
crime
have
become
part
of
our
regular
government
establishment
expenditures
for
these
former
wartime
functions
explain
about
percent
of
the
increase
in
expenditures
for
general
government
other
increases
are
for
civil
aeronautics
promotion
the
business
and
manufacturing
censuses
and
other
expanded
business
services
of
the
department
of
commerce
which
have
been
referred
to
above
the
forest
and
soil
conservation
services
and
other
committees
of
the
department
of
certain
conservation
activities
of
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
collection
of
internal
revenue
in
the
treasury
department
the
necessity
for
reestablishing
postal
services
curtailed
during
the
war
and
advances
in
the
rates
of
pay
for
postal
employees
have
increased
substantially
the
estimated
expenditures
for
postal
service
for
both
the
current
and
the
next
fiscal
year
it
is
not
expected
that
this
increase
will
cause
expenditures
to
exceed
postal
revenues
in
either
year
although
an
excess
of
expenditures
may
occur
in
the
fiscal
year
if
salaries
are
increased
further
expenditures
for
our
share
of
the
administrative
budgets
of
the
united
nations
and
other
permanent
international
bodies
will
increase
sharply
in
the
fiscal
year
yet
will
remain
a
small
part
of
our
total
budget
the
budget
for
the
united
nations
has
not
yet
been
determined
an
estimate
for
our
contribution
will
be
submitted
later
our
contributions
to
the
food
and
agriculture
organization
the
international
labor
office
the
pan
american
union
and
other
similar
international
agencies
will
aggregate
about
million
dollars

we
have
won
a
great
warwe
the
nations
of
plain
people
who
hate
war
in
the
test
of
that
war
we
found
a
strength
of
unity
that
brought
us
througha
strength
that
crushed
the
power
of
those
who
sought
by
force
to
deny
our
faith
in
the
dignity
of
man
during
this
trial
the
voices
of
disunity
among
us
were
silent
or
were
subdued
to
an
occasional
whine
that
warned
us
that
they
were
still
among
us
those
voices
are
beginning
to
cry
aloud
again
we
must
learn
constantly
to
turn
deaf
ears
to
them
they
are
voices
which
foster
fear
and
suspicion
and
intolerance
and
hate
they
seek
to
destroy
our
harmony
our
understanding
of
each
other
our
american
tradition
of
live
and
let
live
they
have
become
busy
again
trying
to
set
race
against
race
creed
against
creed
farmer
against
city
dweller
worker
against
employer
people
against
their
own
governments
they
seek
only
to
do
us
mischief
they
must
not
prevail
it
should
be
impossible
for
any
man
to
contemplate
without
a
sense
of
personal
humility
the
tremendous
events
of
the
months
since
the
last
annual
message
the
great
tasks
that
confront
us
the
new
and
huge
problems
of
the
coming
months
and
years
yet
these
very
things
justify
the
deepest
confidence
in
the
future
of
this
nation
of
free
men
and
women
the
plain
people
of
this
country
found
the
courage
and
the
strength
the
selfdiscipline
and
the
mutual
respect
to
fight
and
to
win
with
the
help
of
our
allies
under
god
i
doubt
if
the
tasks
of
the
future
are
more
difficult
but
if
they
are
then
i
say
that
our
strength
and
our
knowledge
and
our
understanding
will
be
equal
to
those
tasks
as
printed
above
references
to
tables
appearing
in
the
budget
document
have
been

to
the
congress
in
considering
the
state
of
the
union
the
war
and
the
peace
that
is
to
follow
are
naturally
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
all
of
us
this
war
must
be
wagedit
is
being
wagedwith
the
greatest
and
most
persistent
intensity
everything
we
are
and
have
is
at
stake
everything
we
are
and
have
will
be
given
american
men
fighting
far
from
home
have
already
won
victories
which
the
world
will
never
forget
we
have
no
question
of
the
ultimate
victory
we
have
no
question
of
the
cost
our
losses
will
be
heavy
we
and
our
allies
will
go
on
fighting
together
to
ultimate
total
victory
we
have
seen
a
year
marked
on
the
whole
by
substantial
progress
toward
victory
even
though
the
year
ended
with
a
setback
for
our
arms
when
the
germans
launched
a
ferocious
counterattack
into
luxembourg
and
belgium
with
the
obvious
objective
of
cutting
our
line
in
the
center
our
men
have
fought
with
indescribable
and
unforgettable
gallantry
under
most
difficult
conditions
and
our
german
enemies
have
sustained
considerable
losses
while
failing
to
obtain
their
objectives
the
high
tide
of
this
german
effort
was
reached
two
days
after
christmas
since
then
we
have
reassumed
the
offensive
rescued
the
isolated
garrison
at
bastogne
and
forced
a
german
withdrawal
along
the
whole
line
of
the
salient
the
speed
with
which
we
recovered
from
this
savage
attack
was
largely
possible
because
we
have
one
supreme
commander
in
complete
control
of
all
the
allied
armies
in
france
general
eisenhower
has
faced
this
period
of
trial
with
admirable
calm
and
resolution
and
with
steadily
increasing
success
he
has
my
complete
confidence
further
desperate
attempts
may
well
be
made
to
break
our
lines
to
slow
our
progress
we
must
never
make
the
mistake
of
assuming
that
the
germans
are
beaten
until
the
last
nazi
has
surrendered
and
i
would
express
another
most
serious
warning
against
the
poisonous
effects
of
enemy
propaganda
the
wedge
that
the
germans
attempted
to
drive
in
western
europe
was
less
dangerous
in
actual
terms
of
winning
the
war
than
the
wedges
which
they
are
continually
attempting
to
drive
between
ourselves
and
our
allies
every
little
rumor
which
is
intended
to
weaken
our
faith
in
our
allies
is
like
an
actual
enemy
agent
in
our
midstseeking
to
sabotage
our
war
effort
there
are
here
and
there
evil
and
baseless
rumors
against
the
russiansrumors
against
the
britishrumors
against
our
own
american
commanders
in
the
field
when
you
examine
these
rumors
closely
you
will
observe
that
every
one
of
them
bears
the
same
trademarkmade
in
germany
we
must
resist
this
divisive
propagandawe
must
destroy
itwith
the
same
strength
and
the
same
determination
that
our
fighting
men
are
displaying
as
they
resist
and
destroy
the
panzer
divisions
in
europe
we
shall
resume
the
attack
anddespite
temporary
setbacks
here
or
therewe
shall
continue
the
attack
relentlessly
until
germany
is
completely
defeated
it
is
appropriate
at
this
time
to
review
the
basic
strategy
which
has
guided
us
through
three
years
of
war
and
which
will
lead
eventually
to
total
victory
the
tremendous
effort
of
the
first
years
of
this
war
was
directed
toward
the
concentration
of
men
and
supplies
in
the
various
theaters
of
action
at
the
points
where
they
could
hurt
our
enemies
most
it
was
an
effortin
the
language
of
the
military
menof
deployment
of
our
forces
many
battlesessential
battleswere
fought
many
victoriesvital
victorieswere
won
but
these
battles
and
these
victories
were
fought
and
won
to
hold
back
the
attacking
enemy
and
to
put
us
in
positions
from
which
we
and
our
allies
could
deliver
the
final
decisive
blows
in
the
beginning
our
most
important
military
task
was
to
prevent
our
enemiesthe
strongest
and
most
violently
aggressive
powers
that
ever
have
threatened
civilizationfrom
winning
decisive
victories
but
even
while
we
were
conducting
defensive
delaying
actions
we
were
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
we
could
wrest
the
initiative
from
our
enemies
and
place
our
superior
resources
of
men
and
materials
into
direct
competition
with
them
it
was
plain
then
that
the
defeat
of
either
enemy
would
require
the
massing
of
overwhelming
forcesground
sea
and
airin
positions
from
which
we
and
our
allies
could
strike
directly
against
the
enemy
homelands
and
destroy
the
nazi
and
japanese
war
machines
in
the
case
of
japan
we
had
to
await
the
completion
of
extensive
preliminary
operationsoperations
designed
to
establish
secure
supply
lines
through
the
japanese
outerzone
defenses
this
called
for
overwhelming
sea
power
and
air
powersupported
by
ground
forces
strategically
employed
against
isolated
outpost
garrisons
alwaysfrom
the
very
day
we
were
attackedit
was
right
militarily
as
well
as
morally
to
reject
the
arguments
of
those
shortsighted
people
who
would
have
had
us
throw
britain
and
russia
to
the
nazi
wolves
and
concentrate
against
the
japanese
such
people
urged
that
we
fight
a
purely
defensive
war
against
japan
while
allowing
the
domination
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
by
nazism
and
fascism
in
the
european
theater
the
necessary
bases
for
the
massing
of
ground
and
air
power
against
germany
were
already
available
in
great
britain
in
the
mediterranean
area
we
could
begin
ground
operations
against
major
elements
of
the
german
army
as
rapidly
as
we
could
put
troops
in
the
field
first
in
north
africa
and
then
in
italy
therefore
our
decision
was
made
to
concentrate
the
bulk
of
our
ground
and
air
forces
against
germany
until
her
utter
defeat
that
decision
was
based
on
all
these
factors
and
it
was
also
based
on
the
realization
that
of
our
two
enemies
germany
would
be
more
able
to
digest
quickly
her
conquests
the
more
able
quickly
to
convert
the
manpower
and
resources
of
her
conquered
territory
into
a
war
potential
we
had
in
europe
two
active
and
indomitable
alliesbritain
and
the
soviet
unionand
there
were
also
the
heroic
resistance
movements
in
the
occupied
countries
constantly
engaging
and
harassing
the
germans
we
cannot
forget
how
britain
held
the
line
alone
in
and
and
at
the
same
time
despite
ferocious
bombardment
from
the
air
built
up
a
tremendous
armaments
industry
which
enabled
her
to
take
the
offensive
at
el
alamein
in
we
cannot
forget
the
heroic
defense
of
moscow
and
leningrad
and
stalingrad
or
the
tremendous
russian
offensives
of
and
which
destroyed
formidable
german
armies
nor
can
we
forget
how
for
more
than
seven
long
years
the
chinese
people
have
been
sustaining
the
barbarous
attacks
of
the
japanese
and
containing
large
enemy
forces
on
the
vast
areas
of
the
asiatic
mainland
in
the
future
we
must
never
forget
the
lesson
that
we
have
learnedthat
we
must
have
friends
who
will
work
with
us
in
peace
as
they
have
fought
at
our
side
in
war
as
a
result
of
the
combined
effort
of
the
allied
forces
great
military
victories
were
achieved
in
the
liberation
of
france
belgium
greece
and
parts
of
the
netherlands
norway
poland
yugoslavia
and
czechoslovakia
the
surrender
of
rumania
and
bulgaria
the
invasion
of
germany
itself
and
hungary
the
steady
march
through
the
pacific
islands
to
the
philippines
guam
and
saipan
and
the
beginnings
of
a
mighty
air
offensive
against
the
japanese
islands
now
as
this
seventyninth
congress
meets
we
have
reached
the
most
critical
phase
of
the
war
the
greatest
victory
of
the
last
year
was
of
course
the
successful
breach
on
june
of
the
german
impregnable
seawall
of
europe
and
the
victorious
sweep
of
the
allied
forces
through
france
and
belgium
and
luxembourgalmost
to
the
rhine
itself
the
crosschannel
invasion
of
the
allied
armies
was
the
greatest
amphibious
operation
in
the
history
of
the
world
it
overshadowed
all
other
operations
in
this
or
any
other
war
in
its
immensity
its
success
is
a
tribute
to
the
fighting
courage
of
the
soldiers
who
stormed
the
beachesto
the
sailors
and
merchant
seamen
who
put
the
soldiers
ashore
and
kept
them
suppliedand
to
the
military
and
naval
leaders
who
achieved
a
real
miracle
of
planning
and
execution
and
it
is
also
a
tribute
to
the
ability
of
two
nations
britain
and
america
to
plan
together
and
work
together
and
fight
together
in
perfect
cooperation
and
perfect
harmony
this
crosschannel
invasion
was
followed
in
august
by
a
second
great
amphibious
operation
landing
troops
in
southern
france
in
this
the
same
cooperation
and
the
same
harmony
existed
between
the
american
french
and
other
allied
forces
based
in
north
africa
and
italy
the
success
of
the
two
invasions
is
a
tribute
also
to
the
ability
of
many
men
and
women
to
maintain
silence
when
a
few
careless
words
would
have
imperiled
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
thousands
and
would
have
jeopardized
the
whole
vast
undertakings
these
two
great
operations
were
made
possible
by
success
in
the
battle
of
the
atlantic
without
this
success
over
german
submarines
we
could
not
have
built
up
our
invasion
forces
or
air
forces
in
great
britain
nor
could
we
have
kept
a
steady
stream
of
supplies
flowing
to
them
after
they
had
landed
in
france
the
nazis
however
may
succeed
in
improving
their
submarines
and
their
crews
they
have
recently
increased
their
uboat
activity
the
battle
of
the
atlanticlike
all
campaigns
in
this
wardemands
eternal
vigilance
but
the
british
canadian
and
other
allied
navies
together
with
our
own
are
constantly
on
the
alert
the
tremendous
operations
in
western
europe
have
overshadowed
in
the
public
mind
the
less
spectacular
but
vitally
important
italian
front
its
place
in
the
strategic
conduct
of
the
war
in
europe
has
been
obscured
andby
some
people
unfortunatelyunderrated
it
is
important
that
any
misconception
on
that
score
be
correctednow
what
the
allied
forces
in
italy
are
doing
is
a
wellconsidered
part
in
our
strategy
in
europe
now
aimed
at
only
one
objectivethe
total
defeat
of
the
germans
these
valiant
forces
in
italy
are
continuing
to
keep
a
substantial
portion
of
the
german
army
under
constant
pressureincluding
some
firstline
german
divisions
and
the
necessary
supply
and
transport
and
replacement
troopsall
of
which
our
enemies
need
so
badly
elsewhere
over
very
difficult
terrain
and
through
adverse
weather
conditions
our
fi
fth
army
and
the
british
eighth
armyreinforced
by
units
from
other
united
nations
including
a
brave
and
well
equipped
unit
of
the
brazilian
armyhave
in
the
past
year
pushed
north
through
bloody
cassino
and
the
anzio
beachhead
and
through
rome
until
now
they
occupy
heights
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
po
the
greatest
tribute
which
can
be
paid
to
the
courage
and
fighting
ability
of
these
splendid
soldiers
in
italy
is
to
point
out
that
although
their
strength
is
about
equal
to
that
of
the
germans
they
oppose
the
allies
have
been
continuously
on
the
offensive
that
pressure
that
offensive
by
our
troops
in
italy
will
continue
the
american
peopleand
every
soldier
now
fighting
in
the
apenninesshould
remember
that
the
italian
front
has
not
lost
any
of
the
importance
which
it
had
in
the
days
when
it
was
the
only
allied
front
in
europe
in
the
pacific
during
the
past
year
we
have
conducted
the
fastestmoving
offensive
in
the
history
of
modern
warfare
we
have
driven
the
enemy
back
more
than
miles
across
the
central
pacific
a
year
ago
our
conquest
of
tarawa
was
a
little
more
than
a
month
old
a
year
ago
we
were
preparing
for
our
invasion
of
kwajalein
the
second
of
our
great
strides
across
the
central
pacific
to
the
philippines
a
year
ago
general
macarthur
was
still
fighting
in
new
guinea
almost
miles
from
his
present
position
in
the
philippine
islands
we
now
have
firmly
established
bases
in
the
mariana
islands
from
which
our
super
fortresses
bomb
tokyo
itselfand
will
continue
to
blast
japan
in
everincreasing
numbers
japanese
forces
in
the
philippines
have
been
cut
in
two
there
is
still
hard
fighting
aheadcostly
fighting
but
the
liberation
of
the
philippines
will
mean
that
japan
has
been
largely
cut
off
from
her
conquests
in
the
east
indies
the
landing
of
our
troops
on
leyte
was
the
largest
amphibious
operation
thus
far
conducted
in
the
pacific
moreover
these
landings
drew
the
japanese
fleet
into
the
first
great
sea
battle
which
japan
has
risked
in
almost
two
years
not
since
the
night
engagements
around
guadalcanal
in
novemberdecember
had
our
navy
been
able
to
come
to
grips
with
major
units
of
the
japanese
fleet
we
had
brushed
against
their
fleet
in
the
first
battle
of
the
philippine
sea
in
june
but
not
until
last
october
were
we
able
really
to
engage
a
major
portion
of
the
japanese
navy
in
actual
combat
the
naval
engagement
which
raged
for
three
days
was
the
heaviest
blow
ever
struck
against
japanese
sea
power
as
a
result
of
that
battle
much
of
what
is
left
of
the
japanese
fleet
has
been
driven
behind
the
screen
of
islands
that
separates
the
yellow
sea
the
china
sea
and
the
sea
of
japan
from
the
pacific
our
navy
looks
forward
to
any
opportunity
which
the
lords
of
the
japanese
navy
will
give
us
to
fight
them
again
the
people
of
this
nation
have
a
right
to
be
proud
of
the
courage
and
fighting
ability
of
the
men
in
the
armed
forceson
all
fronts
they
also
have
a
right
to
be
proud
of
american
leadership
which
has
guided
their
sons
into
battle
the
history
of
the
generalship
of
this
war
has
been
a
history
of
teamwork
and
cooperation
of
skill
and
daring
let
me
give
you
one
example
out
of
last
years
operations
in
the
pacific
last
september
admiral
halsey
led
american
naval
task
forces
into
philippine
waters
and
north
to
the
east
china
sea
and
struck
heavy
blows
at
japanese
air
and
sea
power
at
that
time
it
was
our
plan
to
approach
the
philippines
by
further
stages
taking
islands
which
we
may
call
a
c
and
e
however
admiral
halsey
reported
that
a
direct
attack
on
leyte
appeared
feasible
when
general
macarthur
received
the
reports
from
admiral
halseys
task
forces
he
also
concluded
that
it
might
be
possible
to
attack
the
japanese
in
the
philippines
directlybypassing
islands
a
c
and
e
admiral
nimitz
thereupon
offered
to
make
available
to
general
macarthur
several
divisions
which
had
been
scheduled
to
take
the
intermediate
objectives
these
discussions
conducted
at
great
distances
all
took
place
in
one
day
general
macarthur
immediately
informed
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
here
in
washington
that
he
was
prepared
to
initiate
plans
for
an
attack
on
leyte
in
october
approval
of
the
change
in
plan
was
given
on
the
same
day
thus
within
the
space
of
hours
a
major
change
of
plans
was
accomplished
which
involved
army
and
navy
forces
from
two
different
theaters
of
operationsa
change
which
hastened
the
liberation
of
the
philippines
and
the
final
day
of
victorya
change
which
saved
lives
which
would
have
been
expended
in
the
capture
of
islands
which
are
now
neutralized
far
behind
our
lines
our
overall
strategy
has
not
neglected
the
important
task
of
rendering
all
possible
aid
to
china
despite
almost
insuperable
difficulties
we
increased
this
aid
during
at
present
our
aid
to
china
must
be
accomplished
by
air
transportthere
is
no
other
way
by
the
end
of
the
air
transport
command
was
carrying
into
china
a
tonnage
of
supplies
three
times
as
great
as
that
delivered
a
year
ago
and
much
more
each
month
than
the
burma
road
ever
delivered
at
its
peak
despite
the
loss
of
important
bases
in
china
the
tonnage
delivered
by
air
transport
has
enabled
general
chennaults
fourteenth
air
force
which
includes
many
chinese
flyers
to
wage
an
effective
and
aggressive
campaign
against
the
japanese
in
aircraft
of
the
fourteenth
air
force
flew
more
than
sorties
against
the
japanese
and
sank
enormous
tonnage
of
enemy
shipping
greatly
diminishing
the
usefulness
of
the
china
sea
lanes
british
dominion
and
chinese
forces
together
with
our
own
have
not
only
held
the
line
in
burma
against
determined
japanese
attacks
but
have
gained
bases
of
considerable
importance
to
the
supply
line
into
china
the
burma
campaigns
have
involved
incredible
hardship
and
have
demanded
exceptional
fortitude
and
determination
the
officers
and
men
who
have
served
with
so
much
devotion
in
these
far
distant
jungles
and
mountains
deserve
high
honor
from
their
countrymen
in
all
of
the
farflung
operations
of
our
own
armed
forceson
land
and
sea
and
in
the
airthe
final
job
the
toughest
job
has
been
performed
by
the
average
easygoing
hardfighting
young
american
who
carries
the
weight
of
battle
on
his
own
shoulders
it
is
to
him
that
we
and
all
future
generations
of
americans
must
pay
grateful
tribute
butit
is
of
small
satisfaction
to
him
to
know
that
monuments
will
be
raised
to
him
in
the
future
he
wants
he
needs
and
he
is
entitled
to
insist
upon
our
full
and
active
supportnow
although
unprecedented
production
figures
have
made
possible
our
victories
we
shall
have
to
increase
our
goals
even
more
in
certain
items
peak
deliveries
of
supplies
were
made
to
the
war
department
in
december
due
in
part
to
cutbacks
we
have
not
produced
as
much
since
then
deliveries
of
army
supplies
were
down
by
percent
by
july
before
the
upward
trend
was
once
more
resumed
because
of
increased
demands
from
overseas
the
army
service
forces
in
the
month
of
october
had
to
increase
its
estimate
of
required
production
by
percent
but
in
november
one
month
later
the
requirements
for
had
to
be
increased
another
percent
sending
the
production
goal
well
above
anything
we
have
yet
attained
our
armed
forces
in
combat
have
steadily
increased
their
expenditure
of
medium
and
heavy
artillery
ammunition
as
we
continue
the
decisive
phases
of
this
war
the
munitions
that
we
expend
will
mount
day
by
day
in
october
while
some
were
saying
the
war
in
europe
was
over
the
army
was
shipping
more
men
to
europe
than
in
any
previous
month
of
the
war
one
of
the
most
urgent
immediate
requirements
of
the
armed
forces
is
more
nurses
last
april
the
army
requirement
for
nurses
was
set
at
actual
strength
in
nurses
was
then
since
that
time
the
army
has
tried
to
raise
the
additional
active
recruiting
has
been
carried
on
but
the
net
gain
in
eight
months
has
been
only
there
are
now
nurses
in
the
army
recent
estimates
have
increased
the
total
number
needed
to
that
means
that
more
nurses
must
be
obtained
for
the
army
alone
and
the
navy
now
requires
additional
nurses
the
present
shortage
of
army
nurses
is
reflected
in
undue
strain
on
the
existing
force
more
than
a
thousand
nurses
are
now
hospitalized
and
part
of
this
is
due
to
overwork
the
shortage
is
also
indicated
by
the
fact
that
army
hospital
units
have
been
sent
overseas
without
their
complement
of
nurses
at
army
hospitals
in
the
united
states
there
is
only
nurse
to
beds
instead
of
the
recommended
to
beds
it
is
tragic
that
the
gallant
women
who
have
volunteered
for
service
as
nurses
should
be
so
overworked
it
is
tragic
that
our
wounded
men
should
ever
want
for
the
best
possible
nursing
care
the
inability
to
get
the
needed
nurses
for
the
army
is
not
due
to
any
shortage
of
nurses
registered
nurses
are
now
practicing
in
this
country
it
has
been
estimated
by
the
war
manpower
commission
that
additional
nurses
could
be
made
available
to
the
armed
forces
without
interfering
too
seriously
with
the
needs
of
the
civilian
population
for
nurses
since
volunteering
has
not
produced
the
number
of
nurses
required
i
urge
that
the
selective
service
act
be
amended
to
provide
for
the
induction
of
nurses
into
the
armed
forces
the
need
is
too
pressing
to
await
the
outcome
of
further
efforts
at
recruiting
the
care
and
treatment
given
to
our
wounded
and
sick
soldiers
have
been
the
best
known
to
medical
science
those
standards
must
be
maintained
at
all
costs
we
cannot
tolerate
a
lowering
of
them
by
failure
to
provide
adequate
nursing
for
the
brave
men
who
stand
desperately
in
need
of
it
in
the
continuing
progress
of
this
war
we
have
constant
need
for
new
types
of
weapons
for
we
cannot
afford
to
fight
the
war
of
today
or
tomorrow
with
the
weapons
of
yesterday
for
example
the
american
army
now
has
developed
a
new
tank
with
a
gun
more
powerful
than
any
yet
mounted
on
a
fastmoving
vehicle
the
army
will
need
many
thousands
of
these
new
tanks
in
almost
every
month
finds
some
new
development
in
electronics
which
must
be
put
into
production
in
order
to
maintain
our
technical
superiorityand
in
order
to
save
lives
we
have
to
work
every
day
to
keep
ahead
of
the
enemy

in
radar
on
dday
in
france
with
our
superior
new
equipment
we
located
and
then
put
out
of
operation
every
warning
set
which
the
germans
had
along
the
french
coast
if
we
do
not
keep
constantly
ahead
of
our
enemies
in
the
development
of
new
weapons
we
pay
for
our
backwardness
with
the
lifes
blood
of
our
sons
the
only
way
to
meet
these
increased
needs
for
new
weapons
and
more
of
them
is
for
every
american
engaged
in
war
work
to
stay
on
his
war
jobfor
additional
american
civilians
men
and
women
not
engaged
in
essential
work
to
go
out
and
get
a
war
job
workers
who
are
released
because
their
production
is
cut
back
should
get
another
job
where
production
is
being
increased
this
is
no
time
to
quit
or
change
to
less
essential
jobs
there
is
an
old
and
true
saying
that
the
lord
hates
a
quitter
and
this
nation
must
pay
for
all
those
who
leave
their
essential
jobsor
all
those
who
lay
down
on
their
essential
jobs
for
nonessential
reasons
andagainthat
payment
must
be
made
with
the
lifes
blood
of
our
sons
many
critical
production
programs
with
sharply
rising
needs
are
now
seriously
hampered
by
manpower
shortages
the
most
important
army
needs
are
artillery
ammunition
cotton
duck
bombs
tires
tanks
heavy
trucks
and
even
bs
in
each
of
these
vital
programs
present
production
is
behind
requirements
navy
production
of
bombardment
ammunition
is
hampered
by
manpower
shortages
so
is
production
for
its
huge
rocket
program
labor
shortages
have
also
delayed
its
cruiser
and
carrier
programs
and
production
of
certain
types
of
aircraft
there
is
critical
need
for
more
repair
workers
and
repair
parts
this
jack
delays
the
return
of
damaged
fighting
ships
to
their
places
in
the
fleet
and
prevents
ships
now
in
the
fighting
line
from
getting
needed
overhauling
the
pool
of
young
men
under
classified
as
ia
is
almost
depleted
increased
replacements
for
the
armed
forces
will
take
men
now
deferred
who
are
at
work
in
war
industry
the
armed
forces
must
have
an
assurance
of
a
steady
flow
of
young
men
for
replacements
meeting
this
paramount
need
will
be
difficult
and
will
also
make
it
progressively
more
difficult
to
attain
the
production
goals
last
year
after
much
consideration
i
recommended
that
the
congress
adopt
a
national
service
act
as
the
most
efficient
and
democratic
way
of
insuring
full
production
for
our
war
requirements
this
recommendation
was
not
adopted
i
now
again
call
upon
the
congress
to
enact
this
measure
for
the
total
mobilization
of
all
our
human
resources
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
i
urge
that
this
be
done
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
it
is
not
too
late
in
the
war
in
fact
bitter
experience
has
shown
that
in
this
kind
of
mechanized
warfare
where
new
weapons
are
constantly
being
created
by
our
enemies
and
by
ourselves
the
closer
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
war
the
more
pressing
becomes
the
need
for
sustained
war
production
with
which
to
deliver
the
final
blow
to
the
enemy
there
are
three
basic
arguments
for
a
national
service
law
first
it
would
assure
that
we
have
the
right
numbers
of
workers
in
the
right
places
at
the
right
times
second
it
would
provide
supreme
proof
to
all
our
fighting
men
that
we
are
giving
them
what
they
are
entitled
to
which
is
nothing
less
than
our
total
effort
and
third
it
would
be
the
final
unequivocal
answer
to
the
hopes
of
the
nazis
and
the
japanese
that
we
may
become
halfhearted
about
this
war
and
that
they
can
get
from
us
a
negotiated
peace
national
service
legislation
would
make
it
possible
to
put
ourselves
in
a
position
to
assure
certain
and
speedy
action
in
meeting
our
manpower
needs
it
would
be
used
only
to
the
extent
absolutely
required
by
military
necessities
in
fact
experience
in
great
britain
and
in
other
nations
at
war
indicates
that
use
of
the
compulsory
powers
of
national
service
is
necessary
only
in
rare
instances
this
proposed
legislation
would
provide
against
loss
of
retirement
and
seniority
rights
and
benefits
it
would
not
mean
reduction
in
wages
in
adopting
such
legislation
it
is
not
necessary
to
discard
the
voluntary
and
cooperative
processes
which
have
prevailed
up
to
this
time
this
cooperation
has
already
produced
great
results
the
contribution
of
our
workers
to
the
war
effort
has
been
beyond
measure
we
must
build
on
the
foundations
that
have
already
been
laid
and
supplement
the
measures
now
in
operation
in
order
to
guarantee
the
production
that
may
be
necessary
in
the
critical
period
that
lies
ahead
at
the
present
time
we
are
using
the
inadequate
tools
at
hand
to
do
the
best
we
can
by
such
expedients
as
manpower
ceilings
and
the
use
of
priority
and
other
powers
to
induce
men
and
women
to
shift
from
nonessential
to
essential
war
jobs
i
am
in
receipt
of
a
joint
letter
from
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
dated
january
which
says
with
the
experience
of
three
years
of
war
and
after
the
most
thorough
consideration
we
are
convinced
that
it
is
now
necessary
to
carry
out
the
statement
made
by
the
congress
in
the
joint
resolutions
declaring
that
a
state
of
war
existed
with
japan
and
germany
that
to
bring
the
conflict
to
a
successful
conclusion
all
of
the
resources
of
the
country
are
hereby
pledged
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
our
considered
judgment
which
is
supported
by
general
marshall
and
admiral
king
this
requires
total
mobilization
of
our
manpower
by
the
passage
of
a
national
war
service
law
the
armed
forces
need
this
legislation
to
hasten
the
day
of
final
victory
and
to
keep
to
a
minimum
the
cost
in
lives
national
war
service
the
recognition
by
law
of
the
duty
of
every
citizen
to
do
his
or
her
part
in
winning
the
war
will
give
complete
assurance
that
the
need
for
war
equipment
will
be
filled
in
the
coming
year
we
must
increase
the
output
of
many
weapons
and
supplies
on
short
notice
otherwise
we
shall
not
keep
our
production
abreast
of
the
swiftly
changing
needs
of
war
at
the
same
time
it
will
be
necessary
to
draw
progressively
many
men
now
engaged
in
war
production
to
serve
with
the
armed
forces
and
their
places
in
war
production
must
be
filled
promptly
these
developments
will
require
the
addition
of
hundreds
of
thousands
to
those
already
working
in
war
industry
we
do
not
believe
that
these
needs
can
be
met
effectively
under
present
methods
the
record
made
by
management
and
labor
in
war
industry
has
been
a
notable
testimony
to
the
resourcefulness
and
power
of
america
the
needs
are
so
great
nevertheless
that
in
many
instances
we
have
been
forced
to
recall
soldiers
and
sailors
from
military
duty
to
do
work
of
a
civilian
character
in
war
production
because
of
the
urgency
of
the
need
for
equipment
and
because
of
inability
to
recruit
civilian
labor
pending
action
by
the
congress
on
the
broader
aspects
of
national
service
i
recommend
that
the
congress
immediately
enact
legislation
which
will
be
effective
in
using
the
services
of
the
men
now
classified
as
ivf
in
whatever
capacity
is
best
for
the
war
effort
in
the
field
of
foreign
policy
we
propose
to
stand
together
with
the
united
nations
not
for
the
war
alone
but
for
the
victory
for
which
the
war
is
fought
it
is
not
only
a
common
danger
which
unites
us
but
a
common
hope
ours
is
an
association
not
of
governments
but
of
peoplesand
the
peoples
hope
is
peace
here
as
in
england
in
england
as
in
russia
in
russia
as
in
china
in
france
and
through
the
continent
of
europe
and
throughout
the
world
wherever
men
love
freedom
the
hope
and
purpose
of
the
people
are
for
peacea
peace
that
is
durable
and
secure
it
will
not
be
easy
to
create
this
peoples
peace
we
delude
ourselves
if
we
believe
that
the
surrender
of
the
armies
of
our
enemies
will
make
the
peace
we
long
for
the
unconditional
surrender
of
the
armies
of
our
enemies
is
the
first
and
necessary
stepbut
the
first
step
only
we
have
seen
already
in
areas
liberated
from
the
nazi
and
the
fascist
tyranny
what
problems
peace
will
bring
and
we
delude
ourselves
if
we
attempt
to
believe
wishfully
that
all
these
problems
can
be
solved
overnight
the
firm
foundation
can
be
builtand
it
will
be
built
but
the
continuance
and
assurance
of
a
living
peace
must
in
the
long
run
be
the
work
of
the
people
themselves
we
ourselves
like
all
peoples
who
have
gone
through
the
difficult
processes
of
liberation
and
adjustment
know
of
our
own
experience
how
great
the
difficulties
can
be
we
know
that
they
are
not
difficulties
peculiar
to
any
continent
or
any
nation
our
own
revolutionary
war
left
behind
it
in
the
words
of
one
american
historian
an
eddy
of
lawlessness
and
disregard
of
human
life
there
were
separatist
movements
of
one
kind
or
another
in
vermont
pennsylvania
virginia
tennessee
kentucky
and
maine
there
were
insurrections
open
or
threatened
in
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
these
difficulties
we
worked
out
for
ourselves
as
the
peoples
of
the
liberated
areas
of
europe
faced
with
complex
problems
of
adjustment
will
work
out
their
difficulties
for
themselves
peace
can
be
made
and
kept
only
by
the
united
determination
of
free
and
peaceloving
peoples
who
are
willing
to
work
togetherwilling
to
help
one
anotherwilling
to
respect
and
tolerate
and
try
to
understand
one
anothers
opinions
and
feelings
the
nearer
we
come
to
vanquishing
our
enemies
the
more
we
inevitably
become
conscious
of
differences
among
the
victors
we
must
not
let
those
differences
divide
us
and
blind
us
to
our
more
important
common
and
continuing
interests
in
winning
the
war
and
building
the
peace
international
cooperation
on
which
enduring
peace
must
be
based
is
not
a
oneway
street
nations

not
always
see
alike
or
think
alike
and
international
cooperation
and
progress
are
not
helped
by
any
nation
assuming
that
it
has
a
monopoly
of
wisdom
or
of
virtue
in
the
future
world
the
misuse
of
power
as
implied
in
the
term
power
politics
must
not
be
a
controlling
factor
in
international
relations
that
is
the
heart
of
the
principles
to
which
we
have
subscribed
we
cannot
deny
that
power
is
a
factor
in
world
politics
any
more
than
we
can
deny
its
existence
as
a
factor
in
national
politics
but
in
a
democratic
world
as
in
a
de
mocratic
nation
power
must
be
linked
with
responsibility
and
obliged
to
defend
and
justify
itself
within
the
framework
of
the
general
good
perfectionism
no
less
than
isolationism
or
imperialism
or
power
politics
may
obstruct
the
paths
to
international
peace
let
us
not
forget
that
the
retreat
to
isolationism
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
was
started
not
by
a
direct
attack
against
international
cooperation
but
against
the
alleged
imperfections
of
the
peace
in
our
disillusionment
after
the
last
war
we
preferred
international
anarchy
to
international
cooperation
with
nations
which
did
not
see
and
think
exactly
as
we
did
we
gave
up
the
hope
of
gradually
achieving
a
better
peace
because
we
had
not
the
courage
to
fulfill
our
responsibilities
in
an
admittedly
imperfect
world
we
must
not
let
that
happen
again
or
we
shall
follow
the
same
tragic
road
againthe
road
to
a
third
world
war
we
can
fulfill
our
responsibilities
for
maintaining
the
security
of
our
own
country
only
by
exercising
our
power
and
our
influence
to
achieve
the
principles
in
which
we
believe
and
for
which
we
have
fought
in
august
prime
minister
churchill
and
i
agreed
to
the
principles
of
the
atlantic
charter
these
being
later
incorporated
into
the
declaration
by
united
nations
of
january
at
that
time
certain
isolationists
protested
vigorously
against
our
right
to
proclaim
the
principlesand
against
the
very
principles
themselves
today
many
of
the
same
people
are
protesting
against
the
possibility
of
violation
of
the
same
principles
it
is
true
that
the
statement
of
principles
in
the
atlantic
charter
does
not
provide
rules
of
easy
application
to
each
and
every
one
of
this
wartorn
worlds
tangled
situations
but
it
is
a
good
and
a
useful
thing
it
is
an
essential
thingto
have
principles
toward
which
we
can
aim
and
we
shall
not
hesitate
to
use
our
influenceand
to
use
it
nowto
secure
so
far
as
is
humanly
possible
the
fulfillment
of
the
principles
of
the
atlantic
charter
we
have
not
shrunk
from
the
military
responsibilities
brought
on
by
this
war
we
cannot
and
will
not
shrink
from
the
political
responsibilities
which
follow
in
the
wake
of
battle
i
do
not
wish
to
give
the
impression
that
all
mistakes
can
be
avoided
and
that
many
disappointments
are
not
inevitable
in
the
making
of
peace
but
we
must
not
this
time
lose
the
hope
of
establishing
an
international
order
which
will
be
capable
of
maintaining
peace
and
realizing
through
the
years
more
perfect
justice
between
nations
to
do
this
we
must
be
on
our
guard
not
to
exploit
and
exaggerate
the
differences
between
us
and
our
allies
particularly
with
reference
to
the
peoples
who
have
been
liberated
from
fascist
tyranny
that
is
not
the
way
to
secure
a
better
settlement
of
those
differences
or
to
secure
international
machinery
which
can
rectify
mistakes
which
may
be
made
i
should
not
be
frank
if
i
did
not
admit
concern
about
many
situationsthe
greek
and
polish
for
example
but
those
situations
are
not
as
easy
or
as
simple
to
deal
with
as
some
spokesmen
whose
sincerity
i
do
not
question
would
have
us
believe
we
have
obligations
not
necessarily
legal
to
the
exiled
governments
to
the
underground
leaders
and
to
our
major
allies
who
came
much
nearer
the
shadows
than
we
did
we
and
our
allies
have
declared
that
it
is
our
purpose
to
respect
the
right
of
all
peoples
to
choose
the
form
of
government
under
which
they
will
live
and
to
see
sovereign
rights
and
selfgovernment
restored
to
those
who
have
been
forcibly
deprived
of
them
but
with
internal
dissension
with
many
citizens
of
liberated
countries
still
prisoners
of
war
or
forced
to
labor
in
germany
it
is
difficult
to
guess
the
kind
of
selfgovernment
the
people
really
want
during
the
interim
period
until
conditions
permit
a
genuine
expression
of
the
peoples
will
we
and
our
allies
have
a
duty
which
we
cannot
ignore
to
use
our
influence
to
the
end
that
no
temporary
or
provisional
authorities
in
the
liberated
countries
block
the
eventual
exercise
of
the
peoples
right
freely
to
choose
the
government
and
institutions
under
which
as
freemen
they
are
to
live
it
is
only
too
easy
for
all
of
us
to
rationalize
what
we
want
to
believe
and
to
consider
those
leaders
we
like
responsible
and
those
we
dislike
irresponsible
and
our
task
is
not
helped
by
stubborn
partisanship
however
understandable
on
the
part
of
opposed
internal
factions
it
is
our
purpose
to
help
the
peaceloving
peoples
of
europe
to
live
together
as
good
neighbors
to
recognize
their
common
interests
and
not
to
nurse
their
traditional
grievances
against
one
another
but
we
must
not
permit
the
many
specific
and
immediate
problems
of
adjustment
connected
with
the
liberation
of
europe
to
delay
the
establishment
of
permanent
machinery
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
under
the
threat
of
a
common
danger
the
united
nations
joined
together
in
war
to
preserve
their
independence
and
their
freedom
they
must
now
join
together
to
make
secure
the
independence
and
freedom
of
all
peaceloving
states
so
that
never
again
shall
tyranny
be
able
to
divide
and
conquer
international
peace
and
wellbeing
like
national
peace
and
wellbeing
require
constant
alertness
continuing
cooperation
and
organized
effort
international
peace
and
wellbeing
like
national
peace
and
wellbeing
can
be
secured
only
through
institutions
capable
of
life
and
growth
many
of
the
problems
of
the
peace
are
upon
us
even
now
while
the
conclusion
of
the
war
is
still
before
us
the
atmosphere
of
friendship
and
mutual
understanding
and
determination
to
find
a
common
ground
of
common
understanding
which
surrounded
the
conversations
at
dumbarton
oaks
gives
us
reason
to
hope
that
future
discussions
will
succeed
in
developing
the
democratic
and
fully
integrated
world
security
system
toward
which
these
preparatory
conversations
were
directed
we
and
the
other
united
nations
are
going
forward
with
vigor
and
resolution
in
our
efforts
to
create
such
a
system
by
providing
for
it
strong
and
flexible
institutions
of
joint
and
cooperative
action
the
aroused
conscience
of
humanity
will
not
permit
failure
in
this
supreme
endeavor
we
believe
that
the
extraordinary
advances
in
the
means
of
intercommunication
between
peoples
over
the
past
generation
offer
a
practical
method
of
advancing
the
mutual
understanding
upon
which
peace
and
the
institutions
of
peace
must
rest
and
it
is
our
policy
and
purpose
to
use
these
great
technological
achievements
for
the
common
advantage
of
the
world
we
support
the
greatest
possible
freedom
of
trade
and
commerce
we
americans
have
always
believed
in
freedom
of
opportunity
and
equality
of
opportunity
remains
one
of
the
principal
objectives
of
our
national
life
what
we
believe
in
for
individuals
we
believe
in
also
for
nations
we
are
opposed
to
restrictions
whether
by
public
act
or
private
arrangement
which
distort
and
impair
commerce
transit
and
trade
we
have
housecleaning
of
our
own
to
do
in
this
regard
but
it
is
our
hope
not
only
in
the
interest
of
our
own
prosperity
but
in
the
interest
of
the
prosperity
of
the
world
that
trade
and
commerce
and
access
to
materials
and
markets
may
be
freer
after
this
war
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
one
of
the
most
heartening
events
of
the
year
in
the
international
field
has
been
the
renaissance
of
the
french
people
and
the
return
of
the
french
nation
to
the
ranks
of
the
united
nations
far
from
having
been
crushed
by
the
terror
of
nazi
domination
the
french
people
have
emerged
with
stronger
faith
than
ever
in
the
destiny
of
their
country
and
in
the
soundness
of
the
democratic
ideals
to
which
the
french
nation
has
traditionally
contributed
so
greatly
during
her
liberation
france
has
given
proof
of
her
unceasing
determination
to
fight
the
germans
continuing
the
heroic
efforts
of
the
resistance
groups
under
the
occupation
and
of
all
those
frenchmen
throughout
the
world
who
refused
to
surrender
after
the
disaster
of
today
french
armies
are
again
on
the
german
frontier
and
are
again
fighting
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
our
sons
since
our
landings
in
africa
we
have
placed
in
french
hands
all
the
arms
and
material
of
war
which
our
resources
and
the
military
situation
permitted
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
we
are
now
about
to
equip
large
new
french
forces
with
the
most
modern
weapons
for
combat
duty
in
addition
to
the
contribution
which
france
can
make
to
our
common
victory
her
liberation
likewise
means
that
her
great
influence
will
again
be
available
in
meeting
the
problems
of
peace
we
fully
recognize
frances
vital
interest
in
a
lasting
solution
of
the
german
problem
and
the
contribution
which
she
can
make
in
achieving
international
security
her
formal
adherence
to
the
declaration
by
united
nations
a
few
days
ago
and
the
proposal
at
the
dumbarton
oaks
discussions
whereby
france
would
receive
one
of
the
five
permanent
seats
in
the
proposed
security
council
demonstrate
the
extent
to
which
france
has
resumed
her
proper
position
of
strength
and
leadership
i
am
clear
in
my
own
mind
that
as
an
essential
factor
in
the
maintenance
of
peace
in
the
future
we
must
have
universal
military
training
after
this
war
and
i
shall
send
a
special
message
to
the
congress
on
this
subject
an
enduring
peace
cannot
be
achieved
without
a
strong
americastrong
in
the
social
and
economic
sense
as
well
as
in
the
military
sense
in
the
state
of
the
union
message
last
year
i
set
forth
what
i
considered
to
be
an
american
economic
bill
of
rights
i
said
then
and
i
say
now
that
these
economic
truths
represent
a
second
bill
of
rights
under
which
a
new
basis
of
security
and
prosperity
can
be
established
for
allregardless
of
station
race
or
creed
of
these
rights
the
most
fundamental
and
one
on
which
the
fulfillment
of
the
others
in
large
degree
depends
is
the
right
to
a
useful
and
remunerative
job
in
the
industries
or
shops
or
farms
or
mines
of
the
nation
in
turn
others
of
the
economic
rights
of
american
citizenship
such
as
the
right
to
a
decent
home
to
a
good
education
to
good
medical
care
to
social
security
to
reasonable
farm
income
will
if
fulfilled
make
major
contributions
to
achievin
g
adequate
levels
of
employment
the
federal
government
must
see
to
it
that
these
rights
become
realitieswith
the
help
of
states
municipalities
business
labor
and
agriculture
we
have
had
full
employment
during
the
war
we
have
had
it
because
the
government
has
been
ready
to
buy
all
the
materials
of
war
which
the
country
could
produceand
this
has
amounted
to
approximately
half
our
present
productive
capacity
after
the
war
we
must
maintain
full
employment
with
government
performing
its
peacetime
functions
this
means
that
we
must
achieve
a
level
of
demand
and
purchasing
power
by
private
consumersfarmers
businessmen
workers
professional
men
housewiveswhich
is
sufficiently
high
to
replace
wartime
government
demands
and
it
means
also
that
we
must
greatly
increase
our
export
trade
above
the
prewar
level
our
policy
is
of
course
to
rely
as
much
as
possible
on
private
enterprise
to
provide
jobs
but
the
american
people
will
not
accept
mass
unemployment
or
mere
makeshift
work
there
will
be
need
for
the
work
of
everyone
willing
and
able
to
workand
that
means
close
to
jobs
full
employment
means
not
only
jobsbut
productive
jobs
americans
do
not
regard
jobs
that
pay
substandard
wages
as
productive
jobs
we
must
make
sure
that
private
enterprise
works
as
it
is
supposed
to
work
on
the
basis
of
initiative
and
vigorous
competition
without
the
stifling
presence
of
monopolies
and
cartels
during
the
war
we
have
guaranteed
investment
in
enterprise
essential
to
the
war
effort
we
should
also
take
appropriate
measures
in
peacetime
to
secure
opportunities
for
new
small
enterprises
and
for
productive
business
expansion
for
which
finance
would
otherwise
be
unavailable
this
necessary
expansion
of
our
peacetime
productive
capacity
will
require
new
facilities
new
plants
and
new
equipment
it
will
require
large
outlays
of
money
which
should
be
raised
through
normal
investment
channels
but
while
private
capital
should
finance
this
expansion
program
the
government
should
recognize
its
responsibility
for
sharing
part
of
any
special
or
abnormal
risk
of
loss
attached
to
such
financing
our
fullemployment
program
requires
the
extensive
development
of
our
natural
resources
and
other
useful
public
works
the
undeveloped
resources
of
this
continent
are
still
vast
our
riverwatershed
projects
will
add
new
and
fertile
territories
to
the
united
states
the
tennessee
valley
authority
which
was
constructed
at
a
cost
of
the
cost
of
waging
this
war
for
less
than
dayswas
a
bargain
we
have
similar
opportunities
in
our
other
great
river
basins
by
harnessing
the
resources
of
these
river
basins
as
we
have
in
the
tennessee
valley
we
shall
provide
the
same
kind
of
stimulus
to
enterprise
as
was
provided
by
the
louisiana
purchase
and
the
new
discoveries
in
the
west
during
the
nineteenth
century
if
we
are
to
avail
ourselves
fully
of
the
benefits
of
civil
aviation
and
if
we
are
to
use
the
automobiles
we
can
produce
it
will
be
necessary
to
construct
thousands
of
airports
and
to
overhaul
our
entire
national
highway
system
the
provision
of
a
decent
home
for
every
family
is
a
national
necessity
if
this
country
is
to
be
worthy
of
its
greatnessand
that
task
will
itself
create
great
employment
opportunities
most
of
our
cities
need
extensive
rebuilding
much
of
our
farm
plant
is
in
a
state
of
disrepair
to
make
a
frontal
attack
on
the
problems
of
housing
and
urban
reconstruction
will
require
thoroughgoing
cooperation
between
industry
and
labor
and
the
federal
state
and
local
governments
an
expanded
social
security
program
and
adequate
health
and
education
programs
must
play
essential
roles
in
a
program
designed
to
support
individual
productivity
and
mass
purchasing
power
i
shall
communicate
further
with
the
congress
on
these
subjects
at
a
later
date
the
millions
of
productive
jobs
that
a
program
of
this
nature
could
bring
are
jobs
in
private
enterprise
they
are
jobs
based
on
the
expanded
demand
for
the
output
of
our
economy
for
consumption
and
investment
through
a
program
of
this
character
we
can
maintain
a
national
income
high
enough
to
provide
for
an
orderly
retirement
of
the
public
debt
along
with
reasonable
tax
reduction
our
present
tax
system
geared
primarily
to
war
requirements
must
be
revised
for
peacetime
so
as
to
encourage
private
demand
while
no
general
revision
of
the
tax
structure
can
be
made
until
the
war
ends
on
all
fronts
the
congress
should
be
prepared
to
provide
tax
modifications
at
the
end
of
the
war
in
europe
designed
to
encourage
capital
to
invest
in
new
enterprises
and
to
provide
jobs
as
an
integral
part
of
this
program
to
maintain
high
employment
we
must
after
the
war
is
over
reduce
or
eliminate
taxes
which
bear
too
heavily
on
consumption
the
war
will
leave
deep
disturbances
in
the
world
economy
in
our
national
economy
in
many
communities
in
many
families
and
in
many
individuals
it
will
require
determined
effort
and
responsible
action
of
all
of
us
to
find
our
way
back
to
peacetime
and
to
help
others
to
find
their
way
back
to
peacetimea
peacetime
that
holds
the
values
of
the
past
and
the
promise
of
the
future
if
we
attack
our
problems
with
determination
we
shall
succeed
and
we
must
succeed
for
freedom
and
peace
cannot
exist
without
security
during
the
past
year
the
american
people
in
a
national
election
reasserted
their
democratic
faith
in
the
course
of
that
campaign
various
references
were
made
to
strife
between
this
administration
and
the
congress
with
the
implication
if
not
the
direct
assertion
that
this
administration
and
the
congress
could
never
work
together
harmoniously
in
the
service
of
the
nation
it
cannot
be
denied
that
there
have
been
disagreements
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branchesas
there
have
been
disagreements
during
the
past
century
and
a
half
i
think
we
all
realize
too
that
there
are
some
people
in
this
capital
city
whose
task
is
in
large
part
to
stir
up
dissension
and
to
magnify
normal
healthy
disagreements
so
that
they
appear
to
be
irreconcilable
conflicts
buti
think
that
the
overall
record
in
this
respect
is
eloquent
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
americaall
branches
of
ithas
a
good
record
of
achievement
in
this
war
the
congress
the
executive
and
the
judiciary
have
worked
together
for
the
common
good
i
myself
want
to
tell
you
the
members
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
how
happy
i
am
in
our
relationships
and
friendships
i
have
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
some
of
the
new
members
in
each
house
but
i
hope
that
opportunity
will
offer
itself
in
the
near
future
we
have
a
great
many
problems
ahead
of
us
and
we
must
approach
them
with
realism
and
courage
this
new
year
of
can
be
the
greatest
year
of
achievement
in
human
history
nineteen
fortyfive
can
see
the
final
ending
of
the
nazifascist
reign
of
terror
in
europe
nineteen
fortyfive
can
see
the
closing
in
of
the
forces
of
retribution
about
the
center
of
the
malignant
power
of
imperialistic
japan
most
important
of
all
can
and
must
see
the
substantial
beginning
of
the
organization
of
world
peace
this
organization
must
be
the
fulfillment
of
the
promise
for
which
men
have
fought
and
died
in
this
war
it
must
be
the
justification
of
all
the
sacrifices
that
have
been
madeof
all
the
dreadful
misery
that
this
world
has
endured
we
americans
of
today
together
with
our
allies
are
making
historyand
i
hope
it
will
be
better
history
than
ever
has
been
made
before
we
pray
that
we
may
be
worthy
of
the
unlimited
opportunities
that
god
has
given
us

to
the
congress
this
nation
in
the
past
two
years
has
become
an
active
partner
in
the
worlds
greatest
war
against
human
slavery
we
have
joined
with
likeminded
people
in
order
to
defend
ourselves
in
a
world
that
has
been
gravely
threatened
with
gangster
rule
but
i
do
not
think
that
any
of
us
americans
can
be
content
with
mere
survival
sacrifices
that
we
and
our
allies
are
making
impose
upon
us
all
a
sacred
obligation
to
see
to
it
that
out
of
this
war
we
and
our
children
will
gain
something
better
than
mere
survival
we
are
united
in
determination
that
this
war
shall
not
be
followed
by
another
interim
which
leads
to
new
disasterthat
we
shall
not
repeat
the
tragic
errors
of
ostrich
isolationismthat
we
shall
not
repeat
the
excesses
of
the
wild
twenties
when
this
nation
went
for
a
joy
ride
on
a
roller
coaster
which
ended
in
a
tragic
crash
when
mr
hull
went
to
moscow
in
october
and
when
i
went
to
cairo
and
teheran
in
november
we
knew
that
we
were
in
agreement
with
our
allies
in
our
common
determination
to
fight
and
win
this
war
but
there
were
many
vital
questions
concerning
the
future
peace
and
they
were
discussed
in
an
atmosphere
of
complete
candor
and
harmony
in
the
last
war
such
discussions
such
meetings
did
not
even
begin
until
the
shooting
had
stopped
and
the
delegates
began
to
assemble
at
the
peace
table
there
had
been
no
previous
opportunities
for
mantoman
discussions
which
lead
to
meetings
of
minds
the
result
was
a
peace
which
was
not
a
peace
that
was
a
mistake
which
we
are
not
repeating
in
this
war
and
right
here
i
want
to
address
a
word
or
two
to
some
suspicious
souls
who
are
fearful
that
mr
hull
or
i
have
made
commitments
for
the
future
which
might
pledge
this
nation
to
secret
treaties
or
to
enacting
the
role
of
santa
claus
to
such
suspicious
soulsusing
a
polite
terminologyi
wish
to
say
that
mr
churchill
and
marshal
stalin
and
generalissimo
chiang
kaishek
are
all
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
provisions
of
our
constitution
and
so
is
mr
hull
and
so
am
i
of
course
we
made
some
commitments
we
most
certainly
committed
ourselves
to
very
large
and
very
specific
military
plans
which
require
the
use
of
all
allied
forces
to
bring
about
the
defeat
of
our
enemies
at
the
earliest
possible
time
but
there
were
no
secret
treaties
or
political
or
financial
commitments
the
one
supreme
objective
for
the
future
which
we
discussed
for
each
nation
individually
and
for
all
the
united
nations
can
be
summed
up
in
one
word
security
and
that
means
not
only
physical
security
which
provides
safety
from
attacks
by
aggressors
it
means
also
economic
security
social
security
moral
securityin
a
family
of
nations
in
the
plain
downtoearth
talks
that
i
had
with
the
generalissimo
and
marshal
stalin
and
prime
minister
churchill
it
was
abundantly
clear
that
they
are
all
most
deeply
interested
in
the
resumption
of
peaceful
progress
by
their
own
peoplesprogress
toward
a
better
life
all
our
allies
want
freedom
to
develop
their
lands
and
resources
to
build
up
industry
to
increase
education
and
individual
opportunity
and
to
raise
standards
of
living
all
our
allies
have
learned
by
bitter
experience
that
real
development
will
not
be
possible
if
they
are
to
be
diverted
from
their
purpose
by
repeated
warsor
even
threats
of
war
china
and
russia
are
truly
united
with
britain
and
america
in
recognition
of
this
essential
fact
the
best
interests
of
each
nation
large
and
small
demand
that
all
freedomloving
nations
shall
join
together
in
a
just
and
durable
system
of
peace
in
the
present
world
situation
evidenced
by
the
actions
of
germany
italy
and
japan
unquestioned
military
control
over
disturbers
of
the
peace
is
as
necessary
among
nations
as
it
is
among
citizens
in
a
community
and
an
equally
basic
essential
to
peace
is
a
decent
standard
of
living
for
all
individual
men
and
women
and
children
in
all
nations
freedom
from
fear
is
eternally
linked
with
freedom
from
want
there
are
people
who
burrow
through
our
nation
like
unseeing
moles
and
attempt
to
spread
the
suspicion
that
if
other
nations
are
encouraged
to
raise
their
standards
of
living
our
own
american
standard
of
living
must
of
necessity
be
depressed
the
fact
is
the
very
contrary
it
has
been
shown
time
and
again
that
if
the
standard
of
living
of
any
country
goes
up
so
does
its
purchasing
power
and
that
such
a
rise
encourages
a
better
standard
of
living
in
neighboring
countries
with
whom
it
trades
that
is
just
plain
common
senseand
it
is
the
kind
of
plain
common
sense
that
provided
the
basis
for
our
discussions
at
moscow
cairo
and
teheran
returning
from
my
journeyings
i
must
confess
to
a
sense
of
letdown
when
i
found
many
evidences
of
faulty
perspective
here
in
washington
the
faulty
perspective
consists
in
overemphasizing
lesser
problems
and
thereby
underemphasizing
the
first
and
greatest
problem
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
people
have
met
the
demands
of
this
war
with
magnificent
courage
and
understanding
they
have
accepted
inconveniences
they
have
accepted
hardships
they
have
accepted
tragic
sacrifices
and
they
are
ready
and
eager
to
make
whatever
further
contributions
are
needed
to
win
the
war
as
quickly
as
possibleif
only
they
are
given
the
chance
to
know
what
is
required
of
them
however
while
the
majority
goes
on
about
its
great
work
without
complaint
a
noisy
minority
maintains
an
uproar
of
demands
for
special
favors
for
special
groups
there
are
pests
who
swarm
through
the
lobbies
of
the
congress
and
the
cocktail
bars
of
washington
representing
these
special
groups
as
opposed
to
the
basic
interests
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
they
have
come
to
look
upon
the
war
primarily
as
a
chance
to
make
profits
for
themselves
at
the
expense
of
their
neighborsprofits
in
money
or
in
terms
of
political
or
social
preferment
such
selfish
agitation
can
be
highly
dangerous
in
wartime
it
creates
confusion
it
damages
morale
it
hampers
our
national
effort
it
muddies
the
waters
and
therefore
prolongs
the
war
if
we
analyze
american
history
impartially
we
cannot
escape
the
fact
that
in
our
past
we
have
not
always
forgotten
individual
and
selfish
and
partisan
interests
in
time
of
warwe
have
not
always
been
united
in
purpose
and
direction
we
cannot
overlook
the
serious
dissensions
and
the
lack
of
unity
in
our
war
of
the
revolution
in
our
war
of
or
in
our
war
between
the
states
when
the
survival
of
the
union
itself
was
at
stake
in
the
first
world
war
we
came
closer
to
national
unity
than
in
any
previous
war
but
that
war
lasted
only
a
year
and
a
half
and
increasing
signs
of
disunity
began
to
appear
during
the
final
months
of
the
conflict
in
this
war
we
have
been
compelled
to
learn
how
interdependent
upon
each
other
are
all
groups
and
sections
of
the
population
of
america
increased
food
costs
for
example
will
bring
new
demands
for
wage
increases
from
all
war
workers
which
will
in
turn
raise
all
prices
of
all
things
including
those
things
which
the
farmers
themselves
have
to
buy
increased
wages
or
prices
will
each
in
turn
produce
the
same
results
they
all
have
a
particularly
disastrous
result
on
all
fixed
income
groups
and
i
hope
you
will
remember
that
all
of
us
in
this
government
represent
the
fixed
income
group
just
as
much
as
we
represent
business
owners
workers
and
farmers
this
group
of
fixed
income
people
includes
teachers
clergy
policemen
firemen
widows
and
minors
on
fixed
incomes
wives
and
dependents
of
our
soldiers
and
sailors
and
oldage
pensioners
they
and
their
families
add
up
to
onequarter
of
our
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
people
they
have
few
or
no
high
pressure
representatives
at
the
capitol
in
a
period
of
gross
inflation
they
would
be
the
worst
sufferers
if
ever
there
was
a
time
to
subordinate
individual
or
group
selfishness
to
the
national
good
that
time
is
now
disunity
at
homebickerings
selfseeking
partisanship
stoppages
of
work
inflation
business
as
usual
politics
as
usual
luxury
as
usual
these
are
the
influences
which
can
undermine
the
morale
of
the
brave
men
ready
to
die
at
the
front
for
us
here
those
who
are
doing
most
of
the
complaining
are
not
deliberately
striving
to
sabotage
the
national
war
effort
they
are
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
time
is
past
when
we
must
make
prodigious
sacrificesthat
the
war
is
already
won
and
we
can
begin
to
slacken
off
but
the
dangerous
folly
of
that
point
of
view
can
be
measured
by
the
distance
that
separates
our
troops
from
their
ultimate
objectives
in
berlin
and
tokyoand
by
the
sum
of
all
the
perils
that
lie
along
the
way
overconfidence
and
complacency
are
among
our
deadliest
enemies
last
springafter
notable
victories
at
stalingrad
and
in
tunisia
and
against
the
uboats
on
the
high
seasoverconfidence
became
so
pronounced
that
war
production
fell
off
in
two
months
june
and
july
more
than
a
thousand
airplanes
that
could
have
been
made
and
should
have
been
made
were
not
made
those
who
failed
to
make
them
were
not
on
strike
they
were
merely
saying
the
wars
in
the
bagso
lets
relax
that
attitude
on
the
part
of
anyonegovernment
or
management
or
laborcan
lengthen
this
war
it
can
kill
american
boys
let
us
remember
the
lessons
of
in
the
summer
of
that
year
the
tide
turned
in
favor
of
the
allies
but
this
government
did
not
relax
in
fact
our
national
effort
was
stepped
up
in
august
the
draft
age
limits
were
broadened
from
to
the
president
called
for
force
to
the
utmost
and
his
call
was
heeded
and
in
november
only
three
months
later
germany
surrendered
that
is
the
way
to
fight
and
win
a
warall
outand
not
with
halfaneye
on
the
battlefronts
abroad
and
the
other
eyeandahalf
on
personal
selfish
or
political
interests
here
at
home
therefore
in
order
to
concentrate
all
our
energies
and
resources
on
winning
the
war
and
to
maintain
a
fair
and
stable
economy
at
home
i
recommend
that
the
congress
adopt
a
realistic
tax
lawwhich
will
tax
all
unreasonable
profits
both
individual
and
corporate
and
reduce
the
ultimate
cost
of
the
war
to
our
sons
and
daughters
the
tax
bill
now
under
consideration
by
the
congress
does
not
begin
to
meet
this
test
a
continuation
of
the
law
for
the
renegotiation
o
f
war
contractswhich
will
prevent
exorbitant
profits
and
assure
fair
prices
to
the
government
for
two
long
years
i
have
pleaded
with
the
congress
to
take
undue
profits
out
of
war
a
cost
of
food
lawwhich
will
enable
the
government
a
to
place
a
reasonable
floor
under
the
prices
the
farmer
may
expect
for
his
production
and
b
to
place
a
ceiling
on
the
prices
a
consumer
will
have
to
pay
for
the
food
he
buys
this
should
apply
to
necessities
only
and
will
require
public
funds
to
carry
out
it
will
cost
in
appropriations
about
one
percent
of
the
present
annual
cost
of
the
war
early
reenactment
of
the
stabilization
statute
of
october
this
expires
june
and
if
it
is
not
extended
well
in
advance
the
country
might
just
as
well
expect
price
chaos
by
summer
we
cannot
have
stabilization
by
wishful
thinking
we
must
take
positive
action
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
american
dollar
a
national
service
lawwhich
for
the
duration
of
the
war
will
prevent
strikes
and
with
certain
appropriate
exceptions
will
make
available
for
war
production
or
for
any
other
essential
services
every
ablebodied
adult
in
this
nation
these
five
measures
together
form
a
just
and
equitable
whole
i
would
not
recommend
a
national
service
law
unless
the
other
laws
were
passed
to
keep
down
the
cost
of
living
to
share
equitably
the
burdens
of
taxation
to
hold
the
stabilization
line
and
to
prevent
undue
profits
the
federal
government
already
has
the
basic
power
to
draft
capital
and
property
of
all
kinds
for
war
purposes
on
a
basis
of
just
compensation
as
you
know
i
have
for
three
years
hesitated
to
recommend
a
national
service
act
today
however
i
am
convinced
of
its
necessity
although
i
believe
that
we
and
our
allies
can
win
the
war
without
such
a
measure
i
am
certain
that
nothing
less
than
total
mobilization
of
all
our
resources
of
manpower
and
capital
will
guarantee
an
earlier
victory
and
reduce
the
toll
of
suffering
and
sorrow
and
blood
i
have
received
a
joint
recommendation
for
this
law
from
the
heads
of
the
war
department
the
navy
department
and
the
maritime
commission
these
are
the
men
who
bear
responsibility
for
the
procurement
of
the
necessary
arms
and
equipment
and
for
the
successful
prosecution
of
the
war
in
the
field
they
say
when
the
very
life
of
the
nation
is
in
peril
the
responsibility
for
service
is
common
to
all
men
and
women
in
such
a
time
there
can
be
no
discrimination
between
the
men
and
women
who
are
assigned
by
the
government
to
its
defense
at
the
battlefront
and
the
men
and
women
assigned
to
producing
the
vital
materials
essential
to
successful
military
operations
a
prompt
enactment
of
a
national
service
law
would
be
merely
an
expression
of
the
universality
of
this
responsibility
i
believe
the
country
will
agree
that
those
statements
are
the
solemn
truth
national
service
is
the
most
democratic
way
to
wage
a
war
like
selective
service
for
the
armed
forces
it
rests
on
the
obligation
of
each
citizen
to
serve
his
nation
to
his
utmost
where
he
is
best
qualified
it
does
not
mean
reduction
in
wages
it
does
not
mean
loss
of
retirement
and
seniority
rights
and
benefits
it
does
not
mean
that
any
substantial
numbers
of
war
workers
will
be
disturbed
in
their
present
jobs
let
these
facts
be
wholly
clear
experience
in
other
democratic
nations
at
warbritain
canada
australia
and
new
zealandhas
shown
that
the
very
existence
of
national
service
makes
unnecessary
the
widespread
use
of
compulsory
power
national
service
has
proven
to
be
a
unifying
moral
force
based
on
an
equal
and
comprehensive
legal
obligation
of
all
people
in
a
nation
at
war
there
are
millions
of
american
men
and
women
who
are
not
in
this
war
at
all
it
is
not
because
they
do
not
want
to
be
in
it
but
they
want
to
know
where
they
can
best
do
their
share
national
service
provides
that
direction
it
will
be
a
means
by
which
every
man
and
woman
can
find
that
inner
satisfaction
which
comes
from
making
the
fullest
possible
contribution
to
victory
i
know
that
all
civilian
war
workers
will
be
glad
to
be
able
to
say
many
years
hence
to
their
grandchildren
yes
i
too
was
in
service
in
the
great
war
i
was
on
duty
in
an
airplane
factory
and
i
helped
make
hundreds
of
fighting
planes
the
government
told
me
that
in
doing
that
i
was
performing
my
most
useful
work
in
the
service
of
my
country
it
is
argued
that
we
have
passed
the
stage
in
the
war
where
national
service
is
necessary
but
our
soldiers
and
sailors
know
that
this
is
not
true
we
are
going
forward
on
a
long
rough
roadand
in
all
journeys
the
last
miles
are
the
hardest
and
it
is
for
that
final
effortfor
the
total
defeat
of
our
enemiesthat
we
must
mobilize
our
total
resources
the
national
war
program
calls
for
the
employment
of
more
people
in
than
in
it
is
my
conviction
that
the
american
people
will
welcome
this
winthewar
measure
which
is
based
on
the
eternally
just
principle
of
fair
for
one
fair
for
all
it
will
give
our
people
at
home
the
assurance
that
they
are
standing
foursquare
behind
our
soldiers
and
sailors
and
it
will
give
our
enemies
demoralizing
assurance
that
we
mean
businessthat
we
americans
are
on
the
march
to
rome
berlin
and
tokyo
i
hope
that
the
congress
will
recognize
that
although
this
is
a
political
year
national
service
is
an
issue
which
transcends
politics
great
power
must
be
used
for
great
purposes
as
to
the
machinery
for
this
measure
the
congress
itself
should
determine
its
naturebut
it
should
be
wholly
nonpartisan
in
its
makeup
our
armed
forces
are
valiantly
fulfilling
their
responsibilities
to
our
country
and
our
people
now
the
congress
faces
the
responsibility
for
taking
those
measures
which
are
essential
to
national
security
in
this
the
most
decisive
phase
of
the
nations
greatest
war
several
alleged
reasons
have
prevented
the
enactment
of
legislation
which
would
preserve
for
our
soldiers
and
sailors
and
marines
the
fundamental
prerogative
of
citizenshipthe
right
to
vote
no
amount
of
legalistic
argument
can
becloud
this
issue
in
the
eyes
of
these
ten
million
american
citizens
surely
the
signers
of
the
constitution
did
not
intend
a
document
which
even
in
wartime
would
be
construed
to
take
away
the
franchise
of
any
of
those
who
are
fighting
to
preserve
the
constitution
itself
our
soldiers
and
sailors
and
marines
know
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
will
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
vote
if
the
voting
machinery
is
left
exclusively
to
the
states
under
existing
state
lawsand
that
there
is
no
likelihood
of
these
laws
being
changed
in
time
to
enable
them
to
vote
at
the
next
election
the
army
and
navy
have
reported
that
it
will
be
impossible
effectively
to
administer
fortyeight
different
soldier
voting
laws
it
is
the
duty
of
the
congress
to
remove
this
unjustifiable
discrimination
against
the
men
and
women
in
our
armed
forcesand
to
do
it
as
quickly
as
possible
it
is
our
duty
now
to
begin
to
lay
the
plans
and
determine
the
strategy
for
the
winning
of
a
lasting
peace
and
the
establishment
of
an
american
standard
of
living
higher
than
ever
before
known
we
cannot
be
content
no
matter
how
high
that
general
standard
of
living
may
be
if
some
fraction
of
our
peoplewhether
it
be
onethird
or
onefifth
or
onetenthis
illfed
illclothed
ill
housed
and
insecure
this
republic
had
its
beginning
and
grew
to
its
present
strength
under
the
protection
of
certain
inalienable
political
rightsamong
them
the
right
of
free
speech
free
press
free
worship
trial
by
jury
freedom
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
they
were
our
rights
to
life
and
liberty
as
our
nation
has
grown
in
size
and
stature
howeveras
our
industrial
economy
expandedthese
political
rights
proved
inadequate
to
assure
us
equality
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
we
have
come
to
a
clear
realization
of
the
fact
that
true
individual
freedom
cannot
exist
without
economic
security
and
independence
necessitous
men
are
not
free
men
people
who
are
hungry
and
out
of
a
job
are
the
stuff
of
which
dictatorships
are
made
in
our
day
these
economic
truths
have
become
accepted
as
selfevident
we
have
accepted
so
to
speak
a
second
bill
of
rights
under
which
a
new
basis
of
security
and
prosperity
can
be
established
for
all
regardless
of
station
race
or
creed
among
these
are
the
right
to
a
useful
and
remunerative
job
in
the
industries
or
shops
or
farms
or
mines
of
the
nation
the
right
to
earn
enough
to
provide
adequate
food
and
clothing
and
recreation
the
right
of
every
farmer
to
raise
and
sell
his
products
at
a
return
which
will
give
him
and
his
family
a
decent
living
the
right
of
every
businessman
large
and
small
to
trade
in
an
atmosphere
of
freedom
from
unfair
competition
and
domination
by
monopolies
at
home
or
abroad
the
right
of
every
family
to
a
decent
home
the
right
to
adequate
medical
care
and
the
opportunity
to
achieve
and
enjoy
good
health
the
right
to
adequate
protection
from
the
economic
fears
of
old
age
sickness
accident
and
unemployment
the
right
to
a
good
education
all
of
these
rights
spell
security
and
after
this
war
is
won
we
must
be
prepared
to
move
forward
in
the
implementation
of
these
rights
to
new
goals
of
human
happiness
and
wellbeing
americas
own
rightful
place
in
the
world
depends
in
large
part
upon
how
fully
these
and
similar
rights
have
been
carried
into
practice
for
our
citizens
for
unless
there
is
security
here
at
home
there
cannot
be
lasting
peace

all

share
his
concern
indeed
if
such

should
developif
history
were
to
repeat
itself
and
we
were
to
return
to
the
socalled
normalcy
of
the
sthen
it
is
certain
that
even
though

shall
have
conquered
our
enemies
on
the
battlefields
abroad
we
shall
have
yielded
to
the
spirit
of

here
at

i
ask
the
congress
to
explore
the
means
for
implementing
this
economic
bill
of
rightsfor
it
is
definitely
the
responsibility
of
the

so
to
do
many
of
these
problems
are
already
before
committees
o
f
the
congress
in
the
form

i
shall
from

to

communicate
with
the
congress
with
respect
to
these
and
further
proposals
in
the
event
that
no
adequate
program
of
progress
is
evolved
i
am
certain
that
the
nation
will
be
conscious
of
the
fact
our
fighting
men
abroadand
their
families
at
homeexpect
such
a
program
and
have
the
right
to
insist
upon
it
it
is
to
their
demands
that
this
government
should
pay
heed
rather
than
to
the
whining
demands
of
selfish
pressure
groups
who
seek
to
feather
their
nests

young
americans
are
dying
the
foreign
policy
that
we
have
been
followingthe
policy
that
guided
us
at
moscow
cairo
and
teheranis
based
on
the
common
sense
principle
which
was
best
expressed
by
benjamin
franklin
on
july
we
must
all
hang
together
or
assuredly
we
shall
all
hang
separately
i
have
often
said
that
there
are
no
two
fronts
for
america
in
this
war
there
is
only
one
front
there
is
one
line
of
unity
which
extends
from
the
hearts
of
the
people
at
home
to
the
men
of
our
attacking
forces
in
our
farthest
outposts
when
we
speak

total

we
speak
of

as
well

speak
of

of
the
great
moments
in
the
history
of

the
past

was
perhaps
the
most
crucial
for

violent

they
have

these
qualities
in

as
well
as
in

as

as

by
far
the
largest
and
most
important
developments
in
the
whole
worldwide
strategic
picture
of
were
the
events
of
the
long
fronts
in
russia
first
the
implacable
defense
of
stalingrad
and
second
the
offensives
by
the
russian
armies
at
various
points
that
started
in
the
latter
part
of
november
and
which
still
roll
on
with
great
force
and
effectiveness
the
other
major
events
of
the
year
were
the
series
of
japanese
advances
in
the
philippines
the
east
indies
malaya
and
burma
the
stopping
of
that
japanese
advance
in
the
midpacific
the
south
pacific
and
the
indian
oceans
the
successful
defense
of
the
near
east
by
the
british
counterattack
through
egypt
and
libya
the
americanbritish
occupation
of
north
africa
of
continuing
importance
in
the
year
were
the
unending
and
bitterly
contested
battles
of
the
convoy
routes
and
the
gradual
passing
of
air
superiority
from
the
axis
to
the
united
nations
the
axis
powers
knew
that
they
must
win
the
war
in
or
eventually
lose
everything
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
that
our
enemies
did
not
win
the
war
in
in
the
pacific
area
our
most
important
victory
in
was
the
air
and
naval
battle
off
midway
island
that
action
is
historically
important
because
it
secured
for
our
use
communication
lines
stretching
thousands
of
miles
in
every
direction
in
placing
this
emphasis
on
the
battle
of
midway
i
am
not
unmindful
of
other
successful
actions
in
the
pacific
in
the
air
and
on
land
and
afloatespecially
those
on
the
coral
sea
and
new
guinea
and
in
the
solomon
islands
but
these
actions
were
essentially
defensive
they
were
part
of
the
delaying
strategy
that
characterized
this
phase
of
the
war
during
this
period
we
inflicted
steady
losses
upon
the
enemygreat
losses
of
japanese
planes
and
naval
vessels
transports
and
cargo
ships
as
early
as
one
year
ago
we
set
as
a
primary
task
in
the
war
of
the
pacific
a
daybyday
and
weekbyweek
and
monthbymonth
destruction
of
more
japanese
war
materials
than
japanese
industry
could
replace
most
certainly
that
task
has
been
and
is
being
performed
by
our
fighting
ships
and
planes
and
a
large
part
of
this
task
has
been
accomplished
by
the
gallant
crews
of
our
american
submarines
who
strike
on
the
other
side
of
the
pacific
at
japanese
shipsright
up
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
harbor
of
yokohama
we
know
that
as
each
day
goes
by
japanese
strength
in
ships
and
planes
is
going
down
and
down
and
american
strength
in
ships
and
planes
is
going
up
and
up
and
so
i
sometimes
feel
that
the
eventual
outcome
can
now
be
put
on
a
mathematical
basis
that
will
become
evident
to
the
japanese
people
themselves
when
we
strike
at
their
own
home
islands
and
bomb
them
constantly
from
the
air
and
in
the
attacks
against
japan
we
shall
be
joined
with
the
heroic
people
of
chinathat
great
people
whose
ideals
of
peace
are
so
closely
akin
to
our
own
even
today
we
are
flying
as
much
lendlease
material
into
china
as
ever
traversed
the
burma
road
flying
it
over
mountains
feet
high
flying
blind
through
sleet
and
snow
we
shall
overcome
all
the
formidable
obstacles
and
get
the
battle
equipment
into
china
to
shatter
the
power
of
our
common
enemy
from
this
war
china
will
realize
the
security
the
prosperity
and
the
dignity
which
japan
has
sought
so
ruthlessly
to
destroy
the
period
of
our
defensive
attrition
in
the
pacific
is
drawing
to
a
close
now
our
aim
is
to
force
the
japanese
to
fight
last
year
we
stopped
them
this
year
we
intend
to
advance
turning
now
to
the
european
theater
of
war
during
this
past
year
it
was
clear
that
our
first
task
was
to
lessen
the
concentrated
pressure
on
the
russian
front
by
compelling
germany
to
divert
part
of
her
manpower
and
equipment
to
another
theater
of
war
after
months
of
secret
planning
and
preparation
in
the
utmost
detail
an
enormous
amphibious
expedition
was
embarked
for
french
north
africa
from
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
in
literally
hundreds
of
ships
it
reached
its
objectives
with
very
small
losses
and
has
already
produced
an
important
effect
upon
the
whole
situation
of
the
war
it
has
opened
to
attack
what
mr
churchill
well
described
as
the
underbelly
of
the
axis
and
it
has
removed
the
always
dangerous
threat
of
an
axis
attack
through
west
africa
against
the
south
atlantic
ocean
and
the
continent
of
south
america
itself
the
welltimed
and
splendidly
executed
offensive
from
egypt
by
the
british
eighth
army
was
a
part
of
the
same
major
strategy
of
the
united
nations
great
rains
and
appalling
mud
and
very
limited
communications
have
delayed
the
final
battles
of
tunisia
the
axis
is
reinforcing
its
strong
positions
but
i
am
confident
that
though
the
fighting
will
be
tough
when
the
final
allied
assault
is
made
the
last
vestige
of
axis
power
will
be
driven
from
the
whole
of
the
south
shores
of
the
mediterranean
any
review
of
the
year
must
emphasize
the
magnitude
and
the
diversity
of
the
military
activities
in
which
this
nation
has
become
engaged
as
i
speak
to
you
approximately
one
and
a
half
million
of
our
soldiers
sailors
marines
and
fliers
are
in
service
outside
of
our
continental
limits
all
through
the
world
our
merchant
seamen
in
addition
are
carrying
supplies
to
them
and
to
our
allies
over
every
sea
lane
few
americans
realize
the
amazing
growth
of
our
air
strength
though
i
am
sure
our
enemy
does
day
in
and
day
out
our
forces
are
bombing
the
enemy
and
meeting
him
in
combat
on
many
different
fronts
in
every
part
of
the
world
and
for
those
who
question
the
quality
of
our
aircraft
and
the
ability
of
our
fliers
i
point
to
the
fact
that
in
africa
we
are
shooting
down
two
enemy
planes
to
every
one
we
lose
and
in
the
pacific
and
the
southwest
pacific
we
are
shooting
them
down
four
to
one
we
pay
great
tributethe
tribute
of
the
united
states
of
americato
the
fighting
men
of
russia
and
china
and
britain
and
the
various
members
of
the
british
commonwealththe
millions
of
men
who
through
the
years
of
this
war
have
fought
our
common
enemies
and
have
denied
to
them
the
world
conquest
which
they
sought
we
pay
tribute
to
the
soldiers
and
fliers
and
seamen
of
others
of
the
united
nations
whose
countries
have
been
overrun
by
axis
hordes
as
a
result
of
the
allied
occupation
of
north
africa
powerful
units
of
the
french
army
and
navy
are
going
into
action
they
are
in
action
with
the
united
nations
forces
we
welcome
them
as
allies
and
as
friends
they
join
with
those
frenchmen
who
since
the
dark
days
of
june
have
been
fighting
valiantly
for
the
liberation
of
their
stricken
country
we
pay
tribute
to
the
fighting
leaders
of
our
allies
to
winston
churchill
to
joseph
stalin
and
to
the
generalissimo
chiang
kaishek
yes
there
is
a
very
great
unanimity
between
the
leaders
of
the
united
nations
this
unity
is
effective
in
planning
and
carrying
out
the
major
strategy
of
this
war
and
in
building
up
and
in
maintaining
the
lines
of
supplies
i
cannot
prophesy
i
cannot
tell
you
when
or
where
the
united
nations
are
going
to
strike
next
in
europe
but
we
are
going
to
strikeand
strike
hard
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
we
are
going
to
hit
them
in
norway
or
through
the
low
countries
or
in
france
or
through
sardinia
or
sicily
or
through
the
balkans
or
through
polandor
at
several
points
simultaneously
but
i
can
tell
you
that
no
matter
where
and
when
we
strike
by
land
we
and
the
british
and
the
russians
will
hit
them
from
the
air
heavily
and
relentlessly
day
in
and
day
out
we
shall
heap
tons
upon
tons
of
high
explosives
on
their
war
factories
and
utilities
and
seaports
hitler
and
mussolini
will
understand
now
the
enormity
of
their
miscalculationsthat
the
nazis
would
always
have
the
advantage
of
superior
air
power
as
they
did
when
they
bombed
warsaw
and
rotterdam
and
london
and
coventry
that
superiority
has
goneforever
yes
the
nazis
and
the
fascists
have
asked
for
itand
they
are
going
to
get
it
our
forward
progress
in
this
war
has
depended
upon
our
progress
on
the
production
front
there
has
been
criticism
of
the
management
and
conduct
of
our
war
production
much
of
this
selfcriticism
has
had
a
healthy
effect
it
has
spurred
us
on
it
has
reflected
a
normal
american
impatience
to
get
on
with
the
job
we
are
the
kind
of
people
who
are
never
quite
satisfied
with
anything
short
of
miracles
but
there
has
been
some
criticism
based
on
guesswork
and
even
on
malicious
falsification
of
fact
such
criticism
creates
doubts
and
creates
fears
and
weakens
our
total
effort
i
do
not
wish
to
suggest
that
we
should
be
completely
satisfied
with
our
production
progress
today
or
next
month
or
ever
but
i
can
report
to
you
with
genuine
pride
on
what
has
been
accomplished
in
a
year
ago
we
set
certain
production
goals
for
and
for
some
people
including
some
experts
thought
that
we
had
pulled
some
big
figures
out
of
a
hat
just
to
frighten
the
axis
but
we
had
confidence
in
the
ability
of
our
people
to
establish
new
records
and
that
confidence
has
been
justified
of
course
we
realized
that
some
production
objectives
would
have
to
be
changedsome
of
them
adjusted
upward
and
others
downward
some
items
would
be
taken
out
of
the
program
altogether
and
others
added
this
was
inevitable
as
we
gained
battle
experience
and
as
techn
ological
improvements
were
made
our
airplane
production
and
tank
production
fell
short
numericallystress
the
word
numerically
of
the
goals
set
a
year
ago
nevertheless
we
have
plenty
of
reason
to
be
proud
of
our
record
for
we
produced
military
planesmore
than
the
airplane
production
of
germany
italy
and
japan
put
together
last
month
in
december
we
produced
military
planes
and
the
rate
is
rapidly
rising
furthermore
we
must
remember
that
as
each
month
passes
by
the
averages
of
our
types
weigh
more
take
more
manhours
to
make
and
have
more
striking
power
in
tank
production
we
revised
our
scheduleand
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
as
a
result
of
hard
experience
in
battle
we
have
diverted
a
portion
of
our
tankproducing
capacity
to
a
steppedup
production
of
new
deadly
field
weapons
especially
selfpropelled
artillery
here
are
some
other
production
figures
in
we
produced
combat
vehicles
such
as
tanks
and
selfpropelled
artillery
in
we
produced
machine
guns
six
times
greater
than
our
production
in
and
three
times
greater
than
our
total
production
during
the
year
and
a
half
of
our
participation
in
the
first
world
war
we
produced
antitank
guns
six
times
greater
than
our
production
we
produced
ten
and
a
quarter
billion
rounds
of
smallarms
ammunition
five
times
greater
than
our
production
and
three
times
greater
than
our
total
production
in
the
first
world
war
we
produced
million
rounds
of
artillery
ammunition
twelve
times
greater
than
our
production
and
ten
times
greater
than
our
total
production
in
the
first
world
war
i
think
the
arsenal
of
democracy
is
making
good
these
facts
and
figures
that
i
have
given
will
give
no
great
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
on
the
contrary
i
can
imagine
that
they
will
give
him
considerable
discomfort
i
suspect
that
hitler
and
tojo
will
find
it
difficult
to
explain
to
the
german
and
japanese
people
just
why
it
is
that
decadent
inefficient
democracy
can
produce
such
phenomenal
quantities
of
weapons
and
munitionsand
fighting
men
we
have
given
the
lie
to
certain
misconceptionswhich
is
an
extremely
polite
wordespecially
the
one
which
holds
that
the
various
blocs
or
groups
within
a
free
country
cannot
forego
their
political
and
economic
differences
in
time
of
crisis
and
work
together
toward
a
common
goal
while
we
have
been
achieving
this
miracle
of
production
during
the
past
year
our
armed
forces
have
grown
from
a
little
over
to
in
other
words
we
have
withdrawn
from
the
labor
force
and
the
farms
some
of
our
younger
workers
and
in
spite
of
this
our
farmers
have
contributed
their
share
to
the
common
effort
by
producing
the
greatest
quantity
of
food
ever
made
available
during
a
single
year
in
all
our
history
i
wonder
is
there
any
person
among
us
so
simple
as
to
believe
that
all
this
could
have
been
done
without
creating
some
dislocations
in
our
normal
national
life
some
inconveniences
and
even
some
hardships
who
can
have
hoped
to
have
done
this
without
burdensome
government
regulations
which
are
a
nuisance
to
everyoneincluding
those
who
have
the
thankless
task
of
administering
them
we
all
know
that
there
have
been
mistakesmistakes
due
to
the
inevitable
process
of
trial
and
error
inherent
in
doing
big
things
for
the
first
time
we
all
know
that
there
have
been
too
many
complicated
forms
and
questionnaires
i
know
about
that
i
have
had
to
fill
some
of
them
out
myself
but
we
are
determined
to
see
to
it
that
our
supplies
of
food
and
other
essential
civilian
goods
are
distributed
on
a
fair
and
just
basisto
rich
and
poor
management
and
labor
farmer
and
city
dweller
alike
we
are
determined
to
keep
the
cost
of
living
at
a
stable
level
all
this
has
required
much
information
these
forms
and
questionnaires
represent
an
honest
and
sincere
attempt
by
honest
and
sincere
officials
to
obtain
this
information
we
have
learned
by
the
mistakes
that
we
have
made
our
experience
will
enable
us
during
the
coming
year
to
improve
the
necessary
mechanisms
of
wartime
economic
controls
and
to
simplify
administrative
procedures
but
we
do
not
intend
to
leave
things
so
lax
that
loopholes
will
be
left
for
cheaters
for
chiselers
or
for
the
manipulators
of
the
black
market
of
course
there
have
been
disturbances
and
inconveniencesand
even
hardships
and
there
will
be
many
many
more
before
we
finally
win
yes
will
not
be
an
easy
year
for
us
on
the
home
front
we
shall
feel
in
many
ways
in
our
daily
lives
the
sharp
pinch
of
total
war
fortunately
there
are
only
a
few
americans
who
place
appetite
above
patriotism
the
overwhelming
majority
realize
that
the
food
we
send
abroad
is
for
essential
military
purposes
for
our
own
and
allied
fighting
forces
and
for
necessary
help
in
areas
that
we
occupy
we
americans
intend
to
do
this
great
job
together
in
our
common
labors
we
must
build
and
fortify
the
very
foundation
of
national
unityconfidence
in
one
another
it
is
often
amusing
and
it
is
sometimes
politically
profitable
to
picture
the
city
of
washington
as
a
madhouse
with
the
congress
and
the
administration
disrupted
with
confusion
and
indecision
and
general
incompetence
howeverwhat
matters
most
in
war
is
results
and
the
one
pertinent
fact
is
that
after
only
a
few
years
of
preparation
and
only
one
year
of
warfare
we
are
able
to
engage
spiritually
as
well
as
physically
in
the
total
waging
of
a
total
war
washington
may
be
a
madhousebut
only
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
capital
city
of
a
nation
which
is
fighting
mad
and
i
think
that
berlin
and
rome
and
tokyo
which
had
such
contempt
for
the
obsolete
methods
of
democracy
would
now
gladly
use
all
they
could
get
of
that
same
brand
of
madness
and
we
must
not
forget
that
our
achievements
in
production
have
been
relatively
no
greater
than
those
of
the
russians
and
the
british
and
the
chinese
who
have
developed
their
own
war
industries
under
the
incredible
difficulties
of
battle
conditions
they
have
had
to
continue
work
through
bombings
and
blackouts
and
they
have
never
quit
we
americans
are
in
good
brave
company
in
this
war
and
we
are
playing
our
own
honorable
part
in
the
vast
common
effort
as
spokesmen
for
the
united
states
government
you
and
i
take
off
our
hats
to
those
responsible
for
our
american
productionto
the
owners
managers
and
supervisors
to
the
draftsmen
and
the
engineers
and
to
the
workers
men
and
womenin
factories
and
arsenals
and
shipyards
and
mines
and
mills
and
forestsand
railroads
and
on
highways
we
take
off
our
hats
to
the
farmers
who
have
faced
an
unprecedented
task
of
feeding
not
only
a
great
nation
but
a
great
part
of
the
world
we
take
off
our
hats
to
all
the
loyal
anonymous
untiring
men
and
women
who
have
worked
in
private
employment
and
in
government
and
who
have
endured
rationing
and
other
stringencies
with
good
humor
and
good
will
yes
we
take
off
our
hats
to
all
americans
who
have
contributed
so
magnificently
to
our
common
cause
i
have
sought
to
emphasize
a
sense
of
proportion
in
this
review
of
the
events
of
the
war
and
the
needs
of
the
war
we
should
never
forget
the
things
we
are
fighting
for
but
at
this
critical
period
of
the
war
we
should
confine
ourselves
to
the
larger
objectives
and
not
get
bogged
down
in
argument
over
methods
and
details
we
and
all
the
united
nations
want
a
decent
peace
and
a
durable
peace
in
the
years
between
the
end
of
the
first
world
war
and
the
beginning
of
the
second
world
war
we
were
not
living
under
a
decent
or
a
durable
peace
i
have
reason
to
know
that
our
boys
at
the
front
are
concerned
with
two
broad
aims
beyond
the
winning
of
the
war
and
their
thinking
and
their
opinion
coincide
with
what
most
americans
here
back
home
are
mulling
over
they
know
and
we
know
that
it
would
be
inconceivableit
would
indeed
be
sacrilegiousif
this
nation
and
the
world
did
not
attain
some
real
lasting
good
out
of
all
these
efforts
and
sufferings
and
bloodshed
and
death
the
men
in
our
armed
forces
want
a
lasting
peace
and
equally
they
want
permanent
employment
for
themselves
their
families
and
their
neighbors
when
they
are
mustered
out
at
the
end
of
the
war
two
years
ago
i
spoke
in
my
annual
message
of
four
freedoms
the
blessings
of
two
of
themfreedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religionare
an
essential
part
of
the
very
life
of
this
nation
and
we
hope
that
these
blessings
will
be
granted
to
all
men
everywhere
the
people
at
home
and
the
people
at
the
front
are
wondering
a
little
about
the
third
freedomfreedom
from
want
to
them
it
means
that
when
they
are
mustered
out
when
war
production
is
converted
to
the
economy
of
peace
they
will
have
the
right
to
expect
full
employmentfull
employment
for
themselves
and
for
all
ablebodied
men
and
women
in
america
who
want
to
work
they
expect
the
opportunity
to
work
to
run
their
farms
their
stores
to
earn
decent
wages
they
are
eager
to
face
the
risks
inherent
in
our
system
of
free
enterprise
they
do
not
want
a
postwar
america
which
suffers
from
undernourishment
or
slumsor
the
dole
they
want
no
getrichquick
era
of
bogus
prosperity
which
will
end
for
them
in
selling
apples
on
a
street
corner
as
happened
after
the
bursting
of
the
boom
in
when
you
talk
with
our
young
men
and
our
young
women
you
will
find
they
want
to
work
for
themselves
and
for
their
families
they
consider
that
they
have
the
right
to
work
and
they
know
that
after
the
last
war
their
fathers
did
not
gain
that
right
when
you
talk
with
our
young
men
and
women
you
will
find
that
with
the
opportunity
for
employment
they
want
assurance
against
the
evils
of
all
major
economic
hazardsassurance
that
will
extend
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
and
this
great
government
can
and
must
provide
this
assurance
i
have
been
told
that
this
is
no
time
to
speak
of
a
better
america
after
the
war
i
am
told
it
is
a
grave
error
on
my
part
i
dissent
and
if
the
security
of
the
individual
citizen
or
the
family
should
become
a
subject
of
national
debate
the
country
knows
where
i
stand
i
say
this
now
to
this
seventyeighth
congress
because
it
is
wholly
possible
that
freedom
from
wantthe
right
of
employment
the
right
of
assurance
against
lifes
hazardswill
loom
very
large
as
a
task
of
america
during
the
coming
two
years
i

trust
it
will
not
be
regarded
as
an
issuebut
rather
as
a
task
for
all
of
us
to
study
sympathetically
to
work
out
with
a
constant
regard
for
the
attainment
of
the
objective
with
fairness
to
all
and
with
injustice
to
none
in
this
war
of
survival
we
must
keep
before
our
minds
not
only
the
evil
things
we
fight
against
but
the
good
things
we
are
fighting
for
we
fight
to
retain
a
great
pastand
we
fight
to
gain
a
greater
future
let
us
remember
too
that
economic
safety
for
the
america
of
the
future
is
threatened
unless
a
greater
economic
stability
comes
to
the
rest
of
the
world
we
cannot
make
america
an
island
in
either
a
military
or
an
economic
sense
hitlerism
like
any
other
form
of
crime
or
disease
can
grow
from
the
evil
seeds
of
economic
as
well
as
military
feudalism
victory
in
this
war
is
the
first
and
greatest
goal
before
us
victory
in
the
peace
is
the
next
that
means
striving
toward
the
enlargement
of
the
security
of
man
here
and
throughout
the
worldand
finally
striving
for
the
fourth
freedomfreedom
from
fear
it
is
of
little
account
for
any
of
us
to
talk
of
essential
human
needs
of
attaining
security
if
we
run
the
risk
of
another
world
war
in
ten
or
twenty
or
fifty
years
that
is
just
plain
common
sense
wars
grow
in
size
in
death
and
destruction
and
in
the
inevitability
of
engulfing
all
nations
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
shrinking
size
of
the
world
as
a
result
of
the
conquest
of
the
air
i
shudder
to
think
of
what
will
happen
to
humanity
including
ourselves
if
this
war
ends
in
an
inconclusive
peace
and
another
war
breaks
out
when
the
babies
of
today
have
grown
to
fighting
age
every
normal
american
prays
that
neither
he
nor
his
sons
nor
his
grandsons
will
be
compelled
to
go
through
this
horror
again
undoubtedly
a
few
americans
even
now
think
that
this
nation
can
end
this
war
comfortably
and
then
climb
back
into
an
american
hole
and
pull
the
hole
in
after
them
but
we
have
learned
that
we
can
never
dig
a
hole
so
deep
that
it
would
be
safe
against
predatory
animals
we
have
also
learned
that
if
we
do
not
pull
the
fangs
of
the
predatory
animals
of
this
world
they
will
multiply
and
grow
in
strengthand
they
will
be
at
our
throats
again
once
more
in
a
short
generation
most
americans
realize
more
clearly
than
ever
before
that
modern
war
equipment
in
the
hands
of
aggressor
nations
can
bring
danger
overnight
to
our
own
national
existence
or
to
that
of
any
other
nationor
islandor
continent
it
is
clear
to
us
that
if
germany
and
italy
and
japanor
any
one
of
them
remain
armed
at
the
end
of
this
war
or
are
permitted
to
rearm
they
will
again
and
inevitably
embark
upon
an
ambitious
career
of
world
conquest
they
must
be
disarmed
and
kept
disarmed
and
they
must
abandon
the
philosophy
and
the
teaching
of
that
philosophy
which
has
brought
so
much
suffering
to
the
world
after
the
first
world
war
we
tried
to
achieve
a
formula
for
permanent
peace
based
on
a
magnificent
idealism
we
failed
but
by
our
failure
we
have
learned
that
we
cannot
maintain
peace
at
this
stage
of
human
development
by
good
intentions
alone
today
the
united
nations
are
the
mightiest
military
coalition
in
all
history
they
represent
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
population
of
the
world
bound
together
in
solemn
agreement
that
they
themselves
will
not
commit
acts
of
aggression
or
conquest
against
any
of
their
neighbors
the
united
nations
can
and
must
remain
united
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
by
preventing
any
attempt
to
rearm
in
germany
in
japan
in
italy
or
in
any
other
nation
which
seeks
to
violate
the
tenth
commandmentthou
shalt
not
covet
there
are
cynics
there
are
skeptics
who
say
it
cannot
be
done
the
american
people
and
all
the
freedomloving
peoples
of
this
earth
are
now
demanding
that
it
must
be
done
and
the
will
of
these
people
shall
prevail
the
very
philosophy
of
the
axis
powers
is
based
on
a
profound
contempt
for
the
human
race
if
in
the
formation
of
our
future
policy
we
were
guided
by
the
same
cynical
contempt
then
we
should
be
surrendering
to
the
philosophy
of
our
enemies
and
our
victory
would
turn
to
defeat
the
issue
of
this
war
is
the
basic
issue
between
those
who
believe
in
mankind
and
those
who
do
notthe
ancient
issue
between
those
who
put
their
faith
in
the
people
and
those
who
put
their
faith
in
dictators
and
tyrants
there
have
always
been
those
who
did
not
believe
in
the
people
who
attempted
to
block
their
forward
movement
across
history
to
force
them
back
to
servility
and
suffering
and
silence
the
people
have
now
gathered
their
strength
they
are
moving
forward
in
their
might
and
powerand
no
force
no
combination
of
forces
no
trickery
deceit
or
violence
can
stop
them
now
they
see
before
them
the
hope
of
the
worlda
decent
secure
peaceful
life
for
men
everywhere
i
do
not
prophesy
when
this
war
will
end
but
i
do
believe
that
this
year
of
will
give
to
the
united
nations
a
very
substantial
advance
along
the
roads
that
lead
to
berlin
and
rome
and
tokyo
i
tell
you
it
is
within
the
realm
of
possibility
that
this
seventyeighth
congress
may
have
the
historic
privilege
of
helping
greatly
to
save
the
world
from
future
fear
therefore
let
us
all
have
confidence
let
us
redouble
our
efforts
a
tremendous
costly
longenduring
task
in
peace
as
well
as
in
war
is
still
ahead
of
us
but
as
we
face
that
continuing
task
we
may
know
that
the
state
of
this
nation
is
goodthe
heart
of
this
nation
is
soundthe
spirit
of
this
nation
is
strongthe
faith
of
this
nation
is
eternal

in
fulfilling
my
duty
to
report
upon
the
state
of
the
union
i
am
proud
to
say
to
you
that
the
spirit
of
the
american
people
was
never
higher
than
it
is
todaythe
union
was
never
more
closely
knit
togetherthis
country
was
never
more
deeply
determined
to
face
the
solemn
tasks
before
it
the
response
of
the
american
people
has
been
instantaneous
and
it
will
be
sustained
until
our
security
is
assured
exactly
one
year
ago
today
i
said
to
this
congress
when
the
dictators
are
ready
to
make
war
upon
us
they
will
not
wait
for
an
act
of
war
on
our
part
theynot
wewill
choose
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
method
of
their
attack
we
now
know
their
choice
of
the
time
a
peaceful
sunday
morningdecember
we
know
their
choice
of
the
place
an
american
outpost
in
the
pacific
we
know
their
choice
of
the
method
the
method
of
hitler
himself
japans
scheme
of
conquest
goes
back
half
a
century
it
was
not
merely
a
policy
of
seeking
living
room
it
was
a
plan
which
included
the
subjugation
of
all
the
peoples
in
the
far
east
and
in
the
islands
of
the
pacific
and
the
domination
of
that
ocean
by
japanese
military
and
naval
control
of
the
western
coasts
of
north
central
and
south
america
the
development
of
this
ambitious
conspiracy
was
marked
by
the
war
against
china
in
the
subsequent
occupation
of
korea
the
war
against
russia
in
the
illegal
fortification
of
the
mandated
pacific
islands
following
the
seizure
of
manchuria
in
and
the
invasion
of
china
in
a
similar
policy
of
criminal
conquest
was
adopted
by
italy
the
fascists
first
revealed
their
imperial
designs
in
libya
and
tripoli
in
they
seized
abyssinia
their
goal
was
the
domination
of
all
north
africa
egypt
parts
of
france
and
the
entire
mediterranean
world
but
the
dreams
of
empire
of
the
japanese
and
fascist
leaders
were
modest
in
comparison
with
the
gargantuan
aspirations
of
hitler
and
his
nazis
even
before
they
came
to
power
in
their
plans
for
that
conquest
had
been
drawn
those
plans
provided
for
ultimate
domination
not
of
any
one
section
of
the
world
but
of
the
whole
earth
and
all
the
oceans
on
it
when
hitler
organized
his
berlinrometokyo
alliance
all
these
plans
of
conquest
became
a
single
plan
under
this
in
addition
to
her
own
schemes
of
conquest
japans
role
was
obviously
to
cut
off
our
supply
of
weapons
of
war
to
britain
and
russia
and
chinaweapons
which
increasingly
were
speeding
the
day
of
hitlers
doom
the
act
of
japan
at
pearl
harbor
was
intended
to
stun
usto
terrify
us
to
such
an
extent
that
we
would
divert
our
industrial
and
military
strength
to
the
pacific
area
or
even
to
our
own
continental
defense
the
plan
has
failed
in
its
purpose
we
have
not
been
stunned
we
have
not
been
terrified
or
confused
this
very
reassembling
of
the
seventyseventh
congress
today
is
proof
of
that
for
the
mood
of
quiet
grim
resolution
which
here
prevails
bodes
ill
for
those
who
conspired
and
collaborated
to
murder
world
peace
that
mood
is
stronger
than
any
mere
desire
for
revenge
it
expresses
the
will
of
the
american
people
to
make
very
certain
that
the
world
will
never
so
suffer
again
admittedly
we
have
been
faced
with
hard
choices
it
was
bitter
for
example
not
to
be
able
to
relieve
the
heroic
and
historic
defenders
of
wake
island
it
was
bitter
for
us
not
to
be
able
to
land
a
million
men
in
a
thousand
ships
in
the
philippine
islands
but
this
adds
only
to
our
determination
to
see
to
it
that
the
stars
and
stripes
will
fly
again
over
wake
and
guam
yes
see
to
it
that
the
brave
people
of
the
philippines
will
be
rid
of
japanese
imperialism
and
will
live
in
freedom
security
and
independence
powerful
and
offensive
actions
must
and
will
be
taken
in
proper
time
the
consolidation
of
the
united
nations
total
war
effort
against
our
common
enemies
is
being
achieved
that
was
and
is
the
purpose
of
conferences
which
have
been
held
during
the
past
two
weeks
in
washington
and
moscow
and
chungking
that
is
the
primary
objective
of
the
declaration
of
solidarity
signed
in
washington
on
january
by
nations
united
against
the
axis
powers
difficult
choices
may
have
to
be
made
in
the
months
to
come
we
do
not
shrink
from
such
decisions
we
and
those
united
with
us
will
make
those
decisions
with
courage
and
determination
plans
have
been
laid
here
and
in
the
other
capitals
for
coordinated
and
cooperative
action
by
all
the
united
nationsmilitary
action
and
economic
action
already
we
have
established
as
you
know
unified
command
of
land
sea
and
air
forces
in
the
southwestern
pacific
theater
of
war
there
will
be
a
continuation
of
conferences
and
consultations
among
military
staffs
so
that
the
plans
and
operations
of
each
will
fit
into
the
general
strategy
designed
to
crush
the
enemy
we
shall
not
fight
isolated
warseach
nation
going
its
own
way
these
nations
are
unitednot
in
spirit
and
determination
alone
but
in
the
broad
conduct
of
the
war
in
all
its
phases
for
the
first
time
since
the
japanese
and
the
fascists
and
the
nazis
started
along
their
bloodstained
course
of
conquest
they
now
face
the
fact
that
superior
forces
are
assembling
against
them
gone
forever
are
the
days
when
the
aggressors
could
attack
and
destroy
their
victims
one
by
one
without
unity
of
resistance
we
of
the
united
nations
will
so
dispose
our
forces
that
we
can
strike
at
the
common
enemy
wherever
the
greatest
damage
can
be
done
him
the
militarists
of
berlin
and
tokyo
started
this
war
but
the
massed
angered
forces
of
common
humanity
will
finish
it
destruction
of
the
material
and
spiritual
centers
of
civilizationthis
has
been
and
still
is
the
purpose
of
hitler
and
his
italian
and
japanese
chessmen
they
would
wreck
the
power
of
the
british
commonwealth
and
russia
and
china
and
the
netherlandsand
then
combine
all
their
forces
to
achieve
their
ultimate
goal
the
conquest
of
the
united
states
they
know
that
victory
for
us
means
victory
for
freedom
they
know
that
victory
for
us
means
victory
for
the
institution
of
democracythe
ideal
of
the
family
the
simple
principles
of
common
decency
and
humanity
they
know
that
victory
for
us
means
victory
for
religion
and
they
could
not
tolerate
that
the
world
is
too
small
to
provide
adequate
living
room
for
both
hitler
and
god
in
proof
of
that
the
nazis
have
now
announced
their
plan
for
enforcing
their
new
german
pagan
religion
all
over
the
worlda
plan
by
which
the
holy
bible
and
the
cross
of
mercy
would
be
displaced
by
mein
kampf
and
the
swastika
and
the
naked
sword
our
own
objectives
are
clear
the
objective
of
smashing
the
militarism
imposed
by
war
lords
upon
their
enslaved
peoples
the
objective
of
liberating
the
subjugated
nationsthe
objective
of
establishing
and
securing
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
religion
freedom
from
want
and
freedom
from
fear
everywhere
in
the
world
we
shall
not
stop
short
of
these
objectivesnor
shall
we
be
satisfied
merely
to
gain
them
and
then
call
it
a
day
i
know
that
i
speak
for
the
american
peopleand
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
i
speak
also
for
all
the
other
peoples
who
fight
with
uswhen
i
say
that
this
time
we
are
determined
not
only
to
win
the
war
but
also
to
maintain
the
security
of
the
peace
that
will
follow
but
we
know
that
modern
methods
of
warfare
make
it
a
task
not
only
of
shooting
and
fighting
but
an
even
more
urgent
one
of
working
and
producing
victory
requires
the
actual
weapons
of
war
and
the
means
of
transporting
them
to
a
dozen
points
of
combat
it
will
not
be
sufficient
for
us
and
the
other
united
nations
to
produce
a
slightly
superior
supply
of
munitions
to
that
of
germany
japan
italy
and
the
stolen
industries
in
the
countries
which
they
have
overrun
the
superiority
of
the
united
nations
in
munitions
and
ships
must
be
overwhelmingso
overwhelming
that
the
axis
nations
can
never
hope
to
catch
up
with
it
and
so
in
order
to
attain
this
overwhelming
superiority
the
united
states
must
build
planes
and
tanks
and
guns
and
ships
to
the
utmost
limit
of
our
national
capacity
we
have
the
ability
and
capacity
to
produce
arms
not
only
for
our
own
forces
but
also
for
the
armies
navies
and
air
forces
fighting
on
our
side
and
our
overwhelming
superiority
of
armament
must
be
adequate
to
put
weapons
of
war
at
the
proper
time
into
the
hands
of
those
men
in
the
conquered
nations
who
stand
ready
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
to
revolt
against
their
german
and
japanese
oppressors
and
against
the
traitors
in
their
own
ranks
known
by
the
already
infamous
name
of
quislings
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
fair
prophecy
to
say
that
as
we
get
guns
to
the
patriots
in
those
lands
they
too
will
fire
shots
heard
round
the
world
this
production
of
ours
in
the
united
states
must
be
raised
far
above
present
levels
even
though
it
will
mean
the
dislocation
of
the
lives
and
occupations
of
millions
of
our
own
people
we
must
raise
our
sights
all
along
the
production
line
let
no
man
say
it
cannot
be
done
it
must
be
doneand
we
have
undertaken
to
do
it
i
have
just
sent
a
letter
of
directive
to
the
appropriate
departments
and
agencies
of
our
government
ordering
that
immediate
steps
be
taken
first
to
increase
our
production
rate
of
airplanes
so
rapidly
that
in
this
year
we
shall
produce
planes
more
than
the
goal
that
we
set
a
year
and
a
half
ago
this
includes
combat
planesbombers
dive
bombers
pursuit
planes
the
rate
of
increase
will
be
maintained
and
continued
so
that
next
year
we
shall
produce
airplanes
including
combat
planes
second
to
increase
our
production
rate
of
tanks
so
rapidly
that
in
this
year
we
shall
produce
tanks
and
to
continue
that
increase
so
that
next
year
we
shall
produce
tanks
third
to
increase
our
production
rate
of
antiaircraft
guns
so
rapidly
that
in
this
year
we
shall
produce
of
them
and
to
continue
that
increase
so
that
next
year
we
shall
produce
antiaircraft
guns
and
fourth
to
increase
our
production
rate
of
merchant
ships
so
rapidly
that
in
this
year
we
shall
build
deadweight
tons
as
compared
with
a
completed
production
of
and
finally
we
shall
continue
that
increase
so
that
next
year
we
shall
build
tons
of
shipping
these
figures
and
similar
figures
for
a
multitude
of
other
implements
of
war
will
give
the
japanes
e
and
the
nazis
a
little
idea
of
just
what
they
accomplished
in
the
attack
at
pearl
harbor
and
i
rather
hope
that
all
these
figures
which
i
have
given
will
become
common
knowledge
in
germany
and
japan
our
task
is
hardour
task
is
unprecedentedand
the
time
is
short
we
must
strain
every
existing
armamentproducing
facility
to
the
utmost
we
must
convert
every
available
plant
and
tool
to
war
production
that
goes
all
the
way
from
the
greatest
plants
to
the
smallestfrom
the
huge
automobile
industry
to
the
village
machine
shop
production
for
war
is
based
on
men
and
womenthe
human
hands
and
brains
which
collectively
we
call
labor
our
workers
stand
ready
to
work
long
hours
to
turn
out
more
in
a
days
work
to
keep
the
wheels
turning
and
the
fires
burning
twentyfour
hours
a
day
and
seven
days
a
week
they
realize
well
that
on
the
speed
and
efficiency
of
their
work
depend
the
lives
of
their
sons
and
their
brothers
on
the
fighting

so
far
we
have
hardly
even
begun
to
pay
for
it
we
have
devoted
only

of
our
national

to
national
defense
as
will
appear
in
my
budget
message
tomorrow
our
war
program
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
will
cost
billion
dollars
or
in
other
words
more
than
half
of
the
estimated
annual
national

that
means

and

it
means

powerful
and
cunningand
cruel
and
ruthless
he
will
stop
at
nothing
that
gives
him
a
chance
to
kill
and
to
destroy
he
has
trained
his
people
to
believe
that
their
highest
perfection
is
achieved
by
waging
war
for
many
years
he
has
prepared
for
this
very
conflictplanning
and
plotting
and
training
arming
and
fighting
we
have
already
tasted
defeat
we
may
suffer
further
setbacks
we
must
face
the
fact
of
a
hard
war
a
long
war
a
bloody
war
a
costly
war
we
must
on
the
other
hand
guard
against
defeatism
that
has
been
one
of
the
chief
weapons
of
hitlers
propaganda
machineused
time
and
again
with
deadly
results
it
will
not
be
used
successfully
on
the
american
people
we
must
guard
against
divisions
among
ourselves
and
among
all
the
other
united
nations
we
must
be
particularly
vigilant
against
racial
discrimination
in
any
of
its
ugly
forms
hitler
will
try
again
to
breed
mistrust
and
suspicion
between
one
individual
and
another
one
group
and
another
one
race
and
another
one
government
and
another
he
will
try
to
use
the
same
technique
of
falsehood
and
rumormongering
with
which
he
divided
france
from
britain
he
is
trying
to
do
this
with
us
even
now
but
he
will
find
a
unity
of
will
and
purpose
against
him
which
will
persevere
until
the
destruction
of
all
his
black
designs
upon
the
freedom
and
safety
of
the
people
of
the
world
we
cannot
wage
this
war
in
a
defensive
spirit
as
our
power
and
our
resources
are
fully
mobilized
we
shall
carry
the
attack
against
the
enemywe
shall
hit
him
and
hit
him
again
wherever
and
whenever
we
can
reach
him
we
must
keep
him
far
from
our
shores
for
we
intend
to
bring
this
battle
to
him
on
his
own
home
grounds
american
armed
forces
must
be
used
at
any
place
in
all
the
world
where
it
seems
advisable
to
engage
the
forces
of
the
enemy
in
some
cases
these
operations
will
be
defensive
in
order
to
protect
key
positions
in
other
cases
these
operations
will
be
offensive
in
order
to
strike
at
the
common
enemy
with
a
view
to
his
complete
encirclement
and
eventual
total
defeat
american
armed
forces
will
operate
at
many
points
in
the
far
east
american
armed
forces
will
be
on
all
the
oceanshelping
to
guard
the
essential
communications
which
are
vital
to
the
united
nations
american
land
and
air
and
sea
forces
will
take
stations
in
the
british
isleswhich
constitute
an
essential
fortress
in
this
great
world
struggle
american
armed
forces
will
help
to
protect
this
hemisphereand
also
help
to
protect
bases
outside
this
hemisphere
which
could
be
used
for
an
attack
on
the
americas
if
any
of
our
enemies
from
europe
or
from
asia
attempt
longrange
raids
by
suicide
squadrons
of
bombing
planes
they
will
do
so
only
in
the
hope
of
terrorizing
our
people
and
disrupting
our
morale
our
people
are
not
afraid
of
that
we
know
that
we
may
have
to
pay
a
heavy
price
for
freedom
we
will
pay
this
price
with
a
will
whatever
the
price
it
is
a
thousand
times
worth
it
no
matter
what
our
enemies
in
their
desperation
may
attempt
to
do
to
uswe
will
say
as
the
people
of
london
have
said
we
can
take
it
and
whats
more
we
can
give
it
back
and
we
will
give
it
backwith
compound
interest
when
our
enemies
challenged
our
country
to
stand
up
and
fight
they
challenged
each
and
every
one
of
us
and
each
and
every
one
of
us
has
accepted
the
challengefor
himself
and
for
his
nation
there
were
only
some
united
states
marines
who
in
the
heroic
and
historic
defense
of
wake
island
inflicted
such
great
losses
on
the
enemy
some
of
those
men
were
killed
in
action
and
others
are
now
prisoners
of
war
when
the
survivors
of
that
great
fight
are
liberated
and
restored
to
their
homes
they
will
learn
that
a
hundred
and
thirty
million
of
their
fellow
citizens
have
been
inspired
to
render
their
own
full
share
of
service
and
sacrifice
we
can
well
say
that
our
men
on
the
fighting
fronts
have
already
proved
that
americans
today
are
just
as
rugged
and
just
as
tough
as
any
of
the
heroes
whose
exploits
we
celebrate
on
the
fourth
of
july
many
people
ask
when
will
this
war
end
there
is
only
one
answer
to
that
it
will
end
just
as
soon
as
we
make
it
end
by
our
combined
efforts
our
combined
strength
our
combined
determination
to
fight
through
and
work
through
until
the
endthe
end
of
militarism
in
germany
and
italy
and
japan
most
certainly
we
shall
not
settle
for
less
that
is
the
spirit
in
which
discussions
have
been
conducted
during
the
visit
of
the
british
prime
minister
to
washington
mr
churchill
and
i
understand
each
other
our
motives
and
our
purposes
together
during
the
past
two
weeks
we
have
faced
squarely
the
major
military
and
economic
problems
of
this
greatest
world
war
all
in
our
nation
have
been
cheered
by
mr
churchills
visit
we
have
been
deeply
stirred
by
his
great
message
to
us
he
is
welcome
in
our
midst
and
we
unite
in
wishing
him
a
safe
return
to
his
home
for
we
are
fighting
on
the
same
side
with
the
british
people
who
fought
alone
for
long
terrible
months
and
withstood
the
enemy
with
fortitude
and
tenacity
and
skill
we
are
fighting
on
the
same
side
with
the
russian
people
who
have
seen
the
nazi
hordes
swarm
up
to
the
very
gates
of
moscow
and
who
with
almost
superhuman
will
and
courage
have
forced
the
invaders
back
into
retreat
we
are
fighting
on
the
same
side
as
the
brave
people
of
chinathose
millions
who
for
four
and
a
half
long
years
have
withstood
bombs
and
starvation
and
have
whipped
the
invaders
time
and
again
in
spite
of
the
superior
japanese
equipment
and
arms
yes
we
are
fighting
on
the
same
side
as
the
indomitable
dutch
we
are
fighting
on
the
same
side
as
all
the
other
governments
in
exile
whom
hitler
and
all
his
armies
and
all
his
gestapo
have
not
been
able
to
conquer
but
we
of
the
united
nations
are
not
making
all
this
sacrifice
of
human
effort
and
human
lives
to
return
to
the
kind
of
world
we
had
after
the
last
world
war
we
are
fighting
today
for
security
for
progress
and
for
peace
not
only
for
ourselves
but
for
all
men
not
only
for
one
generation
but
for
all
generations
we
are
fighting
to
cleanse
the
world
of
ancient
evils
ancient
ills
our
enemies
are
guided
by
brutal
cynicism
by
unholy
contempt
for
the
human
race
we
are
inspired
by
a
faith
that
goes
back
through
all
the
years
to
the
first
chapter
of
the
book
of
genesis
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
we
on
our
side
are
striving
to
be
true
to
that
divine
heritage
we
are
fighting
as
our
fathers
have
fought
to
uphold
the
doctrine
that
all
men
are
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
those
on
the
other
side
are
striving
to
destroy
this
deep
belief
and
to
create
a
world
in
their
own
imagea
world
of
tyranny
and
cruelty
and
serfdom
that
is
the
conflict
that
day
and
night
now
pervades
our
lives
no
compromise
can
end
that
conflict
there
never
has
beenthere
never
can
besuccessful
compromise
between
good
and
evil
only
total
victory
can
reward
the
champions
of
tolerance
and
decency
and

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
seventyseventh
congress
i
address
you
the
members
of
the
seventyseventh
congress
at
a
moment
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
union
i
use
the
word
unprecedented
because
at
no
previous
time
has
american
security
been
as
seriously
threatened
from
without
as
it
is
today
since
the
permanent
formation
of
our
government
under
the
constitution
in
most
of
the
periods
of
crisis
in
our
history
have
related
to
our
domestic
affairs
fortunately
only
one
of
thesethe
fouryear
war
between
the
statesever
threatened
our
national
unity
today
thank
god
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
americans
in
fortyeight
states
have
forgotten
points
of
the
compass
in
our
national
unity
it
is
true
that
prior
to
the
united
states
often
had
been
disturbed
by
events
in
other
continents
we
had
even
engaged
in
two
wars
with
european
nations
and
in
a
number
of
undeclared
wars
in
the
west
indies
in
the
mediterranean
and
in
the
pacific
for
the
maintenance
of
american
rights
and
for
the
principles
of
peaceful
commerce
but
in
no
case
had
a
serious
threat
been
raised
against
our
national
safety
or
our
continued
independence
what
i
seek
to
convey
is
the
historic
truth
that
the
united
states
as
a
nation
has
at
all
times
maintained
clear
definite
opposition
to
any
attempt
to
lock
us
in
behind
an
ancient
chinese
wall
while
the
procession
of
civilization
went
past
today
thinking
of
our
children
and
of
their
children
we
oppose
enforced
isolation
for
ourselves
or
for
any
other
part
of
the
americas
that
determination
of
ours
extending
over
all
these
years
was
proved
for
example
during
the
quarter
century
of
wars
following
the
french
revolution
while
the
napoleonic
struggles
did
threaten
interests
of
the
united
states
because
of
the
french
foothold
in
the
west
indies
and
in
louisiana
and
while
we
engaged
in
the
war
of
to
vindicate
our
right
to
peaceful
trade
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
neither
france
nor
great
britain
nor
any
other
nation
was
aiming
at
domination
of
the
whole
world
in
like
fashion
from
to
ninetynine
yearsno
single
war
in
europe
or
in
asia
constituted
a
real
threat
against
our
future
or
against
the
future
of
any
other
american
nation
except
in
the
maximilian
interlude
in
mexico
no
foreign
power
sought
to
establish
itself
in
this
hemisphere
and
the
strength
of
the
british
fleet
in
the
atlantic
has
been
a
friendly
strength
it
is
still
a
friendly
strength
even
when
the
world
war
broke
out
in
it
seemed
to
contain
only
small
threat
of
danger
to
our
own
american
future
but
as
time
went
on
the
american
people
began
to
visualize
what
the
downfall
of
democratic
nations
might
mean
to
our
own
democracy
we
need
not
overemphasize
imperfections
in
the
peace
of
versailles
we
need
not
harp
on
failure
of
the
democracies
to
deal
with
problems
of
world
reconstruction
we
should
remember
that
the
peace
of
was
far
less
unjust
than
the
kind
of
pacification
which
began
even
before
munich
and
which
is
being
carried
on
under
the
new
order
of
tyranny
that
seeks
to
spread
over
every
continent
today
the
american
people
have
unalterably
set
their
faces
against
that
tyranny
every
realist
knows
that
the
democratic
way
of
life
is
at
this
moment
being
directly
assailed
in
every
part
of
the
worldassailed
either
by
arms
or
by
secret
spreading
of
poisonous
propaganda
by
those
who
seek
to
destroy
unity
and
promote
discord
in
nations
that
are
still
at
peace
during
sixteen
long
months
this
assault
has
blotted
out
the
whole
pattern
of
democratic
life
in
an
appalling
number
of
independent
nations
great
and
small
the
assailants
are
still
on
the
march
threatening
other
nations
great
and
small
therefore
as
your
president
performing
my
constitutional
duty
to
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
i
find
it
unhappily
necessary
to
report
that
the
future
and
the
safety
of
our
country
and
of
our
democracy
are
overwhelmingly
involved
in
events
far
beyond
our
borders
armed
defense
of
democratic
existence
is
now
being
gallantly
waged
in
four
continents
if
that
defense
fails
all
the
population
and
all
the
resources
of
europe
asia
africa
and
australasia
will
be
dominated
by
the
conquerors
let
us
remember
that
the
total
of
those
populations
and
their
resources
in
those
four
continents
greatly
exceeds
the
sum
total
of
the
population
and
the
resources
of
the
whole
of
the
western
hemispheremany
times
over
in
times
like
these
it
is
immatureand
incidentally
untruefor
anybody
to
brag
that
an
unprepared
america
singlehanded
and
with
one
hand
tied
behind
its
back
can
hold
off
the
whole
world
no
realistic
american
can
expect
from
a
dictators
peace
international
generosity
or
return
of
true
independence
or
world
disarmament
or
freedom
of
expression
or
freedom
of
religionor
even
good
business
such
a
peace
would
bring
no
security
for
us
or
for
our
neighbors
those
who
would
give
up
essential
liberty
to
purchase
a
little
temporary
safety
deserve
neither
liberty
nor
safety
as
a
nation
we
may
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
we
are
softhearted
but
we
cannot
afford
to
be
softheaded
we
must
always
be
wary
of
those
who
with
sounding
brass
and
a
tinkling
cymbal
preach
the
ism
of
appeasement
we
must
especially
beware
of
that
small
group
of
selfish
men
who
would
clip
the
wings
of
the
american
eagle
in
order
to
feather
their
own
nests
i
have
recently
pointed
out
how
quickly
the
tempo
of
modern
warfare
could
bring
into
our
very
midst
the
physical
attack
which
we
must
eventually
expect
if
the
dictator
nations
win
this
war
there
is
much
loose
talk
of
our
immunity
from
immediate
and
direct
invasion
from
across
the
seas
obviously
as
long
as
the
british
navy
retains
its
power
no
such
danger
exists
even
if
there
were
no
british
navy
it
is
not
probable
that
any
enemy
would
be
stupid
enough
to
attack
us
by
landing
troops
in
the
united
states
from
across
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
until
it
had
acquired
strategic
bases
from
which
to
operate
but
we
learn
much
from
the
lessons
of
the
past
years
in
europeparticularly
the
lesson
of
norway
whose
essential
seaports
were
captured
by
treachery
and
surprise
built
up
over
a
series
of
years
the
first
phase
of
the
invasion
of
this
hemisphere
would
not
be
the
landing
of
regular
troops
the
necessary
strategic
points
would
be
occupied
by
secret
agents
and
their
dupesand
great
numbers
of
them
are
already
here
and
in
latin
america
as
long
as
the
aggressor
nations
maintain
the
offensive
theynot
wewill
choose
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
method
of
their
attack
that
is
why
the
future
of
all
the
american
republics
is
today
in
serious
danger
that
is
why
this
annual
message
to
the
congress
is
unique
in
our
history
that
is
why
every
member
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
every
member
of
the
congress
faces
great
responsibility
and
great
accountability
the
need
of
the
moment
is
that
our
actions
and
our
policy
should
be
devoted
primarilyalmost
exclusivelyto
meeting
this
foreign
peril
for
all
our
domestic
problems
are
now
a
part
of
the
great
emergency
just
as
our
national
policy
in
internal
affairs
has
been
based
upon
a
decent
respect
for
the
rights
and
the
dignity
of
all
our
fellow
men
within
our
gates
so
our
national
policy
in
foreign
affairs
has
been
based
on
a
decent
respect
for
the
rights
and
dignity
of
all
nations
large
and
small
and
the
justice
of
morality
must
and
will
win
in
the
end
our
national
policy
is
this
first
by
an
impressive
expression
of
the
public
will
and
without
regard
to
partisanship
we
are
committed
to
allinclusive
national
defense
second
by
an
impressive
expression
of
the
public
will
and
without
regard
to
partisanship
we
are
committed
to
full
support
of
all
those
resolute
peoples
everywhere
who
are
resisting
aggression
and
are
thereby
keeping
war
away
from
our
hemisphere
by
this
support
we
express
our
determination
that
the
democratic
cause
shall
prevail
and
we
strengthen
the
defense
and
the
security
of
our
own
nation
third
by
an
impressive
expression
of
the
public
will
and
without
regard
to
partisanship
we
are
committed
to
the
proposition
that
principles
of
morality
and
considerations
for
our
own
security
will
never
permit
us
to
acquiesce
in
a
peace
dictated
by
aggressors
and
sponsored
by
appeasers
we
know
that
enduring
peace
cannot
be
bought
at
the
cost
of
other
peoples
freedom
in
the
recent
national
election
there
was
no
substantial
difference
between
the
two
great
parties
in
respect
to
that
national
policy
no
issue
was
fought
out
on
this
line
before
the
american
electorate
today
it
is
abundantly
evident
that
american
citizens
everywhere
are
demanding
and
supporting
speedy
and
complete
action
in
recognition
of
obvious
danger
therefore
the
immediate
need
is
a
swift
and
driving
increase
in
our
armament
production
leaders
of
industry
and
labor
have
responded
to
our
summons
goals
of
speed
have
been
set
in
some
cases
these
goals
are
being
reached
ahead
of
time
in
some
cases
we
are
on
schedule
in
other
cases
there
are
slight
but
not
serious
delays
and
in
some
casesand
i
am
sorry
to
say
very
important
caseswe
are
all
concerned
by
the
slowness
of
the
accomplishment
of
our
plans
the
army
and
navy
however
have
made
substantial
progress
during
the
past
year
actual
experience
is
improving
and
speeding
up
our
methods
of
production
with
every
passing
day
and
todays
best
is
not
good
enough
for
tomorrow
i
am
not
satisfied
with
the
progress
thus
far
made
the
men
in
charge
of
the
program
represent
the
best
in
training
in
ability
and
in
patriotism
they
are
not
satisfied
with
the
progress
thus
far
made
none
of
us
will
be
satisfied
until
the
job
is
done
no
matter
whether
the
original
goal
was
set
too
high
or
too
low
our
objective
is
quicker
and
better
results
to
give
you
two
illustrations
we
are
behind
schedule
in
turning
out
finished
airplanes
we
are
working
day
and
night
to
solve
the
innumerable
problems
and
to
catch
up
we
are
ahead
of
schedule
in
building
warships
but
we
are
working
to
get
even
further
ahead
of
that
schedule
to
change
a
whole
nation
from
a
basis
of
peacetime
production
of
implements
of
peace
to
a
basis
of
wartime

production
of
implements
of
war
is
no
small
task
and
the
greatest
difficulty
comes
at
the
beginning
of
the
program
when
new
tools
new
plant
facilities
new
assembly
lines
and
new
ship
ways
must
first
be
constructed
before
the
actual
materiel
begins
to
flow
steadily
and
speedily
from
them
the
congress
of
course
must
rightly
keep
itself
informed
at
all
times
of
the
progress
of
the
program
however
there
is
certain
information
as
the
congress
itself
will
readily
recognize
which
in
the
interests
of
our
own
security
and
those
of
the
nations
that
we
are
supporting
must
of
needs
be
kept
in
confidence
new
circumstances
are
constantly
begetting
new
needs
for
our
safety
i
shall
ask
this
congress
for
greatly
increased
new
appropriations
and
authorizations
to
carry
on
what
we
have
begun
i
also
ask
this
congress
for
authority
and
for
funds
sufficient
to
manufacture
additional
munitions
and
war
supplies
of
many
kinds
to
be
turned
over
to
those
nations
which
are
now
in
actual
war
with
aggressor
nations
our
most
useful
and
immediate
role
is
to
act
as
an
arsenal
for
them
as
well
as
for
ourselves
they
do
not
need
man
power
but
they
do
need
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
the
weapons
of
defense
the
time
is
near
when
they
will
not
be
able
to
pay
for
them
all
in
ready
cash
we
cannot
and
we
will
not
tell
them
that
they
must
surrender
merely
because
of
present
inability
to
pay
for
the
weapons
which
we
know
they
must
have
i
do
not
recommend
that
we
make
them
a
loan
of
dollars
with
which
to
pay
for
these
weaponsa
loan
to
be
repaid
in
dollars
i
recommend
that
we
make
it
possible
for
those
nations
to
continue
to
obtain
war
materials
in
the
united
states
fitting
their
orders
into
our
own
program
nearly
all
their
materiel
would
if
the
time
ever
came
be
useful
for
our
own
defense
taking
counsel
of
expert
military
and
naval
authorities
considering
what
is
best
for
our
own
security
we
are
free
to
decide
how
much
should
be
kept
here
and
how
much
should
be
sent
abroad
to
our
friends
who
by
their
determined
and
heroic
resistance
are
giving
us
time
in
which
to
make
ready
our
own
defense
for
what
we
send
abroad
we
shall
be
repaid
within
a
reasonable
time
following
the
close
of
hostilities
in
similar
materials
or
at
our
option
in
other
goods
of
many
kinds
which
they
can
produce
and
which
we
need
let
us
say
to
the
democracies
we
americans
are
vitally
concerned
in
your
defense
of
freedom
we
are
putting
forth
our
energies
our
resources
and
our
organizing
powers
to
give
you
the
strength
to
regain
and
maintain
a
free
world
we
shall
send
you
in
everincreasing
numbers
ships
planes
tanks
guns
this
is
our
purpose
and
our
pledge
in
fulfillment
of
this
purpose
we
will
not
be
intimidated
by
the
threats
of
dictators
that
they
will
regard
as
a
breach
of
international
law
or
as
an
act
of
war
our
aid
to
the
democracies
which
dare
to
resist
their
aggression
such
aid
is
not
an
act
of
war
even
if
a
dictator
should
unilaterally
proclaim
it
so
to
be
when
the
dictators
if
the
dictators
are
ready
to
make
war
upon
us
they
will
not
wait
for
an
act
of
war
on
our
part
they
did
not
wait
for
norway
or
belgium
or
the
netherlands
to
commit
an
act
of
war
their
only
interest
is
in
a
new
oneway
international
law
which
lacks
mutuality
in
its
observance
and
therefore
becomes
an
instrument
of
oppression
the
happiness
of
future
generations
of
americans
may
well
depend
upon
how
effective
and
how
immediate
we
can
make
our
aid
felt
no
one
can
tell
the
exact
character
of
the
emergency
situations
that
we
may
be
called
upon
to
meet
the
nations
hands
must
not
be
tied
when
the
nations
life
is
in
danger
we
must
all
prepare
to
make
the
sacrifices
that
the
emergencyalmost
as
serious
as
war
itselfdemands
whatever
stands
in
the
way
of
speed
and
efficiency
in
defense
preparations
must
give
way
to
the
national
need
a
free
nation
has
the
right
to
expect
full
cooperation
from
all
groups
a
free
nation
has
the
right
to
look
to
the
leaders
of
business
of
labor
and
of
agriculture
to
take
the
lead
in
stimulating
effort
not
among
other
groups
but
within
their
own
groups
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
the
few
slackers
or
trouble
makers
in
our
midst
is
first
to
shame
them
by
patriotic
example
and
if
that
fails
to
use
the
sovereignty
of
government
to
save
government
as
men
do
not
live
by
bread
alone
they
do
not
fight
by
armaments
alone
those
who
man
our
defenses
and
those
behind
them
who
build
our
defenses
must
have
the
stamina
and
the
courage
which
come
from
unshakable
belief
in
the
manner
of
life
which
they
are
defending
the
mighty
action
that
we
are
calling
for
cannot
be
based
on
a
disregard
of
all
things
worth
fighting
for
the
nation
takes
great
satisfaction
and
much
strength
from
the
things
which
have
been
done
to
make
its
people
conscious
of
their
individual
stake
in
the
preservation
of
democratic
life
in
america
those
things
have
toughened
the
fibre
of
our
people
have
renewed
their
faith
and
strengthened
their
devotion
to
the
institutions
we
make
ready
to
protect
certainly
this
is
no
time
for
any
of
us
to
stop
thinking
about
the
social
and
economic
problems
which
are
the
root
cause
of
the
social
revolution
which
is
today
a
supreme
factor
in
the
world
for
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
the
foundations
of
a
healthy
and
strong
democracy
the
basic
things
expected
by
our
people
of
their
political
and
economic
systems
are
simple
they
are
equality
of
opportunity
for
youth
and
for
others
jobs
for
those
who
can
work
security
for
those
who
need
it
the
ending
of
special
privilege
for
the
few
the
preservation
of
civil
liberties
for
all
the
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
scientific
progress
in
a
wider
and
constantly
rising
standard
of
living
these
are
the
simple
basic
things
that
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
in
the
turmoil
and
unbelievable
complexity
of
our
modern
world
the
inner
and
abiding
strength
of
our
economic
and
political
systems
is
dependent
upon
the
degree
to
which
they
fulfill
these
expectations
many
subjects
connected
with
our
social
economy
call
for
immediate
improvement
as
examples
we
should
bring
more
citizens
under
the
coverage
of
oldage
pensions
and
unemployment
insurance
we
should
widen
the
opportunities
for
adequate
medical
care
we
should
plan
a
better
system
by
which
persons
deserving
or
needing
gainful
employment
may
obtain
it
i
have
called
for
personal
sacrifice
i
am
assured
of
the
willingness
of
almost
all
americans
to
respond
to
that
call
a
part
of
the
sacrifice
means
the
payment
of
more
money
in
taxes
in
my
budget
message
i
shall
recommend
that
a
greater
portion
of
this
great
defense
program
be
paid
for
from
taxation
than
we
are
paying
today
no
person
should
try
or
be
allowed
to
get
rich
out
of
this
program
and
the
principle
of
tax
payments
in
accordance
with
ability
to
pay
should
be
constantly
before
our
eyes
to
guide
our
legislation
if
the
congress
maintains
these
principles
the
voters
putting
patriotism
ahead
of
pocketbooks
will
give
you
their
applause
in
the
future
days
which
we
seek
to
make
secure
we
look
forward
to
a
world
founded
upon
four
essential
human
freedoms
the
first
is
freedom
of
speech
and
expressioneverywhere
in
the
world
the
second
is
freedom
of
every
person
to
worship
god
in
his
own
wayeverywhere
in
the
world
the
third
is
freedom
from
wantwhich
translated
into
world
terms
means
economic
understandings
which
will
secure
to
every
nation
a
healthy
peacetime
life
for
its
inhabitantseverywhere
in
the
world
the
fourth
is
freedom
from
fearwhich
translated
into
world
terms
means
a
worldwide
reduction
of
armaments
to
such
a
point
and
in
such
a
thorough
fashion
that
no
nation
will
be
in
a
position
to
commit
an
act
of
physical
aggression
against
any
neighboranywhere
in
the
world
that
is
no
vision
of
a
distant
millennium
it
is
a
definite
basis
for
a
kind
of
world
attainable
in
our
own
time
and
generation
that
kind
of
world
is
the
very
antithesis
of
the
socalled
new
order
of
tyranny
which
the
dictators
seek
to
create
with
the
crash
of
a
bomb
to
that
new
order
we
oppose
the
greater
conceptionthe
moral
order
a
good
society
is
able
to
face
schemes
of
world
domination
and
foreign
revolutions
alike
without
fear
since
the
beginning
of
our
american
history
we
have
been
engaged
in
changein
a
perpetual
peaceful
revolutiona
revolution
which
goes
on
steadily
quietly
adjusting
itself
to
changing
conditionswithout
the
concentration
camp
or
the
quicklime
in
the
ditch
the
world
order
which
we
seek
is
the
cooperation
of
free
countries
working
together
in
a
friendly
civilized
society
this
nation
has
placed
its
destiny
in
the
hands
and
heads
and
hearts
of
its
millions
of
free
men
and
women
and
its
faith
in
freedom
under
the
guidance
of
god
freedom
means
the
supremacy
of
human
rights
everywhere
our
support
goes
to
those
who
struggle
to
gain
those
rights
or
keep
them
our
strength
is
our
unity
of
purpose
to
that
high
concept
there
can
be
no
end
save
victory

mr
vice
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
i
wish
each
and
every
one
of
you
a
very
happy
new
year
as
the
congress
reassembles
the
impact
of
war
abroad
makes
it
natural
to
approach
the
state
of
the
union
through
a
discussion
of
foreign
affairs
but
it
is
important
that
those
who
hear
and
read
this
message
should
in
no
way
confuse
that
approach
with
any
thought
that
our
government
is
abandoning
or
even
overlooking
the
great
significance
of
its
domestic
policies
the
social
and
economic
forces
which
have
been
mismanaged
abroad
until
they
have
resulted
in
revolution
dictatorship
and
war
are
the
same
as
those
which
we
here
are
struggling
to
adjust
peacefully
at
home
you
are
well
aware
that
dictatorshipsand
the
philosophy
of
force
that
justifies
and
accompanies
dictatorshipshave
originated
in
almost
every
case
in
the
necessity
for
drastic
action
to
improve
internal
conditions
in
places
where
democratic
action
for
one
reason
or
another
has
failed
to
respond
to
modern
needs
and
modern
demands
it
was
with
farsighted
wisdom
that
the
framers
of
our
constitution
brought
together
in
one
magnificent
phrase
three
great
conceptscommon
defense
general
welfare
and
domestic
tranquility
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
later
we
who
are
here
today
still
believe
with
them
that
our
best
defense
is
the
promotion
of
our
general
welfare
and
domestic
tranquillity
in
previous
messages
to
the
congress
i
have
repeatedly
warned
that
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
daily
lives
of
american
citizens
will
of
necessity
feel
the
shock
of
events
on
other
continents
this
is
no
longer
mere
theory
because
it
has
been
definitely
proved
to
us
by
the
facts
of
yesterday
and
today
to
say
that
the
domestic
wellbeing
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
million
americans
is
deeply
affected
by
the
wellbeing
or
the
illbeing
of
the
populations
of
other
nations
is
only
to
recognize
in
world
affairs
the
truth
that
we
all
accept
in
home
affairs
if
in
any
local
unita
city
county
state
or
regionlow
standards
of
living
are
permitted
to
continue
the
level
of
the
civilization
of
the
entire
nation
will
be
pulled
downward
the
identical
principle
extends
to
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
but
there
are
those
who
wishfully
insist
in
innocence
or
ignorance
or
both
that
the
united
states
of
america
as
a
selfcontained
unit
can
live
happily
and
prosperously
its
future
secure
inside
a
high
wall
of
isolation
while
outside
the
rest
of
civilization
and
the
commerce
and
culture
of
mankind
are
shattered
i
can
understand
the
feelings
of
those
who
warn
the
nation
that
they
will
never
again
consent
to
the
sending
of
american
youth
to
fight
on
the
soil
of
europe
but
as
i
remember
nobody
has
asked
them
to
consentfor
nobody
expects
such
an
undertaking
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
fellow
citizens
do
not
abandon
in
the
slightest
their
hope
and
their
expectation
that
the
united
states
will
not
become
involved
in
military
participation
in
these
wars
i
can
also
understand
the
wishfulness
of
those
who
oversimplify
the
whole
situation
by
repeating
that
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
mind
our
own
business
and
keep
the
nation
out
of
war
but
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
keeping
out
of
war
and
pretending
that
this
war
is
none
of
our
business
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
war
with
other
nations
but
at
least
we
can
strive
with
other
nations
to
encourage
the
kind
of
peace
that
will
lighten
the
troubles
of
the
world
and
by
so
doing
help
our
own
nation
as
well
i
ask
that
all
of
us
everywhere
think
things
through
with
the
single
aim
of
how
best
to
serve
the
future
of
our
own
nation
i
do
not
mean
merely
its
future
relationship
with
the
outside
world
i
mean
its
domestic
future
as
wellthe
work
the
security
the
prosperity
the
happiness
the
life
of
all
the
boys
and
girls
in
the
united
states
as
they
are
inevitably
affected
by
such
world
relationships
for
it
becomes
clearer
and
clearer
that
the
future
world
will
be
a
shabby
and
dangerous
place
to
live
inyes
even
for
americans
to
live
inif
it
is
ruled
by
force
in
the
hands
of
a
few
already
the
crash
of
swiftly
moving
events
over
the
earth
has
made
us
all
think
with
a
longer
view
fortunately
that
thinking
cannot
be
controlled
by
partisanship
the
time
is
long
past
when
any
political
party
or
any
particular
group
can
curry
or
capture
public
favor
by
labeling
itself
the
peace
party
or
the
peace
bloc
that
label
belongs
to
the
whole
united
states
and
to
every
right
thinking
man
woman
and
child
within
it
for
out
of
all
the
military
and
diplomatic
turmoil
out
of
all
the
propaganda
and
counterpropaganda
of
the
present
conflicts
there
are
two
facts
which
stand
out
and
which
the
whole
world
acknowledges
the
first
is
that
never
before
has
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
done
so
much
as
in
our
recent
past
to
establish
and
maintain
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
with
its
sister
nations
the
second
is
that
in
almost
every
nation
in
the
world
today
there
is
a
true
public
belief
that
the
united
states
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
a
potent
and
active
factor
in
seeking
the
reestablishment
of
world
peace
in
these
recent
years
we
have
had
a
clean
record
of
peace
and
goodwill
it
is
an
open
book
that
cannot
be
twisted
or
defamed
it
is
a
record
that
must
be
continued
and
enlarged
so
i
hope
that
americans
everywhere
will
work
out
for
themselves
the
several
alternatives
which
lie
before
world
civilization
which
necessarily
includes
our
own
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
possibilities
for
our
children
if
the
rest
of
the
world
comes
to
be
dominated
by
concentrated
force
aloneeven
though
today
we
are
a
very
great
and
a
very
powerful
nation
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
effect
on
our
own
future
if
all
the
small
nations
of
the
world
have
their
independence
snatched
from
them
or
become
mere
appendages
to
relatively
vast
and
powerful
military
systems
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
kind
of
lives
our
children
would
have
to
lead
if
a
large
part
of
the
rest
of
the
world
were
compelled
to
worship
a
god
imposed
by
a
military
ruler
or
were
forbidden
to
worship
god
at
all
if
the
rest
of
the
world
were
forbidden
to
read
and
hear
the
factsthe
daily
news
of
their
own
and
other
nationsif
they
were
deprived
of
the
truth
that
makes
men
free
we
must
look
ahead
and
see
the
effect
on
our
future
generations
if
world
trade
is
controlled
by
any
nation
or
group
of
nations
which
sets
up
that
control
through
military
force
it
is
of
course
true
that
the
record
of
past
centuries
includes
destruction
of
many
small
nations
the
enslavement
of
peoples
and
the
building
of
empires
on
the
foundation
of
force
but
wholly
apart
from
the
greater
international
morality
which
we
seek
today
we
recognize
the
practical
fact
that
with
modern
weapons
and
modern
conditions
modern
man
can
no
longer
lead
a
civilized
life
if
we
are
to
go
back
to
the
practice
of
wars
and
conquests
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
summing
up
this
need
of
looking
ahead
and
in
words
of
common
sense
and
good
american
citizenship
i
hope
that
we
shall
have
fewer
american
ostriches
in
our
midst
it
is
not
good
for
the
ultimate
health
of
ostriches
to
bury
their
heads
in
the
sand
only
an
ostrich
would
look
upon
these
wars
through
the
eyes
of
cynicism
or
ridicule
of
course
the
peoples
of
other
nations
have
the
right
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
but
we
in
this
nation
still
believe
that
such
choice
should
be
predicated
on
certain
freedoms
which
we
think
are
essential
everywhere
we
know
that
we
ourselves
shall
never
be
wholly
safe
at
home
unless
other
governments
recognize
such
freedoms
twentyone
american
republics
expressing
the
will
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
people
to
preserve
peace
and
freedom
in
this
hemisphere
are
displaying
a
unanimity
of
ideals
and
practical
relationships
which
gives
hope
that
what
is
being
done
here
can
be
done
on
other
continents
we
in
all
the
americas
are
coming
to
the
realization
that
we
can
retain
our
respective
nationalities
without
at
the
same
time
threatening
the
national
existence
of
our
neighbors
such
truly
friendly
relationships
for
example
permit
us
to
follow
our
own
domestic
policies
with
reference
to
our
agricultural
products
while
at
the
same
time
we
have
the
privilege
of
trying
to
work
out
mutual
assistance
arrangements
for
a
world
distribution
of
world
agricultural
surpluses
and
we
have
been
able
to
apply
the
same
simple
principle
to
many
manufactured
productssurpluses
of
which
must
be
sold
in
the
world
export
markets
if
we
intend
to
continue
a
high
level
of
production
and
employment
for
many
years
after
the
world
war
blind
economic
selfishness
in
most
countries
including
our
own
resulted
in
a
destructive
minefield
of
trade
restrictions
which
blocked
the
channels
of
commerce
among
nations
indeed
this
policy
was
one
of
the
contributing
causes
of
existing
wars
it
dammed
up
vast
unsalable
surpluses
helping
to
bring
about
unemployment
and
suffering
in
the
united
states
and
everywhere
else
to
point
the
way
to
break
up
that
logjam
our
trade
agreements
act
was
passedbased
upon
a
policy
of
equality
of
treatment
among
nations
and
of
mutually
profitable
arrangements
of
trade
it
is
not
correct
to
infer
that
legislative
powers
have
been
transferred
from
the
congress
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
everyone
recognizes
that
general
tariff
legislation
is
a
congressional
function
but
we
know
that
because
of
the
stupendous
task
involved
in
the
fashioning
and
the
passing
of
a
general
tariff
law
it
is
advisable
to
provide
at
times
of
emergency
some
flexibility
to
make
the
general
law
adjustable
to
quickly
changing
conditions
we
are
in
such
a
time
today
our
present
trade
agreement
method
provides
a
temporary
flexibility
and
is
therefore
practical
in
the
best
sense
it
should
be
kept
alive
to
serve
our
trade
interestsagricultural
and
industrialin
many
valuable
ways
during
the
existing
wars
but
what
is
more
important
the
trade
agreements
act
should
be
extended
as
an
indispensable
part
of
the
foundation
of
any
stable
and
enduring
peace
the
old
conditions
of
world
trade
made

for
no
enduring
peace
and
when
the
time
comes
the
united
states
must
use
its
influence
to
open
up
the
trade
channels
of
the
world
in
all
nations
in
order
that
no
one
nation
need
feel
compelled
in
later
days
to
seek
by
force
of
arms
what
it
can
well
gain
by
peaceful
conference
for
that
purpose
too
we
need
the
trade
agreements
act
even
more
today
than
when
it
was
passed
i
emphasize
the
leadership
which
this
nation
can
take
when
the
time
comes
for
a
renewal
of
world
peace
such
an
influence
will
be
greatly
weakened
if
this
government
becomes
a
dog
in
the
manger
of
trade
selfishness
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
warned
us
against
entangling
foreign
alliances
the
present
president
of
the
united
states
subscribes
to
and
follows
that
precept
i
hope
that
most
of
you
will
agree
that
trade
cooperation
with
the
rest
of
the
world
does
not
violate
that
precept
in
any
way
even
as
through
these
trade
agreements
we
prepare
to
cooperate
in
a
world
that
wants
peace
we
must
likewise
be
prepared
to
take
care
of
ourselves
if
the
world
cannot
attain
peace
for
several
years
past
we
have
been
compelled
to
strengthen
our
own
national
defense
that
has
created
a
very
large
portion
of
our
treasury
deficits
this
year
in
the
light
of
continuing
world
uncertainty
i
am
asking
the
congress
for
army
and
navy
increases
which
are
based
not
on
panic
but
on
common
sense
they
are
not
as
great
as
enthusiastic
alarmists
seek
they
are
not
as
small
as
unrealistic
persons
claiming
superior
private
information
would
demand
as
will
appear
in
the
annual
budget
tomorrow
the
only
important
increase
in
any
part
of
the
budget
is
the
estimate
for
national
defense
practically
all
other
important
items
show
a
reduction
but
you
know
you
cant
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
too
therefore
in
the
hope
that
we
can
continue
in
these
days
of
increasing
economic
prosperity
to
reduce
the
federal
deficit
i
am
asking
the
congress
to
levy
sufficient
additional
taxes
to
meet
the
emergency
spending
for
national
defense
behind
the
army
and
navy
of
course
lies
our
ultimate
line
of
defensethe
general
welfare
of
our
people
we
cannot
report
despite
all
the
progress
that
we
have
made
in
our
domestic
problemsdespite
the
fact
that
production
is
back
to
levelsthat
all
our
problems
are
solved
the
fact
of
unemployment
of
millions
of
men
and
women
remains
a
symptom
of
a
number
of
difficulties
in
our
economic
system
not
yet
adjusted
while
the
number
of
the
unemployed
has
decreased
very
greatly
while
their
immediate
needs
for
food
and
clothingas
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concernedhave
been
largely
met
while
their
morale
has
been
kept
alive
by
giving
them
useful
public
work
we
have
not
yet
found
a
way
to
employ
the
surplus
of
our
labor
which
the
efficiency
of
our
industrial
processes
has
created
we
refuse
the
european
solution
of
using
the
unemployed
to
build
up
excessive
armaments
which
eventually
result
in
dictatorships
and
war
we
encourage
an
american
waythrough
an
increase
of
national
income
which
is
the
only
way
we
can
be
sure
will
take
up
the
slack
much
progress
has
been
made
much
remains
to
be
done
we
recognize
that
we
must
find
an
answer
in
terms
of
work
and
opportunity
the
unemployment
problem
today
has
become
very
definitely
a
problem
of
youth
as
well
as
of
age
as
each
year
has
gone
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
boys
and
girls
have
come
of
working
age
they
now
form
an
army
of
unused
youth
they
must
be
an
especial
concern
of
democratic
government
we
must
continue
above
all
things
to
look
for
a
solution
of
their
special
problem
for
they
looking
ahead
to
life
are
entitled
to
action
on
our
part
and
not
merely
to
admonitions
of
optimism
or
lectures
on
economic
laws
some
in
our
midst
have
sought
to
instill
a
feeling
of
fear
and
defeatism
in
the
minds
of
the
american
people
about
this
problem
to
face
the
task
of
finding
jobs
faster
than
invention
can
take
them
awayis
not
defeatism
to
warble
easy
platitudes
that
if
we
would
only
go
back
to
ways
that
have
failed
everything
would
be
all
rightis
not
courage
in
we
met
a
problem
of
real
fear
and
real
defeatism
we
faced
the
factswith
action
and
not
with
words
alone
the
american
people
will
reject
the
doctrine
of
fear
confident
that
in
the
thirties
we
have
been
building
soundly
a
new
order
of
things
different
from
the
order
of
the
twenties
in
this
dawn
of
the
decade
of
the
forties
with
our
program
of
social
improvement
started
we
will
continue
to
carry
on
the
processes
of
recovery
so
as
to
preserve
our
gains
and
provide
jobs
at
living
wages
there
are
of
course
many
other
items
of
great
public
interest
which
could
be
enumerated
in
this
messagethe
continued
conservation
of
our
natural
resources
the
improvement
of
health
and
of
education
the
extension
of
social
security
to
larger
groups
the
freeing
of
large
areas
from
restricted
transportation
discriminations
the
extension
of
the
merit
system
and
many
others
our
continued
progress
in
the
social
and
economic
field
is
important
not
only
for
the
significance
of
each
part
of
it
but
for
the
total
effect
which
our
program
of
domestic
betterment
has
upon
that
most
valuable
asset
of
a
nation
in
dangerous
timesits
national
unity
the
permanent
security
of
america
in
the
present
crisis
does
not
lie
in
armed
force
alone
what
we
face
is
a
set
of
worldwide
forces
of
disintegrationvicious
ruthless
destructive
of
all
the
moral
religious
and
political
standards
which
mankind
after
centuries
of
struggle
has
come
to
cherish
most
in
these
moral
values
in
these
forces
which
have
made
our
nation
great
we
must
actively
and
practically
reassert
our
faith
these
wordsnational
unitymust
not
be
allowed
to
be
come
merely
a
highsounding
phrase
a
vague
generality
a
pious
hope
to
which
everyone
can
give
lipservice
they
must
be
made
to
have
real
meaning
in
terms
of
the
daily
thoughts
and
acts
of
every
man
woman
and
child
in
our
land
during
the
coming
year
and
during
the
years
that
lie
ahead
for
national
unity
is
in
a
very
real
and
a
very
deep
sense
the
fundamental
safeguard
of
all
democracy
doctrines
that
set
group
against
group
faith
against
faith
race
against
race
class
against
class
fanning
the
fires
of
hatred
in
men
too
despondent
too
desperate
to
think
for
themselves
were
used
as
rabblerousing
slogans
on
which
dictators
could
ride
to
power
and
once
in
power
they
could
saddle
their
tyrannies
on
whole
nations
and
on
their
weaker
neighbors
this
is
the
danger
to
which
we
in
america
must
begin
to
be
more
alert
for
the
apologists
for
foreign
aggressors
and
equally
those
selfish
and
partisan
groups
at
home
who
wrap
themselves
in
a
false
mantle
of
americanism
to
promote
their
own
economic
financial
or
political
advantage
are
now
trying
european
tricks
upon
us
seeking
to
muddy
the
stream
of
our
national
thinking
weakening
us
in
the
face
of
danger
by
trying
to
set
our
own
people
to
fighting
among
themselves
such
tactics
are
what
have
helped
to
plunge
europe
into
war
we
must
combat
them
as
we
would
the
plague
if
american
integrity
and
american
security
are
to
be
preserved
we
cannot
afford
to
face
the
future
as
a
disunited
people
we
must
as
a
united
people
keep
ablaze
on
this
continent
the
flames
of
human
liberty
of
reason
of
democracy
and
of
fair
play
as
living
things
to
be
preserved
for
the
better
world
that
is
to
come
overstatement
bitterness
vituperation
and
the
beating
of
drums
have
contributed
mightily
to
illfeeling
and
wars
between
nations
if
these
unnecessary
and
unpleasant
actions
are
harmful
in
the
international
field
if
they
have
hurt
in
other
parts
of
the
world
they
are
also
harmful
in
the
domestic
scene
peace
among
ourselves
would
seem
to
have
some
of
the
advantage
of
peace
between
us
and
other
nations
in
the
long
run
history
amply
demonstrates
that
angry
controversy
surely
wins
less
than
calm
discussion
in
the
spirit
therefore
of
a
greater
unselfishness
recognizing
that
the
worldincluding
the
united
states
of
americapasses
through
perilous
times
i
am
very
hopeful
that
the
closing
session
of
the
seventysixth
congress
will
consider
the
needs
of
the
nation
and
of
humanity
with
calmness
with
tolerance
and
with
cooperative
wisdom
may
the
year
be
pointed
to
by
our
children
as
another
period
when
democracy
justified
its
existence
as
the
best
instrument
of
government
yet
devised
by
mankind

mr
vice
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
senate
and
the
congress
in
reporting
on
the
state
of
the
nation
i
have
felt
it
necessary
on
previous
occasions
to
advise
the
congress
of
disturbance
abroad
and
of
the
need
of
putting
our
own
house
in
order
in
the
face
of
storm
signals
from
across
the
seas
as
this
seventysixth
congress
opens
there
is
need
for
further
warning
a
war
which
threatened
to
envelop
the
world
in
flames
has
been
averted
but
it
has
become
increasingly
clear
that
world
peace
is
not
assured
all
about
us
rage
undeclared
warsmilitary
and
economic
all
about
us
grow
more
deadly
armamentsmilitary
and
economic
all
about
us
are
threats
of
new
aggression
military
and
economic
storms
from
abroad
directly
challenge
three
institutions
indispensable
to
americans
now
as
always
the
first
is
religion
it
is
the
source
of
the
other
twodemocracy
and
international
good
faith
religion
by
teaching
man
his
relationship
to
god
gives
the
individual
a
sense
of
his
own
dignity
and
teaches
him
to
respect
himself
by
respecting
his
neighbors
democracy
the
practice
of
selfgovernment
is
a
covenant
among
free
men
to
respect
the
rights
and
liberties
of
their
fellows
international
good
faith
a
sister
of
democracy
springs
from
the
will
of
civilized
nations
of
men
to
respect
the
rights
and
liberties
of
other
nations
of
men
in
a
modern
civilization
all
threereligion
democracy
and
international
good
faithcomplement
and
support
each
other
where
freedom
of
religion
has
been
attacked
the
attack
has
come
from
sources
opposed
to
democracy
where
democracy
has
been
overthrown
the
spirit
of
free
worship
has
disappeared
and
where
religion
and
democracy
have
vanished
good
faith
and
reason
in
international
affairs
have
given
way
to
strident
ambition
and
brute
force
an
ordering
of
society
which
relegates
religion
democracy
and
good
faith
among
nations
to
the
background
can
find
no
place
within
it
for
the
ideals
of
the
prince
of
peace
the
united
states
rejects
such
an
ordering
and
retains
its
ancient
faith
there
comes
a
time
in
the
affairs
of
men
when
they
must
prepare
to
defend
not
their
homes
alone
but
the
tenets
of
faith
and
humanity
on
which
their
churches
their
governments
and
their
very
civilization
are
founded
the
defense
of
religion
of
democracy
and
of
good
faith
among
nations
is
all
the
same
fight
to
save
one
we
must
now
make
up
our
minds
to
save
all
we
know
what
might
happen
to
us
of
the
united
states
if
the
new
philosophies
of
force
were
to
encompass
the
other
continents
and
invade
our
own
we
no
more
than
other
nations
can
afford
to
be
surrounded
by
the
enemies
of
our
faith
and
our
humanity
fortunate
it
is
therefore
that
in
this
western
hemisphere
we
have
under
a
common
ideal
of
democratic
government
a
rich
diversity
of
resources
and
of
peoples
functioning
together
in
mutual
respect
and
peace
that
hemisphere
that
peace
and
that
ideal
we
propose
to
do
our
share
in
protecting
against
storms
from
any
quarter
our
people
and
our
resources
are
pledged
to
secure
that
protection
from
that
determination
no
american
flinches
this
by
no
means
implies
that
the
american
republics
disassociate
themselves
from
the
nations
of
other
continents
it
does
not
mean
the
americas
against
the
rest
of
the
world
we
as
one
of
the
republics
reiterate
our
willingness
to
help
the
cause
of
world
peace
we
stand
on
our
historic
offer
to
take
counsel
with
all
other
nations
of
the
world
to
the
end
that
aggression
among
them
be
terminated
that
the
race
of
armaments
cease
and
that
commerce
be
renewed
but
the
world
has
grown
so
small
and
weapons
of
attack
so
swift
that
no
nation
can
be
safe
in
its
will
to
peace
so
long
as
any
other
powerful
nation
refuses
to
settle
its
grievances
at
the
council
table
for
if
any
government
bristling
with
implements
of
war
insists
on
policies
of
force
weapons
of
defense
give
the
only
safety
in
our
foreign
relations
we
have
learned
from
the
past
what
not
to
do
from
new
wars
we
have
learned
what
we
must
do
we
have
learned
that
effective
timing
of
defense
and
the
distant
points
from
which
attacks
may
be
launched
are
completely
different
from
what
they
were
twenty
years
ago
we
have
learned
that
survival
cannot
be
guaranteed
by
arming
after
the
attack
beginsfor
there
is
new
range
and
speed
to
offense
we
have
learned
that
long
before
any
overt
military
act
aggression
begins
with
preliminaries
of
propaganda
subsidized
penetration
the
loosening
of
ties
of
good
will
the
stirring
of
prejudice
and
the
incitement
to
disunion
we
have
learned
that
godfearing
democracies
of
the
world
which
observe
the
sanctity
of
treaties
and
good
faith
in
their
dealings
with
other
nations
cannot
safely
be
indifferent
to
international
lawlessness
anywhere
they
cannot
forever
let
pass
without
effective
protest
acts
of
aggression
against
sister
nationsacts
which
automatically
undermine
all
of
us
obviously
they
must
proceed
along
practical
peaceful
lines
but
the
mere
fact
that
we
rightly
decline
to
intervene
with
arms
to
prevent
acts
of
aggression
does
not
mean
that
we
must
act
as
if
there
were
no
aggression
at
all
words
may
be
futile
but
war
is
not
the
only
means
of
commanding
a
decent
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
there
are
many
methods
short
of
war
but
stronger
and
more
effective
than
mere
words
of
bringing
home
to
aggressor
governments
the
aggregate
sentiments
of
our
own
people
at
the
very
least
we
can
and
should
avoid
any
action
or
any
lack
of
action
which
will
encourage
assist
or
build
up
an
aggressor
we
have
learned
that
when
we
deliberately
try
to
legislate
neutrality
our
neutrality
laws
may
operate
unevenly
and
unfairlymay
actually
give
aid
to
an
aggressor
and
deny
it
to
the
victim
the
instinct
of
selfpreservation
should
warn
us
that
we
ought
not
to
let
that
happen
any
more
and
we
have
learned
something
elsethe
old
old
lesson
that
probability
of
attack
is
mightily
decreased
by
the
assurance
of
an
ever
ready
defense
since
nearly
eight
years
ago
world
events
of
thunderous
import
have
moved
with
lightning
speed
during
these
eight
years
many
of
our
people
clung
to
the
hope
that
the
innate
decency
of
mankind
would
protect
the
unprepared
who
showed
their
innate
trust
in
mankind
today
we
are
all
wiserand
sadder
under
modern
conditions
what
we
mean
by
adequate
defensea
policy
subscribed
to
by
all
of
usmust
be
divided
into
three
elements
first
we
must
have
armed
forces
and
defenses
strong
enough
to
ward
off
sudden
attack
against
strategic
positions
and
key
facilities
essential
to
ensure
sustained
resistance
and
ultimate
victory
secondly
we
must
have
the
organization
and
location
of
those
key
facilities
so
that
they
may
be
immediately
utilized
and
rapidly
expanded
to
meet
all
needs
without
danger
of
serious
interruption
by
enemy
attack
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
i
shall
send
you
a
special
message
making
recommendations
for
those
two
essentials
of
defense
against
danger
which
we
cannot
safely
assume
will
not
come
if
these
first
two
essentials
are
reasonably
provided
for
we
must
be
able
confidently
to
invoke
the
third
element
the
underlying
strength
of
citizenshipthe
selfconfidence
the
ability
the
imagination
and
the
devotion
that
give
the
staying
power
to
see
things
through
a
strong
and
united
nation
may
be
destroyed
if
it
is
unprepared
against
sudden
attack
but
even
a
nation
well
armed
and
well
organized
from
a
strictly
military
standpoint
may
after
a
period
of
time
meet
defeat
if
it
is
unnerved
by
selfdistrust
endangered
by
class
prejudice
by
dissension
between
capital
and
labor
by
false
economy
and
by
other
unsolved
social
problems
at
home
in
meeting
the
troubles
of
the
world
we
must
meet
them
as
one
peoplewith
a
unity
born
of
the
fact
that
for
generations
those
who
have
come
to
our
shores
representing
many
kindreds
and
tongues
have
been
welded
by
common
opportunity
into
a
united
patriotism
if
another
form
of
government
can
present
a
united
front
in
its
attack
on
a
democracy
the
attack
must
and
will
be
met
by
a
united
democracy
such
a
democracy
can
and
must
exist
in
the
united
states
a
dictatorship
may
command
the
full
strength
of
a
regimented
nation
but
the
united
strength
of
a
democratic
nation
can
be
mustered
only
when
its
people
educated
by
modern
standards
to
know
what
is
going
on
and
where
they
are
going
have
conviction
that
they
are
receiving
as
large
a
share
of
opportunity
for
development
as
large
a
share
of
material
success
and
of
human
dignity
as
they
have
a
right
to
receive
our
nations
program
of
social
and
economic
reform
is
therefore
a
part
of
defense
as
basic
as
armaments
themselves
against
the
background
of
events
in
europe
in
africa
and
in
asia
during
these
recent
years
the
pattern
of
what
we
have
accomplished
since
appears
in
even
clearer
focus
for
the
first
time
we
have
moved
upon
deepseated
problems
affecting
our
national
strength
and
have
forged
national
instruments
adequate
to
meet
them
consider
what
the
seemingly
piecemeal
struggles
of
these
six
years
add
up
to
in
terms
of
realistic
national
preparedness
we
are
conserving
and
developing
natural
resourcesland
water
power
forests
we
are
trying
to
provide
necessary
food
shelter
and
medical
care
for
the
health
of
our
population
we
are
putting
agricultureour
system
of
food
and

a
sounder
basis
we
are
strengthening
the
weakest
spot
in
our
system
of
industrial
supply
its
long
smouldering
labor
difficulties
we
have
cleaned
up
our
credit
system
so
that
depositor
and
investor
alike
may
more
readily
and
willingly
make
their
capital
available
for
peace
or
war
we
are
giving
to
our
youth
new
opportunities
for
work
and
education
we
have
sustained
the
morale
of
all
the
population
by
the
dignified
recognition
of
our
obligations
to
the
aged
the
helpless
and
the
needy
above
all
we
have
made
the
american
people
conscious
of
their
interrelationship
and
their
interdependence
they
sense
a
common
destiny
and
a
common
need
of
each
other
differences
of

and

no
longer
obscure

fundamental
unity
in

and
in
action
we
have
our
difficulties
truebut
we
are
a
wis
er
and
a
tougher
nation
than
we
were
in
or
in
never
have
there
been
six
years
of
such
farflung
internal
preparedness
in
our
history
and
this
has
been
done
without
any
dictators
power
to
command
without
conscription
of
labor
or
confiscation
of
capital
without
concentration
camps
and
without
a
scratch
on
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
the
press
or
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
we
see
things
now
that
we
could
not
see
along
the
way
the
tools
of
government
which
we
had
in
are
outmoded
we
have
had
to
forge
new
tools
for
a
new
role
of
government
operating
in
a
democracya
role
of
new
responsibility
for
new
needs
and
increased
responsibility
for
old
needs
long
neglected
some
of
these
tools
had
to
be
roughly
shaped
and
still
need
some
machining
down
many
of
those
who
fought
bitterly
against
the
forging
of
these
new
tools
welcome
their
use
today
the
american
people
as
a
whole
have
accepted
them
the
nation
looks
to
the
congress
to
improve
the
new
machinery
which
we
have
permanently
installed
provided
that
in
the
process
the
social
usefulness
of
the
machinery
is
not
destroyed
or
impaired
all
of
us
agree
that
we
should
simplify
and
improve
laws
if
experience
and
operation
clearly
demonstrate
the
need
for
instance
all
of
us
want
better
provision
for
our
older
people
under
our
social
security
legislation
for
the
medically
needy
we
must
provide
better
care
most
of
us
agree
that
for
the
sake
of
employer
and
employee
alike
we
must
find
ways
to
end
factional
labor
strife
and
employeremployee
disputes
most
of
us
recognize
that
none
of
these
tools
can
be
put
to
maximum
effectiveness
unless
the
executive
processes
of
government
are
revampedreorganized
if
you
willinto
more
effective
combination
and
even
after
such
reorganization
it
will
take
time
to
develop
administrative
personnel
and
experience
in
order
to
use
our
new
tools
with
a
minimum
of
mistakes
the
congress
of
course
needs
no
further
information
on
this
with
this
exception
of
legislation
to
provide
greater
government
efficiency
and
with
the
exception
of
legislation
to
ameliorate
our
railroad
and
other
transportation
problems
the
past
three
congresses
have
met
in
part
or
in
whole
the
pressing
needs
of
the
new
order
of
things
we
have
now
passed
the
period
of
internal
conflict
in
the
launching
of
our
program
of
social
reform
our
full
energies
may
now
be
released
to
invigorate
the
processes
of
recovery
in
order
to
preserve
our
reforms
and
to
give
every
man
and
woman
who
wants
to
work
a
real
job
at
a
living
wage
but
time
is
of
paramount
importance
the
deadline
of
danger
from
within
and
from
without
is
not
within
our
control
the
hourglass
may
be
in
the
hands
of
other
nations
our
own
hourglass
tells
us
that
we
are
off
on
a
race
to
make
democracy
work
so
that
we
may
be
efficient
in
peace
and
therefore
secure
in
national
defense
this
time
element
forces
us
to
still
greater
efforts
to
attain
the
full
employment
of
our
labor
and
our
capital
the
first
duty
of
our
statesmanship
is
to
bring
capital
and
manpower
together
dictatorships
do
this
by
main
force
by
using
main
force
they
apparently
succeed
at
itfor
the
moment
however
we
abhor
their
methods
we
are
compelled
to
admit
that
they
have
obtained
substantial
utilization
of
all
their
material
and
human
resources
like
it
or
not
they
have
solved
for
a
time
at
least
the
problem
of
idle
men
and
idle
capital
can
we
compete
with
them
by
boldly
seeking
methods
of
putting
idle
men
and
idle
capital
together
and
at
the
same
time
remain
within
our
american
way
of
life
within
the
bill
of
rights
and
within
the
bounds
of
what
is
from
our
point
of
view
civilization
itself
we
suffer
from
a
great
unemployment
of
capital
many
people
have
the
idea
that
as
a
nation
we
are
overburdened
with
debt
and
are
spending
more
than
we
can
afford
that
is
not
so
despite
our
federal
government
expenditures
the
entire
debt
of
our
national
economic
system
public
and
private
together
is
no
larger
today
than
it
was
in
and
the
interest
thereon
is
far
less
than
it
was
in
the
object
is
to
put
capitalprivate
as
well
as
publicto
work
we
want
to
get
enough
capital
and
labor
at
work
to
give
us
a
total
turnover
of
business
a
total
national
income
of
at
least
eighty
billion
dollars
a
year
at
that
figure
we
shall
have
a
substantial
reduction
of
unemployment
and
the
federal
revenues
will
be
sufficient
to
balance
the
current
level
of
cash
expenditures
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
tax
structure
that
figure
can
be
attained
working
within
the
framework
of
our
traditional
profit
system
the
factors
in
attaining
and
maintaining
that
amount
of
national
income
are
many
and
complicated
they
include
more
widespread
understanding
among
business
men
of
many
changes
which
world
conditions
and
technological
improvements
have
brought
to
our
economy
over
the
last
twenty
yearschanges
in
the
interrelationship
of
price
and
volume
and
employment
for
examplechanges
of
the
kind
in
which
business
men
are
now
educating
themselves
through
excellent
opportunities
like
the
socalled
monopoly
investigation
they
include
a
perfecting
of
our
farm
program
to
protect
farmers
income
and
consumers
purchasing
power
from
alternate
risks
of
crop
gluts
and
crop
shortages
they
include
wholehearted
acceptance
of
new
standards
of
honesty
in
our
financial
markets
they
include
reconcilement
of
enormous
antagonistic
interestssome
of
them
long
in
litigationin
the
railroad
and
general
transportation
field
they
include
the
working
out
of
new
techniquesprivate
state
and
federalto
protect
the
public
interest
in
and
to
develop
wider
markets
for
electric
power
they
include
a
revamping
of
the
tax
relationships
between
federal
state
and
local
units
of
government
and
consideration
of
relatively
small
tax
increases
to
adjust
inequalities
without
interfering
with
the
aggregate
income
of
the
american
people
they
include
the
perfecting
of
labor
organization
and
a
universal
ungrudging
attitude
by
employers
toward
the
labor
movement
until
there
is
a
minimum
of
interruption
of
production
and
employment
because
of
disputes
and
acceptance
by
labor
of
the
truth
that
the
welfare
of
labor
itself
depends
on
increased
balanced
output
of
goods
to
be
immediately
practical
while
proceeding
with
a
steady
evolution
in
the
solving
of
these
and
like
problems
we
must
wisely
use
instrumentalities
like
federal
investment
which
are
immediately
available
to
us
here
as
elsewhere
time
is
the
deciding
factor
in
our
choice
of
remedies
therefore
it
does
not
seem
logical
to
me
at
the
moment
we
seek
to
increase
production
and
consumption
for
the
federal
government
to
consider
a
drastic
curtailment
of
its
own
investments
the
whole
subject
of
government
investing
and
government
income
is
one
which
may
be
approached
in
two
different
ways
the
first
calls
for
the
elimination
of
enough
activities
of
government
to
bring
the
expenses
of
government
immediately
into
balance
with
income
of
government
this
school
of
thought
maintains
that
because
our
national
income
this
year
is
only
sixty
billion
dollars
ours
is
only
a
sixty
billion
dollar
country
that
government
must
treat
it
as
such
and
that
without
the
help
of
government
it
may
some
day
somehow
happen
to
become
an
eighty
billion
dollar
country
if
the
congress
decides
to
accept
this
point
of
view
it
will
logically
have
to
reduce
the
present
functions
or
activities
of
government
by
onethird
not
only
will
the
congress
have
to
accept
the
responsibility
for
such
reduction
but
the
congress
will
have
to
determine
which
activities
are
to
be
reduced
certain
expenditures
we
cannot
possibly
reduce
at
this
session
such
as
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
a
few
million
dollars
saved
here
or
there
in
the
normal
or
in
curtailed
work
of
the
old
departments
and
commissions
will
make
no
great
saving
in
the
federal
budget
therefore
the
congress
would
have
to
reduce
drastically
some
of
certain
large
items
very
large
items
such
as
aids
to
agriculture
and
soil
conservation
veterans
pensions
flood
control
highways
waterways
and
other
public
works
grants
for
social
and
health
security
civilian
conservation
corps
activities
relief
for
the
unemployed
or
national
defense
itself
the
congress
alone
has
the
power
to
do
all
this
as
it
is
the
appropriating
branch
of
the
government
the
other
approach
to
the
question
of
government
spending
takes
the
position
that
this
nation
ought
not
to
be
and
need
not
be
only
a
sixty
billion
dollar
nation
that
at
this
moment
it
has
the
men
and
the
resources
sufficient
to
make
it
at
least
an
eighty
billion
dollar
nation
this
school
of
thought
does
not
believe
that
it
can
become
an
eighty
billion
dollar
nation
in
the
near
future
if
government
cuts
its
operations
by
onethird
it
is
convinced
that
if
we
were
to
try
it
we
would
invite
disasterand
that
we
would
not
long
remain
even
a
sixty
billion
dollar
nation
there
are
many
complicated
factors
with
which
we
have
to
deal
but
we
have
learned
that
it
is
unsafe
to
make
abrupt
reductions
at
any
time
in
our
net
expenditure
program
by
our
common
sense
action
of
resuming
government
activities
last
spring
we
have
reversed
a
recession
and
started
the
new
rising
tide
of
prosperity
and
national
income
which
we
are
now
just
beginning
to
enjoy
if
government
activities
are
fully
maintained
there
is
a
good
prospect
of
our
becoming
an
eighty
billion
dollar
country
in
a
very
short
time
with
such
a
national
income
present
tax
laws
will
yield
enough
each
year
to
balance
each
years
expenses
it
is
my
conviction
that
down
in
their
hearts
the
american
publicindustry
agriculture
financewant
this
congress
to
do
whatever
needs
to
be
done
to
raise
our
national
income
to
eighty
billion
dollars
a
year
investing
soundly
must
preclude
spending
wastefully
to
guard
against
opportunist
appropriations
i
have
on
several
occasions
addressed
the
congress
on
the
importance
of
permanent
longrange
planning
i
hope
therefore
that
following
my
recommendation
of
last
year
a
permanent
agency
will
be
set
up
and
authorized
to
report
on
the
urgency
and
desirability
of
the
various
types
of
government
investment
investment
for
prosperity

can
be
made
in
a
democracy
i
hear
some
people
say
this
is
all
so
complicated
there
are
certain
advantages
in
a
dictatorship
it
gets
rid
of
labor
trouble
of
unemployment
of
wasted
motion
and
of
having
to
do
your
own
thinking
my
answer
is
yes
but
it
also
gets
rid
of
some
other
things
which
we
americans
intend
very
definitely
to
keepand
we
still
intend
to
do
our
own
thinking
it
will
cost
us
taxes
and
the
voluntary
risk
of
capital
to
attain
some
of
the
practical
advantages
which
other
forms
of
government
have
acquired
dictatorship
however
involves
costs
which
the
american
people
will
never
pay
the
cost
of
our
spiritual
values
the
cost
of
the
blessed
right
of
being
able
to
say
what
we
please
the
cost
of
freedom
of
religion
the
cost
of
seeing
our
capital
confiscated
the
cost
of
being
cast
into
a
concentration
camp
the
cost
of
being
afraid
to
walk
down
the
street
with
the
wrong
neighbor
the
cost
of
having
our
children
brought
up
not
as
free
and
dignified
human
beings
but
as
pawns
molded
and
enslaved
by
a
machine
if
the
avoidance
of
these
costs
means
taxes
on
my
income
if
avoiding
these
costs
means
taxes
on
my
estate
at
death
i
would
bear
those
taxes
willingly
as
the
price
of
my
breathing
and
my
children
breathing
the
free
air
of
a
free
country
as
the
price
of
a
living
and
not
a
dead
world
events
abroad
have
made
it
increasingly
clear
to
the
american
people
that
dangers
within
are
less
to
be
feared
than
dangers
from
without
if
therefore
a
solution
of
this
problem
of
idle
men
and
idle
capital
is
the
price
of
preserving
our
liberty
no
formless
selfish
fears
can
stand
in
the
way
once
i
prophesied
that
this
generation
of
americans
had
a
rendezvous
with
destiny
that
prophecy
comes
true
to
us
much
is
given
more
is
expected
this
generation
will
nobly
save
or
meanly
lose
the
last
best
hope
of
earth
the
way
is
plain
peaceful
generous
justa
way
which
if
followed
the
world
will
forever
applaud
and
god
must
forever
bless

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
addressing
the
congress
on
the
state
of
the
union
present
facts
and
future
hazards
demand
that
i
speak
clearly
and
earnestly
of
the
causes
which
underlie
events
of
profound
concern
to
all
in
spite
of
the
determination
of
this
nation
for
peace
it
has
become
clear
that
acts
and
policies
of
nations
in
other
parts
of
the
world
have
farreaching
effects
not
only
upon
their
immediate
neighbors
but
also
on
us
i
am
thankful
that
i
can
tell
you
that
our
nation
is
at
peace
it
has
been
kept
at
peace
despite
provocations
which
in
other
days
because
of
their
seriousness
could
well
have
engendered
war
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
have
shown
capacity
for
restraint
and
a
civilized
approach
to
the
purposes
of
peace
while
at
the
same
time
we
maintain
the
integrity
inherent
in
the
sovereignty
of
people
lest
we
weaken
or
destroy
our
influence
for
peace
and
jeopardize
the
sovereignty
itself
it
is
our
traditional
policy
to
live
at
peace
with
other
nations
more
than
that
we
have
been
among
the
leaders
in
advocating
the
use
of
pacific
methods
of
discussion
and
conciliation
in
international
differences
we
have
striven
for
the
reduction
of
military
forces
but
in
a
world
of
high
tension
and
disorder
in
a
world
where
stable
civilization
is
actually
threatened
it
becomes
the
responsibility
of
each
nation
which
strives
for
peace
at
home
and
peace
with
and
among
others
to
be
strong
enough
to
assure
the
observance
of
those
fundamentals
of
peaceful
solution
of
conflicts
which
are
the
only
ultimate
basis
for
orderly
existence
resolute
in
our
determination
to
respect
the
rights
of
others
and
to
command
respect
for
the
rights
of
ourselves
we
must
keep
ourselves
adequately
strong
in
selfdefense
there
is
a
trend
in
the
world
away
from
the
observance
both
of
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
treaties
we
propose
to
observe
as
we
have
in
the
past
our
own
treaty
obligations
to
the
limit
but
we
cannot
be
certain
of
reciprocity
on
the
part
of
others
disregard
for
treaty
obligations
seems
to
have
followed
the
surface
trend
away
from
the
democratic
representative
form
of
government
it
would
seem
therefore
that
world
peace
through
international
agreements
is
most
safe
in
the
hands
of
democratic
representative
governmentsor
in
other
words
peace
is
most
greatly
jeopardized
in
and
by
those
nations
where
democracy
has
been
discarded
or
has
never
developed
i
have
used
the
words
surface
trend
for
i
still
believe
that
civilized
man
increasingly
insists
and
in
the
long
run
will
insist
on
genuine
participation
in
his
own
government
our
people
believe
that
over
the
years
democracies
of
the
world
will
survive
and
that
democracy
will
be
restored
or
established
in
those
nations
which
today
know
it
not
in
that
faith
lies
the
future
peace
of
mankind
at
home
conditions
call
for
my
equal
candor
events
of
recent
months
are
new
proof
that
we
cannot
conduct
a
national
government
after
the
practice
of
or
or
for
the
obvious
reason
that
human
needs
and
human
desires
are
infinitely
greater
infinitely
more
difficult
to
meet
than
in
any
previous
period
in
the
life
of
our
republic
hitherto
it
has
been
an
acknowledged
duty
of
government
to
meet
these
desires
and
needs
nothing
has
occurred
of
late
to
absolve
the
congress
the
courts
or
the
president
from
that
task
it
faces
us
as
squarely
as
insistently
as
in
march
much
of
trouble
in
our
own
lifetime
has
sprung
from
a
long
period
of
inactionfrom
ignoring
what
fundamentally
was
happening
to
us
and
from
a
timeserving
unwillingness
to
face
facts
as
they
forced
themselves
upon
us
our
national
life
rests
on
two
nearly
equal
producing
forces
agriculture
and
industry
each
employing
about
onethird
of
our
citizens
the
other
third
transports
and
distributes
the
products
of
the
first
two
or
performs
special
services
for
the
whole
the
first
great
force
agricultureand
with
it
the
production
of
timber
minerals
and
other
natural
resourceswent
forward
feverishly
and
thoughtlessly
until
nature
rebelled
and
we
saw
deserts
encroach
floods
destroy
trees
disappear
and
soil
exhausted
at
the
same
time
we
have
been
discovering
that
vast
numbers
of
our
farming
population
live
in
a
poverty
more
abject
than
that
of
many
of
the
farmers
of
europe
whom
we
are
wont
to
call
peasants
that
the
prices
of
our
products
of
agriculture
are
too
often
dependent
on
speculation
by
nonfarming
groups
and
that
foreign
nations
eager
to
become
selfsustaining
or
ready
to
put
virgin
land
under
the
plough
are
no
longer
buying
our
surpluses
of
cotton
and
wheat
and
lard
and
tobacco
and
fruit
as
they
had
before
since
we
have
knowingly
faced
a
choice
of
three
remedies
first
to
cut
our
cost
of
farm
production
below
that
of
other
nationsan
obvious
impossibility
in
many
crops
today
unless
we
revert
to
human
slavery
or
its
equivalent
second
to
make
the
government
the
guarantor
of
farm
prices
and
the
underwriter
of
excess
farm
production
without
limita
course
which
would
bankrupt
the
strongest
government
in
the
world
in
a
decade
third
to
place
the
primary
responsibility
directly
on
the
farmers
themselves
under
the
principle
of
majority
rule
so
that
they
may
decide
with
full
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
surpluses
scarcities
world
markets
and
domestic
needs
what
the
planting
of
each
crop
should
be
in
order
to
maintain
a
reasonably
adequate
supply
which
will
assure
a
minimum
adequate
price
under
the
normal
processes
of
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
that
means
adequacy
of
supply
but
not
glut
it
means
adequate
reserves
against
the
day
of
drought
it
is
shameless
misrepresentation
to
call
this
a
policy
of
scarcity
it
is
in
truth
insurance
before
the
fact
instead
of
government
subsidy
after
the
fact
any
such
plan
for
the
control
of
excessive
surpluses
and
the
speculation
they
bring
has
two
enemies
there
are
those
well
meaning
theorists
who
harp
on
the
inherent
right
of
every
free
born
american
to
do
with
his
land
what
he
wantsto
cultivate
it
wellor
badly
to
conserve
his
timber
by
cutting
only
the
annual
increment
thereofor
to
strip
it
clean
let
fire
burn
the
slash
and
erosion
complete
the
ruin
to
raise
only
one
cropand
if
that
crop
fails
to
look
for
food
and
support
from
his
neighbors
or
his
government
that
i
assert
is
not
an
inherent
right
of
citizenship
for
if
a
man
farms
his
land
to
the
waste
of
the
soil
or
the
trees
he
destroys
not
only
his
own
assets
but
the
nations
assets
as
well
or
if
by
his
methods
he
makes
himself
year
after
year
a
financial
hazard
of
the
community
and
the
government
he
becomes
not
only
a
social
problem
but
an
economic
menace
the
day
has
gone
by
when
it
could
be
claimed
that
government
has
no
interest
in
such
illconsidered
practices
and
no
right
through
representative
methods
to
stop
them
the
other
group
of
enemies
is
perhaps
less
wellmeaning
it
includes
those
who
for
partisan
purposes
oppose
each
and
every
practical
effort
to
help
the
situation
and
also
those
who
make
money
from
undue
fluctuations
in
crop
prices
i
gladly
note
that
measures
which
seek
to
initiate
a
government
program
for
a
balanced
agriculture
are
now
in
conference
between
the
two
houses
of
the
congress
in
their
final
consideration
i
hope
for
a
sound
consistent
measure
which
will
keep
the
cost
of
its
administration
within
the
figure
of
current
government
expenditures
in
aid
of
agriculture
the
farmers
of
this
nation
know
that
a
balanced
output
can
be
put
into
effect
without
excessive
cost
and
with
the
cooperation
of
the
great
majority
of
them
if
this
balance
can
be
created
by
an
allweather
farm
program
our
farm
population
will
soon
be
assured
of
relatively
constant
purchasing
power
from
this
will
flow
two
other
practical
results
the
consuming
public
will
be
protected
against
excessive
food
and
textile
prices
and
the
industries
of
the
nation
and
their
workers
will
find
a
steadier
demand
for
wares
sold
to
the
agricultural
third
of
our
people
to
raise
the
purchasing
power
of
the
farmer
is
however
not
enough
it
will
not
stay
raised
if
we
do
not
also
raise
the
purchasing
power
of
that
third
of
the
nation
which
receives
its
income
from
industrial
employment
millions
of
industrial
workers
receive
pay
so
low
that
they
have
little
buying
power
aside
from
the
undoubted
fact
that
they
thereby
suffer
great
human
hardship
they
are
unable
to
buy
adequate
food
and
shelter
to
maintain
health
or
to
buy
their
share
of
manufactured
goods
we
have
not
only
seen
minimum
wage
and
maximum
hour
provisions
prove
their
worth
economically
and
socially
under
government
auspices
in
and
but
the
people
of
this
country
by
an
overwhelming
vote
are
in
favor
of
having
the
congressthis
congressput
a
floor
below
which
industrial
wages
shall
not
fall
and
a
ceiling
beyond
which
the
hours
of
industrial
labor
shall
not
rise
here
again
let
us
analyze
the
opposition
a
part
of
it
is
sincere
in
believing
that
an
effort
thus
to
raise
the
purchasing
power
of
lowest
paid
industrial
workers
is
not
the
business
of
the
federal
government
others
give
lip
service
to
a
general
objective
but
do
not
like
any
specific
measure
that
is
proposed
in
both
cases
it
is
worth
our
while
to
wonder
whether
some
of
these
opponents
are
not
at
heart
opposed
to
any
program
for
raising
the
wages
of
the
underpaid
or
reducing
the
hours
of
the
overworked
another
group
opposes
legislation
of
this
type
on
the
ground
that
cheap
labor
will
help
their
locality
to
acquire
industries
and
outside
capital
or
to
retain
industries
which
today
are
surviving
only
because
of
existing
low
wages
and
long
hours
it
has
been
my
thought
that
especially
during
these
past
five
years
this
nation
has
grown
away
from
local
or
sectional
selfishness
and
toward
national
patriotism
and
unity
i
am
disappointed
by
some
recent
actions
and
by
some
recent
utterances
which
sound
like
the
philosophy
of
half
a
century
ago
there
are
many
communities
in
the
united
states
where
the
average
family
income
is
pitifully
low
it
is
in
those
communities
that
we
find
the
poorest
educational
facilities
and
the
worst
c
onditions
of
health
why
it
is
not
because
they
are
satisfied
to
live
as
they
do
it
is
because
those
communities
have
the
lowest
per
capita
wealth
and
income
therefore
the
lowest
ability
to
pay
taxes
and
therefore
inadequate
functioning
of
local
government
such
communities
exist
in
the
east
in
the
middle
west
in
the
far
west
and
in
the
south
those
who
represent
such
areas
in
every
part
of
the
country
do
their
constituents
ill
service
by
blocking
efforts
to
raise
their
incomes
their
property
values
and
therefore
their
whole
scale
of
living
in
the
long
run
the
profits
from
child
labor
low
pay
and
overwork
enure
not
to
the
locality
or
region
where
they
exist
but
to
the
absentee
owners
who
have
sent
their
capital
into
these
exploited
communities
to
gather
larger
profits
for
themselves
indeed
new
enterprises
and
new
industries
which
bring
permanent
wealth
will
come
more
readily
to
those
communities
which
insist
on
good
pay
and
reasonable
hours
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
they
will
find
a
greater
industrial
efficiency
and
happier
workers
no
reasonable
person
seeks
a
complete
uniformity
in
wages
in
every
part
of
the
united
states
nor
does
any
reasonable
person
seek
an
immediate
and
drastic
change
from
the
lowest
pay
to
the
highest
pay
we
are
seeking
of
course
only
legislation
to
end
starvation
wages
and
intolerable
hours
more
desirable
wages
are
and
should
continue
to
be
the
product
of
collective
bargaining
many
of
those
who
represent
great
cities
have
shown
their
understanding
of
the
necessity
of
helping
the
agricultural
third
of
the
nation
i
hope
that
those
who
represent
constituencies
primarily
agricultural
will
not
underestimate
the
importance
of
extending
like
aid
to
the
industrial
third
wage
and
hour
legislation
therefore
is
a
problem
which
is
definitely
before
this
congress
for
action
it
is
an
essential
part
of
economic
recovery
it
has
the
support
of
an
overwhelming
majority
of
our
people
in
every
walk
of
life
they
have
expressed
themselves
through
the
ballot
box
again
i
revert
to
the
increase
of
national
purchasing
power
as
an
underlying
necessity
of
the
day
if
you
increase
that
purchasing
power
for
the
farmers
and
for
the
industrial
workers
especially
for
those
in
both
groups
who
have
least
of
it
today
you
will
increase
the
purchasing
power
of
the
final
third
of
our
populationthose
who
transport
and
distribute
the
products
of
farm
and
factory
and
those
of
the
professions
who
serve
all
groups
i
have
tried
to
make
clear
to
you
and
through
you
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
this
is
an
urgency
which
must
be
met
by
complete
and
not
by
partial
action
if
it
is
met
if
the
purchasing
power
of
the
nation
as
a
wholein
other
words
the
total
of
the
nations
incomecan
be
still
further
increased
other
happy
results
will
flow
from
such
increase
we
have
raised
the
nations
income
from
thirtyeight
billion
dollars
in
the
year
to
about
sixtyeight
billion
dollars
in
the
year
our
goal
our
objective
is
to
raise
it
to
ninety
or
one
hundred
billion
dollars
we
have
heard
much
about
a
balanced
budget
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
many
of
those
who
have
pleaded
for
a
balanced
budget
as
the
sole
need
now
come
to
me
to
plead
for
additional
government
expenditures
at
the
expense
of
unbalancing
the
budget
as
the
congress
is
fully
aware
the
annual
deficit
large
for
several
years
has
been
declining
the
last
fiscal
year
and
this
the
proposed
budget
for
which
i
shall
shortly
send
to
the
congress
will
exhibit
a
further
decrease
in
the
deficit
though
not
a
balance
between
income
and
outgo
to
many
who
have
pleaded
with
me
for
an
immediate
balancing
of
the
budget
by
a
sharp
curtailment
or
even
elimination
of
government
functions
i
have
asked
the
question
what
present
expenditures
would
you
reduce
or
eliminate
and
the
invariable
answer
has
been
that
is
not
my
businessi
know
nothing
of
the
details
but
i
am
sure
that
it
could
be
done
that
is
not
what
you
or
i
would
call
helpful
citizenship
on
only
one
point
do
most
of
them
have
a
suggestion
they
think
that
relief
for
the
unemployed
by
the
giving
of
work
is
wasteful
and
when
i
pin
them
down
i
discover
that
at
heart
they
are
actually
in
favor
of
substituting
a
dole
in
place
of
useful
work
to
that
neither
i
nor
i
am
confident
the
senators
and
representatives
in
the
congress
will
ever
consent
i
am
as
anxious
as
any
banker
or
industrialist
or
business
man
or
investor
or
economist
that
the
budget
of
the
united
states
government
be
brought
into
balance
as
quickly
as
possible
but
i
lay
down
certain
conditions
which
seem
reasonable
and
which
i
believe
all
should
accept
the
first
condition
is
that
we
continue
the
policy
of
not
permitting
any
needy
american
who
can
and
is
willing
to
work
to
starve
because
the
federal
government
does
not
provide
the
work
the
second
is
that
the
congress
and
the
executive
join
hands
in
eliminating
or
curtailing
any
federal
activity
which
can
be
eliminated
or
curtailed
or
even
postponed
without
harming
necessary
government
functions
or
the
safety
of
the
nation
from
a
national
point
of
view
the
third
is
to
raise
the
purchasing
power
of
the
nation
to
the
point
that
the
taxes
on
this
purchasing
poweror
in
other
words
on
the
nations
incomewill
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
necessary
expenditures
of
the
national
government
i
have
hitherto
stated
that
in
my
judgment
the
expenditures
of
the
national
government
cannot
be
cut
much
below
seven
billion
dollars
a
year
without
destroying
essential
functions
or
letting
people
starve
that
sum
can
be
raised
and
will
be
cheerfully
provided
by
the
american
people
if
we
can
increase
the
nations
income
to
a
point
well
beyond
the
present
level
this
does
not
mean
that
as
the
nations
income
goes
up
the
federal
expenditures
should
rise
in
proportion
on
the
contrary
the
congress
and
the
executive
should
use
every
effort
to
hold
the
normal
federal
expenditures
to
approximately
the
present
level
thus
making
it
possible
with
an
increase
in
the
nations
income
and
the
resulting
increase
in
tax
receipts
not
only
to
balance
future
budgets
but
to
reduce
the
debt
in
line
with
this
policy
fall
my
former
recommendations
for
the
reorganization
and
improvement
of
the
administrative
structure
of
the
government
both
for
immediate
executive
needs
and
for
the
planning
of
future
national
needs
i
renew
those
recommendations
in
relation
to
tax
changes
three
things
should
be
kept
in
mind
first
the
total
sum
to
be
derived
by
the
federal
treasury
must
not
be
decreased
as
a
result
of
any
changes
in
schedules
second
abuses
by
individuals
or
corporations
designed
to
escape
taxpaying
by
using
various
methods
of
doing
business
corporate
and
otherwiseabuses
which
we
have
sought
with
great
success
to
endmust
not
be
restored
third
we
should
rightly
change
certain
provisions
where
they
are
proven
to
work
definite
hardship
especially
on
the
small
business
men
of
the
nation
but
speculative
income
should
not
be
favored
over
earned
income
it
is
human
nature
to
argue
that
this
or
that
tax
is
responsible
for
every
ill
it
is
human
nature
on
the
part
of
those
who
pay
graduated
taxes
to
attack
all
taxes
based
on
the
principle
of
ability
to
pay
these
are
the
same
complainants
who
for
a
generation
blocked
the
imposition
of
a
graduated
income
tax
they
are
the
same
complainants
who
would
impose
the
type
of
flat
sales
tax
which
places
the
burden
of
government
more
on
those
least
able
to
pay
and
less
on
those
most
able
to
pay
our
conclusion
must
be
that
while
proven
hardships
should
be
corrected
they
should
not
be
corrected
in
such
a
way
as
to
restore
abuses
already
terminated
or
to
shift
a
greater
burden
to
the
less
fortunate
this
subject
leads
naturally
into
the
wider
field
of
the
public
attitude
toward
business
the
objective
of
increasing
the
purchasing
power
of
the
farming
third
the
industrial
third
and
the
service
third
of
our
population
presupposes
the
cooperation
of
what
we
call
capital
and
labor
capital
is
essential
reasonable
earnings
on
capital
are
essential
but
misuse
of
the
powers
of
capital
or
selfish
suspension
of
the
employment
of
capital
must
be
ended
or
the
capitalistic
system
will
destroy
itself
through
its
own
abuses
the
overwhelming
majority
of
business
men
and
bankers
intend
to
be
good
citizens
only
a
small
minority
have
displayed
poor
citizenship
by
engaging
in
practices
which
are
dishonest
or
definitely
harmful
to
society
this
statement
is
straightforward
and
true
no
person
in
any
responsible
place
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
today
has
ever
taken
any
position
contrary
to
it
but
unfortunately
for
the
country
when
attention
is
called
to
or
attack
is
made
on
specific
misuses
of
capital
there
has
been
a
deliberate
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
condemned
minority
to
distort
the
criticism
into
an
attack
on
all
capital
that
is
wilful
deception
but
it
does
not
long
deceive
if
attention
is
called
to
or
attack
made
on
certain
wrongful
business
practices
there
are
those
who
are
eager
to
call
it
an
attack
on
all
business
that
too
is
wilful
deception
that
will
not
long
deceive
let
us
consider
certain
facts
there
are
practices
today
which
most
people
believe
should
be
ended
they
include
tax
avoidance
through
corporate
and
other
methods
which
i
have
previously
mentioned
excessive
capitalization
investment
writeups
and
security
manipulations
price
rigging
and
collusive
bidding
in
defiance
of
the
spirit
of
the
antitrust
laws
by
methods
which
baffle
prosecution
under
the
present
statutes
they
include
highpressure
salesmanship
which
creates
cycles
of
overproduction
within
given
industries
and
consequent
recessions
in
production
until
such
time
as
the
surplus
is
consumed
the
use
of
patent
laws
to
enable
larger
corporations
to
maintain
high
prices
and
withhold
from
the
public
the
advantages
of
the
progress
of
science
unfair
competition
which
drives
the
smaller
producer
out
of
business
locally
regionally
or
even
on
a
national
scale
intimidation
of
local
or
state
government
to
prevent
the
enactment
of
laws
for
the
protection
of
labor
by
threatening
to
move
elsewhere
the
shifting
o
f
actual
production
from
one
locality
or
region
to
another
in
pursuit
of
the
cheapest
wage
scale
the
enumeration
of
these
abuses
does
not
mean
that
business
as
a
whole
is
guilty
of
them
again
it
is
deception
that
will
not
long
deceive
to
tell
the
country
that
an
attack
on
these
abuses
is
an
attack
on
business
another
group
of
problems
affecting
business
which
cannot
be
termed
specific
abuses
gives
us
food
for
grave
thought
about
the
future
generically
such
problems
arise
out
of
the
concentration
of
economic
control
to
the
detriment
of
the
body
politiccontrol
of
other
peoples
money
other
peoples
labor
other
peoples
lives
in
many
instances
such
concentrations
cannot
be
justified
on
the
ground
of
operating
efficiency
but
have
been
created
for
the
sake
of
securities
profits
financial
control
the
suppression
of
competition
and
the
ambition
for
power
over
others
in
some
lines
of
industry
a
very
small
numerical
group
is
in
such
a
position
of
influence
that
its
actions
are
of
necessity
followed
by
the
other
units
operating
in
the
same
field
that
such
influences
operate
to
control
banking
and
finance
is
equally
true
in
spite
of
the
many
efforts
through
federal
legislation
to
take
such
control
out
of
the
hands
of
a
small
group
we
have
but
to
talk
with
hundreds
of
small
bankers
throughout
the
united
states
to
realize
that
irrespective
of
local
conditions
they
are
compelled
in
practice
to
accept
the
policies
laid
down
by
a
small
number
of
the
larger
banks
in
the
nation
the
work
undertaken
by
andrew
jackson
and
woodrow
wilson
is
not
finished
yet
the
ownership
of
vast
properties
or
the
organization
of
thousands
of
workers
creates
a
heavy
obligation
of
public
service
the
power
should
not
be
sought
or
sanctioned
unless
the
responsibility
is
accepted
as
well
the
man
who
seeks
freedom
from
such
responsibility
in
the
name
of
individual
liberty
is
either
fooling
himself
or
trying
to
cheat
his
fellow
men
he
wants
to
eat
the
fruits
of
orderly
society
without
paying
for
them
as
a
nation
we
have
rejected
any
radical
revolutionary
program
for
a
permanent
correction
of
grave
weaknesses
in
our
economic
system
we
have
relied
on
new
applications
of
old
democratic
processes
it
is
not
necessary
to
recount
what
has
been
accomplished
in
preserving
the
homes
and
livelihood
of
millions
of
workers
on
farms
and
in
cities
in
reconstructing
a
sound
banking
and
credit
system
in
reviving
trade
and
industry
in
reestablishing
security
of
life
and
property
all
we
need
today
is
to
look
upon
the
fundamental
sound
economic
conditions
to
know
that
this
business
recession
causes
more
perplexity
than
fear
on
the
part
of
most
people
and
to
contrast
our
prevailing
mental
attitude
with
the
terror
and
despair
of
five
years
ago
furthermore
we
have
a
new
moral
climate
in
america
that
means
that
we
ask
business
and
finance
to
recognize
that
fact
to
cure
such
inequalities
as
they
can
cure
without
legislation
but
to
join
their
government
in
the
enactment
of
legislation
where
the
ending
of
abuses
and
the
steady
functioning
of
our
economic
system
calls
for
government
assistance
the
nation
has
no
obligation
to
make
america
safe
either
for
incompetent
business
men
or
for
business
men
who
fail
to
note
the
trend
of
the
times
and
continue
the
use
of
machinery
of
economics
and
practices
of
finance
as
outworn
as
the
cotton
spindle
of
government
can
be
expected
to
cooperate
in
every
way
with
the
business
of
the
nation
provided
the
component
parts
of
business
abandon
practices
which
do
not
belong
to
this
day
and
age
and
adopt
price
and
production
policies
appropriate
to
the
times
in
regard
to
the
relationship
of
government
to
certain
processes
of
business
to
which
i
have
referred
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
existing
laws
undoubtedly
require
reconstruction
i
expect
therefore
to
address
the
congress
in
a
special
message
on
this
subject
and
i
hope
to
have
the
help
of
business
in
the
efforts
of
government
to
help
business
i
have
spoken
of
labor
as
another
essential
in
the
three
great
groups
of
the
population
in
raising
the
nations
income
definite
strides
in
collective
bargaining
have
been
made
and
the
right
of
labor
to
organize
has
been
nationally
accepted
nevertheless
in
the
evolution
of
the
process
difficult
situations
have
arisen
in
localities
and
among
groups
unfortunate
divisions
relating
to
jurisdiction
among
the
workers
themselves
have
retarded
production
within
given
industries
and
have
therefore
affected
related
industries
the
construction
of
homes
and
other
buildings
has
been
hindered
in
some
localities
not
only
by
unnecessarily
high
prices
for
materials
but
also
by
certain
hourly
wage
scales
for
economic
and
social
reasons
our
principal
interest
for
the
near
future
lies
along
two
lines
first
the
immediate
desirability
of
increasing
the
wages
of
the
lowest
paid
groups
in
all
industry
and
second
in
thinking
in
terms
of
regularizing
the
work
of
the
individual
worker
more
greatly
through
the
yearin
other
words
in
thinking
more
in
terms
of
the
workers
total
pay
for
a
period
of
a
whole
year
rather
than
in
terms
of
his
remuneration
by
the
hour
or
by
the
day
in
the
case
of
labor
as
in
the
case
of
capital
misrepresentation
of
the
policy
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
deception
which
will
not
long
deceive
in
both
cases
we
seek
cooperation
in
every
case
power
and
responsibility
must
go
hand
in
hand
i
have
spoken
of
economic
causes
which
throw
the
nations
income
out
of
balance
i
have
spoken
of
practices
and
abuses
which
demand
correction
through
the
cooperation
of
capital
and
labor
with
the
government
but
no
government
can
help
the
destinies
of
people
who
insist
in
putting
sectional
and
class
consciousness
ahead
of
general
weal
there
must
be
proof
that
sectional
and
class
interests
are
prepared
more
greatly
than
they
are
today
to
be
national
in
outlook
a
government
can
punish
specific
acts
of
spoliation
but
no
government
can
conscript
cooperation
we
have
improved
some
matters
by
way
of
remedial
legislation
but
where
in
some
particulars
that
legislation
has
failed
we
cannot
be
sure
whether
it
fails
because
some
of
its
details
are
unwise
or
because
it
is
being
sabotaged
at
any
rate
we
hold
our
objectives
and
our
principles
to
be
sound
we
will
never
go
back
on
them
government
has
a
final
responsibility
for
the
wellbeing
of
its
citizenship
if
private
cooperative
endeavor
fails
to
provide
work
for
willing
hands
and
relief
for
the
unfortunate
those
suffering
hardship
from
no
fault
of
their
own
have
a
right
to
call
upon
the
government
for
aid
and
a
government
worthy
of
its
name
must
make
fitting
response
it
is
the
opportunity
and
the
duty
of
all
those
who
have
faith
in
democratic
methods
as
applied
in
industry
in
agriculture
and
in
business
as
well
as
in
the
field
of
politics
to
do
their
utmost
to
cooperate
with
governmentwithout
regard
to
political
affiliation
special
interests
or
economic
prejudicesin
whatever
program
may
be
sanctioned
by
the
chosen
representatives
of
the
people
that
presupposes
on
the
part
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
a
program
its
enactment
and
its
administration
not
because
of
the
pledges
of
party
programs
alone
not
because
of
the
clear
policies
of
the
past
five
years
but
chiefly
because
of
the
need
of
national
unity
in
ending
mistakes
of
the
past
and
meeting
the
necessities
of
today
we
must
carry
on
i
do
not
propose
to
let
the
people
down
i
am
sure
the
congress
of
the
united
states
will
not
let
the
people
down

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
in
our
national
history
a
president
delivers
his
annual
message
to
a
new
congress
within
a
fortnight
of
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
office
while
there
is
no
change
in
the
presidency
this
year
change
will
occur
in
future
years
it
is
my
belief
that
under
this
new
constitutional
practice
the
president
should
in
every
fourth
year
in
so
far
as
seems
reasonable
review
the
existing
state
of
our
national
affairs
and
outline
broad
future
problems
leaving
specific
recommendations
for
future
legislation
to
be
made
by
the
president
about
to
be
inaugurated
at
this
time
however
circumstances
of
the
moment
compel
me
to
ask
your
immediate
consideration
of
first
measures
extending
the
life
of
certain
authorizations
and
powers
which
under
present
statutes
expire
within
a
few
weeks
second
an
addition
to
the
existing
neutrality
act
to
cover
specific
points
raised
by
the
unfortunate
civil
strife
in
spain
and
third
a
deficiency
appropriation
bill
for
which
i
shall
submit
estimates
this
week
in
march
the
problems
which
faced
our
nation
and
which
only
our
national
government
had
the
resources
to
meet
were
more
serious
even
than
appeared
on
the
surface
it
was
not
only
that
the
visible
mechanism
of
economic
life
had
broken
down
more
disturbing
was
the
fact
that
long
neglect
of
the
needs
of
the
underprivileged
had
brought
too
many
of
our
people
to
the
verge
of
doubt
as
to
the
successful
adaptation
of
our
historic
traditions
to
the
complex
modern
world
in
that
lay
a
challenge
to
our
democratic
form
of
government
itself
ours
was
the
task
to
prove
that
democracy
could
be
made
to
function
in
the
world
of
today
as
effectively
as
in
the
simpler
world
of
a
hundred
years
ago
ours
was
the
task
to
do
more
than
to
argue
a
theory
the
times
required
the
confident
answer
of
performance
to
those
whose
instinctive
faith
in
humanity
made
them
want
to
believe
that
in
the
long
run
democracy
would
prove
superior
to
more
extreme
forms
of
government
as
a
process
of
getting
action
when
action
was
wisdom
without
the
spiritual
sacrifices
which
those
other
forms
of
government
exact
that
challenge
we
met
to
meet
it
required
unprecedented
activities
under
federal
leadership
to
end
abuses
to
restore
a
large
measure
of
material
prosperity
to
give
new
faith
to
millions
of
our
citizens
who
had
been
traditionally
taught
to
expect
that
democracy
would
provide
continuously
wider
opportunity
and
continuously
greater
security
in
a
world
where
science
was
continuously
making
material
riches
more
available
to
man
in
the
many
methods
of
attack
with
which
we
met
these
problems
you
and
i
by
mutual
understanding
and
by
determination
to
cooperate
helped
to
make
democracy
succeed
by
refusing
to
permit
unnecessary
disagreement
to
arise
between
two
of
our
branches
of
government
that
spirit
of
cooperation
was
able
to
solve
difficulties
of
extraordinary
magnitude
and
ramification
with
few
important
errors
and
at
a
cost
cheap
when
measured
by
the
immediate
necessities
and
the
eventual
results
i
look
forward
to
a
continuance
of
that
cooperation
in
the
next
four
years
i
look
forward
also
to
a
continuance
of
the
basis
of
that
cooperation
mutual
respect
for
each
others
proper
sphere
of
functioning
in
a
democracy
which
is
working
well
and
a
commonsense
realization
of
the
need
for
play
in
the
joints
of
the
machine
on
that
basis
it
is
within
the
right
of
the
congress
to
determine
which
of
the
many
new
activities
shall
be
continued
or
abandoned
increased
or
curtailed
on
that
same
basis
the
president
alone
has
the
responsibility
for
their
administration
i
find
that
this
task
of
executive
management
has
reached
the
point
where
our
administrative
machinery
needs
comprehensive
overhauling
i
shall
therefore
shortly
address
the
congress
more
fully
in
regard
to
modernizing
and
improving
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
that
cooperation
of
the
past
four
years
between
the
congress
and
the
president
has
aimed
at
the
fulfillment
of
a
twofold
policy
first
economic
recovery
through
many
kinds
of
assistance
to
agriculture
industry
and
banking
and
second
deliberate
improvement
in
the
personal
security
and
opportunity
of
the
great
mass
of
our
people
the
recovery
we
sought
was
not
to
be
merely
temporary
it
was
to
be
a
recovery
protected
from
the
causes
of
previous
disasters
with
that
aim
in
viewto
prevent
a
future
similar
crisisyou
and
i
joined
in
a
series
of
enactmentssafe
banking
and
sound
currency
the
guarantee
of
bank
deposits
protection
for
the
investor
in
securities
the
removal
of
the
threat
of
agricultural
surpluses
insistence
on
collective
bargaining
the
outlawing
of
sweat
shops
child
labor
and
unfair
trade
practices
and
the
beginnings
of
security
for
the
aged
and
the
worker
nor
was
the
recovery
we
sought
merely
a
purposeless
whirring
of
machinery
it
is
important
of
course
that
every
man
and
woman
in
the
country
be
able
to
find
work
that
every
factory
run
that
business
and
farming
as
a
whole
earn
profits
but
government
in
a
democratic
nation
does
not
exist
solely
or
even
primarily
for
that
purpose
it
is
not
enough
that
the
wheels
turn
they
must
carry
us
in
the
direction
of
a
greater
satisfaction
in
life
for
the
average
man
the
deeper
purpose
of
democratic
government
is
to
assist
as
many
of
its
citizens
as
possible
especially
those
who
need
it
most
to
improve
their
conditions
of
life
to
retain
all
personal
liberty
which
does
not
adversely
affect
their
neighbors
and
to
pursue
the
happiness
which
comes
with
security
and
an
opportunity
for
recreation
and
culture
even
with
our
present
recovery
we
are
far
from
the
goal
of
that
deeper
purpose
there
are
farreaching
problems
still
with
us
for
which
democracy
must
find
solutions
if
it
is
to
consider
itself
successful
for
example
many
millions
of
americans
still
live
in
habitations
which
not
only
fail
to
provide
the
physical
benefits
of
modern
civilization
but
breed
disease
and
impair
the
health
of
future
generations
the
menace
exists
not
only
in
the
slum
areas
of
the
very
large
cities
but
in
many
smaller
cities
as
well
it
exists
on
tens
of
thousands
of
farms
in
varying
degrees
in
every
part
of
the
country
another
example
is
the
prevalence
of
an
unamerican
type
of
tenant
farming
i
do
not
suggest
that
every
farm
family
has
the
capacity
to
earn
a
satisfactory
living
on
its
own
farm
but
many
thousands
of
tenant
farmers
indeed
most
of
them
with
some
financial
assistance
and
with
some
advice
and
training
can
be
made
selfsupporting
on
land
which
can
eventually
belong
to
them
the
nation
would
be
wise
to
offer
them
that
chance
instead
of
permitting
them
to
go
along
as
they
do
now
year
after
year
with
neither
future
security
as
tenants
nor
hope
of
ownership
of
their
homes
nor
expectation
of
bettering
the
lot
of
their
children
another
national
problem
is
the
intelligent
development
of
our
social
security
system
the
broadening
of
the
services
it
renders
and
practical
improvement
in
its
operation
in
many
nations
where
such
laws
are
in
effect
success
in
meeting
the
expectations
of
the
community
has
come
through
frequent
amendment
of
the
original
statute
and
of
course
the
most
farreaching
and
the
most
inclusive
problem
of
all
is
that
of
unemployment
and
the
lack
of
economic
balance
of
which
unemployment
is
at
once
the
result
and
the
symptom
the
immediate
question
of
adequate
relief
for
the
needy
unemployed
who
are
capable
of
performing
useful
work
i
shall
discuss
with
the
congress
during
the
coming
months
the
broader
task
of
preventing
unemployment
is
a
matter
of
longrange
evolutionary
policy
to
that
we
must
continue
to
give
our
best
thought
and
effort
we
cannot
assume
that
immediate
industrial
and
commercial
activity
which
mitigates
present
pressures
justifies
the
national
government
at
this
time
in
placing
the
unemployment
problem
in
a
filing
cabinet
of
finished
business
fluctuations
in
employment
are
tied
to
all
other
wasteful
fluctuations
in
our
mechanism
of
production
and
distribution
one
of
these
wastes
is
speculation
in
securities
or
commodities
the
larger
the
volume
of
speculation
the
wider
become
the
upward
and
downward
swings
and
the
more
certain
the
result
that
in
the
long
run
there
will
be
more
losses
than
gains
in
the
underlying
wealth
of
the
community
and
as
is
now
well
known
to
all
of
us
the
same
net
loss
to
society
comes
from
reckless
overproduction
and
monopolistic
underproduction
of
natural
and
manufactured
commodities
overproduction
underproduction
and
speculation
are
three
evil
sisters
who
distill
the
troubles
of
unsound
inflation
and
disastrous
deflation
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
nation
to
have
government
help
private
enterprise
to
gain
sound
general
price
levels
and
to
protect
those
levels
from
wide
perilous
fluctuations
we
know
now
that
if
early
in
government
had
taken
the
steps
which
were
taken
two
and
three
years
later
the
depression
would
never
have
reached
the
depths
of
the
beginning
of
sober
second
thought
confirms
most
of
us
in
the
belief
that
the
broad
objectives
of
the
national
recovery
act
were
sound
we
know
now
that
its
difficulties
arose
from
the
fact
that
it
tried
to
do
too
much
for
example
it
was
unwise
to
expect
the
same
agency
to
regulate
the
length
of
working
hours
minimum
wages
child
labor
and
collective
bargaining
on
the
one
hand
and
the
complicated
questions
of
unfair
trade
practices
and
business
controls
on
the
other
the
statute
of
nra
has
been
outlawed
the
problems
have
not
they
are
still
with
us
that
decent
conditions
and
adequate
pay
for
labor
and
just
return
for
agriculture
can
be
secured
through
parallel
and
simultaneous
action
by
fortyeight
states
is
a
proven
impossibility
it
is
equally
impossible
to
obtain
curbs
on
monopoly
unfair
trade
practices
and
speculation
by
state
action
alone
there
are
those
who
sincerely
or
insincerely
still
cling
to
state
action
as
a
theoretical
hope
but
experience
with
actualities
makes
it
clear
that
federal
laws
supplementing
state
laws
are
needed
to
help
solve
the
problems
which
result
from
modern
i
nvention
applied
in
an
industrialized
nation
which
conducts
its
business
with
scant
regard
to
state
lines
during
the
past
year
there
has
been
a
growing
belief
that
there
is
little
fault
to
be
found
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
it
stands
today
the
vital
need
is
not
an
alteration
of
our
fundamental
law
but
an
increasingly
enlightened
view
with
reference
to
it
difficulties
have
grown
out
of
its
interpretation
but
rightly
considered
it
can
be
used
as
an
instrument
of
progress
and
not
as
a
device
for
prevention
of
action
it
is
worth
our
while
to
read
and
reread
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
and
article
i
thereof
which
confers
the
legislative
powers
upon
the
congress
of
the
united
states
it
is
also
worth
our
while
to
read
again
the
debates
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
from
such
reading
i
obtain
the
very
definite
thought
that
the
members
of
that
convention
were
fully
aware
that
civilization
would
raise
problems
for
the
proposed
new
federal
government
which
they
themselves
could
not
even
surmise
and
that
it
was
their
definite
intent
and
expectation
that
a
liberal
interpretation
in
the
years
to
come
would
give
to
the
congress
the
same
relative
powers
over
new
national
problems
as
they
themselves
gave
to
the
congress
over
the
national
problems
of
their
day
in
presenting
to
the
convention
the
first
basic
draft
of
the
constitution
edmund
randolph
explained
that
it
was
the
purpose
to
insert
essential
principles
only
lest
the
operation
of
government
should
be
clogged
by
rendering
those
provisions
permanent
and
unalterable
which
ought
to
be
accommodated
to
times
and
events
with
a
better
understanding
of
our
purposes
and
a
more
intelligent
recognition
of
our
needs
as
a
nation
it
is
not
to
be
assumed
that
there
will
be
prolonged
failure
to
bring
legislative
and
judicial
action
into
closer
harmony
means
must
be
found
to
adapt
our
legal
forms
and
our
judicial
interpretation
to
the
actual
present
national
needs
of
the
largest
progressive
democracy
in
the
modern
world
that
thought
leads
to
a
consideration
of
world
problems
to
go
no
further
back
than
the
beginning
of
this
century
men
and
women
everywhere
were
seeking
conditions
of
life
very
different
from
those
which
were
customary
before
modern
invention
and
modern
industry
and
modern
communications
had
come
into
being
the
world
war
for
all
of
its
tragedy
encouraged
these
demands
and
stimulated
action
to
fulfill
these
new
desires
many
national
governments
seemed
unable
adequately
to
respond
and
often
with
the
improvident
assent
of
the
masses
of
the
people
themselves
new
forms
of
government
were
set
up
with
oligarchy
taking
the
place
of
democracy
in
oligarchies
militarism
has
leapt
forward
while
in
those
nations
which
have
retained
democracy
militarism
has
waned
i
have
recently
visited
three
of
our
sister
republics
in
south
america
the
very
cordial
receptions
with
which
i
was
greeted
were
in
tribute
to
democracy
to
me
the
outstanding
observation
of
that
visit
was
that
the
masses
of
the
peoples
of
all
the
americas
are
convinced
that
the
democratic
form
of
government
can
be
made
to
succeed
and
do
not
wish
to
substitute
for
it
any
other
form
of
government
they
believe
that
democracies
are
best
able
to
cope
with
the
changing
problems
of
modern
civilization
within
themselves
and
that
democracies
are
best
able
to
maintain
peace
among
themselves
the
interamerican
conference
operating
on
these
fundamental
principles
of
democracy
did
much
to
assure
peace
in
this
hemisphere
existing
peace
machinery
was
improved
new
instruments
to
maintain
peace
and
eliminate
causes
of
war
were
adopted
wider
protection
of
the
interests
of
the
american
republics
in
the
event
of
war
outside
the
western
hemisphere
was
provided
respect
for
and
observance
of
international
treaties
and
international
law
were
strengthened
principles
of
liberal
trade
policies
as
effective
aids
to
the
maintenance
of
peace
were
reaffirmed
the
intellectual
and
cultural
relationships
among
american
republics
were
broadened
as
a
part
of
the
general
peace
program
in
a
world
unhappily
thinking
in
terms
of
war
the
representatives
of
twentyone
nations
sat
around
a
table
in
an
atmosphere
of
complete
confidence
and
understanding
sincerely
discussing
measures
for
maintaining
peace
here
was
a
great
and
a
permanent
achievement
directly
affecting
the
lives
and
security
of
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
human
beings
who
dwell
in
this
western
hemisphere
here
was
an
example
which
must
have
a
wholesome
effect
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
in
a
very
real
sense
the
conference
in
buenos
aires
sent
forth
a
message
on
behalf
of
all
the
democracies
of
the
world
to
those
nations
which
live
otherwise
because
such
other
governments
are
perhaps
more
spectacular
it
was
high
time
for
democracy
to
assert
itself
because
all
of
us
believe
that
our
democratic
form
of
government
can
cope
adequately
with
modern
problems
as
they
arise
it
is
patriotic
as
well
as
logical
for
us
to
prove
that
we
can
meet
new
national
needs
with
new
laws
consistent
with
an
historic
constitutional
framework
clearly
intended
to
receive
liberal
and
not
narrow
interpretation
the
united
states
of
america
within
itself
must
continue
the
task
of
making
democracy
succeed
in
that
task
the
legislative
branch
of
our
government
will
i
am
confident
continue
to
meet
the
demands
of
democracy
whether
they
relate
to
the
curbing
of
abuses
the
extension
of
help
to
those
who
need
help
or
the
better
balancing
of
our
interdependent
economies
so
too
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
must
move
forward
in
this
task
and
at
the
same
time
provide
better
management
for
administrative
action
of
all
kinds
the
judicial
branch
also
is
asked
by
the
people
to
do
its
part
in
making
democracy
successful
we
do
not
ask
the
courts
to
call
nonexistent
powers
into
being
but
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
conceded
powers
or
those
legitimately
implied
shall
be
made
effective
instruments
for
the
common
good
the
process
of
our
democracy
must
not
be
imperiled
by
the
denial
of
essential
powers
of
free
government
your
task
and
mine
is
not
ending
with
the
end
of
the
depression
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
made
it
clear
that
they
expect
us
to
continue
our
active
efforts
in
behalf
of
their
peaceful
advancement
in
that
spirit
of
endeavor
and
service
i
greet
the
th
congress
at
the
beginning
of
this
auspicious
new
year

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
we
are
about
to
enter
upon
another
year
of
the
responsibility
which
the
electorate
of
the
united
states
has
placed
in
our
hands
having
come
so
far
it
is
fitting
that
we
should
pause
to
survey
the
ground
which
we
have
covered
and
the
path
which
lies
ahead
on
the
fourth
day
of
march
on
the
occasion
of
taking
the
oath
of
office
as
president
of
the
united
states
i
addressed
the
people
of
our
country
need
i
recall
either
the
scene
or
the
national
circumstances
attending
the
occasion
the
crisis
of
that
moment
was
almost
exclusively
a
national
one
in
recognition
of
that
fact
so
obvious
to
the
millions
in
the
streets
and
in
the
homes
of
america
i
devoted
by
far
the
greater
part
of
that
address
to
what
i
called
and
the
nation
called
critical
days
within
our
own
borders
you
will
remember
that
on
that
fourth
of
march
the
world
picture
was
an
image
of
substantial
peace
international
consultation
and
widespread
hope
for
the
bettering
of
relations
between
the
nations
gave
to
all
of
us
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
barriers
to
mutual
confidence
to
increased
trade
and
to
the
peaceful
settlement
of
disputes
could
be
progressively
removed
in
fact
my
only
reference
to
the
field
of
world
policy
in
that
address
was
in
these
words
i
would
dedicate
this
nation
to
the
policy
of
the
good
neighborthe
neighbor
who
resolutely
respects
himself
and
because
he
does
so
respects
the
rights
of
othersa
neighbor
who
respects
his
obligations
and
respects
the
sanctity
of
his
agreements
in
and
with
a
world
of
neighbors
in
the
years
that
have
followed
that
sentiment
has
remained
the
dedication
of
this
nation
among
the
nations
of
the
great
western
hemisphere
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
has
happily
prevailed
at
no
time
in
the
four
and
a
half
centuries
of
modern
civilization
in
the
americas
has
there
existedin
any
year
in
any
decade
in
any
generation
in
all
that
timea
greater
spirit
of
mutual
understanding
of
common
helpfulness
and
of
devotion
to
the
ideals
of
serfgovernment
than
exists
today
in
the
twentyone
american
republics
and
their
neighbor
the
dominion
of
canada
this
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
among
the
americas
is
no
longer
a
hope
no
longer
an
objective
remaining
to
be
accomplished
it
is
a
fact
active
present
pertinent
and
effective
in
this
achievement
every
american
nation
takes
an
understanding
part
there
is
neither
war
nor
rumor
of
war
nor
desire
for
war
the
inhabitants
of
this
vast
area
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
strong
spreading
more
than
eight
thousand
miles
from
the
arctic
to
the
antarctic
believe
in
and
propose
to
follow
the
policy
of
the
good
neighbor
they
wish
with
all
their
heart
that
the
rest
of
the
world
might
do
likewise
the
rest
of
the
worldah
there
is
the
rub
were
i
today
to
deliver
an
inaugural
address
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
could
not
limit
my
comments
on
world
affairs
to
one
paragraph
with
much
regret
i
should
be
compelled
to
devote
the
greater
part
to
world
affairs
since
the
summer
of
that
same
year
of
the
temper
and
the
purposes
of
the
rulers
of
many
of
the
great
populations
in
europe
and
in
asia
have
not
pointed
the
way
either
to
peace
or
to
goodwill
among
men
not
only
have
peace
and
goodwill
among
men
grown
more
remote
in
those
areas
of
the
earth
during
this
period
but
a
point
has
been
reached
where
the
people
of
the
americas
must
take
cognizance
of
growing
illwill
of
marked
trends
toward
aggression
of
increasing
armaments
of
shortening
tempersa
situation
which
has
in
it
many
of
the
elements
that
lead
to
the
tragedy
of
general
war
on
those
other
continents
many
nations
principally
the
smaller
peoples
if
left
to
themselves
would
be
content
with
their
boundaries
and
willing
to
solve
within
themselves
and
in
cooperation
with
their
neighbors
their
individual
problems
both
economic
and
social
the
rulers
of
those
nations
deep
in
their
hearts
follow
these
peaceful
and
reasonable
aspirations
of
their
peoples
these
rulers
must
remain
ever
vigilant
against
the
possibility
today
or
tomorrow
of
invasion
or
attack
by
the
rulers
of
other
peoples
who
fail
to
subscribe
to
the
principles
of
bettering
the
human
race
by
peaceful
means
within
those
other
nationsthose
which
today
must
bear
the
primary
definite
responsibility
for
jeopardizing
world
peacewhat
hope
lies
to
say
the
least
there
are
grounds
for
pessimism
it
is
idle
for
us
or
for
others
to
preach
that
the
masses
of
the
people
who
constitute
those
nations
which
are
dominated
by
the
twin
spirits
of
autocracy
and
aggression
are
out
of
sympathy
with
their
rulers
that
they
are
allowed
no
opportunity
to
express
themselves
that
they
would
change
things
if
they
could
that
unfortunately
is
not
so
clear
it
might
be
true
that
the
masses
of
the
people
in
those
nations
would
change
the
policies
of
their
governments
if
they
could
be
allowed
full
freedom
and
full
access
to
the
processes
of
democratic
government
as
we
understand
them
but
they
do
not
have
that
access
lacking
it
they
follow
blindly
and
fervently
the
lead
of
those
who
seek
autocratic
power
nations
seeking
expansion
seeking
the
rectification
of
injustices
springing
from
former
wars
or
seeking
outlets
for
trade
for
population
or
even
for
their
own
peaceful
contributions
to
the
progress
of
civilization
fail
to
demonstrate
that
patience
necessary
to
attain
reasonable
and
legitimate
objectives
by
peaceful
negotiation
or
by
an
appeal
to
the
finer
instincts
of
world
justice
they
have
therefore
impatiently
reverted
to
the
old
belief
in
the
law
of
the
sword
or
to
the
fantastic
conception
that
they
and
they
alone
are
chosen
to
fulfill
a
mission
and
that
all
the
others
among
the
billion
and
a
half
of
human
beings
in
the
world
must
and
shall
learn
from
and
be
subject
to
them
i
recognize
and
you
will
recognize
that
these
words
which
i
have
chosen
with
deliberation
will
not
prove
popular
in
any
nation
that
chooses
to
fit
this
shoe
to
its
foot
such
sentiments
however
will
find
sympathy
and
understanding
in
those
nations
where
the
people
themselves
are
honestly
desirous
of
peace
but
must
constantly
align
themselves
on
one
side
or
the
other
in
the
kaleidoscopic
jockeying
for
position
which
is
characteristic
of
european
and
asiatic
relations
today
for
the
peaceloving
nations
and
there
are
many
of
them
find
that
their
very
identity
depends
on
their
moving
and
moving
again
on
the
chess
board
of
international
politics
i
suggested
in
the
spring
of
that
or
percent
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
were
content
with
the
territorial
limits
of
their
respective
nations
and
were
willing
further
to
reduce
their
armed
forces
if
every
other
nation
in
the
world
would
agree
to
do
likewise
that
is
equally
true
today
and
it
is
even
more
true
today
that
world
peace
and
world
goodwill
are
blocked
by
only
or
percent
of
the
worlds
population
that
is
why
efforts
to
reduce
armies
have
thus
far
not
only
failed
but
have
been
met
by
vastly
increased
armaments
on
land
and
in
the
air
that
is
why
even
efforts
to
continue
the
existing
limits
on
naval
armaments
into
the
years
to
come
show
such
little
current
success
but
the
policy
of
the
united
states
has
been
clear
and
consistent
we
have
sought
with
earnestness
in
every
possible
way
to
limit
world
armaments
and
to
attain
the
peaceful
solution
of
disputes
among
all
nations
we
have
sought
by
every
legitimate
means
to
exert
our
moral
influence
against
repression
against
intolerance
against
autocracy
and
in
favor
of
freedom
of
expression
equality
before
the
law
religious
tolerance
and
popular
rule
in
the
field
of
commerce
we
have
undertaken
to
encourage
a
more
reasonable
interchange
of
the
worlds
goods
in
the
field
of
international
finance
we
have
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
put
an
end
to
dollar
diplomacy
to
money
grabbing
to
speculation
for
the
benefit
of
the
powerful
and
the
rich
at
the
expense
of
the
small
and
the
poor
as
a
consistent
part
of
a
clear
policy
the
united
states
is
following
a
twofold
neutrality
toward
any
and
all
nations
which
engage
in
wars
that
are
not
of
immediate
concern
to
the
americas
first
we
decline
to
encourage
the
prosecution
of
war
by
permitting
belligerents
to
obtain
arms
ammunition
or
implements
of
war
from
the
united
states
second
we
seek
to
discourage
the
use
by
belligerent
nations
of
any
and
all
american
products
calculated
to
facilitate
the
prosecution
of
a
war
in
quantities
over
and
above
our
normal
exports
of
them
in
time
of
peace
i
trust
that
these
objectives
thus
clearly
and
unequivocally
stated
will
be
carried
forward
by
cooperation
between
this
congress
and
the
president
i
realize
that
i
have
emphasized
to
you
the
gravity
of
the
situation
which
confronts
the
people
of
the
world
this
emphasis
is
justified
because
of
its
importance
to
civilization
and
therefore
to
the
united
states
peace
is
jeopardized
by
the
few
and
not
by
the
many
peace
is
threatened
by
those
who
seek
selfish
power
the
world
has
witnessed
similar
erasas
in
the
days
when
petty
kings
and
feudal
barons
were
changing
the
map
of
europe
every
fortnight
or
when
great
emperors
and
great
kings
were
engaged
in
a
mad
scramble
for
colonial
empire
we
hope
that
we
are
not
again
at
the
threshold
of
such
an
era
but
if
face
it
we
must
then
the
united
states
and
the
rest
of
the
americas
can
play
but
one
role
through
a
wellordered
neutrality
to
do
naught
to
encourage
the
contest
through
adequate
defense
to
save
ourselves
from
embroilment
and
attack
and
through
example
and
all
legitimate
encouragement
and
assistance
to
persuade
other
nations
to
return
to
the
ways
of
peace
and
goodwill
the
evidence
before
us
clearly
proves
that
autocracy
in
world
affairs
endangers
peace
and
that
such
threats
do
not
spring
from
those
nations
devoted
to
the
democratic
ideal
if
this
be
true
in
world
affairs
it
should
have
the
greatest
weight
in
the
determination
of
domestic
policies
within
democratic
nations
the
chief
concern
of
the
people
is
to
prevent
the
continuance
or
the
rise
of
autocratic
institutions
that
beget
slavery
at
home
and
aggression
abroad
within
our

borders
as
in
the
world
at
large
popular
opinion
is
at
war
with
a
powerseeking
minority
that
is
no
new
thing
it
was
fought
out
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
from
time
to
time
since
then
the
battle
has
been
continued
under
thomas
jefferson
andrew
jackson
theodore
roosevelt
and
woodrow
wilson
in
these
latter
years
we
have
witnessed
the
domination
of
government
by
financial
and
industrial
groups
numerically
small
but
politically
dominant
in
the
twelve
years
that
succeeded
the
world
war
the
present
group
of
which
i
speak
is
indeed
numerically
small
and
while
it
exercises
a
large
influence
and
has
much
to
say
in
the
world
of
business
it
does
not
i
am
confident
speak
the
true
sentiments
of
the
less
articulate
but
more
important
elements
that
constitute
real
american
business
in
march
i
appealed
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
a
new
effort
to
restore
power
to
those
to
whom
it
rightfully
belonged
the
response
to
that
appeal
resulted
in
the
writing
of
a
new
chapter
in
the
history
of
popular
government
you
the
members
of
the
legislative
branch
and
i
the
executive
contended
for
and
established
a
new
relationship
between
government
and
people
what
were
the
terms
of
that
new
relationship
they
were
an
appeal
from
the
clamor
of
many
private
and
selfish
interests
yes
an
appeal
from
the
clamor
of
partisan
interest
to
the
ideal
of
the
public
interest
government
became
the
representative
and
the
trustee
of
the
public
interest
our
aim
was
to
build
upon
essentially
democratic
institutions
seeking
all
the
while
the
adjustment
of
burdens
the
help
of
the
needy
the
protection
of
the
weak
the
liberation
of
the
exploited
and
the
genuine
protection
of
the
peoples
property
it
goes
without
saying
that
to
create
such
an
economic
constitutional
order
more
than
a
single
legislative
enactment
was
called
for
we
you
in
the
congress
and
i
as
the
executive
had
to
build
upon
a
broad
base
now
after
thirtyfour
months
of
work
we
contemplate
a
fairly
rounded
whole
we
have
returned
the
control
of
the
federal
government
to
the
city
of
washington
to
be
sure
in
so
doing
we
have
invited
battle
we
have
earned
the
hatred
of
entrenched
greed
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
that
we
faced
made
it
necessary
to
drive
some
people
from
power
and
strictly
to
regulate
others
i
made
that
plain
when
i
took
the
oath
of
office
in
march
i
spoke
of
the
practices
of
the
unscrupulous
moneychangers
who
stood
indicted
in
the
court
of
public
opinion
i
spoke
of
the
rulers
of
the
exchanges
of
mankinds
goods
who
failed
through
their
own
stubbornness
and
their
own
incompetence
i
said
that
they
had
admitted
their
failure
and
had
abdicated
abdicated
yes
in
but
now
with
the
passing
of
danger
they
forget
their
damaging
admissions
and
withdraw
their
abdication
they
seek
the
restoration
of
their
selfish
power
they
offer
to
lead
us
back
round
the
same
old
corner
into
the
same
old
dreary
street
yes
there
are
still
determined
groups
that
are
intent
upon
that
very
thing
rigorously
held
up
to
popular
examination
their
true
character
presents
itself
they
steal
the
livery
of
great
national
constitutional
ideals
to
serve
discredited
special
interests
as
guardians
and
trustees
for
great
groups
of
individual
stockholders
they
wrongfully
seek
to
carry
the
property
and
the
interests
entrusted
to
them
into
the
arena
of
partisan
politics
they
seekthis
minority
in
business
and
industryto
control
and
often
do
control
and
use
for
their
own
purposes
legitimate
and
highly
honored
business
associations
they
engage
in
vast
propaganda
to
spread
fear
and
discord
among
the
peoplethey
would
gang
up
against
the
peoples
liberties
the
principle
that
they
would
instill
into
government
if
they
succeed
in
seizing
power
is
well
shown
by
the
principles
which
many
of
them
have
instilled
into
their
own
affairs
autocracy
toward
labor
toward
stockholders
toward
consumers
toward
public
sentiment
autocrats
in
smaller
things
they
seek
autocracy
in
bigger
things
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
if
these
gentlemen
believe
as
they
say
they
believe
that
the
measures
adopted
by
this
congress
and
its
predecessor
and
carried
out
by
this
administration
have
hindered
rather
than
promoted
recovery
let
them
be
consistent
let
them
propose
to
this
congress
the
complete
repeal
of
these
measures
the
way
is
open
to
such
a
proposal
let
action
be
positive
and
not
negative
the
way
is
open
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
an
expression
of
opinion
by
yeas
and
nays
shall
we
say
that
values
are
restored
and
that
the
congress
will
therefore
repeal
the
laws
under
which
we
have
been
bringing
them
back
shall
we
say
that
because
national
income
has
grown
with
rising
prosperity
we
shall
repeal
existing
taxes
and
thereby
put
off
the
day
of
approaching
a
balanced
budget
and
of
starting
to
reduce
the
national
debt
shall
we
abandon
the
reasonable
support
and
regulation
of
banking
shall
we
restore
the
dollar
to
its
former
gold
content
shall
we
say
to
the
farmer
the
prices
for
your
products
are
in
part
restored
now
go
and
hoe
your
own
row
shall
we
say
to
the
home
owners
we
have
reduced
your
rates
of
interest
we
have
no
further
concern
with
how
you
keep
your
home
or
what
you
pay
for
your
money
that
is
your
affair
shall
we
say
to
the
several
millions
of
unemployed
citizens
who
face
the
very
problem
of
existence
of
getting
enough
to
eat
we
will
withdraw
from
giving
you
work
we
will
turn
you
back
to
the
charity
of
your
communities
and
those
men
of
selfish
power
who
tell
you
that
perhaps
they
will
employ
you
if
the
government
leaves
them
strictly
alone
shall
we
say
to
the
needy
unemployed
your
problem
is
a
local
one
except
that
perhaps
the
federal
government
as
an
act
of
mere
generosity
will
be
willing
to
pay
to
your
city
or
to
your
county
a
few
grudging
dollars
to
help
maintain
your
soup
kitchens
shall
we
say
to
the
children
who
have
worked
all
day
in
the
factories
child
labor
is
a
local
issue
and
so
are
your
starvation
wages
something
to
be
solved
or
left
unsolved
by
the
jurisdiction
of
fortyeight
states
shall
we
say
to
the
laborer
your
right
to
organize
your
relations
with
your
employer
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
interest
if
your
employer
will
not
even
meet
with
you
to
discuss
your
problems
and
his
that
is
none
of
our
affair
shall
we
say
to
the
unemployed
and
the
aged
social
security
lies
not
within
the
province
of
the
federal
government
you
must
seek
relief
elsewhere
shall
we
say
to
the
men
and
women
who
live
in
conditions
of
squalor
in
country
and
in
city
the
health
and
the
happiness
of
you
and
your
children
are
no
concern
of
ours
shall
we
expose
our
population
once
more
by
the
repeal
of
laws
which
protect
them
against
the
loss
of
their
honest
investments
and
against
the
manipulations
of
dishonest
speculators
shall
we
abandon
the
splendid
efforts
of
the
federal
government
to
raise
the
health
standards
of
the
nation
and
to
give
youth
a
decent
opportunity
through
such
means
as
the
civilian
conservation
corps
members
of
the
congress
let
these
challenges
be
met
if
this
is
what
these
gentlemen
want
let
them
say
so
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
let
them
no
longer
hide
their
dissent
in
a
cowardly
cloak
of
generality
let
them
define
the
issue
we
have
been
specific
in
our
affirmative
action
let
them
be
specific
in
their
negative
attack
but
the
challenge
faced
by
this
congress
is
more
menacing
than
merely
a
return
to
the
pastbad
as
that
would
be
our
resplendent
economic
autocracy
does
not
want
to
return
to
that
individualism
of
which
they
prate
even
though
the
advantages
under
that
system
went
to
the
ruthless
and
the
strong
they
realize
that
in
thirtyfour
months
we
have
built
up
new
instruments
of
public
power
in
the
hands
of
a
peoples
government
this
power
is
wholesome
and
proper
but
in
the
hands
of
political
puppets
of
an
economic
autocracy
such
power
would
provide
shackles
for
the
liberties
of
the
people
give
them
their
way
and
they
will
take
the
course
of
every
autocracy
of
the
pastpower
for
themselves
enslavement
for
the
public
their
weapon
is
the
weapon
of
fear
i
have
said
the
only
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itself
that
is
as
true
today
as
it
was
in
but
such
fear
as
they
instill
today
is
not
a
natural
fear
a
normal
fear
it
is
a
synthetic
manufactured
poisonous
fear
that
is
being
spread
subtly
expensively
and
cleverly
by
the
same
people
who
cried
in
those
other
days
save
us
save
us
lest
we
perish
i
am
confident
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
well
understands
the
facts
and
is
ready
to
wage
unceasing
warfare
against
those
who
seek
a
continuation
of
that
spirit
of
fear
the
carrying
out
of
the
laws
of
the
land
as
enacted
by
the
congress
requires
protection
until
final
adjudication
by
the
highest
tribunal
of
the
land
the
congress
has
the
right
and
can
find
the
means
to
protect
its
own
prerogatives
we
are
justified
in
our
present
confidence
restoration
of
national
income
which
shows
continuing
gains
for
the
third
successive
year
supports
the
normal
and
logical
policies
under
which
agriculture
and
industry
are
returning
to
full
activity
under
these
policies
we
approach
a
balance
of
the
national
budget
national
income
increases
tax
receipts
based
on
that
income
increase
without
the
levying
of
new
taxes
that
is
why
i
am
able
to
say
to
this
the
second
session
of
the
th
congress
that
it
is
my
belief
based
on
existing
laws
that
no
new
taxes
over
and
above
the
present
taxes
are
either
advisable
or
necessary
national
income
increases
employment
increases
therefore
we
can
look
forward
to
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
those
citizens
who
are
in
need
therefore
also
we
can
anticipate
a
reduction
in
our
appropriations
for
relief
in
the
light
of
our
substantial
material
progress
in
the
light
of
the
increasing
effectiveness
of
the
restoration
of
popular
rule
i
recommend
to
the
congress
that
we
advance
that
we
do
not
retreat
i
have
confidence
that
you
will
not
fail
the
people
of
the
nation
whose
mandate
you
have
already
so
faithfully
fulfilled
i
repeat
with
the
same
faith
and
the
same
determination
my

words
of
march
we
face
the
arduous
days
that
lie
before
us
in
the
warm
courage
of
national
unity
with
a
clear
consciousness
of
seeking
old
and
precious
moral
values
with
a
clean
satisfaction
that
comes
from
the
stern
performance
of
duty
by
old
and
young
alike
we
aim
at
the
assurance
of
a
rounded
and
permanent
national
life
we
do
not
distrust
the
future
of
essential
democracy
i
cannot
better
end
this
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
than
by
repeating
the
words
of
a
wise
philosopher
at
whose
feet
i
sat
many
many
years
ago
what
great
crises
teach
all
men
whom
the
example
and
counsel
of
the
brave
inspire
is
the
lesson
fear
not
view
all
the
tasks
of
life
as
sacred
have
faith
in
the
triumph
of
the
ideal
give
daily
all
that
you
have
to
give
be
loyal
and
rejoice
whenever
you
find
yourselves
part
of
a
great
ideal
enterprise
you
at
this
moment
have
the
honor
to
belong
to
a
generation
whose
lips
are
touched
by
fire
you
live
in
a
land
that
now
enjoys
the
blessings
of
peace
but
let
nothing
human
be
wholly
alien
to
you
the
human
race
now
passes
through
one
of
its
great
crises
new
ideas
new
issuesa
new
call
for
men
to
carry
on
the
work
of
righteousness
of
charity
of
courage
of
patience
and
of
loyalty
however
memory
bring
back
this
moment
to
your
minds
let
it
be
able
to
say
to
you
that
was
a
great
moment
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
this
world
in
its
crisis
called
for
volunteers
for
men
of
faith
in
life
of
patience
in
service
of
charity
and
of
insight
i
responded
to
the
call
however
i
could
i
volunteered
to
give
myself
to
my
masterthe
cause
of
humane
and
brave
living
i
studied
i
loved
i
labored
unsparingly
and
hopefully
to
be
worthy
of
my
generation

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
constitution
wisely
provides
that
the
chief
executive
shall
report
to
the
congress
on
the
state
of
the
union
for
through
you
the
chosen
legislative
representatives
our
citizens
everywhere
may
fairly
judge
the
progress
of
our
governing
i
am
confident
that
today
in
the
light
of
the
events
of
the
past
two
years
you
do
not
consider
it
merely
a
trite
phrase
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
truly
glad
to
greet
you
and
that
i
look
forward
to
common
counsel
to
useful
cooperation
and
to
genuine
friendships
between
us
we
have
undertaken
a
new
order
of
things
yet
we
progress
to
it
under
the
framework
and
in
the
spirit
and
intent
of
the
american
constitution
we
have
proceeded
throughout
the
nation
a
measurable
distance
on
the
road
toward
this
new
order
materially
i
can
report
to
you
substantial
benefits
to
our
agricultural
population
increased
industrial
activity
and
profits
to
our
merchants
of
equal
moment
there
is
evident
a
restoration
of
that
spirit
of
confidence
and
faith
which
marks
the
american
character
let
him
who
for
speculative
profit
or
partisan
purpose
without
just
warrant
would
seek
to
disturb
or
dispel
this
assurance
take
heed
before
he
assumes
responsibility
for
any
act
which
slows
our
onward
steps
throughout
the
world
change
is
the
order
of
the
day
in
every
nation
economic
problems
long
in
the
making
have
brought
crises
of
many
kinds
for
which
the
masters
of
old
practice
and
theory
were
unprepared
in
most
nations
social
justice
no
longer
a
distant
ideal
has
become
a
definite
goal
and
ancient
governments
are
beginning
to
heed
the
call
thus
the
american
people
do
not
stand
alone
in
the
world
in
their
desire
for
change
we
seek
it
through
tested
liberal
traditions
through
processes
which
retain
all
of
the
deep
essentials
of
that
republican
form
of
representative
government
first
given
to
a
troubled
world
by
the
united
states
as
the
various
parts
in
the
program
begun
in
the
extraordinary
session
of
the
rd
congress
shape
themselves
in
practical
administration
the
unity
of
our
program
reveals
itself
to
the
nation
the
outlines
of
the
new
economic
order
rising
from
the
disintegration
of
the
old
are
apparent
we
test
what
we
have
done
as
our
measures
take
root
in
the
living
texture
of
life
we
see
where
we
have
built
wisely
and
where
we
can
do
still
better
the
attempt
to
make
a
distinction
between
recovery
and
reform
is
a
narrowly
conceived
effort
to
substitute
the
appearance
of
reality
for
reality
itself
when
a
man
is
convalescing
from
illness
wisdom
dictates
not
only
cure
of
the
symptoms
but
also
removal
of
their
cause
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
while
we
seek
to
outlaw
specific
abuses
the
american
objective
of
today
has
an
infinitely
deeper
finer
and
more
lasting
purpose
than
mere
repression
thinking
people
in
almost
every
country
of
the
world
have
come
to
realize
certain
fundamental
difficulties
with
which
civilization
must
reckon
rapid
changesthe
machine
age
the
advent
of
universal
and
rapid
communication
and
many
other
new
factorshave
brought
new
problems
succeeding
generations
have
attempted
to
keep
pace
by
reforming
in
piecemeal
fashion
this
or
that
attendant
abuse
as
a
result
evils
overlap
and
reform
becomes
confused
and
frustrated
we
lose
sight
from
time
to
time
of
our
ultimate
human
objectives
let
us
for
a
moment
strip
from
our
simple
purpose
the
confusion
that
results
from
a
multiplicity
of
detail
and
from
millions
of
written
and
spoken
words
we
find
our
population
suffering
from
old
inequalities
little
changed
by
vast
sporadic
remedies
in
spite
of
our
efforts
and
in
spite
of
our
talk
we
have
not
weeded
out
the
over
privileged
and
we
have
not
effectively
lifted
up
the
underprivileged
both
of
these
manifestations
of
injustice
have
retarded
happiness
no
wise
man
has
any
intention
of
destroying
what
is
known
as
the
profit
motive
because
by
the
profit
motive
we
mean
the
right
by
work
to
earn
a
decent
livelihood
for
ourselves
and
for
our
families
we
have
however
a
clear
mandate
from
the
people
that
americans
must
forswear
that
conception
of
the
acquisition
of
wealth
which
through
excessive
profits
creates
undue
private
power
over
private
affairs
and
to
our
misfortune
over
public
affairs
as
well
in
building
toward
this
end
we
do
not
destroy
ambition
nor
do
we
seek
to
divide
our
wealth
into
equal
shares
on
stated
occasions
we
continue
to
recognize
the
greater
ability
of
some
to
earn
more
than
others
but
we
do
assert
that
the
ambition
of
the
individual
to
obtain
for
him
and
his
a
proper
security
a
reasonable
leisure
and
a
decent
living
throughout
life
is
an
ambition
to
be
preferred
to
the
appetite
for
great
wealth
and
great
power
i
recall
to
your
attention
my
message
to
the
congress
last
june
in
which
i
said
among
our
objectives
i
place
the
security
of
the
men
women
and
children
of
the
nation
first
that
remains
our
first
and
continuing
task
and
in
a
very
real
sense
every
major
legislative
enactment
of
this
congress
should
be
a
component
part
of
it
in
defining
immediate
factors
which
enter
into
our
quest
i
have
spoken
to
the
congress
and
the
people
of
three
great
divisions
the
security
of
a
livelihood
through
the
better
use
of
the
national
resources
of
the
land
in
which
we
live
the
security
against
the
major
hazards
and
vicissitudes
of
life
the
security
of
decent
homes
i
am
now
ready
to
submit
to
the
congress
a
broad
program
designed
ultimately
to
establish
all
three
of
these
factors
of
securitya
program
which
because
of
many
lost
years
will
take
many
future
years
to
fulfill
a
study
of
our
national
resources
more
comprehensive
than
any
previously
made
shows
the
vast
amount
of
necessary
and
practicable
work
which
needs
to
be
done
for
the
development
and
preservation
of
our
natural
wealth
for
the
enjoyment
and
advantage
of
our
people
in
generations
to
come
the
sound
use
of
land
and
water
is
far
more
comprehensive
than
the
mere
planting
of
trees
building
of
dams
distributing
of
electricity
or
retirement
of
submarginal
land
it
recognizes
that
stranded
populations
either
in
the
country
or
the
city
cannot
have
security
under
the
conditions
that
now
surround
them
to
this
end
we
are
ready
to
begin
to
meet
this
problemthe
intelligent
care
of
population
throughout
our
nation
in
accordance
with
an
intelligent
distribution
of
the
means
of
livelihood
for
that
population
a
definite
program
for
putting
people
to
work
of
which
i
shall
speak
in
a
moment
is
a
component
part
of
this
greater
program
of
security
of
livelihood
through
the
better
use
of
our
national
resources
closely
related
to
the
broad
problem
of
livelihood
is
that
of
security
against
the
major
hazards
of
life
here
also
a
comprehensive
survey
of
what
has
been
attempted
or
accomplished
in
many
nations
and
in
many
states
proves
to
me
that
the
time
has
come
for
action
by
the
national
government
i
shall
send
to
you
in
a
few
days
definite
recommendations
based
on
these
studies
these
recommendations
will
cover
the
broad
subjects
of
unemployment
insurance
and
old
age
insurance
of
benefits
for
children
form
others
for
the
handicapped
for
maternity
care
and
for
other
aspects
of
dependency
and
illness
where
a
beginning
can
now
be
made
the
third
factorbetter
homes
for
our
peoplehas
also
been
the
subject
of
experimentation
and
study
here
too
the
first
practical
steps
can
be
made
through
the
proposals
which
i
shall
suggest
in
relation
to
giving
work
to
the
unemployed
whatever
we
plan
and
whatever
we
do
should
be
in
the
light
of
these
three
clear
objectives
of
security
we
cannot
afford
to
lose
valuable
time
in
haphazard
public
policies
which
cannot
find
a
place
in
the
broad
outlines
of
these
major
purposes
in
that
spirit
i
come
to
an
immediate
issue
made
for
us
by
hard
and
inescapable
circumstancethe
task
of
putting
people
to
work
in
the
spring
of
the
issue
of
destitution
seemed
to
stand
apart
today
in
the
light
of
our
experience
and
our
new
national
policy
we
find
we
can
put
people
to
work
in
ways
which
conform
to
initiate
and
carry
forward
the
broad
principles
of
that
policy
the
first
objectives
of
emergency
legislation
of
were
to
relieve
destitution
to
make
it
possible
for
industry
to
operate
in
a
more
rational
and
orderly
fashion
and
to
put
behind
industrial
recovery
the
impulse
of
large
expenditures
in
government
undertakings
the
purpose
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
to
provide
work
for
more
people
succeeded
in
a
substantial
manner
within
the
first
few
months
of
its
life
and
the
act
has
continued
to
maintain
employment
gains
and
greatly
improved
working
conditions
in
industry
the
program
of
public
works
provided
for
in
the
recovery
act
launched
the
federal
government
into
a
task
for
which
there
was
little
time
to
make
preparation
and
little
american
experience
to
follow
great
employment
has
been
given
and
is
being
given
by
these
works
more
than
two
billions
of
dollars
have
also
been
expended
in
direct
relief
to
the
destitute
local
agencies
of
necessity
determined
the
recipients
of
this
form
of
relief
with
inevitable
exceptions
the
funds
were
spent
by
them
with
reasonable
efficiency
and
as
a
result
actual
want
of
food
and
clothing
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
has
been
overcome
but
the
stark
fact
before
us
is
that
great
numbers
still
remain
unemployed
a
large
proportion
of
these
unemployed
and
their
dependents
have
been
forced
on
the
relief
rolls
the
burden
on
the
federal
government
has
grown
with
great
rapidity
we
have
here
a
human
as
well
as
an
economic
problem
when
humane
considerations
are
concerned
americans
give
them
precedence
the
lessons
of
history
confirmed
by
the
evidence
immediately
before
me
show
conclusively
that
continued
dependence
upon
relief
induces
a
spiritual
and
moral
disintegration
fundamentally
destructive
to
the
national
fibre
to
dole
out
relief
in
this
way
is
to
administer
a
narcotic
a
subtle
destroyer
of
the
human
spirit
it
is
inimical
to
the
dictates
of
sound
policy
it
is
in
violation
of
the
traditions
of
america
work
must
be
found
for
ablebodied
but
destit
ute
workers
the
federal
government
must
and
shall
quit
this
business
of
relief
i
am
not
willing
that
the
vitality
of
our
people
be
further
sapped
by
the
giving
of
cash
of
market
baskets
of
a
few
hours
of
weekly
work
cutting
grass
raking
leaves
or
picking
up
papers
in
the
public
parks
we
must
preserve
not
only
the
bodies
of
the
unemployed
from
destitution
but
also
their
selfrespect
their
selfreliance
and
courage
and
determination
this
decision
brings
me
to
the
problem
of
what
the
government
should
do
with
approximately
five
million
unemployed
now
on
the
relief
rolls
about
one
million
and
a
half
of
these
belong
to
the
group
which
in
the
past
was
dependent
upon
local
welfare
efforts
most
of
them
are
unable
for
one
reason
or
another
to
maintain
themselves
independentlyfor
the
most
part
through
no
fault
of
their
own
such
people
in
the
days
before
the
great
depression
were
cared
for
by
local
effortsby
states
by
counties
by
towns
by
cities
by
churches
and
by
private
welfare
agencies
it
is
my
thought
that
in
the
future
they
must
be
cared
for
as
they
were
before
i
stand
ready
through
my
own
personal
efforts
and
through
the
public
influence
of
the
office
that
i
hold
to
help
these
local
agencies
to
get
the
means
necessary
to
assume
this
burden
the
security
legislation
which
i
shall
propose
to
the
congress
will
i
am
confident
be
of
assistance
to
local
effort
in
the
care
of
this
type
of
cases
local
responsibility
can
and
will
be
resumed
for
after
all
common
sense
tells
us
that
the
wealth
necessary
for
this
task
existed
and
still
exists
in
the
local
community
and
the
dictates
of
sound
administration
require
that
this
responsibility
be
in
the
first
instance
a
local
one
there
are
however
an
additional
three
and
one
half
million
employable
people
who
are
on
relief
with
them
the
problem
is
different
and
the
responsibility
is
different
this
group
was
the
victim
of
a
nationwide
depression
caused
by
conditions
which
were
not
local
but
national
the
federal
government
is
the
only
governmental
agency
with
sufficient
power
and
credit
to
meet
this
situation
we
have
assumed
this
task
and
we
shall
not
shrink
from
it
in
the
future
it
is
a
duty
dictated
by
every
intelligent
consideration
of
national
policy
to
ask
you
to
make
it
possible
for
the
united
states
to
give
employment
to
all
of
these
three
and
one
half
million
employable
people
now
on
relief
pending
their
absorption
in
a
rising
tide
of
private
employment
it
is
my
thought
that
with
the
exception
of
certain
of
the
normal
public
building
operations
of
the
government
all
emergency
public
works
shall
be
united
in
a
single
new
and
greatly
enlarged
plan
with
the
establishment
of
this
new
system
we
can
supersede
the
federal
emergency
relief
administration
with
a
coordinated
authority
which
will
be
charged
with
the
orderly
liquidation
of
our
present
relief
activities
and
the
substitution
of
a
national
chart
for
the
giving
of
work
this
new
program
of
emergency
public
employment
should
be
governed
by
a
number
of
practical
principles
all
work
undertaken
should
be
usefulnot
just
for
a
day
or
a
year
but
useful
in
the
sense
that
it
affords
permanent
improvement
in
living
conditions
or
that
it
creates
future
new
wealth
for
the
nation
compensation
on
emergency
public
projects
should
be
in
the
form
of
security
payments
which
should
be
larger
than
the
amount
now
received
as
a
relief
dole
but
at
the
same
time
not
so
large
as
to
encourage
the
rejection
of
opportunities
for
private
employment
or
the
leaving
of
private
employment
to
engage
in
government
work
projects
should
be
undertaken
on
which
a
large
percentage
of
direct
labor
can
be
used
preference
should
be
given
to
those
projects
which
will
be
selfliquidating
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
government
will
get
its
money
back
at
some
future
time
the
projects
undertaken
should
be
selected
and
planned
so
as
to
compete
as
little
as
possible
with
private
enterprises
this
suggests
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
necessity
of
giving
useful
work
to
the
unemployed
now
on
relief
these
projects
in
most
instances
would
not
now
be
undertaken
the
planning
of
projects
would
seek
to
assure
work
during
the
coming
fiscal
year
to
the
individuals
now
on
relief
or
until
such
time
as
private
employment
is
available
in
order
to
make
adjustment
to
increasing
private
employment
work
should
be
planned
with
a
view
to
tapering
it
off
in
proportion
to
the
speed
with
which
the
emergency
workers
are
offered
positions
with
private
employers
effort
should
be
made
to
locate
projects
where
they
will
serve
the
greatest
unemployment
needs
as
shown
by
present
relief
rolls
and
the
broad
program
of
the
national
resources
board
should
be
freely
used
for
guidance
in
selection
our
ultimate
objective
being
the
enrichment
of
human
lives
the
government
has
the
primary
duty
to
use
its
emergency
expenditures
as
much
as
possible
to
serve
those
who
cannot
secure
the
advantages
of
private
capital
ever
since
the
adjournment
of
the
d
congress
the
administration
has
been
studying
from
every
angle
the
possibility
and
the
practicability
of
new
forms
of
employment
as
a
result
of
these
studies
i
have
arrived
at
certain
very
definite
convictions
as
to
the
amount
of
money
that
will
be
necessary
for
the
sort
of
public
projects
that
i
have
described
i
shall
submit
these
figures
in
my
budget
message
i
assure
you
now
they
will
be
within
the
sound
credit
of
the
government
the
work
itself
will
cover
a
wide
field
including
clearance
of
slums
which
for
adequate
reasons
cannot
be
undertaken
by
private
capital
in
rural
housing
of
several
kinds
where
again
private
capital
is
unable
to
function
in
rural
electrification
in
the
reforestation
of
the
great
watersheds
of
the
nation
in
an
intensified
program
to
prevent
soil
erosion
and
to
reclaim
blighted
areas
in
improving
existing
road
systems
and
in
constructing
national
highways
designed
to
handle
modern
traffic
in
the
elimination
of
grade
crossings
in
the
extension
and
enlargement
of
the
successful
work
of
the
civilian
conservation
corps
in
nonfederal
works
mostly
selfliquidating
and
highly
useful
to
local
divisions
of
government
and
on
many
other
projects
which
the
nation
needs
and
cannot
afford
to
neglect
this
is
the
method
which
i
propose
to
you
in
order
that
we
may
better
meet
this
presentday
problem
of
unemployment
its
greatest
advantage
is
that
it
fits
logically
and
usefully
into
the
longrange
permanent
policy
of
providing
the
three
types
of
security
which
constitute
as
a
whole
an
american
plan
for
the
betterment
of
the
future
of
the
american
people
i
shall
consult
with
you
from
time
to
time
concerning
other
measures
of
national
importance
among
the
subjects
that
lie
immediately
before
us
are
the
consolidation
of
federal
regulatory
administration
over
all
forms
of
transportation
the
renewal
and
clarification
of
the
general
purposes
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
the
strengthening
of
our
facilities
for
the
prevention
detection
and
treatment
of
crime
and
criminals
the
restoration
of
sound
conditions
in
the
public
utilities
field
through
abolition
of
the
evil
features
of
holding
companies
the
gradual
tapering
off
of
the
emergency
credit
activities
of
government
and
improvement
in
our
taxation
forms
and
methods
we
have
already
begun
to
feel
the
bracing
effect
upon
our
economic
system
of
a
restored
agriculture
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
additional
income
that
farmers
are
receiving
are
finding
their
way
into
the
channels
of
trade
the
farmers
share
of
the
national
income
is
slowly
rising
the
economic
facts
justify
the
widespread
opinion
of
those
engaged
in
agriculture
that
our
provisions
for
maintaining
a
balanced
production
give
at
this
time
the
most
adequate
remedy
for
an
old
and
vexing
problem
for
the
present
and
especially
in
view
of
abnormal
world
conditions
agricultural
adjustment
with
certain
necessary
improvements
in
methods
should
continue
it
seems
appropriate
to
call
attention
at
this
time
to
the
fine
spirit
shown
during
the
past
year
by
our
public
servants
i
cannot
praise
too
highly
the
cheerful
work
of
the
civil
service
employees
and
of
those
temporarily
working
for
the
government
as
for
those
thousands
in
our
various
public
agencies
spread
throughout
the
country
who
without
compensation
agreed
to
take
over
heavy
responsibilities
in
connection
with
our
various
loan
agencies
and
particularly
in
direct
relief
work
i
cannot
say
too
much
i
do
not
think
any
country
could
show
a
higher
average
of
cheerful
and
even
enthusiastic
teamwork
than
has
been
shown
by
these
men
and
women
i
cannot
with
candor
tell
you
that
general
international
relationships
outside
the
borders
of
the
united
states
are
improved
on
the
surface
of
things
many
old
jealousies
are
resurrected
old
passions
aroused
new
strivings
for
armament
and
power
in
more
than
one
land
rear
their
ugly
heads
i
hope
that
calm
counsel
and
constructive
leadership
will
provide
the
steadying
influence
and
the
time
necessary
for
the
coming
of
new
and
more
practical
forms
of
representative
government
throughout
the
world
wherein
privilege
and
power
will
occupy
a
lesser
place
and
world
welfare
a
greater
i
believe
however
that
our
own
peaceful
and
neighborly
attitude
toward
other
nations
is
coming
to
be
understood
and
appreciated
the
maintenance
of
international
peace
is
a
matter
in
which
we
are
deeply
and
unselfishly
concerned
evidence
of
our
persistent
and
undeniable
desire
to
prevent
armed
conflict
has
recently
been
more
than
once
afforded
there
is
no
ground
for
apprehension
that
our
relations
with
any
nation
will
be
otherwise
than
peaceful
nor
is
there
ground
for
doubt
that
the
people
of
most
nations
seek
relief
from
the
threat
and
burden
attaching
to
the
false
theory
that
extravagant
armament
cannot
be
reduced
and
limited
by
international
accord
the
ledger
of
the
past
year
shows
many
more
gains
than
losses
let
us
not
forget
that
in
addition
to
saving
millions
from
utter
destitution
child
labor
has
been
for
the
moment
outlawed
thousands
of
homes
saved
to
their
owners
and
most
imp
ortant
of
all
the
morale
of
the
nation
has
been
restored
viewing
the
year
as
a
whole
you
and
i
can
agree
that
we
have
a
generous
measure
of
reasons
for
giving
thanks
it
is
not
empty
optimism
that
moves
me
to
a
strong
hope
in
the
coming
year
we
can
if
we
will
make
a
genuine
period
of
good
feeling
sustained
by
a
sense
of
purposeful
progress
beyond
the
material
recovery
i
sense
a
spiritual
recovery
as
well
the
people
of
america
are
turning
as
never
before
to
those
permanent
values
that
are
not
limited
to
the
physical
objectives
of
life
there
are
growing
signs
of
this
on
every
hand
in
the
face
of
these
spiritual
impulses
we
are
sensible
of
the
divine
providence
to
which
nations
turn
now
as
always
for
guidance
and
fostering
care

mr
president
mr
speaker
senators
and
representatives
in
congress
i
come
before
you
at
the
opening
of
the
regular
session
of
the
d
congress
not
to
make
requests
for
special
or
detailed
items
of
legislation
i
come
rather
to
counsel
with
you
who
like
myself
have
been
selected
to
carry
out
a
mandate
of
the
whole
people
in
order
that
without
partisanship
you
and
i
may
cooperate
to
continue
the
restoration
of
our
national
wellbeing
and
equally
important
to
build
on
the
ruins
of
the
past
a
new
structure
designed
better
to
meet
the
present
problems
of
modern
civilization
such
a
structure
includes
not
only
the
relations
of
industry
and
agriculture
and
finance
to
each
other
but
also
the
effect
which
all
of
these
three
have
on
our
individual
citizens
and
on
the
whole
people
as
a
nation
now
that
we
are
definitely
in
the
process
of
recovery
lines
have
been
rightly
drawn
between
those
to
whom
this
recovery
means
a
return
to
old
methodsand
the
number
of
these
people
is
smalland
those
for
whom
recovery
means
a
reform
of
many
old
methods
a
permanent
readjustment
of
many
of
our
ways
of
thinking
and
therefore
of
many
of
our
social
and
economic
arrangements
civilization
cannot
go
back
civilization
must
not
stand
still
we
have
undertaken
new
methods
it
is
our
task
to
perfect
to
improve
to
alter
when
necessary
but
in
all
cases
to
go
forward
to
consolidate
what
we
are
doing
to
make
our
economic
and
social
structure
capable
of
dealing
with
modern
life
is
the
joint
task
of
the
legislative
the
judicial
and
the
executive
branches
of
the
national
government
without
regard
to
party
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
people
seek
a
greater
opportunity
for
humanity
to
prosper
and
find
happiness
they
recognize
that
human
welfare
has
not
increased
and
does
not
increase
through
mere
materialism
and
luxury
but
that
it
does
progress
through
integrity
unselfishness
responsibility
and
justice
in
the
past
few
months
as
a
result
of
our
action
we
have
demanded
of
many
citizens
that
they
surrender
certain
licenses
to
do
as
they
please
in
their
business
relationships
but
we
have
asked
this
in
exchange
for
the
protection
which
the
state
can
give
against
exploitation
by
their
fellow
men
or
by
combinations
of
their
fellow
men
i
congratulate
this
congress
upon
the
courage
the
earnestness
and
the
efficiency
with
which
you
met
the
crisis
at
the
special
session
it
was
your
fine
understanding
of
the
national
problem
that
furnished
the
example
which
the
country
has
so
splendidly
followed
i
venture
to
say
that
the
task
confronting
the
first
congress
of
was
no
greater
than
your
own
i
shall
not
attempt
to
set
forth
either
the
many
phases
of
the
crisis
which
we
experienced
last
march
or
the
many
measures
which
you
and
i
undertook
during
the
special
session
that
we
might
initiate
recovery
and
reform
it
is
sufficient
that
i
should
speak
in
broad
terms
of
the
results
of
our
common
counsel
the
credit
of
the
government
has
been
fortified
by
drastic
reduction
in
the
cost
of
its
permanent
agencies
through
the
economy
act
with
the
twofold
purpose
of
strengthening
the
whole
financial
structure
and
of
arriving
eventually
at
a
medium
of
exchange
which
over
the
years
will
have
less
variable
purchasing
and
debt
paying
power
for
our
people
than
that
of
the
past
i
have
used
the
authority
granted
me
to
purchase
all
americanproduced
gold
and
silver
and
to
buy
additional
gold
in
the
world
markets
careful
investigation
and
constant
study
prove
that
in
the
matter
of
foreign
exchange
rates
certain
of
our
sister
nations
find
themselves
so
handicapped
by
internal
and
other
conditions
that
they
feel
unable
at
this
time
to
enter
into
stabilization
discussion
based
on
permanent
and
worldwide
objectives
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
banks
both
national
and
state
which
reopened
last
spring
are
in
sound
condition
and
have
been
brought
within
the
protection
of
federal
insurance
in
the
case
of
those
banks
which
were
not
permitted
to
reopen
nearly
six
hundred
million
dollars
of
frozen
deposits
are
being
restored
to
the
depositors
through
the
assistance
of
the
national
government
we
have
made
great
strides
toward
the
objectives
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
for
not
only
have
several
millions
of
our
unemployed
been
restored
to
work
but
industry
is
organizing
itself
with
a
greater
understanding
that
reasonable
profits
can
be
earned
while
at
the
same
time
protection
can
be
assured
to
guarantee
to
labor
adequate
pay
and
proper
conditions
of
work
child
labor
is
abolished
uniform
standards
of
hours
and
wages
apply
today
to
percent
of
industrial
employment
within
the
field
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
we
seek
the
definite
end
of
preventing
combinations
in
furtherance
of
monopoly
and
in
restraint
of
trade
while
at
the
same
time
we
seek
to
prevent
ruinous
rivalries
within
industrial
groups
which
in
many
cases
resemble
the
gang
wars
of
the
underworld
and
in
which
the
real
victim
in
every
case
is
the
public
itself
under
the
authority
of
this
congress
we
have
brought
the
component
parts
of
each
industry
together
around
a
common
table
just
as
we
have
brought
problems
affecting
labor
to
a
common
meeting
ground
though
the
machinery
hurriedly
devised
may
need
readjustment
from
time
to
time
nevertheless
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
we
have
created
a
permanent
feature
of
our
modernized
industrial
structure
and
that
it
will
continue
under
the
supervision
but
not
the
arbitrary
dictation
of
government
itself
you
recognized
last
spring
that
the
most
serious
part
of
the
debt
burden
affected
those
who
stood
in
danger
of
losing
their
farms
and
their
homes
i
am
glad
to
tell
you
that
refinancing
in
both
of
these
cases
is
proceeding
with
good
success
and
in
all
probability
within
the
financial
limits
set
by
the
congress
but
agriculture
had
suffered
from
more
than
its
debts
actual
experience
with
the
operation
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
leads
to
my
belief
that
thus
far
the
experiment
of
seeking
a
balance
between
production
and
consumption
is
succeeding
and
has
made
progress
entirely
in
line
with
reasonable
expectations
toward
the
restoration
of
farm
prices
to
parity
i
continue
in
my
conviction
that
industrial
progress
and
prosperity
can
only
be
attained
by
bringing
the
purchasing
power
of
that
portion
of
our
population
which
in
one
form
or
another
is
dependent
upon
agriculture
up
to
a
level
which
will
restore
a
proper
balance
between
every
section
of
the
country
and
between
every
form
of
work
in
this
field
through
carefully
planned
flood
control
power
development
and
landuse
policies
in
the
tennessee
valley
and
in
other
great
watersheds
we
are
seeking
the
elimination
of
waste
the
removal
of
poor
lands
from
agriculture
and
the
encouragement
of
small
local
industries
thus
furthering
this
principle
of
a
better
balanced
national
life
we
recognize
the
great
ultimate
cost
of
the
application
of
this
rounded
policy
to
every
part
off
the
union
today
we
are
creating
heavy
obligations
to
start
the
work
because
of
the
great
unemployment
needs
of
the
moment
i
look
forward
however
to
the
time
in
the
not
distant
future
when
annual
appropriations
wholly
covered
by
current
revenue
will
enable
the
work
to
proceed
under
a
national
plan
such
a
national
plan
will
in
a
generation
or
two
return
many
times
the
money
spent
on
it
more
important
it
will
eliminate
the
use
of
inefficient
tools
conserve
and
increase
natural
resources
prevent
waste
and
enable
millions
of
our
people
to
take
better
advantage
of
the
opportunities
which
god
has
given
our
country
i
cannot
unfortunately
present
to
you
a
picture
of
complete
optimism
regarding
world
affairs
the
delegation
representing
the
united
states
has
worked
in
close
cooperation
with
the
other
american
republics
assembled
at
montevideo
to
make
that
conference
an
outstanding
success
we
have
i
hope
made
it
clear
to
our
neighbors
that
we
seek
with
them
future
avoidance
of
territorial
expansion
and
of
interference
by
one
nation
in
the
internal
affairs
of
another
furthermore
all
of
us
are
seeking
the
restoration
of
commerce
in
ways
which
will
preclude
the
building
up
of
large
favorable
trade
balances
by
any
one
nation
at
the
expense
of
trade
debits
on
the
part
of
other
nations
in
other
parts
of
the
world
however
fear
of
immediate
or
future
aggression
and
with
it
the
spending
of
vast
sums
on
armament
and
the
continued
building
up
of
defensive
trade
barriers
prevent
any
great
progress
in
peace
or
trade
agreements
i
have
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
cannot
take
part
in
political
arrangements
in
europe
but
that
we
stand
ready
to
cooperate
at
any
time
in
practicable
measures
on
a
world
basis
looking
to
immediate
reduction
of
armaments
and
the
lowering
of
the
barriers
against
commerce
i
expect
to
report
to
you
later
in
regard
to
debts
owed
the
government
and
people
of
this
country
by
the
governments
and
peoples
of
other
countries
several
nations
acknowledging
the
debt
have
paid
in
small
part
other
nations
have
failed
to
pay
one
nationfinlandhas
paid
the
installments
due
this
country
in
full
returning
to
home
problems
we
have
been
shocked
by
many
notorious
examples
of
injuries
done
our
citizens
by
persons
or
groups
who
have
been
living
off
their
neighbors
by
the
use
of
methods
either
unethical
or
criminal
in
the
first
categorya
field
which
does
not
involve
violations
of
the
letter
of
our
lawspractices
have
been
brought
to
light
which
have
shocked
those
who
believed
that
we
were
in
the
past
generation
raising
the
ethical
standards
of
business
they
call
for
stringent
preventive
or
regulatory
measures
i
am
speaking
of
those
individuals
who
have
evaded
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
our
tax
laws
of
those
high
officials
of
banks
or
corporations
who
have
grown
rich
at
the
expense
of
their
stockholders
or
the
public
of
those
reckless
speculators
with
their
own
or
other
peoples
money
whose
operations
have
injured
the
values
of
the
farmers
crops
and
the
savings
of
the
poor
in
the
other
category
crimes
of
organized
banditry
coldblooded
shooting
lynching
and
kidnapping
have
threatened
our
se
curity
these
violations
of
ethics
and
these
violations
of
law
call
on
the
strong
arm
of
government
for
their
immediate
suppression
they
call
also
on
the
country
for
an
aroused
public
opinion
the
adoption
of
the
twentyfirst
amendment
should
give
material
aid
to
the
elimination
of
those
new
forms
of
crime
which
came
from
the
illegal
traffic
in
liquor
i
shall
continue
to
regard
it
as
my
duty
to
use
whatever
means
may
be
necessary
to
supplement
state
local
and
private
agencies
for
the
relief
of
suffering
caused
by
unemployment
with
respect
to
this
question
i
have
recognized
the
dangers
inherent
in
the
direct
giving
of
relief
and
have
sought
the
means
to
provide
not
mere
relief
but
the
opportunity
for
useful
and
remunerative
work
we
shall
in
the
process
of
recovery
seek
to
move
as
rapidly
as
possible
from
direct
relief
to
publicly
supported
work
and
from
that
to
the
rapid
restoration
of
private
employment
it
is
to
the
eternal
credit
of
the
american
people
that
this
tremendous
readjustment
of
our
national
life
is
being
accomplished
peacefully
without
serious
dislocation
with
only
a
minimum
of
injustice
and
with
a
great
willing
spirit
of
cooperation
throughout
the
country
disorder
is
not
an
american
habit
selfhelp
and
selfcontrol
are
the
essence
of
the
american
traditionnot
of
necessity
the
form
of
that
tradition
but
its
spirit
the
program
itself
comes
from
the
american
people
it
is
an
integrated
program
national
in
scope
viewed
in
the
large
it
is
designed
to
save
from
destruction
and
to
keep
for
the
future
the
genuinely
important
values
created
by
modern
society
the
vicious
and
wasteful
parts
of
that
society
we
could
not
save
if
we
wished
they
have
chosen
the
way
of
selfdestruction
we
would
save
useful
mechanical
invention
machine
production
industrial
efficiency
modern
means
of
communication
broad
education
we
would
save
and
encourage
the
slowly
growing
impulse
among
consumers
to
enter
the
industrial
market
place
equipped
with
sufficient
organization
to
insist
upon
fair
prices
and
honest
sales
but
the
unnecessary
expansion
of
industrial
plants
the
waste
of
natural
resources
the
exploitation
of
the
consumers
of
natural
monopolies
the
accumulation
of
stagnant
surpluses
child
labor
and
the
ruthless
exploitation
of
all
labor
the
encouragement
of
speculation
with
other
peoples
money
these
were
consumed
in
the
fires
that
they
themselves
kindled
we
must
make
sure
that
as
we
reconstruct
our
life
there
be
no
soil
in
which
such
weeds
can
grow
again
we
have
plowed
the
furrow
and
planted
the
good
seed
the
hard
beginning
is
over
if
we
would
reap
the
full
harvest
we
must
cultivate
the
soil
where
this
good
seed
is
sprouting
and
the
plant
is
reaching
up
to
mature
growth
a
final
personal
word
i
know
that
each
of
you
will
appreciate
that
i
am
speaking
no
mere
politeness
when
i
assure
you
how
much
i
value
the
fine
relationship
that
we
have
shared
during
these
months
of
hard
and
incessant
work
out
of
these
friendly
contacts
we
are
fortunately
building
a
strong
and
permanent
tie
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
the
government
the
letter
of
the
constitution
wisely
declared
a
separation
but
the
impulse
of
common
purpose
declares
a
union
in
this
spirit
we
join
once
more
in
serving
the
american
people

gentlemen
of
the
congress
when
i
addressed
myself
to
performing
the
duty
laid
upon
the
president
by
the
constitution
to
present
to
you
an
annual
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
i
found
my
thought
dominated
by
an
immortal
sentence
of
abraham
lincolnslet
us
have
faith
that
right
makes
might
and
in
that
faith
let
us
dare
to
do
our
duty
as
we
understand
ita
sentence
immortal
because
it
embodies
in
a
form
of
utter
simplicity
and
purity
the
essential
faith
of
the
nation
the
faith
in
which
it
was
conceived
and
the
faith
in
which
it
has
grown
to
glory
and
power
with
that
faith
and
the
birth
of
a
nation
founded
upon
it
came
the
hope
into
the
world
that
a
new
order
would
prevail
throughout
the
affairs
of
mankind
an
order
in
which
reason
and
right
would
take
precedence
over
covetousness
and
force
and
i
believe
that
i
express
the
wish
and
purpose
of
every
thoughtful
american
when
i
say
that
this
sentence
marks
for
us
in
the
plainest
manner
the
part
we
should
play
alike
in
the
arrangement
of
our
domestic
affairs
and
in
our
exercise
of
influence
upon
the
affairs
of
the
world
by
this
faith
and
by
this
faith
alone
can
the
world
be
lifted
out
of
its
present
confusion
and
despair
it
was
this
faith
which
prevailed
over
the
wicked
force
of
germany
you
will
remember
that
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
war
came
when
the
german
people
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
conscience
of
the
world
and
realized
that
right
was
everywhere
arrayed
against
the
wrong
that
their
government
was
attempting
to
perpetrate
i
think
therefore
that
it
is
true
to
say
that
this
was
the
faith
which
won
the
war
certainly
this
is
the
faith
with
which
our
gallant
men
went
into
the
field
and
out
upon
the
seas
to
make
sure
of
victory
this
is
the
mission
upon
which
democracy
came
into
the
world
democracy
is
an
assertion
of
the
right
of
the
individual
to
live
and
to
be
treated
justly
as
against
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
any
combination
of
individuals
to
make
laws
which
will
overburden
him
or
which
will
destroy
his
equality
among
his
fellows
in
the
matter
of
right
or
privilege
and
i
think
we
all
realize
that
the
day
has
come
when
democracy
is
being
put
upon
its
final
test
the
old
world
is
just
now
suffering
from
a
wanton
rejection
of
the
principle
of
democracy
and
a
substitution
of
the
principle
of
autocracy
as
asserted
in
the
name
but
without
the
authority
and
sanction
of
the
multitude
this
is
the
time
of
all
others
when
democracy
should
prove
its
purity
and
its
spiritual
power
to
prevail
it
is
surely
the
manifest
destiny
of
the
united
states
to
lead
in
the
attempt
to
make
this
spirit
prevail
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
united
states
can
assist
to
accomplish
this
great
object
first
by
offering
the
example
within
her
own
borders
of
the
will
and
power
of
democracy
to
make
and
enforce
laws
which
are
unquestionably
just
and
which
are
equal
in
their
administrationlaws
which
secure
its
full
right
to
labor
and
yet
at
the
same
time
safeguard
the
integrity
of
property
and
particularly
of
that
property
which
is
devoted
to
the
development
of
industry
and
the
increase
of
the
necessary
wealth
of
the
world
second
by
standing
for
right
and
justice
as
toward
individual
nations
the
law
of
democracy
is
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
and
the
influence
of
every
democracy
in
the
world
should
be
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
nation
the
nation
which
is
struggling
toward
its
right
and
toward
its
proper
recognition
and
privilege
in
the
family
of
nations
the
united
states
cannot
refuse
this
role
of
champion
without
putting
the
stigma
of
rejection
upon
the
great
and
devoted
men
who
brought
its
government
into
existence
and
established
it
in
the
face
of
almost
universal
opposition
and
intrigue
even
in
the
face
of
wanton
force
as
for
example
against
the
orders
in
council
of
great
britain
and
the
arbitrary
napoleonic
decrees
which
involved
us
in
what
we
know
as
the
war
of
i
urge
you
to
consider
that
the
display
of
an
immediate
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
remedy
any
injustices
or
evils
that
may
have
shown
themselves
in
our
own
national
life
will
afford
the
most
effectual
offset
to
the
forces
of
chaos
and
tyranny
which
are
playing
so
disastrous
a
part
in
the
fortunes
of
the
free
peoples
of
more
than
one
part
of
the
world
the
united
states
is
of
necessity
the
sample
democracy
of
the
world
and
the
triumph
of
democracy
depends
upon
its
success
recovery
from
the
disturbing
and
sometimes
disastrous
effects
of
the
late
war
has
been
exceedingly
slow
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
has
given
promise
i
ventureto
say
of
early
completion
only
in
our
own
fortunate
country
but
even
with
us
the
recovery
halts
and
is
impeded
at
times
and
there
are
immediately
serviceable
acts
of
legislation
which
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
attempt
to
assist
that
recovery
and
prove
the
indestructible
recuperative
force
of
a
great
government
of
the
people
one
of
these
is
to
prove
that
a
great
democracy
can
keep
house
as
successfully
and
in
as
businesslike
a
fashion
as
any
other
government
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
step
toward
providing
this
is
to
supply
ourselves
with
a
systematic
method
of
handling
our
estimates
and
expenditures
and
bringing
them
to
the
point
where
they
will
not
be
an
unnecessary
strain
upon
our
income
or
necessitate
unreasonable
taxation
in
other
words
a
workable
budget
system
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
two
elements
are
essential
to
such
a
systemnamely
not
only
that
the
proposal
of
appropriations
should
be
in
the
hands
of
a
single
body
such
as
a
single
appropriations
committee
in
each
house
of
the
congress
but
also
that
this
body
should
be
brought
into
such
cooperation
with
the
departments
of
the
government
and
with
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
as
would
enable
it
to
act
upon
a
complete
conspectus
of
the
needs
of
the
government
and
the
resources
from
which
it
must
draw
its
income
i
reluctantly
vetoed
the
budget
bill
passed
by
the
last
session
of
the
congress
because
of
a
constitutional
objection
the
house
of
representatives
subsequently
modified
the
bill
in
order
to
meet
this
objection
in
the
revised
form
i
believe
that
the
bill
coupled
with
action
already
taken
by
the
congress
to
revise
its
rules
and
procedure
furnishes
the
foundation
for
an
effective
national
budget
system
i
earnestly
hope
therefore
that
one
of
the
first
steps
to
be
taken
by
the
present
session
of
the
congress
will
be
to
pass
the
budget
bill
the
nations
finances
have
shown
marked
improvement
during
the
last
year
the
total
ordinary
receipts
of
for
the
fiscal
year
exceeded
those
for
by
while
the
total
net
ordinary
expenditures
decreased
from
to
the
gross
public
debt
which
reached
its
highest
point
on
august
when
it
was
had
dropped
on
november
to
there
has
also
been
a
marked
decrease
in
holdings
of
government
war
securities
by
the
banking
institutions
of
the
country
as
well
as
in
the
amount
of
bills
held
by
the
federal
reserve
banks
secured
by
government
war
obligations
this
fortunate
result
has
relieved
the
banks
and
left
them
freer
to
finance
the
needs
of
agriculture
industry
and
commerce
it
has
been
due
in
large
part
to
the
reduction
of
the
public
debt
especially
of
the
floating
debt
but
more
particularly
to
the
improved
distribution
of
government
securities
among
permanent
investors
the
cessation
of
the
governments
borrowings
except
through
shortterm
certificates
of
indebtedness
has
been
a
matter
of
great
consequence
to
the
people
of
the
country
at
large
as
well
as
to
the
holders
of
liberty
bonds
and
victory
notes
and
has
had
an
important
bearing
on
the
matter
of
effective
credit
control
the
year
has
been
characterized
by
the
progressive
withdrawal
of
the
treasury
from
the
domestic
credit
market
and
from
a
position
of
dominant
influence
in
that
market
the
future
course
will
necessarily
depend
upon
the
extent
to
which
economies
are
practiced
and
upon
the
burdens
placed
upon
the
treasury
as
well
as
upon
industrial
developments
and
the
maintenance
of
tax
receipts
at
a
sufficiently
high
level
the
fundamental
fact
which
at
present
dominates
the
governments
financial
situation
is
that
seven
and
a
half
billions
of
its
war
indebtedness
mature
within
the
next
two
and
a
half
years
of
this
amount
two
and
a
half
billions
are
floating
debt
and
five
billions
victory
notes
and
war
savings
certificates
the
fiscal
program
of
the
government
must
be
determined
with
reference
to
these
maturities
sound
policy
demands
that
government
expenditures
be
reduced
to
the
lowest
amount
which
will
permit
the
various
services
to
operate
efficiently
and
that
government
receipts
from
taxes
and
salvage
be
maintained
sufficiently
high
to
provide
for
current
requirements
including
interest
and
sinking
fund
charges
on
the
public
debt
and
at
the
same
time
retire
the
floating
debt
and
part
of
the
victory
loan
before
maturity
with
rigid
economy
vigorous
salvage
operations
and
adequate
revenues
from
taxation
a
surplus
of
current
receipts
over
current
expenditures
can
be
realized
and
should
be
applied
to
the
floating
debt
all
branches
of
the
government
should
cooperate
to
see
that
this
program
is
realized
i
cannot
overemphasize
the
necessity
of
economy
in
government
appropriations
and
expenditures
and
the
avoidance
by
the
congress
of
practices
which
take
money
from
the
treasury
by
indefinite
or
revolving
fund
appropriations
the
estimates
for
the
present
year
show
that
over
a
billion
dollars
of
expenditures
were
authorized
by
the
last
congress
in
addition
to
the
amounts
shown
in
the
usual
compiled
statements
of
appropriations
this
strikingly
illustrates
the
importance
of
making
direct
and
specific
appropriations
the
relation
between
the
current
receipts
and
current
expenditures
of
the
government
during
the
present
fiscal
year
as
well
as
during
the
last
half
of
the
last
fiscal
year
has
been
disturbed
by
the
extraordinary
burdens
thrown
upon
the
treasury
by
the
transportation
act
in
connection
with
the
return
of
the
railroads
to
private
control
over
has
already
been
paid
to
the
railroads
under
this
act
during
the
present
fiscal
year
and
it

is
estimated
that
further
payments
aggregating
possibly
must
still
be
made
to
the
railroads
during
the
current
year
it
is
obvious
that
these
large
payments
have
already
seriously
limited
the
governments
progress
in
retiring
the
floating
debt
closely
connected
with
this
it
seems
to
me
is
the
necessity
for
an
immediate
consideration
of
the
revision
of
our
tax
laws
simplification
of
the
income
and
profits
taxes
has
become
an
immediate
necessity
these
taxes
performed
an
indispensable
service
during
the
war
the
need
for
their
simplification
however
is
very
great
in
order
to
save
the
taxpayer
inconvenience
and
expense
and
in
order
to
make
his
liability
more
certain
and
definite
other
and
more
detailed
recommendations
with
regard
to
taxes
will
no
doubt
be
laid
before
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
it
is
my
privilege
to
draw
to
the
attention
of
congress
for
very
sympathetic
consideration
the
problem
of
providing
adequate
facilities
for
the
care
and
treatment
of
former
members
of
the
military
and
naval
forces
who
are
sick
and
disabled
as
the
result
of
their
participation
in
the
war
these
heroic
men
can
never
be
paid
in
money
for
the
service
they
patriotically
rendered
the
nation
their
reward
will
lie
rather
in
realization
of
the
fact
that
they
vindicated
the
rights
of
their
country
and
aided
in
safeguarding
civilization
the
nations
gratitude
must
be
effectively
revealed
to
them
by
the
most
ample
provision
for
their
medical
care
and
treatment
as
well
as
for
their
vocational
training
and
placement
the
time
has
come
when
a
more
complete
program
can
be
formulated
and
more
satisfactorily
administered
for
their
treatment
and
training
and
i
earnestly
urge
that
the
congress
give
the
matter
its
early
consideration
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
board
for
vocational
education
will
outline
in
their
annual
reports
proposals
covering
medical
care
and
rehabilitation
which
i
am
sure
will
engage
your
earnest
study
and
commend
your
most
generous
support
permit
me
to
emphasize
once
more
the
need
for
action
upon
certain
matters
upon
which
i
dwelt
at
some
length
in
my
message
to
the
second
session
of
the
sixtysixth
congress
the
necessity
for
example
of
encouraging
the
manufacture
of
dyestuffs
and
related
chemicals
the
importance
of
doing
everything
possible
to
promote
agricultural
production
along
economic
lines
to
improve
agricultural
marketing
and
to
make
rural
life
more
attractive
and
healthful
the
need
for
a
law
regulating
cold
storage
in
such
a
way
as
to
limit
the
time
during
which
goods
may
be
kept
in
storage
prescribing
the
method
of
disposing
of
them
if
kept
beyond
the
permitted
period
and
requiring
goods
released
from
storage
in
all
cases
to
bear
the
date
of
their
receipt
it
would
also
be
most
serviceable
if
it
were
provided
that
all
goods
released
from
cold
storage
for
interstate
shipment
should
have
plainly
marked
upon
each
package
the
selling
or
market
price
at
which
they
went
into
storage
in
order
that
the
purchaser
might
be
able
to
learn
what
profits
stood
between
him
and
the
producer
or
the
wholesale
dealer
indeed
it
would
be
very
serviceable
to
the
public
if
all
goods
destined
for
interstate
commerce
were
made
to
carry
upon
every
packing
case
whose
form
made
it
possible
a
plain
statement
of
the
price
at
which
they
left
the
hands
of
the
producer
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
also
to
the
recommendations
of
the
message
referred
to
with
regard
to
a
federal
license
for
all
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
in
brief
the
immediate
legislative
need
of
the
time
is
the
removal
of
all
obstacles
to
the
realization
of
the
best
ambitions
of
our
people
in
their
several
classes
of
employment
and
the
strengthening
of
all
instrumentalities
by
which
difficulties
are
to
be
met
and
removed
and
justice
dealt
out
whether
by
law
or
by
some
form
of
mediation
and
conciliation
i
do
not
feel
it
to
be
my
privilege
at
present
to
suggest
the
detailed
and
particular
methods
by
which
these
objects
may
be
attained
but
i
have
faith
that
the
inquiries
of
your
several
committees
will
discover
the
way
and
the
method
in
response
to
what
i
believe
to
be
the
impulse
of
sympathy
and
opinion
throughout
the
united
states
i
earnestly
suggest
that
the
congress
authorize
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
make
to
the
struggling
government
of
armenia
such
a
loan
as
was
made
to
several
of
the
allied
governments
during
the
war
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
provide
in
the
legislation
itself
that
the
expenditure
of
the
money
thus
loaned
should
be
under
the
supervision
of
a
commission
or
at
least
a
commissioner
from
the
united
states
in
order
that
revolutionary
tendencies
within
armenia
itself
might
not
be
afforded
by
the
loan
a
further
tempting
opportunity
allow
me
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
have
succeeded
in
maintaining
a
stable
government
since
the
last
action
of
the
congress
in
their
behalf
and
have
thus
fulfilled
the
condition
set
by
the
congress
as
precedent
to
a
consideration
of
granting
independence
to
the
islands
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
condition
precedent
having
been
fulfilled
it
is
now
our
liberty
and
our
duty
to
keep
our
promise
to
the
people
of
those
islands
by
granting
them
the
independence
which
they
so
honorably
covet
i
have
not
so
much
laid
before
you
a
series
of
recommendations
gentlemen
as
sought
to
utter
a
confession
of
faith
of
the
faith
in
which
i
was
bred
and
which
it
is
my
solemn
purpose
to
stand
by
until
my
last
fighting
day
i
believe
this
to
be
the
faith
of
america
the
faith
of
the
future
and
of
all
the
victories
which
await
national
action
in
the
days
to
come
whether
in
america
or
elsewhere

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
i
sincerely
regret
that
i
cannot
be
present
at
the
opening
of
this
session
of
the
congress
i
am
thus
prevented
from
presenting
in
as
direct
a
way
as
i
could
wish
the
many
questions
that
are
pressing
for
solution
at
this
time
happily
i
have
had
the
advantage
of
the
advice
of
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
who
have
kept
in
close
touch
with
affairs
in
their
detail
and
whose
thoughtful
recommendations
i
earnestly
second
in
the
matter
of
the
railroads
and
the
readjustment
of
their
affairs
growing
out
of
federal
control
i
shall
take
the
liberty
at
a
later
date
of
addressing
you
i
hope
that
congress
will
bring
to
a
conclusion
at
this
session
legislation
looking
to
the
establishment
of
a
budget
system
that
there
should
be
one
single
authority
responsible
for
the
making
of
all
appropriations
and
that
appropriations
should
be
made
not
independently
of
each
other
but
with
reference
to
one
single
comprehensive
plan
of
expenditure
properly
related
to
the
nations
income
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
believe
the
burden
of
preparing
the
budget
must
in
the
nature
of
the
case
if
the
work
is
to
be
properly
done
and
responsibility
concentrated
instead
of
divided
rest
upon
the
executive
the
budget
so
prepared
should
be
submitted
to
and
approved
or
amended
by
a
single
committee
of
each
house
of
congress
and
no
single
appropriation
should
be
made
by
the
congress
except
such
as
may
have
been
included
in
the
budget
prepared
by
the
executive
or
added
by
the
particular
committee
of
congress
charged
with
the
budget
legislation
another
and
not
less
important
aspect
of
the
problem
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
economy
and
efficiency
with
which
the
moneys
appropriated
are
expended
under
existing
law
the
only
audit
is
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
expenditures
have
been
lawfully
made
within
the
appropriations
no
one
is
authorized
or
equipped
to
ascertain
whether
the
money
has
been
spent
wisely
economically
and
effectively
the
auditors
should
be
highly
trained
officials
with
permanent
tenure
in
the
treasury
department
free
of
obligations
to
or
motives
of
consideration
for
this
or
any
subsequent
administration
and
authorized
and
empowered
to
examine
into
and
make
report
upon
the
methods
employed
and
the
results
obtained
by
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
their
reports
should
be
made
to
the
congress
and
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
i
trust
that
the
congress
will
give
its
immediate
consideration
to
the
problem
of
future
taxation
simplification
of
the
income
and
profits
taxes
has
become
an
immediate
necessity
these
taxes
performed
indispensable
service
during
the
war
they
must
however
be
simplified
not
only
to
save
the
taxpayer
inconvenience
and
expense
but
in
order
that
his
liability
may
be
made
certain
and
definite
with
reference
to
the
details
of
the
revenue
law
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
will
lay
before
you
for
your
consideration
certain
amendments
necessary
or
desirable
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
lawrecommendations
which
have
my
approval
and
support
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
in
dealing
with
this
matter
the
present
law
should
not
be
disturbed
so
far
as
regards
taxes
for
the
calendar
year
payable
in
the
calendar
year
the
congress
might
well
consider
whether
the
higher
rates
of
income
and
profits
taxes
can
in
peace
times
be
effectively
productive
of
revenue
and
whether
they
may
not
on
the
contrary
be
destructive
of
business
activity
and
productive
of
waste
and
inefficiency
there
is
a
point
at
which
in
peace
times
high
rates
of
income
and
profits
taxes
discourage
energy
remove
the
incentive
to
new
enterprises
encourage
extravagant
expenditures
and
produce
industrial
stagnation
with
consequent
unemployment
and
other
attendant
evils
the
problem
is
not
an
easy
one
a
fundamental
change
has
taken
place
with
reference
to
the
position
of
america
in
the
worlds
affairs
the
prejudice
and
passions
engendered
by
decades
of
controversy
between
two
schools
of
political
and
economic
thoughtthe
one
believers
in
protection
of
american
industries
the
other
believers
in
tariff
for
revenue
onlymust
be
subordinated
to
the
single
consideration
of
the
public
interest
in
the
light
of
utterly
changed
conditions
before
the
war
america
was
heavily
the
debtor
of
the
rest
of
the
world
and
the
interest
payments
she
had
to
make
to
foreign
countries
on
american
securities
held
abroad
the
expenditures
of
american
travelers
abroad
and
the
ocean
freight
charges
she
had
to
pay
to
others
about
balanced
the
value
of
her
prewar
favorable
balance
of
trade
during
the
war
americas
exports
have
been
greatly
stimulated
and
increased
prices
have
increased
their
value
on
the
other
hand
she
has
purchased
a
large
proportion
of
the
american
securities
previously
held
abroad
has
loaned
some
to
foreign
governments
and
has
built
her
own
ships
our
favorable
balance
of
trade
has
thus
been
greatly
increased
and
europe
has
been
deprived
of
the
means
of
meeting
it
heretofore
existing
europe
can
have
only
three
ways
of
meeting
the
favorable
balance
of
trade
in
peace
times
by
imports
into
this
country
of
gold
or
of
goods
or
by
establishing
new
credits
europe
is
in
no
position
at
the
present
time
to
ship
gold
to
us
nor
could
we
contemplate
large
further
imports
of
gold
into
this
country
without
concern
the
time
has
nearly
passed
for
international
governmental
loans
and
it
will
take
time
to
develop
in
this
country
a
market
for
foreign
securities
anything
therefore
which
would
tend
to
prevent
foreign
countries
from
settling
for
our
exports
by
shipments
of
goods
into
this
country
could
only
have
the
effect
of
preventing
them
from
paying
for
our
exports
and
therefore
of
preventing
the
exports
from
being
made
the
productivity
of
the
country
greatly
stimulated
by
the
war
must
find
an
outlet
by
exports
to
foreign
countries
and
any
measures
taken
to
prevent
imports
will
inevitably
curtail
exports
force
curtailment
of
production
load
the
banking
machinery
of
the
country
with
credits
to
carry
unsold
products
and
produce
industrial
stagnation
and
unemployment
if
we
want
to
sell
we
must
be
prepared
to
buy
whatever
therefore
may
have
been
our
views
during
the
period
of
growth
of
american
business
concerning
tariff
legislation
we
must
now
adjust
our
own
economic
life
to
a
changed
condition
growing
out
of
the
fact
that
american
business
is
full
grown
and
that
america
is
the
greatest
capitalist
in
the
world
no
policy
of
isolation
will
satisfy
the
growing
needs
and
opportunities
of
america
the
provincial
standards
and
policies
of
the
past
which
have
held
american
business
as
if
in
a
straitjacket
must
yield
and
give
way
to
the
needs
and
exigencies
of
the
new
day
in
which
we
live
a
day
full
of
hope
and
promise
for
american
business
if
we
will
but
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
are
ours
for
the
asking
the
recent
war
has
ended
our
isolation
and
thrown
upon
us
a
great
duty
and
responsibility
the
united
states
must
share
the
expanding
world
market
the
united
states
desires
for
itself
only
equal
opportunity
with
the
other
nations
of
the
world
and
that
through
the
process
of
friendly
cooperation
and
fair
competition
the
legitimate
interests
of
the
nations
concerned
may
be
successfully
and
equitably
adjusted
there
are
other
matters
of
importance
upon
which
i
urged
action
at
the
last
session
of
congress
which
are
still
pressing
for
solution
i
am
sure
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
again
to
remind
you
that
there
is
one
immediate
and
very
practicable
question
resulting
from
the
war
which
we
should
meet
in
the
most
liberal
spirit
it
is
a
matter
of
recognition
and
relief
to
our
soldiers
i
can
do
no
better
than
to
quote
from
my
last
message
urging
this
very
action
we
must
see
to
it
that
our
returning
soldiers
are
assisted
in
every
practicable
way
to
find
the
places
for
which
they
are
fitted
in
the
daily
work
of
the
country
this
can
be
done
by
developing
and
maintaining
upon
an
adequate
scale
the
admirable
organization
created
by
the
department
of
labor
for
placing
men
seeking
work
and
it
can
also
be
done
in
at
least
one
very
great
field
by
creating
new
opportunities
for
individual
enterprise
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
pointed
out
the
way
by
which
returning
soldiers
may
be
helped
to
find
and
take
up
land
in
the
hitherto
undeveloped
regions
of
the
country
which
the
federal
government
has
already
prepared
or
can
readily
prepare
for
cultivation
and
also
on
many
of
the
cutover
or
neglected
areas
which
lie
within
the
limits
of
the
older
states
and
i
once
more
take
the
liberty
of
recommending
very
urgently
that
his
plans
shall
receive
the
immediate
and
substantial
support
of
the
congress
in
the
matter
of
tariff
legislation
i
beg
to
call
your
attention
to
the
statements
contained
in
my
last
message
urging
legislation
with
reference
to
the
establishment
of
the
chemical
and
dyestuffs
industry
in
america
among
the
industries
to
which
special
consideration
should
be
given
is
that
of
the
manufacture
of
dyestuffs
and
related
chemicals
our
complete
dependence
upon
german
supplies
before
the
war
made
the
interruption
of
trade
a
cause
of
exceptional
economic
disturbance
the
close
relation
between
the
manufacture
of
dyestuffs
on
the
one
hand
and
of
explosive
and
poisonous
gases
on
the
other
moreover
has
given
the
industry
an
exceptional
significance
and
value
although
the
united
states
will
gladly
and
unhesitatingly
join
in
the
programme
of
international
disarmament
it
will
nevertheless
be
a
policy
of
obvious
prudence
to
make
certain
of
the
successful
maintenance
of
many
strong
and
wellequipped
chemical
plants
the
german
chemical
industry
with
which
we
will
be
brought
into
competition
was
and
may
well
be
again
a
thoroughly
knit
monopoly
capable
of
exercising
a
competition
of
a
peculiarly
insidious
and
dangerous
kind
during
the
war
the
farmer
performed
a
vital
and
willing
service
to
the
nation
by
materially
increasing
the
production
of
his
land
he
supplied
america
and
the
allies
with
the
incre
ased
amounts
of
food
necessary
to
keep
their
immense
armies
in
the
field
he
indispensably
helped
to
win
the
war
but
there
is
now
scarcely
less
need
of
increasing
the
production
in
food
and
the
necessaries
of
life
i
ask
the
congress
to
consider
means
of
encouraging
effort
along
these
lines
the
importance
of
doing
everything
possible
to
promote
production
along
economical
lines
to
improve
marketing
and
to
make
rural
life
more
attractive
and
healthful
is
obvious
i
would
urge
approval
of
the
plans
already
proposed
to
the
congress
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
secure
the
essential
facts
required
for
the
proper
study
of
this
question
through
the
proposed
enlarged
programmes
for
farm
management
studies
and
crop
estimates
i
would
urge
also
the
continuance
of
federal
participation
in
the
building
of
good
roads
under
the
terms
of
existing
law
and
under
the
direction
of
present
agencies
the
need
of
further
action
on
the
part
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government
to
preserve
and
develop
our
forest
resources
especially
through
the
practice
of
better
forestry
methods
on
private
holdings
and
the
extension
of
the
publicly
owned
forests
better
support
for
country
schools
and
the
more
definite
direction
of
their
courses
of
study
along
lines
related
to
rural
problems
and
fuller
provision
for
sanitation
in
rural
districts
and
the
building
up
of
needed
hospital
and
medical
facilities
in
these
localities
perhaps
the
way
might
be
cleared
for
many
of
these
desirable
reforms
by
a
fresh
comprehensive
survey
made
of
rural
conditions
by
a
conference
composed
of
representatives
of
the
farmers
and
of
the
agricultural
agencies
responsible
for
leadership
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
widespread
condition
of
political
restlessness
in
our
body
politic
the
causes
of
this
unrest
while
various
and
complicated
are
superficial
rather
than
deepseated
broadly
they
arise
from
or
are
connected
with
the
failure
on
the
part
of
our
government
to
arrive
speedily
at
a
just
and
permanent
peace
permitting
return
to
normal
conditions
from
the
transfusion
of
radical
theories
from
seething
european
centers
pending
such
delay
from
heartless
profiteering
resulting
in
the
increase
of
the
cost
of
living
and
lastly
from
the
machinations
of
passionate
and
malevolent
agitators
with
the
return
to
normal
conditions
this
unrest
will
rapidly
disappear
in
the
meantime
it
does
much
evil
it
seems
to
me
that
in
dealing
with
this
situation
congress
should
not
be
impatient
or
drastic
but
should
seek
rather
to
remove
the
causes
it
should
endeavor
to
bring
our
country
back
speedily
to
a
peace
basis
with
ameliorated
living
conditions
under
the
minimum
of
restrictions
upon
personal
liberty
that
is
consistent
with
our
reconstruction
problems
and
it
should
arm
the
federal
government
with
power
to
deal
in
its
criminal
courts
with
those
persons
who
by
violent
methods
would
abrogate
our
timetested
institutions
with
the
free
expression
of
opinion
and
with
the
advocacy
of
orderly
political
change
however
fundamental
there
must
be
no
interference
but
towards
passion
and
malevolence
tending
to
incite
crime
and
insurrection
under
guise
of
political
evolution
there
should
be
no
leniency
legislation
to
this
end
has
been
recommended
by
the
attorney
general
and
should
be
enacted
in
this
direct
connection
i
would
call
your
attention
to
my
recommendations
on
august
th
pointing
out
legislative
measures
which
would
be
effective
in
controlling
and
bringing
down
the
present
cost
of
living
which
contributes
so
largely
to
this
unrest
on
only
one
of
these
recommendations
has
the
congress
acted
if
the
governments
campaign
is
to
be
effective
it
is
necessary
that
the
other
steps
suggested
should
be
acted
on
at
once
i
renew
and
strongly
urge
the
necessity
of
the
extension
of
the
present
food
control
act
as
to
the
period
of
time
in
which
it
shall
remain
in
operation
the
attorney
general
has
submitted
a
bill
providing
for
an
extension
of
this
act
for
a
period
of
six
months
as
it
now
stands
it
is
limited
in
operation
to
the
period
of
the
war
and
becomes
inoperative
upon
the
formal
proclamation
of
peace
it
is
imperative
that
it
should
be
extended
at
once
the
department
of
justice
has
built
up
extensive
machinery
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
its
provisions
all
of
which
must
be
abandoned
upon
the
conclusion
of
peace
unless
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
extended
during
this
period
the
congress
will
have
an
opportunity
to
make
similar
permanent
provisions
and
regulations
with
regard
to
all
goods
destined
for
interstate
commerce
and
to
exclude
them
from
interstate
shipment
if
the
requirements
of
the
law
are
not
compiled
with
some
such
regulation
is
imperatively
necessary
the
abuses
that
have
grown
up
in
the
manipulation
of
prices
by
the
withholding
of
foodstuffs
and
other
necessaries
of
life
cannot
otherwise
be
effectively
prevented
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
either
the
necessity
of
the
legitimacy
of
such
measures
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
last
message
publicity
can
accomplish
a
great
deal
in
this
campaign
the
aims
of
the
government
must
be
clearly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
consuming
public
civic
organizations
and
state
officials
who
are
in
a
position
to
lend
their
assistance
to
our
efforts
you
have
made
available
funds
with
which
to
carry
on
this
campaign
but
there
is
no
provision
in
the
law
authorizing
their
expenditure
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
public
fully
informed
about
the
efforts
of
the
government
specific
recommendation
has
been
made
by
the
attorney
general
in
this
regard
i
would
strongly
urge
upon
you
its
immediate
adoption
as
it
constitutes
one
of
the
preliminary
steps
to
this
campaign
i
also
renew
my
recommendation
that
the
congress
pass
a
law
regulating
cold
storage
as
it
is
regulated
for
example
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
limit
the
time
during
which
goods
may
be
kept
in
storage
prescribe
the
method
of
disposing
of
them
if
kept
beyond
the
permitted
period
and
require
that
goods
released
from
storage
shall
in
all
cases
bear
the
date
of
their
receipt
it
would
materially
add
to
the
serviceability
of
the
law
for
the
purpose
we
now
have
in
view
if
it
were
also
prescribed
that
all
goods
released
from
storage
for
interstate
shipment
should
have
plainly
marked
upon
each
package
the
selling
or
market
price
at
which
they
went
into
storage
by
this
means
the
purchaser
would
always
be
able
to
learn
what
profits
stood
between
him
and
the
producer
or
the
wholesale
dealer
i
would
also
renew
my
recommendation
that
all
goods
destined
for
interstate
commerce
should
in
every
case
where
their
form
or
package
makes
it
possible
be
plainly
marked
with
the
price
at
which
they
left
the
hands
of
the
producer
we
should
formulate
a
law
requiring
a
federal
license
of
all
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
embodying
in
the
license
or
in
the
conditions
under
which
it
is
to
be
issued
specific
regulations
designed
to
secure
competitive
selling
and
prevent
unconscionable
profits
in
the
method
of
marketing
such
a
law
would
afford
a
welcome
opportunity
to
effect
other
much
needed
reforms
in
the
business
of
interstate
shipment
and
in
the
methods
of
corporations
which
are
engaged
in
it
but
for
the
moment
i
confine
my
recommendations
to
the
object
immediately
in
hand
which
is
to
lower
the
cost
of
living
no
one
who
has
observed
the
march
of
events
in
the
last
year
can
fail
to
note
the
absolute
need
of
a
definite
programme
to
bring
about
an
improvement
in
the
conditions
of
labor
there
can
be
no
settled
conditions
leading
to
increased
production
and
a
reduction
in
the
cost
of
living
if
labor
and
capital
are
to
be
antagonists
instead
of
partners
sound
thinking
and
an
honest
desire
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
whole
nation
as
distinguished
from
the
interests
of
a
class
must
be
applied
to
the
solution
of
this
great
and
pressing
problem
the
failure
of
other
nations
to
consider
this
matter
in
a
vigorous
way
has
produced
bitterness
and
jealousies
and
antagonisms
the
food
of
radicalism
the
only
way
to
keep
men
from
agitating
against
grievances
is
to
remove
the
grievances
an
unwillingness
even
to
discuss
these
matters
produces
only
dissatisfaction
and
gives
comfort
to
the
extreme
elements
in
our
country
which
endeavor
to
stir
up
disturbances
in
order
to
provoke
governments
to
embark
upon
a
course
of
retaliation
and
repression
the
seed
of
revolution
is
repression
the
remedy
for
these
things
must
not
be
negative
in
character
it
must
be
constructive
it
must
comprehend
the
general
interest
the
real
antidote
for
the
unrest
which
manifests
itself
is
not
suppression
but
a
deep
consideration
of
the
wrongs
that
beset
our
national
life
and
the
application
of
a
remedy
congress
has
already
shown
its
willingness
to
deal
with
these
industrial
wrongs
by
establishing
the
eighthour
day
as
the
standard
in
every
field
of
labor
it
has
sought
to
find
a
way
to
prevent
child
labor
it
has
served
the
whole
country
by
leading
the
way
in
developing
the
means
of
preserving
and
safeguarding
lives
and
health
in
dangerous
industries
it
must
now
help
in
the
difficult
task
of
finding
a
method
that
will
bring
about
a
genuine
democratization
of
industry
based
upon
the
full
recognition
of
the
right
of
those
who
work
in
whatever
rank
to
participate
in
some
organic
way
in
every
decision
which
directly
affects
their
welfare
it
is
with
this
purpose
in
mind
that
i
called
a
conference
to
meet
in
washington
on
december
st
to
consider
these
problems
in
all
their
broad
aspects
with
the
idea
of
bringing
about
a
better
understanding
between
these
two
interests
the
great
unrest
throughout
the
world
out
of
which
has
emerged
a
demand
for
an
immediate
consideration
of
the
difficulties
between
capital
and
labor
bids
us
put
our
own
house
in
order
frankly
there
can
be
no
permanent
and
lasting
settlements
between
capital
and
labor
which
do
not
recognize
the
fundamental
concepts
for
which
labor
has
been
struggling
through
the
years
the
whole
world
gave
its
recognition
and
endorsement
to
these
fundamental
purposes
in
the
league
of
notions
the
statesmen
gathere
d
at
versailles
recognized
the
fact
that
world
stability
could
not
be
had
by
reverting
to
industrial
standards
and
conditions
against
which
the
average
workman
of
the
world
had
revolted
it
is
therefore
the
task
of
the
states
men
of
this
new
day
of
change
and
readjustment
to
recognize
world
conditions
and
to
seek
to
bring
about
through
legislation
conditions
that
will
mean
the
ending
of
agelong
antagonisms
between
capital
and
labor
and
that
will
hopefully
lead
to
the
building
up
of
a
comradeship
which
will
result
not
only
in
greater
contentment
among
the
mass
of
workmen
but
also
bring
about
a
greater
production
and
a
greater
prosperity
to
business
itself
to
analyze
the
particulars
in
the
demands
of
labor
is
to
admit
the
justice
of
their
complaint
in
many
matters
that
lie
at
their
basis
the
workman
demands
an
adequate
wage
sufficient
to
permit
him
to
live
in
comfort
unhampered
by
the
fear
of
poverty
and
want
in
his
old
age
he
demands
the
right
to
live
and
the
right
to
work
amidst
sanitary
surroundings
both
in
home
and
in
workshop
surroundings
that
develop
and
do
not
retard
his
own
health
and
wellbeing
and
the
right
to
provide
for
his
childrens
wants
in
the
matter
of
health
and
education
in
other
words
it
is
his
desire
to
make
the
conditions
of
his
life
and
the
lives
of
those
dear
to
him
tolerable
and
easy
to
bear
the
establishment
of
the
principles
regarding
labor
laid
down
ill
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
offers
us
the
way
to
industrial
peace
and
conciliation
no
other
road
lies
open
to
us
not
to
pursue
this
one
is
longer
to
invite
enmities
bitterness
and
antagonisms
which
in
the
end
only
lead
to
industrial
and
social
disaster
the
unwilling
workman
is
not
a
profitable
servant
an
employee
whose
industrial
life
is
hedged
about
by
hard
and
unjust
conditions
which
he
did
not
create
and
over
which
he
has
no
control
lacks
that
fine
spirit
of
enthusiasm
and
volunteer
effort
which
are
the
necessary
ingredients
of
a
great
producing
entity
let
us
be
frank
about
this
solemn
matter
the
evidences
of
worldwide
unrest
which
manifest
themselves
in
violence
throughout
the
world
bid
us
pause
and
consider
the
means
to
be
found
to
stop
the
spread
of
this
contagious
thing
before
it
saps
the
very
vitality
of
the
nation
itself
do
we
gain
strength
by
withholding
the
remedy
or
is
it
not
the
business
of
statesmen
to
treat
these
manifestations
of
unrest
which
meet
us
on
every
hand
as
evidences
of
an
economic
disorder
and
to
apply
constructive
remedies
wherever
necessary
being
sure
that
in
the
application
of
the
remedy
we
touch
not
the
vital
tissues
of
our
industrial
and
economic
life
there
can
be
no
recession
of
the
tide
of
unrest
until
constructive
instrumentalities
are
set
up
to
stem
that
tide
governments
must
recognize
the
right
of
men
collectively
to
bargain
for
humane
objects
that
have
at
their
base
the
mutual
protection
and
welfare
of
those
engaged
in
all
industries
labor
must
not
be
longer
treated
as
a
commodity
it
must
be
regarded
as
the
activity
of
human
beings
possessed
of
deep
yearnings
and
desires
the
business
man
gives
his
best
thought
to
the
repair
and
replenishment
of
his
machinery
so
that
its
usefulness
will
not
be
impaired
and
its
power
to
produce
may
always
be
at
its
height
and
kept
in
full
vigor
and
motion
no
less
regard
ought
to
be
paid
to
the
human
machine
which
after
all
propels
the
machinery
of
the
world
and
is
the
great
dynamic
force
that
lies
back
of
all
industry
and
progress
return
to
the
old
standards
of
wage
and
industry
in
employment
are
unthinkable
the
terrible
tragedy
of
war
which
has
just
ended
and
which
has
brought
the
world
to
the
verge
of
chaos
and
disaster
would
be
in
vain
if
there
should
ensue
a
return
to
the
conditions
of
the
past
europe
itself
whence
has
come
the
unrest
which
now
holds
the
world
at
bay
is
an
example
of
standpatism
in
these
vital
human
matters
which
america
might
well
accept
as
an
example
not
to
be
followed
but
studiously
to
be
avoided
europe
made
labor
the
differential
and
the
price
of
it
all
is
enmity
and
antagonism
and
prostrated
industry
the
right
of
labor
to
live
in
peace
and
comfort
must
be
recognized
by
governments
and
america
should
be
the
first
to
lay
the
foundation
stones
upon
which
industrial
peace
shall
be
built
labor
not
only
is
entitled
to
an
adequate
wage
but
capital
should
receive
a
reasonable
return
upon
its
investment
and
is
entitled
to
protection
at
the
hands
of
the
government
in
every
emergency
no
government
worthy
of
the
name
can
play
these
elements
against
each
other
for
there
is
a
mutuality
of
interest
between
them
which
the
government
must
seek
to
express
and
to
safeguard
at
all
cost
the
right
of
individuals
to
strike
is
inviolate
and
ought
not
to
be
interfered
with
by
any
process
of
government
but
there
is
a
predominant
right
and
that
is
the
right
of
the
government
to
protect
all
of
its
people
and
to
assert
its
power
and
majesty
against
the
challenge
of
any
class
the
government
when
it
asserts
that
right
seeks
not
to
antagonize
a
class
but
simply
to
defend
the
right
of
the
whole
people
as
against
the
irreparable
harm
and
injury
that
might
be
done
by
the
attempt
by
any
class
to
usurp
a
power
that
only
government
itself
has
a
right
to
exercise
as
a
protection
to
all
in
the
matter
of
international
disputes
which
have
led
to
war
statesmen
have
sought
to
set
up
as
a
remedy
arbitration
for
war
does
this
not
point
the
way
for
the
settlement
of
industrial
disputes
by
the
establishment
of
a
tribunal
fair
and
just
alike
to
all
which
will
settle
industrial
disputes
which
in
the
past
have
led
to
war
and
disaster
america
witnessing
the
evil
consequences
which
have
followed
out
of
such
disputes
between
these
contending
forces
must
not
admit
itself
impotent
to
deal
with
these
matters
by
means
of
peaceful
processes
surely
there
must
be
some
method
of
bringing
together
in
a
council
of
peace
and
amity
these
two
great
interests
out
of
which
will
come
a
happier
day
of
peace
and
cooperation
a
day
that
will
make
men
more
hopeful
and
enthusiastic
in
their
various
tasks
that
will
make
for
more
comfort
and
happiness
in
living
and
a
more
tolerable
condition
among
all
classes
of
men
certainly
human
intelligence
can
devise
some
acceptable
tribunal
for
adjusting
the
differences
between
capital
and
labor
this
is
the
hour
of
test
and
trial
for
america
by
her
prowess
and
strength
and
the
indomitable
courage
of
her
soldiers
she
demonstrated
her
power
to
vindicate
on
foreign
battlefields
her
conceptions
of
liberty
and
justice
let
not
her
influence
as
a
mediator
between
capital
and
labor
be
weakened
and
her
own
failure
to
settle
matters
of
purely
domestic
concern
be
proclaimed
to
the
world
there
are
those
in
this
country
who
threaten
direct
action
to
force
their
will
upon
a
majority
russia
today
with
its
blood
and
terror
is
a
painful
object
lesson
of
the
power
of
minorities
it
makes
little
difference
what
minority
it
is
whether
capital
or
labor
or
any
other
class
no
sort
of
privilege
will
ever
be
permitted
to
dominate
this
country
we
are
a
partnership
or
nothing
that
is
worth
while
we
are
a
democracy
where
the
majority
are
the
masters
or
all
the
hopes
and
purposes
of
the
men
who
founded
this
government
have
been
defeated
and
forgotten
in
america
there
is
but
one
way
by
which
great
reforms
can
be
accomplished
and
the
relief
sought
by
classes
obtained
and
that
is
through
the
orderly
processes
of
representative
government
those
who
would
propose
any
other
method
of
reform
are
enemies
of
this
country
america
will
not
be
daunted
by
threats
nor
lose
her
composure
or
calmness
in
these
distressing
times
we
can
afford
in
the
midst
of
this
day
of
passion
and
unrest
to
be
selfcontained
and
sure
the
instrument
of
all
reform
in
america
is
the
ballot
the
road
to
economic
and
social
reform
in
america
is
the
straight
road
of
justice
to
all
classes
and
conditions
of
men
men
have
but
to
follow
this
road
to
realize
the
full
fruition
of
their
objects
and
purposes
let
those
beware
who
would
take
the
shorter
road
of
disorder
and
revolution
the
right
road
is
the
road
of
justice
and
orderly
process

gentlemen
of
the
congress
the
year
that
has
elapsed
since
i
last
stood
before
you
to
fulfil
my
constitutional
duty
to
give
to
the
congress
from
time
to
time
information
on
the
state
of
the
union
has
been
so
crowded
with
great
events
great
processes
and
great
results
that
i
cannot
hope
to
give
you
an
adequate
picture
of
its
transactions
or
of
the
farreaching
changes
which
have
been
wrought
of
our
nation
and
of
the
world
you
have
yourselves
witnessed
these
things
as
i
have
it
is
too
soon
to
assess
them
and
we
who
stand
in
the
midst
of
them
and
are
part
of
them
are
less
qualified
than
men
of
another
generation
will
be
to
say
what
they
mean
or
even
what
they
have
been
but
some
great
outstanding
facts
are
unmistakable
and
constitute
in
a
sense
part
of
the
public
business
with
which
it
is
our
duty
to
deal
to
state
them
is
to
set
the
stage
for
the
legislative
and
executive
action
which
must
grow
out
of
them
and
which
we
have
yet
to
shape
and
determine
a
year
ago
we
had
sent
men
overseas
since
then
we
have
sent
an
average
of
each
month
the
number
in
fact
rising
in
may
last
to
in
june
to
in
july
to
and
continuing
to
reach
similar
figures
in
august
and
september
in
august
and
in
september
no
such
movement
of
troops
ever
took
place
before
across
three
thousand
miles
of
sea
followed
by
adequate
equipment
and
supplies
and
carried
safely
through
extraordinary
dangers
of
attackdangers
which
were
alike
strange
and
infinitely
difficult
to
guard
against
in
all
this
movement
only
seven
hundred
and
fiftyeight
men
were
lost
by
enemy
attack
six
hundred
and
thirty
of
whom
were
upon
a
single
english
transport
which
was
sunk
near
the
orkney
islands
i
need
not
tell
you
what
lay
back
of
this
great
movement
of
men
and
material
it
is
not
invidious
to
say
that
back
of
it
lay
a
supporting
organization
of
the
industries
of
the
country
and
of
all
its
productive
activities
more
complete
more
thorough
in
method
and
effective
in
result
more
spirited
and
unanimous
in
purpose
and
effort
than
any
other
great
belligerent
had
been
able
to
effect
we
profited
greatly
by
the
experience
of
the
nations
which
had
already
been
engaged
for
nearly
three
years
in
the
exigent
and
exacting
business
their
every
resource
and
every
executive
proficiency
taxed
to
the
utmost
we
were
their
pupils
but
we
learned
quickly
and
acted
with
a
promptness
and
a
readiness
of
cooperation
that
justify
our
great
pride
that
we
were
able
to
serve
the
world
with
unparalleled
energy
and
quick
accomplishment
but
it
is
not
the
physical
scale
and
executive
efficiency
of
preparation
supply
equipment
and
despatch
that
i
would
dwell
upon
but
the
mettle
and
quality
of
the
officers
and
men
we
sent
over
and
of
the
sailors
who
kept
the
seas
and
the
spirit
of
the
nation
that
stood
behind
them
no
soldiers
or
sailors
ever
proved
themselves
more
quickly
ready
for
the
test
of
battle
or
acquitted
themselves
with
more
splendid
courage
and
achievement
when
put
to
the
test
those
of
us
who
played
some
part
in
directing
the
great
processes
by
which
the
war
was
pushed
irresistibly
forward
to
the
final
triumph
may
now
forget
all
that
and
delight
our
thoughts
with
the
story
of
what
our
men
did
their
officers
understood
the
grim
and
exacting
task
they
had
undertaken
and
performed
it
with
an
audacity
efficiency
and
unhesitating
courage
that
touch
the
story
of
convoy
and
battle
with
imperishable
distinction
at
every
turn
whether
the
enterprise
were
great
or
small
from
their
great
chiefs
pershing
and
sims
down
to
the
youngest
lieutenant
and
their
men
were
worthy
of
themsuch
men
as
hardly
need
to
be
commanded
and
go
to
their
terrible
adventure
blithely
and
with
the
quick
intelligence
of
those
who
know
just
what
it
is
they
would
accomplish
i
am
proud
to
be
the
fellowcountryman
of
men
of
such
stuff
and
valor
those
of
us
who
stayed
at
home
did
our
duty
the
war
could
not
have
been
won
or
the
gallant
men
who
fought
it
given
their
opportunity
to
win
it
otherwise
but
for
many
a
long
day
we
shall
think
ourselves
accursd
we
were
not
there
and
hold
our
manhoods
cheap
while
any
speaks
that
fought
with
these
at
st
mihiel
or
thierry
the
memory
of
those
days
of
triumphant
battle
will
go
with
these
fortunate
men
to
their
graves
and
each
will
have
his
favorite
memory
old
men
forget
yet
all
shall
be
forgot
but
hell
remember
with
advantages
what
feats
he
did
that
day
what
we
all
thank
god
for
with
deepest
gratitude
is
that
our
men
went
in
force
into
the
line
of
battle
just
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
whole
fate
of
the
world
seemed
to
hang
in
the
balance
and
threw
their
fresh
strength
into
the
ranks
of
freedom
in
time
to
turn
the
whole
tide
and
sweep
of
the
fateful
struggleturn
it
once
for
all
so
that
thenceforth
it
was
back
back
back
for
their
enemies
always
back
never
again
forward
after
that
it
was
only
a
scant
four
months
before
the
commanders
of
the
central
empires
knew
themselves
beaten
and
now
their
very
empires
are
in
liquidation
and
throughout
it
all
how
fine
the
spirit
of
the
nation
was
what
unity
of
purpose
what
untiring
zeal
what
elevation
of
purpose
ran
through
all
its
splendid
display
of
strength
its
untiring
accomplishment
i
have
said
that
those
of
us
who
stayed
at
home
to
do
the
work
of
organization
and
supply
will
always
wish
that
we
had
been
with
the
men
whom
we
sustained
by
our
labor
but
we
can
never
be
ashamed
it
has
been
an
inspiring
thing
to
be
here
in
the
midst
of
fine
men
who
had
turned
aside
from
every
private
interest
of
their
own
and
devoted
the
whole
of
their
trained
capacity
to
the
tasks
that
supplied
the
sinews
of
the
whole
great
undertaking
the
patriotism
the
unselfishness
the
thoroughgoing
devotion
and
distinguished
capacity
that
marked
their
toilsome
labors
day
after
day
month
after
month
have
made
them
fit
mates
and
comrades
of
the
men
in
the
trenches
and
on
the
sea
and
not
the
men
here
in
washington
only
they
have
but
directed
the
vast
achievement
throughout
innumerable
factories
upon
innumerable
farms
in
the
depths
of
coal
mines
and
iron
mines
and
copper
mines
wherever
the
stuffs
of
industry
were
to
be
obtained
and
prepared
in
the
shipyards
on
the
railways
at
the
docks
on
the
sea
in
every
labor
that
was
needed
to
sustain
the
battle
lines
men
have
vied
with
each
other
to
do
their
part
and
do
it
well
they
can
look
any
manatarms
in
the
face
and
say
we
also
strove
to
win
and
gave
the
best
that
was
in
us
to
make
our
fleets
and
armies
sure
of
their
triumph
and
what
shall
we
say
of
the
womenof
their
instant
intelligence
quickening
every
task
that
they
touched
their
capacity
for
organization
and
cooperation
which
gave
their
action
discipline
and
enhanced
the
effectiveness
of
everything
they
attempted
their
aptitude
at
tasks
to
which
they
had
never
before
set
their
hands
their
utter
selfsacrifice
alike
in
what
they
did
and
in
what
they
gave
their
contribution
to
the
great
result
is
beyond
appraisal
they
have
added
a
new
lustre
to
the
annals
of
american
womanhood
the
least
tribute
we
can
pay
them
is
to
make
them
the
equals
of
men
in
political
rights
as
they
have
proved
themselves
their
equals
in
every
field
of
practical
work
they
have
entered
whether
for
themselves
or
for
their
country
these
great
days
of
completed
achievement
would
be
sadly
marred
were
we
to
omit
that
act
of
justice
besides
the
immense
practical
services
they
have
rendered
the
women
of
the
country
have
been
the
moving
spirits
in
the
systematic
economies
by
which
our
people
have
voluntarily
assisted
to
supply
the
suffering
peoples
of
the
world
and
the
armies
upon
every
front
with
food
and
everything
else
that
we
had
that
might
serve
the
common
cause
the
details
of
such
a
story
can
never
be
fully
written
but
we
carry
them
at
our
hearts
and
thank
god
that
we
can
say
that
we
are
the
kinsmen
of
such
and
now
we
are
sure
of
the
great
triumph
for
which
every
sacrifice
was
made
it
has
come
come
in
its
completeness
and
with
the
pride
and
inspiration
of
these
days
of
achievement
quick
within
us
we
turn
to
the
tasks
of
peace
againa
peace
secure
against
the
violence
of
irresponsible
monarchs
and
ambitious
military
coteries
and
made
ready
for
a
new
order
for
new
foundations
of
justice
and
fair
dealing
we
are
about
to
give
order
and
organization
to
this
peace
not
only
for
ourselves
but
for
the
other
peoples
of
the
world
as
well
so
far
as
they
will
suffer
us
to
serve
them
it
is
international
justice
that
we
seek
not
domestic
safety
merely
our
thoughts
have
dwelt
of
late
upon
europe
upon
asia
upon
the
near
and
the
far
east
very
little
upon
the
acts
of
peace
and
accommodation
that
wait
to
be
performed
at
our
own
doors
while
we
are
adjusting
our
relations
with
the
rest
of
the
world
is
it
not
of
capital
importance
that
we
should
clear
away
all
grounds
of
misunderstanding
with
our
immediate
neighbors
and
give
proof
of
the
friendship
we
really
feel
i
hope
that
the
members
of
the
senate
will
permit
me
to
speak
once
more
of
the
unratified
treaty
of
friendship
and
adjustment
with
the
republic
of
colombia
i
very
earnestly
urge
upon
them
an
early
and
favorable
action
upon
that
vital
matter
i
believe
that
they
will
feel
with
me
that
the
stage
of
affairs
is
now
set
for
such
action
as
will
be
not
only
just
but
generous
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
new
age
upon
which
we
have
so
happily
entered
so
far
as
our
domestic
affairs
are
concerned
the
problem
of
our
return
to
peace
is
a
problem
of
economic
and
industrial
readjustment
that
problem
is
less
serious
for
us
than
it
may
turn
out
too
he
for
the
nations
which
have
suffered
the
disarrangements
and
the
losses
of
war
longer
than
we
our
people
moreover
do
not
wait
to
be
coached
and
led
they
know
their
own
business
are
quick
and
resourceful
at
every
readjustment
definite
in
purpose
and
selfreliant
in
action
any
leading
strings
we
might
seek
to
put
them
in
would
speedily
become
hopelessly
tangled
because
they
would
pay
no
attention
to
them
and
go
their
own
way
all
that
we
can
do
as
their
legislative
and
executive
servants
is
to
mediate
the
process
of
change
here
there
and
elsewhere
as
we
may
i
have
heard
much
counsel
as
to

the
plans
that
should
be
formed
and
personally
conducted
to
a
happy
consummation
but
from
no
quarter
have
i
seen
any
general
scheme
of
reconstruction
emerge
which
i
thought
it
likely
we
could
force
our
spirited
business
men
and
selfreliant
laborers
to
accept
with
due
pliancy
and
obedience
while
the
war
lasted
we
set
up
many
agencies
by
which
to
direct
the
industries
of
the
country
in
the
services
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
render
by
which
to
make
sure
of
an
abundant
supply
of
the
materials
needed
by
which
to
check
undertakings
that
could
for
the
time
be
dispensed
with
and
stimulate
those
that
were
most
serviceable
in
war
by
which
to
gain
for
the
purchasing
departments
of
the
government
a
certain
control
over
the
prices
of
essential
articles
and
materials
by
which
to
restrain
trade
with
alien
enemies
make
the
most
of
the
available
shipping
and
systematize
financial
transactions
both
public
and
private
so
that
there
would
be
no
unnecessary
conflict
or
confusionby
which
in
short
to
put
every
material
energy
of
the
country
in
harness
to
draw
the
common
load
and
make
of
us
one
team
in
the
accomplishment
of
a
great
task
but
the
moment
we
knew
the
armistice
to
have
been
signed
we
took
the
harness
off
raw
materials
upon
which
the
government
had
kept
its
hand
for
fear
there
should
not
be
enough
for
the
industries
that
supplied
the
armies
have
been
released
and
put
into
the
general
market
again
great
industrial
plants
whose
whole
output
and
machinery
had
been
taken
over
for
the
uses
of
the
government
have
been
set
free
to
return
to
the
uses
to
which
they
were
put
before
the
war
it
has
not
been
possible
to
remove
so
readily
or
so
quickly
the
control
of
foodstuffs
and
of
shipping
because
the
world
has
still
to
be
fed
from
our
granaries
and
the
ships
are
still
needed
to
send
supplies
to
our
men
overseas
and
to
bring
the
men
back
as
fast
as
the
disturbed
conditions
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
permit
but
even
there
restraints
are
being
relaxed
as
much
as
possible
and
more
and
more
as
the
weeks
go
by
never
before
have
there
been
agencies
in
existence
in
this
country
which
knew
so
much
of
the
field
of
supply
of
labor
and
of
industry
as
the
war
industries
board
the
war
trade
board
the
labor
department
the
food
administration
and
the
fuel
administration
have
known
since
their
labors
became
thoroughly
systematized
and
they
have
not
been
isolated
agencies
they
have
been
directed
by
men
who
represented
the
permanent
departments
of
the
government
and
so
have
been
the
centres
of
unified
and
cooperative
action
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
executive
therefore
since
the
armistice
was
assured
which
is
in
effect
a
complete
submission
of
the
enemy
to
put
the
knowledge
of
these
bodies
at
the
disposal
of
the
business
men
of
the
country
and
to
offer
their
intelligent
mediation
at
every
point
and
in
every
matter
where
it
was
desired
it
is
surprising
how
fast
the
process
of
return
to
a
peace
footing
has
moved
in
the
three
weeks
since
the
fighting
stopped
it
promises
to
outrun
any
inquiry
that
may
be
instituted
and
any
aid
that
may
be
offered
it
will
not
be
easy
to
direct
it
any
better
than
it
will
direct
itself
the
american
business
man
is
of
quick
initiative
the
ordinary
and
normal
processes
of
private
initiative
will
not
however
provide
immediate
employment
for
all
of
the
men
of
our
returning
armies
those
who
are
of
trained
capacity
those
who
are
skilled
workmen
those
who
have
acquired
familiarity
with
established
businesses
those
who
are
ready
and
willing
to
go
to
the
farms
all
those
whose
aptitudes
are
known
or
will
be
sought
out
by
employers
will
find
no
difficulty
it
is
safe
to
say
in
finding
place
and
employment
but
there
will
be
others
who
will
be
at
a
loss
where
to
gain
a
livelihood
unless
pains
are
taken
to
guide
them
and
put
them
in
the
way
of
work
there
will
be
a
large
floating
residuum
of
labor
which
should
not
be
left
wholly
to
shift
for
itself
it
seems
to
me
important
therefore
that
the
development
of
public
works
of
every
sort
should
be
promptly
resumed
in
order
that
opportunities
should
be
created
for
unskilled
labor
in
particular
and
that
plans
should
be
made
for
such
developments
of
our
unused
lands
and
our
natural
resources
as
we
have
hitherto
lacked
stimulation
to
undertake
i
particularly
direct
your
attention
to
the
very
practical
plans
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
developed
in
his
annual
report
and
before
your
committees
for
the
reclamation
of
arid
swamp
and
cutover
lands
which
might
if
the
states
were
willing
and
able
to
cooperate
redeem
some
three
hundred
million
acres
of
land
for
cultivation
there
are
said
to
be
fifteen
or
twenty
million
acres
of
land
in
the
west
at
present
arid
for
whose
reclamation
water
is
available
if
properly
conserved
there
are
about
two
hundred
and
thirty
million
acres
from
which
the
forests
have
been
cut
but
which
have
never
yet
been
cleared
for
the
plow
and
which
lie
waste
and
desolate
these
lie
scattered
all
over
the
union
and
there
are
nearly
eighty
million
acres
of
land
that
lie
under
swamps
or
subject
to
periodical
overflow
or
too
wet
for
anything
but
grazing
which
it
is
perfectly
feasible
to
drain
and
protect
and
redeem
the
congress
can
at
once
direct
thousands
of
the
returning
soldiers
to
the
reclamation
of
the
arid
lands
which
it
has
already
undertaken
if
it
will
but
enlarge
the
plans
and
appropriations
which
it
has
entrusted
to
the
department
of
the
interior
it
is
possible
in
dealing
with
our
unused
land
to
effect
a
great
rural
and
agricultural
development
which
will
afford
the
best
sort
of
opportunity
to
men
who
want
to
help
themselves
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
thought
the
possible
methods
out
in
a
way
which
is
worthy
of
your
most
friendly
attention
i
have
spoken
of
the
control
which
must
yet
for
a
while
perhaps
for
a
long
long
while
be
exercised
over
shipping
because
of
the
priority
of
service
to
which
our
forces
overseas
are
entitled
and
which
should
also
be
accorded
the
shipments
which
are
to
save
recently
liberated
peoples
from
starvation
and
many
devastated
regions
from
permanent
ruin
may
i
not
say
a
special
word
about
the
needs
of
belgium
and
northern
france
no
sums
of
money
paid
by
way
of
indemnity
will
serve
of
themselves
to
save
them
from
hopeless
disadvantage
for
years
to
come
something
more
must
be
done
than
merely
find
the
money
if
they
had
money
and
raw
materials
in
abundance
tomorrow
they
could
not
resume
their
place
in
the
industry
of
the
world
tomorrowthe
very
important
place
they
held
before
the
flame
of
war
swept
across
them
many
of
their
factories
are
razed
to
the
ground
much
of
their
machinery
is
destroyed
or
has
been
taken
away
their
people
are
scattered
and
many
of
their
best
workmen
are
dead
their
markets
will
be
taken
by
others
if
they
are
not
in
some
special
way
assisted
to
rebuild
their
factories
and
replace
their
lost
instruments
of
manufacture
they
should
not
be
left
to
the
vicissitudes
of
the
sharp
competition
for
materials
and
for
industrial
facilities
which
is
now
to
set
in
i
hope
therefore
that
the
congress
will
not
be
unwilling
if
it
should
become
necessary
to
grant
to
some
such
agency
as
the
war
trade
board
the
right
to
establish
priorities
of
export
and
supply
for
the
benefit
of
these
people
whom
we
have
been
so
happy
to
assist
in
saving
from
the
german
terror
and
whom
we
must
not
now
thoughtlessly
leave
to
shift
for
themselves
in
a
pitiless
competitive
market
for
the
steadying
and
facilitation
of
our
own
domestic
business
readjustments
nothing
is
more
important
than
the
immediate
determination
of
the
taxes
that
are
to
be
levied
for
and
as
much
of
the
burden
of
taxation
must
be
lifted
from
business
as
sound
methods
of
financing
the
government
will
permit
and
those
who
conduct
the
great
essential
industries
of
the
country
must
be
told
as
exactly
as
possible
what
obligations
to
the
government
they
will
be
expected
to
meet
in
the
years
immediately
ahead
of
them
it
will
be
of
serious
consequence
to
the
country
to
delay
removing
all
uncertainties
in
this
matter
a
single
day
longer
than
the
right
processes
of
debate
justify
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
successful
and
confident
business
reconstruction
before
those
uncertainties
are
resolved
if
the
war
had
continued
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
raise
at
least
eight
billion
dollars
by
taxation
payable
in
the
year
but
the
war
has
ended
and
i
agree
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
it
will
be
safe
to
reduce
the
amount
to
six
billions
an
immediate
rapid
decline
in
the
expenses
of
the
government
is
not
to
be
looked
for
contracts
made
for
war
supplies
will
indeed
be
rapidly
cancelled
and
liquidated
but
their
immediate
liquidation
will
make
heavy
drains
on
the
treasury
for
the
months
just
ahead
of
us
the
maintenance
of
our
forces
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
is
still
necessary
a
considerable
proportion
of
those
forces
must
remain
in
europe
during
the
period
of
occupation
and
those
which
are
brought
home
will
be
transported
and
demobilized
at
heavy
expense
for
months
to
come
the
interest
on
our
war
debt
must
of
course
be
paid
and
provision
made
for
the
retirement
of
the
obligations
of
the
government
which
represent
it
but
these
demands
will
of
course
fall
much
below
what
a
continuation
of
military
operations
would
have
entailed
and
six
billions
should
suffice
to
supply
a
sound
foundation
for
the
financial
operations
of
the
year
i
entirely
concur
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
recommending
that
the
two
billions
needed
in
addition
to
the
four
billions
provided
by
existing
law
be
obtained
from
the
profits
which
have
accrued
and
shall
accrue
from
war
contracts
and
distinctively
war
business
but
that
these
taxes
be
confined
to
the
war
profits
accruing
in
or
in
from
business
originating
in
war
contracts
i
urge
your
acceptance
of
his
recommendation
that
provision
be
made
now
not
subsequently
that
the
taxes
to
be
paid
in
should
be
reduced
from
six
to
four
billions
any
arrangements
less
definite
than
these
would
add
elements
of
doubt
and
confusion
to
the
critical
period
of
industrial
r
eadjustment
through
which
the
country
must
now
immediately
pass
and
which
no
true
friend
of
the
nations
essential
business
interests
can
afford
to
be
responsible
for
creating
or
prolonging
clearly
determined
conditions
clearly
and
simply
charted
are
indispensable
to
the
economic
revival
and
rapid
industrial
development
which
may
confidently
be
expected
if
we
act
now
and
sweep
all
interrogation
points
away
i
take
it
for
granted
that
the
congress
will
carry
out
the
naval
programme
which
was
undertaken
before
we
entered
the
war
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
submitted
to
your
committees
for
authorization
that
part
of
the
programme
which
covers
the
building
plans
of
the
next
three
years
these
plans
have
been
prepared
along
the
lines
and
in
accordance
with
the
policy
which
the
congress
established
not
under
the
exceptional
conditions
of
the
war
but
with
the
intention
of
adhering
to
a
definite
method
of
development
for
the
navy
i
earnestly
recommend
the
uninterrupted
pursuit
of
that
policy
it
would
clearly
be
unwise
for
us
to
attempt
to
adjust
our
programmes
to
a
future
world
policy
as
yet
undetermined
the
question
which
causes
me
the
greatest
concern
is
the
question
of
the
policy
to
be
adopted
towards
the
railroads
i
frankly
turn
to
you
for
counsel
upon
it
i
have
no
confident
judgment
of
my
own
i
do
not
see
how
any
thoughtful
man
can
have
who
knows
anything
of
the
complexity
of
the
problem
it
is
a
problem
which
must
be
studied
studied
immediately
and
studied
without
bias
or
prejudice
nothing
can
be
gained
by
becoming
partisans
of
any
particular
plan
of
settlement
it
was
necessary
that
the
administration
of
the
railways
should
be
taken
over
by
the
government
so
long
as
the
war
lasted
it
would
have
been
impossible
otherwise
to
establish
and
carry
through
under
a
single
direction
the
necessary
priorities
of
shipment
it
would
have
been
impossible
otherwise
to
combine
maximum
production
at
the
factories
and
mines
and
farms
with
the
maximum
possible
car
supply
to
take
the
products
to
the
ports
and
markets
impossible
to
route
troop
shipments
and
freight
shipments
without
regard
to
the
advantage
ordisadvantage
of
the
roads
employed
impossible
to
subordinate
when
necessary
all
questions
of
convenience
to
the
public
necessity
impossible
to
give
the
necessary
financial
support
to
the
roads
from
the
public
treasury
but
all
these
necessities
have
now
been
served
and
the
question
is
what
is
best
for
the
railroads
and
for
the
public
in
the
future
exceptional
circumstances
and
exceptional
methods
of
administration
were
not
needed
to
convince
us
that
the
railroads
were
not
equal
to
the
immense
tasks
of
transportation
imposed
upon
them
by
the
rapid
and
continuous
development
of
the
industries
of
the
country
we
knew
that
already
and
we
knew
that
they
were
unequal
to
it
partly
because
their
full
cooperation
was
rendered
impossible
by
law
and
their
competition
made
obligatory
so
that
it
has
been
impossible
to
assign
to
them
severally
the
traffic
which
could
best
be
carried
by
their
respective
lines
in
the
interest
of
expedition
and
national
economy
we
may
hope
i
believe
for
the
formal
conclusion
of
the
war
by
treaty
by
the
time
spring
has
come
the
twentyone
months
to
which
the
present
control
of
the
railways
is
limited
after
formal
proclamation
of
peace
shall
have
been
made
will
run
at
the
farthest
i
take
it
for
granted
only
to
the
january
of
the
full
equipment
of
the
railways
which
the
federal
administration
had
planned
could
not
be
completed
within
any
such
period
the
present
law
does
not
permit
the
use
of
the
revenues
of
the
several
roads
for
the
execution
of
such
plans
except
by
formal
contract
with
their
directors
some
of
whom
will
consent
while
some
will
not
and
therefore
does
not
afford
sufficient
authority
to
undertake
improvements
upon
the
scale
upon
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
undertake
them
every
approach
to
this
difficult
subjectmatter
of
decision
brings
us
face
to
face
therefore
with
this
unanswered
question
what
is
it
right
that
we
should
do
with
the
railroads
in
the
interest
of
the
public
and
in
fairness
to
their
owners
let
me
say
at
once
that
i
have
no
answer
ready
the
only
thing
that
is
perfectly
clear
to
me
is
that
it
is
not
fair
either
to
the
public
or
to
the
owners
of
the
railroads
to
leave
the
question
unanswered
and
that
it
will
presently
become
my
duty
to
relinquish
control
of
the
roads
even
before
the
expiration
of
the
statutory
period
unless
there
should
appear
some
clear
prospect
in
the
meantime
of
a
legislative
solution
their
release
would
at
least
produce
one
element
of
a
solution
namely
certainty
and
a
quick
stimulation
of
private
initiative
i
believe
that
it
will
be
serviceable
for
me
to
set
forth
as
explicitly
as
possible
the
alternative
courses
that
lie
open
to
our
choice
we
can
simply
release
the
roads
and
go
back
to
the
old
conditions
of
private
management
unrestricted
competition
and
multiform
regulation
by
both
state
and
federal
authorities
or
we
can
go
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
establish
complete
government
control
accompanied
if
necessary
by
actual
government
ownership
or
we
can
adopt
an
intermediate
course
of
modified
private
control
under
a
more
unified
and
affirmative
public
regulation
and
under
such
alterations
of
the
law
as
will
permit
wasteful
competition
to
be
avoided
and
a
considerable
degree
of
unification
of
administration
to
be
effected
as
for
example
by
regional
corporations
under
which
the
railways
of
definable
areas
would
be
in
effect
combined
in
single
systems
the
one
conclusion
that
i
am
ready
to
state
with
confidence
is
that
it
would
be
a
disservice
alike
to
the
country
and
to
the
owners
of
the
railroads
to
return
to
the
old
conditions
unmodified
those
are
conditions
of
restraint
without
development
there
is
nothing
affirmative
or
helpful
about
them
what
the
country
chiefly
needs
is
that
all
its
means
of
transportation
should
be
developed
its
railways
its
waterways
its
highways
and
its
countryside
roads
some
new
element
of
policy
therefore
is
absolutely
necessarynecessary
for
the
service
of
the
public
necessary
for
the
release
of
credit
to
those
who
are
administering
the
railways
necessary
for
the
protection
of
their
security
holders
the
old
policy
may
be
changed
much
or
little
but
surely
it
cannot
wisely
be
left
as
it
was
i
hope
that
the
con
will
have
a
complete
and
impartial
study
of
the
whole
problem
instituted
at
once
and
prosecuted
as
rapidly
as
possible
i
stand
ready
and
anxious
to
release
the
roads
from
the
present
control
and
i
must
do
so
at
a
very
early
date
if
by
waiting
until
the
statutory
limit
of
time
is
reached
i
shall
be
merely
prolonging
the
period
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
which
is
hurtful
to
every
interest
concerned
i
welcome
this
occasion
to
announce
to
the
congress
my
purpose
to
join
in
paris
the
representatives
of
the
governments
with
which
we
have
been
associated
in
the
war
against
the
central
empires
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
with
them
the
main
features
of
the
treaty
of
peace
i
realize
the
great
inconveniences
that
will
attend
my
leaving
the
country
particularly
at
this
time
but
the
conclusion
that
it
was
my
paramount
duty
to
go
has
been
forced
upon
me
by
considerations
which
i
hope
will
seem
as
conclusive
to
you
as
they
have
seemed
to
me
the
allied
governments
have
accepted
the
bases
of
peace
which
i
outlined
to
the
congress
on
the
eighth
of
january
last
as
the
central
empires
also
have
and
very
reasonably
desire
my
personal
counsel
in
their
interpretation
and
application
and
it
is
highly
desirable
that
i
should
give
it
in
order
that
the
sincere
desire
of
our
government
to
contribute
without
selfish
purpose
of
any
kind
to
settlements
that
will
be
of
common
benefit
to
all
the
nations
concerned
may
be
made
fully
manifest
the
peace
settlements
which
are
now
to
be
agreed
upon
are
of
transcendent
importance
both
to
us
and
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
know
of
no
business
or
interest
which
should
take
precedence
of
them
the
gallant
men
of
our
armed
forces
on
land
and
sea
have
consciously
fought
for
the
ideals
which
they
knew
to
be
the
ideals
of
their
country
i
have
sought
to
express
those
ideals
they
have
accepted
my
statements
of
them
as
the
substance
of
their
own
thought
and
purpose
as
the
associated
governments
have
accepted
them
i
owe
it
to
them
to
see
to
it
so
far
as
in
me
lies
that
no
false
or
mistaken
interpretation
is
put
upon
them
and
no
possible
effort
omitted
to
realize
them
it
is
now
my
duty
to
play
my
full
part
in
making
good
what
they
offered
their
lifes
blood
to
obtain
i
can
think
of
no
call
to
service
which
could
transcend
this
i
shall
be
in
close
touch
with
you
and
with
affairs
on
this
side
the
water
and
you
will
know
all
that
i
do
at
my
request
the
french
and
english
governments
have
absolutely
removed
the
censorship
of
cable
news
which
until
within
a
fortnight
they
had
maintained
and
there
is
now
no
censorship
whatever
exercised
at
this
end
except
upon
attempted
trade
communications
with
enemy
countries
it
has
been
necessary
to
keep
an
open
wire
constantly
available
between
paris
and
the
department
of
state
and
another
between
france
and
the
department
of
war
in
order
that
this
might
be
done
with
the
least
possible
interference
with
the
other
uses
of
the
cables
i
have
temporarily
taken
over
the
control
of
both
cables
in
order
that
they
may
be
used
as
a
single
system
i
did
so
at
the
advice
of
the
most
experienced
cable
officials
and
i
hope
that
the
results
will
justify
my
hope
that
the
news
of
the
next
few
months
may
pass
with
the
utmost
freedom
and
with
the
least
possible
delay
from
each
side
of
the
sea
to
the
other
may
i
not
hope
gentlemen
of
the
congress
that
in
the
delicate
tasks
i
shall
have
to
perform
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
in
my
efforts
truly
and
faithfully
to
interpret
the
principles
and
purposes
of
the
country
we
love
i
may
have
the
encouragement
and
the
added
strength
of
your
united
support
i
realize
the
magnitude
and
difficulty
of
the
duty
i
am
undertaking
i
am
poignantly
aware
of
its
grave
responsibilities
i
am
the
ser
vant
of
the
nation
i
can
have
no
private
thought
or
purpose
of
my
own
in
performing
such
an
errand
i
go
to
give
the
best
that
is
in
me
to
the
common
settlements
which
i
must
now
assist
in
arriving
at
in
conference
with
the
other
working
heads
of
the
associated
governments
i
shall
count
upon
your
friendly
countenance
and
encouragement
i
shall
not
be
inaccessible
the
cables
and
the
wireless
will
render
me
available
for
any
counsel
or
service
you
may
desire
of
me
and
i
shall
be
happy
in
the
thought
that
i
am
constantly
in
touch
with
the
weighty
matters
of
domestic
policy
with
which
we
shall
have
to
deal
i
shall
make
my
absence
as
brief
as
possible
and
shall
hope
to
return
with
the
happy
assurance
that
it
has
been
possible
to
translate
into
action
the
great
ideals
for
which
america
has
striven

gentlemen
of
the
congress
eight
months
have
elapsed
since
i
last
had
the
honor
of
addressing
you
they
have
been
months
crowded
with
events
of
immense
and
grave
significance
for
us
i
shall
not
undertake
to
detail
or
even
to
summarize
those
events
the
practical
particulars
of
the
part
we
have
played
in
them
will
be
laid
before
you
in
the
reports
of
the
executive
departments
i
shall
discuss
only
our
present
outlook
upon
these
vast
affairs
our
present
duties
and
the
immediate
means
of
accomplishing
the
objects
we
shall
hold
always
in
view
i
shall
not
go
back
to
debate
the
causes
of
the
war
the
intolerable
wrongs
done
and
planned
against
us
by
the
sinister
masters
of
germany
have
long
since
become
too
grossly
obvious
and
odious
to
every
true
american
to
need
to
be
rehearsed
but
i
shall
ask
you
to
consider
again
and
with
a
very
grave
scrutiny
our
objectives
and
the
measures
by
which
we
mean
to
attain
them
for
the
purpose
of
discussion
here
in
this
place
is
action
and
our
action
must
move
straight
toward
definite
ends
our
object
is
of
course
to
win
the
war
and
we
shall
not
slacken
or
suffer
ourselves
to
be
diverted
until
it
is
won
but
it
is
worth
while
asking
and
answering
the
question
when
shall
we
consider
the
war
won
from
one
point
of
view
it
is
not
necessary
to
broach
this
fundamental
matter
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
american
people
know
what
the
war
is
about
and
what
sort
of
an
outcome
they
will
regard
as
a
realization
of
their
purpose
in
it
as
a
nation
we
are
united
in
spirit
and
intention
i
pay
little
heed
to
those
who
tell
me
otherwise
i
hear
the
voices
of
dissentwho
does
not
i
bear
the
criticism
and
the
clamor
of
the
noisily
thoughtless
and
troublesome
i
also
see
men
here
and
there
fling
themselves
in
impotent
disloyalty
against
the
calm
indomitable
power
of
the
nation
i
hear
men
debate
peace
who
understand
neither
its
nature
nor
the
way
in
which
we
may
attain
it
with
uplifted
eyes
and
unbroken
spirits
but
i
know
that
none
of
these
speaks
for
the
nation
they
do
not
touch
the
heart
of
anything
they
may
safely
be
left
to
strut
their
uneasy
hour
and
be
forgotten
but
from
another
point
of
view
i
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
say
plainly
what
we
here
at
the
seat
of
action
consider
the
war
to
be
for
and
what
part
we
mean
to
play
in
the
settlement
of
its
searching
issues
we
are
the
spokesmen
of
the
american
people
and
they
have
a
right
to
know
whether
their
purpose
is
ours
they
desire
peace
by
the
overcoming
of
evil
by
the
defeat
once
for
all
of
the
sinister
forces
that
interrupt
peace
and
render
it
impossible
and
they
wish
to
know
how
closely
our
thought
runs
with
theirs
and
what
action
we
propose
they
are
impatient
with
those
who
desire
peace
by
any
sort
of
compromise
deeply
and
indignantly
impatientbut
they
will
be
equally
impatient
with
us
if
we
do
not
make
it
plain
to
them
what
our
objectives
are
and
what
we
are
planning
for
in
seeking
to
make
conquest
of
peace
by
arms
i
believe
that
i
speak
for
them
when
i
say
two
things
first
that
this
intolerable
thing
of
which
the
masters
of
germany
have
shown
us
the
ugly
face
this
menace
of
combined
intrigue
and
force
which
we
now
see
so
clearly
as
the
german
power
a
thing
without
conscience
or
honor
of
capacity
for
covenanted
peace
must
be
crushed
and
if
it
be
not
utterly
brought
to
an
end
at
least
shut
out
from
the
friendly
intercourse
of
the
nations
and
second
that
when
this
thing
and
its
power
are
indeed
defeated
and
the
time
comes
that
we
can
discuss
peace
when
the
german
people
have
spokesmen
whose
word
we
can
believe
and
when
those
spokesmen
are
ready
in
the
name
of
their
people
to
accept
the
common
judgment
of
the
nations
as
to
what
shall
henceforth
be
the
bases
of
law
and
of
covenant
for
the
life
of
the
worldwe
shall
be
willing
and
glad
to
pay
the
full
price
for
peace
and
pay
it
ungrudgingly
we
know
what
that
price
will
be
it
will
be
full
impartial
justicejustice
done
at
every
point
and
to
every
nation
that
the
final
settlement
must
affect
our
enemies
as
well
as
our
friends
you
catch
with
me
the
voices
of
humanity
that
are
in
the
air
they
grow
daily
more
audible
more
articulate
more
persuasive
and
they
come
from
the
hearts
of
men
everywhere
they
insist
that
the
war
shall
not
end
in
vindictive
action
of
any
kind
that
no
nation
or
people
shall
be
robbed
or
punished
because
the
irresponsible
rulers
of
a
single
country
have
themselves
done
deep
and
abominable
wrong
it
is
this
thought
that
has
been
expressed
in
the
formula
no
annexations
no
contributions
no
punitive
indemnities
just
because
this
crude
formula
expresses
the
instinctive
judgment
as
to
right
of
plain
men
everywhere
it
has
been
made
diligent
use
of
by
the
masters
of
german
intrigue
to
lead
the
people
of
russia
astray
and
the
people
of
every
other
country
their
agents
could
reachin
order
that
a
premature
peace
might
be
brought
about
before
autocracy
has
been
taught
its
final
and
convincing
lesson
and
the
people
of
the
world
put
in
control
of
their
own
destinies
but
the
fact
that
a
wrong
use
has
been
made
of
a
just
idea
is
no
reason
why
a
right
use
should
not
be
made
of
it
it
ought
to
be
brought
under
the
patronage
of
its
real
friends
let
it
be
said
again
that
autocracy
must
first
be
shown
the
utter
futility
of
its
claim
to
power
or
leadership
in
the
modern
world
it
is
impossible
to
apply
any
standard
of
justice
so
long
as
such
forces
are
unchecked
and
undefeated
as
the
present
masters
of
germany
command
not
until
that
has
been
done
can
right
be
set
up
as
arbiter
and
peacemaker
among
the
nations
but
when
that
has
been
doneas
god
willing
it
assuredly
will
bewe
shall
at
last
be
free
to
do
an
unprecedented
thing
and
this
is
the
time
to
avow
our
purpose
to
do
it
we
shall
be
free
to
base
peace
on
generosity
and
justice
to
the
exclusions
of
all
selfish
claims
to
advantage
even
on
the
part
of
the
victors
let
there
be
no
misunderstanding
our
present
and
immediate
task
is
to
win
the
war
and
nothing
shall
turn
us
aside
from
it
until
it
is
accomplished
every
power
and
resource
we
possess
whether
of
men
of
money
or
of
materials
is
being
devoted
and
will
continue
to
be
devoted
to
that
purpose
until
it
is
achieved
those
who
desire
to
bring
peace
about
before
that
purpose
is
achieved
i
counsel
to
carry
their
advice
elsewhere
we
will
not
entertain
it
we
shall
regard
the
war
as
won
only
when
the
german
people
say
to
us
through
properly
accredited
representatives
that
they
are
ready
to
agree
to
a
settlement
based
upon
justice
and
reparation
of
the
wrongs
their
rulers
have
done
they
have
done
a
wrong
to
belgium
which
must
be
repaired
they
have
established
a
power
over
other
lands
and
peoples
than
their
ownover
the
great
empire
of
austriahungary
over
hitherto
free
balkan
states
over
turkey
and
within
asiawhich
must
be
relinquished
germanys
success
by
skill
by
industry
by
knowledge
by
enterprise
we
did
not
grudge
or
oppose
but
admired
rather
she
had
built
up
for
herself
a
real
empire
of
trade
and
influence
secured
by
the
peace
of
the
world
we
were
content
to
abide
by
the
rivalries
of
manufacture
science
and
commerce
that
were
involved
for
us
in
her
success
and
stand
or
fall
as
we
had
or
did
not
have
the
brains
and
the
initiative
to
surpass
her
but
at
the
moment
when
she
had
conspicuously
won
her
triumphs
of
peace
she
threw
them
away
to
establish
in
their
stead
what
the
world
will
no
longer
permit
to
be
established
military
and
political
domination
by
arms
by
which
to
oust
where
she
could
not
excel
the
rivals
she
most
feared
and
hated
the
peace
we
make
must
remedy
that
wrong
it
must
deliver
the
once
fair
lands
and
happy
peoples
of
belgium
and
northern
france
from
the
prussian
conquest
and
the
prussian
menace
but
it
must
deliver
also
the
peoples
of
austriahungary
the
peoples
of
the
balkans
and
the
peoples
of
turkey
alike
in
europe
and
asia
from
the
impudent
and
alien
dominion
of
the
prussian
military
and
commercial
autocracy
we
owe
it
however
to
ourselves
to
say
that
we
do
not
wish
in
any
way
to
impair
or
to
rearrange
the
austrohungarian
empire
it
is
no
affair
of
ours
what
they
do
with
their
own
life
either
industrially
or
politically
we
do
not
purpose
or
desire
to
dictate
to
them
in
any
way
we
only
desire
to
see
that
their
affairs
are
left
in
their
own
hands
in
all
matters
great
or
small
we
shall
hope
to
secure
for
the
peoples
of
the
balkan
peninsula
and
for
the
people
of
the
turkish
empire
the
right
and
opportunity
to
make
their
own
lives
safe
their
own
fortunes
secure
against
oppression
or
injustice
and
from
the
dictation
of
foreign
courts
or
parties
and
our
attitude
and
purpose
with
regard
to
germany
herself
are
of
a
like
kind
we
intend
no
wrong
against
the
german
empire
no
interference
with
her
internal
affairs
we
should
deem
either
the
one
or
the
other
absolutely
unjustifiable
absolutely
contrary
to
the
principles
we
have
professed
to
live
by
and
to
hold
most
sacred
throughout
our
life
as
a
nation
the
people
of
germany
are
being
told
by
the
men
whom
they
now
permit
to
deceive
them
and
to
act
as
their
masters
that
they
are
fighting
for
the
very
life
and
existence
of
their
empire
a
war
of
desperate
selfdefense
against
deliberate
aggression
nothing
could
be
more
grossly
or
wantonly
false
and
we
must
seek
by
the
utmost
openness
and
candor
as
to
our
real
aims
to
convince
them
of
its
falseness
we
are
in
fact
fighting
for
their
emancipation
from
the
fear
along
with
our
ownfrom
the
fear
as
well
as
from
the
fact
of
unjust
attack
by
neighbors
or
rivals
or
schemers
after
world
empire
no
one
is
threatening
the
existence
or
the
independence
of
the
peaceful
enterprise
of
the
german
empire
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
the
detriment
the
german
people
is
this
that
if
they
should
still
after
the
war
is
over
continue
to
be
obliged
to
live
under
ambitious
and
intriguing
masters
interested
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
world
men
or
classes
of
men
whom
the
other
peoples
of
the
world
could
not
trust
it
might
be
impossible
to
admit
them
to
the
partnership
of
nations
which
must
henceforth
guarantee
the
worlds
peace
that
partnership
must
be
a
partne
rship
of
peoples
not
a
mere
partnership
of
governments
it
might
be
impossible
also
in
such
untoward
circumstances
to
admit
germany
to
the
free
economic
intercourse
which
must
inevitably
spring
out
of
the
other
partnerships
of
a
real
peace
but
there
would
be
no
aggression
in
that
and
such
a
situation
inevitable
because
of
distrust
would
in
the
very
nature
of
things
sooner
or
later
cure
itself
by
processes
which
would
assuredly
set
in
the
wrongs
the
very
deep
wrongs
committed
in
this
war
will
have
to
be
righted
that
of
course
but
they
cannot
and
must
not
be
righted
by
the
commission
of
similar
wrongs
against
germany
and
her
allies
the
world
will
not
permit
the
commission
of
similar
wrongs
as
a
means
of
reparation
and
settlement
statesmen
must
by
this
time
have
learned
that
the
opinion
of
the
world
is
everywhere
wide
awake
and
fully
comprehends
the
issues
involved
no
representative
of
any
selfgoverned
nation
will
dare
disregard
it
by
attempting
any
such
covenants
of
selfishness
and
compromise
as
were
entered
into
at
the
congress
of
vienna
the
thought
of
the
plain
people
here
and
everywhere
throughout
the
world
the
people
who
enjoy
no
privilege
and
have
very
simple
and
unsophisticated
standards
of
right
and
wrong
is
the
air
all
governments
must
henceforth
breathe
if
they
would
live
it
is
in
the
full
disclosing
light
of
that
thought
that
all
policies
must
be
received
and
executed
in
this
midday
hour
of
the
worlds
life
ger
man
rulers
have
been
able
to
upset
the
peace
of
the
world
only
because
the
german
people
were
not
suffered
under
their
tutelage
to
share
the
comradeship
of
the
other
peoples
of
the
world
either
in
thought
or
in
purpose
they
were
allowed
to
have
no
opinion
of
their
own
which
might
be
set
up
as
a
rule
of
conduct
for
those
who
exercised
authority
over
them
but
the
congress
that
concludes
this
war
will
feel
the
full
strength
of
the
tides
that
run
now
in
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
free
men
everywhere
its
conclusions
will
run
with
those
tides
all
those
things
have
been
true
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
stupendous
war
and
i
cannot
help
thinking
that
if
they
had
been
made
plain
at
the
very
outset
the
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
of
the
russian
people
might
have
been
once
for
all
enlisted
on
the
side
of
the
allies
suspicion
and
distrust
swept
away
and
a
real
and
lasting
union
of
purpose
effected
had
they
believed
these
things
at
the
very
moment
of
their
revolution
and
had
they
been
confirmed
in
that
belief
since
the
sad
reverses
which
have
recently
marked
the
progress
of
their
affairs
towards
an
ordered
and
stable
government
of
free
men
might
have
been
avoided
the
russian
people
have
been
poisoned
by
the
very
same
falsehoods
that
have
kept
the
german
people
in
the
dark
and
the
poison
has
been
administered
by
the
very
same
hand
the
only
possible
antidote
is
the
truth
it
cannot
be
uttered
too
plainly
or
too
often
from
every
point
of
view
therefore
it
has
seemed
to
be
my
duty
to
speak
these
declarations
of
purpose
to
add
these
specific
interpretations
to
what
i
took
the
liberty
of
saying
to
the
senate
in
january
our
entrance
into
the
war
has
not
altered
out
attitude
towards
the
settlement
that
must
come
when
it
is
over
when
i
said
in
january
that
the
nations
of
the
world
were
entitled
not
only
to
free
pathways
upon
the
sea
but
also
to
assured
and
unmolested
access
to
thosepathways
i
was
thinking
and
i
am
thinking
now
not
of
the
smaller
and
weaker
nations
alone
which
need
our
countenance
and
support
but
also
of
the
great
and
powerful
nations
and
of
our
present
enemies
as
well
as
our
present
associates
in
the
war
i
was
thinking
and
am
thinking
now
of
austria
herself
among
the
rest
as
well
as
of
serbia
and
of
poland
justice
and
equality
of
rights
can
be
had
only
at
a
great
price
we
are
seeking
permanent
not
temporary
foundations
for
the
peace
of
the
world
and
must
seek
them
candidly
and
fearlessly
as
always
the
right
will
prove
to
be
the
expedient
what
shall
we
do
then
to
push
this
great
war
of
freedom
and
justice
to
its
righteous
conclusion
we
must
clear
away
with
a
thorough
hand
all
impediments
to
success
and
we
must
make
every
adjustment
of
law
that
will
facilitate
the
full
and
free
use
of
our
whole
capacity
and
force
as
a
fighting
unit
one
very
embarrassing
obstacle
that
stands
hi
our
way
is
that
we
are
at
war
with
germany
but
not
with
her
allies
i
therefore
very
earnestly
recommend
that
the
congress
immediately
declare
the
united
states
in
a
state
of
war
with
austriahungary
does
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
this
should
be
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
i
have
just
addressed
to
you
it
is
not
it
is
in
fact
the
inevitable
logic
of
what
i
have
said
austriahungary
is
for
the
time
being
not
her
own
mistress
but
simply
the
vassal
of
the
german
government
we
must
face
the
facts
as
they
are
and
act
upon
them
without
sentiment
in
this
stern
business
the
government
of
austria
and
hungary
is
not
acting
upon
its
own
initiative
or
in
response
to
the
wishes
and
feelings
of
its
own
peoples
but
as
the
instrument
of
another
nation
we
must
meet
its
force
with
our
own
and
regard
the
central
powers
as
but
one
the
war
can
be
successfully
conducted
in
no
other
way
the
same
logic
would
lead
also
to
a
declaration
of
war
against
turkey
and
bulgaria
they
also
are
the
tools
of
germany
but
they
are
mere
tools
and
do
not
yet
stand
in
the
direct
path
of
our
necessary
action
we
shall
go
wherever
the
necessities
of
this
war
carry
us
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
go
only
where
immediate
and
practical
considerations
lead
us
and
not
heed
any
others
the
financial
and
military
measures
which
must
be
adopted
will
suggest
themselves
as
the
war
and
its
undertakings
develop
but
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
proposing
to
you
certain
other
acts
of
legislation
which
seem
to
me
to
be
needed
for
the
support
of
the
war
and
for
the
release
of
our
whole
force
and
energy
it
will
be
necessary
to
extend
in
certain
particulars
the
legislation
of
the
last
session
with
regard
to
alien
enemies
and
also
necessary
i
believe
to
create
a
very
definite
and
particular
control
over
the
entrance
and
departure
of
all
persons
into
and
from
the
united
states
legislation
should
be
enacted
defining
as
a
criminal
offense
every
wilful
violation
of
the
presidential
proclamation
relating
to
alien
enemies
promulgated
under
section
o
of
the
revised
statutes
and
providing
appropriate
punishments
and
women
as
well
as
men
should
be
included
under
the
terms
of
the
acts
placing
restraints
upon
alien
enemies
it
is
likely
that
as
time
goes
on
many
alien
enemies
will
be
willing
to
be
fed
and
housed
at
the
expense
of
the
government
in
the
detention
camps
and
it
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
i
have
suggested
to
confine
offenders
among
them
in
the
penitentiaries
and
other
similar
institutions
where
they
could
be
made
to
work
as
other
criminals
do
recent
experience
has
convinced
me
that
the
congress
must
go
further
in
authorizing
the
government
to
set
limits
to
prices
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
i
am
sorry
to
say
has
been
replaced
by
the
law
of
unrestrained
selfishness
while
we
have
eliminated
profiteering
in
several
branches
of
industry
it
still
runs
impudently
rampant
in
others
the
farmers
for
example
complain
with
a
great
deal
of
justice
that
while
the
regulation
of
food
prices
restricts
their
incomes
no
restraints
are
placed
upon
the
prices
of
most
of
the
things
they
must
themselves
purchase
and
similar
inequities
obtain
on
all
sides
it
is
imperatively
necessary
that
the
consideration
of
the
full
use
of
the
water
power
of
the
country
and
also
of
the
consideration
of
the
systematic
and
yet
economical
development
of
such
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
as
are
still
under
the
control
of
the
federal
government
should
be
immediately
resumed
and
affirmatively
and
constructively
dealt
with
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
pressing
need
of
such
legislation
is
daily
becoming
more
obvious
the
legislation
proposed
at
the
last
session
with
regard
to
regulated
combinations
among
our
exporters
in
order
to
provide
for
our
foreign
trade
a
more
effective
organization
and
method
of
cooperation
ought
by
all
means
to
be
completed
at
this
session
and
i
beg
that
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
will
permit
me
to
express
the
opinion
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
deal
in
any
but
a
very
wasteful
and
extravagant
fashion
with
the
enormous
appropriations
of
the
public
moneys
which
must
continue
to
be
made
if
the
war
is
to
be
properly
sustained
unless
the
house
will
consent
to
return
to
its
former
practice
of
initiating
and
preparing
all
appropriation
bills
through
a
single
committee
in
order
that
responsibility
may
be
centered
expenditures
standardized
and
made
uniform
and
waste
and
duplication
as
much
as
possible
avoided
additional
legislation
may
also
become
necessary
before
the
present
congress
again
adjourns
in
order
to
effect
the
most
efficient
coordination
and
operation
of
the
railways
and
other
transportation
systems
of
the
country
but
to
that
i
shall
if
circumstances
should
demand
call
the
attention
of
congress
upon
another
occasion
if
i
have
overlooked
anything
that
ought
to
be
done
for
the
more
effective
conduct
of
the
war
your
own
counsels
will
supply
the
omission
what
i
am
perfectly
clear
about
is
that
in
the
present
session
of
the
congress
our
whole
attention
and
energy
should
be
concentrated
on
the
vigorous
rapid
and
successful
prosecution
of
the
great
task
of
winning
the
war
we
can
do
this
with
all
the
greater
zeal
and
enthusiasm
because
we
know
that
for
us
this
is
a
war
of
high
principle
debased
by
no
selfish
ambition
of
conquest
or
spoliation
because
we
know
and
all
the
world
knows
that
we
have
been
forced
into
it
to
save
the
very
institutions
we
five
under
from
corruption
and
destruction
the
purpose
of
the
central
powers
strikes
straight
at
the
very
heart
of
everything
we
believe
in
their
methods
of
warfare
outrage
every
principle
of
humanity
and
of
knightly
honor
their
intrigue
has
corrupted
the
very
thought
and
spirit
of
many
of
our
people
their
sinister
and
sec
ret
diplomacy
has
sought
to
take
our
very
territory
away
from
us
and
disrupt
the
union
of
the
states
our
safety
would
be
at
an
end
our
honor
forever
sullied
and
brought
into
contempt
were
we
to
permit
their
triumph
they
are
striking
at
the
very
existence
of
democracy
and
liberty
it
is
because
it
is
for
us
a
war
of
high
disinterested
purpose
in
which
all
the
free
peoples
of
the
world
are
banded
together
for
the
vindication
of
right
a
war
for
the
preservation
of
our
nation
of
all
that
it
has
held
dear
of
principle
and
of
purpose
that
we
feel
ourselves
doubly
constrained
to
propose
for
its
outcome
only
that
which
is
righteous
and
of
irreproachable
intention
for
our
foes
as
well
as
for
our
friends
the
cause
being
just
and
holy
the
settlement
must
be
of
like
motive
and
equality
for
this
we
can
fight
but
for
nothing
less
noble
or
less
worthy
of
our
traditions
for
this
cause
we
entered
the
war
and
for
this
cause
will
we
battle
until
the
last
gun
is
fired
i
have
spoken
plainly
because
this
seems
to
me
the
time
when
it
is
most
necessary
to
speak
plainly
in
order
that
all
the
world
may
know
that
even
in
the
heat
and
ardor
of
the
struggle
and
when
our
whole
thought
is
of
carrying
the
war
through
to
its
end
we
have
not
forgotten
any
ideal
or
principle
for
which
the
name
of
america
has
been
held
in
honor
among
the
nations
and
for
which
it
has
been
our
glory
to
contend
in
the
great
generations
that
went
before
us
a
supreme
moment
of
history
has
come
the
eyes
of
the
people
have
been
opened
and
they
see
the
hand
of
god
is
laid
upon
the
nations
he
will
show
them
favor
i
devoutly
believe
only
if
they
rise
to
the
clear
heights
of
his
own
justice
and
mercy

gentlemen
of
the
congress
in
fulfilling
at
this
time
the
duty
laid
upon
me
by
the
constitution
of
communicating
to
you
from
time
to
time
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommending
to
your
consideration
such
legislative
measures
as
may
be
judged
necessary
and
expedient
i
shall
continue
the
practice
which
i
hope
has
been
acceptable
to
you
of
leaving
to
the
reports
of
the
several
heads
of
the
executive
departments
the
elaboration
of
the
detailed
needs
of
the
public
service
and
confine
myself
to
those
matters
of
more
general
public
policy
with
which
it
seems
necessary
and
feasible
to
deal
at
the
present
session
of
the
congress
i
realize
the
limitations
of
time
under
which
you
will
necessarily
act
at
this
session
and
shall
make
my
suggestions
as
few
as
possible
but
there
were
some
things
left
undone
at
the
last
session
which
there
will
now
be
time
to
complete
and
which
it
seems
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
public
to
do
at
once
in
the
first
place
it
seems
to
me
imperatively
necessary
that
the
earliest
possible
consideration
and
action
should
be
accorded
the
remaining
measures
of
the
program
of
settlement
and
regulation
which
i
had
occasion
to
recommend
to
you
at
the
close
of
your
last
session
in
view
of
the
public
dangers
disclosed
by
the
unaccommodated
difficulties
which
then
existed
and
which
still
unhappily
continue
to
exist
between
the
railroads
of
the
country
and
their
locomotive
engineers
conductors
and
trainmen
i
then
recommended
first
immediate
provision
for
the
enlargement
and
administrative
reorganization
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
along
the
lines
embodied
in
the
bill
recently
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives
and
now
awaiting
action
by
the
senate
in
order
that
the
commission
may
be
enabled
to
deal
with
the
many
great
and
various
duties
now
devolving
upon
it
with
a
promptness
and
thoroughness
which
are
with
its
present
constitution
and
means
of
action
practically
impossible
second
the
establishment
of
an
eighthour
day
as
the
legal
basis
alike
of
work
and
wages
in
the
employment
of
all
railway
employes
who
are
actually
engaged
in
the
work
of
operating
trains
in
interstate
transportation
third
the
authorization
of
the
appointment
by
the
president
of
a
small
body
of
men
to
observe
actual
results
in
experience
of
the
adoption
of
the
eighthour
day
in
railway
transportation
alike
for
the
men
and
for
the
railroads
fourth
explicit
approval
by
the
congress
of
the
consideration
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
an
increase
of
freight
rates
to
meet
such
additional
expenditures
by
the
railroads
as
may
have
been
rendered
necessary
by
the
adoption
of
the
eighthour
day
and
which
have
not
been
offset
by
administrative
readjustments
and
economies
should
the
facts
disclosed
justify
the
increase
fifth
an
amendment
of
the
existing
federal
statute
which
provides
for
the
mediation
conciliation
and
arbitration
of
such
controversies
as
the
present
by
adding
to
it
a
provision
that
in
case
the
methods
of
accommodation
now
provided
for
should
fail
a
full
public
investigation
of
the
merits
of
every
such
dispute
shall
be
instituted
and
completed
before
a
strike
or
lockout
may
lawfully
be
attempted
and
sixth
the
lodgment
in
the
hands
of
the
executive
of
the
power
in
case
of
military
necessity
to
take
control
of
such
portions
and
such
rolling
stock
of
the
railways
of
the
country
as
may
be
required
for
military
use
and
to
operate
them
for
military
purposes
with
authority
to
draft
into
the
military
service
of
the
united
states
such
train
crews
and
administrative
officials
as
the
circumstances
require
for
their
safe
and
efficient
use
the
second
and
third
of
these
recommendations
the
congress
immediately
acted
on
it
established
the
eighthour
day
as
the
legal
basis
of
work
and
wages
in
train
service
and
it
authorized
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
observe
and
report
upon
the
practical
results
deeming
these
the
measures
most
immediately
needed
but
it
postponed
action
upon
the
other
suggestions
until
an
opportunity
should
be
offered
for
a
more
deliberate
consideration
of
them
the
fourth
recommendation
i
do
not
deem
it
necessary
to
renew
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
grant
an
increase
of
rates
on
the
ground
referred
to
is
indisputably
clear
and
a
recommendation
by
the
congress
with
regard
to
such
a
matter
might
seem
to
draw
in
question
the
scope
of
the
commissions
authority
or
its
inclination
to
do
justice
when
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
either
the
other
suggestionsthe
increase
in
the
interstate
commerce
commissions
membership
and
in
its
facilities
for
performing
its
manifold
duties
the
provision
for
full
public
investigation
and
assessment
of
industrial
disputes
and
the
grant
to
the
executive
of
the
power
to
control
and
operate
the
railways
when
necessary
in
time
of
war
or
other
like
public
necessityi
now
very
earnestly
renew
the
necessity
for
such
legislation
is
manifest
and
pressing
those
who
have
entrusted
us
with
the
responsibility
and
duty
of
serving
and
safeguarding
them
in
such
matters
would
find
it
hard
i
believe
to
excuse
a
failure
to
act
upon
these
grave
matters
or
any
unnecessary
postponement
of
action
upon
them
not
only
does
the
interstate
commerce
commission
now
find
it
practically
impossible
with
its
present
membership
and
organization
to
perform
its
great
functions
promptly
and
thoroughly
but
it
is
not
unlikely
that
it
may
presently
be
found
advisable
to
add
to
its
duties
still
others
equally
heavy
and
exacting
it
must
first
be
perfected
as
an
administrative
instrument
the
country
cannot
and
should
not
consent
to
remain
any
longer
exposed
to
profound
industrial
disturbances
for
lack
of
additional
means
of
arbitration
and
conciliation
which
the
congress
can
easily
and
promptly
supply
and
all
will
agree
that
there
must
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
the
executive
to
make
immediate
and
uninterrupted
use
of
the
railroads
for
the
concentration
of
the
military
forces
of
the
nation
wherever
they
are
needed
and
whenever
they
are
needed
this
is
a
program
of
regulation
prevention
and
administrative
efficiency
which
argues
its
own
case
in
the
mere
statement
of
it
with
regard
to
one
of
its
items
the
increase
in
the
efficiency
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
house
of
representatives
has
already
acted
its
action
needs
only
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
i
would
hesitate
to
recommend
and
i
dare
say
the
congress
would
hesitate
to
act
upon
the
suggestion
should
i
make
it
that
any
man
in
any
i
occupation
should
be
obliged
by
law
to
continue
in
an
employment
which
he
desired
to
leave
to
pass
a
law
which
forbade
or
prevented
the
individual
workman
to
leave
his
work
before
receiving
the
approval
of
society
in
doing
so
would
be
to
adopt
a
new
principle
into
our
jurisprudence
which
i
take
it
for
granted
we
are
not
prepared
to
introduce
but
the
proposal
that
the
operation
of
the
railways
of
the
country
shall
not
be
stopped
or
interrupted
by
the
concerted
action
of
organized
bodies
of
men
until
a
public
investigation
shall
have
been
instituted
which
shall
make
the
whole
question
at
issue
plain
for
the
judgment
of
the
opinion
of
the
nation
is
not
to
propose
any
such
principle
it
is
based
upon
the
very
different
principle
that
the
concerted
action
of
powerful
bodies
of
men
shall
not
be
permitted
to
stop
the
industrial
processes
of
the
nation
at
any
rate
before
the
nation
shall
have
had
an
opportunity
to
acquaint
itself
with
the
merits
of
the
case
as
between
employe
and
employer
time
to
form
its
opinion
upon
an
impartial
statement
of
the
merits
and
opportunity
to
consider
all
practicable
means
of
conciliation
or
arbitration
i
can
see
nothing
in
that
proposition
but
the
justifiable
safeguarding
by
society
of
the
necessary
processes
of
its
very
life
there
is
nothing
arbitrary
or
unjust
in
it
unless
it
be
arbitrarily
and
unjustly
done
it
can
and
should
be
done
with
a
full
and
scrupulous
regard
for
the
interests
and
liberties
of
all
concerned
as
well
as
for
the
permanent
interests
of
society
itself
three
matters
of
capital
importance
await
the
action
of
the
senate
which
have
already
been
acted
upon
by
the
house
of
representatives
the
bill
which
seeks
to
extend
greater
freedom
of
combination
to
those
engaged
in
promoting
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
country
than
is
now
thought
by
some
to
be
legal
under
the
terms
of
the
laws
against
monopoly
the
bill
amending
the
present
organic
law
of
porto
rico
and
the
bill
proposing
a
more
thorough
and
systematic
regulation
of
the
expenditure
of
money
in
elections
commonly
called
the
corrupt
practices
act
i
need
not
labor
my
advice
that
these
measures
be
enacted
into
law
their
urgency
lies
in
the
manifest
circumstances
which
render
their
adoption
at
this
time
not
only
opportune
but
necessary
even
delay
would
seriously
jeopard
the
interests
of
the
country
and
of
the
government
immediate
passage
of
the
bill
to
regulate
the
expenditure
of
money
in
elections
may
seem
to
be
less
necessary
than
the
immediate
enactment
of
the
other
measures
to
which
i
refer
because
at
least
two
years
will
elapse
before
another
election
in
which
federal
offices
are
to
be
filled
but
it
would
greatly
relieve
the
public
mind
if
this
important
matter
were
dealt
with
while
the
circumstances
and
the
dangers
to
the
public
morals
of
the
present
method
of
obtaining
and
spending
campaign
funds
stand
clear
under
recent
observation
and
the
methods
of
expenditure
can
be
frankly
studied
in
the
light
of
present
experience
and
a
delay
would
have
the
further
very
serious
disadvantage
of
postponing
action
until
another
election
was
at
hand
and
some
special
object
connected
with
it
might
be
thought
to
be
in
the
mind
of
those
who
urged
it
action
can
be
taken
now
with
facts
for
guidance
and
without
suspicion
of
partisan
purpose
i
shall
not
argue
at
length
the
desirability
of
giving
a
freer
hand
in
the
matter
of
combined
and
concerted
effort
to
those
who
shall
undertake
the
essential
enterprise
of
building
up
our
export
trade
that
enterprise
will
presently
will
immediately
assume
has
indeed
already

assumed
a
magnitude
unprecedented
in
our
experience
we
have
not
the
necessary
instrumentalities
for
its
prosecution
it
is
deemed
to
be
doubtful
whether
they
could
be
created
upon
an
adequate
scale
under
our
present
laws
we
should
clear
away
all
legal
obstacles
and
create
a
basis
of
undoubted
law
for
it
which
will
give
freedom
without
permitting
unregulated
license
the
thing
must
be
done
now
because
the
opportunity
is
here
and
may
escape
us
if
we
hesitate
or
delay
the
argument
for
the
proposed
amendments
of
the
organic
law
of
porto
rico
is
brief
and
conclusive
the
present
laws
governing
the
island
and
regulating
the
rights
and
privileges
of
its
people
are
not
just
we
have
created
expectations
of
extended
privilege
which
we
have
not
satisfied
there
is
uneasiness
among
the
people
of
the
island
and
even
a
suspicious
doubt
with
regard
to
our
intentions
concerning
them
which
the
adoption
of
the
pending
measure
would
happily
remove
we
do
not
doubt
what
we
wish
to
do
in
any
essential
particular
we
ought
to
do
it
at
once
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
a
bill
was
passed
by
the
senate
which
provides
for
the
promotion
of
vocational
and
industrial
education
which
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
whole
country
because
it
concerns
a
matter
too
long
neglected
upon
which
the
thorough
industrial
preparation
of
the
country
for
the
critical
years
of
economic
development
immediately
ahead
of
us
in
very
large
measure
depends
may
i
not
urge
its
early
and
favorable
consideration
by
the
house
of
representatives
and
its
early
enactment
into
law
it
contains
plans
which
affect
all
interests
and
all
parts
of
the
country
and
i
am
sure
that
there
is
no
legislation
now
pending
before
the
congress
whose
passage
the
country
awaits
with
more
thoughtful
approval
or
greater
impatience
to
see
a
great
and
admirable
thing
set
in
the
way
of
being
done
there
are
other
matters
already
advanced
to
the
stage
of
conference
between
the
two
houses
of
which
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
speak
some
practicable
basis
of
agreement
concerning
them
will
no
doubt
be
found
an
action
taken
upon
them
inasmuch
as
this
is
gentlemen
probably
the
last
occasion
i
shall
have
to
address
the
sixtyfourth
congress
i
hope
that
you
will
permit
me
to
say
with
what
genuine
pleasure
and
satisfaction
i
have
cooperated
with
you
in
the
many
measures
of
constructive
policy
with
which
you
have
enriched
the
legislative
annals
of
the
country
it
has
been
a
privilege
to
labor
in
such
company
i
take
the
liberty
of
congratulating
you
upon
the
completion
of
a
record
of
rare
serviceableness
and
distinction

gentlemen
of
the
congress
since
i
last
had
the
privilege
of
addressing
you
on
the
state
of
the
union
the
war
of
nations
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
which
had
then
only
begun
to
disclose
its
portentous
proportions
has
extended
its
threatening
and
sinister
scope
until
it
has
swept
within
its
flame
some
portion
of
every
quarter
of
the
globe
not
excepting
our
own
hemisphere
has
altered
the
whole
face
of
international
affairs
and
now
presents
a
prospect
of
reorganization
and
reconstruction
such
as
statesmen
and
peoples
have
never
been
called
upon
to
attempt
before
we
have
stood
apart
studiously
neutral
it
was
our
manifest
duty
to
do
so
not
only
did
we
have
no
part
or
interest
in
the
policies
which
seem
to
have
brought
the
conflict
on
it
was
necessary
if
a
universal
catastrophe
was
to
be
avoided
that
a
limit
should
be
set
to
the
sweep
of
destructive
war
and
that
some
part
of
the
great
family
of
nations
should
keep
the
processes
of
peace
alive
if
only
to
prevent
collective
economic
ruin
and
the
breakdown
throughout
the
world
of
the
industries
by
which
its
populations
are
fed
and
sustained
it
was
manifestly
the
duty
of
the
selfgoverned
nations
of
this
hemisphere
to
redress
if
possible
the
balance
of
economic
loss
and
confusion
in
the
other
if
they
could
do
nothing
more
in
the
day
of
readjustment
and
recuperation
we
earnestly
hope
and
believe
that
they
can
be
of
infinite
service
in
this
neutrality
to
which
they
were
bidden
not
only
by
their
separate
life
and
their
habitual
detachment
from
the
politics
of
europe
but
also
by
a
clear
perception
of
international
duty
the
states
of
america
have
become
conscious
of
a
new
and
more
vital
community
of
interest
and
moral
partnership
in
affairs
more
clearly
conscious
of
the
many
common
sympathies
and
interests
and
duties
which
bid
them
stand
together
there
was
a
time
in
the
early
days
of
our
own
great
nation
and
of
the
republics
fighting
their
way
to
independence
in
central
and
south
america
when
the
government
of
the
united
states
looked
upon
itself
as
in
some
sort
the
guardian
of
the
republics
to
the
south
of
her
as
against
any
encroachments
or
efforts
at
political
control
from
the
other
side
of
the
water
felt
it
its
duty
to
play
the
part
even
without
invitation
from
them
and
i
think
that
we
can
claim
that
the
task
was
undertaken
with
a
true
and
disinterested
enthusiasm
for
the
freedom
of
the
americas
and
the
unmolested
selfgovernment
of
her
independent
peoples
but
it
was
always
difficult
to
maintain
such
a
role
without
offense
to
the
pride
of
the
peoples
whose
freedom
of
action
we
sought
to
protect
and
without
provoking
serious
misconceptions
of
our
motives
and
every
thoughtful
man
of
affairs
must
welcome
the
altered
circumstances
of
the
new
day
in
whose
light
we
now
stand
when
there
is
no
claim
of
guardianship
or
thought
of
wards
but
instead
a
full
and
honorable
association
as
of
partners
between
ourselves
and
our
neighbors
in
the
interest
of
all
america
north
and
south
our
concern
for
the
independence
and
prosperity
of
the
states
of
central
and
south
america
is
not
altered
we
retain
unabated
the
spirit
that
has
inspired
us
throughout
the
whole
life
of
our
government
and
which
was
so
frankly
put
into
words
by
president
monroe
we
still
mean
always
to
make
a
common
cause
of
national
independence
and
of
political
liberty
in
america
but
that
purpose
is
now
better
understood
so
far
as
it
concerns
ourselves
it
is
known
not
to
be
a
selfish
purpose
it
is
known
to
have
in
it
no
thought
of
taking
advantage
of
any
government
in
this
hemisphere
or
playing
its
political
fortunes
for
our
own
benefit
all
the
governments
of
america
stand
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
upon
a
footing
of
genuine
equality
and
unquestioned
independence
we
have
been
put
to
the
test
in
the
case
of
mexico
and
we
have
stood
the
test
whether
we
have
benefited
mexico
by
the
course
we
have
pursued
remains
to
be
seen
her
fortunes
are
in
her
own
hands
but
we
have
at
least
proved
that
we
will
not
take
advantage
of
her
in
her
distress
and
undertake
to
impose
upon
her
an
order
and
government
of
our
own
choosing
liberty
is
often
a
fierce
and
intractable
thing
to
which
no
bounds
can
be
set
and
to
which
no
bounds
of
a
few
mens
choosing
ought
ever
to
be
set
every
american
who
has
drunk
at
the
true
fountains
of
principle
and
tradition
must
subscribe
without
reservation
to
the
high
doctrine
of
the
virginia
bill
of
rights
which
in
the
great
days
in
which
our
government
was
set
up
was
everywhere
amongst
us
accepted
as
the
creed
of
free
men
that
doctrine
is
that
government
is
or
ought
to
be
instituted
for
the
common
benefit
protection
and
security
of
the
people
nation
or
community
that
of
all
the
various
modes
and
forms
of
government
that
is
the
best
which
is
capable
of
producing
the
greatest
degree
of
happiness
and
safety
and
is
most
effectually
secured
against
the
danger
of
maladministration
and
that
when
any
government
shall
be
found
inadequate
or
contrary
to
these
purposes
a
majority
of
the
community
hath
an
indubitable
inalienable
and
indefeasible
right
to
reform
alter
or
abolish
it
in
such
manner
as
shall
be
judged
most
conducive
to
the
public
weal
we
have
unhesitatingly
applied
that
heroic
principle
to
the
case
of
mexico
and
now
hopefully
await
the
rebirth
of
the
troubled
republic
which
had
so
much
of
which
to
purge
itself
and
so
little
sympathy
from
any
outside
quarter
in
the
radical
but
necessary
process
we
will
aid
and
befriend
mexico
but
we
will
not
coerce
her
and
our
course
with
regard
to
her
ought
to
be
sufficient
proof
to
all
america
that
we
seek
no
political
suzerainty
or
selfish
control
the
moral
is
that
the
states
of
america
are
not
hostile
rivals
but
cooperating
friends
and
that
their
growing
sense
of
community
or
interest
alike
in
matters
political
and
in
matters
economic
is
likely
to
give
them
a
new
significance
as
factors
in
international
affairs
and
in
the
political
history
of
the
world
it
presents
them
as
in
a
very
deep
and
true
sense
a
unit
in
world
affairs
spiritual
partners
standing
together
because
thinking
together
quick
with
common
sympathies
and
common
ideals
separated
they
are
subject
to
all
the
cross
currents
of
the
confused
politics
of
a
world
of
hostile
rivalries
united
in
spirit
and
purpose
they
cannot
be
disappointed
of
their
peaceful
destiny
this
is
panamericanism
it
has
none
of
the
spirit
of
empire
in
it
it
is
the
embodiment
the
effectual
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
law
and
independence
and
liberty
and
mutual
service
a
very
notable
body
of
men
recently
met
in
the
city
of
washington
at
the
invitation
and
as
the
guests
of
this
government
whose
deliberations
are
likely
to
be
looked
back
to
as
marking
a
memorable
turning
point
in
the
history
of
america
they
were
representative
spokesmen
of
the
several
independent
states
of
this
hemisphere
and
were
assembled
to
discuss
the
financial
and
commercial
relations
of
the
republics
of
the
two
continents
which
nature
and
political
fortune
have
so
intimately
linked
together
i
earnestly
recommend
to
your
perusal
the
reports
of
their
proceedings
and
of
the
actions
of
their
committees
you
will
get
from
them
i
think
a
fresh
conception
of
the
ease
and
intelligence
and
advantage
with
which
americans
of
both
continents
may
draw
together
in
practical
cooperation
and
of
what
the
material
foundations
of
this
hopeful
partnership
of
interest
must
consistof
how
we
should
build
them
and
of
how
necessary
it
is
that
we
should
hasten
their
building
there
is
i
venture
to
point
out
an
especial
significance
just
now
attaching
to
this
whole
matter
of
drawing
the
americans
together
in
bonds
of
honorable
partnership
and
mutual
advantage
because
of
the
economic
readjustments
which
the
world
must
inevitably
witness
within
the
next
generation
when
peace
shall
have
at
last
resumed
its
healthful
tasks
in
the
performance
of
these
tasks
i
believe
the
americas
to
be
destined
to
play
their
parts
together
i
am
interested
to
fix
your
attention
on
this
prospect
now
because
unless
you
take
it
within
your
view
and
permit
the
full
significance
of
it
to
command
your
thought
i
cannot
find
the
right
light
in
which
to
set
forth
the
particular
matter
that
lies
at
the
very
font
of
my
whole
thought
as
i
address
you
today
i
mean
national
defense
no
one
who
really
comprehends
the
spirit
of
the
great
people
for
whom
we
are
appointed
to
speak
can
fail
to
perceive
that
their
passion
is
for
peace
their
genius
best
displayed
in
the
practice
of
the
arts
of
peace
great
democracies
are
not
belligerent
they
do
not
seek
or
desire
war
their
thought
is
of
individual
liberty
and
of
the
free
labor
that
supports
life
and
the
uncensored
thought
that
quickens
it
conquest
and
dominion
are
not
in
our
reckoning
or
agreeable
to
our
principles
but
just
because
we
demand
unmolested
development
and
the
undisturbed
government
of
our
own
lives
upon
our
own
principles
of
right
and
liberty
we
resent
from
whatever
quarter
it
may
come
the
aggression
we
ourselves
will
not
practice
we
insist
upon
security
in
prosecuting
our
selfchosen
lines
of
national
development
we
do
more
than
that
we
demand
it
also
for
others
we
do
not
confine
our
enthusiasm
for
individual
liberty
and
free
national
development
to
the
incidents
and
movements
of
affairs
which
affect
only
ourselves
we
feel
it
wherever
there
is
a
people
that
tries
to
walk
in
these
difficult
paths
of
independence
and
right
from
the
first
we
have
made
common
cause
with
all
partisans
of
liberty
on
this
side
the
sea
and
have
deemed
it
as
important
that
our
neighbors
should
be
free
from
all
outside
domination
as
that
we
ourselves
should
be
we
have
set
america
aside
as
a
whole
for
the
uses
of
independent
nations
and
political
freemen
out
of
such
thoughts
grow
all
our
policies
we
regard
war
merely
as
a
means
of
asserting
the
rights
of
a
people
against
aggression
and
we
are
as
fiercely
jealous
of
coercive
or
dictatorial
power
within
our
own
nation
as
of
aggression
from
without
we
will
not
maintain
a
standing
army
except
for
uses
which
are
as
necessary
in
times
of
peace
as
in
times
of
war
and
we
s
hall
always
see
to
it
that
our
military
peace
establishment
is
no
larger
than
is
actually
and
continuously
needed
for
the
uses
of
days
in
which
no
enemies
move
against
us
but
we
do
believe
in
a
body
of
free
citizens
ready
and
sufficient
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
of
the
governments
which
they
have
set
up
to
serve
them
in
our
constitutions
themselves
we
have
commanded
that
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
and
our
confidence
has
been
that
our
safety
in
times
of
danger
would
lie
in
the
rising
of
the
nation
to
take
care
of
itself
as
the
farmers
rose
at
lexington
but
war
has
never
been
a
mere
matter
of
men
and
guns
it
is
a
thing
of
disciplined
might
if
our
citizens
are
ever
to
fight
effectively
upon
a
sudden
summons
they
must
know
how
modern
fighting
is
done
and
what
to
do
when
the
summons
comes
to
render
themselves
immediately
available
and
immediately
effective
and
the
government
must
be
their
servant
in
this
matter
must
supply
them
with
the
training
they
need
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
of
it
the
military
arm
of
their
government
which
they
will
not
allow
to
direct
them
they
may
properly
use
to
serve
them
and
make
their
independence
secureand
not
their
own
independence
merely
but
the
rights
also
of
those
with
whom
they
have
made
common
cause
should
they
also
be
put
in
jeopardy
they
must
be
fitted
to
play
the
great
role
in
the
world
and
particularly
in
this
hemisphere
for
which
they
are
qualified
by
principle
and
by
chastened
ambition
to
play
it
is
with
these
ideals
in
mind
that
the
plans
of
the
department
of
war
for
more
adequate
national
defense
were
conceived
which
will
be
laid
before
you
and
which
i
urge
you
to
sanction
and
put
into
effect
as
soon
as
they
can
be
properly
scrutinized
and
discussed
they
seem
to
me
the
essential
first
steps
and
they
seem
to
me
for
the
present
sufficient
they
contemplate
an
increase
of
the
standing
force
of
the
regular
army
from
its
present
strength
of
five
thousand
and
twentythree
officers
and
one
hundred
and
two
thousand
nine
hundred
and
eightyfive
enlisted
men
of
all
services
to
a
strength
of
seven
thousand
one
hundred
and
thirtysix
officers
and
one
hundred
and
thirtyfour
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seven
enlisted
men
or
all
told
all
services
rank
and
file
by
the
addition
of
fiftytwo
companies
of
coast
artillery
fifteen
companies
of
engineers
ten
regiments
of
infantry
four
regiments
of
field
artillery
and
four
aero
squadrons
besides
seven
hundred
and
fifty
officers
required
for
a
great
variety
of
extra
service
especially
the
all
important
duty
of
training
the
citizen
force
of
which
i
shall
presently
speak
seven
hundred
and
ninetytwo
noncommissioned
officers
for
service
in
drill
recruiting
and
the
like
and
the
necessary
quota
of
enlisted
men
for
the
quartermaster
corps
the
hospital
corps
the
ordnance
department
and
other
similar
auxiliary
services
these
are
the
additions
necessary
to
render
the
army
adequate
for
its
present
duties
duties
which
it
has
to
perform
not
only
upon
our
own
continental
coasts
and
borders
and
at
our
interior
army
posts
but
also
in
the
philippines
in
the
hawaiian
islands
at
the
isthmus
and
in
porto
rico
by
way
of
making
the
country
ready
to
assert
some
part
of
its
real
power
promptly
and
upon
a
larger
scale
should
occasion
arise
the
plan
also
contemplates
supplementing
the
army
by
a
force
of
four
hundred
thousand
disciplined
citizens
raised
in
increments
of
one
hundred
and
thirtythree
thousand
a
year
throughout
a
period
of
three
years
this
it
is
proposed
to
do
by
a
process
of
enlistment
under
which
the
serviceable
men
of
the
country
would
be
asked
to
bind
themselves
to
serve
with
the
colors
for
purposes
of
training
for
short
periods
throughout
three
years
and
to
come
to
the
colors
at
call
at
any
time
throughout
an
additional
furlough
period
of
three
years
this
force
of
four
hundred
thousand
men
would
be
provided
with
personal
accoutrements
as
fast
as
enlisted
and
their
equipment
for
the
field
made
ready
to
be
supplied
at
any
time
they
would
be
assembled
for
training
at
stated
intervals
at
convenient
places
in
association
with
suitable
units
of
the
regular
army
their
period
of
annual
training
would
not
necessarily
exceed
two
months
in
the
year
it
would
depend
upon
the
patriotic
feeling
of
the
younger
men
of
the
country
whether
they
responded
to
such
a
call
to
service
or
not
it
would
depend
upon
the
patriotic
spirit
of
the
employers
of
the
country
whether
they
made
it
possible
for
the
younger
men
in
their
employ
to
respond
under
favorable
conditions
or
not
i
for
one
do
not
doubt
the
patriotic
devotion
either
of
our
young
men
or
of
those
who
give
them
employmentthose
for
whose
benefit
and
protection
they
would
in
fact
enlist
i
would
look
forward
to
the
success
of
such
an
experiment
with
entire
confidence
at
least
so
much
by
way
of
preparation
for
defense
seems
to
me
to
be
absolutely
imperative
now
we
cannot
do
less
the
programme
which
will
be
laid
before
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
is
similarly
conceived
it
involves
only
a
shortening
of
the
time
within
which
plans
long
matured
shall
be
carried
out
but
it
does
make
definite
and
explicit
a
programme
which
has
heretofore
been
only
implicit
held
in
the
minds
of
the
committees
on
naval
affairs
and
disclosed
in
the
debates
of
the
two
houses
but
nowhere
formulated
or
formally
adopted
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
it
will
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
country
for
the
congress
to
adopt
a
comprehensive
plan
for
putting
the
navy
upon
a
final
footing
of
strength
and
efficiency
and
to
press
that
plan
to
completion
within
the
next
five
years
we
have
always
looked
to
the
navy
of
the
country
as
our
first
and
chief
line
of
defense
we
have
always
seen
it
to
be
our
manifest
course
of
prudence
to
be
strong
on
the
seas
year
by
year
we
have
been
creating
a
navy
which
now
ranks
very
high
indeed
among
the
navies
of
the
maritime
nations
we
should
now
definitely
determine
how
we
shall
complete
what
we
have
begun
and
how
soon
the
programme
to
be
laid
before
you
contemplates
the
construction
within
five
years
of
ten
battleships
six
battle
cruisers
ten
scout
cruisers
fifty
destroyers
fifteen
fleet
submarines
eightyfive
coast
submarines
four
gunboats
one
hospital
ship
two
ammunition
ships
two
fuel
oil
ships
and
one
repair
ship
it
is
proposed
that
of
this
number
we
shall
the
first
year
provide
for
the
construction
of
two
battleships
two
battle
cruisers
three
scout
cruisers
fifteen
destroyers
five
fleet
submarines
twentyfive
coast
submarines
two
gunboats
and
one
hospital
ship
the
second
year
two
battleships
one
scout
cruiser
ten
destroyers
four
fleet
submarines
fifteen
coast
submarines
one
gunboat
and
one
fuel
oil
ship
the
third
year
two
battleships
one
battle
cruiser
two
scout
cruisers
five
destroyers
two
fleet
sub
marines
and
fifteen
coast
submarines
the
fourth
year
two
battleships
two
battle
cruisers
two
scout
cruisers
ten
destroyers
two
fleet
submarines
fifteen
coast
submarines
one
ammunition
ship
and
one
fuel
oil
ship
and
the
fifth
year
two
battleships
one
battle
cruiser
two
scout
cruisers
ten
destroyers
two
fleet
submarines
fifteen
coast
submarines
one
gunboat
one
ammunition
ship
and
one
repair
ship
the
secretary
of
the
navy
is
asking
also
for
the
immediate
addition
to
the
personnel
of
the
navy
of
seven
thousand
five
hundred
sailors
twentyfive
hundred
apprentice
seamen
and
fifteen
hundred
marines
this
increase
would
be
sufficient
to
care
for
the
ships
which
are
to
be
completed
within
the
fiscal
year
and
also
for
the
number
of
men
which
must
be
put
in
training
to
man
the
ships
which
will
be
completed
early
in
it
is
also
necessary
that
the
number
of
midshipmen
at
the
naval
academy
at
annapolis
should
be
increased
by
at
least
three
hundred
in
order
that
the
force
of
officers
should
be
more
rapidly
added
to
and
authority
is
asked
to
appoint
for
engineering
duties
only
approved
graduates
of
engineering
colleges
and
for
service
in
the
aviation
corps
a
certain
number
of
men
taken
from
civil
life
if
this
full
programme
should
be
carried
out
we
should
have
built
or
building
in
according
to
the
estimates
of
survival
and
standards
of
classification
followed
by
the
general
board
of
the
department
an
effective
navy
consisting
of
twentyseven
battleships
of
the
first
line
six
battle
cruisers
twentyfive
battleships
of
the
second
line
ten
armored
cruisers
thirteen
scout
cruisers
five
first
class
cruisers
three
second
class
cruisers
ten
third
class
cruisers
one
hundred
and
eight
destroyers
eighteen
fleet
submarines
one
hundred
and
fiftyseven
coast
submarines
six
monitors
twenty
gunboats
four
supply
ships
fifteen
fuel
ships
four
transports
three
tenders
to
torpedo
vessels
eight
vessels
of
special
types
and
two
ammunition
ships
this
would
be
a
navy
fitted
to
our
needs
and
worthy
of
our
traditions
but
armies
and
instruments
of
war
are
only
part
of
what
has
to
be
considered
if
we
are
to
provide
for
the
supreme
matter
of
national
selfsufficiency
and
security
in
all
its
aspects
there
are
other
great
matters
which
will
be
thrust
upon
our
attention
whether
we
will
or
not
there
is
for
example
a
very
pressing
question
of
trade
and
shipping
involved
in
this
great
problem
of
national
adequacy
it
is
necessary
for
many
weighty
reasons
of
national
efficiency
and
development
that
we
should
have
a
great
merchant
marine
the
great
merchant
fleet
we
once
used
to
make
us
rich
that
great
body
of
sturdy
sailors
who
used
to
carry
our
flag
into
every
sea
and
who
were
the
pride
and
often
the
bulwark
of
the
nation
we
have
almost
driven
out
of
existence
by
inexcusable
neglect
and
indifference
and
by
a
hopelessly
blind
and
provincial
policy
of
socalled
economic
protection
it
is
high
time
we
repaired
our
mistake
and
resumed
our
commercial
independence
on
the
seas
for
it
is
a
question
of
independence
if
other
nations
go
to
war
or
seek
to
hamper
each
others
commerce
our
merchants
it
seems
are
at
their
mercy
to
do
with
as
they
please
we
must
use
their
ships
and
use
them
as
they
determine
we
have
not
ships
enough
of
our
own
we
cannot
hand
le
our
own
commerce
on
the
seas
our
independence
is
provincial
and
is
only
on
land
and
within
our
own
borders
we
are
not
likely
to
be
permitted
to
use
even
the
ships
of
other
nations
in
rivalry
of
their
own
trade
and
are
without
means
to
extend
our
commerce
even
where
the
doors
are
wide
open
and
our
goods
desired
such
a
situation
is
not
to
be
endured
it
is
of
capital
importance
not
only
that
the
united
states
should
be
its
own
carrier
on
the
seas
and
enjoy
the
economic
independence
which
only
an
adequate
merchant
marine
would
give
it
but
also
that
the
american
hemisphere
as
a
whole
should
enjoy
a
like
independence
and
selfsufficiency
if
it
is
not
to
be
drawn
into
the
tangle
of
european
affairs
without
such
independence
the
whole
question
of
our
political
unity
and
selfdetermination
is
very
seriously
clouded
and
complicated
indeed
moreover
we
can
develop
no
true
or
effective
american
policy
without
ships
of
our
ownnot
ships
of
war
but
ships
of
peace
carrying
goods
and
carrying
much
more
creating
friendships
and
rendering
indispensable
services
to
all
interests
on
this
side
the
water
they
must
move
constantly
back
and
forth
between
the
americas
they
are
the
only
shuttles
that
can
weave
the
delicate
fabric
of
sympathy
comprehension
confidence
and
mutual
dependence
in
which
we
wish
to
clothe
our
policy
of
america
for
americans
the
task
of
building
up
an
adequate
merchant
marine
for
america
private
capital
must
ultimately
undertake
and
achieve
as
it
has
undertaken
and
achieved
every
other
like
task
amongst
us
in
the
past
with
admirable
enterprise
intelligence
and
vigor
and
it
seems
to
me
a
manifest
dictate
of
wisdom
that
we
should
promptly
remove
every
legal
obstacle
that
may
stand
in
the
way
of
this
much
to
be
desired
revival
of
our
old
independence
and
should
facilitate
in
every
possible
way
the
building
purchase
and
american
registration
of
ships
but
capital
cannot
accomplish
this
great
task
of
a
sudden
it
must
embark
upon
it
by
degrees
as
the
opportunities
of
trade
develop
something
must
be
done
at
once
done
to
open
routes
and
develop
opportunities
where
they
are
as
yet
undeveloped
done
to
open
the
arteries
of
trade
where
the
currents
have
not
yet
learned
to
runespecially
between
the
two
american
continents
where
they
are
singularly
enough
yet
to
be
created
and
quickened
and
it
is
evident
that
only
the
government
can
undertake
such
beginnings
and
assume
the
initial
financial
risks
when
the
risk
has
passed
and
private
capital
begins
to
find
its
way
in
sufficient
abundance
into
these
new
channels
the
government
may
withdraw
but
it
cannot
omit
to
begin
it
should
take
the
first
steps
and
should
take
them
at
once
our
goods
must
not
lie
piled
up
at
our
ports
and
stored
upon
side
tracks
in
freight
cars
which
are
daily
needed
on
the
roads
must
not
be
left
without
means
of
transport
to
any
foreign
quarter
we
must
not
await
the
permission
of
foreign
shipowners
and
foreign
governments
to
send
them
where
we
will
with
a
view
to
meeting
these
pressing
necessities
of
our
commerce
and
availing
ourselves
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
of
the
present
unparalleled
opportunity
of
linking
the
two
americas
together
in
bonds
of
mutual
interest
and
service
an
opportunity
which
may
never
return
again
if
we
miss
it
now
proposals
will
be
made
to
the
present
congress
for
the
purchase
or
construction
of
ships
to
be
owned
and
directed
by
the
government
similar
to
those
made
to
the
last
congress
but
modified
in
some
essential
particulars
i
recommend
these
proposals
to
you
for
your
prompt
acceptance
with
the
more
confidence
because
every
month
that
has
elapsed
since
the
former
proposals
were
made
has
made
the
necessity
for
such
action
more
and
more
manifestly
imperative
that
need
was
then
foreseen
it
is
now
acutely
felt
and
everywhere
realized
by
those
for
whom
trade
is
waiting
but
who
can
find
no
conveyance
for
their
goods
i
am
not
so
much
interested
in
the
particulars
of
the
programme
as
i
am
in
taking
immediate
advantage
of
the
great
opportunity
which
awaits
us
if
we
will
but
act
in
this
emergency
in
this
matter
as
in
all
others
a
spirit
of
common
counsel
should
prevail
and
out
of
it
should
come
an
early
solution
of
this
pressing
problem
there
is
another
matter
which
seems
to
me
to
be
very
intimately
associated
with
the
question
of
national
safety
and
preparation
for
defense
that
is
our
policy
towards
the
philippines
and
the
people
of
porto
rico
our
treatment
of
them
and
their
attitude
towards
us
are
manifestly
of
the
first
consequence
in
the
development
of
our
duties
in
the
world
and
in
getting
a
free
hand
to
perform
those
duties
we
must
be
free
from
every
unnecessary
burden
or
embarrassment
and
there
is
no
better
way
to
be
clear
of
embarrassment
than
to
fulfil
our
promises
and
promote
the
interests
of
those
dependent
on
us
to
the
utmost
bills
for
the
alteration
and
reform
of
the
government
of
the
philippines
and
for
rendering
fuller
political
justice
to
the
people
of
porto
rico
were
submitted
to
the
sixtythird
congress
they
will
be
submitted
also
to
you
i
need
not
particularize
their
details
you
are
most
of
you
already
familiar
with
them
but
i
do
recommend
them
to
your
early
adoption
with
the
sincere
conviction
that
there
are
few
measures
you
could
adopt
which
would
more
serviceably
clear
the
way
for
the
great
policies
by
which
we
wish
to
make
good
now
and
always
our
right
to
lead
in
enterprises
of
peace
and
good
will
and
economic
and
political
freedom
the
plans
for
the
armed
forces
of
the
nation
which
i
have
outlined
and
for
the
general
policy
of
adequate
preparation
for
mobilization
and
defense
involve
of
course
very
large
additional
expenditures
of
moneyexpenditures
which
will
considerably
exceed
the
estimated
revenues
of
the
government
it
is
made
my
duty
by
law
whenever
the
estimates
of
expenditure
exceed
the
estimates
of
revenue
to
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
fact
and
suggest
any
means
of
meeting
the
deficiency
that
it
may
be
wise
or
possible
for
me
to
suggest
i
am
ready
to
believe
that
it
would
be
my
duty
to
do
so
in
any
case
and
i
feel
particularly
bound
to
speak
of
the
matter
when
it
appears
that
the
deficiency
will
arise
directly
out
of
the
adoption
by
the
congress
of
measures
which
i
myself
urge
it
to
adopt
allow
me
therefore
to
speak
briefly
of
the
present
state
of
the
treasury
and
of
the
fiscal
problems
which
the
next
year
will
probably
disclose
on
the
thirtieth
of
june
last
there
was
an
available
balance
in
the
general
fund
of
the
treasury
of
the
total
estimated
receipts
for
the
year
on
the
assumption
that
the
emergency
revenue
measure
passed
by
the
last
congress
will
not
be
extended
beyond
its
present
limit
the
thirtyfirst
of
december
and
that
the
present
duty
of
one
cent
per
pound
on
sugar
will
be
discontinued
after
the
first
of
may
will
be
the
balance
of
june
last
and
these
estimated
revenues
come
therefore
to
a
grand
total
of
the
total
estimated
disbursements
for
the
present
fiscal
year
including
twentyfive
millions
for
the
panama
canal
twelve
millions
for
probable
deficiency
appropriations
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
miscellaneous
debt
redemptions
will
be
and
the
balance
in
the
general
fund
of
the
treasury
will
be
reduced
to
the
emergency
revenue
act
if
continued
beyond
its
present
time
limitation
would
produce
during
the
half
year
then
remaining
about
fortyone
millions
the
duty
of
one
cent
per
pound
on
sugar
if
continued
would
produce
during
the
two
months
of
the
fiscal
year
remaining
after
the
first
of
may
about
fifteen
millions
these
two
sums
amounting
together
to
fiftysix
millions
if
added
to
the
revenues
of
the
second
half
of
the
fiscal
year
would
yield
the
treasury
at
the
end
of
the
year
an
available
balance
of
the
additional
revenues
required
to
carry
out
the
programme
of
military
and
naval
preparation
of
which
i
have
spoken
would
as
at
present
estimated
be
for
the
fiscal
year
those
figures
taken
with
the
figures
for
the
present
fiscal
year
which
i
have
already
given
disclose
our
financial
problem
for
the
year
assuming
that
the
taxes
imposed
by
the
emergency
revenue
act
and
the
present
duty
on
sugar
are
to
be
discontinued
and
that
the
balance
at
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
will
be
only
that
the
disbursements
for
the
panama
canal
will
again
be
about
twentyfive
millions
and
that
the
additional
expenditures
for
the
army
and
navy
are
authorized
by
the
congress
the
deficit
in
the
general
fund
of
the
treasury
on
the
thirtieth
of
june
will
be
nearly
two
hundred
and
thirtyfive
millions
to
this
sum
at
least
fifty
millions
should
be
added
to
represent
a
safe
working
balance
for
the
treasury
and
twelve
millions
to
include
the
usual
deficiency
estimates
in
and
these
additions
would
make
a
total
deficit
of
some
two
hundred
and
ninetyseven
millions
if
the
present
taxes
should
be
continued
throughout
this
year
and
the
next
however
there
would
be
a
balance
in
the
treasury
of
some
seventysix
and
a
half
millions
at
the
end
of
the
present
fiscal
year
and
a
deficit
at
the
end
of
the
next
year
of
only
some
fifty
millions
or
reckoning
in
sixtytwo
millions
for
deficiency
appropriations
and
a
safe
treasury
balance
at
the
end
of
the
year
a
total
deficit
of
some
one
hundred
and
twelve
millions
the
obvious
moral
of
the
figures
is
that
it
is
a
plain
counsel
of
prudence
to
continue
all
of
the
present
taxes
or
their
equivalents
and
confine
ourselves
to
the
problem
of
providing
one
hundred
and
twelve
millions
of
new
revenue
rather
than
two
hundred
and
ninetyseven
millions
how
shall
we
obtain
the
new
revenue
we
are
frequently
reminded
that
there
are
many
millions
of
bonds
which
the
treasury
is
authorized
under
existing
law
to
sell
to
reimburse
the
sums
paid
out
of
current
revenues
for
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
and
it
is
true
that
bonds
to
the
amount
of
approximately
are
now
available
for
that
purpose
prior
to
of
these
bonds
had
actually
been
sold
to
recoup
the
expenditures
at
the
isthmus
and
now
constitute
a
considerable
item
of
the
public
debt
but
i
for
one
do
not
believe
that
the
people
of
this
country

approve
of
postponing
the
payment
of
their
bills
borrowing
money
is
shortsighted
finance
it
can
be
justified
only
when
permanent
things
are
to
be
accomplished
which
many
generations
will
certainly
benefit
by
and
which
it
seems
hardly
fair
that
a
single
generation
should
pay
for
the
objects
we
are
now
proposing
to
spend
money
for
cannot
be
so
classified
except
in
the
sense
that
everything
wisely
done
may
be
said
to
be
done
in
the
interest
of
posterity
as
well
as
in
our
own
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
dictate
of
prudent
statesmanship
and
frank
finance
that
in
what
we
are
now
i
hope
about
to
undertake
we
should
pay
as
we
go
the
people
of
the
country
are
entitled
to
know
just
what
burdens
of
taxation
they
are
to
carry
and
to
know
from
the
outset
now
the
new
bills
should
be
paid
by
internal
taxation
to
what
sources
then
shall
we
turn
this
is
so
peculiarly
a
question
which
the
gentlemen
of
the
house
of
representatives
are
expected
under
the
constitution
to
propose
an
answer
to
that
you
will
hardly
expect
me
to
do
more
than
discuss
it
in
very
general
terms
we
should
be
following
an
almost
universal
example
of
modern
governments
if
we
were
to
draw
the
greater
part
or
even
the
whole
of
the
revenues
we
need
from
the
income
taxes
by
somewhat
lowering
the
present
limits
of
exemption
and
the
figure
at
which
the
surtax
shall
begin
to
be
imposed
and
by
increasing
step
by
step
throughout
the
present
graduation
the
surtax
itself
the
income
taxes
as
at
present
apportioned
would
yield
sums
sufficient
to
balance
the
books
of
the
treasury
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
without
anywhere
making
the
burden
unreasonably
or
oppressively
heavy
the
precise
reckonings
are
fully
and
accurately
set
out
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
will
be
immediately
laid
before
you
and
there
are
many
additional
sources
of
revenue
which
can
justly
be
resorted
to
without
hampering
the
industries
of
the
country
or
putting
any
too
great
charge
upon
individual
expenditure
a
tax
of
one
cent
per
gallon
on
gasoline
and
naphtha
would
yield
at
the
present
estimated
production
a
tax
of
fifty
cents
per
horse
power
on
automobiles
and
internal
explosion
engines
a
stamp
tax
on
bank
cheques
probably
a
tax
of
twentyfive
cents
per
ton
on
pig
iron
a
tax
of
twentyfive
cents
per
ton
on
fabricated
iron
and
steel
probably
in
a
country
of
great
industries
like
this
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
distribute
the
burdens
of
taxation
without
making
them
anywhere
bear
too
heavily
or
too
exclusively
upon
any
one
set
of
persons
or
undertakings
what
is
clear
is
that
the
industry
of
this
generation
should
pay
the
bills
of
this
generation
i
have
spoken
to
you
today
gentlemen
upon
a
single
theme
the
thorough
preparation
of
the
nation
to
care
for
its
own
security
and
to
make
sure
of
entire
freedom
to
play
the
impartial
role
in
this
hemisphere
and
in
the
world
which
we
all
believe
to
have
been
providentially
assigned
to
it
i
have
had
in
my
mind
no
thought
of
any
immediate
or
particular
danger
arising
out
of
our
relations
with
other
nations
we
are
at
peace
with
all
the
nations
of
the
world
and
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
no
question
in
controversy
between
this
and
other
governments
will
lead
to
any
serious
breach
of
amicable
relations
grave
as
some
differences
of
attitude
and
policy
have
been
land
may
yet
turn
out
to
be
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
gravest
threats
against
our
national
peace
and
safety
have
been
uttered
within
our
own
borders
there
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
i
blush
to
admit
born
under
other
flags
but
welcomed
under
our
generous
naturalization
laws
to
the
full
freedom
and
opportunity
of
america
who
have
poured
the
poison
of
disloyalty
into
the
very
arteries
of
our
national
life
who
have
sought
to
bring
the
authority
and
good
name
of
our
government
into
contempt
to
destroy
our
industries
wherever
they
thought
it
effective
for
their
vindictive
purposes
to
strike
at
them
and
to
debase
our
politics
to
the
uses
of
foreign
intrigue
their
number
is
not
great
as
compared
with
the
whole
number
of
those
sturdy
hosts
by
which
our
nation
has
been
enriched
in
recent
generations
out
of
virile
foreign
stock
but
it
is
great
enough
to
have
brought
deep
disgrace
upon
us
and
to
have
made
it
necessary
that
we
should
promptly
make
use
of
processes
of
law
by
which
we
may
be
purged
of
their
corrupt
distempers
america
never
witnessed
anything
like
this
before
it
never
dreamed
it
possible
that
men
sworn
into
its
own
citizenship
men
drawn
out
of
great
free
stocks
such
as
supplied
some
of
the
best
and
strongest
elements
of
that
little
but
how
heroic
nation
that
in
a
high
day
of
old
staked
its
very
life
to
free
itself
from
every
entanglement
that
had
darkened
the
fortunes
of
the
older
nations
and
set
up
a
new
standard
here
that
men
of
such
origins
and
such
free
choices
of
allegiance
would
ever
turn
in
malign
reaction
against
the
government
and
people
who
had
welcomed
and
nurtured
them
and
seek
to
make
this
proud
country
once
more
a
hotbed
of
european
passion
a
little
while
ago
such
a
thing
would
have
seemed
incredible
because
it
was
incredible
we
made
no
preparation
for
it
we
would
have
been
almost
ashamed
to
prepare
for
it
as
if
we
were
suspicious
of
ourselves
our
own
comrades
and
neighbors
but
the
ugly
and
incredible
thing
has
actually
come
about
and
we
are
without
adequate
federal
laws
to
deal
with
it
i
urge
you
to
enact
such
laws
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
feel
that
in
doing
so
i
am
urging
you
to
do
nothing
less
than
save
the
honor
and
selfrespect
of
the
nation
such
creatures
of
passion
disloyalty
and
anarchy
must
be
crushed
out
they
are
not
many
but
they
are
infinitely
malignant
and
the
hand
of
our
power
should
close
over
them
at
once
they
have
formed
plots
to
destroy
property
they
have
entered
into
conspiracies
against
the
neutrality
of
the
government
they
have
sought
to
pry
into
every
confidential
transaction
of
the
government
in
order
to
serve
interests
alien
to
our
own
it
is
possible
to
deal
with
these
things
very
effectually
i
need
not
suggest
the
terms
in
which
they
may
be
dealt
with
i
wish
that
it
could
be
said
that
only
a
few
men
misled
by
mistaken
sentiments
of
allegiance
to
the
governments
under
which
they
were
born
had
been
guilty
of
disturbing
the
selfpossession
and
misrepresenting
the
temper
and
principles
of
the
country
during
these
days
of
terrible
war
when
it
would
seem
that
every
man
who
was
truly
an
american
would
instinctively
make
it
his
duty
and
his
pride
to
keep
the
scales
of
judgment
even
and
prove
himself
a
partisan
of
no
nation
but
his
own
but
it
cannot
there
are
some
men
among
us
and
many
resident
abroad
who
though
born
and
bred
in
the
united
states
and
calling
themselves
americans
have
so
forgotten
themselves
and
their
honor
as
citizens
as
to
put
their
passionate
sympathy
with
one
or
the
other
side
in
the
great
european
conflict
above
their
regard
for
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
united
states
they
also
preach
and
practice
disloyalty
no
laws
i
suppose
can
reach
corruptions
of
the
mind
and
heart
but
i
should
not
speak
of
others
without
also
speaking
of
these
and
expressing
the
even
deeper
humiliation
and
scorn
which
every
selfpossessed
and
thoughtfully
patriotic
american
must
feel
when
he
thinks
of
them
and
of
the
discredit
they
are
daily
bringing
upon
us
while
we
speak
of
the
preparation
of
the
nation
to
make
sure
of
her
security
and
her
effective
power
we
must
not
fall
into
the
patent
error
of
supposing
that
her
real
strength
comes
from
armaments
and
mere
safeguards
of
written
law
it
comes
of
course
from
her
people
their
energy
their
success
in
their
undertakings
their
free
opportunity
to
use
the
natural
resources
of
our
great
home
land
and
of
the
lands
outside
our
continental
borders
which
look
to
us
for
protection
for
encouragement
and
for
assistance
in
their
development
from
the
organization
and
freedom
and
vitality
of
our
economic
life
the
domestic
questions
which
engaged
the
attention
of
the
last
congress
are
more
vital
to
the
nation
in
this
its
time
of
test
than
at
any
other
time
we
cannot
adequately
make
ready
for
any
trial
of
our
strength
unless
we
wisely
and
promptly
direct
the
force
of
our
laws
into
these
allimportant
fields
of
domestic
action
a
matter
which
it
seems
to
me
we
should
have
very
much
at
heart
is
the
creation
of
the
right
instrumentalities
by
which
to
mobilize
our
economic
resources
in
any
time
of
national
necessity
i
take
it
for
granted
that
i
do
not
need
your
authority
to
call
into
systematic
consultation
with
the
directing
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
men
of
recognized
leadership
and
ability
from
among
our
citizens
who
are
thoroughly
familiar
for
example
with
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
country
and
therefore
competent
to
advise
how
they
may
be
coordinated
when
the
need
arises
those
who
can
suggest
the
best
way
in
which
to
bring
about
prompt
cooperation
among
the
manufacturers
of
the
country
should
it
be
necessary
and
those
who
could
assist
to
bring
the
technical
skill
of
the
country
to
the
aid
of
the
government
in
the
solution
of
particular
problems
of
defense
i
only
hope
that
if
i
should
find
it
feasible
to
constitute
such
an
advisory
body
the
congress
would
be
willing
to
vote
the
small
sum
of
money
that
would
be
needed
to
defray
the
expenses
that
would
probably
be
necessary
to
give
it
the
clerical
and
administrative
machinery
with
which
to
do
serviceable
work
what
is
more
important
is
that
the
industries
and
resources
of
the
country
should
be
available
and
ready
for
mobilization
it
is
the
more
imperatively
necessary
therefore
that
we
should
promptly
devise
means
for
doing
what
we
have
not
yet
done
that
we
should
give
intelligent
federal
aid
and
stimulation
to
industrial
and
vocational
education
as
we
have
long
done
in
the
large
field
of
our
agricultural
industry
that
at
the
same
time
that
we
safeguard
and
conserve
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
we
should
put
them
at
the
disposal
of
those
who
will
use
them
promptly
and
intelligently
as
was
sought
to
be
done
in
the
admirable
bills
submitted
to
the
last
co
ngress
from
its
committees
on
the
public
lands
bills
which
i
earnestly
recommend
in
principle
to
your
consideration
that
we
should
put
into
early
operation
some
provision
for
rural
credits
which
will
add
to
the
extensive
borrowing
facilities
already
afforded
the
farmer
by
the
reserve
bank
act
adequate
instrumentalities
by
which
long
credits
may
be
obtained
on
land
mortgages
and
that
we
should
study
more
carefully
than
they
have
hitherto
been
studied
the
right
adaptation
of
our
economic
arrangements
to
changing
conditions
many
conditions
about
which
we
ilave
repeatedly
legislated
are
being
altered
from
decade
to
decade
it
is
evident
under
our
very
eyes
and
are
likely
to
change
even
more
rapidly
and
more
radically
in
the
days
immediately
ahead
of
us
when
peace
has
returned
to
the
world
and
the
nations
of
europe
once
more
take
up
their
tasks
of
commerce
and
industry
with
the
energy
of
those
who
must
bestir
themselves
to
build
anew
just
what
these
changes
will
be
no
one
can
certainly
foresee
or
confidently
predict
there
are
no
calculable
because
no
stable
elements
in
the
problem
the
most
we
can
do
is
to
make
certain
that
we
have
the
necessary
instrumentalities
of
information
constantly
at
our
service
so
that
we
may
be
sure
that
we
know
exactly
what
we
are
dealing
with
when
we
come
to
act
if
it
should
be
necessary
to
act
at
all
we
must
first
certainly
know
what
it
is
that
we
are
seeking
to
adapt
ourselves
to
i
may
ask
the
privilege
of
addressing
you
more
at
length
on
this
important
matter
a
little
later
in
your
session
in
the
meantime
may
i
make
this
suggestion
the
transportation
problem
is
an
exceedingly
serious
and
pressing
one
in
this
country
there
has
from
time
to
time
of
late
been
reason
to
fear
that
our
railroads
would
not
much
longer
be
able
to
cope
with
it
successfully
as
at
present
equipped
and
coordinated
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
wise
to
provide
for
a
commission
of
inquiry
to
ascertain
by
a
thorough
canvass
of
the
whole
question
whether
our
laws
as
at
present
framed
and
administered
are
as
serviceable
as
they
might
be
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
it
is
obviously
a
problem
that
lies
at
the
very
foundation
of
our
efficiency
as
a
people
such
an
inquiry
ought
to
draw
out
every
circumstance
and
opinion
worth
considering
and
we
need
to
know
all
sides
of
the
matter
if
we
mean
to
do
anything
in
the
field
of
federal
legislation
no
one
i
am
sure
would
wish
to
take
any
backward
step
the
regulation
of
the
railways
of
the
country
by
federal
commission
has
had
admirable
results
and
has
fully
justified
the
hopes
and
expectations
of
those
by
whom
the
policy
of
regulation
was
originally
proposed
the
question
is
not
what
should
we
undo
it
is
whether
there
is
anything
else
we
can
do
that
would
supply
us
with
effective
means
in
the
very
process
of
regulation
for
bettering
the
conditions
under
which
the
railroads
are
operated
and
for
making
them
more
useful
servants
of
the
country
as
a
whole
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
the
part
of
wisdom
therefore
before
further
legislation
in
this
field
is
attempted
to
look
at
the
whole
problem
of
coordination
and
efficiency
in
the
full
light
of
a
fresh
assessment
of
circumstance
and
opinion
as
a
guide
to
dealing
with
the
several
parts
of
it
for
what
we
are
seeking
now
what
in
my
mind
is
the
single
thought
of
this
message
is
national
efficiency
and
security
we
serve
a
great
nation
we
should
serve
it
in
the
spirit
of
its
peculiar
genius
it
is
the
genius
of
common
men
for
selfgovernment
industry
justice
liberty
and
peace
we
should
see
to
it
that
it
lacks
no
instrument
no
facility
or
vigor
of
law
to
make
it
sufficient
to
play
its
part
with
energy
safety
and
assured
success
in
this
we
are
no
partisans
but
heralds
and
prophets
of
a
new
age

gentlemen
of
the
congress
the
session
upon
which
you
are
now
entering
will
be
the
closing
session
of
the
sixtythird
congress
a
congress
i
venture
to
say
which
will
long
be
remembered
for
the
great
body
of
thoughtful
and
constructive
work
which
it
has
done
in
loyal
response
to
the
thought
and
needs
of
the
country
i
should
like
in
this
address
to
review
the
notable
record
and
try
to
make
adequate
assessment
of
it
but
no
doubt
we
stand
too
near
the
work
that
has
been
done
and
are
ourselves
too
much
part
of
it
to
play
the
part
of
historians
toward
it
our
program
of
legislation
with
regard
to
the
regulation
of
business
is
now
virtually
complete
it
has
been
put
forth
as
we
intended
as
a
whole
and
leaves
no
conjecture
as
to
what
is
to
follow
the
road
at
last
lies
clear
and
firm
before
business
it
is
a
road
which
it
can
travel
without
fear
or
embarrassment
it
is
the
road
to
ungrudged
unclouded
success
in
it
every
honest
man
every
man
who
believes
that
the
public
interest
is
part
of
his
own
interest
may
walk
with
perfect
confidence
moreover
our
thoughts
are
now
more
of
the
future
than
of
the
past
while
we
have
worked
at
our
tasks
of
peace
the
circumstances
of
the
whole
age
have
been
altered
by
war
what
we
have
done
for
our
own
land
and
our
own
people
we
did
with
the
best
that
was
in
us
whether
of
character
or
of
intelligence
with
sober
enthusiasm
and
a
confidence
in
the
principles
upon
which
we
were
acting
which
sustained
us
at
every
step
of
the
difficult
undertaking
but
it
is
done
it
has
passed
from
our
hands
it
is
now
an
established
part
of
the
legislation
of
the
country
its
usefulness
its
effects
will
disclose
themselves
in
experience
what
chiefly
strikes
us
now
as
we
look
about
us
during
these
closing
days
of
a
year
which
will
be
forever
memorable
in
the
history
of
the
world
is
that
we
face
new
tasks
have
been
facing
them
these
six
months
must
face
them
in
the
months
to
comeface
them
without
partisan
feeling
like
men
who
have
forgotten
everything
but
a
common
duty
and
the
fact
that
we
are
representatives
of
a
great
people
whose
thought
is
not
of
us
but
of
what
america
owes
to
herself
and
to
all
mankind
in
such
circumstances
as
these
upon
which
we
look
amazed
and
anxious
war
has
interrupted
the
means
of
trade
not
only
but
also
the
processes
of
production
in
europe
it
is
destroying
men
and
resources
wholesale
and
upon
a
scale
unprecedented
and
appalling
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
the
time
is
near
if
it
be
not
already
at
hand
when
several
of
the
countries
of
europe
will
find
it
difficult
to
do
for
their
people
what
they
have
hitherto
been
always
easily
able
to
domany
essential
and
fundamental
things
at
any
rate
they
will
need
our
help
and
our
manifold
services
as
they
have
never
needed
them
before
and
we
should
be
ready
more
fit
and
ready
than
we
have
ever
been
it
is
of
equal
consequence
that
the
nations
whom
europe
has
usually
supplied
with
innumerable
articles
of
manufacture
and
commerce
of
which
they
are
in
constant
need
and
without
which
their
economic
development
halts
and
stands
still
can
now
get
only
a
small
part
of
what
they
formerly
imported
and
eagerly
look
to
us
to
supply
their
all
but
empty
markets
this
is
particularly
true
of
our
own
neighbors
the
states
great
and
small
of
central
and
south
america
their
lines
of
trade
have
hitherto
run
chiefly
athwart
the
seas
not
to
our
ports
but
to
the
ports
of
great
britain
and
of
the
older
continent
of
europe
i
do
not
stop
to
inquire
why
or
to
make
any
comment
on
probable
causes
what
interests
us
just
now
is
not
the
explanation
but
the
fact
and
our
duty
and
opportunity
in
the
presence
of
it
here
are
markets
which
we
must
supply
and
we
must
find
the
means
of
action
the
united
states
this
great
people
for
whom
we
speak
and
act
should
be
ready
as
never
before
to
serve
itself
and
to
serve
mankind
ready
with
its
resources
its
energies
its
forces
of
production
and
its
means
of
distribution
it
is
a
very
practical
matter
a
matter
of
ways
and
means
we
have
the
resources
but
are
we
fully
ready
to
use
them
and
if
we
can
make
ready
what
we
have
have
we
the
means
at
hand
to
distribute
it
we
are
not
fully
ready
neither
have
we
the
means
of
distribution
we
are
willing
but
we
are
not
fully
able
we
have
the
wish
to
serve
and
to
serve
greatly
generously
but
we
are
not
prepared
as
we
should
be
we
are
not
ready
to
mobilize
our
resources
at
once
we
are
not
prepared
to
use
them
immediately
and
at
their
best
without
delay
and
without
waste
to
speak
plainly
we
have
grossly
erred
in
the
way
in
which
we
have
stunted
and
hindered
the
development
of
our
merchant
marine
and
now
when
we
need
ships
we
have
not
got
them
we
have
year
after
year
debated
without
end
or
conclusion
the
best
policy
to
pursue
with
regard
to
the
use
of
the
ores
and
forests
and
water
powers
of
our
national
domain
in
the
rich
states
of
the
west
when
we
should
have
acted
and
they
are
still
locked
up
the
key
is
still
turned
upon
them
the
door
shut
fast
at
which
thousands
of
vigorous
men
full
of
initiative
knock
clamorously
for
admittance
the
water
power
of
our
navigable
streams
outside
the
national
domain
also
even
in
the
eastern
states
where
we
have
worked
and
planned
for
generations
is
still
not
used
as
it
might
be
because
we
will
and
we
wont
because
the
laws
we
have
made
do
not
intelligently
balance
encouragement
against
restraint
we
withhold
by
regulation
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
remedy
and
correct
these
mistakes
and
omissions
even
at
this
short
session
of
a
congress
which
would
certainly
seem
to
have
done
all
the
work
that
could
reasonably
be
expected
of
it
the
time
and
the
circumstances
are
extraordinary
and
so
must
our
efforts
be
also
fortunately
two
great
measures
finely
conceived
the
one
to
unlock
with
proper
safeguards
the
resources
of
the
national
domain
the
other
to
encourage
the
use
of
the
navigable
waters
outside
that
domain
for
the
generation
of
power
have
already
passed
the
house
of
representatives
and
are
ready
for
immediate
consideration
and
action
by
the
senate
with
the
deepest
earnestness
i
urge
their
prompt
passage
in
them
both
we
turn
our
backs
upon
hesitation
and
makeshift
and
formulate
a
genuine
policy
of
use
and
conservation
in
the
best
sense
of
those
words
we
owe
the
one
measure
not
only
to
the
people
of
that
great
western
country
for
whose
free
and
systematic
development
as
it
seems
to
me
our
legislation
has
done
so
little
but
also
to
the
people
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
we
as
clearly
owe
the
other
fulfillment
of
our
repeated
promises
that
the
water
power
of
the
country
should
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
be
put
at
the
disposal
of
great
industries
which
can
make
economical
and
profitable
use
of
it
the
rights
of
the
public
being
adequately
guarded
the
while
and
monopoly
in
the
use
prevented
to
have
begun
such
measures
and
not
completed
them
would
indeed
mar
the
record
of
this
great
congress
very
seriously
i
hope
and
confidently
believe
that
they
will
be
completed
and
there
is
another
great
piece
of
legislation
which
awaits
and
should
receive
the
sanction
of
the
senate
i
mean
the
bill
which
gives
a
larger
measure
of
selfgovernment
to
the
people
of
the
philippines
how
better
in
this
time
of
anxious
questioning
and
perplexed
policy
could
we
show
our
confidence
in
the
principles
of
liberty
as
the
source
as
well
as
the
expression
of
life
how
better
could
we
demonstrate
our
own
selfpossession
and
steadfastness
in
the
courses
of
justice
and
disinterestedness
than
by
thus
going
calmly
forward
to
fulfill
our
promises
to
a
dependent
people
who
will
now
look
more
anxiously
than
ever
to
see
whether
we
have
indeed
the
liberality
the
unselfishness
the
courage
the
faith
we
have
boasted
and
professed
i
can
not
believe
that
the
senate
will
let
this
great
measure
of
constructive
justice
await
the
action
of
another
congress
its
passage
would
nobly
crown
the
record
of
these
two
years
of
memorable
labor
but
i
think
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
this
does
not
complete
the
toll
of
our
duty
how
are
we
to
carry
our
goods
to
the
empty
markets
of
which
i
have
spoken
if
we
have
not
the
ships
how
are
we
to
build
up
a
great
trade
if
we
have
not
the
certain
and
constant
means
of
transportation
upon
which
all
profitable
and
useful
commerce
depends
and
how
are
we
to
get
the
ships
if
we
wait
for
the
trade
to
develop
without
them
to
correct
the
many
mistakes
by
which
we
have
discouraged
and
all
but
destroyed
the
merchant
marine
of
the
country
to
retrace
the
steps
by
which
we
have
it
seems
almost
deliberately
withdrawn
our
flag
from
the
seas
except
where
here
and
there
a
ship
of
war
is
bidden
carry
it
or
some
wandering
yacht
displays
it
would
take
a
long
time
and
involve
many
detailed
items
of
legislation
and
the
trade
which
we
ought
immediately
to
handle
would
disappear
or
find
other
channels
while
we
debated
the
items
the
case
is
not
unlike
that
which
confronted
us
when
our
own
continent
was
to
be
opened
up
to
settlement
and
industry
and
we
needed
long
lines
of
railway
extended
means
of
transportation
prepared
beforehand
if
development
was
not
to
lag
intolerably
and
wait
interminably
we
lavishly
subsidized
the
building
of
transcontinental
railroads
we
look
back
upon
that
with
regret
now
because
the
subsidies
led
to
many
scandals
of
which
we
are
ashamed
but
we
know
that
the
railroads
had
to
be
built
and
if
we
had
it
to
do
over
again
we
should
of
course
build
them
but
in
another
way
therefore
i
propose
another
way
of
providing
the
means
of
transportation
which
must
precede
not
tardily
follow
the
development
of
our
trade
with
our
neighbor
states
of
america
it
may
seem
a
reversal
of
the
natural
order
of
things
but
it
is
true
that
the
routes
of
trade
must
be
actually
openedby
many
ships
and
regular
sailings
and
moderate
chargesbefore
streams
of
merchandise
will
flow
freely
and
profitably
through
them
hence
the
pending
shipping
bill
discussed
at
the
last
session
but
as
yet
passed
by
neither
house
in
my
judgment
such
legislation
is
imperatively
needed
and
can
not
wisely
be
postponed
the
government
must
open
these
gates
of
trade
and

open
them
wide
open
them
before
it
is
altogether
profitable
to
open
them
or
altogether
reasonable
to
ask
private
capital
to
open
them
at
a
venture
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
government
monopolizing
the
field
it
should
take
action
to
make
it
certain
that
transportation
at
reasonable
rates
will
be
promptly
provided
even
where
the
carriage
is
not
at
first
profitable
and
then
when
the
carriage
has
become
sufficiently
profitable
to
attract
and
engage
private
capital
and
engage
it
in
abundance
the
government
ought
to
withdraw
i
very
earnestly
hope
that
the
congress
will
be
of
this
opinion
and
that
both
houses
will
adopt
this
exceedingly
important
bill
the
great
subject
of
rural
credits
still
remains
to
be
dealt
with
and
it
is
a
matter
of
deep
regret
that
the
difficulties
of
the
subject
have
seemed
to
render
it
impossible
to
complete
a
bill
for
passage
at
this
session
but
it
can
not
be
perfected
yet
and
therefore
there
are
no
other
constructive
measures
the
necessity
for
which
i
will
at
this
time
call
your
attention
to
but
i
would
be
negligent
of
a
very
manifest
duty
were
i
not
to
call
the
attention
of
the
senate
to
the
fact
that
the
proposed
convention
for
safety
at
sea
awaits
its
confirmation
and
that
the
limit
fixed
in
the
convention
itself
for
its
acceptance
is
the
last
day
of
the
present
month
the
conference
in
which
this
convention
originated
was
called
by
the
united
states
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
played
a
very
influential
part
indeed
in
framing
the
provisions
of
the
proposed
convention
and
those
provisions
are
in
themselves
for
the
most
part
admirable
it
would
hardly
be
consistent
with
the
part
we
have
played
in
the
whole
matter
to
let
it
drop
and
go
by
the
board
as
if
forgotten
and
neglected
it
was
ratified
in
may
by
the
german
government
and
in
august
by
the
parliament
of
great
britain
it
marks
a
most
hopeful
and
decided
advance
in
international
civilization
we
should
show
our
earnest
good
faith
in
a
great
matter
by
adding
our
own
acceptance
of
it
there
is
another
matter
of
which
i
must
make
special
mention
if
i
am
to
discharge
my
conscience
lest
it
should
escape
your
attention
it
may
seem
a
very
small
thing
it
affects
only
a
single
item
of
appropriation
but
many
human
lives
and
many
great
enterprises
hang
upon
it
it
is
the
matter
of
making
adequate
provision
for
the
survey
and
charting
of
our
coasts
it
is
immediately
pressing
and
exigent
in
connection
with
the
immense
coast
line
of
alaska
a
coast
line
greater
than
that
of
the
united
states
themselves
though
it
is
also
very
important
indeed
with
regard
to
the
older
coasts
of
the
continent
we
can
not
use
our
great
alaskan
domain
ships
will
not
ply
thither
if
those
coasts
and
their
many
hidden
dangers
are
not
thoroughly
surveyed
and
charted
the
work
is
incomplete
at
almost
every
point
ships
and
lives
have
been
lost
in
threading
what
were
supposed
to
be
wellknown
main
channels
we
have
not
provided
adequate
vessels
or
adequate
machinery
for
the
survey
and
charting
we
have
used
old
vessels
that
were
not
big
enough
or
strong
enough
and
which
were
so
nearly
unseaworthy
that
our
inspectors
would
not
have
allowed
private
owners
to
send
them
to
sea
this
is
a
matter
which
as
i
have
said
seems
small
but
is
in
reality
very
great
its
importance
has
only
to
be
looked
into
to
be
appreciated
before
i
close
may
i
say
a
few
words
upon
two
topics
much
discussed
out
of
doors
upon
which
it
is
highly
important
that
our
judgment
should
be
clear
definite
and
steadfast
one
of
these
is
economy
in
government
expenditures
the
duty
of
economy
is
not
debatable
it
is
manifest
and
imperative
in
the
appropriations
we
pass
we
are
spending
the
money
of
the
great
people
whose
servants
we
arenot
our
own
we
are
trustees
and
responsible
stewards
in
the
spending
the
only
thing
debatable
and
upon
which
we
should
be
careful
to
make
our
thought
and
purpose
clear
is
the
kind
of
economy
demanded
of
us
i
assert
with
the
greatest
confidence
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
not
jealous
of
the
amount
their
government
costs
if
they
are
sure
that
they
get
what
they
need
and
desire
for
the
outlay
that
the
money
is
being
spent
for
objects
of
which
they
approve
and
that
it
is
being
applied
with
good
business
sense
and
management
governments
grow
piecemeal
both
in
their
tasks
and
in
the
means
by
which
those
tasks
are
to
be
performed
and
very
few
governments
are
organized
i
venture
to
say
as
wise
and
experienced
business
men
would
organize
them
if
they
had
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
to
write
upon
certainly
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
not
i
think
that
it
is
generally
agreed
that
there
should
be
a
systematic
reorganization
and
reassembling
of
its
parts
so
as
to
secure
greater
efficiency
and
effect
considerable
savings
in
expense
but
the
amount
of
money
saved
in
that
way
would
i
believe
though
no
doubt
considerable
in
itself
running
it
may
be
into
the
millions
be
relatively
smallsmall
i
mean
in
proportion
to
the
total
necessary
outlays
of
the
government
it
would
be
thoroughly
worth
effecting
as
every
saving
would
great
or
small
our
duty
is
not
altered
by
the
scale
of
the
saving
but
my
point
is
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
do
not
wish
to
curtail
the
activities
of
this
government
they
wish
rather
to
enlarge
them
and
with
every
enlargement
with
the
mere
growth
indeed
of
the
country
itself
there
must
come
of
course
the
inevitable
increase
of
expense
the
sort
of
economy
we
ought
to
practice
may
be
effected
and
ought
to
be
effected
by
a
careful
study
and
assessment
of
the
tasks
to
be
performed
and
the
money
spent
ought
to
be
made
to
yield
the
best
possible
returns
in
efficiency
and
achievement
and
like
good
stewards
we
should
so
account
for
every
dollar
of
our
appropriations
as
to
make
it
perfectly
evident
what
it
was
spent
for
and
in
what
way
it
was
spent
it
is
not
expenditure
but
extravagance
that
we
should
fear
being
criticized
for
not
paying
for
the
legitimate
enterprise
and
undertakings
of
a
great
government
whose
people
command
what
it
should
do
but
adding
what
will
benefit
only
a
few
or
pouring
money
out
for
what
need
not
have
been
undertaken
at
all
or
might
have
been
postponed
or
better
and
more
economically
conceived
and
carried
out
the
nation
is
not
niggardly
it
is
very
generous
it
will
chide
us
only
if
we
forget
for
whom
we
pay
money
out
and
whose
money
it
is
we
pay
these
are
large
and
general
standards
but
they
are
not
very
difficult
of
application
to
particular
cases
the
other
topic
i
shall
take
leave
to
mention
goes
deeper
into
the
principles
of
our
national
life
and
policy
it
is
the
subject
of
national
defense
it
can
not
be
discussed
without
first
answering
some
very
searching
questions
it
is
said
in
some
quarters
that
we
are
not
prepared
for
war
what
is
meant
by
being
prepared
is
it
meant
that
we
are
not
ready
upon
brief
notice
to
put
a
nation
in
the
field
a
nation
of
men
trained
to
arms
of
course
we
are
not
ready
to
do
that
and
we
shall
never
be
in
time
of
peace
so
long
as
we
retain
our
present
political
principles
and
institutions
and
what
is
it
that
it
is
suggested
we
should
be
prepared
to
do
to
defend
ourselves
against
attack
we
have
always
found
means
to
do
that
and
shall
find
them
whenever
it
is
necessary
without
calling
our
people
away
from
their
necessary
tasks
to
render
compulsory
military
service
in
times
of
peace
allow
me
to
speak
with
great
plainness
and
directness
upon
this
great
matter
and
to
avow
my
convictions
with
deep
earnestness
i
have
tried
to
know
what
america
is
what
her
people
think
what
they
are
what
they
most
cherish
and
hold
dear
i
hope
that
some
of
their
finer
passions
are
in
my
own
heartsome
of
the
great
conceptions
and
desires
which
gave
birth
to
this
government
and
which
have
made
the
voice
of
this
people
a
voice
of
peace
and
hope
and
liberty
among
the
peoples
of
the
world
and
that
speaking
my
own
thoughts
i
shall
at
least
in
part
speak
theirs
also
however
faintly
and
inadequately
upon
this
vital
matter
we
are
at
peace
with
all
the
world
no
one
who
speaks
counsel
based
on
fact
or
drawn
from
a
just
and
candid
interpretation
of
realities
can
say
that
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
from
any
quarter
our
independence
or
the
integrity
of
our
territory
is
threatened
dread
of
the
power
of
any
other
nation
we
are
incapable
of
we
are
not
jealous
of
rivalry
in
the
fields
of
commerce
or
of
any
other
peaceful
achievement
we
mean
to
live
our
own
lives
as
we
will
but
we
mean
also
to
let
live
we
are
indeed
a
true
friend
to
all
the
nations
of
the
world
because
we
threaten
none
covet
the
possessions
of
none
desire
the
overthrow
of
none
our
friendship
can
be
accepted
and
is
accepted
without
reservation
because
it
is
offered
in
a
spirit
and
for
a
purpose
which
no
one
need
ever
question
or
suspect
therein
lies
our
greatness
we
are
the
champions
of
peace
and
of
concord
and
we
should
be
very
jealous
of
this
distinction
which
we
have
sought
to
earn
just
now
we
should
be
particularly
jealous
of
it
because
it
is
our
dearest
present
hope
that
this
character
and
reputation
may
presently
in
gods
providence
bring
us
an
opportunity
such
as
has
seldom
been
vouchsafed
any
nation
the
opportunity
to
counsel
and
obtain
peace
in
the
world
and
reconciliation
and
a
healing
settlement
of
many
a
matter
that
has
cooled
and
interrupted
the
friendship
of
nations
this
is
the
time
above
all
others
when
we
should
wish
and
resolve
to
keep
our
strength
by
selfpossession
our
influence
by
preserving
our
ancient
principles
of
action
from
the
first
we
have
had
a
clear
and
settled
policy
with
regard
to
military
establishments
we
never
have
had
and
while
we
retain
our
present
principles
and
ideals
we
never
shall
have
a
large
standing
army
if
asked
are
you
ready
to
defend
yourselves
we
reply
most
assuredly
to
the
utmost
and
yet
we
shall
not
turn
america
into
a
military
camp
we
will
not
ask
our
young
men
to
spend
the
best
years
of
their
lives
making
soldiers
of
themselves
there
is
another
sort
of
energy
in
us
it
will
know
how
to
declare
itself
and
make
itself
effective
should
occasion
arise
an
d
especially
when
half
the
world
is
on
fire
we
shall
be
careful
to
make
our
moral
insurance
against
the
spread
of
the
conflagration
very
definite
and
certain
and
adequate
indeed
let
us
remind
ourselves
therefore
of
the
only
thing
we
can
do
or
will
do
we
must
depend
in
every
time
of
national
peril
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
not
upon
a
standing
army
nor
yet
upon
a
reserve
army
but
upon
a
citizenry
trained
and
accustomed
to
arms
it
will
be
right
enough
right
american
policy
based
upon
our
accustomed
principles
and
practices
to
provide
a
system
by
which
every
citizen
who
will
volunteer
for
the
training
may
be
made
familiar
with
the
use
of
modern
arms
the
rudiments
of
drill
and
maneuver
and
the
maintenance
and
sanitation
of
camps
we
should
encourage
such
training
and
make
it
a
means
of
discipline
which
our
young
men
will
learn
to
value
it
is
right
that
we
should
provide
it
not
only
but
that
we
should
make
it
as
attractive
as
possible
and
so
induce
our
young
men
to
undergo
it
at
such
times
as
they
can
command
a
little
freedom
and
can
seek
the
physical
development
they
need
for
mere
healths
sake
if
for
nothing
more
every
means
by
which
such
things
can
be
stimulated
is
legitimate
and
such
a
method
smacks
of
true
american
ideas
it
is
right
too
that
the
national
guard
of
the
states
should
be
developed
and
strengthened
by
every
means
which
is
not
inconsistent
with
our
obligations
to
our
own
people
or
with
the
established
policy
of
our
government
and
this
also
not
because
the
time
or
occasion
specially
calls
for
such
measures
but
because
it
should
be
our
constant
policy
to
make
these
provisions
for
our
national
peace
and
safety
more
than
this
carries
with
it
a
reversal
of
the
whole
history
and
character
of
our
polity
more
than
this
proposed
at
this
time
permit
me
to
say
would
mean
merely
that
we
had
lost
our
selfpossession
that
we
had
been
thrown
off
our
balance
by
a
war
with
which
we
have
nothing
to
do
whose
causes
can
not
touch
us
whose
very
existence
affords
us
opportunities
of
friendship
and
disinterested
service
which
should
make
us
ashamed
of
any
thought
of
hostility
or
fearful
preparation
for
trouble
this
is
assuredly
the
opportunity
for
which
a
people
and
a
government
like
ours
were
raised
up
the
opportunity
not
only
to
speak
but
actually
to
embody
and
exemplify
the
counsels
of
peace
and
amity
and
the
lasting
concord
which
is
based
on
justice
and
fair
and
generous
dealing
a
powerful
navy
we
have
always
regarded
as
our
proper
and
natural
means
of
defense
and
it
has
always
been
of
defense
that
we
have
thought
never
of
aggression
or
of
conquest
but
who
shall
tell
us
now
what
sort
of
navy
to
build
we
shall
take
leave
to
be
strong
upon
the
seas
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
and
there
will
be
no
thought
of
offense
or
of
provocation
in
that
our
ships
are
our
natural
bulwarks
when
will
the
experts
tell
us
just
what
kind
we
should
constructand
when
will
they
be
right
for
ten
years
together
if
the
relative
efficiency
of
craft
of
different
kinds
and
uses
continues
to
change
as
we
have
seen
it
change
under
our
very
eyes
in
these
last
few
months
but
i
turn
away
from
the
subject
it
is
not
new
there
is
no
new
need
to
discuss
it
we
shall
not
alter
our
attitude
toward
it
because
some
amongst
us
are
nervous
and
excited
we
shall
easily
and
sensibly
agree
upon
a
policy
of
defense
the
question
has
not
changed
its
aspects
because
the
times
are
not
normal
our
policy
will
not
be
for
an
occasion
it
will
be
conceived
as
a
permanent
and
settled
thing
which
we
will
pursue
at
all
seasons
without
haste
and
after
a
fashion
perfectly
consistent
with
the
peace
of
the
world
the
abiding
friendship
of
states
and
the
unhampered
freedom
of
all
with
whom
we
deal
let
there
be
no
misconception
the
country
has
been
misinformed
we
have
not
been
negligent
of
national
defense
we
are
not
unmindful
of
the
great
responsibility
resting
upon
us
we
shall
learn
and
profit
by
the
lesson
of
every
experience
and
every
new
circumstance
and
what
is
needed
will
be
adequately
done
i
close
as
i
began
by
reminding
you
of
the
great
tasks
and
duties
of
peace
which
challenge
our
best
powers
and
invite
us
to
build
what
will
last
the
tasks
to
which
we
can
address
ourselves
now
and
at
all
times
with
freehearted
zest
and
with
all
the
finest
gifts
of
constructive
wisdom
we
possess
to
develop
our
life
and
our
resources
to
supply
our
own
people
and
the
people
of
the
world
as
their
need
arises
from
the
abundant
plenty
of
our
fields
and
our
marts
of
trade
to
enrich
the
commerce
of
our
own
states
and
of
the
world
with
the
products
of
our
mines
our
farms
and
our
factories
with
the
creations
of
our
thought
and
the
fruits
of
our
characterthis
is
what
will
hold
our
attention
and
our
enthusiasm
steadily
now
and
in
the
years
to
come
as
we
strive
to
show
in
our
life
as
a
nation
what
liberty
and
the
inspirations
of
an
emancipated
spirit
may
do
for
men
and
for
societies
for
individuals
for
states
and
for
mankind

gentlemen
of
the
congress
in
pursuance
of
my
constitutional
duty
to
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
i
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
on
several
matters
which
ought
as
it
seems
to
me
particularly
to
engage
the
attention
of
your
honorable
bodies
as
of
all
who
study
the
welfare
and
progress
of
the
nation
i
shall
ask
your
indulgence
if
i
venture
to
depart
in
some
degree
from
the
usual
custom
of
setting
before
you
in
formal
review
the
many
matters
which
have
engaged
the
attention
and
called
for
the
action
of
the
several
departments
of
the
government
or
which
look
to
them
for
early
treatment
in
the
future
because
the
list
is
long
very
long
and
would
suffer
in
the
abbreviation
to
which
i
should
have
to
subject
it
i
shall
submit
to
you
the
reports
of
the
heads
of
the
several
departments
in
which
these
subjects
are
set
forth
in
careful
detail
and
beg
that
they
may
receive
the
thoughtful
attention
of
your
committees
and
of
all
members
of
the
congress
who
may
have
the
leisure
to
study
them
their
obvious
importance
as
constituting
the
very
substance
of
the
business
of
the
government
makes
comment
and
emphasis
on
my
part
unnecessary
the
country
i
am
thankful
to
say
is
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
many
happy
manifestations
multiply
about
us
of
a
growing
cordiality
and
sense
of
community
of
interest
among
the
nations
foreshadowing
an
age
of
settled
peace
and
good
will
more
and
more
readily
each
decade
do
the
nations
manifest
their
willingness
to
bind
themselves
by
solemn
treaty
to
the
processes
of
peace
the
processes
of
frankness
and
fair
concession
so
far
the
united
states
has
stood
at
the
front
of
such
negotiations
she
will
i
earnestly
hope
and
confidently
believe
give
fresh
proof
of
her
sincere
adherence
to
the
cause
of
international
friendship
by
ratifying
the
several
treaties
of
arbitration
awaiting
renewal
by
the
senate
in
addition
to
these
it
has
been
the
privilege
of
the
department
of
state
to
gain
the
assent
in
principle
of
no
less
than
nations
representing
fourfifths
of
the
population
of
the
world
to
the
negotiation
of
treaties
by
which
it
shall
be
agreed
that
whenever
differences
of
interest
or
of
policy
arise
which
can
not
be
resolved
by
the
ordinary
processes
of
diplomacy
they
shall
be
publicly
analyzed
discussed
and
reported
upon
by
a
tribunal
chosen
by
the
parties
before
either
nation
determines
its
course
of
action
there
is
only
one
possible
standard
by
which
to
determine
controversies
between
the
united
states
and
other
nations
and
that
is
compounded
of
these
two
elements
our
own
honor
and
our
obligations
to
the
peace
of
the
world
a
test
so
compounded
ought
easily
to
be
made
to
govern
both
the
establishment
of
new
treaty
obligations
and
the
interpretation
of
those
already
assumed
there
is
but
one
cloud
upon
our
horizon
that
has
shown
itself
to
the
south
of
us
and
hangs
over
mexico
there
can
be
no
certain
prospect
of
peace
in
america
until
gen
huerta
has
surrendered
his
usurped
authority
in
mexico
until
it
is
understood
on
all
hands
indeed
that
such
pretended
governments
will
not
be
countenanced
or
dealt
with
bythe
government
of
the
united
states
we
are
the
friends
of
constitutional
government
in
america
we
are
more
than
its
friends
we
are
its
champions
because
in
no
other
way
can
our
neighbors
to
whom
we
would
wish
in
every
way
to
make
proof
of
our
friendship
work
out
their
own
development
in
peace
and
liberty
mexico
has
no
government
the
attempt
to
maintain
one
at
the
city
of
mexico
has
broken
down
and
a
mere
military
despotism
has
been
set
up
which
has
hardly
more
than
the
semblance
of
national
authority
it
originated
in
the
usurpation
of
victoriano
huerta
who
after
a
brief
attempt
to
play
the
part
of
constitutional
president
has
at
last
cast
aside
even
the
pretense
of
legal
right
and
declared
himself
dictator
as
a
consequence
a
condition
of
affairs
now
exists
in
mexico
which
has
made
it
doubtful
whether
even
the
most
elementary
and
fundamental
rights
either
of
her
own
people
or
of
the
citizens
of
other
countries
resident
within
her
territory
can
long
be
successfully
safeguarded
and
which
threatens
if
long
continued
to
imperil
the
interests
of
peace
order
and
tolerable
life
in
the
lands
immediately
to
the
south
of
us
even
if
the
usurper
had
succeeded
in
his
purposes
in
despite
of
the
constitution
of
the
republic
and
the
rights
of
its
people
he
would
have
set
up
nothing
but
a
precarious
and
hateful
power
which
could
have
lasted
but
a
little
while
and
whose
eventual
downfall
would
have
left
the
country
in
a
more
deplorable
condition
than
ever
but
he
has
not
succeeded
he
has
forfeited
the
respect
and
the
moral
support
even
of
those
who
were
at
one
time
willing
to
see
him
succeed
little
by
little
he
has
been
completely
isolated
by
a
little
every
day
his
power
and
prestige
are
crumbling
and
the
collapse
is
not
far
away
we
shall
not
i
believe
be
obliged
to
alter
our
policy
of
watchful
waiting
and
then
when
the
end
comes
we
shall
hope
to
see
constitutional
order
restored
in
distressed
mexico
by
the
concert
and
energy
of
such
of
her
leaders
as
prefer
the
liberty
of
their
people
to
their
own
ambitions
i
turn
to
matters
of
domestic
concern
you
already
have
under
consideration
a
bill
for
the
reform
of
our
system
of
banking
and
currency
for
which
the
country
waits
with
impatience
as
for
something
fundamental
to
its
whole
business
life
and
necessary
to
set
credit
free
from
arbitrary
and
artificial
restraints
i
need
not
say
how
earnestly
i
hope
for
its
early
enactment
into
law
i
take
leave
to
beg
that
the
whole
energy
and
attention
of
the
senate
be
concentrated
upon
it
till
the
matter
is
successfully
disposed
of
and
yet
i
feel
that
the
request
is
not
neededthat
the
members
of
that
great
house
need
no
urging
in
this
service
to
the
country
i
present
to
you
in
addition
the
urgent
necessity
that
special
provision
be
made
also
for
facilitating
the
credits
needed
by
the
farmers
of
the
country
the
pending
currency
bill
does
the
farmers
a
great
service
it
puts
them
upon
an
equal
footing
with
other
business
men
and
masters
of
enterprise
as
it
should
and
upon
its
passage
they
will
find
themselves
quit
of
many
of
the
difficulties
which
now
hamper
them
in
the
field
of
credit
the
farmers
of
course
ask
and
should
be
given
no
special
privilege
such
as
extending
to
them
the
credit
of
the
government
itself
what
they
need
and
should
obtain
is
legislation
which
will
make
their
own
abundant
and
substantial
credit
resources
available
as
a
foundation
for
joint
concerted
local
action
in
their
own
behalf
in
getting
the
capital
they
must
use
it
is
to
this
we
should
now
address
ourselves
it
has
singularly
enough
come
to
pass
that
we
have
allowed
the
industry
of
our
farms
to
lag
behind
the
other
activities
of
the
country
in
its
development
i
need
not
stop
to
tell
you
how
fundamental
to
the
life
of
the
nation
is
the
production
of
its
food
our
thoughts
may
ordinarily
be
concentrated
upon
the
cities
and
the
hives
of
industry
upon
the
cries
of
the
crowded
market
place
and
the
clangor
of
the
factory
but
it
is
from
the
quiet
interspaces
of
the
open
valleys
and
the
free
hillsides
that
we
draw
the
sources
of
life
and
of
prosperity
from
the
farm
and
the
ranch
from
the
forest
and
the
mine
without
these
every
street
would
be
silent
every
office
deserted
every
factory
fallen
into
disrepair
and
yet
the
farmer
does
not
stand
upon
the
same
footing
with
the
forester
and
the
miner
in
the
market
of
credit
he
is
the
servant
of
the
seasons
nature
determines
how
long
he
must
wait
for
his
crops
and
will
not
be
hurried
in
her
processes
he
may
give
his
note
but
the
season
of
its
maturity
depends
upon
the
season
when
his
crop
matures
lies
at
the
gates
of
the
market
where
his
products
are
sold
and
the
security
he
gives
is
of
a
character
not
known
in
the
brokers
office
or
as
familiarly
as
it
might
be
on
the
counter
of
the
banker
the
agricultural
department
of
the
government
is
seeking
to
assist
as
never
before
to
make
farming
an
efficient
business
of
wide
cooperative
effort
in
quick
touch
with
the
markets
for
foodstuffs
the
farmers
and
the
government
will
henceforth
work
together
as
real
partners
in
this
field
where
we
now
begin
to
see
our
way
very
clearly
and
where
many
intelligent
plans
are
already
being
put
into
execution
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
has
by
a
timely
and
wellconsidered
distribution
of
its
deposits
facilitated
the
moving
of
the
crops
in
the
present
season
and
prevented
the
scarcity
of
available
funds
too
often
experienced
at
such
times
but
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
depend
upon
extraordinary
expedients
we
must
add
the
means
by
which
the
farmer
may
make
his
credit
constantly
and
easily
available
and
command
when
he
will
the
capital
by
which
to
support
and
expand
his
business
we
lag
behind
many
other
great
countries
of
the
modern
world
in
attempting
to
do
this
systems
of
rural
credit
have
been
studied
and
developed
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
while
we
left
our
farmers
to
shift
for
themselves
in
the
ordinary
money
market
you
have
but
to
look
about
you
in
any
rural
district
to
see
the
result
the
handicap
and
embarrassment
which
have
been
put
upon
those
who
produce
our
food
conscious
of
this
backwardness
and
neglect
on
our
part
the
congress
recently
authorized
the
creation
of
a
special
commission
to
study
the
various
systems
of
rural
credit
which
have
been
put
into
operation
in
europe
and
this
commission
is
already
prepared
to
report
its
report
ought
to
make
it
easier
for
us
to
determine
what
methods
will
be
best
suited
to
our
own
farmers
i
hope
and
believe
that
the
committees
of
the
senate
and
house
will
address
themselves
to
this
matter
with
the
most
fruitful
results
and
i
believe
that
the
studies
and
recently
formed
plans
of
the
department
of
agriculture
may
be
made
to
serve
them
very
greatly
in
their
work
of
framing
appropriate
and
adequate
legislation
it
would
be
indiscreet
and
presumptuous
in
anyone
to
dogmatize
upon
so
great
and
manysided
a
question
but
i
feel
confident
that
common
counsel
will
produce
the

results
we
must
all
desire
turn
from
the
farm
to
the
world
of
business
which
centers
in
the
city
and
in
the
factory
and
i
think
that
all
thoughtful
observers
will
agree
that
the
immediate
service
we
owe
the
business
communities
of
the
country
is
to
prevent
private
monopoly
more
effectually
than
it
has
yet
been
prevented
i
think
it
will
be
easily
agreed
that
we
should
let
the
sherman
antitrust
law
stand
unaltered
as
it
is
with
its
debatable
ground
about
it
but
that
we
should
as
much
as
possible
reduce
the
area
of
that
debatable
ground
by
further
and
more
explicit
legislation
and
should
also
supplement
that
great
act
by
legislation
which
will
not
only
clarify
it
but
also
facilitate
its
administration
and
make
it
fairer
to
all
concerned
no
doubt
we
shall
all
wish
and
the
country
will
expect
this
to
be
the
central
subject
of
our
deliberations
during
the
present
session
but
it
is
a
subject
so
manysided
and
so
deserving
of
careful
and
discriminating
discussion
that
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
addressing
you
upon
it
in
a
special
message
at
a
later
date
than
this
it
is
of
capital
importance
that
the
business
men
of
this
country
should
be
relieved
of
all
uncertainties
of
law
with
regard
to
their
enterprises
and
investments
and
a
clear
path
indicated
which
they
can
travel
without
anxiety
it
is
as
important
that
they
should
be
relieved
of
embarrassment
and
set
free
to
prosper
as
that
private
monopoly
should
be
destroyed
the
ways
of
action
should
be
thrown
wide
open
i
turn
to
a
subject
which
i
hope
can
be
handled
promptly
and
without
serious
controversy
of
any
kind
i
mean
the
method
of
selecting
nominees
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
i
feel
confident
that
i
do
not
misinterpret
the
wishes
or
the
expectations
of
the
country
when
i
urge
the
prompt
enactment
of
legislation
which
will
provide
for
primary
elections
throughout
the
country
at
which
the
voters
of
the
several
parties
may
choose
their
nominees
for
the
presidency
without
the
intervention
of
nominating
conventions
i
venture
the
suggestion
that
this
legislation
should
provide
for
the
retention
of
party
conventions
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
declaring
and
accepting
the
verdict
of
the
primaries
and
formulating
the
platforms
of
the
parties
and
i
suggest
that
these
conventions
should
consist
not
of
delegates
chosen
for
this
single
purpose
but
of
the
nominees
for
congress
the
nominees
for
vacant
seats
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
the
senators
whose
terms
have
not
yet
closed
the
national
committees
and
the
candidates
for
the
presidency
themselves
in
order
that
platforms
may
be
framed
by
those
responsible
to
the
people
for
carrying
them
into
effect
these
are
all
matters
of
vital
domestic
concern
and
besides
them
outside
the
charmed
circle
of
our
own
national
life
in
which
our
affections
command
us
as
well
as
our
consciences
there
stand
out
our
obligations
toward
our
territories
over
sea
here
we
are
trustees
porto
rico
hawaii
the
philippines
are
ours
indeed
but
not
ours
to
do
what
we
please
with
such
territories
once
regarded
as
mere
possessions
are
no
longer
to
be
selfishly
exploited
they
are
part
of
the
domain
of
public
conscience
and
of
serviceable
and
enlightened
statesmanship
we
must
administer
them
for
the
people
who
live
in
them
and
with
the
same
sense
of
responsibility
to
them
as
toward
our
own
people
in
our
domestic
affairs
no
doubt
we
shall
successfully
enough
bind
porto
rico
and
the
hawaiian
islands
to
ourselves
by
ties
of
justice
and
interest
and
affection
but
the
performance
of
our
duty
toward
the
philippines
is
a
more
difficult
and
debatable
matter
we
can
satisfy
the
obligations
of
generous
justice
toward
the
people
of
porto
rico
by
giving
them
the
ample
and
familiar
rights
and
privileges
accorded
our
own
citizens
in
our
own
territories
and
our
obligations
toward
the
people
of
hawaii
by
perfecting
the
provisions
for
selfgovernment
already
granted
them
but
in
the
philippines
we
must
go
further
we
must
hold
steadily
in
view
their
ultimate
independence
and
we
must
move
toward
the
time
of
that
independence
as
steadily
as
the
way
can
be
cleared
and
the
foundations
thoughtfully
and
permanently
laid
acting
under
the
authority
conferred
upon
the
president
by
congress
i
have
already
accorded
the
people
of
the
islands
a
majority
in
both
houses
of
their
legislative
body
by
appointing
five
instead
of
four
native
citizens
to
the
membership
of
the
commission
i
believe
that
in
this
way
we
shall
make
proof
of
their
capacity
in
counsel
and
their
sense
of
responsibility
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
and
that
the
success
of
this
step
will
be
sure
to
clear
our
view
for
the
steps
which
are
to
follow
step
by
step
we
should
extend
and
perfect
the
system
of
selfgovernment
in
the
islands
making
test
of
them
and
modifying
them
as
experience
discloses
their
successes
and
their
failures
that
we
should
more
and
more
put
under
the
control
of
the
native
citizens
of
the
archipelago
the
essential
instruments
of
their
life
their
local
instrumentalities
of
government
their
schools
all
the
common
interests
of
their
communities
and
so
by
counsel
and
experience
set
up
a
government
which
all
the
world
will
see
to
be
suitable
to
a
people
whose
affairs
are
under
their
own
control
at
last
i
hope
and
believe
we
are
beginning
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
filipino
peoples
by
their
counsel
and
experience
rather
than
by
our
own
we
shall
learn
how
best
to
serve
them
and
how
soon
it
will
be
possible
and
wise
to
withdraw
our
supervision
let
us
once
find
the
path
and
set
out
with
firm
and
confident
tread
upon
it
and
we
shall
not
wander
from
it
or
linger
upon
it
a
duty
faces
us
with
regard
to
alaska
which
seems
to
me
very
pressing
and
very
imperative
perhaps
i
should
say
a
double
duty
for
it
concerns
both
the
political
and
the
material
development
of
the
territory
the
people
of
alaska
should
be
given
the
full
territorial
form
of
government
and
alaska
as
a
storehouse
should
be
unlocked
one
key
to
it
is
a
system
of
railways
these
the
government
should
itself
build
and
administer
and
the
ports
and
terminals
it
should
itself
control
in
the
interest
of
all
who
wish
to
use
them
for
the
service
and
development
of
the
country
and
its
people
but
the
construction
of
railways
is
only
the
first
step
is
only
thrusting
in
the
key
to
the
storehouse
and
throwing
back
the
lock
and
opening
the
door
how
the
tempting
resources
of
the
country
are
to
be
exploited
is
another
matter
to
which
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
from
time
to
time
calling
your
attention
for
it
is
a
policy
which
must
be
worked
out
by
wellconsidered
stages
not
upon
theory
but
upon
lines
of
practical
expediency
it
is
part
of
our
general
problem
of
conservation
we
have
a
freer
hand
in
working
out
the
problem
in
alaska
than
in
the
states
of
the
union
and
yet
the
principle
and
object
are
the
same
wherever
we
touch
it
we
must
use
the
resources
of
the
country
not
lock
them
up
there
need
be
no
conflict
or
jealousy
as
between
state
and
federal
authorities
for
there
can
be
no
essential
difference
of
purpose
between
them
the
resources
in
question
must
be
used
but
not
destroyed
or
wasted
used
but
not
monopolized
upon
any
narrow
idea
of
individual
rights
as
against
the
abiding
interests
of
communities
that
a
policy
can
be
worked
out
by
conference
and
concession
which
will
release
these
resources
and
yet
not
jeopard
or
dissipate
them
i
for
one
have
no
doubt
and
it
can
be
done
on
lines
of
regulation
which
need
be
no
less
acceptable
to
the
people
and
governments
of
the
states
concerned
than
to
the
people
and
government
of
the
nation
at
large
whose
heritage
these
resources
are
we
must
bend
our
counsels
to
this
end
a
common
purpose
ought
to
make
agreement
easy
three
or
four
matters
of
special
importance
and
significance
i
beg
that
you
will
permit
me
to
mention
in
closing
our
bureau
of
mines
ought
to
be
equipped
and
empowered
to
render
even
more
effectual
service
than
it
renders
now
in
improving
the
conditions
of
mine
labor
and
making
the
mines
more
economically
productive
as
well
as
more
safe
this
is
an
allimportant
part
of
the
work
of
conservation
and
the
conservation
of
human
life
and
energy
lies
even
nearer
to
our
interests
than
the
preservation
from
waste
of
our
material
resources
we
owe
it
in
mere
justice
to
the
railway
employees
of
the
country
to
provide
for
them
a
fair
and
effective
employers
liability
act
and
a
law
that
we
can
stand
by
in
this
matter
will
be
no
less
to
the
advantage
of
those
who
administer
the
railroads
of
the
country
than
to
the
advantage
of
those
whom
they
employ
the
experience
of
a
large
number
of
the
states
abundantly
proves
that
we
ought
to
devote
ourselves
to
meeting
pressing
demands
of
plain
justice
like
this
as
earnestly
as
to
the
accomplishment
of
political
and
economic
reforms
social
justice
comes
first
law
is
the
machinery
for
its
realization
and
is
vital
only
as
it
expresses
and
embodies
it
an
international
congress
for
the
discussion
of
all
questions
that
affect
safety
at
sea
is
now
sitting
in
london
at
the
suggestion
of
our
own
government
so
soon
as
the
conclusions
of
that
congress
can
be
learned
and
considered
we
ought
to
address
ourselves
among
other
things
to
the
prompt
alleviation
of
the
very
unsafe
unjust
and
burdensome
conditions
which
now
surround
the
employment
of
sailors
and
render
it
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
the
services
of
spirited
and
competent
men
such
as
every
ship
needs
if
it
is
to
be
safely
handled
and
brought
to
port
may
i
not
express
the
very
real
pleasare
i
have
experienced
in
cooperating
with
this
congress
and
sharing
with
it
the
labors
of
common
service
to
which
it
has
devoted
itself
so
unreservedly
during
the
past
seven
months
of
uncomplaining
concentration
upon
the
business
of
legislation
surely
it
is
a
proper
and
pertinent
part
of
my
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
to
express
my
admiration
for
the
diligence
the
good
temper
and
the
full
comprehension
of
public
duty
which
has
already
been
manifested
by
both
the
houses
and
i
hope
that
it
may
not
be
deemed
an
impertinent
intrusion
of
myself
int
o
the
picture
if
i
say
with
how
much
and
how
constant
satisfaction
i
have
availed
myself
of
the
privilege
of
putting
my
time
and
energy
at
their
disposal
alike
in
counsel
and
in
action

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
as
representatives
of
the
people
in
the
legislative
branch
of
their
government
you
have
assembled
at
a
time
when
the
strength
and
excellence
of
our
free
institutions
and
the
fitness
of
our
citizens
to
enjoy
popular
rule
have
been
again
made
manifest
a
political
contest
involving
momentous
consequences
fraught
with
feverish
apprehension
and
creating
aggressiveness
so
intense
as
to
approach
bitterness
and
passion
has
been
waged
throughout
our
land
and
determined
by
the
decree
of
free
and
independent
suffrage
without
disturbance
of
our
tranquillity
or
the
least
sign
of
weakness
in
our
national
structure
when
we
consider
these
incidents
and
contemplate
the
peaceful
obedience
and
manly
submission
which
have
succeeded
a
heated
clash
of
political
opinions
we
discover
abundant
evidence
of
a
determination
on
the
part
of
our
countrymen
to
abide
by
every
verdict
of
the
popular
will
and
to
be
controlled
at
all
times
by
an
abiding
faith
in
the
agencies
established
for
the
direction
of
the
affairs
of
their
government
thus
our
people
exhibit
a
patriotic
disposition
which
entitles
them
to
demand
of
those
who
undertake
to
make
and
execute
their
laws
such
faithful
and
unselfish
service
in
their
behalf
as
can
only
be
prompted
by
a
serious
appreciation
of
the
trust
and
confidence
which
the
acceptance
of
public
duty
invites
in
obedience
to
a
constitutional
requirement
i
herein
submit
to
the
congress
certain
information
concerning
national
affairs
with
the
suggestion
of
such
legislation
as
in
my
judgment
is
necessary
and
expedient
to
secure
brevity
and
avoid
tiresome
narration
i
shall
omit
many
details
concerning
matters
within
federal
control
which
though
by
no
means
unimportant
are
more
profitably
discussed
in
departmental
reports
i
shall
also
further
curtail
this
communication
by
omitting
a
minute
recital
of
many
minor
incidents
connected
with
our
foreign
relations
which
have
heretofore
found
a
place
in
executive
messages
but
are
now
contained
in
a
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
which
is
herewith
submitted
at
the
outset
of
a
reference
to
the
more
important
matters
affecting
our
relations
with
foreign
powers
it
would
afford
me
satisfaction
if
i
could
assure
the
congress
that
the
disturbed
condition
in
asiatic
turkey
had
during
the
past
year
assumed
a
less
hideous
and
bloody
aspect
and
that
either
as
a
consequence
of
the
awakening
of
the
turkish
government
to
the
demands
of
humane
civilization
or
as
the
result
of
decisive
action
on
the
part
of
the
great
nations
having
the
right
by
treaty
to
interfere
for
the
protection
of
those
exposed
to
the
rage
of
mad
bigotry
and
cruel
fanaticism
the
shocking
features
of
the
situation
had
been
mitigated
instead
however
of
welcoming
a
softened
disposition
or
protective
intervention
we
have
been
afflicted
by
continued
and
not
unfrequent
reports
of
the
wanton
destruction
of
homes
and
the
bloody
butchery
of
men
women
and
children
made
martyrs
to
their
profession
of
christian
faith
while
none
of
our
citizens
in
turkey
have
thus
far
been
killed
or
wounded
though
often
in
the
midst
of
dreadful
scenes
of
danger
their
safety
in
the
future
is
by
no
means
assured
our
government
at
home
and
our
minister
at
constantinople
have
left
nothing
undone
to
protect
our
missionaries
in
ottoman
territory
who
constitute
nearly
all
the
individuals
residing
there
who
have
a
right
to
claim
our
protection
on
the
score
of
american
citizenship
our
efforts
in
this
direction
will
not
be
relaxed
but
the
deep
feeling
and
sympathy
that
have
been
aroused
among
our
people
ought
not
to
so
far
blind
their
reason
and
judgment
as
to
lead
them
to
demand
impossible
things
the
outbreaks
of
the
blind
fury
which
lead
to
murder
and
pillage
in
turkey
occur
suddenly
and
without
notice
and
an
attempt
on
our
part
to
force
such
a
hostile
presence
there
as
might
be
effective
for
prevention
or
protection
would
not
only
be
resisted
by
the
ottoman
government
but
would
be
regarded
as
an
interruption
of
their
plans
by
the
great
nations
who
assert
their
exclusive
right
to
intervene
in
their
own
time
and
method
for
the
security
of
life
and
property
in
turkey
several
naval
vessels
are
stationed
in
the
mediterranean
as
a
measure
of
caution
and
to
furnish
all
possible
relief
and
refuge
in
case
of
emergency
we
have
made
claims
against
the
turkish
government
for
the
pillage
and
destruction
of
missionary
property
at
harpoot
and
marash
during
uprisings
at
those
places
thus
far
the
validity
of
these
demands
has
not
been
admitted
though
our
minister
prior
to
such
outrages
and
in
anticipation
of
danger
demanded
protection
for
the
persons
and
property
of
our
missionary
citizens
in
the
localities
mentioned
and
notwithstanding
that
strong
evidence
exists
of
actual
complicity
of
turkish
soldiers
in
the
work
of
destruction
and
robbery
the
facts
as
they
now
appear
do
not
permit
us
to
doubt
the
justice
of
these
claims
and
nothing
will
be
omitted
to
bring
about
their
prompt
settlement
a
number
of
armenian
refugees
having
arrived
at
our
ports
an
order
has
lately
been
obtained
from
the
turkish
government
permitting
the
wives
and
children
of
such
refugees
to
join
them
here
it
is
hoped
that
hereafter
no
obstacle
will
be
interposed
to
prevent
the
escape
of
all
those
who
seek
to
avoid
the
perils
which
threaten
them
in
turkish
dominions
our
recently
appointed
consul
to
erzerum
is
at
his
post
and
discharging
the
duties
of
his
office
though
for
some
unaccountable
reason
his
formal
exequatur
from
the
sultan
has
not
been
issued
i
do
not
believe
that
the
present
somber
prospect
in
turkey
will
be
long
permitted
to
offend
the
sight
of
christendom
it
so
mars
the
humane
and
enlightened
civilization
that
belongs
to
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
it
seems
hardly
possible
that
the
earnest
demand
of
good
people
throughout
the
christian
world
for
its
corrective
treatment
will
remain
unanswered
the
insurrection
in
cuba
still
continues
with
all
its
perplexities
it
is
difficult
to
perceive
that
any
progress
has
thus
far
been
made
toward
the
pacification
of
the
island
or
that
the
situation
of
affairs
as
depicted
in
my
last
annual
message
has
in
the
least
improved
if
spain
still
holds
havana
and
the
seaports
and
all
the
considerable
towns
the
insurgents
still
roam
at
will
over
at
least
twothirds
of
the
inland
country
if
the
determination
of
spain
to
put
down
the
insurrection
seems
but
to
strengthen
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
is
evinced
by
her
unhesitating
devotion
of
largely
increased
military
and
naval
forces
to
the
task
there
is
much
reason
to
believe
that
the
insurgents
have
gained
in
point
of
numbers
and
character
and
resources
and
are
none
the
less
inflexible
in
their
resolve
not
to
succumb
without
practically
securing
the
great
objects
for
which
they
took
up
arms
if
spain
has
not
yet
reestablished
her
authority
neither
have
the
insurgents
yet
made
good
their
title
to
be
regarded
as
an
independent
state
indeed
as
the
contest
has
gone
on
the
pretense
that
civil
government
exists
on
the
island
except
so
far
as
spain
is
able
to
maintain
it
has
been
practically
abandoned
spain
does
keep
on
foot
such
a
government
more
or
less
imperfectly
in
the
large
towns
and
their
immediate
suburbs
but
that
exception
being
made
the
entire
country
is
either
given
over
to
anarchy
or
is
subject
to
the
military
occupation
of
one
or
the
other
party
it
is
reported
indeed
on
reliable
authority
that
at
the
demand
of
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
insurgent
army
the
putative
cuban
government
has
now
given
up
all
attempt
to
exercise
its
functions
leaving
that
government
confessedly
what
there
is
the
best
reason
for
supposing
it
always
to
have
been
in
fact
a
government
merely
on
paper
were
the
spanish
armies
able
to
meet
their
antagonists
in
the
open
or
in
pitched
battle
prompt
and
decisive
results
might
be
looked
for
and
the
immense
superiority
of
the
spanish
forces
in
numbers
discipline
and
equipment
could
hardly
fail
to
tell
greatly
to
their
advantage
but
they
are
called
upon
to
face
a
foe
that
shuns
general
engagements
that
can
choose
and
does
choose
its
own
ground
that
from
the
nature
of
the
country
is
visible
or
invisible
at
pleasure
and
that
fights
only
from
ambuscade
and
when
all
the
advantages
of
position
and
numbers
are
on
its
side
in
a
country
where
all
that
is
indispensable
to
life
in
the
way
of
food
clothing
and
shelter
is
so
easily
obtainable
especially
by
those
born
and
bred
on
the
soil
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
hardly
a
limit
to
the
time
during
which
hostilities
of
this
sort
may
be
prolonged
meanwhile
as
in
all
cases
of
protracted
civil
strife
the
passions
of
the
combatants
grow
more
and
more
inflamed
and
excesses
on
both
sides
become
more
frequent
and
more
deplorable
they
are
also
participated
in
by
bands
of
marauders
who
now
in
the
name
of
one
party
and
now
in
the
name
of
the
other
as
may
best
suit
the
occasion
harry
the
country
at
will
and
plunder
its
wretched
inhabitants
for
their
own
advantage
such
a
condition
of
things
would
inevitably
entail
immense
destruction
of
property
even
if
it
were
the
policy
of
both
parties
to
prevent
it
as
far
as
practicable
but
while
such
seemed
to
be
the
original
policy
of
the
spanish
government
it
has
now
apparently
abandoned
it
and
is
acting
upon
the
same
theory
as
the
insurgents
namely
that
the
exigencies
of
the
contest
require
the
wholesale
annihilation
of
property
that
it
may
not
prove
of
use
and
advantage
to
the
enemy
it
is
to
the
same
end
that
in
pursuance
of
general
orders
spanish
garrisons
are
now
being
withdrawn
from
plantations
and
the
rural
population
required
to
concentrate
itself
in
the
towns
the
sure
result
would
seem
to
be
that
the
industrial
value
of
the
island
is
fast
diminishing
and
that
unless
there
is
a
speedy
and
radical
change
in
existing
conditions
it
will
soon
disappear
altogether
that
value
consists
very
largely
of
course
in
its
capacity
to
produce
sugara
capacity
already
much
reduced
by
the
interruptions
to
tillage
which
have
taken
place
during
the
last
two
years
it
is
reliably
asserted
that
sh
ould
these
interruptions
continue
during
the
current
year
and
practically
extend
as
is
now
threatened
to
the
entire
sugarproducing
territory
of
the
island
so
much
time
and
so
much
money
will
be
required
to
restore
the
land
to
its
normal
productiveness
that
it
is
extremely
doubtful
if
capital
can
be
induced
to
even
make
the
attempt
the
spectacle
of
the
utter
ruin
of
an
adjoining
country
by
nature
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
charming
on
the
globe
would
engage
the
serious
attention
of
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
in
any
circumstances
in
point
of
fact
they
have
a
concern
with
it
which
is
by
no
means
of
a
wholly
sentimental
or
philanthropic
character
it
lies
so
near
to
us
as
to
be
hardly
separated
from
our
territory
our
actual
pecuniary
interest
in
it
is
second
only
to
that
of
the
people
and
government
of
spain
it
is
reasonably
estimated
that
at
least
from
to
of
american
capital
are
invested
in
plantations
and
in
railroad
mining
and
other
business
enterprises
on
the
island
the
volume
of
trade
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
which
in
amounted
to
about
rose
in
to
about
and
in
the
year
before
the
present
insurrection
broke
out
amounted
to
nearly
besides
this
large
pecuniary
stake
in
the
fortunes
of
cuba
the
united
states
finds
itself
inextricably
involved
in
the
present
contest
in
other
ways
both
vexatious
and
costly
many
cubans
reside
in
this
country
and
indirectly
promote
the
insurrection
through
the
press
by
public
meetings
by
the
purchase
and
shipment
of
arms
by
the
raising
of
funds
and
by
other
means
which
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
and
the
tenor
of
our
laws
do
not
permit
to
be
made
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecutions
some
of
them
though
cubans
at
heart
and
in
all
their
feelings
and
interests
have
taken
out
papers
as
naturalized
citizens
of
the
united
statesa
proceeding
resorted
to
with
a
view
to
possible
protection
by
this
government
and
not
unnaturally
regarded
with
much
indignation
by
the
country
of
their
origin
the
insurgents
are
undoubtedly
encouraged
and
supported
by
the
widespread
sympathy
the
people
of
this
country
always
and
instinctively
feel
for
every
struggle
for
better
and
freer
government
and
which
in
the
case
of
the
more
adventurous
and
restless
elements
of
our
population
leads
in
only
too
many
instances
to
active
and
personal
participation
in
the
contest
the
result
is
that
this
government
is
constantly
called
upon
to
protect
american
citizens
to
claim
damages
for
injuries
to
persons
and
property
now
estimated
at
many
millions
of
dollars
and
to
ask
explanations
and
apologies
for
the
acts
of
spanish
officials
whose
zeal
for
the
repression
of
rebellion
sometimes
blinds
them
to
the
immunities
belonging
to
the
unoffending
citizens
of
a
friendly
power
it
follows
from
the
same
causes
that
the
united
states
is
compelled
to
actively
police
a
long
line
of
seacoast
against
unlawful
expeditions
the
escape
of
which
the
utmost
vigilance
will
not
always
suffice
to
prevent
these
inevitable
entanglements
of
the
united
states
with
the
rebellion
in
cuba
the
large
american
property
interests
affected
and
considerations
of
philanthropy
and
humanity
in
general
have
led
to
a
vehement
demand
in
various
quarters
for
some
sort
of
positive
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
it
was
at
first
proposed
that
belligerent
rights
should
be
accorded
to
the
insurgentsa
proposition
no
longer
urged
because
untimely
and
in
practical
operation
dearly
perilous
and
injurious
to
our
own
interests
it
has
since
been
and
is
now
sometimes
contended
that
the
independence
of
the
insurgents
should
be
recognized
but
imperfect
and
restricted
as
the
spanish
government
of
the
island
may
be
no
other
exists
there
unless
the
will
of
the
military
officer
in
temporary
command
of
a
particular
district
can
be
dignified
as
a
species
of
government
it
is
now
also
suggested
that
the
united
states
should
buy
the
islanda
suggestion
possibly
worthy
of
consideration
if
there
were
any
evidence
of
a
desire
or
willingness
on
the
part
of
spain
to
entertain
such
a
proposal
it
is
urged
finally
that
all
other
methods
failing
the
existing
internecine
strife
in
cuba
should
be
terminated
by
our
intervention
even
at
the
cost
of
a
war
between
the
united
states
and
spaina
war
which
its
advocates
confidently
prophesy
could
neither
be
large
in
its
proportions
nor
doubtful
in
its
issue
the
correctness
of
this
forecast
need
be
neither
affirmed
nor
denied
the
united
states
has
nevertheless
a
character
to
maintain
as
a
nation
which
plainly
dictates
that
right
and
not
might
should
be
the
rule
of
its
conduct
further
though
the
united
states
is
not
a
nation
to
which
peace
is
a
necessity
it
is
in
truth
the
most
pacific
of
powers
and
desires
nothing
so
much
as
to
live
in
amity
with
all
the
world
its
own
ample
and
diversified
domains
satisfy
all
possible
longings
for
territory
preclude
all
dreams
of
conquest
and
prevent
any
casting
of
covetous
eyes
upon
neighboring
regions
however
attractive
that
our
conduct
toward
spain
and
her
dominions
has
constituted
no
exception
to
this
national
disposition
is
made
manifest
by
the
course
of
our
government
not
only
thus
far
during
the
present
insurrection
but
during
the
ten
years
that
followed
the
rising
at
yara
in
no
other
great
power
it
may
safely
be
said
under
circumstances
of
similar
perplexity
would
have
manifested
the
same
restraint
and
the
same
patient
endurance
it
may
also
be
said
that
this
persistent
attitude
of
the
united
states
toward
spain
in
connection
with
cuba
unquestionably
evinces
no
slight
respect
and
regard
for
spain
on
the
part
of
the
american
people
they
in
truth
do
not
forget
her
connection
with
the
discovery
of
the
western
hemisphere
nor
do
they
underestimate
the
great
qualities
of
the
spanish
people
nor
fail
to
fully
recognize
their
splendid
patriotism
and
their
chivalrous
devotion
to
the
national
honor
they
view
with
wonder
and
admiration
the
cheerful
resolution
with
which
vast
bodies
of
men
are
sent
across
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
and
an
enormous
debt
accumulated
that
the
costly
possession
of
the
gem
of
the
antilles
may
still
hold
its
place
in
the
spanish
crown
and
yet
neither
the
government
nor
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
shut
their
eyes
to
the
course
of
events
in
cuba
or
have
failed
to
realize
the
existence
of
conceded
grievances
which
have
led
to
the
present
revolt
from
the
authority
of
spaingrievances
recognized
by
the
queen
regent
and
by
the
cortes
voiced
by
the
most
patriotic
and
enlightened
of
spanish
statesmen
without
regard
to
party
and
demonstrated
by
reforms
proposed
by
the
executive
and
approved
by
the
legislative
branch
of
the
spanish
government
it
is
in
the
assumed
temper
and
disposition
of
the
spanish
government
to
remedy
these
grievances
fortified
by
indications
of
influential
public
opinion
in
spain
that
this
government
has
hoped
to
discover
the
most
promising
and
effective
means
of
composing
the
present
strife
with
honor
and
advantage
to
spain
and
with
the
achievement
of
all
the
reasonable
objects
of
the
insurrection
it
would
seem
that
if
spain
should
offer
to
cuba
genuine
autonomya
measure
of
home
rule
which
while
preserving
the
sovereignty
of
spain
would
satisfy
all
rational
requirements
of
her
spanish
subjectsthere
should
be
no
just
reason
why
the
pacification
of
the
island
might
not
be
effected
on
that
basis
such
a
result
would
appear
to
be
in
the
true
interest
of
all
concerned
it
would
at
once
stop
the
conflict
which
is
now
consuming
the
resources
of
the
island
and
making
it
worthless
for
whichever
party
may
ultimately
prevail
it
would
keep
intact
the
possessions
of
spain
without
touching
her
honor
which
will
be
consulted
rather
than
impugned
by
the
adequate
redress
of
admitted
grievances
it
would
put
the
prosperity
of
the
island
and
the
fortunes
of
its
inhabitants
within
their
own
control
without
severing
the
natural
and
ancient
ties
which
bind
them
to
the
mother
country
and
would
yet
enable
them
to
test
their
capacity
for
selfgovernment
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
it
has
been
objected
on
the
one
side
that
spain
should
not
promise
autonomy
until
her
insurgent
subjects
lay
down
their
arms
on
the
other
side
that
promised
autonomy
however
liberal
is
insufficient
because
without
assurance
of
the
promise
being
fulfilled
but
the
reasonableness
of
a
requirement
by
spain
of
unconditional
surrender
on
the
part
of
the
insurgent
cubans
before
their
autonomy
is
conceded
is
not
altogether
apparent
it
ignores
important
features
of
the
situationthe
stability
two
years
duration
has
given
to
the
insurrection
the
feasibility
of
its
indefinite
prolongation
in
the
nature
of
things
and
as
shown
by
past
experience
the
utter
and
imminent
ruin
of
the
island
unless
the
present
strife
is
speedily
composed
above
all
the
rank
abuses
which
all
parties
in
spain
all
branches
of
her
government
and
all
her
leading
public
men
concede
to
exist
and
profess
a
desire
to
remove
facing
such
circumstances
to
withhold
the
proffer
of
needed
reforms
until
the
parties
demanding
them
put
themselves
at
mercy
by
throwing
down
their
arms
has
the
appearance
of
neglecting
the
gravest
of
perils
and
inviting
suspicion
as
to
the
sincerity
of
any
professed
willingness
to
grant
reforms
the
objection
on
behalf
of
the
insurgents
that
promised
reforms
can
not
be
relied
upon
must
of
course
be
considered
though
we
have
no
right
to
assume
and
no
reason
for
assuming
that
anything
spain
undertakes
to
do
for
the
relief
of
cuba
will
not
be
done
according
to
both
the
spirit
and
the
letter
of
the
undertaking
nevertheless
realizing
that
suspicions
and
precautions
on
the
part
of
the
weaker
of
two
combatants
are
always
natural
and
not
always
unjustifiable
being
sincerely
desirous
in
the
interest
of
both
as
well
as
on
its
own
account
that
the
cuban
problem
should
be
solved
with
the
least
possible
delay
it
was
intimated
by
this
government
to
the
government
of
spain
some
months
ago
that
if
a
satisfactory
measure
of
home
rule
were
tendered
the
cuban
insurgents
and
would
be
accepted
by
them
upon
a
guaranty
of
its
executi
on
the
united
states
would
endeavor
to
find
a
way
not
objectionable
to
spain
of
furnishing
such
graranty
while
no
definite
response
to
this
intimation
has
yet
been
received
from
the
spanish
government
it
is
believed
to
be
not
altogether
unwelcome
while
as
already
suggested
no
reason
is
perceived
why
it
should
not
be
approved
by
the
insurgents
neither
party
can
fail
to
see
the
importance
of
early
action
and
both
must
realize
that
to
prolong
the
present
state
of
things
for
even
a
short
period
will
add
enormously
to
the
time
and
labor
and
expenditure
necessary
to
bring
about
the
industrial
recuperation
of
the
island
it
is
therefore
fervently
hoped
on
all
grounds
that
earnest
efforts
for
healing
the
breach
between
spain
and
the
insurgent
cubans
upon
the
lines
above
indicated
may
be
at
once
inaugurated
and
pushed
to
an
immediate
and
successful
issue
the
friendly
offices
of
the
united
states
either
in
the
manner
above
outlined
or
in
any
other
way
consistent
with
our
constitution
and
laws
will
always
be
at
the
disposal
of
either
party
whatever
circumstances
may
arise
our
policy
and
our
interests
would
constrain
us
to
object
to
the
acquisition
of
the
island
or
an
interference
with
its
control
by
any
other
power
it
should
be
added
that
it
can
not
be
reasonably
assumed
that
the
hitherto
expectant
attitude
of
the
united
states
will
be
indefinitely
maintained
while
we
are
anxious
to
accord
all
due
respect
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
we
can
not
view
the
pending
conflict
in
all
its
features
and
properly
apprehend
our
inevitably
close
relations
to
it
and
its
possible
results
without
considering
that
by
the
course
of
events
we
may
be
drawn
into
such
an
unusual
and
unprecedented
condition
as
will
fix
a
limit
to
our
patient
waiting
for
spain
to
end
the
contest
either
alone
and
in
her
own
way
or
with
our
friendly
cooperation
when
the
inability
of
spain
to
deal
successfully
with
the
insurrection
has
become
manifest
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
her
sovereignty
is
extinct
in
cuba
for
all
purposes
of
its
rightful
existence
and
when
a
hopeless
struggle
for
its
reestablishment
has
degenerated
into
a
strife
which
means
nothing
more
than
the
useless
sacrifice
of
human
life
and
the
utter
destruction
of
the
very
subjectmatter
of
the
conflict
a
situation
will
be
presented
in
which
our
obligations
to
the
sovereignty
of
spain
will
be
superseded
by
higher
obligations
which
we
can
hardly
hesitate
to
recognize
and
discharge
deferring
the
choice
of
ways
and
methods
until
the
time
for
action
arrives
we
should
make
them
depend
upon
the
precise
conditions
then
existing
and
they
should
not
be
determined
upon
without
giving
careful
heed
to
every
consideration
involving
our
honor
and
interest
or
the
international
duty
we
owe
to
spain
until
we
face
the
contingencies
suggested
or
the
situation
is
by
other
incidents
imperatively
changed
we
should
continue
in
the
line
of
conduct
heretofore
pursued
thus
in
all
circumstances
exhibiting
our
obedience
to
the
requirements
of
public
law
and
our
regard
for
the
duty
enjoined
upon
us
by
the
position
we
occupy
in
the
family
of
nations
a
contemplation
of
emergencies
that
may
arise
should
plainly
lead
us
to
avoid
their
creation
either
through
a
careless
disregard
of
present
duty
or
even
an
undue
stimulation
and
illtimed
expression
of
feeling
but
i
have
deemed
it
not
amiss
to
remind
the
congress
that
a
time
may
arrive
when
a
correct
policy
and
care
for
our
interests
as
well
as
a
regard
for
the
interests
of
other
nations
and
their
citizens
joined
by
considerations
of
humanity
and
a
desire
to
see
a
rich
and
fertile
country
intimately
related
to
us
saved
from
complete
devastation
will
constrain
our
government
to
such
action
as
will
subserve
the
interests
thus
involved
and
at
the
same
time
promise
to
cuba
and
its
inhabitants
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
peace
the
venezuelan
boundary
question
has
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
difference
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
their
respective
governments
having
agreed
upon
the
substantial
provisions
of
a
treaty
between
great
britain
and
venezuela
submitting
the
whole
controversy
to
arbitration
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
are
so
eminently
just
and
fair
that
the
assent
of
venezuela
thereto
may
confidently
be
anticipated
negotiations
for
a
treaty
of
general
arbitration
for
all
differences
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
are
far
advanced
and
promise
to
reach
a
successful
consummation
at
an
early
date
the
scheme
of
examining
applicants
for
certain
consular
positions
to
test
their
competency
and
fitness
adopted
under
an
executive
order
issued
on
the
th
of
september
has
fully
demonstrated
the
usefulness
of
this
innovation
in
connection
with
this
plan
of
examination
promotions
and
transfers
of
deserving
incumbents
have
been
quite
extensively
made
with
excellent
results
during
the
past
year
appointments
have
been
made
in
the
consular
service
of
which
were
made
to
fill
vacancies
caused
by
death
or
resignation
or
to
supply
newly
created
posts
to
succeed
incumbents
removed
for
cause
for
the
purpose
of
displacing
alien
consular
officials
by
american
citizens
and
merely
changing
the
official
title
of
incumbent
from
commercial
agent
to
consul
twelve
of
these
appointments
were
transfers
or
promotions
from
other
positions
under
the
department
of
state
of
those
appointed
had
rendered
previous
service
under
the
department
were
made
of
persons
who
passed
a
satisfactory
examination
were
appointed
to
places
not
included
in
the
order
of
september
and
appointments
as
above
stated
involved
no
change
of
incumbency
the
inspection
of
consular
offices
provided
for
by
an
appropriation
for
that
purpose
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
has
been
productive
of
such
wholesome
effects
that
i
hope
this
important
work
will
in
the
future
be
continued
i
know
of
nothing
that
can
be
done
with
the
same
slight
expense
so
improving
to
the
service
i
desire
to
repeat
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
in
favor
of
providing
at
public
expense
official
residences
for
our
ambassadors
and
ministers
at
foreign
capitals
the
reasons
supporting
this
recommendation
are
strongly
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
subject
seems
of
such
importance
that
i
hope
it
may
receive
the
early
attention
of
the
congress
we
have
during
the
last
year
labored
faithfully
and
against
unfavorable
conditions
to
secure
better
preservation
of
seal
life
in
the
bering
sea
both
the
united
states
and
great
britain
have
lately
dispatched
commissioners
to
these
waters
to
study
the
habits
and
condition
of
the
seal
herd
and
the
causes
of
their
rapid
decrease
upon
the
reports
of
these
commissioners
soon
to
be
submitted
and
with
the
exercise
of
patience
and
good
sense
on
the
part
of
all
interested
parties
it
is
earnestly
hoped
that
hearty
cooperation
may
be
secured
for
the
protection
against
threatened
extinction
of
seal
life
in
the
northern
pacific
and
bering
sea
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
reports
that
during
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
the
receipts
of
the
government
from
all
sources
amounted
to
during
the
same
period
its
expenditures
were
the
excess
of
expenditures
over
receipts
thus
amounting
to
the
ordinary
expenditures
during
the
year
were
less
than
during
the
preceding
fiscal
year
of
the
receipts
mentioned
there
was
derived
from
customs
the
sum
of
and
from
internal
revenue
the
receipts
from
customs
show
an
increase
of
over
those
from
the
same
source
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
and
the
receipts
from
internal
revenue
an
increase
of
the
value
of
our
imported
dutiable
merchandise
during
the
last
fiscal

of

an
increase

and
in
the
value
of
free

over
the
preceding
year
our
exports
of

foreign
and
domestic
amounted
in
value
to

an
increase
over
the

expense
of
the
steamship
companies
by
which
they
were
brought
in
the
increase
in
immigration
over
the
preceding
year
amounted
to
it
is
reported
that
with
some
exceptions
the
immigrants
of
the
past
year
were
of
a
hardy
laboring
class
accustomed
and
able
to
earn
a
support
for
themselves
and
it
is
estimated
that
the
money
brought
with
them
amounted
to
at
least
though
it
was
probably
much
in
excess
of
that
sum
since
only
those
having
less
than
are
required
to
disclose
the
exact
amount
and
it
is
known
that
many
brought
considerable
sums

there
arrived
from

during

it
is
the
opinion

the

authorities
that
the
apprehension
heretofore
existing
to
some
extent
of
a
large
immigration
from
japan
to
the
united
states
is
without
any
substantial
foundation
from
the
lifesaving
service
it
is
reported
that
the
number
of
disasters
to
documented
vessels
within
the
limits
of
its
operations
during
the

was
these

had
on

were

sixtyseven

were
besides
casualties

undocumented

there
were
persons
of

the
value
of
the
property

in
these
latter

is
estimated
at
of

the

during
the
year
also
rescued
or
assisted
numerous
other
vessels
and
warned
many
from
danger
by
signals
both
by
day
and
night
the
number
of
disasters
during
the
year
exceeded
that
of
any
previous
year
in
the
history
of
the
service
but
the
saving
of
both
life
and
property
was
greater
than
ever
before
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
the

involved

attached
to

department
together
with
various
recommendations
concerning
their
support
and
improvement
are
fully
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
which
the
attention
of
the
congress
is
especially
invited
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
exhibits
satisfactory
conditions
in
the
several
branches
of
the
public
service
intrusted
to
his
charge
the
limit
of
our
military
force
as
fixed
by
law
is
constantly
and
readily
maintained
the
present
discipline
and
morale
of
our
army
are
excellent
and
marked
progress
and
efficiency
are
apparent
throughout
its
entire
organization
with
the
exception
of
delicate
duties
in
the
suppression
of
slight
indian
disturbances
along
our
southwestern
boundary
in
which
the
mexican
troops
cooperated
and
the
compulsory
but
peaceful
return
with
the
consent
of
great
britain
of
a
band
of
cree
indians
from
montana
to
the
british
possessions
no
active
operations
have
been
required
of
the
army
during
the
year
past
changes
in
methods
of
administration
the
abandonment
of
unnecessary
posts
and
consequent
concentration
of
troops
and
the
exercise
of
care
and
vigilance
by
the
various
officers
charged
with
the
responsibility
in
the
expenditure
of
the
appropriations
have
resulted
in
reducing
to
a
minimum
the
cost
of
maintenance
of
our
military
establishment
during
the
past
year
the
work
of
constructing
permanent
infantry
and
cavalry
posts
has
been
continued
at
the
places
heretofore
designated
the
secretary
of
war
repeats
his
recommendation
that
appropriations
for
barracks
and
quarters
should
more
strictly
conform
to
the
needs
of
the
service
as
judged
by
the
department
rather
than
respond
to
the
wishes
and
importunities
of
localities
it
is
imperative
that
much
of
the
money
provided
for
such
construction
should
now
be
allotted
to
the
erection
of
necessary
quarters
for
the
garrisons
assigned
to
the
coast
defenses
where
many
men
will
be
needed
to
properly
care
for
and
operate
modern
guns
it
is
essential
too
that
early
provision
be
made
to
supply
the
necessary
force
of
artillery
to
meet
the
demands
of
this
service
the
entire
army
has
now
been
equipped
with
the
new
magazine
arms
and
wise
policy
demands
that
all
available
public
and
private
resources
should
be
so
employed
as
to
provide
within
a
reasonable
time
a
sufficient
number
to
supply
the
state
militia
with
these
modern
weapons
and
provide
an
ample
reserve
for
any
emergency
the
organized
militia
numbers
men
the
appropriations
for
its
support
by
the
several
states
approximate
annually
and
is
contributed
by
the
general
government
investigation
shows
these
troops
to
be
usually
well
drilled
and
inspired
with
much
military
interest
but
in
many
instances
they
are
so
deficient
in
proper
arms
and
equipment
that
a
sudden
call
to
active
duty
would
find
them
inadequately
prepared
for
field
service
i
therefore
recommend
that
prompt
measures
be
taken
to
remedy
this
condition
and
that
every
encouragement
be
given
to
this
deserving
body
of
unpaid
and
voluntary
citizen
soldiers
upon
whose
assistance
we
must
largely
rely
in
time
of
trouble
during
the
past
year
rapid
progress
has
been
made
toward
the
completion
of
the
scheme
adopted
for
the
erection
and
armament
of
fortifications
along
our
seacoast
while
equal
progress
has
been
made
in
providing
the
material
for
submarine
defense
in
connection
with
these
works
it
is
peculiarly
gratifying
at
this
time
to
note
the
great
advance
that
has
been
made
in
this
important
undertaking
since
the
date
of
my
annual
message
to
the
fiftythird
congress
at
the
opening
of
its
second
session
in
december
at
that
time
i
informed
the
congress
of
the
approaching
completion
of
nine
inch
twenty
inch
and
thirtyfour
inch
highpower
steel
guns
and
seventyfive
inch
rifled
mortars
this
total
then
seemed
insignificant
when
compared
with
the
great
work
remaining
to
be
done
yet
it
was
none
the
less
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
every
citizen
when
he
reflected
that
it
represented
the
first
installment
of
the
new
ordnance
of
american
design
and
american
manufacture
and
demonstrated
our
ability
to
supply
from
our
own
resources
guns
of
unexcelled
power
and
accuracy
at
that
date
however
there
were
practically
no
carriages
upon
which
to
mount
these
guns
and
only
thirtyone
emplacements
for
guns
and
sixtyfour
for
mortars
nor
were
all
these
emplacements
in
condition
to
receive
their
armament
only
one
highpower
gun
was
at
that
time
in
position
for
the
defense
of
the
entire
coast
since
that
time
the
number
of
guns
actually
completed
has
been
increased
to
a
total
of
twentyone
inch
fiftysix
inch
sixtyone
inch
highpower
breechloading
steel
guns
ten
rapidfire
guns
and
eighty
inch
rifled
mortars
in
addition
there
are
in
process
of
construction
one
inchtype
gun
fifty
inch
fiftysix
inch
twentyseven
inch
highpower
guns
and
sixtysix
inch
rifled
mortars
in
all
four
hundred
and
twentyeight
guns
and
mortars
during
the
same
year
immediately
preceding
the
message
referred
to
the
first
modern
gun
carriage
had
been
completed
and
eleven
more
were
in
process
of
construction
all
but
one
were
of
the
nondisappearing
type
these
however
were
not
such
as
to
secure
necessary
cover
for
the
artillery
gunners
against
the
intense
fire
of
modern
machine
rapidfire
and
highpower
guns
the
inventive
genius
of
ordnance
and
civilian
experts
has
been
taxed
in
designing
carriages
that
would
obviate
this
fault
resulting
it
is
believed
in
the
solution
of
this
difficult
problem
since
the
number
of
gun
carriages
constructed
or
building
has
been
raised
to
a
total
of
of
which
are
on
the
disappearing
principle
and
the
number
of
mortar
carriages
to
while
the
emplacements
which
were
provided
for
prior
to
that
time
have
been
increased
to
built
and
building
this
improved
situation
is
largely
due
to
the
recent
generous
response
of
congress
to
the
recommendations
of
the
war
department
thus
we
shall
soon
have
complete
about
onefifth
of
the
com
prehensive
system
the
first
step
in
which
was
noted
in
my
message
to
the
congress
of
december
when
it
is
understood
that
a
masonry
emplacement
not
only
furnishes
a
platform
for
the
heavy
modern
highpower
gun
but
also
in
every
particular
serves
the
purpose
and
takes
the
place
of
the
fort
of
former
days
the
importance
of
the
work
accomplished
is
better
comprehended
in
the
hope
that
the
work
will
be
prosecuted
with
no
less
vigor
in
the
future
the
secretary
of
war
has
submitted
an
estimate
by
which
if
allowed
there
will
be
provided
and
either
built
or
building
by
the
end
of
the
next
fiscal
year
such
additional
guns
mortars
gun
carriages
and
emplacements
as
will
represent
not
far
from
onethird
of
the
total
work
to
be
done
under
the
plan
adopted
for
our
coast
defenses
thus
affording
a
prospect
that
the
entire
work
will
be
substantially
completed
within
six
years
in
less
time
than
that
however
we
shall
have
attained
a
marked
degree
of
security
the
experience
and
results
of
the
past
year
demonstrate
that
with
a
continuation
of
present
careful
methods
the
cost
of
the
remaining
work
will
be
much
less
than
the
original
estimate
we
should
always
keep
in
mind
that
of
all
forms
of
military
preparation
coast
defense
alone
is
essentially
pacific
in
its
nature
while
it
gives
the
sense
of
security
due
to
a
consciousness
of
strength
it
is
neither
the
purpose
nor
the
effect
of
such
permanent
fortifications
to
involve
us
in
foreign
complications
but
rather
to
guarantee
us
against
them
they
are
not
temptation
to
war
but
security
against
it
thus
they
are
thoroughly
in
accord
with
all
the
traditions
of
our
national
diplomacy
the
attorneygeneral
presents
a
detailed
and
interesting
statement
of
the
important
work
done
under
his
supervision
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
ownership
and
management
by
the
government
of
penitentiaries
for
the
confinement
of
those
convicted
in
united
states
courts
of
violations
of
federal
laws
which
for
many
years
has
been
a
subject
of
executive
recommendation
have
at
last
to
a
slight
extent
been
realized
by
the
utilization
of
the
abandoned
military
prison
at
fort
leavenworth
as
a
united
states
penitentiary
this
is
certainly
a
movement
in
the
right
direction
but
it
ought
to
be
at
once
supplemented
by
the
rebuilding
or
extensive
enlargement
of
this
improvised
prison
and
the
construction
of
at
least
one
more
to
be
located
in
the
southern
states
the
capacity
of
the
leavenworth
penitentiary
is
so
limited
that
the
expense
of
its
maintenance
calculated
at
a
per
capita
rate
upon
the
number
of
prisoners
it
can
accommodate
does
not
make
as
economical
an
exhibit
as
it
would
if
it
were
larger
and
better
adapted
to
prison
purposes
but
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
economy
humanity
and
a
proper
sense
of
responsibility
and
duty
toward
those
whom
we
punish
for
violations
of
federal
law
dictate
that
the
federal
government
should
have
the
entire
control
and
management
of
the
penitentiaries
where
convicted
violators
are
confined
it
appears
that
since
the
transfer
of
the
fort
leavenworth
military
prison
to
its
new
uses
the
work
previously
done
by
prisoners
confined
there
and
for
which
expensive
machinery
has
been
provided
has
been
discontinued
this
work
consisted
of
the
manufacture
of
articles
for
army
use
now
done
elsewhere
on
all
grounds
it
is
exceedingly
desirable
that
the
convicts
confined
in
this
penitentiary
be
allowed
to
resume
work
of
this
description
it
is
most
gratifying
to
note
the
satisfactory
results
that
have
followed
the
inauguration
of
the
new
system
provided
for
by
the
act
of
may
under
which
certain
federal
officials
are
compensated
by
salaries
instead
of
fees
the
new
plan
was
put
in
operation
on
the
st
day
of
july
and
already
the
great
economy
it
enforces
its
prevention
of
abuses
and
its
tendency
to
a
better
enforcement
of
the
laws
are
strikingly
apparent
detailed
evidence
of
the
usefulness
of
this
longdelayed
but
now
happily
accomplished
reform
will
be
found
clearly
set
forth
in
the
attorneygenerals
report
our
postoffice
department
is
in
good
condition
and
the
exhibit
made
of
its
operations
during
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
if
allowance
is
made
for
imperfections
in
the
laws
applicable
to
it
is
very
satisfactory
the
total
receipts
during
the
year
were
the
total
expenditures
were
exclusive
of
the
which
was
earned
by
the
pacific
railroad
for
transportation
and
credited
on
their
debt
to
the
government
there
was
an
increase
of
receipts
over
the
previous
year
of
or
per
cent
and
an
increase
of
expenditures
of
or
per
cent
the
deficit
was
less
than
that
of
the
preceding
year
the
chief
expenditures
of
the
postal
service
are
regulated
by
law
and
are
not
in
the
control
of
the
postmastergeneral
all
that
he
can
accomplish
by
the
most
watchful
administration
and
economy
is
to
enforce
prompt
and
thorough
collection
and
accounting
for
public
moneys
and
such
minor
savings
in
small
expenditures
and
in
letting
those
contracts
for
postoffice
supplies
and
star
service
which
are
not
regulated
by
statute
an
effective
cooperation
between
the
auditors
office
and
the
postoffice
department
and
the
making
and
enforcement
of
orders
by
the
department
requiring
immediate
notification
to
their
sureties
of
all
delinquencies
on
the
part
of
postmasters
and
compelling
such
postmasters
to
make
more
frequent
deposits
of
postal
funds
have
resulted
in
a
prompter
auditing
of
their
accounts
and
much
less
default
to
the
government
than
heretofore
the
years
report
shows
large
extensions
of
both
starroute
service
and
railway
mail
service
with
increased
postal
facilities
much
higher
accuracy
in
handling
mails
has
also
been
reached
as
appears
by
the
decrease
of
errors
in
the
railway
mail
service
and
the
reduction
of
mail
matter
returned
to
the
deadletter
office
the
deficit
for
the
last
year
although
much
less
than
that
of
the
last
and
preceding
years
emphasizes
the
necessity
for
legislation
to
correct
the
growing
abuse
of
secondclass
rates
to
which
the
deficiency
is
mainly
attributable
the
transmission
at
the
rate
of
cent
a
pound
of
serial
libraries
advertising
sheets
house
organs
periodicals
advertising
some
particular
house
or
institution
sample
copies
and
the
like
ought
certainly
to
be
discontinued
a
glance
at
the
revenues
received
for
the
work
done
last
year
will
show
more
plainly
than
any
other
statement
the
gross
abuse
of
the
postal
service
and
the
growing
waste
of
its
earnings
the
free
matter
carried
in
the
mails
for
the
departments
offices
etc
of
the
government
and
for
congress
in
pounds
amounted
to
if
this
is
offset
against
buildings
for
postoffices
and
stations
the
rental
of
which
would
more
than
compensate
for
such
free
postal
service
we
have
this
exhibit

of
mail
matter

above

the

the
remainder
of
our
postal
revenue
amounting
to
something
more
than
was
derived
from
box

moneyorder
business
and
other
similar
items
the
entire
expenditures
of
the
department
including
pay
for
transportation
credited
to
the
pacific
railroads
were
which
may
be
considered
as
the
cost
of
receiving
carrying
and
delivering
the
above
mail
matter
it
thus
appears
that
though
the
secondclass
matter
constituted
more
than
twothirds
of
the
total
that
was
carried
the
revenue
derived
from
it
was
less
than
onethirtieth
of
the
total
expense
the
average
revenue
was
from
each
pound
of
firstclass
matter

from
each
pound
of
second

from
each
pound
of
third
class
cents
from
each
pound
of

of
the
second
class
was
countyfree
matter
the
growth
in
weight
of
secondclass
matter
has
been
from
pounds
in
to
in
and
to
almost
in
and
it
is
quite
evident
this
increasing
drawback
is
far
outstripping
any
possible
growth
of
postal
revenues
our
mail
service
should
of
course
be
such
as
to
meet
the
wants
and
even
the
conveniences
of
our
people
at
a
direct
charge
upon
them
so
light
as
perhaps
to
exclude
the
idea
of
our
postoffice
department
being
a
moneymaking
concern
but
in
the
face
of
a
constantly
recurring
deficiency
in
its
revenues
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
supply
the
best
mail
service
in
the
world
it
seems
to
me
it
is
quite
time
to
correct
the
abuses
that
swell
enormously
our
annual
deficit
if
we
concede
the
public
policy
of
carrying
weekly
newspapers
free
in
the
county
of
publication
and
even
the
policy
of
carrying
at
less
than
onetenth
of
their
cost
other
bona
fide
newspapers
and
periodicals
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
subjecting
the
service
to
the
further
immense
and
increasing
loss
involved
in
carrying
at
the
nominal
rate
of
cent
a
pound
the
serial
libraries
sometimes
including
trashy
and
even
harmful
literature
and
other
matter
which
under
the
loose
interpretation
of
a
loose
statute
have
been
gradually
given
secondclass
rates
thus
absorbing
all
profitable
returns
derived
from
firstclass
matter
which
pays
three
or
four
times
more
than
its
cost
and
producing
a
large
annual
loss
to
be
paid
by
general
taxation
if
such
secondclass
matter
paid
merely
the
cost
of
its
handling
our
deficit
would
disappear
and
a
surplus
result
which
might
be
used
to
give
the
people
still
better
mail
facilities
or
cheaper
rates
of
letter
postage
i
recommend
that
legislation
be
at
once
enacted
to
correct
these
abuses
and
introduce
better
business
ideas
in
the
regulation
of
our
postal
rates
experience
and
observation
have
demonstrated
that
certain
improvements
in
the
organization
of
the
postoffice
department
must
be
secured
before
we
can
gain
the
full
benefit
of
the
immense
sums
expended
in
its
administration
this
involves
the
following
reforms
which
i
earnestly
recommend
there
should
be
a
small
addition
to
the
existing
inspector
service
to
be
employed
in
the
supervision
of
the
carrier
force
which
now
numbers
men
and
performs
its
service
practically
without
the
surveillance
exercised
over
all
other
branches
of
the
postal
o
r
public
service
of
course
such
a
lack
of
supervision
and
freedom
from
wholesome
disciplinary
restraints
must
inevitably
lead
to
imperfect
service
there
should
also
be
appointed
a
few
inspectors
who
could
assist
the
central
office
in
necessary
investigation
concerning
matters
of
postoffice
leases
postoffice
sites
allowances
for
rent
fuel
and
lights
and
in
organizing
and
securing
the
best
results
from
the
work
of
the
clerks
now
employed
in
first
and
second
class
offices
i
am
convinced
that
the
small
expense
attending
the
inauguration
of
these
reforms
would
actually
be
a
profitable
investment
i
especially
recommend
such
a
recasting
of
the
appropriations
by
congress
for
the
postoffice
department
as
will
permit
the
postmastergeneral
to
proceed
with
the
work
of
consolidating
postoffices
this
work
has
already
been
entered
upon
sufficiently
to
fully
demonstrate
by
experiment
and
experience
that
such
consolidation
is
productive
of
better
service
larger
revenues
and
less
expenditures
to
say
nothing
of
the
further
advantage
of
gradually
withdrawing
postoffices
from
the
spoils
system
the
universal
postal
union
which
now
embraces
all
the
civilized
world
and
whose
delegates
will
represent
people
will
hold
its
fifth
congress
in
the
city
of
washington
in
may
the
united
states
may
be
said
to
have
taken
the
initiative
which
led
to
the
first
meeting
of
this
congress
at
berne
in
and
the
formation
of
the
universal
postal
union
which
brings
the
postal
service
of
all
countries
to
every
mans
neighborhood
and
has
wrought
marvels
in
cheapening
postal
rates
and
securing
absolutely
safe
mail
communication
throughout
the
world
previous
congresses
have
met
in
berne
paris
lisbon
and
vienna
and
the
respective
countries
in
which
they
have
assembled
have
made
generous
provision
for
their
accommodation
and
for
the
reception
and
entertainment
of
the
delegates
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this
assemblage
and
of
its
deliberations
and
of
the
honors
and
hospitalities
accorded
to
our
representatives
by
other
countries
on
similar
occasions
i
earnestly
hope
that
such
an
appropriation
will
be
made
for
the
expenses
necessarily
attendant
upon
the
coming
meeting
in
our
capital
city
as
will
be
worthy
of
our
national
hospitality
and
indicative
of
our
appreciation
of
the
event
the
work
of
the
navy
department
and
its
present
condition
are
fully
exhibited
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
the
construction
of
vessels
for
our
new
navy
has
been
energetically
prosecuted
by
the
present
administration
upon
the
general
lines
previously
adopted
the
department
having
seen
no
necessity
for
radical
changes
in
prior
methods
under
which
the
work
was
found
to
be
progressing
in
a
manner
highly
satisfactory
it
has
been
decided
however
to
provide
in
every
shipbuilding
contract
that
the
builder
should
pay
all
trial
expenses
and
it
has
also
been
determined
to
pay
no
speed
premiums
in
future
contracts
the
premiums
recently
earned
and
some
yet
to
be
decided
are
features
of
the
contracts
made
before
this
conclusion
was
reached
on
march
there
were
in
commission
but
two
armored

also
been
commissioned
the

another
battle
ship
will
be
completed
about
march
and
at
least
more
gunboats
will
be
ready
for
sea
in
the
early
spring
it
is
gratifying
to
state
that
our
ships
and
their
outfits
are
believed
to
be
equal
to
the
best
that
can
be
manufactured
elsewhere
and
that
such
notable
reductions
have
been
made
in
their
cost
as
to
justify
the
statement
that
quite
a
number
of
vessels
are
now
being
constructed
at
rates
as
low
as
those
that
prevail
in
european
shipyards
our

the
secretary
expresses
the
opinion
that
we
have
for
the
present
a
sufficient
supply
of
cruisers
and
gunboats
and
that
hereafter
the
construction
of
battle
ships
and
torpedo
boats
will
supply
our
needs
much
attention
has
been
given
to
the
methods
of
carrying
on
departmental
business
important
modifications
in
the
regulations
have
been
made
tending
to
unify
the
control
of
shipbuilding
as
far
as
may
be
under
the
bureau
of
construction
and
repair
and
also
to
improve
the
mode
of
purchasing
supplies
for
the
navy
by
the
bureau
of
supplies
and
accounts
the
establishment
under
recent
acts
of
congress
of
a
supply
fund
with
which
to
purchase
these
supplies
in
large
quantities
and
other
modifications
of
methods
have
tended
materially
to
their
cheapening
and
better
quality
the
war
college
has
developed
into
an
institution
which
it
is
believed
will
be
of
great
value
to
the
navy
in
teaching
the
science
of
war
as
well
as
in
stimulating
professional
zeal
in
the
navy
and
it
will
be
especially
useful
in
the
devising
of
plans
for
the
utilization
in
case
of
necessity
of
all
the
naval
resources
of
the
united
states
the
secretary
has
persistently
adhered
to
the
plan
he
found
in
operation
for
securing
labor
at
navyyards
through
boards
of
labor
employment
and
has
done
much
to
make
it
more
complete
and
efficient
the
naval
officers
who
are
familiar
with
this
system
and
its
operation
express
the
decided
opinion
that
its
results
have
been
to
vastly
improve
the
character
of
the
work
done
at
our
yards
and
greatly
reduce
its
cost
discipline
among
the
officers
and
men
of
the
navy
has
been
maintained
to
a
high
standard
and
the
percentage
of
american
citizens
enlisted
has
been
very
much
increased
the
secretary
is
considering
and
will
formulate
during
the
coming
winter
a
plan
for
laying
up
ships
in
reserve
thereby
largely
reducing
the
cost
of
maintaining
our
vessels
afloat
this
plan
contemplates
that
battle
ships
torpedo
boats
and
such
of
the
cruisers
as
are
not
needed
for
active
service
at
sea
shall
be
kept
in
reserve
with
skeleton
crews
on
board
to
keep
them
in
condition
cruising
only
enough
to
insure
the
efficiency
of
the
ships
and
their
crews
in
time
of
activity
the
economy
to
result
from
this
system
is
too
obvious
to
need
comment
the
naval
militia
which
was
authorized
a
few
years
ago
as
an
experiment
has
now
developed
into
a
body
of
enterprising
young
men
active
and
energetic
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
and
promising
great
usefulness
this
establishment
has
nearly
the
same
relation
to
our
navy
as
the
national
guard
in
the
different
states
bears
to
our
army
and
it
constitutes
a
source
of
supply
for
our
naval
forces
the
importance
of
which
is
immediately
apparent
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
presents
a
comprehensive
and
interesting
exhibit
of
the
numerous
and
important
affairs
committed
to
his
supervision
it
is
impossible
in
this
communication
to
do
more
than
briefly
refer
to
a
few
of
the
subjects
concerning
which
the
secretary
gives
full
and
instructive
information
the
money
appropriated
on
account
of
this
department
and
for
its
disbursement
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
amounted
to
more
than
or
a
greater
sum
than
was
appropriated
for
the
entire
maintenance
of
the
government
for
the
two
fiscal
years
ended
june
our
public
lands
originally
amounting
to
acres
have
been
so
reduced
that
only
about
acres
still
remain
in
government
control
excluding
alaska
the
balance
being
by
far
the
most
valuable
portion
has
been
given
away
to
settlers
to
new
states
and
to
railroads
or
sold
at
a
comparatively
nominal
sum
the
patenting
of
land
in
execution
of
railroad
grants
has
progressed
rapidly
during
the
year
and
since
the
th
day
of
march
about
acres
have
thus
been
conveyed
to
these
corporations
i
agree
with
the
secretary
that
the
remainder
of
our
public
lands
should
be
more
carefully
dealt
with
and
their
alienation
guarded
by
better
economy
and
greater
prudence
the
commission
appointed
from
the
membership
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
provided
for
by
an
act
of
congress
to
formulate
plans
for
a
national
forestry
system
will
it
is
hoped
soon
be
prepared
to
present
the
result
of
thorough
and
intelligent
examination
of
this
important
subject
the
total
indian
population
of
the
united
states
is
according
to
a
census
made
in
exclusive
of
those
within
the
state
of
new
york
and
those
comprising
the
five
civilized
tribes
of
this
number
there
are
approximately
children
of
school
age
during
the
year
of
these
were
enrolled
in
schools
the
progress
which
has
attended
recent
efforts
to
extend
indianschool
facilities
and
the
anticipation
of
continued
liberal
appropriations
to
that
end
can
not
fail
to
afford
the
utmost
satisfaction
to
those
who
believe
that
the
education
of
indian
children
is
a
prime
factor
in
the
accomplishment
of
indian
civilization
it
may
be
said
in
general
terms
that
in
every
particular
the
improvement
of
the
indians
under
government
care
has
been
most
marked
and
encouraging
the
secretary
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
the
agents
having
charge
of
indians

to
whom
allotments
have
been
made
strongly
urge
the
passage
of
a
law
prohibiting
the
sale
of
liquor
to
allottees
who
have
taken
their
lands
in
severalty
i
earnestly
join
in
this
recommendation
and
venture
to
express
the
hope
that
the
indian
may
be
speedily
protected
against
this
greatest
of
all
obstacles
to
his
wellbeing
and
advancement
the
condition
of
affairs
among
the
five
civilized
tribes
who
occupy
large
tracts
of
land
in
the
indian
territory
and
who
have
governments
of
their
own
has
assumed
such
an
aspect
as
to
render
it
almost
indispensable
that
there
should
be
an
entire
change
in
the
relations
of
these
indians
to
the
general
government
this
seems
to
be
necessary
in
furtherance
of
their
own
interests
as
well
as
for
the
protection
of
nonindian
residents
in
their
territory
a
commission
organized
and
empowered
under
several
recent
laws
is
now
negotiating
with
these
indians
for
the
relinquishment
of
their
courts
and
the
division
of
their
common
lands
in
severalty
and
are
aiding
in
the
settlement
of
the
troublesome
question
of
tribal
membership
the
reception
of
their
first
proffers
of
negotiation
was
not
encouraging
but
through
patience
and
such
conduct
on
their
part
as
demonstrated
that
their
intentions
were
friendly
and
in
the
interest
of
the
tribes
the
prospect
of
success
has
become
more
promising
the
effort
should
be
to
save
these
indians
from
the
consequences
of
their
own
mistakes
and
improvidence
and
to
secure
to
the
real
indian
his
rights
as
against
intruders
and
professed
friends
who
profit
by
his
retrogression
a
change
is
also
needed
to
protect
life
and
property
through
the
operation
of
courts
conducted
according
to
strict
justice
and
strong
enough
to
enforce
their
mandates
as
a
sincere
friend
of
the
indian
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
that
these
reforms
should
be
accomplished
with
the
consent
and
aid
of
the
tribes
and
that
no
necessity
may
be
presented
for
radical
or
drastic
legislation
i
hope
therefore
that
the
commission
now
conducting
negotiations
will
soon
be
able
to
report
that
progress
has
been
made
toward
a
friendly
adjustment
of
existing
difficulties
it
appears
that
a
very
valuable
deposit
of
gilsonite
or
asphaltum
has
been
found
on
the
reservation
in
utah
occupied
by
the
uncompahgre
ute
indians
every
consideration
of
care
for
the
public
interest
and
every
sensible
business
reason
dictate
such
management
or
disposal
of
this
important
source
of
public
revenue
as
will
except
it
from
the
general
rules
and
incidents
attending
the
ordinary
disposition
of
public
lands
and
secure
to
the
government
a
fair
share
at
least
of
its
advantages
in
place
of
its
transfer
for
a
nominal
sum
to
interested
individuals
i
indorse
the
recommendation
made
by
the
present
secretary
of
the
interior
as
well
as
his
predecessor
that
a
permanent
commission
consisting
of
three
members
one
of
whom
shall
be
an
army
officer
be
created
to
perform
the
duties
now
devolving
upon
the
commissioner
and
assistant
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
the
management
of
the
bureau
involves
such
numerous
and
diverse
details
and
the
advantages
of
an
uninterrupted
policy
are
so
apparent
that
i
hope
the
change
suggested
will
meet
the
approval
of
the
congress
the
diminution
of
our
enormous
pension
roll
and
the
decrease
of
pension
expenditure
which
have
been
so
often
confidently
for
told
still
fail
in
material
realization
the
number
of
pensioners
on
the
polls
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
was
this
is
the
largest
number
ever
reported
the
amount
paid
exclusively
for
pensions
during
the
year
was
a
slight
decrease
from
that
of
the
preceding
year
while
the
total
expenditures
on
account
of
pensions
including
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
department
and
expenses
attending
pension
distribution
amounted
to
or
within
every
small
fraction
of
onethird
of
the
entire
expense
of
supporting
the
government
during
the
same
year
the
number
of
new
pension
certificates
issued
was
of
these
represent
original
allowances
of
claims
and
increases
of
existing
pensions
the
number
of
persons
receiving
pensions
from
the
united
states
but
residing
in
foreign
countries
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
was
and
the
amount
paid
to
them
during
the
year
was
the
sum
appropriated
for
the
payment
of
pensions
for
the
current
fiscal
year
ending
june
is
and
for
the
succeeding
year
it
is
estimated
that
the
same
amount
will
be
necessary
the
commissioner
of
pensions
reports
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
indictments
were
found
against
violators
of
the
pension
laws
upon
these
indictments
convictions
resulted
in
my
opinion
based
upon
such
statements
as
these
and
much
other
information
and
observation
the
abuses
which
have
been
allowed
to
creep
into
our
pension
system
have
done
incalculable
harm
in
demoralizing
our
people
and
undermining
good
citizenship
i
have
endeavored
within
my
sphere
of
official
duty
to
protect
our
pension
roll
and
make
it
what
it
should
be
a
roll
of
honor
containing
the
names
of
those
disabled
in
their
countrys
service
and
worthy
of
their
countrys
affectionate
remembrance
when
i
have
seen
those
who
pose
as
the
soldiers
friends
active
and
alert
in
urging
greater
laxity
and
more
reckless
pension
expenditure
while
nursing
selfish
schemes
i
have
deprecated
the
approach
of
a
situation
when
necessary
retrenchment
and
enforced
economy
may
lead
to
an
attack
upon
pension
abuses
so
determined
as
to
overlook
the
discrimination
due
to
those
who
worthy
of
a
nations
care
ought
to
live
and
die
under
the
protection
of
a
nations
gratitude
the
secretary
calls
attention
to
the
public
interests
involved
in
an
adjustment
of
the
obligations
of
the
pacific
railroads
to
the
government
i
deem
it
to
be
an
important
duty
to
especially
present
this
subject
to
the
consideration
of
the
congress
on
january
with
the
amount
already
matured
more
than
of
the
principal
of
the
subsidy
bonds
issued
by
the
united
states
in
aid
of
the
construction
of
the
union
pacific
railway
including
its
kansas
line
and
more
than
of
like
bonds
issued
in
aid
of
the
central
pacific
railroad
including
those
issued
to
the
western
pacific
railroad
company
will
have
fallen
due
and
been
paid
or
must
on
that
day
be
paid
by
the
government
without
any
reference
to
the
application
of
the
sinking
fund
now
in
the
treasury
this
will
create
such
a
default
on
the
part
of
these
companies
to
the
government
as
will
give
it
the
right
to
at
once
institute
proceedings
to
foreclose
its
mortgage
lien
in
addition
to
this
indebtedness
which
will
be
due
january
there
will
mature
between
that
date
and
january
the
remaining
principal
of
such
subsidy
bonds
which
must
also
be
met
by
the
government
these
amount
to
more
than
on
account
of
the
union
pacific
lines
and
exceed
on
account
of
the
central
pacific
lines
the
situation
of
these
roads
and
the
condition
of
their
indebtedness
to
the
government
have
been
fully
set
forth
in
the
reports
of
various
committees
to
the
present
and
prior
congresses
and
as
early
as
they
were
thoroughly
examined
by
a
special
commission
appointed
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
the
considerations
requiring
an
adjustment
of
the
governments
relations
to
the
companies
have
been
clearly
presented
and
the
conclusion
reached
with
practical
uniformity
that
if
these
relations
are
not
terminated
they
should
be
revised
upon
a
basis
securing
their
safe
continuance
under
section
of
the
act
of
congress
passed
march
the
president
is
charged
with
the
duty
in
the
event
that
any
mortgage
or
other
incumbrance
paramount
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
property
of
the
pacific
railroads
should
exist
and
be
lawfully
liable
to
be
enforced
to
direct
the
action
of
the
departments
of
treasury
and
of
justice
in
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
united
states
by
redemption
or
through
judicial
proceedings
including
foreclosures
of
the
government
liens
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
for
a
number
of
years
almost
constantly
had
under
consideration
various
plans
for
dealing
with
the
conditions
existing
between
these
roads
and
the
government
i
have
thus
far
felt
justified
in
withholding
action
under
the
statute
above
mentioned
in
the
case
of
the
union
pacific
company
however
the
situation
has
become
especially
and
immediately
urgent
proceedings
have
been
instituted
to
foreclose
a
first
mortgage
upon
those
aided
parts
of
the
main
lines
upon
which
the
government
holds
a
second
and
subordinate
mortgage
lien
in
consequence
of
those
proceedings
and
increasing
complications
added
to
the
default
occurring
on
the
st
day
of
january
a
condition
will
be
presented
at
that
date
so
far
as
this
company
is
concerned
that
must
emphasize
the
mandate
of
the
act
of
and
give
to
executive
duty
under
its
provisions
a
more
imperative
aspect
therefore
unless
congress
shall
otherwise
direct
or
shall
have
previously
determined
upon
a
different
solution
of
the
problem
there
will
hardly
appear
to
exist
any
reason
for
delaying
beyond
the
date
of
the
default
above
mentioned
such
executive
action
as
will
promise
to
subserve
the
public
interests
and
save
the
government
from
the
loss
threatened
by
further
inaction
the
department
of
agriculture
is
so
intimately
related
to
the
welfare
of
our
people
and
the
prosperity
of
our
nation
that
it
should
constantly
receive
the
care
and
encouragement
of
the
government
from
small
beginnings
it
has
grown
to
be
the
center
of
agricultural
intelligence
and
the
source
of
aid
and
encouragement
to
agricultural
efforts
large
sums
of
money
are
annually
appropriated
for
the
maintenance
of
this
department
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
legislation
relating
to
it
has
not
always
been
directly
in
the
interest
of
practical
farming
or
properly
guarded
against
waste
and
extravagance
so
far
however
as
public
money
has
been
appropriated
fairly
and
sensibly
to
help
those
who
actually
till
the
soil
no
expenditure
has
been
more
profitably
made
or
more
generally
approved
by
the
people
under
the
present
management
of
the
department
its
usefulness
has
been
enhanced
in
every
direction
and
at
the
same
time
strict
economy
has
been
enforced
to
the

utmost
extent
permitted
by
congressional
action
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
it
appears
that
through
careful
and
prudent
financial
management
he
has
annually
saved
a
large
sum
from
his
appropriations
aggregating
during
his
incumbency
and
up
to
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
nearly
onefifth
of
the
entire
amount
appropriated
these
results
have
been
accomplished
by
a
conscientious
study
of
the
real
needs
of
the
farmer
and
such
a
regard
for
economy
as
the
genuine
farmer
ought
to
appreciate
supplemented
by
a
rigid
adherence
to
civilservice
methods
in
a
department
which
should
be
conducted
in
the
interest
of
agriculture
instead
of
partisan
politics
the
secretary
reports
that
the
value
of
our
exports
of
farm
products
during
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
an
increase
of
over
those
of
the
year
immediately
preceding
this
statement
is
not
the
less
welcome
because
of
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
such
increase
the
proportion
of
exported
agricultural
products
to
our
total
exports
of
all
descriptions
fell
off
during
the
year
the
benefits
of
an
increase
in
agricultural
exports
being
assured
the
decrease
in
its
proportion
to
our
total
exports
is
the
more
gratifying
when
we
consider
that
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
such
total
exports
for
the
year
increased
more
than
the
large
and
increasing
exportation
of
our
agricultural
products
suggests
the
great
usefulness
of
the
organization
lately
established
in
the
department
for
the
purpose
of
giving
to
those
engaged
in
farming
pursuits
reliable
information
concerning
the
condition
needs
and
advantages
of
different
foreign
markets
inasmuch
as
the
success
of
the
farmer
depends
upon
the
advantageous
sale
of
his
products
and
inasmuch
as
foreign
markets
must
largely
be
the
destination
of
such
products
it
is
quite
apparent
that
a
knowledge
of
the
conditions
and
wants
that
affect
those
markets
ought
to
result
in
sowing
more
intelligently
and
reaping
with
a
better
promise
of
profit
such
information
points
out
the
way
to
a
prudent
foresight
in
the
selection
and
cultivation
of
crops
and
to
a
release
from
the
bondage
of
unreasoning
monotony
of
production
a
glutted
and
depressed
market
and
constantly
recurring
unprofitable
toil
in
my
opinion
the
gratuitous
distribution
of
seeds
by
the
department
as
at
present
conducted
ought
to
be
discontinued
no
one
can
read
the
statement
of
the
secretary
on
this
subject
and
doubt
the
extravagance
and
questionable
results
of
this
practice
the
professed
friends
of
the
farmer
and
certainly
the
farmers
themselves
are
naturally
expected
to
be
willing
to
rid
a
department
devoted
to
the
promotion
of
farming
interests
of
a
feature
which
tends
so
much
to
its
discredit
the
weather
bureau
now
attached
to
the
department
of
agriculture
has
continued
to
extend
its
sphere
of
usefulness
and
by
an
uninterrupted
improvement
in
the
accuracy
of
its
forecasts
has
greatly
increased
its
efficiency
as
an
aid
and
protection
to
all
whose
occupations
are
related
to
weather
conditions
omitting
further
reference
to
the
operations
of
the
department
i
commend
the
secretarys
report
and
the
suggestions
it
contains
to
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
the
progress
made
in
civilservice
reform
furnishes
a
cause
for
the
utmost
congratulation
it
has
survived
the
doubts
of
its
friends
as
well
as
the
rancor
of
its
enemies
and
has
gained
a
permanent
place
among
the
agencies
destined
to
cleanse
our
politics
and
to
improve
economize
and
elevate
the
public
service
there
are
now
in
the
competitive
classified
service
upward
of
places
more
than
half
of
these
having
been
included
from
time
to
time
since
march
a
most
radical
and
sweeping
extension
was
made
by
executive
order
dated
the
th
day
of
may
and
if
fourthclass
postmasterships
are
not
included
in
the
statement
it
may
be
said
that
practically
all
positions
contemplated
by
the
civilservice
law
are
now
classified
abundant
reasons
exist
for
including
these
postmasterships
based
upon
economy
improved
service
and
the
peace
and
quiet
of
neighborhoods
if
however
obstacles
prevent
such
action
at
present
i
earnestly
hope
that
congress
will
without
increasing
postoffice
appropriations
so
adjust
them
as
to
permit
in
proper
eases
a
consolidation
of
these
postoffices
to
the
end
that
through
this
process
the
result
desired
may
to
a
limited
extent
be
accomplished
the
civilservice
rules
as
amended
during
the
last
year
provide
for
a
sensible
and
uniform
method
of
promotion
basing
eligibility
to
better
positions
upon
demonstrated
efficiency
and
faithfulness
the
absence
of
fixed
rules
on
this
subject
has
been
an
infirmity
in
the
system
more
and
more
apparent
as
its
other
benefits
have
been
better
appreciated
the
advantages
of
civilservice
methods
in
their
business
aspects
are
too
well
understood
to
require
argument
their
application
has
become
a
necessity
to
the
executive
work
of
the
government
but
those
who
gain
positions
through
the
operation
of
these
methods
should
be
made
to
understand
that
the
nonpartisan
scheme
through
which
they
receive
their
appointments
demands
from
them
by
way
of
reciprocity
nonpartisan
and
faithful
performance
of
duty
under
every
administration
and
cheerful
fidelity
to
every
chief
while
they
should
be
encouraged
to
decently
exercise
their
rights
of
citizenship
and
to
support
through
their
suffrages
the
political
beliefs
they
honestly
profess
the
noisy
pestilent
and
partisan
employee
who
loves
political
turmoil
and
contention
or
who
renders
lax
and
grudging
service
to
an
administration
not
representing
his
political
views
should
be
promptly
and
fearlessly
dealt
with
in
such
a
way
as
to
furnish
a
warning
to
others
who
may
be
likewise
disposed
the
annual
report
of
the
commissioners
will
be
duly
transmitted
and
i
commend
the
important
matter
they
have
in
charge
to
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
during
the
last
year
supplied
abundant
evidence
of
its
usefulness
and
the
importance
of
the
work
committed
to
its
charge
public
transportation
is
a
universal
necessity
and
the
question
of
just
and
reasonable
charges
therefor
has
become
of
vital
importance
not
only
to
shippers
and
carriers
but
also
to
the
vast
multitude
of
producers
and
consumers
the
justice
and
equity
of
the
principles
embodied
in
the
existing
law
passed
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
these
charges
are
everywhere
conceded
and
there
appears
to
be
no
question
that
the
policy
thus
entered
upon
has
a
permanent
place
in
our
legislation
as
the
present
statute
when
enacted
was
in
the
nature
of
the
case
more
or
less
tentative
and
experimental
it
was
hardly
expected
to
supply
a
complete
and
adequate
system
while
its
wholesome
effects
are
manifest
and
have
amply
justified
its
enactment
it
is
evident
that
all
desired
reforms
in
transportation
methods
have
not
been
fully
accomplished
in
view
of
the
judicial
interpretation
which
some
provisions
of
this
statute
have
received
and
the
defects
disclosed
by
the
efforts
made
for
its
enforcement
its
revision
and
amendment
appear
to
be
essential
to
the
end
that
it
may
more
effectually
reach
the
evils
designed
to
be
corrected
i
hope
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
upon
this
subject
will
be
promptly
and
favorably
considered
by
the
congress
i
desire
to
recur
to
the
statements
elsewhere
made
concerning
the
governments
receipts
and
expenditures
for
the
purpose
of
venturing
upon
some
suggestions
touching
our
present
tariff
law
and
its
operation
this
statute
took
effect
on
the
th
day
of
august
whatever
may
be
its
shortcomings
as
a
complete
measure
of
tariff
reform
it
must
be
conceded
that
it
has
opened
the
way
to
a
freer
and
greater
exchange
of
commodities
between
us
and
other
countries
and
thus
furnished
a
wider
market
for
our
products
and
manufactures
the
only
entire
fiscal
year
during
which
this
law
has
been
in
force
ended
on
the
th
day
of
june
in
that
year
our
imports
increased
over
those
of
the
previous
year
more
than
while
the
value
of
the
domestic
products
we
exported
and
which
found
markets
abroad
was
nearly
more
than
during
the
preceding
year
those
who
insist
that
the
cost
to
our
people
of
articles
coming
to
them
from
abroad
for
their
needful
use
should
only
be
increased
through
tariff
charges
to
an
extent
necessary
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
government
as
well
as
those
who
claim
that
tariff
charges
may
be
laid
upon
such
articles
beyond
the
necessities
of
government
revenue
and
with
the
additional
purpose
of
so
increasing
their
price
in
our
markets
as
to
give
american
manufacturers
and
producers
better
and
more
profitable
opportunities
must
agree
that
our
tariff
laws
are
only
primarily
justified
as
sources
of
revenue
to
enable
the
government
to
meet
the
necessary
expenses
of
its
maintenance
considered
as
to
its
efficiency
in
this
aspect
the
present
law
can
by
no
means
fall
under
just
condemnation
during
the
only
complete
fiscal
year
of
its
operation
it
has
yielded
nearly
more
revenue
than
was
received
from
tariff
duties
in
the
preceding
year
there
was
nevertheless
a
deficit
between
our
receipts
and
expenditures
of
a
little
more
than
this
however
was
not
unexpected
the
situation
was
such
in
december
last
seven
months
before
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
foretold
a
deficiency
of
the
great
and
increasing
apprehension
and
timidity
in
business
circles
and
the
depression
in
all
activities
intervening
since
that
time
resulting
from
causes
perfectly
well
understood
and
entirely
disconnected
with
our
tariff
law
or
its
operation
seriously
checked
the
imports
we
would
have
otherwise
received
and
readily
account
for
the
difference
between
this
estimate
of
the
secretary
and
the
actual
deficiency
as
well
as
for
a
continued
deficit
indeed
it
must
be
confessed
that
we
could
hardly
have
had
a
more
unfavorable
period
than
the
last
two
years
for
the
collection
of
tariff
revenue
we
can
not
reasonably
hope
that
our
recuperation
from
this
business
depression
will
be
sudden
but
it
has
already
set
in
with
a
promise
of
acceleration
and
continuance
i
believe
our
present
tarif
f
law
if
allowed
a
fair
opportunity
will
in
the
near
future
yield
a
revenue
which
with
reasonably
economical
expenditures
will
overcome
all
deficiencies
in
the
meantime
no
deficit
that
has
occurred
or
may
occur
need
excite
or
disturb
us
to
meet
any
such
deficit
we
have
in
the
treasury
in
addition
to
a
gold
reserve
of
one
hundred
millions
a
surplus
of
more
than
applicable
to
the
payment
of
the
expenses
of
the
government
and
which
must
unless
expended
for
that
purpose
remain
a
useless
hoard
or
if
not
extravagantly
wasted
must
in
any
event
be
perverted
from
the
purpose
of
its
exaction
from
our
people
the
payment
therefore
of
any
deficiency
in
the
revenue
from
this
fund
is
nothing
more
than
its
proper
and
legitimate
use
the
government
thus
applying
a
surplus
fortunately
in
its
treasury
to
the
payment
of
expenses
not
met
by
its
current
revenues
is
not
at
all
to
be
likened
to
a
man
living
beyond
his
income
and
thus
incurring
debt
or
encroaching
on
his
principal
it
is
not
one
of
the
functions
of
our
government
to
accumulate
and
make
additions
to
a
fund
not
needed
for
immediate
expenditure
with
individuals
it
is
the
chief
object
of
struggle
and
effort
the
application
of
an
accumulated
fund
by
the
government
to
the
payment
of
its
running
expenses
is
a
duty
an
individual
living
beyond
his
income
and
embarrassing
himself
with
debt
or
drawing
upon
his
accumulated
fund
of
principal
is
either
unfortunate
or
improvident
the
distinction
is
between
a
government
charged
with
the
duty
of
expending
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
and
for
proper
purposes
all
the
money
it
receives
from
any
source
and
the
individual
who
is
expected
to
manifest
a
natural
desire
to
avoid
debt
or
to
accumulate
as
much
as
possible
and
to
live
within
the
income
derived
from
such
accumulations
to
the
end
that
they
may
be
increased
or
at
least
remain
unimpaired
for
the
future
use
and
enjoyment
of
himself
or
the
objects
of
his
love
and
affection
who
may
survive
him
it
is
immeasurably
better
to
appropriate
our
surplus
to
the
payment
of
justifiable
expenses
than
to
allow
it
to
become
an
invitation
to
reckless
appropriations
and
extravagant
expenditures
i
suppose
it
will
not
be
denied
that
under
the
present
law
our
people
obtain
the
necessaries
of
a
comfortable
existence
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
formerly
this
is
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
since
it
is
the
palpable
duty
of
every
just
government
to
make
the
burdens
of
taxation
as
light
as
possible
the
people
should
not
be
required
to
relinquish
this
privilege
of
cheaper
living
except
under
the
stress
of
their
governments
necessity
made
plainly
manifest
this
reference
to
the
condition
and
prospects
of
our
revenues
naturally
suggests
an
allusion
to
the
weakness
and
vices
of
our
financial
methods
they
have
been
frequently
pressed
upon
the
attention
of
congress
in
previous
executive
communications
and
the
inevitable
danger
of
their
continued
toleration
pointed
out
without
now
repeating
these
details
i
can
not
refrain
from
again
earnestly
presenting
the
necessity
of
the
prompt
reform
of
a
system
opposed
to
every
rule
of
sound
finance
and
shown
by
experience
to
be
fraught
with
the
gravest
peril
and
perplexity
the
terrible
civil
war
which
shook
the
foundations
of
our
government
more
than
thirty
years
ago
brought
in
its
train
the
destruction
of
property
the
wasting
of
our
countrys
substance
and
the
estrangement
of
brethren
these
are
now
past
and
forgotten
even
the
distressing
loss
of
life
the
conflict
entailed
is
but
a
sacred
memory
which
fosters
patriotic
sentiment
and
keeps
alive
a
tender
regard
for
those
who
nobly
died
and
yet
there
remains
with
us
today
in
full
strength
and
activity
as
an
incident
of
that
tremendous
struggle
a
feature
of
its
financial
necessities
not
only
unsuited
to
our
present
circumstances
but
manifestly
a
disturbing
menace
to
business
security
and
an
everpresent
agent
of
monetary
distress
because
we
may
be
enjoying
a
temporary
relief
from
its
depressing
influence
this
should
not
lull
us
into
a
false
security
nor
lead
us
to
forget
the
suddenness
of
past
visitations
i
am
more
convinced
than
ever
that
we
can
have
no
assured
financial
peace
and
safety
until
the
government
currency
obligations
upon
which
gold
may
be
demanded
from
the
treasury
are
withdrawn
from
circulation
and
canceled
this
might
be
done
as
has
been
heretofore
recommended
by
their
exchange
for
longterm
bonds
bearing
a
low
rate
of
interest
or
by
their
redemption
with
the
proceeds
of
such
bonds
even
if
only
the
united
states
notes
known
as
greenbacks
were
thus
retired
it
is
probable
that
the
treasury
notes
issued
in
payment
of
silver
purchases
under
the
act
of
july
now
paid
in
gold
when
demanded
would
not
create
much
disturbance
as
they
might
from
time
to
time
when
received
in
the
treasury
by
redemption
in
gold
or
otherwise
be
gradually
and
prudently
replaced
by
silver
coin
this
plan
of
issuing
bonds
for
the
purpose
of
redemption
certainly
appears
to
be
the
most
effective
and
direct
path
to
the
needed
reform
in
default
of
this
however
it
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
if
currency
obligations
redeemable
in
gold
whenever
so
redeemed
should
be
canceled
instead
of
being
reissued
this
operation
would
be
a
slow
remedy
but
it
would
improve
present
conditions
national
banks
should
redeem
their
own
notes
they
should
be
allowed
to
issue
circulation
to
the
par
value
of
bonds
deposited
as
security
for
its
redemption
and
the
tax
on
their
circulation
should
be
reduced
to
onefourth
of
per
cent
in
considering
projects
for
the
retirement
of
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
issued
under
the
law
of
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
we
have
placed
too
much
stress
upon
the
danger
of
contracting
the
currency
and
have
calculated
too
little
upon
the
gold
that
would
be
added
to
our
circulation
if
invited
to
us
by
better
and
safer
financial
methods
it
is
not
so
much
a
contraction
of
our
currency
that
should
be
avoided
as
its
unequal
distribution
this
might
be
obviated
and
any
fear
of
harmful
contraction
at
the
same
time
removed
by
allowing
the
organization
of
smaller
banks
and
in
less
populous
communities
than
are
now
permitted
and
also
authorizing
existing
banks
to
establish
branches
in
small
communities
under
proper
restrictions
the
entire
case
may
be
presented
by
the
statement
that
the
day
of
sensible
and
sound
financial
methods
will
not
dawn
upon
us
until
our
government
abandons
the
banking
business
and
the
accumulation
of
funds
and
confines
its
monetary
operations
to
the
receipt
of
the
money
contributed
by
the
people
for
its
support
and
to
the
expenditure
of
such
money
for
the
peoples
benefit
our
business
interests
and
all
good
citizens
long
for
rest
from
feverish
agitation
and
the
inauguration
by
the
government
of
a
reformed
financial
policy
which
will
encourage
enterprise
and
make
certain
the
rewards
of
labor
and
industry
another
topic
in
which
our
people
rightfully
take
a
deep
interest
may
be
here
briefly
considered
i
refer
to
the
existence
of
trusts
and
other
huge
aggregations
of
capital
the
object
of
which
is
to
secure
the
monopoly
of
some
particular
branch
of
trade
industry
or
commerce
and
to
stifle
wholesome
competition
when
these
are
defended
it
is
usually
on
the
ground
that
though
they
increase
profits
they
also
reduce
prices
and
thus
may
benefit
the
public
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
a
reduction
of
prices
to
the
people
is
not
one
of
the
real
objects
of
these
organizations
nor
is
their
tendency
necessarily
in
that
direction
if
it
occurs
in
a
particular
case
it
is
only
because
it
accords
with
the
purposes
or
interests
of
those
managing
the
scheme
such
occasional
results
fall
far
short
of
compensating
the
palpable
evils
charged
to
the
account
of
trusts
and
monopolies
their
tendency
is
to
crush
out
individual
independence
and
to
hinder
or
prevent
the
free
use
of
human
faculties
and
the
full
development
of
human
character
through
them
the
farmer
the
artisan
and
the
small
trader
is
in
danger
of
dislodgment
from
the
proud
position
of
being
his
own
master
watchful
of
all
that
touches
his
countrys
prosperity
in
which
he
has
an
individual
lot
and
interested
in
all
that
affects
the
advantages
of
business
of
which
he
is
a
factor
to
be
relegated
to
the
level
of
a
mere
appurtenance
to
a
great
machine
with
little
free
will
with
no
duty
but
that
of
passive
obedience
and
with
little
hope
or
opportunity
of
rising
in
the
scale
of
responsible
and
helpful
citizenship
to
the
instinctive
belief
that
such
is
the
inevitable
trend
of
trusts
and
monopolies
is
due
the
widespread
and
deepseated
popular
aversion
in
which
they
are
held
and
the
not
unreasonable
insistence
that
whatever
may
be
their
incidental
economic
advantages
their
general
effect
upon
personal
character
prospects
and
usefulness
can
not
be
otherwise
than
injurious
though
congress
has
attempted
to
deal
with
this
matter
by
legislation
the
laws
passed
for
that
purpose
thus
far
have
proved
ineffective
not
because
of
any
lack
of
disposition
or
attempt
to
enforce
them
but
simply
because
the
laws
themselves
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
do
not
reach
the
difficulty
if
the
insufficiencies
of
existing
laws
can
be
remedied
by
further
legislation
it
should
be
done
the
fact
must
be
recognized
however
that
all
federal
legislation
on
this
subject
may
fall
short
of
its
purpose
because
of
inherent
obstacles
and
also
because
of
the
complex
character
of
our
governmental
system
which
while
making
the
federal
authority
supreme
within
its
sphere
has
carefully
limited
that
sphere
by
metes
and
bounds
that
can
not
be
transgressed
the
decision
of
our
highest
court
on
this
precise
question
renders
it
quite
doubtful
whether
the
evils
of
trusts
and
monopolies
can
be
adequately
treated
through
federal
action
unless
they
seek
directly
and
purposely
to
include
in
their
objects
transportation
or
intercourse
between
states
or
between
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries
it
does
not
follow
however
that
this
is
the
limit
of
the
remedy
that
may
be
applied
even
though
it
may
be
found
that
federal
authority
is
not
broad
enough
to
fu
lly
reach
the
case
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
power
of
the
several
states
to
act
effectively
in
the
premises
and
there
should
be
no
reason
to
doubt
their
willingness
to
judiciously
exercise
such
power
in
concluding
this
communication
its
last
words
shall
be
an
appeal
to
the
congress
for
the
most
rigid
economy
in
the
expenditure
of
the
money
it
holds
in
trust
for
the
people
the
way
to
perplexing
extravagance
is
easy
but
a
return
to
frugality
is
difficult
when
however
it
is
considered
that
those
who
bear
the
burdens
of
taxation
have
no
guaranty
of
honest
care
save
in
the
fidelity
of
their
public
servants
the
duty
of
all
possible
retrenchment
is
plainly
manifest
when
our
differences
are
forgotten
and
our
contests
of
political
opinion
are
no
longer
remembered
nothing
in
the
retrospect
of
our
public
service
will
be
as
fortunate
and
comforting
as
the
recollection
of
official
duty
well
performed
and
the
memory
of
a
constant
devotion
to
the
interests
of
our
confiding
fellowcountrymen

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
present
assemblage
of
the
legislative
branch
of
our
government
occurs
at
a
time
when
the
interests
of
our
people
and
the
needs
of
the
country
give
especial
prominence
to
the
condition
of
our
foreign
relations
and
the
exigencies
of
our
national
finances
the
reports
of
the
heads
of
the
several
administrative
departments
of
the
government
fully
and
plainly
exhibit
what
has
been
accomplished
within
the
scope
of
their
respective
duties
and
present
such
recommendations
for
the
betterment
of
our
countrys
condition
as
patriotic
and
intelligent
labor
and
observation
suggest
i
therefore
deem
my
executive
duty
adequately
performed
at
this
time
by
presenting
to
the
congress
the
important
phases
of
our
situation
as
related
to
our
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
and
a
statement
of
the
financial
problems
which
confront
us
omitting
except
as
they
are
related
to
these
topics
any
reference
to
departmental
operations
i
earnestly
invite
however
not
only
the
careful
consideration
but
the
severely
critical
scrutiny
of
the
congress
and
my
fellowcountrymen
to
the
reports
concerning
these
departmental
operations
if
justly
and
fairly
examined
they
will
furnish
proof
of
assiduous
and
painstaking
care
for
the
public
welfare
i
press
the
recommendations
they
contain
upon
the
respectful
attention
of
those
charged
with
the
duty
of
legislation
because
i
believe
their
adoption
would
promote
the
peoples
good
by
amendatory
tariff
legislation
in
january
last
the
argentine
republic
recognizing
the
value
of
the
large
market
opened
to
the
free
importation
of
its
wools
under
our
last
tariff
act
has
admitted
certain
products
of
the
united

to
entry
at
reduced
duties
it
is
pleasing
to
note
that
the
efforts
we
have
made
to
enlarge
the
exchanges
of
trade
on
a
sound
basis
of
mutual
benefit
are
in
this
instance
appreciated
by

resulted
in
an
award
in
favor
of

upon
the

and
documentary
evidence
presented
thus
ending
a
longprotracted
controversy
and
again
demonstrating
the
wisdom
and
desirability
of
settling
international
boundary
disputes
by
recourse
to
friendly
arbitration
negotiations
are
progressing
for
a
revival
of

commission
whose
work
was
abruptly
terminated
last
year
by
the
expiration
of
the
stipulated
time
within
which
awards
could
be
made
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
by
chile
is
a
step
of
great
interest
and
importance
both
in
its
direct
consequences
upon
her
own
welfare
and
as
evincing
the
ascendency
of
sound
financial
principles
in
one
of
the
most
influential
of
the
south
american
republics
the
close
of
the
momentous
struggle
between
china
and
japan
while
relieving
the
diplomatic
agents
of
this
government
from
the
delicate
duty
they
undertook
at
the
request
of
both
countries
of
rendering
such
service
to
the
subjects
of
either
belligerent
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
other
as
our
neutral
position
permitted
developed
a
domestic
condition
in
the
chinese
empire
which
has
caused
much
anxiety
and
called
for
prompt
and
careful
attention
either
as
a
result
of
a
weak
control
by
the
central
government
over
the
provincial
administrations
following
a
diminution
of
traditional
governmental
authority
under
the
stress
of
an
overwhelming
national
disaster
or
as
a
manifestation
upon
good
opportunity
of
the
aversion
of
the
chinese
population
to
all
foreign
ways
and
undertakings
there
have
occurred
in
widely
separated
provinces
of
china
serious
outbreaks
of
the
old
fanatical
spirit
against
foreigners
which
unchecked
by
the
local
authorities
if
not
actually
connived
at
by
them
have
culminated
in
mob
attacks
on
foreign
missionary
stations
causing
much
destruction
of
property
and
attended
with
personal
injuries
as
well
as
loss
of
life
although
but
one
american
citizen
was
reported
to
have
been
actually
wounded
and
although
the
destruction
of
property
may
have
fallen
more
heavily
upon
the
missionaries
of
other
nationalities
than
our
own
it
plainly
behooved
this
government
to
take
the
most
prompt
and
decided
action
to
guard
against
similar
or
perhaps
more
dreadful
calamities
befalling
the
hundreds
of
american
mission
stations
which
have
grown
up
throughout
the
interior
of
china
under
the
temperate
rule
of
toleration
custom
and
imperial
edict
the
demands
of
the
united
states
and
other
powers
for
the
degradation
and
punishment
of
the
responsible
officials
of
the
respective
cities
and
provinces
who
by
neglect
or
otherwise
had
permitted
uprisings
and
for
the
adoption
of
stern
measures
by
the
emperors
government
for
the
protection
of
the
life
and
property
of
foreigners
were
followed
by
the
disgrace
and
dismissal
of
certain
provincial
officials
found
derelict
in
duty
and
the
punishment
by
death
of
a
number
of
those
adjudged
guilty
of
actual
participation
in
the
outrages
this
government
also
insisted
that
a
special
american
commission
should
visit
the
province
where
the
first
disturbances
occurred
for
the
purpose
of
investigation
the
latter
commission
formed
after
much
opposition
has
gone
overland
from
tientsin
accompanied
by
a
suitable
chinese
escort
and
by
its
demonstration
of
the
readiness
and
ability
of
our
government
to
protect
its
citizens
will
act
it
is
believed
as
a
most
influential
deterrent
of
any
similar
outbreaks
the
energetic
steps
we
have
thus
taken
are
all
the
more
likely
to
result
in
future
safety
to
our
citizens
in
china
because
the
imperial
government
is
i
am
persuaded
entirely
convinced
that
we
desire
only
the
liberty
and
protection
of
our
own
citizens
and
redress
for
any
wrongs
they
may
have
suffered
and
that
we
have
no
ulterior
designs
or
objects
political
or
otherwise
china
will
not
forget
either
our
kindly
service
to
her
citizens
during
her
late
war
nor
the
further
fact
that
while
furnishing
all
the
facilities
at
our
command
to
further
the
negotiation
of
a
peace
between
her
and
japan
we
sought
no
advantages
and
interposed
no
counsel
the
governments
of
both
china
and
japan
have
in
special
dispatches
transmitted
through
their
respective
diplomatic
representatives
expressed
in
a
most
pleasing
manner
their
grateful
appreciation
of
our
assistance
to
their
citizens
during
the
unhappy
struggle
and
of
the
value
of
our
aid
in
paving
the
way
to
their
resumption
of
peaceful
relations
the
customary
cordial
relations
between
this
country
and
france
have
been
undisturbed
with
the
exception
that
a
full
explanation
of
the
treatment
of
john
l
waller
by
the
expeditionary
military
authorities
of
france
still
remains
to
be
given
mr
waller
formerly
united
states
consul
at
tamatav
remained
in
madagascar
after
his
term
of
office
expired
and
was
apparently
successful
in
procuring
business
concessions
from
the
hovas
of
greater
or
less
value
after
the
occupation
of
tamatav
and
the
declaration
of
martial
law
by
the
french
he
was
arrested
upon
various
charges
among
them
that
of
communicating
military
information
to
the
enemies
of
france
was
tried
and
convicted
by
a
military
tribunal
and
sentenced
to
twenty
years
imprisonment
following
the
course
justified
by
abundant
precedents
this
government
requested
from
that
of
france
the
record
of
the
proceedings
of
the
french
tribunal
which
resulted
in
mr
wallers
condemnation
this
request
has
been
complied
with
to
the
extent
of
supplying
a
copy
of
the
official
record
from
which
appear
the
constitution
and
organization
of
the
court
the
charges
as
formulated
and
the
general
course
and
result
of
the
trial
and
by
which
it
is
shown
that
the
accused
was
tried
in
open
court
and
was
defended
by
counsel
but
the
evidence
adduced
in
support
of
the
charges
which
was
not
received
by
the
french
minister
for
foreign
affairs
till
the
first
week
in
october
has
thus
far
been
withheld
the
french
government
taking
the
ground
that
its
production
in
response
to
our
demand
would
establish
a
bad
precedent
the
efforts
of
our
ambassador
to
procure
it
however
though
impeded
by
recent
changes
in
the
french
ministry
have
not
been
relaxed
and
it
is
confidently
expected
that
some
satisfactory
solution
of
the
matter
will
shortly
be
reached
meanwhile
it
appears
that
mr
wallers
confinement
has
every
alleviation
which
the
state
of
his
health
and
all
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case
demand
or
permit
in
agreeable
contrast
to
the
difference
above
noted
respecting
a
matter
of
common
concern
where
nothing
is
sought
except
such
a
mutually
satisfactory
outcome
as
the
true
merits
of
the
case
require
is
the
recent
resolution
of
the
french
chambers
favoring
the
conclusion
of
a
permanent
treaty
of
arbitration
between
the
two
countries
an
invitation
has
been
extended
by
france
to
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
to
participate
in
a
great
international
exposition
at
paris
in
as
a
suitable
commemoration
of
the
close
of
this
the
worlds
marvelous
century
of
progress
i
heartily
recommend
its
acceptance
together
with
such
legislation
as
will
adequately
provide
for
a
due
representation
of
this
government
and
its
people
on
the
occasion
our
relations
with
the
states
of
the
german
empire
are
in
some
aspects
typical
of
a
condition
of
things
elsewhere
found
in
countries
whose
productions
and
trade
are
similar
to
our
own
the
close
rivalries
of
competing
industries
the
influence
of
the
delusive
doctrine
that
the
internal
development
of
a
nation
is
promoted
and
its
wealth
increased
by
a
policy
which
in
undertaking
to
reserve
its
home
markets
for
the
exclusive
use
of
its
own
producers
necessarily
obstructs
their
sales
in
foreign
markets
and
prevents
free
access
to
the
products
of
the
world
the
desire
to
retain
trade
in
timeworn
ruts
regardless
of
the
inexorable
laws
of
new
needs
and
changed
conditions
of
demand
and
supply
and
our
own
halting
tardiness
in
inviting
a
freer
exchang
e
of
commodities
and
by
this
means
imperiling
our
footing
in
the
external
markets
naturally
open
to
us
have
created
a
situation
somewhat
injurious
to
american
export
interests
not
only
in
germany
where
they
are
perhaps
most
noticeable
but
in
adjacent
countries
the
exports
affected
are
largely
american
cattle
and
other
food
products
the
reason
assigned
for
unfavorable
discrimination
being
that
their
consumption
is
deleterious
to
the
public
health
this
is
all
the
more
irritating
in
view
of
the
fact
that
no
european
state
is
as
jealous
of
the
excellence
and
wholesomeness
of
its
exported
food
supplies
as
the
united
states
nor
so
easily
able
on
account
of
inherent
soundness
to
guarantee
those
qualities
nor
are
these
difficulties
confined
to
our
food
products
designed
for
exportation
our
great
insurance
companies
for
example
having
built
up
a
vast
business
abroad
and
invested
a
large
share
of
their
gains
in
foreign
countries
in
compliance
with
the
local
laws
and
regulations
then
existing
now
find
themselves
within
a
narrowing
circle
of
onerous
and
unforeseen
conditions
and
are
confronted
by
the
necessity
of
retirement
from
a
field
thus
made
unprofitable
if
indeed
they
are
not
summarily
expelled
as
some
of
them
have
lately
been
from
prussia
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
international
trade
can
not
be
onesided
its
currents
are
alternating
and
its
movements
should
be
honestly
reciprocal
without
this
it
almost
necessarily
degenerates
into
a
device
to
gain
advantage
or
a
contrivance
to
secure
benefits
with
only
the
semblance
of
a
return
in
our
dealings
with
other
nations
we
ought
to
be
openhanded
and
scrupulously
fair
this
should
be
our
policy
as
a
producing
nation
and
it
plainly
becomes
us
as
a
people
who
love
generosity
and
the
moral
aspects
of
national
good
faith
and
reciprocal
forbearance
these
considerations
should
not
however
constrain
us
to
submit
to
unfair
discrimination
nor
to
silently
acquiesce
in
vexatious
hindrances
to
the
enjoyment
of
our
share
of
the
legitimate
advantages
of
proper
trade
relations
if
an
examination
of
the
situation
suggests
such
measures
on
our
part
as
would
involve
restrictions
similar
to
those
from
which
we
suffer
the
way
to
such
a
course
is
easy
it
should
however
by
no
means
be
lightly
entered
upon
since
the
necessity
for
the
inauguration
of
such
a
policy
would
be
regretted
by
the
best
sentiment
of
our
people
and
because
it
naturally
and
logically
might
lead
to
consequences
of
the
gravest
character
i
take
pleasure
in
calling
to
your
attention
the
encomiums
bestowed
on
those
vessels
of
our
new
navy
which
took
part
in
the
notable
ceremony
of
the
opening
of
the
kiel
canal
it
was
fitting
that
this
extraordinary
achievement
of
the
newer
german
nationality
should
be
celebrated
in
the
presence
of
americas
exposition
of
the
latest
developments
of
the
world
s
naval
energy
our
relations
with
great
britain
always
intimate
and
important
have
demanded
during
the
past
year
even
a
greater
share
of
consideration
than
is
usual
several
vexatious
questions
were
left
undetermined
by
the
decision
of
the
bering
sea
arbitration
tribunal
the
application
of
the
principles
laid
down
by
that
august
body
has
not
been
followed
by
the
results
they
were
intended
to
accomplish
either
because
the
principles
themselves
lacked
in
breadth
and
definiteness
or
because
their
execution
has
been
more
or
less
imperfect
much
correspondence
has
been
exchanged
between
the
two
governments
on
the
subject
of
preventing
the
exterminating
slaughter
of
seals
the
insufficiency
of
the
british
patrol
of
bering
sea
under
the
regulations
agreed
on
by
the
two
governments
has
been
pointed
out
and
yet
only
two
british
ships
have
been
on
police
duty
during
this
season
in
those
waters
the
need
of
a
more
effective
enforcement
of
existing
regulations
as
well
as
the
adoption
of
such
additional
regulations
as
experience
has
shown
to
be
absolutely
necessary
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
the
award
have
been
earnestly
urged
upon
the
british
government
but
thus
far
without
effective
results
in
the
meantime
the
depletion
of
the
seal
herds
by
means
of
pelagic
hunting
has
so
alarmingly
progressed
that
unless
their
slaughter
is
at
once
effectively
checked
their
extinction
within
a
few
years
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
absolute
certainty
the
understanding
by
which
the
united
states
was
to
pay
and
great
britain
to
receive
a
lump
sum
of
in
full
settlement
of
all
british
claims
for
damages
arising
from
our
seizure
of
british
sealing
vessels
unauthorized
under
the
award
of
the
paris
tribunal
of
arbitration
was
not
confirmed
by
the
last
congress
which
declined
to
make
the
necessary
appropriation
i
am
still
of
the
opinion
that
this
arrangement
was
a
judicious
and
advantageous
one
for
the
government
and
i
earnestly
recommend
that
it
be
again
considered
and
sanctioned
if
however
this
does
not
meet
with
the
favor
of
congress
it
certainly
will
hardly
dissent
from
the
proposition
that
the
government
is
bound
by
every
consideration
of
honor
and
good
faith
to
provide
for
the
speedy
adjustment
of
these
claims
by
arbitration
as
the
only
other
alternative
a
treaty
of
arbitration
has
therefore
been
agreed
upon
and
will
be
immediately
laid
before
the
senate
so
that
in
one
of
the
modes
suggested
a
final
settlement
may
be
reached
notwithstanding
that
great
britain
originated
the
proposal
to
enforce
international
rules
for
the
prevention
of
collisions
at
sea
based
on
the
recommendations
of
the
maritime
conference
of
washington
and
concurred
in
suggesting
march
as
the
date
to
be
set
by
proclamation
for
carrying
these
rules
into
general
effect
her
majestys
government
having
encountered
opposition
on
the
part
of
british
shipping
interests
announced
its
inability
to
accept
that
date
which
was
consequently
canceled
the
entire
matter
is
still
in
abeyance
without
prospect
of
a
better
condition
in
the
near
future
the
commissioners
appointed
to
mark
the
international
boundary
in
passamaquoddy
bay
according
to
the
description
of
the
treaty
of
ghent
have
not
yet
fully
agreed
the
completion
of
the
preliminary
survey
of
that
alaskan
boundary
which
follows
the
contour
of
the
coast
from
the
southernmost
point
of
prince
of
wales
island
until
it
strikes
the
one
hundred
and
fortyfirst
meridian
at
or
near
the
summit
of
mount
st
elias
awaits
further
necessary
appropriation
which
is
urgently
recommended
this
survey
was
undertaken
under
the
provisions
of
the
convention
entered
into
by
this
country
and
great
britain
july
and
the
supplementary
convention
of
february
as
to
the
remaining
section
of
the
alaskan
boundary
which
follows
the
one
hundred
and
fortyfirst
meridian
northwardly
from
mount
st
elias
to
the
frozen
ocean
the
settlement
of
which
involves
the
physical
location
of
the
meridian
mentioned
no
conventional
agreement
has
yet
been
made
the
ascertainment
of
a
given
meridian
at
a
particular
point
is
a
work
requiring
much
time
and
careful
observations
and
surveys
such
observations
and
surveys
were
undertaken
by
the
united
states
coast
and
geodetic
survey
in
and
while
similar
work
in
the
same
quarters
under
british
auspices
is
believed
to
give
nearly
coincident
results
but
these
surveys
have
been
independently
conducted
and
no
international
agreement
to
mark
those
or
any
other
parts
of
the
one
hundred
and
fortyfirst
meridian
by
permanent
monuments
has
yet
been
made
in
the
meantime
the
valley
of
the
yukon
is
becoming
a
highway
through
the
hitherto
unexplored
wilds
of
alaska
and
abundant
mineral
wealth
has
been
discovered
in
that
region
especially
at
or
near
the
junction
of
the
boundary
meridian
with
the
yukon
and
its
tributaries
in
these
circumstances
it
is
expedient
and
indeed
imperative
that
the
jurisdictional
limits
of
the
respective
governments
in
this
new
region
be
speedily
determined
her
britannic
majestys
government
has
proposed
a
joint
delimitation
of
the
one
hundred
and
fortyfirst
meridian
by
an
international
commission
of
experts
which
if
congress
will
authorize
it
and
make
due
provision
therefor
can
be
accomplished
with
no
unreasonable
delay
it
is
impossible
to
overlook
the
vital
importance
of
continuing
the
work
already
entered
upon
and
supplementing
it
by
further
effective
measures
looking
to
the
exact
location
of
this
entire
boundary
line
i
call
attention
to
the
unsatisfactory
delimitation
of
the
respective
jurisdictions
of
the
united
states
and
the
dominion
of
canada
in
the
great
lakes
at
the
approaches
to
the
narrow
waters
that
connect
them
the
waters
in
question
are
frequented
by
fishermen
of
both
nationalities
and
their
nets
are
there
used
owing
to
the
uncertainty
and
ignorance
as
to
the
true
boundary
vexations
disputes
and
injurious
seizures
of
boats
and
nets
by
canadian
cruisers
often
occur
while
any
positive
settlement
thereof
by
an
accepted
standard
is
not
easily
to
be
reached
a
joint
commission
to
determine
the
line
in
those
quarters
on
a
practical
basis
by
measured
courses
following
range
marks
on
shore
is
a
necessity
for
which
immediate
provision
should
be
made
it
being
apparent
that
the
boundary
dispute
between
great
britain
and
the
republic
of
venezuela
concerning
the
limits
of
british
guiana
was
approaching
an
acute
stage
a
definite
statement
of
the
interest
and
policy
of
the
united
states
as
regards
the
controversy
seemed
to
be
required
both
on
its
own
account
and
in
view
of
its
relations
with
the
friendly
powers
directly
concerned
in
july
last
therefore
a
dispatch
was
addressed
to
our
ambassador
at
london
for
communication
to
the
british
government
in
which
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
was
fully
and
distinctly
set
forth
the
general
conclusions
therein
reached
and
formulated
are
in
substance
that
the
traditional
and
established
policy
of
this
government
is
firmly
opposed
to
a
forcible
increase
by
any
european
power
of
its
territorial
possessions
on
this
continent
that
this
policy
is
as
well
rounded
in
principle
as
it
is
strongly
supported
by
numerous
precedents
that
as
a
consequence
the
united
states
is
bound
to
protest
against
the
enlargement
of
the
area
of
british
guian
a
in
derogation
of
the
rights
and
against
the
will
of
venezuela
that
considering
the
disparity
in
strength
of
great
britain
and
venezuela
the
territorial
dispute
between
them
can
be
reasonably
settled
only
by
friendly
and
impartial
arbitration
and
that
the
resort
to
such
arbitration
should
include
the
whole
controversy
and
is
not
satisfied
if
one
of
the
powers
concerned
is
permitted
to
draw
an
arbitrary
line
through
the
territory
in
debate
and
to
declare
that
it
will
submit
to
arbitration
only
the
portion
lying
on
one
side
of
it
in
view
of
these
conclusions
the
dispatch
in
question
called
upon
the
british
government
for
a
definite
answer
to
the
question
whether
it
would
or
would
not
submit
the
territorial
controversy
between
itself
and
venezuela
in
its
entirety
to
impartial
arbitration
the
answer
of
the
british
government
has
not
yet
been
received
but
is
expected
shortly
when
further
communication
on
the
subject
will
probably
be
made
to
the
congress
early
in
january
last
an
uprising
against
the
government
of
hawaii
was
promptly
suppressed
martial
law
was
forthwith
proclaimed
and
numerous
arrests
were
made
of
persons
suspected
of
being
in
sympathy
with
the
royalist
party
among
these
were
several
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
were
either
convicted
by
a
military
court
and
sentenced
to
death
imprisonment
or
fine
or
were
deported
without
trial
the
united
states
while
denying
protection
to
such
as
had
taken
the
hawaiian
oath
of
allegiance
insisted
that
martial
law
though
altering
the
forms
of
justice
could
not
supersede
justice
itself
and
demanded
stay
of
execution
until
the
proceedings
had
been
submitted
to
this
government
and
knowledge
obtained
therefrom
that
our
citizens
had
received
fair
trial
the
death
sentences
were
subsequently
commuted
or
were
remitted
on
condition
of
leaving
the
islands
the
cases
of
certain
americans
arrested
and
expelled
by
arbitrary
order
without
formal
charge
or
trial
have
had
attention
and
in
some
instances
have
been
found
to
justify
remonstrance
and
a
claim
for
indemnity
which
hawaii
has
not
thus
far
conceded
mr
thurston
the
hawaiian
minister
having
furnished
this
government
abundant
reason
for
asking
that
he
be
recalled
that
course
was
pursued
and
his
successor
has
lately
been
received
the
deplorable
lynching
of
several
italian
laborers
in
colorado
was
naturally
followed
by
international
representations
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
the
best
efforts
of
the
state
in
which
the
outrages
occurred
have
been
put
forth
to
discover
and
punish
the
authors
of
this
atrocious
crime
the
dependent
families
of
some
of
the
unfortunate
victims
invite
by
their
deplorable
condition
gracious
provision
for
their
needs
these
manifestations
against
helpless
aliens
may
be
traced
through
successive
stages
to
the
vicious
padroni
system
which
unchecked
by
our
immigration
and
contractlabor
statutes
controls
these
workers
from
the
moment
of
landing
on
our
shores
and
farms
them
out
in
distant
and
often
rude
regions
where
their
cheapening
competition
in
the
fields
of
breadwinning
toil
brings
them
into
collision
with
other
labor
interests
while
welcoming
as
we
should
those
who
seek
our
shores
to
merge
themselves
in
our
body
politic
and
win
personal
competence
by
honest
effort
we
can
not
regard
such
assemblages
of
distinctively
alien
laborers
hired
out
in
the
mass
to
the
profit
of
alien
speculators
and
shipped
hither
and
thither
as
the
prospect
of
gain
may
dictate
as
otherwise
than
repugnant
to
the
spirit
of
our
civilization
deterrent
to
individual
advancement
and
hindrances
to
the
building
up
of
stable
communities
resting
upon
the
wholesome
ambitions
of
the
citizen
and
constituting
the
prime
factor
in
the
prosperity
and
progress
of
our
nation
if
legislation
can
reach
this
growing
evil
it
certainly
should
be
attempted
japan
has
furnished
abundant
evidence
of
her
vast
gain
in
every
trait
and
characteristic
that
constitutes
a
nations
greatness
we
have
reason
for
congratulation
in
the
fact
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
the
exchange
of
liberal
treaty
stipulations
with
the
new
japan
was
the
first
to
recognize
her
wonderful
advance
and
to
extend
to
her
the
consideration
and
confidence
due
to
her
national
enlightenment
and
progressive
character
the
boundary
dispute
which
lately
threatened
to
embroil
guatemala
and
mexico
has
happily
yielded
to
pacific
counsels
and
its
determination
has
by
the
joint
agreement
of
the
parties
been
submitted
to
the
sole
arbitration
of
the
united
states
minister
to
mexico
the
commission
appointed
under
the
convention
of
february
to
set
new
monuments
along
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
has
completed
its
task
as
a
sequel
to
the
failure
of
a
scheme
for
the
colonization
in
mexico
of
negroes
mostly
immigrants
from
alabama
under
contract
a
great
number
of
these
helpless
and
suffering
people
starving
and
smitten
with
contagious
disease
made
their
way
or
were
assisted
to
the
frontier
where
in
wretched
plight
they
were
quarantined
by
the
texas
authorities
learning
of
their
destitute
condition
i
directed
rations
to
be
temporarily
furnished
them
through
the
war
department
at
the
expiration
of
their
quarantine
they
were
conveyed
by
the
railway
companies
at
comparatively
nominal
rates
to
their
homes
in
alabama
upon
my
assurance
in
the
absence
of
any
fund
available
for
the
cost
of
their
transportation
that
i
would
recommend
to
congress
an
appropriation
for
its
payment
i
now
strongly
urge
upon
congress
the
propriety
of
making
such
an
appropriation
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
measures
taken
were
dictated
not
only
by
sympathy
and
humanity
but
by
a
conviction
that
it
was
not
compatible
with
the
dignity
of
this
government
that
so
large
a
body
of
our
dependent
citizens
should
be
thrown
for
relief
upon
the
charity
of
a
neighboring
state
in
last
years
message
i
narrated
at
some
length
the
jurisdictional
questions
then
freshly
arisen
in
the
mosquito
indian
strip
of
nicaragua
since
that
time
by
the
voluntary
act
of
the
mosquito
nation
the
territory
reserved
to
them
has
been
incorporated
with
nicaragua
the
indians
formally
subjecting
themselves
to
be
governed
by
the
general
laws
and
regulations
of
the
republic
instead
of
by
their
own
customs
and
regulations
and
thus
availing
themselves
of
a
privilege
secured
to
them
by
the
treaty
between
nicaragua
and
great
britain
of
january
after
this
extension
of
uniform
nicaraguan
administration
to
the
mosquito
strip
the
case
of
the
british
viceconsul
hatch
and
of
several
of
his
countrymen
who
had
been
summarily
expelled
from
nicaragua
and
treated
with
considerable
indignity
provoked
a
claim
by
great
britain
upon
nicaragua
for
pecuniary
indemnity
which
upon
nicaraguas
refusal
to
admit
liability
was
enforced
by
great
britain
while
the
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
of
nicaragua
was
in
no
way
questioned
by
great
britain
the
formers
arbitrary
conduct
in
regard
to
british
subjects
furnished
the
ground
for
this
proceeding
a
british
naval
force
occupied
without
resistance
the
pacific
seaport
of
corinto
but
was
soon
after
withdrawn
upon
the
promise
that
the
sum
demanded
would
be
paid
throughout
this
incident
the
kindly
offices
of
the
united
states
were
invoked
and
were
employed
in
favor
of
as
peaceful
a
settlement
and
as
much
consideration
and
indulgence
toward
nicaragua
as
were
consistent
with
the
nature
of
the
case
our
efforts
have
since
been
made
the
subject
of
appreciative
and
grateful
recognition
by
nicaragua
the
coronation
of
the
czar
of
russia
at
moscow
in

the
ceremonial
participation
of
the
united

and
in
accordance
with
usage
and
diplomatic
propriety
our
minister
to
the
imperial
court
has
been
directed
to
represent
our
government
on
the
occasion
correspondence
is
on
foot
touching
the
practice
of
russian
consuls
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
interrogate
citizens
as
to
their
race
and
religious
faith
and
upon
ascertainment
thereof
to
deny
to
jews
authentication
of
passports
or
legal
documents
for
use
in
russia
inasmuch
as
such
a
proceeding
imposes
a
disability
which
in
the
case
of
succession
to
property
in
russia
may
be
found
to
infringe
the
treaty
rights
of
our
citizens
and
which
is
an
obnoxious
invasion
of
our
territorial
jurisdiction
it
has
elicited
fitting
remonstrance
the
result
of
which
it
is
hoped
will
remove
the
cause
of
complaint
the
pending
claims
of
sealing
vessels
of
the
united
states
seized
in
russian
waters
remain
unadjusted
our
recent
convention
with
russia
establishing
a
modus
vivendi
as
to
imperial
jurisdiction
in
such
cases
has
prevented
further
difficulty
of
this
nature
the
russian
government
has
welcomed
in
principle
our
suggestion
for
a
modus
vivendi
to
embrace
great
britain
and
japan
looking
to
the
better
preservation
of
seal
life
in
the
north
pacific
and
bering
sea
and
the
extension
of
the
protected
area
defined
by
the
paris
tribunal
to
all
pacific
waters
north
of
the
thirtyfifth
parallel
it
is
especially
noticeable
that
russia
favors
prohibition
of
the
use
of
firearms
in
seal
hunting
throughout
the
proposed
area
and
a
longer
closed
season
for
pelagic
sealing
in
my
last
two
annual
messages
i
called
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
position
we
occupied
as
one
of
the
parties
to
a
treaty
or
agreement
by
which
we
became
jointly
bound
with
england
and
germany
to
so
interfere
with
the
government
and
control
of
samoa
as
in
effect
to
assume
the
management
of
its
affairs
on
the
th
day
of
may
i
transmitted
to
the
senate
a
special
message
with
accompanying
documents
giving
information
on
the
subject
and
emphasizing
the
opinion
i
have
at
all
times
entertained
that
our
situation
in
this
matter
was
inconsistent
with
the
mission
and
traditions
of
our
government
in
violation
of
the
principles
we
profess
and
in
all
its
phases
mischievous
and
vexatious
i
again
press
this
subject
upon
the
attention
of
the
congress
and
ask
for
such
legislative
action
or
expression
as
will
lead
the
way
to
our
relief
from
obligations
both
irksome
and
unnatural
cuba
is
again
gravely
disturbed
an
insurrection
in
some
r
espects
more
active
than
the
last
preceding
revolt
which
continued
from
to
now
exists
in
a
large
part
of
the
eastern
interior
of
the
island
menacing
even
some
populations
on
the
coast
besides
deranging
the
commercial
exchanges
of
the
island
of
which
our
country
takes
the
predominant
share
this
flagrant
condition
of
hostilities
by
arousing
sentimental
sympathy
and
inciting
adventurous
support
among
our
people
has
entailed
earnest
effort
on
the
part
of
this
government
to
enforce
obedience
to
our
neutrality
laws
and
to
prevent
the
territory
of
the
united
states
from
being
abused
as
a
vantage
ground
from
which
to
aid
those
in
arms
against
spanish
sovereignty
whatever
may
be
the
traditional
sympathy
of
our
countrymen
as
individuals
with
a
people
who
seem
to
be
struggling
for
larger
autonomy
and
greater
freedom
deepened
as
such
sympathy
naturally
must
be
in
behalf
of
our
neighbors
yet
the
plain
duty
of
their
government
is
to
observe
in
good
faith
the
recognized
obligations
of
international
relationship
the
performance
of
this
duty
should
not
be
made
more
difficult
by
a
disregard
on
the
part
of
our
citizens
of
the
obligations
growing
out
of
their
allegiance
to
their
country
which
should
restrain
them
from
violating
as
individuals
the
neutrality
which
the
nation
of
which
they
are
members
is
bound
to
observe
in
its
relations
to
friendly
sovereign
states
though
neither
the
warmth
of
our
peoples
sympathy
with
the
cuban
insurgents
nor
our
loss
and
material
damage
consequent
upon
the
futile
endeavors
thus
far
made
to
restore
peace
and
order
nor
any
shock
our
humane
sensibilities
may
have
received
from
the
cruelties
which
appear
to
especially
characterize
this
sanguinary
and
fiercely
conducted
war
have
in
the
least
shaken
the
determination
of
the
government
to
honestly
fulfill
every
international
obligation
yet
it
is
to
be
earnestly
hoped
on
every
ground
that
the
devastation
of
armed
conflict
may
speedily
be
stayed
and
order
and
quiet
restored
to
the
distracted
island
bringing
in
their
train
the
activity
and
thrift
of
peaceful
pursuits
one
notable
instance
of
interference
by
spain
with
passing
american
ships
has
occurred
on
march
last
the
allianca
while
bound
from
colon
to
new
york
and
following
the
customary
track
for
vessels
near
the
cuban
shore
but
outside
the
mile
limit
was
fired
upon
by
a
spanish
gunboat
protest
was
promptly
made
by
the
united
states
against
this
act
as
not
being
justified
by
a
state
of
war
nor
permissible
in
respect
of
vessels
on
the
usual
paths
of
commerce
nor
tolerable
in
view
of
the
wanton
peril
occasioned
to
innocent
life
and
property
the
act
was
disavowed
with
full
expression
of
regret
and
assurance
of
nonrecurrence
of
such
just
cause
of
complaint
while
the
offending
officer
was
relieved
of
his
command
military
arrests
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
cuba
have
occasioned
frequent
reclamations
where
held
on
criminal
charges
their
delivery
to
the
ordinary
civil
jurisdiction
for
trial
has
been
demanded
and
obtained
in
conformity
with
treaty
provisions
and
where
merely
detained
by
way
of
military
precaution
under
a
proclaimed
state
of
siege
without
formulated
accusation
their
release
or
trial
has
been
insisted
upon
the
right
of
american
consular
officers
in
the
island
to
prefer
protests
and
demands
in
such
cases
having
been
questioned
by
the
insular
authority
their
enjoyment
of
the
privilege
stipulated
by
treaty
for
the
consuls
of
germany
was
claimed
under
the
mostfavorednation
provision
of
our
own
convention
and
was
promptly
recognized
the
longstanding
demand
of
antonio
maximo
mora
against
spain
has
at
last
been
settled
by
the
payment
on
the
th
of
september
last
of
the
sum
originally
agreed
upon
in
liquidation
of
the
claim
its
distribution
among
the
parties
entitled
to
receive
it
has
proceeded
as
rapidly
as
the
rights
of
those
claiming
the
fund
could
be
safely
determined
the
enforcement
of
differential
duties
against
products
of
this
country
exported
to
cuba
and
puerto
rico
prompted
the
immediate
claim
on
our
part
to
the
benefit
of
the
minimum
tariff
of
spain
in
return
for
the
most
favorable
treatment
permitted
by
our
laws
as
regards
the
production
of
spanish
territories
a
commercial
arrangement
was
concluded
in
january
last
securing
the
treatment
so
claimed
vigorous
protests
against
excessive
fines
imposed
on
our
ships
and
merchandise
by
the
customs
officers
of
these
islands
for
trivial
errors
have
resulted
in
the
remission
of
such
fines
in
instances
where
the
equity
of
the
complaint
was
apparent
though
the
vexatious
practice
has
not
been
wholly
discontinued
occurrences
in
turkey
have
continued
to
excite
concern
the
reported
massacres
of
christians
in
armenia
and
the
development
there
and
in
other
districts
of
a
spirit
of
fanatic
hostility
to
christian
influences
naturally
excited
apprehension
for
the
safety
of
the
devoted
men
and
women
who
as
dependents
of
the
foreign
missionary
societies
in
the
united
states
reside
in
turkey
under
the
guaranty
of
law
and
usage
and
in
the
legitimate
performance
of
their
educational
and
religious
mission
no
efforts
have
been
spared
in
their
behalf
and
their
protection
in
person
and
property
has
been
earnestly
and
vigorously
enforced
by
every
means
within
our
power
i
regret
however
that
an
attempt
on
our
part
to
obtain
better
information
concerning
the
true
condition
of
affairs
in
the
disturbed
quarter
of
the
ottoman
empire
by
sending
thither
the
united
states
consul
at
sivas
to
make
investigation
and
report
was
thwarted
by
the
objections
of
the
turkish
government
this
movement
on
our
part
was
in
no
sense
meant
as
a
gratuitous
entanglement
of
the
united
states
in
the
socalled
eastern
question
nor
as
an
officious
interference
with
the
right
and
duty
which
belong
by
treaty
to
certain
great
european
powers
calling
for
their
intervention
in
political
matters
affecting
the
good
government
and
religious
freedom
of
the
nonmussulman
subjects
of
the
sultan
but
it
arose
solely
from
our
desire
to
have
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
conditions
in
our
efforts
to
care
for
those
entitled
to
our
protection
the
presence
of
our
naval
vessels
which
are
now
in
the
vicinity
of
the
disturbed
localities
affords
opportunities
to
acquire
a
measure
of
familiarity
with
the
condition
of
affairs
and
will
enable
us
to
take
suitable
steps
for
the
protection
of
any
interests
of
our
countrymen
within
reach
of
our
ships
that
might
be
found
imperiled
the
ottoman
government
has
lately
issued
an
imperial
irade
exempting
forever
from
taxation
an
american
college
for
girls
at
scutari
repeated
assurances
have
also
been
obtained
by
our
envoy
at
constantinople
that
similar
institutions
maintained
and
administered
by
our
countrymen
shall
be
secured
in
the
enjoyment
of
all
rights
and
that
our
citizens
throughout
the
empire
shall
be
protected
the
government
however
in
view
of
existing
facts
is
far
from
relying
upon
such
assurances
as
the
limit
of
its
duty
our
minister
has
been
vigilant
and
alert
in
affording
all
possible
protection
in
individual
cases
where
danger
threatened
or
safety
was
imperiled
we
have
sent
ships
as
far
toward
the
points
of
actual
disturbance
as
it
is
possible
for
them
to
go
where
they
offer
refuge
to
those
obliged
to
flee
and
we
have
the
promise
of
other
powers
which
have
ships
in
the
neighborhood
that
our
citizens
as
well
as
theirs
will
be
received
and
protected
on
board
those
ships
on
the
demand
of
our
minister
orders
have
been
issued
by
the
sultan
that
turkish
soldiers
shall
guard
and
escort
to
the
coast
american
refugees
these
orders
have
been
carried
out
and
our
latest
intelligence
gives
assurance
of
the
present
personal
safety
of
our
citizens
and
missionaries
though
thus
far
no
lives
of
american
citizens
have
been
sacrificed
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
serious
loss
and
destruction
of
mission
property
have
resulted
from
riotous
conflicts
and
outrageous
attacks
by
treaty
several
of
the
most
powerful
european
powers
have
secured
a
right
and
have
assumed
a
duty
not
only
in
behalf
of
their
own
citizens
and
in
furtherance
of
their
own
interests
but
as
agents
of
the
christian
world
their
right
is
to
enforce
such
conduct
of
turkish
government
as
will
restrain
fanatical
brutality
and
if
this
fails
their
duty
is
to
so
interfere
as
to
insure
against
such
dreadful
occurrences
in
turkey
as
have
lately
shocked
civilization
the
powers
declare
this
right
and
this
duty
to
be
theirs
alone
and
it
is
earnestly
hoped
that
prompt
and
effective
action
on
their
part
will
not
be
delayed
the
new
consulates
at
erzerum
and
harpoot
for
which
appropriation
was
made
last
session
have
been
provisionally
filled
by
trusted
employees
of
the
department
of
state
these
appointees
though
now
in
turkey
have
not
yet
received
their
exequaturs
the
arbitration
of
the
claim
of
the
venezuela
steam
transportation
company
under
the
treaty
of
january
between
the
united
states
and
venezuela
resulted
in
an
award
in
favor
of
the
claimant
the
government
has
used
its
good
offices
toward
composing
the
differences
between
venezuela
on
the
one
hand
and
france
and
belgium
on
the
other
growing
out
of
the
dismissal
of
the
representatives
of
those
powers
on
the
ground
of
a
publication
deemed
offensive
to
venezuela
although
that
dismissal
was
coupled
with
a
cordial
request
that
other
more
personally
agreeable
envoys
be
sent
in
their
stead
a
rupture
of
intercourse
ensued
and
still
continues
in
view
of
the
growth
of
our
interests
in
foreign
countries
and
the
encouraging
prospects
for
a
general
expansion
of
our
commerce
the
question
of
an
improvement
in
the
consular
service
has
increased
in
importance
and
urgency
though
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
great
body
of
consular
officers
are
rendering
valuable
services
to
the
trade
and
industries
of
the
country
the
need
of
some
plan
of
appointment
and
control
which
would
tend
to
secure
a
higher
average
of
efficiency
can
not
be
denied
the
importance
of
the
subject
has
led
the
executive
to
consider
what
steps
might
properly
be
taken
without
additional
legislation
to
answer
the
need
of
a
better
system
of
c
onsular
appointments
the
matter
having
been
committed
to
the
consideration
of
the
secretary
of
state
in
pursuance
of
his
recommendations
an
executive
order
was
issued
on
the
th
of
september
by
the
terms
of
which
it
is
provided
that
after
that
date
any
vacancy
in
a
consulate
or
commercial
agency
with
an
annual
salary
or
compensation
from
official
fees
of
not
more
than
or
less
than
should
be
filled
either
by
transfer
or
promotion
from
some
other
position
under
the
department
of
state
of
a
character
tending
to
qualify
the
incumbent
for
the
position
to
be
filled
or
by
the
appointment
of
a
person
not
under
the
department
of
state
but
having
previously
served
thereunder
and
shown
his
capacity
and
fitness
for
consular
duty
or
by
the
appointment
of
a
person
who
having
been
selected
by
the
president
and
sent
to
a
board
for
examination
is
found
upon
such
examination
to
be
qualified
for
the
position
posts
which
pay
less
than
being
usually
on
account
of
their
small
compensation
filled
by
selection
from
residents
of
the
locality
it
was
not
deemed
practicable
to
put
them
under
the
new
system
the
compensation
of
was
adopted
as
the
maximum
limit
in
the
classification
for
the
reason
that
consular
officers
receiving
more
than
that
sum
are
often
charged
with
functions
and
duties
scarcely
inferior
in
dignity
and
importance
to
those
of
diplomatic
agents
and
it
was
therefore
thought
best
to
continue
their
selection
in
the
discretion
of
the
executive
without
subjecting
them
to
examination
before
a
board
excluding
places
with
compensation
at
present
less
than
and
places
above
the
maximum
in
compensation
the
number
of
positions
remaining
within
the
scope
of
the
order
is
this
number
will
undoubtedly
be
increased
by
the
inclusion
of
consular
officers
whose
remuneration
in
fees
now
less
than
will
be
augmented
with
the
growth
of
our
foreign
commerce
and
a
return
to
more
favorable
business
conditions
in
execution
of
the
executive
order
referred
to
the
secretary
of
state
has
designated
as
a
board
to
conduct
the
prescribed
examinations
the
third
assistant
secretary
of
state
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
state
and
the
chief
of
the
consular
bureau
and
has
specified
the
subjects
to
which
such
examinations
shall
relate
it
is
not
assumed
that
this
system
will
prove
a
full
measure
of
consular
reform
it
is
quite
probable
that
actual
experience
will
show
particulars
in
which
the
order
already
issued
may
be
amended
and
demonstrate
that
for
the
best
results
appropriate
legislation
by
congress
is
imperatively
required
in
any
event
these
efforts
to
improve
the
consular
service
ought
to
be
immediately
supplemented
by
legislation
providing
for
consular
inspection
this
has
frequently
been
a
subject
of
executive
recommendation
and
i
again
urge
such
action
by
congress
as
will
permit
the
frequent
and
thorough
inspection
of
consulates
by
officers
appointed
for
that
purpose
or
by
persons
already
in
the
diplomatic
or
consular
service
the
expense
attending
such
a
plan
would
be
insignificant
compared
with
its
usefulness
and
i
hope
the
legislation
necessary
to
set
it
on
foot
will
be
speedily
forthcoming
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
in
addition
to
their
salaries
our
ambassadors
and
ministers
at
foreign
courts
should
be
provided
by
the
government
with
official
residences
the
salaries
of
these
officers
are
comparatively
small
and
in
most
cases
insufficient
to
pay
with
other
necessary
expenses
the
cost
of
maintaining
household
establishments
in
keeping
with
their
important
and
delicate
functions
the
usefulness
of
a
nations
diplomatic
representative
undeniably
depends
much
upon
the
appropriateness
of
his
surroundings
and
a
country
like
ours
while
avoiding
unnecessary
glitter
and
show
should
be
certain
that
it
does
not
suffer
in
its
relations
with
foreign
nations
through
parsimony
and
shabbiness
in
its
diplomatic
outfit
these
considerations
and
the
other
advantages
of
having
fixed
and
somewhat
permanent
locations
for
our
embassies
would
abundantly
justify
the
moderate
expenditure
necessary
to
carry
out
this
suggestion
as
we
turn
from
a
review
of
our
foreign
relations
to
the
contemplation
of
our
national
financial
situation
we
are
immediately
aware
that
we
approach
a
subject
of
domestic
concern
more
important
than
any
other
that
can
engage
our
attention
and
one
at
present
in
such
a
perplexing
and
delicate
predicament
as
to
require
prompt
and
wise
treatment
we
may
well
be
encouraged
to
earnest
effort
in
this
direction
when
we
recall
the
steps
already
taken
toward
improving
our
economic
and
financial
situation
and
when
we
appreciate
how
well
the
way
has
been
prepared
for
further
progress
by
an
aroused
and
intelligent
popular
interest
in
these
subjects
by
command
of
the
people
a
customsrevenue
system
designed
for
the
protection
and
benefit
of
favored
classes
at
the
expense
of
the
great
mass
of
our
countrymen
and
which
while
inefficient
for
the
purpose
of
revenue
curtailed
our
trade
relations
and
impeded
our
entrance
to
the
markets
of
the
world
has
been
superseded
by
a
tariff
policy
which
in
principle
is
based
upon
a
denial
of
the
right
of
the
government
to
obstruct
the
avenues
to
our
peoples
cheap
living
or
lessen
their
comfort
and
contentment
for
the
sake
of
according
especial
advantages
to
favorites
and
which
while
encouraging
our
intercourse
and
trade
with
other
nations
recognizes
the
fact
that
american
selfreliance
thrift
and
ingenuity
can
build
up
our
countrys
industries
and
develop
its
resources
more
surely
than
enervating
paternalism
the
compulsory
purchase
and
coinage
of
silver
by
the
government
unchecked
and
unregulated
by
business
conditions
and
heedless
of
our
currency
needs
which
for
more
than
fifteen
years
diluted
our
circulating
medium
undermined
confidence
abroad
in
our
financial
ability
and
at
last
culminated
in
distress
and
panic
at
home
has
been
recently
stopped
by
the
repeal
of
the
laws
which
forced
this
reckless
scheme
upon
the
country
the
things
thus
accomplished
notwithstanding
their
extreme
importance
and
beneficent
effects
fall
far
short
of
curing
the
monetary
evils
from
which
we
suffer
as
a
result
of
long
indulgence
in
illadvised
financial
expedients
the
currency
denominated
united
states
notes
and
commonly
known
as
greenbacks
was
issued
in
large
volume
during
the
late
civil
war
and
was
intended
originally
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
that
period
it
will
be
seen
by
a
reference
to
the
debates
in
congress
at
the
time
the
laws
were
passed
authorizing
the
issue
of
these
notes
that
their
advocates
declared
they
were
intended
for
only
temporary
use
and
to
meet
the
emergency
of
war
in
almost
if
not
all
the
laws
relating
to
them
some
provision
was
made
contemplating
their
voluntary
or
compulsory
retirement
a
large
quantity
of
them
however
were
kept
on
foot
and
mingled
with
the
currency
of
the
country
so
that
at
the
close
of
the
year
they
amounted
to
immediately
after
that
date
and
in
january
a
law
was
passed
providing
for
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
by
which
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
required
whenever
additional
circulation
was
issued
to
national
banks
to
retire
united
states
notes
equal
in
amount
to
per
cent
of
such
additional
nationalbank
circulation
until
such
notes
were
reduced
to
this
law
further
provided
that
on
and
after
the
st
day
of
january
the
united
states
notes
then
outstanding
should
be
redeemed
in
coin
and
in
order
to
provide
and
prepare
for
such
redemption
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
authorized
not
only
to
use
any
surplus
revenues
of
the
government
but
to
issue
bonds
of
the
united
states
and
dispose
of
them
for
coin
and
to
use
the
proceeds
for
the
purposes
contemplated
by
the
statute
in
may
and
before
the
date
thus
appointed
for
the
redemption
and
retirement
of
these
notes
another
statute
was
passed
forbidding
their
further
cancellation
and
retirement
some
of
them
had
however
been
previously
redeemed
and
canceled
upon
the
issue
of
additional
nationalbank
circulation
as
permitted
by
the
law
of
so
that
the
amount
outstanding
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act
forbidding
their
further
retirement
was
the
law
of
did
not
stop
at
distinct
prohibition
but
contained
in
addition
the
following
express
provision
and
when
any
of
said
notes
may
be
redeemed
or
be
received
into
the
treasury
under
any
law
from
any
source
whatever
and
shall
belong
to
the
united
states
they
shall
not
be
retired
canceled
or
destroyed
but
they
shall
be
reissued
and
paid
out
again
and
kept
in
circulation
this
was
the
condition
of
affairs
on
the
st
day
of
january
which
had
been
fixed
upon
four
years
before
as
the
date
for
entering
upon
the
redemption
and
retirement
of
all
these
notes
and
for
which
such
abundant
means
had
been
provided
the
government
was
put
in
the
anomalous
situation
of
owing
to
the
holders
of
its
notes
debts
payable
in
gold
on
demand
which
could
neither
be
retired
by
receiving
such
notes
in
discharge
of
obligations
due
the
government
nor
canceled
by
actual
payment
in
gold
it
was
forced
to
redeem
without
redemption
and
to
pay
without
acquittance
there
had
been
issued
and
sold
of
the
bonds
authorized
by
the
resumption
act
of
the
proceeds
of
which
together
with
other
gold
in
the
treasury
created
a
gold
fund
deemed
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
which
might
be
made
upon
it
for
the
redemption
of
the
outstanding
united
states
notes
this
fund
together
with
such
other
gold
as
might
be
from
time
to
time
in
the
treasury
available
for
the
same
purpose
has
been
since
called
our
gold
reserve
and
has
been
regarded
as
an
adequate
amount
to
accomplish
its
object
this
fund
amounted
on
the
st
day
of
january
to
and
though
thereafter
constantly
fluctuating
it
did
not
fall
below
that
sum
until
july
in
april
for
the
first
time
since
its
establishment
this
reserve
amounted
to
less
than
containing
at
that
date
only
in
the
meantime
and
in
july
an
act
had
been
passed
directing
larger
governmental
monthly
purchases
of
silver
than
had
been
required
under
previous
laws
and
providing
that
in
payment
for
such
silver
treasury
notes
of
the
united
states
should
be
issue
d
payable
on
demand
in
gold
or
silver
coin
at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
was
however
declared
in
the
act
to
be
the
established
policy
of
the
united
states
to
maintain
the
two
metals
on
a
parity
with
each
other
upon
the
present
legal
ratio
or
such
ratio
as
may
be
provided
by
law
in
view
of
this
declaration
it
was
not
deemed
permissible
for
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
exercise
the
discretion
in
terms
conferred
on
him
by
refusing
to
pay
gold
on
these
notes
when
demanded
because
by
such
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
gold
dollar
the
socalled
parity
of
the
two
metals
would
be
destroyed
and
grave
and
dangerous
consequences
would
be
precipitated
by
affirming
or
accentuating
the
constantly
widening
disparity
between
their
actual
values
under
the
existing
ratio
it
thus
resulted
that
the
treasury
notes
issued
in
payment
of
silver
purchases
under
the
law
of
were
necessarily
treated
as
gold
obligations
at
the
option
of
the
holder
these
notes
on
the
st
day
of
november
when
the
law
compelling
the
monthly
purchase
of
silver
was
repealed
amounted
to
more
than
the
notes
of
this
description
now
outstanding
added
to
the
united
states
notes
still
undiminished
by
redemption
or
cancellation
constitute
a
volume
of
gold
obligations
amounting
to
nearly
these
obligations
are
the
instruments
which
ever
since
we
had
a
gold
reserve
have
been
used
to
deplete
it
this
reserve
as
has
been
stated
had
fallen
in
april
to
it
has
from
that
time
to
the
present
with
very
few
and
unimportant
upward
movements
steadily
decreased
except
as
it
has
been
temporarily
replenished
by
the
sale
of
bonds
among
the
causes
for
this
constant
and
uniform
shrinkage
in
this
fund
may
be
mentioned
the
great
falling
off
of
exports
under
the
operation
of
the
tariff
law
until
recently
in
force
which
crippled
our
exchange
of
commodities
with
foreign
nations
and
necessitated
to
some
extent
the
payment
of
our
balances
in
gold
the
unnatural
infusion
of
silver
into
our
currency
and
the
increasing
agitation
for
its
free
and
unlimited
coinage
which
have
created
apprehension
as
to
our
disposition
or
ability
to
continue
gold
payments
the
consequent
hoarding
of
gold
at
home
and
the
stoppage
of
investments
of
foreign
capital
as
well
as
the
return
of
our
securities
already
sold
abroad
and
the
high
rate
of
foreign
exchange
which
induced
the
shipment
of
our
gold
to
be
drawn
against
as
a
matter
of
speculation
in
consequence
of
these
conditions
the
gold
reserve
on
the
st
day
of
february
was
reduced
to
having
lost
more
than
during
the
preceding
nine
months
or
since
april
its
replenishment
being
necessary
and
no
other
manner
of
accomplishing
it
being
possible
resort
was
had
to
the
issue
and
sale
of
bonds
provided
for
by
the
resumption
act
of
fifty
millions
of
these
bonds
were
sold
yielding
which
was
added
to
the
reserve
fund
of
gold
then
on
hand
as
a
result
of
this
operation
this
reserve
which
had
suffered
constant
and
large
withdrawals
in
the
meantime
stood
on
the
th
day
of
march
at
the
sum
of
its
depletion
was
however
immediately
thereafter
so
accelerated
that
on
the
th
day
of
june
it
had
fallen
to
thus
losing
by
withdrawals
more
than
in
five
months
and
dropping
slightly
below
its
situation
when
the
sale
of
in
bonds
was
effected
for
its
replenishment
this
depressed
condition
grew
worse
and
on
the
th
day
of
november
our
gold
reserve
being
reduced
to
it
became
necessary
to
again
strengthen
it
this
was
done
by
another
sale
of
bonds
amounting
to
from
which
there
was
realized
with
which
the
fund
was
increased
to
on
the
th
day
of
december
again
disappointment
awaited
the
anxious
hope
for
relief
there
was
not
even
a
lull
in
the
exasperating
withdrawals
of
gold
on
the
contrary
they
grew
larger
and
more
persistent
than
ever
between
the
th
day
of
december
and
early
in
february
a
period
of
scarcely
more
than
two
months
after
the
second
reenforcement
of
our
gold
reserve
by
the
sale
of
bonds
it
had
lost
by
such
withdrawals
more
than
and
had
fallen
to
nearly
had
been
withdrawn
within
the
month
immediately
preceding
this
situation
in
anticipation
of
impending
trouble
i
had
on
the
th
day
of
january
addressed
a
communication
to
the
congress
fully
setting
forth
our
difficulties
and
dangerous
position
and
earnestly
recommending
that
authority
be
given
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
issue
bonds
bearing
a
low
rate
of
interest
payable
by
their
terms
in
gold
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
a
sufficient
gold
reserve
and
also
for
the
redemption
and
cancellation
of
outstanding
united
states
notes
and
the
treasury
notes
issued
for
the
purchase
of
silver
under
the
law
of
this
recommendation
did
not
however
meet
with
legislative
approval
in
february
therefore
the
situation
was
exceedingly
critical
with
a
reserve
perilously
low
and
a
refusal
of
congressional
aid
everything
indicated
that
the
end
of
gold
payments
by
the
government
was
imminent
the
results
of
prior
bond
issues
had
been
exceedingly
unsatisfactory
and
the
large
withdrawals
of
gold
immediately
succeeding
their
public
sale
in
open
market
gave
rise
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
large
part
of
the
gold
paid
into
the
treasury
upon
such
sales
was
promptly
drawn
out
again
by
the
presentation
of
united
states
notes
or
treasury
notes
and
found
its
way
to
the
hands
of
those
who
had
only
temporarily
parted
with
it
in
the
purchase
of
bonds
in
this
emergency
and
in
view
of
its
surrounding
perplexities
it
became
entirely
apparent
to
those
upon
whom
the
struggle
for
safety
was
devolved
not
only
that
our
gold
reserve
must
for
the
third
time
in
less
than
thirteen
months
be
restored
by
another
issue
and
sale
of
bonds
bearing
a
high
rate
of
interest
and
badly
suited
to
the
purpose
but
that
a
plan
must
be
adopted
for
their
disposition
promising
better
results
than
those
realized
on
previous
sales
an
agreement
was
therefore
made
with
a
number
of
financiers
and
bankers
whereby
it
was
stipulated
that
bonds
described
in
the
resumption
act
of
payable
in
coin
thirty
years
after
their
date
bearing
interest
at
the
rate
of
pet
cent
per
annum
and
amounting
to
about
should
be
exchanged
for
gold
receivable
by
weight
amounting
to
a
little
more
than
this
gold
was
to
be
delivered
in
such
installments
as
would
complete
its
delivery
within
about
six
months
from
the
date
of
the
contract
and
at
least
onehalf
of
the
amount
was
to
be
furnished
from
abroad
it
was
also
agreed
by
those
supplying
this
gold
that
during
the
continuance
of
the
contract
they
would
by
every
means
in
their
power
protect
the
government
against
gold
withdrawals
the
contract
also
provided
that
if
congress
would
authorize
their
issue
bonds
payable
by
their
terms
in
gold
and
bearing
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
per
annum
might
within
ten
days
be
substituted
at
par
for
the
per
cent
bonds
described
in
the
agreement
on
the
day
this
contract
was
made
its
terms
were
communicated
to
congress
by
a
special
executive
message
in
which
it
was
stated
that
more
than
would
be
saved
to
the
government
if
gold
bonds
bearing
per
cent
interest
were
authorized
to
be
substituted
for
those
mentioned
in
the
contract
the
congress
having
declined
to
grant
the
necessary
authority
to
secure
this
saving
the
contract
unmodified
was
carried
out
resulting
in
a
gold
reserve
amounting
to
on
the
th
day
of
july
the
performance
of
this
contract
not
only
restored
the
reserve
but
checked
for
a
time
the
withdrawals
of
gold
and
brought
on
a
period
of
restored
confidence
and
such
peace
and
quiet
in
business
circles
as
were
of
the
greatest
possible
value
to
every
interest
that
affects
our
people
i
have
never
had
the
slightest
misgiving
concerning
the
wisdom
or
propriety
of
this
arrangement
and
am
quite
willing
to
answer
for
my
full
share
of
responsibility
for
its
promotion
i
believe
it
averted
a
disaster
the
imminence
of
which
was
fortunately
not
at
the
time
generally
understood
by
our
people
though
the
contract
mentioned
stayed
for
a
time
the
tide
of
gold
withdrawal
its
good
results
could
not
be
permanent
recent
withdrawals
have
reduced
the
reserve
from
on
the
th
day
of
july
to
how
long
it
will
remain
large
enough
to
render
its
increase
unnecessary
is
only
matter
of
conjecture
though
quite
large
withdrawals
for
shipment
in
the
immediate
future
are
predicted
in
wellinformed
quarters
about
has
been
withdrawn
during
the
month
of
november
the
foregoing
statement
of
events
and
conditions
develops
the
fact
that
after
increasing
our
interestbearing
bonded
indebtedness
more
than
to
save
our
gold
reserve
we
are
nearly
where
we
started
having
now
in
such
reserve
as
against
in
february
when
the
first
bonds
were
issued
though
the
amount
of
gold
drawn
from
the
treasury
appears
to
be
very
large
as
gathered
from
the
facts
and
figures
herein
presented
it
actually
was
much
larger
considerable
sums
having
been
acquired
by
the
treasury
within
the
several
periods
stated
without
the
issue
of
bonds
on
the
th
of
january
it
was
reported
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
more
than
of
gold
had
been
withdrawn
for
hoarding
or
shipment
during
the
year
preceding
he
now
reports
that
from
january
to
july
a
period
of
more
than
eleven
years
only
a
little
over
was
withdrawn
and
that
between
july
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
law
for
an
increased
purchase
of
silver
and
the
st
day
of
december
or
within
less
than
five
and
a
half
years
there
was
withdrawn
nearly
making
a
total
of
more
than
drawn
from
the
treasury
in
gold
since
january
the
date
fixed
in
for
the
retirement
of
the
united
states
notes
nearly
of
the
gold
thus
withdrawn
has
been
paid
out
on
these
united
states
notes
and
yet
every
one
of
the
is
still
uncanceled
and
ready
to
do
service
in
future
gold
depletions
more
than
in
gold
has
since
their
creation
in
been
paid
out
from
the
treasury
upon
the
notes
given
on
the
purchase
of
silver
by
the
government
and
yet
the
whole
amounting
to
except
a
little
more
than
which
has
been
retired
by
exchanges
for
silver
at
the
request
of
the
holders
remains
outstanding
and
prepared
to
join
their
older
and
more
experienced
allies
in
future
raids
upon
the
treasurys
gold
re
serve
in
other
words
the
government
has
paid
in
gold
more
than
ninetenths
of
its
united
states
notes
and
still
owes
them
all
it
has
paid
in
gold
about
onehalf
of
its
notes
given
for
silver
purchases
without
extinguishing
by
such
payment
one
dollar
of
these
notes
when
added
to
all
this
we
are
reminded
that
to
carry
on
this
astound
lug
financial
scheme
the
government
has
incurred
a
bonded
indebtedness
of
in
establishing
a
gold
reserve
and
of
in
efforts
to
maintain
it
that
the
annual
interest
charge
on
such
bonded
indebtedness
is
more
than
that
a
continuance
of
our
present
course
may
result
in
further
bond
issues
and
that
we
have
suffered
or
are
threatened
with
all
this
for
the
sake
of
supplying
gold
for
foreign
shipment
or
facilitating
its
hoarding
at
home
a
situation
is
exhibited
which
certainly
ought
to
arrest
attention
and
provoke
immediate
legislative
relief
i
am
convinced
the
only
thorough
and
practicable
remedy
for
our
troubles
is
found
in
the
retirement
and
cancellation
of
our
united
states
notes
commonly
called
greenbacks
and
the
outstanding
treasury
notes
issued
by
the
government
in
payment
of
silver
purchases
under
the
act
of
i
believe
this
could
be
quite
readily
accomplished
by
the
exchange
of
these
notes
for
united
states
bonds
of
small
as
well
as
large
denominations
bearing
a
low
rate
of
interest
they
should
be
longterm
bonds
thus
increasing
their
desirability
as
investments
and
because
their
payment
could
be
well
postponed
to
a
period
far
removed
from
present
financial
burdens
and
perplexities
when
with
increased
prosperity
and
resources
they
would
be
more
easily
met
to
further
insure
the
cancellation
of
these
notes
and
also
provide
a
way
by
which
gold
may
be
added
to
our
currency
in
lieu
of
them
a
feature
in
the
plan
should
be
an
authority
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
dispose
of
the
bonds
abroad
for
gold
if
necessary
to
complete
the
contemplated
redemption
and
cancellation
permitting
him
to
use
the
proceeds
of
such
bonds
to
take
up
and
cancel
any
of
the
notes
that
may
be
in
the
treasury
or
that
may
be
received
by
the
government
on
any
account
the
increase
of
our
bonded
debt
involved
in
this
plan
would
be
amply
compensated
by
renewed
activity
and
enterprise
in
all
business
circles
the
restored
confidence
at
home
the
reinstated
faith
in
our
monetary
strength
abroad
and
the
stimulation
of
every
interest
and
industry
that
would
follow
the
cancellation
of
the
golddemand
obligations
now
afflicting
us
in
any
event
the
bonds
proposed
would
stand
for
the
extinguishment
of
a
troublesome
indebtedness
while
in
the
path
we
now
follow
there
lurks
the
menace
of
unending
bonds
with
our
indebtedness
still
undischarged
and
aggravated
in
every
feature
the
obligations
necessary
to
fund
this
indebtedness
would
not
equal
in
amount
those
from
which
we
have
been
relieved
since
by
anticipation
and
payment
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
sinking
fund
out
of
our
surplus
revenues
the
currency
withdrawn
by
the
retirement
of
the
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
amounting
to
probably
less
than
might
be
supplied
by
such
gold
as
would
be
used
on
their
retirement
or
by
an
increase
in
the
circulation
of
our
national
banks
though
the
aggregate
capital
of
those
now
in
existence
amounts
to
more
than
their
outstanding
circulation
based
on
bond
security
amounts
to
only
about
they
are
authorized
to
issue
notes
amounting
to
per
cent
of
the
bonds
deposited
to
secure
their
circulation
but
in
no
event
beyond
the
amount
of
their
capital
stock
and
they
are
obliged
to
pay
per
cent
tax
on
the
circulation
they
issue
i
think
they
should
be
allowed
to
issue
circulation
equal
to
the
par
value
of
the
bonds
they
deposit
to
secure
it
and
that
the
tax
on
their
circulation
should
be
reduced
to
onefourth
of
per
cent
which
would
undoubtedly
meet
all
the
expense
the
government
incurs
on
their
account
in
addition
they
should
be
allowed
to
substitute
or
deposit
in
lieu
of
the
bonds
now
required
as
security
for
their
circulation
those
which
would
be
issued
for
the
purpose
of
retiring
the
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
the
banks
already
existing
if
they
desired
to
avail
themselves
of
the
provisions
of
law
thus
modified
could
issue
circulation
in
addition
to
that
already
outstanding
amounting
to
which
would
nearly
or
quite
equal
the
currency
proposed
to
be
canceled
at
any
rate
i
should
confidently
expect
to
see
the
existing
national
banks
or
others
to
be
organized
avail
themselves
of
the
proposed
encouragements
to
issue
circulation
and
promptly
fill
any
vacuum
and
supply
every
currency
need
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
provisions
of
law
regarding
the
capital
of
national
banks
which
operate
as
a
limitation
to
their
location
fail
to
make
proper
compensation
for
the
suppression
of
state
banks
which
came
near
to
the
people
in
all
sections
of
the
country
and
readily
furnished
them
with
banking
accommodations
and
facilities
any
inconvenience
or
embarrassment
arising
from
these
restrictions
on
the
location
of
national
banks
might
well
be
remedied
by
better
adapting
the
present
system
to
the
creation
of
banks
in
smaller
communities
or
by
permitting
banks
of
large
capital
to
establish
branches
in
such
localities
as
would
serve
the
people
so
regulated
and
restrained
as
to
secure
their
safe
and
conservative
control
and
management
but
there
might
not
be
the
necessity
for
such
an
addition
to
the
currency
by
new
issues
of
bank
circulation
as
at
first
glance
is
indicated
if
we
should
be
relieved
from
maintaining
a
gold
reserve
under
conditions
that
constitute
it
the
barometer
of
our
solvency
and
if
our
treasury
should
no
longer
be
the
foolish
purveyor
of
gold
for
nations
abroad
or
for
speculation
and
hoarding
by
our
citizens
at
home
i
should
expect
to
see
gold
resume
its
natural
and
normal
functions
in
the
business
affairs
of
the
country
and
cease
to
be
an
object
attracting
the
timid
watch
of
our
people
and
exciting
their
sensitive
imaginations
i
do
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
cancellation
of
the
treasury
notes
issued
under
the
silverpurchasing
act
of
would
leave
the
treasury
in
the
actual
ownership
of
sufficient
silver
including
seigniorage
to
coin
nearly
in
standard
dollars
it
is
worthy
of
consideration
whether
this
might
not
from
time
to
time
be
converted
into
dollars
or
fractional
coin
and
slowly
put
into
circulation
as
in
the
judgment
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
necessities
of
the
country
should
require
whatever
is
attempted
should
be
entered
upon
fully
appreciating
the
fact
that
by
careless
easy
descent
we
have
reached
a
dangerous
depth
and
that
our
ascent
will
not
be
accomplished
without
laborious
toil
and
struggle
we
shall
be
wise
if
we
realize
that
we
are
financially
ill
and
that
our
restoration
to
health
may
require
heroic
treatment
and
unpleasant
remedies
in
the
present
stage
of
our
difficulty
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
how
the
amount
of
our
revenue
receipts
directly
affects
it
the
important
question
is
not
the
quantity
of
money
received
in
revenue
payments
but
the
kind
of
money
we
maintain
and
our
ability
to
continue
in
sound
financial
condition
we
are
considering
the
governments
holdings
of
gold
as
related
to
the
soundness
of
our
money
and
as
affecting
our
national
credit
and
monetary
strength
if
our
gold
reserve
had
never
been
impaired
if
no
bonds
had
ever
been
issued
to
replenish
it
if
there
had
been
no
fear
and
timidity
concerning
our
ability
to
continue
gold
payments
if
any
part
of
our
revenues
were
now
paid
in
gold
and
if
we
could
look
to
our
gold
receipts
as
a
means
of
maintaining
a
safe
reserve
the
amount
of
our
revenues
would
be
an
influential
factor
in
the
problem
but
unfortunately
all
the
circumstances
that
might
lend
weight
to
this
consideration
are
entirely
lacking
in
our
present
predicament
no
gold
is
received
by
the
government
in
payment
of
revenue
charges
nor
would
there
be
if
the
revenues
were
increased
the
receipts
of
the
treasury
when
not
in
silver
certificates
consist
of
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
issued
for
silver
purchases
these
forms
of
money
are
only
useful
to
the
government
in
paying
its
current
ordinary
expenses
and
its
quantity
in
government
possession
does
not
in
the
least
contribute
toward
giving
us
that
kind
of
safe
financial
standing
or
condition
which
is
built
on
gold
alone
if
it
is
said
that
these
notes
if
held
by
the
government
can
be
used
to
obtain
gold
for
our
reserve
the
answer
is
easy
the
people
draw
gold
from
the
treasury
on
demand
upon
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
but
the
proposition
that
the
treasury
can
on
demand
draw
gold
from
the
people
upon
them
would
be
regarded
in
these
days
with
wonder
and
amusement
and
even
if
this
could
be
done
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
those
thus
parting
with
their
gold
from
regaining
it
the
next
day
or
the
next
hour
by
the
presentation
of
the
notes
they
received
in
exchange
for
it
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
might
use
such
notes
taken
from
a
surplus
revenue
to
buy
gold
in
the
market
of
course
he
could
not
do
this
without
paying
a
premium
private
holders
of
gold
unlike
the
government
having
no
parity
to
maintain
would
not
be
restrained
from
making
the
best
bargain
possible
when
they
furnished
gold
to
the
treasury
but
the
moment
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
bought
gold
on
any
terms
above
par
he
would
establish
a
general
and
universal
premium
upon
it
thus
breaking
down
the
parity
between
gold
and
silver
which
the
government
is
pledged
to
maintain
and
opening
the
way
to
new
and
serious
complications
in
the
meantime
the
premium
would
not
remain
stationary
and
the
absurd
spectacle
might
be
presented
of
a
dealer
selling
gold
to
the
government
and
with
united
states
notes
or
treasury
notes
in
his
hand
immediately
clamoring
for
its
return
and
a
resale
at
a
higher
premium
it
may
be
claimed
that
a
large
revenue
and
redundant
receipts
might
favorably
affect
the
situation
under
discussion
by
affording
an
opportunity
of
retaining
these
notes
in
the
treasury
when
received
and
thus
preventing
their
presentation
for
gold
such
retention
to

be
useful
ought
to
be
at
least
measurably
permanent
and
this
is
precisely
what
is
prohibited
so
far
as
united
states
notes
are
concerned
by
the
law
of
forbidding
their
further
retirement
that
statute
in
so
many
words
provides
that
these
notes
when
received
into
the
treasury
and
belonging
to
the
united
states
shall
be
paid
out
again
and
kept
in
circulation
it
will
moreover
be
readily
seen
that
the
government
could
not
refuse
to
pay
out
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
in
current
transactions
when
demanded
and
insist
on
paying
out
silver
alone
and
still
maintain
the
parity
between
that
metal
and
the
currency
representing
gold
besides
the
accumulation
in
the
treasury
of
currency
of
any
kind
exacted
from
the
people
through
taxation
is
justly
regarded
as
an
evil
and
it
can
not
proceed
far
without
vigorous
protest
against
an
unjustifiable
retention
of
money
from
the
business
of
the
country
and
a
denunciation
of
a
scheme
of
taxation
which
proves
itself
to
be
unjust
when
it
takes
from
the
earnings
and
income
of
the
citizen
money
so
much
in
excess
of
the
needs
of
government
support
that
large
sums
can
be
gathered
and
kept
in
the
treasury
such
a
condition
has
heretofore
in
times
of
surplus
revenue
led
the
government
to
restore
currency
to
the
people
by
the
purchase
of
its
unmatured
bonds
at
a
large
premium
and
by
a
large
increase
of
its
deposits
in
national
banks
and
we
easily
remember
that
the
abuse
of
treasury
accumulation
has
furnished
a
most
persuasive
argument
in
favor
of
legislation
radically
reducing
our
tariff
taxation
perhaps
it
is
supposed
that
sufficient
revenue
receipts
would
in
a
sentimental
way
improve
the
situation
by
inspiring
confidence
in
our
solvency
and
allaying
the
fear
of
pecuniary
exhaustion
and
yet
through
all
our
struggles
to
maintain
our
gold
reserve
there
never
has
been
any
apprehension
as
to
our
ready
ability
to
pay
our
way
with
such
money
as
we
had
and
the
question
whether
or
not
our
current
receipts
met
our
current
expenses
has
not
entered
into
the
estimate
of
our
solvency
of
course
the
general
state
of
our
funds
exclusive
of
gold
was
entirely
immaterial
to
the
foreign
creditor
and
investor
his
debt
could
only
be
paid
in
gold
and
his
only
concern
was
our
ability
to
keep
on
hand
that
kind
of
money
on
july
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
first
bonds
were
issued
to
replenish
the
gold
reserve
there
was
a
net
balance
in
the
treasury
exclusive
of
such
reserve
of
less
than
but
the
gold
reserve
amounted
to
more
than
which
was
the
quieting
feature
of
the
situation
it
was
when
the
stock
of
gold
began
rapidly
to
fall
that
fright
supervened
and
our
securities
held
abroad
were
returned
for
sale
and
debts
owed
abroad
were
pressed
for
payment
in
the
meantime
extensive
shipments
of
gold
and
other
unfavorable
indications
caused
restlessness
and
fright
among
our
people
at
home
thereupon
the
general
state
of
our
funds
exclusive
of
gold
became
also
immaterial
to
them
and
they
too
drew
gold
from
the
treasury
for
hoarding
against
all
contingencies
this
is
plainly
shown
by
the
large
increase
in
the
proportion
of
gold
withdrawn
which
was
retained
by
our
own
people
as
time
and
threatening
incidents
progressed
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
nearly
in
gold
was
withdrawn
from
the
treasury
and
about
was
sent
abroad
while
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
over
was
drawn
out
of
which
only
about
was
shipped
leaving
the
large
balance
of
such
withdrawals
to
be
accounted
for
by
domestic
hoarding
inasmuch
as
the
withdrawal
of
our
gold
has
resulted
largely
from
fright
there
is
nothing
apparent
that
will
prevent
its
continuance
or
recurrence
with
its
natural
consequences
except
such
a
change
in
our
financial
methods
as
will
reassure
the
frightened
and
make
the
desire
for
gold
less
intense
it
is
not
clear
how
an
increase
fix
revenue
unless
it
be
in
gold
can
satisfy
those
whose
only
anxiety
is
to
gain
gold
from
the
governments
store
it
can
not
therefore
be
safe
to
rely
upon
increased
revenues
as
a
cure
for
our
present
troubles
it
is
possible
that
the
suggestion
of
increased
revenue
as
a
remedy
for
the
difficulties
we
are
considering
may
have
originated
in
an
intimation
or
distinct
allegation
that
the
bonds
which
have
been
issued
ostensibly
to
replenish
our
gold
reserve
were
really
issued
to
supply
insufficient
revenue
nothing
can
be
further
from
the
truth
bonds
were
issued
to
obtain
gold
for
the
maintenance
of
our
national
credit
as
has
been
shown
the
gold
thus
obtained
has
been
drawn
again
from
the
treasury
upon
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
this
operation
would
have
been
promptly
prevented
if
possible
but
these
notes
having
thus
been
passed
to
the
treasury
they
became
the
money
of
the
government
like
any
other
ordinary
government
funds
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
use
them
in
paying
government
expenses
when
needed
at
no
time
when
bonds
have
been
issued
has
there
been
any
consideration
of
the
question
of
paying
the
expenses
of
government
with
their
proceeds
there
was
no
necessity
to
consider
that
question
at
the
time
of
each
bond
issue
we
had
a
safe
surplus
in
the
treasury
for
ordinary
operations
exclusive
of
the
gold
in
our
reserve
in
february
when
the
first
issue
of
bonds
was
made
such
surplus
amounted
to
over
in
november
when
the
second
issue
was
made
it
amounted
to
more
than
and
in
february
when
bonds
for
the
third
time
were
issued
such
surplus
amounted
to
more
than
it
now
amounts
to
besides
all
this
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
no
authority
whatever
to
issue
bonds
to
increase
the
ordinary
revenues
or
pay
current
expenses
i
can
not
but
think
there
has
been
some
confusion
of
ideas
regarding
the
effects
of
the
issue
of
bonds
and
the
results
of
the
withdrawal
of
gold
it
was
the
latter
process
and
not
the
former
that
by
substituting
in
the
treasury
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
for
gold
increased
by
their
amount
the
money
which
was
in
the
first
instance
subject
to
ordinary
government
expenditure
although
the
law
compelling
an
increased
purchase
of
silver
by
the
government
was
passed
on
the
th
day
of
july
withdrawals
of
gold
from
the
treasury
upon
the
notes
given
in
payment
on
such
purchases
did
not
begin
until
october
immediately
following
that
date
the
withdrawals
upon
both
these
notes
and
united
states
notes
increased
very
largely
and
have
continued
to
such
an
extent
that
since
the
passage
of
that
law
there
has
been
more
than
thirteen
times
as
much
gold
taken
out
of
the
treasury
upon
united
states
notes
and
treasury
notes
issued
for
silver
purchases
as
was
thus
withdrawn
during
the
eleven
and
a
half
years
immediately
prior
thereto
and
after
the
st
day
of
january
when
specie
payments
were
resumed
it
is
neither
unfair
nor
unjust
to
charge
a
large
share
of
our
present
financial
perplexities
and
dangers
to
the
operation
of
the
laws
of
and
compelling
the
purchase
of
silver
by
the
government
which
not
only
furnished
a
new
treasury
obligation
upon
which
its
gold
could
be
withdrawn
but
so
increased
the
fear
of
an
overwhelming
flood
of
silver
and
a
forced
descent
to
silver
payments
that
even
the
repeal
of
these
laws
did
not
entirely
cure
the
evils
of
their
existence
while
i
have
endeavored
to
make
a
plain
statement
of
the
disordered
condition
of
our
currency
and
the
present
dangers
menacing
our
prosperity
and
to
suggest
a
way
which
leads
to
a
safer
financial
system
i
have
constantly
had
in
mind
the
fact
that
many
of
my
countrymen
whose
sincerity
i
do
not
doubt
insist
that
the
cure
for
the
ills
now
threatening
us
may
be
found
in
the
single
and
simple
remedy
of
the
free
coinage
of
silver
they
contend
that
our
mints
shall
be
at
once
thrown
open
to
the
free
unlimited
and
independent
coinage
of
both
gold
and
silver
dollars
of
full
legaltender
quality
regardless
of
the
action
of
any
other
government
and
in
full
view
of
the
fact
that
the
ratio
between
the
metals
which
they
suggest
calls
for
cents
worth
of
gold
in
the
gold
dollar
at
the
present
standard
and
only
cents
in
intrinsic
worth
of
silver
in
the
silver
dollar
were
there
infinitely
stronger
reasons
than
can
be
adduced
for
hoping
that
such
action
would
secure
for
us
a
bimetallic
currency
moving
on
lines
of
parity
an
experiment
so
novel
and
hazardous
as
that
proposed
might
well
stagger
those
who
believe
that
stability
is
an
imperative
condition
of
sound
money
no
government
no
human
contrivance
or
act
of
legislation
has
ever
been
able
to
hold
the
two
metals
together
in
free
coinage
at
a
ratio
appreciably
different
from
that
which
is
established
in
the
markets
of
the
world
those
who
believe
that
our
independent
free
coinage
of
silver
at
an
artificial
ratio
with
gold
of
to
would
restore
the
parity
between
the
metals
and
consequently
between
the
coins
oppose
an
unsupported
and
improbable
theory
to
the
general
belief
and
practice
of
other
nations
and
to
the
teaching
of
the
wisest
statesmen
and
economists
of
the
world
both
in
the
past
and
present
and
what
is
far
more
conclusive
they
run
counter
to
our
own
actual
experiences
twice
in
our
earlier
history
our
lawmakers
in
attempting
to
establish
a
bimetallic
currency
undertook
free
coinage
upon
a
ratio
which
accidentally
varied
from
the
actual
relative
values
of
the
two
metals
not
more
than
per
cent
in
both
cases
notwithstanding
greater
difficulties
and
cost
of
transportation
than
now
exist
the
coins
whose
intrinsic
worth
was
undervalued
in
the
ratio
gradually
and
surely
disappeared
from
our
circulation
and
went
to
other
countries
where
their
real
value
was
better
recognized
acts
of
congress
were
impotent
to
create
equality
where
natural
causes
decreed
even
a
slight
inequality
twice
in
our
recent
history
we
have
signally
failed
to
raise
by
legislation
the
value
of
silver
under
an
act
of
congress
passed
in
the
government
was
required
for
more
than
twelve
years
to
expend
annually
at
least
in
the
purchase
of
silver
bullion
for
coinage
the
act
of
july
in
a
still
bolder
effort
increased
the
amount
of
silver
the
government
was
compelled
to
purchase
and
forced
it
to
become
the
buyer
annually
of
ounces
or
p
ractically
the
entire
product
of
our
mines
under
both
laws
silver
rapidly
and
steadily
declined
in
value
the
prophecy
and
the
expressed
hope
and
expectation
of
those
in
the
congress
who
led
in
the
passage
of
the
lastmentioned
act
that
it
would
reestablish
and
maintain
the
former
parity
between
the
two
metals
are
still
fresh
in
our
memory
in
the
light
of
these
experiences
which
accord
with
the
experiences
of
other
nations
there
is
certainly
no
secure
ground
for
the
belief
that
an
act
of
congress
could
now
bridge
an
inequality
of
per
cent
between
gold
and
silver
at
our
present
ratio
nor
is
there
the
least
possibility
that
our
country
which
has
less
than
oneseventh
of
the
silver
money
in
the
world
could
by
its
action
alone
raise
not
only
our
own
but
all
silver
to
its
lost
ratio
with
gold
our
attempt
to
accomplish
this
by
the
free
coinage
of
silver
at
a
ratio
differing
widely
from
actual
relative
values
would
be
the
signal
for
the
complete
departure
of
gold
from
our
circulation
the
immediate
and
large
contraction
of
our
circulating
medium
and
a
shrinkage
in
the
real
value
and
monetary
efficiency
of
all
other
forms
of
currency
as
they
settled
to
the
level
of
silver
monometallism
everyone
who
receives
a
fixed
salary
and
every
worker
for
wages
would
find
the
dollar
in
his
hand
ruthlessly
scaled
down
to
the
point
of
bitter
disappointment
if
not
to
pinching
privation
a
change
in
our
standard
to
silver
monometallism
would
also
bring
on
a
collapse
of
the
entire
system
of
credit
which
when
based
on
a
standard
which
is
recognized
and
adopted
by
the
world
of
business
is
many
times
more
potent
and
useful
than
the
entire
volume
of
currency
and
is
safely
capable
of
almost
indefinite
expansion
to
meet
the
growth
of
trade
and
enterprise
in
a
selfinvited
struggle
through
darkness
and
uncertainty
our
humiliation
would
be
increased
by
the
consciousness
that
we
had
parted
company
with
all
the
enlightened
and
progressive
nations
of
the
world
and
were
desperately
and
hopelessly
striving
to
meet
the
stress
of
modern
commerce
and
competition
with
a
debased
and
unsuitable
currency
and
in
association
with
the
few
weak
and
laggard
nations
which
have
silver
alone
as
their
standard
of
value
all
history
warns
us
against
rash
experiments
which
threaten
violent
changes
in
our
monetary
standard
and
the
degradation
of
our
currency
the
past
is
full
of
lessons
teaching
not
only
the
economic
dangers
but
the
national
immorality
that
follow
in
the
train
of
such
experiments
i
will
not
believe
that
the
american
people
can
be
persuaded
after
sober
deliberation
to
jeopardize
their
nations
prestige
and
proud
standing
by
encouraging
financial
nostrums
nor
that
they
will
yield
to
the
false
allurements
of
cheap
money
when
they
realize
that
it
must
result
in
the
weakening
of
that
financial
integrity
and
rectitude
which
thus
far
in
our
history
has
been
so
devotedly
cherished
as
one
of
the
traits
of
true
americanism
our
countrys
indebtedness
whether
owing
by
the
government
or
existing
between
individuals
has
been
contracted
with
reference
to
our
present
standard
to
decree
by
act
of
congress
that
these
debts
shall
be
payable
in
less
valuable
dollars
than
those
within
the
contemplation
and
intention
of
the
parties
when
contracted
would
operate
to
transfer
by
the
fiat
of
law
and
without
compensation
an
amount
of
property
and
a
volume
of
rights
and
interests
almost
incalculable
those
who
advocate
a
blind
and
headlong
plunge
to
free
coinage
in
the
name
of
bimetallism
and
professing
the
belief
contrary
to
all
experience
that
we
could
thus
establish
a
double
standard
and
a
concurrent
circulation
of
both
metals
in
our
coinage
are
certainly
reckoning
from
a
cloudy
standpoint
our
present
standard
of
value
is
the
standard
of
the
civilized
world
and
permits
the
only
bimetallism
now
possible
or
at
least
that
is
within
the
independent
reach
of
any
single
nation
however
powerful
that
nation
may
be
while
the
value
of
gold
as
a
standard
is
steadied
by
almost
universal
commercial
and
business
use
it
does
not
despise
silver
nor
seek
its
banishment
wherever
this
standard
is
maintained
there
is
at
its
side
in
free
and
unquestioned
circulation
a
volume
of
silver
currency
sometimes
equaling
and
sometimes
even
exceeding
it
in
amount
both
maintained
at
a
parity
notwithstanding
a
depreciation
or
fluctuation
in
the
intrinsic
value
of
silver
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
a
standard
of
value
and
a
currency
for
monetary
use
the
standard
must
necessarily
be
fixed
and
certain
the
currency
may
be
in
divers
forms
and
of
various
kinds
no
silverstandard
country
has
a
gold
currency
in
circulation
but
an
enlightened
and
wise
system
of
finance
secures
the
benefits
of
both
gold
and
silver
as
currency
and
circulating
medium
by
keeping
the
standard
stable
and
all
other
currency
at
par
with
it
such
a
system
and
such
a
standard
also
give
free
scope
for
the
use
and
expansion
of
safe
and
conservative
credit
so
indispensable
to
broad
and
growing
commercial
transactions
and
so
well
substituted
for
the
actual
use
of
money
if
a
fixed
and
stable
standard
is
maintained
such
as
the
magnitude
and
safety
of
our
commercial
transactions
and
business
require
the
use
of
money
itself
is
conveniently
minimized
every
dollar
of
fixed
and
stable
value
has
through
the
agency
of
confident
credit
an
astonishing
capacity
of
multiplying
itself
in
financial
work
every
unstable
and
fluctuating
dollar
fails
as
a
basis
of
credit
and
in
its
use
begets
gambling
speculation
and
undermines
the
foundations
of
honest
enterprise
i
have
ventured
to
express
myself
on
this
subject
with
earnestness
and
plainness
of
speech
because
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
the
belief
that
there
lurk
in
the
proposition
for
the
free
coinage
of
silver
so
strongly
approved
and
so
enthusiastically
advocated
by
a
multitude
of
my
countrymen
a
serious
menace
to
our
prosperity
and
an
insidious
temptation
of
our
people
to
wander
from
the
allegiance
they
owe
to
public
and
private
integrity
it
is
because
i
do
not
distrust
the
good
faith
and
sincerity
of
those
who
press
this
scheme
that
i
have
imperfectly
but
with
zeal
submitted
my
thoughts
upon
this
momentous
subject
i
can
not
refrain
from
begging
them
to
reexamine
their
views
and
beliefs
in
the
light
of
patriotic
reason
and
familiar
experience
and
to
weigh
again
and
again
the
consequences
of
such
legislation
as
their
efforts
have
invited
even
the
continued
agitation
of
the
subject
adds
greatly
to
the
difficulties
of
a
dangerous
financial
situation
already
forced
upon
us
in
conclusion
i
especially
entreat
the
peoples
representatives
in
the
congress
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
inaugurating
measures
for
the
safety
and
prosperity
of
our
common
country
to
promptly
and
effectively
consider
the
ills
of
our
critical
financial
plight
i
have
suggested
a
remedy
which
my
judgment
approves
i
desire
however
to
assure
the
congress
that
i
am
prepared
to
cooperate
with
them
in
perfecting
any
other
measure
promising
thorough
and
practical
relief
and
that
i
will
gladly
labor
with
them
in
every
patriotic
endeavor
to
further
the
interests
and
guard
the
welfare
of
our
countrymen
whom
in
our
respective
places
of
duty
we
have
undertaken
to
serve
grover
cleveland

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
assemblage
within
the
nations
legislative
halls
of
those
charged
with
the
duty
of
making
laws
for
the
benefit
of
a
generous
and
free
people
impressively
suggests
the
exacting
obligation
and
inexorable
responsibility
involved
in
their
task
at
the
threshold
of
such
labor
now
to
be
undertaken
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
discharge
of
an
executive
duty
enjoined
by
the
constitution
i
submit
this
communication
containing
a
brief
statement
of
the
condition
of
our
national
affairs
and
recommending
such
legislation
as
seems
to
me
necessary
and
expedient
the
history
of
our
recent
dealings
with
other
nations
and
our
peaceful
relations
with
them
at
this
time
additionally
demonstrate
the
advantage
of
consistently
adhering
to
a
firm
but
just
foreign
policy
free
from
envious
or
ambitious
national
schemes
and
characterized
by
entire
honesty
and
sincerity
during
the
past
year
pursuant
to
a
law
of
congress
commissioners
were
appointed
to
the
antwerp
industrial
exposition
though
the
participation
of
american
exhibitors
fell
far
short
of
completely
illustrating
our
national
ingenuity
and
industrial
achievements
yet
it
was
quite
creditable
in
view
of
the
brief
time
allowed
for
preparation
i
have
endeavored
to
impress
upon
the
belgian
government
the
heedlessness
and
positive
harmfulness
of
its
restrictions
upon
the
importation
of
certain
of
our
food
products
and
have
strongly
urged
that
the
rigid
supervision
and
inspection
under
our
laws
are
amply
sufficient
to
prevent
the
exportation
from
this
country
of
diseased
cattle
and
unwholesome
meat
the
termination
of
the
civil
war
in
brazil
has
been
followed
by
the
general
prevalence
of
peace
and
order
it
appearing
at
an
early
stage
of
the
insurrection
that
its
course
would
call
for
unusual
watchfulness
on
the
part
of
this
government
our
naval
force
in
the
harbor
of
rio
de
janeiro
was
strengthened
this
precaution
i
am
satisfied
tended
to
restrict
the
issue
to
a
simple
trial
of
strength
between
the
brazilian
government
and
the
insurgents
and
to
avert
complications
which
at
times
seemed
imminent
our
firm
attitude
of
neutrality
was
maintained
to
the
end
the
insurgents
received
no
encouragement
of
eventual
asylum
from
our
commanders
and
such
opposition
as
they
encountered
was
for
the
protection
of
our
commerce
and
was
clearly
justified
by
public
law
a
serious
tension
of
relations
having
arisen
at
the
close
of
the
war
between
brazil
and
portugal
by
reason
of
the
escape
of
the
insurgent
admiral
da
gama
and
his
followers
the
friendly
offices
of
our
representatives
to
those
countries
were
exerted
for
the
protection
of
the
subjects
of
either
within
the
territory
of
the
other
although
the
government
of
brazil
was
duly
notified
that
the
commercial
arrangement
existing
between
the
united
states
and
that
country
based
on
the
third
section
of
the
tariff
act
of
was
abrogated
on
august
by
the
taking
effect
of
the
tariff
law
now
in
force
that
government
subsequently
notified
us
of
its
intention
to
terminate
such
arrangement
on
the
st
day
of
january
in
the
exercise
of
the
right
reserved
in
the
agreement
between
the
two
countries
i
invite
attention
to
the
correspondence
between
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
brazilian
minister
on
this
subject
the
commission
organized
under
the
convention
which
we
had
entered
into
with
chile
for
the
settlement
of
the
outstanding
claims
of
each
government
against
the
other
adjourned
at
the
end
of
the
period
stipulated
for
its
continuance
leaving
undetermined
a
number
of
american
cases
which
had
been
duly
presented
these
claims
are
not
barred
and
negotiations
are
in
progress
for
their
submission
to
a
new
tribunal
on
the
th
of
march
last
a
new
treaty
with
china
in
further
regulation
of
emigration
was
signed
at
washington
and
on
august
it
received
the
sanction
of
the
senate
ratification
on
the
part
of
china
and
formal
exchange
are
awaited
to
give
effect
to
this
mutually
beneficial
convention
a
gratifying
recognition
of
the
uniform
impartiality
of
this
country
toward
all
foreign
states
was
manifested
by
the
coincident
request
of
the
chinese
and
japanese
governments
that
the
agents
of
the
united
states
should
within
proper
limits
afford
protection
to
the
subjects
of
the
other
during
the
suspension
of
diplomatic
relations
due
to
a
state
of
war
this
delicate
office
was
accepted
and
a
misapprehension
which
gave
rise
to
the
belief
that
in
affording
this
kindly
unofficial
protection
our
agents
would
exercise
the
same
authority
which
the
withdrawn
agents
of
the
belligerents
had
exercised
was
promptly
corrected
although
the
war
between
china
and
japan
endangers
no
policy
of
the
united
states
it
deserves
our
gravest
consideration
by
reason
of
its
disturbance
of
our
growing
commercial
interests
in
the
two
countries
and
the
increased
dangers
which
may
result
to
our
citizens
domiciled
or
sojourning
in
the
interior
of
china
acting
under
a
stipulation
in
our
treaty
with
korea
the
first
concluded
with
a
western
power
i
felt
constrained
at
the
beginning
of
the
controversy
to
tender
our
good
offices
to
induce
an
amicable
arrangement
of
the
initial
difficulty
growing
out
of
the
japanese
demands
for
administrative
reforms
in
korea
but
the
unhappy
precipitation
of
actual
hostilities
defeated
this
kindly
purpose
deploring
the
destructive
war
between
the
two
most
powerful
of
the
eastern
nations
and
anxious
that
our
commercial
interests
in
those
countries
may
be
preserved
and
that
the
safety
of
our
citizens
there
shall
not
be
jeopardized
i
would
not
hesitate
to
heed
any
intimation
that
our
friendly
aid
for
the
honorable
termination
of
hostilities
would
be
acceptable
to
both
belligerents
a
convention
has
been
finally
concluded
for
the
settlement
by
arbitration
of
the
prolonged
dispute
with
ecuador
growing
out
of
the
proceedings
against
emilio
santos
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
united
states
our
relations
with
the
republic
of
france
continue
to
be
such
as
should
exist
between
nations
so
long
bound
together
by
friendly
sympathy
and
similarity
in
their
form
of
government
the
recent
cruel
assassination
of
the
president
of
this
sister
republic
called
forth
such
universal
expressions
of
sorrow
and
condolence
from
our
people
and
government
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
the
depth
and
sincerity
of
our
attachment
the
resolutions
passed
by
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
on
the
occasion
have
been
communicated
to
the
widow
of
president
carnot
acting
upon
the
reported
discovery
of
texas
fever
in
cargoes
of
american
cattle
the
german
prohibition
against
importations
of
live
stock
and
fresh
meats
from
this
country
has
been
revived
it
is
hoped
that
germany
will
soon
become
convinced
that
the
inhibition
is
as
needless
as
it
is
harmful
to
mutual
interests
the
german
government
has
protested
against
that
provision
of
the
customs
tariff
act
which
imposes
a
discriminating
duty
of
onetenth
of
cent
a
pound
on
sugars
coming
from
countries
paying
an
export
bounty
thereon
claiming
that
the
exaction
of
such
duty
is
in
contravention
of
articles
v
and
ix
of
the
treaty
of
with
prussia
in
the
interests
of
the
commerce
of
both
countries
and
to
avoid
even
the
accusation
of
treaty
violation
i
recommend
the
repeal
of
so
much
of
the
statute
as
imposes
that
duty
and
i
invite
attention
to
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
containing
a
discussion
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
german
protests
early
in
the
present
year
an
agreement
was
reached
with
great
britain
concerning
instructions
to
be
given
to
the
naval
commanders
of
the
two
governments
in
bering
sea
and
the
contiguous
north
pacific
ocean
for
their
guidance
in
the
execution
of
the
award
of
the
paris
tribunal
of
arbitration
and
the
enforcement
of
the
regulations
therein
prescribed
for
the
protection
of
seal
life
in
the
waters
mentioned
an
understanding
has
also
been
reached
for
the
payment
by
the
united
states
of
in
full
satisfaction
of
all
claims
which
may
be
made
by
great
britain
for
damages
growing
out
of
the
controversy
as
to
fur
seals
in
bering
sea
or
the
seizure
of
british
vessels
engaged
in
taking
seal
in
those
waters
the
award
and
findings
of
the
paris
tribunal
to
a
great
extent
determined
the
facts
and
principles
upon
which
these
claims
should
be
adjusted
and
they
have
been
subjected
by
both
governments
to
a
thorough
examination
upon
the
principles
as
well
as
the
facts
which
they
involve
i
am
convinced
that
a
settlement
upon
the
terms
mentioned
would
be
an
equitable
and
advantageous
one
and
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
the
prompt
payment
of
the
stated
sum
thus
far
only
france
and
portugal
have
signified
their
willingness
to
adhere
to
the
regulations
established
under
the
award
of
the
paris
tribunal
of
arbitration
preliminary
surveys
of
the
alaskan
boundary
and
a
preparatory
examination
of
the
question
of
protection
of
food
fish
in
the
contiguous
waters
of
the
united
states
and
the
dominion
of
canada
are
in
progress
the
boundary
of
british
guiana
still
remains
in
dispute
between
great
britain
and
venezuela
believing
that
its
early
settlement
on
some
just
basis
alike
honorable
to
both
parties
is
in
the
line
of
our
established
policy
to
remove
from
this
hemisphere
all
causes
of
difference
with
powers
beyond
the
sea
i
shall
renew
the
efforts
heretofore
made
to
bring
about
a
restoration
of
diplomatic
relations
between
the
disputants
and
to
induce
a
reference
to
arbitrationa
resort
which
great
britain
so
conspicuously
favors
in
principle
and
respects
in
practice
and
which
is
earnestly
sought
by
her
weaker
adversary
since
communicating
the
voluminous
correspondence
in
regard
to
hawaii
and
the
action
taken
by
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
on
certain
questions
submitted
to
the
judgment
and
wider
discretion
of
congress
the
organization
of
a
government
in
place
of
the
provisional
arrangement
which
followed
the
deposition
of
the
queen
has
been
announced
with
evidence
of
its
effective
operation
the
recognition
usual
in
such
cases
has
been
accorded
the
new
government
under
our
present
treatie
s
of
extradition
with
italy
miscarriages
of
justice
have
occurred
owing
to
the
refusal
of
that
government
to
surrender
its
own
subjects
thus
far
our
efforts
to
negotiate
an
amended
convention
obviating
this
difficulty
have
been
unavailing
apart
from
the
war
in
which
the
island
empire
is
engaged
japan
attracts
increasing
attention
in
this
country
by
her
evident
desire
to
cultivate
more
liberal
intercourse
with
us
and
to
seek
our
kindly
aid
in
furtherance
of
her
laudable
desire
for
complete
autonomy
in
her
domestic
affairs
and
full
equality
in
the
family
of
nations
the
japanese
empire
of
today
is
no
longer
the
japan
of
the
past
and
our
relations
with
this
progressive
nation
should
not
be
less
broad
and
liberal
than
those
with
other
powers
good
will
fostered
by
many
interests
in
common
has
marked
our
relations
with
our
nearest
southern
neighbor
peace
being
restored
along
her
northern
frontier
mexico
has
asked
the
punishment
of
the
late
disturbers
of
her
tranquillity
there
ought
to
be
a
new
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
with
that
country
to
take
the
place
of
the
one
which
terminated
thirteen
years
ago
the
friendliness
of
the
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
is
attested
by
the
fact
that
during
this
long
period
the
commerce
of
each
has
steadily
increased
under
the
rule
of
mutual
consideration
being
neither
stimulated
by
conventional
arrangements
nor
retarded
by
jealous
rivalries
or
selfish
distrust
an
indemnity
tendered
by
mexico
as
a
gracious
act
for
the
murder
in
of
leon
baldwin
an
american
citizen
by
a
band
of
marauders
in
durango
has
been
accepted
and
is
being
paid
in
installments
the
problem
of
the
storage
and
use
of
the
waters
of
the
rio
grande
for
irrigation
should
be
solved
by
appropriate
concurrent
action
of
the
two
interested
countries
rising
in
the
colorado
heights
the
stream
flows
intermittently
yielding
little
water
during
the
dry
months
to
the
irrigation
channels
already
constructed
along
its
course
this
scarcity
is
often
severely
felt
in
the
regions
where
the
river
forms
a
common
boundary
moreover
the
frequent
changes
in
its
course
through
level
sands
often
raise
embarrassing
questions
of
territorial
jurisdiction
prominent
among
the
questions
of
the
year
was
the
bluefields
incident
in
what
is
known
as
the
mosquito
indian
strip
bordering
on
the
atlantic
ocean
and
within
the
jurisdiction
of
nicaragua
by
the
treaty
of
between
great
britain
and
nicaragua
the
former
government
expressly
recognized
the
sovereignty
of
the
latter
over
the
strip
and
a
limited
form
of
selfgovernment
was
guaranteed
to
the
mosquito
indians
to
be
exercised
according
to
their
customs
for
themselves
and
other
dwellers
within
its
limits
the
socalled
native
government
which
grew
to
be
largely
made
up
of
aliens
for
many
years
disputed
the
sovereignty
of
nicaragua
over
the
strip
and
claimed
the
right
to
maintain
therein
a
practically
independent
municipal
government
early
in
the
past
year
efforts
of
nicaragua
to
maintain
sovereignty
over
the
mosquito
territory
led
to
serious
disturbances
culminating
in
the
suppression
of
the
native
government
and
the
attempted
substitution
of
an
impracticable
composite
administration
in
which
nicaragua
and
alien
residents
were
to
participate
failure
was
followed
by
an
insurrection
which
for
a
time
subverted
nicaraguan
rule
expelling
her
officers
and
restoring
the
old
organization
this
in
turn
gave
place
to
the
existing
local
government
established
and
upheld
by
nicaragua
although
the
alien
interests
arrayed
against
nicaragua
in
these
transactions
have
been
largely
american
and
the
commerce
of
that
region
for
some
time
has
been
and
still
is
chiefly
controlled
by
our
citizens
we
can
not
for
that
reason
challenge
the
rightful
sovereignty
of
nicaragua
over
this
important
part
of
her
domain
for
some
months
one
and
during
part
of
the
time
two
of
our
naval
ships
have
been
stationed
at
bluefields
for
the
protection
of
all
legitimate
interests
of
our
citizens
in
september
last
the
government
at
managua
expelled
from
its
territory
twelve
or
more
foreigners
including
two
americans
for
alleged
participation
in
the
seditious
or
revolutionary
movements
against
the
republic
at
bluefields
already
mentioned
but
through
the
earnest
remonstrance
of
this
government
the
two
americans
have
been
permitted
to
return
to
the
peaceful
management
of
their
business
our
naval
commanders
at
the
scene
of
these
disturbances
by
their
constant
exhibition
of
firmness
and
good
judgment
contributed
largely
to
the
prevention
of
more
serious
consequences
and
to
the
restoration
of
quiet
and
order
i
regret
that
in
the
midst
of
these
occurrences
there
happened
a
most
grave
and
irritating
failure
of
nicaraguan
justice
an
american
citizen
named
wilson
residing
at
rama
in
the
mosquito
territory
was
murdered
by
one
arguello
the
acting
governor
of
the
town
after
some
delay
the
murderer
was
arrested
but
so
insecurely
confined
or
guarded
that
he
escaped
and
notwithstanding
our
repeated
demands
it
is
claimed
that
his
recapture
has
been
impossible
by
reason
of
his
flight
beyond
nicaraguan
jurisdiction
the
nicaraguan
authorities
having
given
notice
of
forfeiture
of
their
concession
to
the
canal
company
on
grounds
purely
technical
and
not
embraced
in
the
contract
have
receded
from
that
position
peru
i
regret
to
say
shows
symptoms
of
domestic
disturbance
due
probably
to
the
slowness
of
her
recuperation
from
the
distresses
of
the
war
of
weakened
in
resources
her
difficulties
in
facing
international
obligations
invite
our
kindly
sympathy
and
justify
our
forbearance
in
pressing
longpending
claims
i
have
felt
constrained
to
testify
this
sympathy
in
connection
with
certain
demands
urgently
preferred
by
other
powers
the
recent
death
of
the
czar
of
russia
called
forth
appropriate
expressions
of
sorrow
and
sympathy
on
the
part
of
our
government
with
his
bereaved
family
and
the
russian
people
as
a
further
demonstration
of
respect
and
friendship
our
minister
at
st
petersburg
was
directed
to
represent
our
government
at
the
funeral
ceremonies
the
sealing
interests
of
russia
in
bering
sea
are
second
only
to
our
own
a
modus
vivendi
has
therefore
been
concluded
with
the
imperial
government
restrictive
of
poaching
on
the
russian
rookeries
and
of
sealing
in
waters
which
were
not
comprehended
in
the
protected
area
defined
in
the
paris
award
occasion
has
been
found
to
urge
upon
the
russian
government
equality
of
treatment
for
our
great
lifeinsurance
companies
whose
operations
have
been
extended
throughout
europe
admitting
as
we
do
foreign
corporations
to
transact
business
in
the
united
states
we
naturally
expect
no
less
tolerance
for
our
own
in
the
ample
fields
of
competition
abroad
but
few
cases
of
interference
with
naturalized
citizens
returning
to
russia
have
been
reported
during
the
current
year
one
krzeminski
was
arrested
last
summer
in
a
polish
province
on
a
reported
charge
of
unpermitted
renunciation
of
russian
allegiance
but
it
transpired
that
the
proceedings
originated
in
alleged
malfeasance
committed
by
krzeminski
while
an
imperial
official
a
number
of
years
ago
efforts
for
his
release
which
promised
to
be
successful
were
in
progress
when
his
death
was
reported
the
government
of
salvador
having
been
overthrown
by
an
abrupt
popular
outbreak
certain
of
its
military
and
civil
officers
while
hotly
pursued
by
infuriated
insurgents
sought
refuge
on
board
the
united
states
war
ship
bennington
then
lying
in
a
salvadorean
port
although
the
practice
of
asylum
is
not
favored
by
this
government
yet
in
view
of
the
imminent
peril
which
threatened
the
fugitives
and
solely
from
considerations
of
humanity
they
were
afforded
shelter
by
our
naval
commander
and
when
afterwards
demanded
under
our
treaty
of
extradition
with
salvador
for
trial
on
charges
of
murder
arson
and
robbery
i
directed
that
such
of
them
as
had
not
voluntarily
left
the
ship
be
conveyed
to
one
of
our
nearest
ports
where
a
hearing
could
be
had
before
a
judicial
officer
in
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
treaty
on
their
arrival
at
san
francisco
such
a
proceeding
was
promptly
instituted
before
the
united
states
district
judge
who
held
that
the
acts
constituting
the
alleged
offenses
were
political
and
discharged
all
the
accused
except
one
cienfuegos
who
was
held
for
an
attempt
to
murder
thereupon
i
was
constrained
to
direct
his
release
for
the
reason
that
an
attempt
to
murder
was
not
one
of
the
crimes
charged
against
him
and
upon
which
his
surrender
to
the
salvadorean
authorities
had
been
demanded
unreasonable
and
unjust
fines
imposed
by
spain
on
the
vessels
and
commerce
of
the
united
states
have
demanded
from
time
to
time
during
the
last
twenty
years
earnest
remonstrance
on
the
part
of
our
government
in
the
immediate
past
exorbitant
penalties
have
been
imposed
upon
our
vessels
and
goods
by
customs
authorities
of
cuba
and
puerto
rico
for
clerical
errors
of
the
most
trivial
character
in
the
manifests
of
bills
of
lading
in
some
cases
fines
amounting
to
thousands
of
dollars
have
been
levied
upon
cargoes
or
the
carrying
vessels
when
the
goods
in
question
were
entitled
to
free
entry
fines
have
been
exacted
even
when
the
error
had
been
detected
and
the
spanish
authorities
notified
before
the
arrival
of
the
goods
in
port
this
conduct
is
in
strange
contrast
with
the
considerate
and
liberal
treatment
extended
to
spanish
vessels
and
cargoes
in
our
ports
in
like
cases
no
satisfactory
settlement
of
these
vexatious
questions
has
yet
been
reached
the
mora
case
referred
to
in
my
last
annual
message
remains
unsettled
from
the
diplomatic
correspondence
on
this
subject
which
has
been
laid
before
the
senate
it
will
be
seen
that
this
government
has
offered
to
conclude
a
convention
with
spain
for
disposal
by
arbitration
of
outstanding
claims
between
the
two
countries
except
the
mora
claim
which
having
been
long
ago
adjusted
now
only
awaits
payment
as
stipulated
and
of
course
it
could
not
be
included
in
the
proposed
convention
it
was
hoped
that
this
offer
would
remove
parliamentary
obstacles
encountered
by
the
spanish
government
i
n
providing
payment
of
the
mora
indemnity
i
regret
to
say
that
no
definite
reply
to
this
offer
has
yet
been
made
and
all
efforts
to
secure
payment
of
this
settled
claim
have
been
unavailing
in
my
last
annual
message
i
adverted
to
the
claim
on
the
part
of
turkey
of
the
right
to
expel
as
persons
undesirable
and
dangerous
armenians
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
returning
to
turkish
jurisdiction
numerous
questions
in
this
relation
have
arisen
while
this
government
acquiesces
in
the
asserted
right
of
expulsion
it
will
not
consent
that
armenians
may
be
imprisoned
or
otherwise
punished
for
no
other
reason
than
having
acquired
without
imperial
consent
american
citizenship
three
of
the
assailants
of
miss
melton
an
american
teacher
in
mosul
have
been
convicted
by
the
ottoman
courts
and
i
am
advised
that
an
appeal
against
the
acquittal
of
the
remaining
five
has
been
taken
by
the
turkish
prosecuting
officer
a
convention
has
been
concluded
with
venezuela
for
the
arbitration
of
a
longdisputed
claim
growing
out
of
the
seizure
of
certain
vessels
the
property
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
although
signed
the
treaty
of
extradition
with
venezuela
is
not
yet
in
force
owing
to
the
insistence
of
that
government
that
when
surrendered
its
citizens
shall
in
no
case
be
liable
to
capital
punishment
the
rules
for
the
prevention
of
collisions
at
sea
which
were
framed
by
the
maritime
conference
held
in
this
city
in
having
been
concurrently
incorporated
in
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain
have
been
announced
to
take
effect
march
and
invitations
have
been
extended
to
all
maritime
nations
to
adhere
to
them
favorable
responses
have
thus
far
been
received
from
austria
france
portugal
spain
and
sweden
in
my
last
annual
message
i
referred
briefly
to
the
unsatisfactory
state
of
affairs
in
samoa
under
the
operation
of
the
berlin
treaty
as
signally
illustrating
the
impolicy
of
entangling
alliances
with
foreign
powers
and
on
may
in
response
to
a
resolution
of
the
senate
i
sent
a
special
message
and
documents
to
that
body
on
the
same
subject
which
emphasized
my
previously
expressed
opinions
later
occurrences
the
correspondence
in
regard
to
which
will
be
laid
before
the
congress
further
demonstrate
that
the
government
which
was
devised
by
the
three
powers
and
forced
upon
the
samoans
against
their
inveterate
hostility
can
be
maintained
only
by
the
continued
presence
of
foreign
military
force
and
at
no
small
sacrifice
of
life
and
treasure
the
suppression
of
the
mataafa
insurrection
by
the
powers
and
the
subsequent
banishment
of
the
leader
and
eleven
other
chiefs
as
recited
in
my
last
message
did
not
bring
lasting
peace
to
the
islands
formidable
uprisings
continued
and
finally
a
rebellion
broke
out
in
the
capital
island
upolu
headed
in
aana
the
western
district
by
the
younger
tamasese
and
in
atua
the
eastern
district
by
other
leaders
the
insurgents
ravaged
the
country
and
fought
the
governments
troops
up
to
the
very
doors
of
apia
the
king
again
appealed
to
the
powers
for
help
and
the
combined
british
and
german
naval
forces
reduced
the
atuans
to
apparent
subjection
not
however
without
considerable
loss
to
the
natives
a
few
days
later
tamasese
and
his
adherents
fearing
the
ships
and
the
marines
professed
submission
reports
received
from
our
agents
at
apia
do
not
justify
the
belief
that
the
peace
thus
brought
about
will
be
of
long
duration
it
is
their
conviction
that
the
natives
are
at
heart
hostile
to
the
present
government
that
such
of
them
as
profess
loyalty
to
it
do
so
from
fear
of
the
powers
and
that
it
would
speedily
go
to
pieces
if
the
war
ships
were
withdrawn
in
reporting
to
his
government
on
the
unsatisfactory
situation
since
the
suppression
of
the
late
revolt
by
foreign
armed
forces
the
german
consul
at
apia
stated
that
peace
will
be
lasting
is
hardly
to
be
presumed
the
lesson
given
by
firing
on
atua
was
not
sufficiently
sharp
and
incisive
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
on
the
forgetful
samoan
temperament
in
fact
conditions
are
existing
which
show
that
peace
will
not
last
and
is
not
seriously
intended
malietoa
the
king
and
his
chiefs
are
convinced
that
the
departure
of
the
war
ships
will
be
a
signal
for
a
renewal
of
war
the
circumstance
that
the
representatives
of
the
villages
of
all
the
districts
which
were
opposed
to
the
government
have
already
withdrawn
to
atua
to
hold
meetings
and
that
both
atua
and
aana
have
forbidden
inhabitants
of
those
districts
which
fought
on
the
side
of
the
government
to
return
to
their
villages
and
have
already
partly
burned
down
the
latter
indicates
that
a
real
conciliation
of
the
parties
is
still
far
off
and
in
a
note
of
the
th
ultimo
inclosing
a
copy
of
that
report
for
the
information
of
this
government
the
german
ambassador
said
the
contents
of
the
report
awakened
the
imperial
governments
apprehension
that
under
existing
circumstances
the
peace
concluded
with
the
rebels
will
afford
no
assurance
of
the
lasting
restoration
of
tranquillity
in
the
islands
the
present
government
has
utterly
failed
to
correct
if
indeed
it
has
not
aggravated
the
very
evils
it
was
intended
to
prevent
it
has
not
stimulated
our
commerce
with
the
islands
our
participation
in
its
establishment
against
the
wishes
of
the
natives
was
in
plain
defiance
of
the
conservative
teachings
and
warnings
of
the
wise
and
patriotic
men
who
laid
the
foundations
of
our
free
institutions
and
i
invite
an
expression
of
the
judgment
of
congress
on
the
propriety
of
steps
being
taken
by
this
government
looking
to
the
withdrawal
from
its
engagements
with
the
other
powers
on
some
reasonable
terms
not
prejudicial
to
any
of
our
existing
rights
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
reports
that

of

in
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
it
appears
that
the
strengt
h
of
the
army
on
september
was
officers
and
enlisted
men
although
this
is
apparently
a
very
slight
decrease
compared
with
the
previous
year
the
actual
effective
force
has
been
increased
to
the
equivalent
of
nearly
two
regiments
through
the
reorganization
of
the
system
of
recruiting
and
the
consequent
release
to
regimental
duty
of
the
large
force
of
men
hitherto
serving
at
the
recruiting
depots
the
abolition
of
these
depots
it
is
predicted
will
furthermore
effect
an
annual
reduction
approximating
in
the
direct
expenditures
besides
promoting
generally
the
health
morale
and
discipline
of
the
troops
the
execution
of
the
policy
of
concentrating
the
army
at
important
centers
of
population
and
transportation
foreshadowed
in
the
last
annual
report
of
the
secretary
has
resulted
in
the
abandonment
of
fifteen
of
the
smaller
posts
which
was
effected
under
a
plan
which
assembles
organizations
of
the
same
regiments
hitherto
widely
separated
this
renders
our
small
forces
more
readily
effective
for
any
service
which
they
may
be
called
upon
to
perform
increases
the
extent
of
the
territory
under
protection
without
diminishing
the
security
heretofore
afforded
to
any
locality
improves
the
discipline
training
and
esprit
de
corps
of
the
army
besides
considerably
decreasing
the
cost
of
its
maintenance
though
the
forces
of
the
department
of
the
east
have
been
somewhat
increased
more
than
threefourths
of
the
army
is
still
stationed
west
of
the
mississippi
this
carefully
matured
policy
which
secures
the
best
and
greatest
service
in
the
interests
of
the
general
welfare
from
the
small
force
comprising
our
regular
army
should
not
be
thoughtlessly
embarrassed
by
the
creation
of
new
and
unnecessary
posts
through
acts
of
congress
to
gratify
the
ambitions
or
interests
of
localities
while
the
maximum
legal
strength
of
the
army
is
men
the
effective
strength
through
various
causes
is
but
little
over
men
the
purpose
of
congress
does
not
therefore
seem
to
be
fully
attained
by
the
existing
condition
while
no
considerable
increase
in
the
army
is
in
my
judgment
demanded
by
recent
events
the
policy
of
seacoast
fortification
in
the
prosecution
of
which
we
have
been
steadily
engaged
for
some
years
has
so
far
developed
as
to
suggest
that
the
effective
strength
of
the
army
be
now
made
at
least
equal
to
the
legal
strength
measures
taken
by
the
department
during
the
year
as
indicated
have
already
considerably
augmented
the
effective
force
and
the
secretary
of
war
presents
a
plan
which
i
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
to
attain
the
desired
end
economies
effected
in
the
department
in
other
lines
of
its
work
will
offset
to
a
great
extent
the
expenditure
involved
in
the
proposition
submitted
among
other
things
this
contemplates
the
adoption
of
the
threebattalion
formation
of
regiments
which
for
several
years
has
been
indorsed
by
the
secretaries
of
war
and
the
generals
commanding
the
army
compact
in
itself
it
provides
a
skeleton
organization
ready
to
be
filled
out
in
the
event
of
war
which
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
our
strength
and
requirements
and
the
fact
that
every
other
nation
with
a
single
exception
has
adopted
this
formation
to
meet
the
conditions
of
modern
warfare
should
alone
secure
for
the
recommendation
an
early
consideration
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
recall
the
fact
that
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
and
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
property
of
the
united
states
aiding
the
process
of
federal
courts
and
removing
lawless
obstructions
to
the
performance
by
the
government
of
its
legitimate
functions
it
became
necessary
in
various
localities
during
the
year
to
employ
a
considerable
portion
of
the
regular
troops
the
duty
was
discharged
promptly
courageously
and
with
marked
discretion
by
the
officers
and
men
and
the
most
gratifying
proof
was
thus
afforded
that
the
army
deserves
that
complete
confidence
in
its
efficiency
and
discipline
which
the
country
has
at
all
times
manifested
the
year
has
been
free
from
disturbances
by
indians
and
the
chances
of
further
depredations
on
their
part
are
constantly
becoming
more
remote
and
improbable
the
total
expenditures
for
the
war
department
for
the
year
ended
june
amounted
to
of
this
sum
was
for
salaries
and
contingent
expenses
for
the
support
of
the
military
establishment
for
miscellaneous
objects
and
for
public
works
this
latter
sum
includes
for
river
and
harbor
improvements
and
for
fortifications
and
other
works
of
defense
the
appropriations
for
the
current
year
aggregate
and
the
estimates
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
war
for
the
next
fiscal
year
call
for
appropriations
amounting
to
the
skill
and
industry
of
our
ordnance
officers
and
inventors
have
it
is
believed
overcome
the
mechanical
obstacles
which
have
heretofore
delayed
the
armament
of
our
coasts
and
this
great
national
undertaking
upon
which
we
have
entered
may
now
proceed
as
rapidly
as
congress
shall
determine
with
a
supply
of
finished
guns
of
large
caliber
already
on
hand
to
which
additions
should
now
rapidly
follow
the
wisdom
of
providing
carriages
and
emplacements
for
their
mount
can
not
be
too
strongly
urged
the
total
enrollment
of
the
militia
of
the
several
states
is
officers
and
enlisted
men
an
increase
of
over
the
number
reported
at
the
close
of
the
previous
year
the
reports
of
militia
inspections
by
regular
army
officers
show
a
marked
increase
in
interest
and
efficiency
among
the
state
organizations
and
i
strongly
recommend
a
continuance
of
the
policy
of
affording
every
practical
encouragement
possible
to
this
important
auxiliary
of
our
military
establishment
the
condition
of
the
apache
indians
held
as
prisoners
by
the
government
for
eight
years
at
a
cost
of
half
a
million
dollars
has
been
changed
during
the
year
from
captivity
to
one
which
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
their
capacity
for
selfsupport
and
at
least
partial
civilization
legislation
enacted
at
the
late
session
of
congress
gave
the
war
department
authority
to
transfer
the
survivors
numbering
from
mount
vernon
barracks
in
alabama
to
any
suitable
reservation
the
department
selected
as
their
future
home
the
military
lands
near
fort
sill
ind
t
where
under
military
surveillance
the
former
prisoners
have
been
established
in
agriculture
under
conditions
favorable
to
their
advancement
in
recognition
of
the
long
and
distinguished
military
services
and
faithful
discharge
of
delicate
and
responsible
civil
duties
by
majorgeneral
john
m
schofield
now
the
general
commanding
the
army
it
is
suggested
to
congress
that
the
temporary
revival
of
the
grade
of
lieutenantgeneral
in
his
behalf
would
be
a
just
and
gracious
act
and
would
permit
his
retirement
now
near
at
hand
with
rank
befitting
his
merits
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
notes
the
gratifying
progress
made
by
the
supreme
court
in
overcoming
the
arrears
of
its
business
and
in
reaching
a
condition
in
which
it
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
cases
as
they
arise
without
any
unreasonable
delay
this
result
is
of
course
very
largely
due
to
the
successful
working
of
the
plan
inaugurating
circuit
courts
of
appeals
in
respect
to
these
tribunals
the
suggestion
is
made
in
quarters
entitled
to
the
highest
consideration
that
an
additional
circuit
judge
for
each
circuit
would
greatly
strengthen
these
courts
and
the
confidence
reposed
in
their
adjudications
and
that
such
an
addition
would
not
create
a
greater
force
of
judges
than
the
increasing
business
of
such
courts
requires
i
commend
the
suggestion
to
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
other
important
topics
are
adverted
to
in
the
report
accompanied
by
recommendations
many
of
which
have
been
treated
at
large
in
previous
messages
and
at
this
time
therefore
need
only
be
named
i
refer
to
the
abolition
of
the
fee
system
as
a
measure
of
compensation
to
federal
officers
the
enlargement
of
the
powers
of
united
states
commissioners
at
least
in
the
territories
the
allowance
of
writs
of
error
in
criminal
cases
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
establishment
of
degrees
in
the
crime
of
murder
a
topic
dealt
with
by
the
attorneygeneral
of
much
importance
is
the
condition
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
indian
territory
the
permanent
solution
of
what
is
called
the
indian
problem
is
probably
not
to
be
expected
at
once
but
meanwhile
such
ameliorations
of
present
conditions
as
the
existing
system
will
admit
of
ought
not
to
be
neglected
i
am
satisfied
there
should
be
a
federal
court
established
for
the
territory
with
sufficient
judges
and
that
this
court
should
sit
within
the
territory
and
have
the
same
jurisdiction
as
to
territorial
affairs
as
is
now
vested
in
the
federal
courts
sitting
in
arkansas
and
texas
another
subject
of
pressing
moment
referred
to
by
the
attorneygeneral
is
the
reorganization
of
the
union
pacific
railway
company
on
a
basis
equitable
as
regards
all
private
interests
and
as
favorable
to
the
government
as
existing
conditions
will
permit
the
operation
of
a
railroad
by
a
court
through
a
receiver
is
an
anomalous
state
of
things
which
should
be
terminated
on
all
grounds
public
and
private
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
besides
not
to
enact
the
needed
enabling
legislation
at
the
present
session
postpones
the
whole
matter
until
the
assembling
of
a
new
congress
and
inevitably
increases
all
the
complications
of
the
situation
and
could
not
but
be
regarded
as
a
signal
failure
to
solve
a
problem
which
has
practically
been
before
the
present
congress
ever
since
its
organization
eight
years
ago
in
my
annual
message
i
urged
upon
the
congress
as
strongly
as
i
could
the
location
and
construction
of
two
prisons
for
the
confinement
of
united
states
prisoners
a
similar
recommendation
has
been
made
from
time
to
time
since
and
a
few
years
ago
a
law
was
passed
providing
for
the
selection
of
sites
for
three
such
institutions
no
appropriation
has
however
been
made
to
carry
the
act
into
effect
and
the
old
and
discreditable
condition
still
exists
it
is
not
my
purpose
at
this
time
to
repeat
the
considerations
which
make
an
impregnable
case
in
favor
of
the
ow
nership
and
management
by
the
government
of
the
penal
institutions
in
which
federal
prisoners
are
confined
i
simply
desire
to
again
urge
former
recommendations
on
the
subject
and
to
particularly
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
that
part
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
in
which
he
states
that
the
military
prison
at
fort
leavenworth
kans
can
be
turned
over
to
the
government
as
a
prison
for
federal
convicts
without
the
least
difficulty
and
with
an
actual
saving
of
money
from
every
point
of
view
pending
a
more
complete
reform
i
hope
that
by
the
adoption
of
the
suggestion
of
the
secretary
of
war
this
easy
step
may
be
taken
in
the
direction
of
the
proper
care
of
its
convicts
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
presents
a
comprehensive
statement
of
the
operations
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
last
fiscal
year
the
receipts
of
the
department
during
the
year
amounted
to
and
the
expenditures
to
the
transactions
of
the
postal
service
indicate
with
barometric
certainty
the
fluctuations
in
the
business
of
the
country
inasmuch
therefore
as
business
complications
continued
to
exist
throughout
the
last
year
to
an
unforeseen
extent
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
deficiency
of
revenue
to
meet
the
expenditures
of
the
postoffice
department
which
was
estimated
in
advance
at
about
should
be
exceeded
by
nearly
the
ascertained
revenues
of
the
last
year
which
were
the
basis
of
calculation
for
the
current
year
being
less
than
estimated
the
deficiency
for
the
current
year
will
be
correspondingly
greater
though
the
postmastergeneral
states
that
the
latest
indications
are
so
favorable
that
he
confidently
predicts
an
increase
of
at
least
per
cent
in
the
revenues
of
the
current
year
over
those
of
the
last
year
the
expenditures
increase
steadily
and
necessarily
with
the
growth
and
needs
of
the
country
so
that
the
deficiency
is
greater
or
less
in
any
year
depending
upon
the
volume
of
receipts
the
postmastergeneral
states
that
this
deficiency
is
unnecessary
and
might
be
obviated
at
once
if
the
law
regulating
rates
upon
mail
matter
of
the
second
class
was
modified
the
rate
received
for
the
transmission
of
this
secondclass
matter
is
cent
per
pound
while
the
cost
of
such
transmission
to
the
government
is
eight
times
that
amount
in
the
general
terms
of
the
law
this
rate
covers
newspapers
and
periodicals
the
extensions
of
the
meaning
of
these
terms
from
time
to
time
have
admitted
to
the
privileges
intended
for
legitimate
newspapers
and
periodicals
a
surprising
range
of
publications
and
created
abuses
the
cost
of
which
amounts
in
the
aggregate
to
the
total
deficiency
of
the
postoffice
department
pretended
newspapers
are
started
by
business
houses
for
the
mere
purpose
of
advertising
goods
complying
with
the
law
in
form
only
and
discontinuing
the
publications
as
soon
as
the
period
of
advertising
is
over
sample
copies
of
pretended
newspapers
are
issued
in
great
numbers
for
a
like
purpose
only
the
result
is
a
great
loss
of
revenue
to
the
government
besides
its
humiliating
use
as
an
agency
to
aid
in
carrying
out
the
scheme
of
a
business
house
to
advertise
its
goods
by
means
of
a
trick
upon
both
its
rival
houses
and
the
regular
and
legitimate
newspapers
papercovered
literature
consisting
mainly
of
trashy
novels
to
the
extent
of
many
thousands
of
tons
is
sent
through
the
mails
at
cent
per
pound
while
the
publishers
of
standard
works
are
required
to
pay
eight
times
that
amount
in
sending
their
publications
another
abuse
consists
in
the
free
carriage
through
the
mails
of
hundreds
of
tons
of
seed
and
grain
uselessly
distributed
through
the
department
of
agriculture
the
postmastergeneral
predicts
that
if
the
law
be
so
amended
as
to
eradicate
these
abuses
not
only
will
the
postoffice
department
show
no
deficiency
but
he
believes
that
in
the
near
future
all
legitimate
newspapers
and
periodical
magazines
might
be
properly
transmitted
through
the
mails
to
their
subscribers
free
of
cost
i
invite
your
prompt
consideration
of
this
subject
and
fully
indorse
the
views
of
the
postmastergeneral
the
total
number
of
postoffices
in
the
united
states
on
the
th
day
of
june
was
an
increase
of
over
the
preceding
year
of
these
were
presidential
an
increase
in
that
class
of
over
the
preceding
year
six
hundred
and
ten
cities
and
towns
are
provided
with
free
delivery
ninetythree
other
cities
and
towns
entitled
to
this
service
under
the
law
have
not
been
accorded
it
on
account
of
insufficient
funds
the
expense
of
free
delivery
for
the
current
fiscal
year
will
be
more
than
and
under
existing
legislation
this
item
of
expenditure
is
subject
to
constant
increase
the
estimated
cost
of
rural
free
delivery
generally
is
so
very
large
that
it
ought
not
to
be
considered
in
the
present
condition
of
affairs
during
the
year
additional
domestic
moneyorder
offices
were
established
the
total
number
of
these
offices
at
the
close
of
the
year

the
year

an
increase
over
the

the

the

it
appears
that

amounted
to
the
number
of

the
report
shows
most
gratifying
results
in
the
way
of
economies
worked
out
without
affecting
the
efficiency
of
the
postal
service
these
consist
in
the
abrogation
of
steamship
subsidy
contracts
reletting
of
mail
transportation
contracts
and
in
the
cost
and
amount
of
supplies
used
in
the
service
amounting
in
all
to
this
report
also
contains
a
valuable
contribution
to
the
history
of
the
universal
postal
union
an
arrangement
which
amounts
practically
to
the
establishment
of
one
postal
system
for
the
entire
civilized
world
special
attention
is
directed
to
this
subject
at
this
time
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
next
congress
of
the
union
will
meet
in
washington
in
and
it
is
hoped
that
timely
action
will
be
taken
in
the
direction
of
perfecting
preparations
for
that
event
the
postmastergeneral
renews
the
suggestion
made
in
a
previous
report
that
the
department
organization
be
increased
to
the
extent
of
creating
a
direct
district
supervision
of
all
postal
affairs
and
in
this
suggestion
i
fully
concur
there
are
now
connected
with
the
postoffice
establishment
employees
who
are
in
the
classified
service
this
includes
many
who
have
been
classified
upon
the
suggestion
of
the
postmastergeneral
he
states
that
another
years
experience
at
the
head
of
the
department
serves
only
to
strengthen
the
conviction
as
to
the
excellent
working
of
the
civilservice
law
in
this
branch
of
the
public
service
attention
is
called
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
which
shows
very
gratifying
progress
in
the
construction
of
ships
for
our
new
navy
all
the
vessels
now
building
including
the
three
torpedo
boats
authorized
at
the
last
session
of
congress
and
excepting
the
firstclass
battle
ship
iowa
will
probably
be
completed
during
the
coming
fiscal
year
the
estimates
for
the
increase
of
the
navy
for
the
year
ending
june
are
large
but
they
include
practically
the
entire
sum
necessary
to
complete
and
equip
all
the
new
ships
not
now
in
commission
so
that
unless
new
ships
are
authorized
the
appropriations
for
the
naval
service
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
should
fall
below
the
estimates
for
the
coming
year
by
at
least
the
secretary
presents
with
much
earnestness
a
plea
for
the
authorization
of
three
additional
battle
ships
and
ten
or
twelve
torpedo
boats
while
the
unarmored
vessels
heretofore
authorized
including
those
now
nearing
completion
will
constitute
a
fleet
which
it
is
believed
is
sufficient
for
ordinary
cruising
purposes
in
time
of
peace
we
have
now
completed
and
in
process
of
construction
but
four
firstclass
battle
ships
and
but
few
torpedo
boats
if
we
are
to
have
a
navy
for
warlike
operations
offensive
and
defensive
we
certainly
ought
to
increase
both
the
number
of
battle
ships
and
torpedo
boats
the
manufacture
of
armor
requires
expensive
plants
and
the
aggregation
of
many
skilled
workmen
all
the
armor
necessary
to
complete
the
vessels
now
building
will
be
delivered
before
the
st
of
june
next
if
no
new
contracts
are
given
out
contractors
must
disband
their
workmen
and
their
plants
must
lie
idle
battle
ships
authorized
at
this
time
would
not
be
well
under
way
until
late
in
the
coming
fiscal
year
and
at
least
three
years
and
a
half
from
the
date
of
the
contract
would
be
required
for
their
completion
the
secretary
states
that
not
more
than
per
cent
of
the
cost
of
such
ships
need
be
included
in
the
appropriations
for
the
coming
year
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
the
construction
of
additional
battle
ships
and
torpedo
boats
the
secretary
recommends
the
manufacture
not
only
of
a
reserve
supply
of
ordnance
and
ordnance
material
for
ships
of
the
navy
but
also
a
supply
for
the
auxiliary
fleet
guns
and
their
appurtenances
should
be
provided
and
kept
on
hand
for
both
these
purposes
we
have
not
today
a
single
gun
that
could
be
put
upon
the
ships
paris
or
new
york
of
the
international
navigation
company
or
any
other
ship
of
our
reserve
navy
the
manufacture
of
guns
at
the
washington
navyyard
is
proceeding
satisfactorily
and
none
of
our
new
ships
will
be
required
to
wait
for
their
guns
or
ordnance
equipment
an
important
order
has
been
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
coordi
nating
the
duties
of
the
several
bureaus
concerned
in
the
construction
of
ships
this
order
it
is
believed
will
secure
to
a
greater
extent
than
has
heretofore
been
possible
the
harmonious
action
of
these
several
bureaus
and
make
the
attainment
of
the
best
results
more
certain
during
the
past
fiscal
year
there
has
been
an
unusual
and
pressing
demand
in
many
quarters
of
the
world
for
the
presence
of
vessels
to
guard
american
interests
in
january
last
during
the
brazilian
insurrection
a
large
fleet
was
concentrated
in
the
harbor
of
rio
de
janeiro
the
vigorous
action
of
rearadmiral
benham
in
protecting
the
personal
and
commercial
rights
of
our
citizens
during
the
disturbed
conditions
afforded
results
which
will
it
is
believed
have
a
farreaching
and
wholesome
influence
whenever
in
like
circumstances
it
may
become
necessary
for
our
naval
commanders
to
interfere
on
behalf
of
our
people
in
foreign
ports
the
war
now
in
progress
between
china
and
japan
has
rendered
it
necessary
or
expedient
to
dispatch
eight
vessels
to
those
waters
both
the
secretary
of
the
navy
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
recommend
the
transfer
of
the
work
of
the
coast
survey
proper
to
the
navy
department
i
heartily
concur
in
this
recommendation
excluding
alaska
and
a
very
small
area
besides
all
the
work
of
mapping
and
charting
our
coasts
has
been
completed
the
hydrographic
work
which
must
be
done
over
and
over
again
by
reason
of
the
shifting
and
varying
depths
of
water
consequent
upon
the
action
of
streams
and
tides
has
heretofore
been
done
under
the
direction
of
naval
officers
in
subordination
to
the
superintendent
of
the
coast
survey
there
seems
to
be
no
good
reason
why
the
navy
should
not
have
entire
charge
hereafter
of
such
work
especially
as
the
hydrographic
office
of
the
navy
department
is
now
and
has
been
for
many
years
engaged
in
making
efficient
maps
entirely
similar
to
those
prepared
by
the
coast
survey
i
feel
it
my
imperative
duty
to
call
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
in
regard
to
the
personnel
of
the
line
of
the
navy
the
stagnation
of
promotion
in
this
the
vital
branch
of
the
service
is
so
great
as
to
seriously
impair
its
efficiency
i
consider
it
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
young
and
middleaged
officers
should
before
the
eve
of
retirement
be
permitted
to
reach
a
grade
entitling
them
to
active
and
important
duty
the
system
adopted
a
few
years
ago
regulating
the
employment
of
labor
at
the
navyyards
is
rigidly
upheld
and
has
fully
demonstrated
its
usefulness
and
expediency
it
is
within
the
domain
of
civilservice
reform
inasmuch
as
workmen
are
employed
through
a
board
of
labor
selected
at
each
navyyard
and
are
given
work
without
reference
to
politics
and
in
the
order
of
their
application
preference
however
being
given
to
army
and
navy
veterans
and
those
having
former
navyyard
experience
amendments
suggested
by
experience
have
been
made
to
the
rules
regulating
the
system
through
its
operation
the
work
at
our
navyyards
has
been
vastly
improved
in
efficiency
and
the
opportunity
to
work
has
been
honestly
and
fairly
awarded
to
willing
and
competent
applicants
it
is
hoped
that
if
this
system
continues
to
be
strictly
adhered
to
there
will
soon
be
as
a
natural
consequence
such
an
equalization
of
party
benefit
as
will
remove
all
temptation
to
relax
or
abandon
it
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
exhibits
the
situation
of
the
numerous
and
interesting
branches
of
the
public
service
connected
with
his
department
i
commend
this
report
and
the
valuable
recommendations
of
the
secretary
to
the
careful
attention
of
the
congress
the
public
land
disposed
of
during
the
year
amounted
to
acres
including
of
indian
lands
it
is
estimated
that
the
public
domain
still
remaining
amounts
to
a
little
more
than
acres
including
however
about
acres
in
alaska
as
well
as
military
reservations
and
railroad
and
other
selections
of
lands
yet
unadjudicated
the
total
cash
receipts
from
sale
of
lands
amounted
to
including
received
for
indian
lands
thirtyfive
thousand
patents
were
issued
for
agricultural
lands
and
patents
were
issued
to
indians
on
allotments
of
their
holdings
in
severalty
the
land
so
allotted
being
inalienable
by
the
indian
allottees
for
a
period
of
twentyfive
years
after
patent
there
were
certified
and
patented
on
account
of
railroad
and
wagonroad
grants
during
the
year
acres
of
land
and
at
the
close
of
the
year
acres
were
embraced
in
the
lists
of
selections
made
by
railroad
and
wagonroad
companies
and
awaited
settlement
the
selections
of
swamp
lands
and
that
taken
as
indemnity
therefor
since
the
passage
of
the
act
providing
for
the
same
in
amount
to
nearly
or
quite
acres
of
which
have
been
patented
to
states
about
acres
were
patented
during
the
last
year
nearly
acres
of
school
and
education
grants
were
approved
during
the
year
and
at
its
close
acres
remained
unadjusted
it
appears
that
the
appropriation
for
the
current
year
on
account
of
special
service
for
the
protection
of
the
public
lands
and
the
timber
thereon
is
much
less
than
those
for
previous
years
and
inadequate
for
an
efficient
performance
of
the
work
a
larger
sum
of
money
than
has
been
appropriated
during
a
number
of
years
past
on
this
account
has
been
returned
to
the
government
as
a
result
of
the
labors
of
those
employed
in
the
particular
service
mentioned
and
i
hope
it
will
not
be
crippled
by
insufficient
appropriation
i
fully
indorse
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
that
adequate
protection
be
provided
for
our
forest
reserves
and
that
a
comprehensive
forestry
system
be
inaugurated
such
keepers
and
superintendents
as
are
necessary
to
protect
the
forests
already
reserved
should
be
provided
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
there
should
be
an
abandonment
of
the
policy
sanctioned
by
present
laws
under
which
the
government
for
a
very
small
consideration
is
rapidly
losing
title
to
immense
tracts
of
land
covered
with
timber
which
should
be
properly
reserved
as
permanent
sources
of
timber
supply
the
suggestion
that
a
change
be
made
in
the
manner
of
securing
surveys
of
the
public
lands
is
especially
worthy
of
consideration
i
am
satisfied
that
these
surveys
should
be
made
by
a
corps
of
competent
surveyors
under
the
immediate
control
and
direction
of
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
an
exceedingly
important
recommendation
of
the
secretary
relates
to
the
manner
in
which
contests
and
litigated
cases
growing
out
of
efforts
to
obtain
government
land
are
determined
the
entire
testimony
upon
which
these
controversies
depend
in
all
their
stages
is
taken
before
the
local
registers
and
receivers
and
yet
these
officers
have
no
power
to
subpoena
witnesses
or
to
enforce
their
attendance
to
testify
these
cases
numbering
three
or
four
thousand
annually
are
sent
by
the
local
officers
to
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
for
his
action
the
exigencies
of
his
other
duties
oblige
him
to
act
upon
the
decisions
of
the
registers
and
receivers
without
an
opportunity
of
thorough
personal
examination
nearly
of
these
cases
are
appealed
annually
from
the
commissioner
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
burdened
with
other
important
administrative
duties
his
determination
of
these
appeals
must
be
almost
perfunctory
and
based
upon
the
examination
of
others
though
this
determination
of
the
secretary
operates
as
a
final
adjudication
upon
rights
of
very
great
importance
i
concur
in
the
opinion
that
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
should
be
relieved
from
the
duty
of
deciding
litigated
land
cases
that
a
nonpartisan
court
should
be
created
to
pass
on
such
cases
and
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
should
be
final
at
least
so
far
as
the
decisions
of
the
department
are
now
final
the
proposed
court
might
be
given
authority
to
certify
questions
of
law
in
matters
of
especial
importance
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
decision
the
creation
of
such
a
tribunal
would
expedite
the
disposal
of
cases
and
insure
decisions
of
a
more
satisfactory
character
the
registers
and
receivers
who
originally
hear
and
decide
these
disputes
should
be
invested
with
authority
to
compel
witnesses
to
attend
and
testify
before
them
though
the
condition
of
the
indians
shows
a
steady
and
healthy
progress
their
situation
is
not
satisfactory
at
all
points
some
of
them
to
whom
allotments
of
land
have
been
made
are
found
to
be
unable
or
disinclined
to
follow
agricultural
pursuits
or
to
otherwise
beneficially
manage
their
land
this
is
especially
true
of
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
who
as
it
appears
by
reports
of
their
agent
have
in
many
instances
never
been
located
upon
their
allotments
and
in
some
cases
do
not
even
know
where
their
allotments
are
their
condition
has
deteriorated
they
are
not
selfsupporting
and
they
live
in
camps
and
spend
their
time
in
idleness
i
have
always
believed
that
allotments
of
reservation
lands
to
indians
in
severalty
should
be
made
sparingly
or
at
least
slowly
and
with
the
utmost
caution
in
these
days
when
white
agriculturists
and
stock
raisers
of
experience
and
intelligence
find
their
lot
a
hard
one
we
ought
not
to
expect
indians
unless
far
advanced
in
civilization
and
habits
of
industry
to
support
themselves
on
the
small
tracts
of
land
usually
allotted
to
them
if
the
selfsupporting
scheme
by
allotment
fails
the
wretched
pauperism
of
the
allottees
which
results
is
worse
than
their
original
condition
of
regulated
dependence
it
is
evident
that
the
evil
consequences
of
illadvised
allotment
are
intensified
in
cases
where
the
false
step
can
not
be
retraced
on
account
of
the
purchase
by
the
government
of
reservation
lands
remaining
after
allotments
are
made
and
the
disposition
of
such
remaining
lands
to
settlers
or
purchasers
from
the
government
i
am
convinced
that
the
proper
solution
of
the
indian
problem
and
the
success
of
every
step
taken
in
that
direction
depend
to
a
very
large
extent
upon
the
intelligence
and
honesty
of
the
reservation
agents
and
the
interest
they
have
in
their
work
an
agent
fitted
for
his
place
can
do
much
towa
rd
preparing
the
indians
under
his
charge
for
citizenship
and
allotment
of
their
lands
and
his
advice
as
to
any
matter
concerning
their
welfare
will
not
mislead
an
unfit
agent
will
make
no
effort
to
advance
the
indians
on
his
reservation
toward
civilization
or
preparation
for
allotment
of
lands
in
severalty
and
his
opinion
as
to
their
condition
in
this
and
other
regards
is
heedless
and
valueless
the
indications
are
that
the
detail
of
army
officers
as
indian
agents
will
result
in
improved
management
on
the
reservations
whenever
allotments
are
made
and
any
indian
on
the
reservation
has
previously
settled
upon
a
lot
and
cultivated
it
or
shown
a
disposition
to
improve
it
in
any
way
such
lot
should
certainly
be
allotted
to
him
and
this
should
be
made
plainly
obligatory
by
statute
in
the
light
of
experience
and
considering
the
uncertainty
of
the
indian
situation
and
its
exigencies
in
the
future
i
am
not
only
disposed
to
be
very
cautious
in
making
allotments
but
i
incline
to
agree
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
opinion
that
when
allotments
are
made
the
balance
of
reservation
land
remaining
after
allotment
instead
of
being
bought
by
the
government
from
the
indians
and
opened
for
settlement
with
such
scandals
and
unfair
practices
as
seem
unavoidable
should
remain
for
a
time
at
least
as
common
land
or
be
sold
by
the
government
on
behalf
of
the
indians
in
an
orderly
way
and
at
fixed
prices
to
be
determined
by
its
location
and
desirability
and
that
the
proceeds
less
expenses
should
be
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
indian
proprietors
the
intelligent
indianschool
management
of
the
past
year
has
been
followed
by
gratifying
results
efforts
have
been
made
to
advance
the
work
in
a
sound
and
practical
manner
five
institutes
of
indian
teachers
have
been
held
during
the
year
and
have
proved
very
beneficial
through
the
views
exchanged
and
methods
discussed
particularly
applicable
to
indian
education
efforts
are
being
made
in
the
direction
of
a
gradual
reduction
of
the
number
of
indian
contract
schools
so
that
in
a
comparatively
short
time
they
may
give
way
altogether
to
government
schools
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
change
may
be
so
gradual
as
to
be
perfected
without
too
great
expense
to
the
government
or
undue
disregard
of
investments
made
by
those
who
have
established
and
are
maintaining
such
contract
schools
the
appropriation
for
the
current
year
ending
june
applicable
to
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
indian
service
amounts
to
being
less
by
than
the
sum
appropriated
on
the
same
account
for
the
previous
year
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
on
the
th
day
of
june
there
were
persons
on
our
pension
rolls
being
a
net
increase
of
over
the
number
reported
at
the
end
of
the
previous
year
these
pensioners
may
be
classified
as
follows
soldiers
and
sailors
survivors
of
all
wars
widows
and
relatives
of
deceased
soldiers
army
nurses
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
of
these
pensioners
are
surviving
soldiers
of
indian
and
other
wars
prior
to
the
late
civil
war
and
the
widows
or
relatives
of
such
soldiers
the
remainder
numbering
are
receiving
pensions
on
account
of
the
rebellion
and
of
these
are
on
the
rolls
under
the
authority
of
the
act
of
june
sometimes
called
the
dependentpension
law
the
total
amount
expended
for
pensions
during
the
year
was
leaving
an
unexpended
balance
from
the
sum
appropriated
of
the
sum
necessary
to
meet
pension
expenditures
for
the
year
ending
june
is
estimated
at
the
commissioner
of
pensions
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
year
being
the
thirtieth
after
the
close
of
the
war
of
the
rebellion
must
according
to
all
sensible
human
calculation
see
the
highest
limit
of
the
pension
roll
and
that
after
that
year
it
must
begin
to
decline
the
claims
pending
in
the
bureau
have
decreased
more
than
during
the
year
a
large
proportion
of
the
new
claims
filed
are
for
increase
of
pension
by
those
now
on
the
rolls
the
number
of
certificates
issued
was
the
names
dropped
from
the
rolls
for
all
causes
during
the
year
numbered
among
our
pensioners
are
widows
and
daughters
of
soldiers
of
the
revolution
and
survivors
of
the
war
of
the
barefaced
and
extensive
pension
frauds
exposed
under
the
direction
of
the
courageous
and
generous
veteran
soldier
now
at
the
head
of
the
bureau
leave
no
room
for
the
claim
that
no
purgation
of
our
pension
rolls
was
needed
or
that
continued
vigilance
and
prompt
action
are
not
necessary
to
the
same
end
the
accusation
that
an
effort
to
detect
pension
frauds
is
evidence
of
unfriendliness
toward
our
worthy
veterans
and
a
denial
of
their
claims
to
the
generosity
of
the
government
suggests
an
unfortunate
indifference
to
the
commission
of
any
offense
which
has
for
its
motive
the
securing
of
a
pension
and
indicates
a
willingness
to
be
blind
to
the
existence
of
mean
and
treacherous
crimes
which
play
upon
demagogic
fears
and
make
sport
of
the
patriotic
impulse
of
a
grateful
people
the
completion
of
the
eleventh
census
is
now
in
charge
of
the
commissioner
of
labor
the
total
disbursements
on
account
of
the
work
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
amounted
to
at
the
close
of
the
year
the
number
of
persons
employed
in
the
census
office
was
at
present
there
are
about
the
whole
number
of
volumes
necessary
to
comprehend
the
eleventh
census
will
be
and
they
will
contain
printed
pages
the
assurance
is
confidently
made
that
before
the
close
of
the
present
calendar
year
the
material
still
incomplete
will
be
practically
in
hand
and
the
census
can
certainly
be
closed
by
the
th
of
march
after
that
the
revision
and
proof
reading
necessary
to
bring
out
the
volumes
will
still
be
required
the
text
of
the
census
volumes
has
been
limited
as
far
as
possible
to
the
analysis
of
the
statistics
presented
this
method
which
is
in
accordance
with
law
has
caused
more
or
less
friction
and
in
some
instances
individual
disappointment
for
when
the
commissioner
of
labor
took
charge
of
the
work
he
found
much
matter
on
hand
which
according
to
this
rule
he
was
compelled
to
discard
the
census
is
being
prepared
according
to
the
theory
that
it
is
designed
to
collect
facts
and
certify
them
to
the
public
not
to
elaborate
arguments
or
to
present
personal
views
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
his
report
reviews
the
operations
of
his
department
for
the
last
fiscal
year
and
makes
recommendations
for
the
further
extension
of
its
usefulness
he
reports
a
saving
in
expenditures
during
the
year
of
which
is
covered
back
into
the
treasury
this
sum
is
per
cent
of
the
entire
appropriation
a
special
study
has
been
made
of
the
demand
for
american
farm
products
in
all
foreign
markets
especially
great
britain
that
country
received
from
the
united
states
during
the
nine
months
ending
september
live
beef
cattle
valued
at
as
against
cattle
valued
at
during
the
same
period
for
during
the
first
six
months
of
the
united
kingdom
took
also
pounds
of
dressed
beef
from
the
united
states
valued
at
nearly
the
report
shows
that
during
the
nine
months
immediately
preceding
september
the
united
states
exported
to
great
britain
pounds
of
pork
of
apples
bushels
valued
at
and
of
horses
at
an
average
value
of
per
head
there
was
a
falling
off
in
american
wheat
exports
of
bushels
and
the
secretary
is
inclined
to
believe
that
wheat
may
not
in
the
future
be
the
staple
export
cereal
product
of
our
country
but
that
corn
will
continue
to
advance
in
importance
as
an
export
on
account
of
the
new
uses
to
which
it
is
constantly
being
appropriated
the
exports
of
agricultural
products
from
the
united
states
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
amounted
to
being
per
cent
of
american
exports
of
every
description
and
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
took
more
than
per
cent
of
all
farm
products
finding
foreign
markets
the
department
of
agriculture
has
undertaken
during
the
year
two
new
and
important
lines
of
research
the
first
relates
to
grasses
and
forage
plants
with
the
purpose
of
instructing
and
familiarizing
the
people
as
to
the
distinctive
grasses
of
the
united
states
and
teaching
them
how
to
introduce
valuable
foreign
forage
plants
which
may
be
adapted
to
this
country
the
second
relates
to
agricultural
soils
and
crop
production
involving
the
analyses
of
samples
of
soils
from
all
sections
of
the
american
union
to
demonstrate
their
adaptability
to
particular
plants
and
crops
mechanical
analyses
of
soils
may
be
of
such
inestimable
utility
that
it
is
foremost
in
the
new
lines
of
agricultural
research
and
the
secretary
therefore
recommends
that
a
division
having
it
in
charge
be
permanently
established
in
the
department
the
amount
appropriated
for
the
weather
bureau
was
of
that
sum
or
per
cent
has
been
saved
and
is
returned
to
the
treasury
as
illustrating
the
usefulness
of
this
service
it
may
be
here
stated
that
the
warnings
which
were
very
generally
given
of
two
tropical
storms
occurring
in
september
and
october
of
the
present
year
resulted
in
detaining
safely
in
port
vessels
valued
at
laden
with
cargoes
of
probably
still
greater
value
what
is
much
more
important
and
gratifying
many
human
lives
on
these
ships
were
also
undoubtedly
saved
the
appropriation
to
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
was
and
the
expenditures
for
the
year
were
only
thus
leaving
unexpended
the
inspection
of
beef
animals
for
export
and
interstate
trade
has
been
continued
and
head
were
inspected
during
the
year
at
a
cost
of
cents
per
head
against
cents
for
the
amount
of
pork
microscopically
examined
was
pounds
against
pounds
in
the
preceding
year
the
cost
of
this
inspection
has
been
diminished
from
cents
per
head
in
to
cents
in
the
expense
of
inspecting
the
pork
sold
in
to
germany
and
france
by
the
united
states
was
the
quantity
inspected
was
greater
by
pounds
than
during
the
preceding
year
when
the
cost
of
such
inspection
was
the
secretary
of
agriculture
recommends
that
the
law
providing
for
the
microscopic
inspection
of
export
and
interstate
meat
be
so
amended
as
to
compel
owners
of
the
meat
inspected
to
pay
the
cost
of
such
inspection
and
i
call
attention
to
the
arguments
presented
in
his
report
in
support
of
this
recommendation
the
live
be
ef
cattle
exported
and
tagged
during
the
year
numbered
this
is
an
increase
of
head
over
the
previous
year
the
sanitary
inspection
of
cattle
shipped
to
europe
has
cost
an
average
of
cents
for
each
animal
and
the
cost
of
inspecting
southern
cattle
and
the
disinfection
of
cars
and
stock
yards
averages
cents
per
animal
the
scientific
inquiries
of
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
have
progressed
steadily
during
the
year
much
tuberculin
and
mallein
have
been
furnished
to
state
authorities
for
use
in
the
agricultural
colleges
and
experiment
stations
for
the
treatment
of
tuberculosis
and
glanders
quite
recently
this
department
has
published
the
results
of
its
investigations
of
bovine
tuberculosis
and
its
researches
will
be
vigorously
continued
certain
herds
in
the
district
of
columbia
will
be
thoroughly
inspected
and
will
probably
supply
adequate
scope
for
the
department
to
intelligently
prosecute
its
scientific
work
and
furnish
sufficient
material
for
purposes
of
illustration
description
and
definition
the
sterilization
of
milk
suspected
of
containing
the
bacilli
of
tuberculosis
has
been
during
the
year
very
thoroughly
explained
in
a
leaflet
by
dr
d
e
salmon
the
chief
of
the
bureau
and
given
general
circulation
throughout
the
country
the
office
of
experiment
stations
which
is
a
part
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
has
during
the
past
year
engaged
itself
almost
wholly
in
preparing
for
publication
works
based
upon
the
reports
of
agricultural
experiment
stations
and
other
institutions
for
agricultural
inquiry
in
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries
the
secretary
in
his
report
for
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
appropriations
made
for
the
support
of
the
experiment
stations
throughout
the
union
were
the
only
moneys
taken
out
of
the
national
treasury
by
act
of
congress
for
which
no
accounting
to
federal
authorities
was
required
responding
to
this
suggestion
the
fiftythird
congress
in
making
the
appropriation
for
the
department
for
the
present
fiscal
year
provided
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
shall
prescribe
the
form
of
annual
financial
statement
required
by
section
of
said
act
of
march
shall
ascertain
whether
the
expenditures
under
the
appropriation
hereby
made
are
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
said
act
and
shall
make
report
thereon
to
congress
in
obedience
to
this
law
the
department
of
agriculture
immediately
sent
out
blank
forms
of
expense
accounts
to
each
station
and
proposes
in
addition
to
make
through
trusted
experts
systematic
examination
of
the
several
stations
during
each
year
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
by
personal
investigation
the
detailed
information
necessary
to
enable
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
make
as
the
statute
provides
a
satisfactory
report
to
congress
the
boards
of
management
of
the
several
stations
with
great
alacrity
and
cordiality
have
approved
the
amendment
to
the
law
providing
this
supervision
of
their
expenditures
anticipating
that
it
will
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
stations
and
protect
their
directors
and
managers
from
loose
charges
concerning
their
use
of
public
funds
besides
bringing
the
department
of
agriculture
into
closer
and
more
confidential
relations
with
the
experimental
stations
and
through
their
joint
service
largely
increasing
their
usefulness
to
the
agriculture
of
the
country
acting
upon
a
recommendation
contained
in
the
report
of
congress
appropriated
to
enable
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
investigate
and
report
upon
the
nutritive
value
of
the
various
articles
and
commodities
used
for
human
food
with
special
suggestions
of
full
wholesome
and
edible
rations
less
wasteful
and
more
economical
than
those
in
common
use
under
this
appropriation
the
department
has
prepared
and
now
has
nearly
ready
for
distribution
an
elementary
discussion
of
the
nutritive
value
and
pecuniary
economy
of
food
when
we
consider
that
fully
onehalf
of
all
the
money
earned
by
the
wage
earners
of
the
civilized
world
is
expended
by
them
for
food
the
importance
and
utility
of
such
an
investigation
is
apparent
the
department
expended
in
the
fiscal
year
and
out
of
that
sum
the
total
amount
expended
in
scientific
research
was
per
cent
but
in
the
year
ending
june
out
of
a
total
expenditure
of
the
department
applied
per
cent
of
that
sum
to
scientific
work
and
investigation
it
is
therefore
very
plainly
observable
that
the
economies
which
have
been
practiced
in
the
administration
of
the
department
have
not
been
at
the
expense
of
scientific
research
the
recommendation
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
for
that
the
vicious
system
of
promiscuous
free
distribution
of
its
departmental
documents
be
abandoned
is
again
urged
these
publications
may
well
be
furnished
without
cost
to
public
libraries
educational
institutions
and
the
officers
and
libraries
of
states
and
of
the
federal
government
but
from
all
individuals
applying
for
them
a
price
covering
the
cost
of
the
document
asked
for
should
be
required
thus
the
publications
and
documents
would
be
secured
by
those
who
really
desire
them
for
proper
purposes
half
a
million
of
copies
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
are
printed
for
distribution
at
an
annual
cost
of
about
large
numbers
of
them
are
cumbering
storerooms
at
the
capitol
and
the
shelves
of
secondhandbook
stores
throughout
the
country
all
this
labor
and
waste
might
be
avoided
if
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
were
adopted
the
secretary
also
again
recommends
that
the
gratuitous
distribution
of
seeds
cease
and
that
no
money
be
appropriated
for
that
purpose
except
to
experiment
stations
he
reiterates
the
reasons
given
in
his
report
for
for
discontinuing
this
unjustifiable
gratuity
and
i
fully
concur
in
the
conclusions
which
he
has
reached
the
best
service
of
the
statistician
of
the
department
of
agriculture
is
the
ascertainment
by
diligence
and
care
of
the
actual
and
real
conditions
favorable
or
unfavorable
of
the
farmers
and
farms
of
the
country
and
to
seek
the
causes
which
produce
these
conditions
to
the
end
that
the
facts
ascertained
may
guide
their
intelligent
treatment
a
further
important
utility
in
agricultural
statistics
is
found
in
their
elucidation
of
the
relation
of
the
supply
of
farm
products
to
the
demand
for
them
in
the
markets
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
world
it
is
deemed
possible
that
an
agricultural
census
may
be
taken
each
year
through
the
agents
of
the
statistical
division
of
the
department
such
a
course
is
commended
for
trial
by
the
chief
of
that
division
its
scope
would
be
the
area
under
each
of
the
more
important
crops
the
aggregate
products
of
each
of
such
crops
the
quantity
of
wheat
and
corn
in
the
hands
of
farmers
at
a
date
after
the
spring
sowings
and
plantings
and
before
the
beginning
of
harvest
and
also
the
quantity
of
cotton
and
tobacco
remaining
in
the
hands
of
planters
either
at
the
same
date
or
at
some
other
designated
time
the
cost
of
the
work
is
estimated
at
owing
to
the
peculiar
quality
of
the
statisticians
work
and
the
natural
and
acquired
fitness
necessary
to
its
successful
prosecution
the
secretary
of
agriculture
expresses
the
opinion
that
every
person
employed
in
gathering
statistics
under
the
chief
of
that
division
should
be
admitted
to
that
service
only
after
a
thorough
exhaustive
and
successful
examination
at
the
hands
of
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
this
has
led
him
to
call
for
such
examination
of
candidates
for
the
position
of
assistant
statisticians
and
also
of
candidates
for
chiefs
of
sections
in
that
division
the
work
done
by
the
department
of
agriculture
is
very
superficially
dealt
with
in
this
communication
and
i
commend
the
report
of
the
secretary
and
the
very
important
interests
with
which
it
deals
to
the
careful
attention
of
the
congress
the
advantages
to
the
public
service
of
an
adherence
to
the
principles
of
civilservice
reform
are
constantly
more
apparent
and
nothing
is
so
encouraging
to
those
in
official
life
who
honestly
desire
good
government
as
the
increasing
appreciation
by
our
people
of
these
advantages
a
vast
majority
of
the
voters
of
the
land
are
ready
to
insist
that
the
time
and
attention
of
those
they
select
to
perform
for
them
important
public
duties
should
not
be
distracted
by
doling
out
minor
offices
and
they
are
growing
to
be
unanimous
in
regarding
party
organization
as
something
that
should
be
used
in
establishing
party
principles
instead
of
dictating
the
distribution
of
public
places
as
rewards
of
partisan
activity
numerous
additional
offices
and
places
have
lately
been
brought
within
civilservice
rules
and
regulations
and
some
others
will
probably
soon
be
included
the
report
of
the
commissioners
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
and
i
invite
careful
attention
to
the
recommendations
it
contains
i
am
entirely
convinced
that
we
ought
not
to
be
longer
without
a
national
board
of
health
or
national
health
officer
charged
with
no
other
duties
than
such
as
pertain
to
the
protection
of
our
country
from
the
invasion
of
pestilence
and
disease
this
would
involve
the
establishment
by
such
board
or
officer
of
proper
quarantine
precautions
or
the
necessary
aid
and
counsel
to
local
authorities
on
the
subject
prompt
advice
and
assistance
to
local
boards
of
health
or
health
officers
in
the
suppression
of
contagious
disease
and
in
cases
where
there
are
no
such
local
boards
or
officers
the
immediate
direction
by
the
national
board
or
officer
of
measures
of
suppression
constant
and
authentic
information
concerning
the
health
of
foreign
countries
and
all
parts
of
our
own
country
as
related
to
contagious
diseases
and
consideration
of
regulations
to
be
enforced
in
foreign
ports
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
contagion
into
our
cities
and
the
measures
which
should
be
adopted
to
secure
their
enforcement
there
seems
to
be
at
this
time
a
decided
inclination
to
discuss
measures
of
protection
against
contagious
diseases
in
international
conference
with
a
view
of
adopting
means
of
mutual
assistance
the
creation
of
such
a
national
health
establishment
would
greatly
aid
our
standing
in
such
confer
ences
and
improve
our
opportunities
to
avail
ourselves
of
their
benefits
i
earnestly
recommend
the
inauguration
of
a
national
board
of
health
or
similar
national
instrumentality
believing
the
same
to
be
a
needed
precaution
against
contagious
disease
and
in
the
interest
of
the
safety
and
health
of
our
people
by
virtue
of
a
statute
of
the
united
states
passed
in
i
appointed
in
july
last
hon
john
d
kernan
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
hon
nicholas
e
worthington
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
form
with
hon
carroll
d
wright
commissioner
of
labor
who
was
designated
by
said
statute
a
commission
for
the
purpose
of
making
careful
inquiry
into
the
causes
of
the
controversies
between
certain
railroads
and
their
employees
which
had
resulted
in
an
extensive
and
destructive
strike
accompanied
by
much
violence
and
dangerous
disturbance
with
considerable
loss
of
life
and
great
destruction
of
property
the
report
of
the
commissioners
has
been
submitted
to
me
and
will
be
transmitted
to
the
congress
with
the
evidence
taken
upon
their
investigation
their
work
has
been
well
done
and
their
standing
and
intelligence
give
assurance
that
the
report
and
suggestions
they
make
are
worthy
of
careful
consideration
the
tariff
act
passed
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
needs
important
amendments
if
it
is
to
be
executed
effectively
and
with
certainty
in
addition
to
such
necessary
amendments
as
will
not
change
rates
of
duty
i
am
still
very
decidedly
in
favor
of
putting
coal
and
iron
upon
the
free
list
so
far
as
the
sugar
schedule
is
concerned
i
would
be
glad
under
existing
aggravations
to
see
every
particle
of
differential
duty
in
favor
of
refined
sugar
stricken
out
of
our
tariff
law
if
with
all
the
favor
now
accorded
the
sugarrefining
interest
in
our
tariff
laws
it
still
languishes
to
the
extent
of
closed
refineries
and
thousands
of
discharged
workmen
it
would
seem
to
present
a
hopeless
case
for
reasonable
legislative
aid
whatever
else
is
done
or
omitted
i
earnestly
repeat
here
the
recommendation
i
have
made
in
another
portion
of
this
communication
that
the
additional
duty
of
onetenth
of
a
cent
per
pound
laid
upon
sugar
imported
from
countries
paying
a
bounty
on
its
export
be
abrogated
it
seems
to
me
that
exceedingly
important
considerations
point
to
the
propriety
of
this
amendment
with
the
advent
of
a
new
tariff
policy
not
only
calculated
to
relieve
the
consumers
of
our
land
in
the
cost
of
their
daily
life
but
to
invite
a
better
development
of
american
thrift
and
create
for
us
closer
and
more
profitable
commercial
relations
with
the
rest
of
the
world
it
follows
as
a
logical
and
imperative
necessity
that
we
should
at
once
remove
the
chief
if
not
the
only
obstacle
which
has
so
long
prevented
our
participation
in
the
foreign
carrying
trade
of
the
sea
a
tariff
built
upon
the
theory
that
it
is
well
to
check
imports
and
that
a
home
market
should
bound
the
industry
and
effort
of
american
producers
was
fitly
supplemented
by
a
refusal
to
allow
american
registry
to
vessels
built
abroad
though
owned
and
navigated
by
our
people
thus
exhibiting
a
willingness
to
abandon
all
contest
for
the
advantages
of
american
transoceanic
carriage
our
new
tariff
policy
built
upon
the
theory
that
it
is
well
to
encourage
such
importations
as
our
people
need
and
that
our
products
and
manufactures
should
find
markets
in
every
part
of
the
habitable
globe
is
consistently
supplemented
by
the
greatest
possible
liberty
to
our
citizens
in
the
ownership
and
navigation
of
ships
in
which
our
products
and
manufactures
may
be
transported
the
millions
now
paid
to
foreigners
for
carrying
american
passengers
and
products
across
the
sea
should
be
turned
into
american
hands
shipbuilding
which
has
been
protected
to
strangulation
should
be
revived
by
the
prospect
of
profitable
employment
for
ships
when
built
and
the
american
sailor
should
be
resurrected
and
again
take
his
placea
sturdy
and
industrious
citizen
in
time
of
peace
and
a
patriotic
and
safe
defender
of
american
interests
in
the
day
of
conflict
the
ancient
provision
of
our
law
denying
american
registry
to
ships
built
abroad
and
owned
by
americans
appears
in
the
light
of
present
conditions
not
only
to
be
a
failure
for
good
at
every
point
but
to
be
nearer
a
relic
of
barbarism
than
anything
that
exists
under
the
permission
of
a
statute
of
the
united
states
i
earnestly
recommend
its
prompt
repeal
during
the
last
month
the
gold
reserved
in
the
treasury
for
the
purpose
of
redeeming
the
notes
of
the
government
circulating
as
money
in
the
hands
of
the
people
became
so
reduced
and
its
further
depletion
in
the
near
future
seemed
so
certain
that
in
the
exercise
of
proper
care
for
the
public
welfare
it
became
necessary
to
replenish
this
reserve
and
thus
maintain
popular
faith
in
the
ability
and
determination
of
the
government
to
meet
as
agreed
its
pecuniary
obligations
it
would
have
been
well
if
in
this
emergency
authority
had
existed
to
issue
the
bonds
of
the
government
bearing
a
low
rate
of
interest
and
maturing
within
a
short
period
but
the
congress
having
failed
to
confer
such
authority
resort
was
necessarily
had
to
the
resumption
act
of
and
pursuant
to
its
provisions
bonds
were
issued
drawing
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
per
annum
and
maturing
ten
years
after
their
issue
that
being
the
shortest
time
authorized
by
the
act
i
am
glad
to
say
however
that
on
the
sale
of
these
bonds
the
premium
received
operated
to
reduce
the
rate
of
interest
to
be
paid
by
the
government
to
less
than
per
cent
nothing
could
be
worse
or
further
removed
from
sensible
finance
than
the
relations
existing
between
the
currency
the
government
has
issued
the
gold
held
for
its
redemption
and
the
means
which
must
be
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
replenishing
such
redemption
fund
when
impaired
even
if
the
claims
upon
this
fund
were
confined
to
the
obligations
originally
intended
and
if
the
redemption
of
these
obligations
meant
their
cancellation
the
fund
would
be
very
small
but
these
obligations
when
received
and
redeemed
in
gold
are
not
canceled
but
are
reissued
and
may
do
duty
many
times
by
way
of
drawing
gold
from
the
treasury
thus
we
have
an
endless
chain
in
operation
constantly
depleting
the
treasurys
gold
and
never
near
a
final
rest
as
if
this
was
not
bad
enough
we
have
by
a
statutory
declaration
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
government
to
maintain
the
parity
between
gold
and
silver
aided
the
force
and
momentum
of
this
exhausting
process
and
added
largely
to
the
currency
obligations
claiming
this
peculiar
gold
redemption
our
small
gold
reserve
is
thus
subject
to
drain
from
every
side
the
demands
that
increase
our
danger
also
increase
the
necessity
of
protecting
this
reserve
against
depletion
and
it
is
most
unsatisfactory
to
know
that
the
protection
afforded
is
only
a
temporary
palliation
it
is
perfectly
and
palpably
plain
that
the
only
way
under
present
conditions
by
which
this
reserve
when
dangerously
depleted
can
be
replenished
is
through
the
issue
and
sale
of
the
bonds
of
the
government
for
gold
and
yet
congress
has
not
only
thus
far
declined
to
authorize
the
issue
of
bonds
best
suited
to
such
a
purpose
but
there
seems
a
disposition
in
some
quarters
to
deny
both
the
necessity
and
power
for
the
issue
of
bonds
at
all
i
can
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
any
of
our
citizens
are
deliberately
willing
that
their
government
should
default
in
its
pecuniary
obligations
or
that
its
financial
operations
should
be
reduced
to
a
silver
basis
at
any
rate
i
should
not
feel
that
my
duty
was
done
if
i
omitted
any
effort
i
could
make
to
avert
such
a
calamity
as
long
therefore
as
no
provision
is
made
for
the
final
redemption
or
the
putting
aside
of
the
currency
obligation
now
used
to
repeatedly
and
constantly
draw
from
the
government
its
gold
and
as
long
as
no
better
authority
for
bond
issues
is
allowed
than
at
present
exists
such
authority
will
be
utilized
whenever
and
as
often
as
it
becomes
necessary
to
maintain
a
sufficient
gold
reserve
and
in
abundant
time
to
save
the
credit
of
our
country
and
make
good
the
financial
declarations
of
our
government
questions
relating
to
our
banks
and
currency
are
closely
connected
with
the
subject
just
referred
to
and
they
also
present
some
unsatisfactory
features
prominent
among
them
are
the
lack
of
elasticity
in
our
currency
circulation
and
its
frequent
concentration
in
financial
centers
when
it
is
most
needed
in
other
parts
of
the
country
the
absolute
divorcement
of
the
government
from
the
business
of
banking
is
the
ideal
relationship
of
the
government
to
the
circulation
of
the
currency
of
the
country
this
condition
can
not
be
immediately
reached
but
as
a
step
in
that
direction
and
as
a
means
of
securing
a
more
elastic
currency
and
obviating
other
objections
to
the
present
arrangement
of
bank
circulation
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
presents
in
his
report
a
scheme
modifying
present
banking
laws
and
providing
for
the
issue
of
circulating
notes
by
state
banks
free
from
taxation
under
certain
limitations
the
secretary
explains
his
plan
so
plainly
and
its
advantages
are
developed
by
him
with
such
remarkable
clearness
that
any
effort
on
my
part
to
present
argument
in
its
support
would
be
superfluous
i
shall
therefore
content
myself
with
an
unqualified
indorsement
of
the
secretarys
proposed
changes
in
the
law
and
a
brief
and
imperfect
statement
of
their
prominent
features
it
is
proposed
to
repeal
all
laws
providing
for
the
deposit
of
united
states
bonds
as
security
for
circulation
to
permit
national
banks
to
issue
circulating
notes
not
exceeding
in
amount
per
cent
of
their
paidup
and
unimpaired
capital
provided
they
deposit
with
the
government
as
a
guaranty
fund
in
united
states
legaltender
notes
including
treasury
notes
of
a
sum
equal
in
amount
to
per
cent
of
the
notes
they
desire
to
issue
this
deposit
to
be
maintained
at
all
times
but
whenever
any
bank
retires
any
part
of
its
circulation
a
proportional
part
of
its
guaranty
fund
shall
be
returned
to
it
to
permit
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
prepare
and
keep
on
hand
ready
for
issue
in
case
a
n
increase
in
circulation
is
desired
blank
nationalbank
notes
for
each
bank
having
circulation
and
to
repeal
the
provisions
of
the
present
law
imposing
limitations
and
restrictions
upon
banks
desiring
to
reduce
or
increase
their
circulation
thus
permitting
such
increase
or
reduction
within
the
limit
of
per
cent
of
capital
to
be
quickly
made
as
emergencies
arise
in
addition
to
the
guaranty
fund
required
it
is
proposed
to
provide
a
safety
fund
for
the
immediate
redemption
of
the
circulating
notes
of
failed
banks
by
imposing
a
small
annual
tax
say
onehalf
of
per
cent
upon
the
average
circulation
of
each
bank
until
the
fund
amounts
to
per
cent
of
the
total
circulation
outstanding
when
a
bank
fails
its
guaranty
fund
is
to
be
paid
into
this
safety
fund
and
its
notes
are
to
be
redeemed
in
the
first
instance
from
such
safety
fund
thus
augmented
any
impairment
of
such
fund
caused
thereby
to
be
made
good
from
the
immediately
available
cash
assets
of
said
bank
and
if
these
should
be
insufficient
such
impairment
to
be
made
good
by
pro
rata
assessment
among
the
other
banks
their
contributions
constituting
a
first
lien
upon
the
assets
of
the
failed
bank
in
favor
of
the
contributing
banks
as
a
further
security
it
is
contemplated
that
the
existing
provision
fixing
the
individual
liability
of
stockholders
is
to
be
retained
and
the
banks
indebtedness
on
account
of
its
circulating
notes
is
to
be
made
a
first
lien
on
all
its
assets
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
expense
of
printing
notes
official
supervision
cancellation
and
other
like
charges
there
shall
be
imposed
a
tax
of
say
onehalf
of
per
cent
per
annum
upon
the
average
amount
of
notes
in
circulation
it
is
further
provided
that
there
shall
be
no
nationalbank
notes
issued
of
a
less
denomination
than
that
each
national
bank
except
in
case
of
a
failed
bank
shall
redeem
or
retire
its
notes
in
the
first
instance
at
its
own
office
or
at
agencies
to
be
designated
by
it
and
that
no
fixed
reserve
need
be
maintained
on
account
of
deposits
another
very
important
feature
of
this
plan
is
the
exemption
of
state
banks
from
taxation
by
the
united
states
in
cases
where
it
is
shown
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
comptroller
of
the
currency
by
banks
claiming
such
exemption
that
they
have
not
had
outstanding
their
circulating
notes
exceeding
per
cent
of
their
paidup
and
unimpaired
capital
that
their
stockholders
are
individually
liable
for
the
redemption
of
their
circulating
notes
to
the
full
extent
of
their
ownership
of
stock
that
the
liability
of
said
banks
upon
their
circulating
notes
constitutes
under
their
state
law
a
first
lien
upon
their
assets
that
such
banks
have
kept
and
maintained
a
guaranty
fund
in
united
states
legaltender
notes
including
treasury
notes
of
equal
to
per
cent
of
their
outstanding
circulating
notes
and
that
such
banks
have
promptly
redeemed
their
circulating
notes
when
presented
at
their
principal
or
branch
offices
it
is
quite
likely
that
this
scheme
may
be
usefully
amended
in
some
of
its
details
but
i
am
satisfied
it
furnishes
a
basis
for
a
very
great
improvement
in
our
present
banking
and
currency
system
i
conclude
this
communication
fully
appreciating
that
the
responsibility
for
all
legislation
affecting
the
people
of
the
united
states
rests
upon
their
representatives
in
the
congress
and
assuring
them
that
whether
in
accordance
with
recommendations
i
have
made
or
not
i
shall
be
glad
to
cooperate
in
perfecting
any
legislation

to
the
congress
of
the

the
constitutional
duty
which
requires
the
president
from
time
to
time
to
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the

and
recommend
to
their
consideration
such
measures
as

is
fittingly
entered
upon
by
commending
to
the

a
careful
examination
of
the
detailed
statements
and
wellsupported
recommendations
contained
in
the
reports
of
the
heads
of
departments
who
are
chiefly
charged
with
the
executive
work
of
the

in
an
effort
to
abridge
this
communication
as
much
as
is
consistent
with
its
purpose
i
shall
supplement
a
brief
reference
to
the
contents
of
these
departmental
reports
by
the
mention
of
such
executive
business
and
incidents
as
are
not
embraced
therein
and
by
such
recommendations
as
appear
to
be
at
this
particular
time
appropriate
while
our
foreign
relations
have
not
at
all
times
during
the
past
year
been
entirely
free
from
perplexity
no
embarrassing
situation
remains
that
will
not
yield
to
the
spirit
of
fairness
and
love
of
justice
which
joined
with
consistent
firmness
characterize
a
truly
american
foreign
policy
my
predecessor
having
accepted
the
office
of
arbitrator
of
the
longstanding
missions
boundary
dispute
tendered
to
the
president
by
the
argentine
republic
and
brazil
it
has
been
my
agreeable
duty
to
receive
the
special
envoys
commissioned
by
those
states
to
lay
before
me
evidence
and
arguments
in
behalf
of
their
respective
governments
the
outbreak
of
domestic
hostilities
in
the
republic
of
brazil
found
the
united
states
alert
to
watch
the
interests
of
our
citizens
in
that
country
with
which
we
carry
on
important
commerce
several
vessels
of
our
new
navy
are
now
and
for
some
time
have
been
stationed
at
rio
de
janeiro
the
struggle
being
between
the
established
government
which
controls
the
machinery
of
administration
and
with
which
we
maintain
friendly
relations
and
certain
officers
of
the
navy
employing
the
vessels
of
their
command
in
an
attack
upon
the
national
capital
and
chief
seaport
and
lacking
as
it
does
the
elements
of
divided
administration
i
have
failed
to
see
that
the
insurgents
can
reasonably
claim
recognition
as
belligerents
thus
far
the
position
of
our
government
has
been
that
of
an
attentive
but
impartial
observer
of
the
unfortunate
conflict
emphasizing
our
fixed
policy
of
impartial
neutrality
in
such
a
condition
of
affairs
as
now
exists
i
deemed
it
necessary
to
disavow
in
a
manner
not
to
be
misunderstood
the
unauthorized
action
of
our
late
naval
commander
in
those
waters
in
saluting
the
revolted
brazilian
admiral
being
indisposed
to
countenance
an
act
calculated
to
give
gratuitous
sanction
to
the
local
insurrection
the
convention
between
our
government
and
chile
having
for
its
object
the
settlement
and
adjustment
of
the
demand
of
the
two
countries
against
each
other
has
been
made
effective
by

organization
of

commission
provided
for
the
two
governments
failing
to
agree
upon
the
third
member
of
the
commission
the
good
offices
of
the
president
of
the
swiss
republic
were
invoked
as
provided
in
the
treaty
and
the
selection
of
the
swiss
representative
in
this
country
to
complete
the
organization
was
gratifying
alike
to
the
united
states
and
chile
the
vexatious
question
of
socalled
legation
asylum
for
offenders
against
the
state
and
its
laws
was
presented
anew
in
chile
by
the
unauthorized
action
of
the
late
united
states
minister
in
receiving
into
his
official
residence
two
persons
who
had
just
failed
in
an
attempt
at
revolution
and
against
whom
criminal
charges
were
pending
growing
out
of
a
former
abortive
disturbance
the
doctrine
of
asylum
as
applied
to
this
case
is
not
sanctioned
by
the
best
precedents
and
when
allowed
tends
to
encourage
sedition
and
strife
under
no
circumstances
can
the
representatives
of
this
government
be
permitted
under
the
illdefined
fiction
of
extraterritoriality
to
interrupt
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
countries
to
which
they
are
accredited
a
temperate
demand
having
been
made
by
the
chilean
government
for
the
correction
of
this
conduct
in
the
instance
mentioned
the
minister
was
instructed
no
longer
to
harbor
the
offenders
the
legislation
of
last
year
known
as
the
geary
law
requiring
the
registration
of
all
chinese
laborers
entitled
to
residence
in
the
united
states
and
the
deportation
of
all
not
complying
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
within
the
time
prescribed
met
with
much
opposition
from
chinamen
in
this
country
acting
upon
the
advice
of
eminent
counsel
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
the
great
mass
of
chinese
laborers
pending
judicial
inquiry
as
to
its
validity
in
good
faith
declined
to
apply
for
the
certificates
required
by
its
provisions
a
test
case
upon
proceeding
by
habeas
corpus
was
brought
before
the
supreme
court
and
on
may
a
decision
was
made
by
that
tribunal
sustaining
the
law
it
is
believed
that
under
the
recent
amendment
of
the
act
extending
the
time
for
registration
the
chinese
laborers
thereto
entitled
who
desire
to
reside
in
this
country
will
now
avail
themselves
of
the
renewed
privilege
thus
afforded
of
establishing
by
lawful
procedure
their
right
to
remain
and
that
thereby
the
necessity
of
enforced
deportation
may
to
a
great
degree
be
avoided
it
has
devolved
upon
the
united

at

of

body

in
the

to

upon

reparation
for

means
for
the
punishment
of
persons
selling

ammunition
to

for
the
confiscation
of

inhibited
articles
it
being
the
plain
duty
of
this

to
aid
in
suppressing
the
nefarious
traffic
impairing
as
it
does
the
praiseworthy
and
civilizing
efforts
now
in
progress
in

recommend
that
an
act
be
passed
prohibiting
the
sale

costa
rica
has
lately
testified
its
friendliness
by
surrendering
to
the
united
states
in
the
absence
of
a
convention
of
extradition
but
upon
duly
submitted
evidence
of
criminality
a
noted
fugitive
from
justice
it
is
trusted
that
the
negotiation
of
a
treaty
with
that
country
to
meet
recurring
cases
of
this
kind
will
soon
be
accomplished
in
my
opinion
treaties
for
reciprocal
extradition
should
be
concluded
with
all
those
countries
with
which
the
united
states
has
not
already
conventional
arrangements
of
that
character
i
have
deemed
it
fitting
to
express
to
the
governments
of
costa
rica
and
colombia
the
kindly
desire
of
the
united
states
to
see
their
pending
boundary
dispute
finally
closed
by
arbitration
in
conformity
with
the
spirit
of
the
treaty
concluded
between
them
some
years
ago
our
relations
with
the
french
republic
continue
to
be
intimate
and
cordial
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
extradition
treaty
with
that
country
as
amended
by
the
senate
will
soon
be
operative
while
occasional
questions
affecting
our
naturalized
citizens
returning
to
the
land
of
their
birth
have
arisen
in
our
intercourse
with
germany
our
relations
with
that
country
continue
satisfactory
the
questions
affecting
our
relations
with
great
britain
have
been
treated
in
a
spirit
of
friendliness
negotiations
are
in
progress
between
the
two
governments
with
a
view
to
such
concurrent
action
as
will
make
the
award
and
regulations
agreed
upon
by
the
bering
sea
tribunal
of
arbitration
practically
effective
and
it
is
not
doubted
that
great
britain
will
cooperate
freely
with
this
country
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
purpose
the
dispute
growing
out
of
the
discriminating
tolls
imposed
in
the
welland
canal
upon
cargoes
of
cereals
bound
to
and
from
the
lake
ports
of
the
united
states
was
adjusted
by
the
substitution
of
a
more
equitable
schedule
of
charges
and
my
predecessor
thereupon
suspended
his
proclamation
imposing
discriminating
tolls
upon
british
transit
through
our
canals
a
request
for
additions
to
the
list
of
extraditable
offenses
covered
by
the
existing
treaty
between
the
two
countries
is
under
consideration
during
the
past
year
an
american
citizen
employed
in
a
subordinate
commercial
position
in
hayti
after
suffering
a
protracted
imprisonment
on
an
unfounded
charge
of
smuggling
was
finally
liberated
on
judicial
examination
upon
urgent
representation
to
the
haytian
government
a
suitable
indemnity
was
paid
to
the
sufferer
by
a
law
of
hayti
a
sailing
vessel
having
discharged
her
cargo
is
refused
clearance
until
the
duties
on
such
cargo
have
been
paid
the
hardship
of
this
measure
upon
american
shipowners
who
conduct
the
bulk
of
the
carrying
trade
of
that
country
has
been
insisted
on
with
a
view
of
securing
the
removal
of
this
cause
of
complaint
upon
receiving
authentic
information
of
the
firing
upon
an
american
mail
steamer
touching
at
the
port
of
amapala
because
her
captain
refused
to
deliver
up
a
passenger
in
transit
from
nicaragua
to
guatemala
upon
demand
of
the
military
authorities
of
honduras
our
minister
to
that
country
under
instructions
protested
against
the
wanton
act
and
demanded
satisfaction
the
government
of
honduras
actuated
by
a
sense
of
justice
and
in
a
spirit
of
the
utmost
friendship
promptly
disavowed
the
illegal
conduct
of
its
officers
and
expressed
sincere
regret
for
the
occurrence
it
is
confidently
anticipated
that
a
satisfactory
adjustment
will
soon
be
reached
of
the
questions
arising
out
of
the
seizure
and
use
of
american
vessels
by
insurgents
in
honduras
and
the
subsequent
denial
by
the
successful
government
of
commercial
privileges
to
those
vessels
on
that
account
a
notable
part
of
the
southeasterly

coast
of
liberia
between
the
cavally
and
san
pedro
rivers
which
for
nearly
half
a
century
has
been
generally
recognized
as
belonging
to
that
republic
by
cession
and
purchase
has
been
claimed
to
be
under
the
protectorate
of
france
in
virtue
of
agreements
entered
into
by
the
native
tribes
over
whom
liberias
control
has
not
been
well
maintained
more
recently
negotiations
between
the
liberian
representative
and
the
french
government
resulted
in
the
signature
at
paris
of
a
treaty
whereby
as
an
adjustment
certain
liberian
territory
is
ceded
to
france
this
convention
at
last
advices
had
not
been
ratified
by
the
liberian
legislature
and
executive
feeling
a
sympathetic
interest
in
the
fortunes
of
the
little
commonwealth
the
establishment
and
development
of
which
were
largely
aided
by
the
benevolence
of
our
countrymen
and
which
constitutes
the
only
independently
sovereign
state
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
this
government
has
suggested
to
the
french
government
its
earnest
concern
lest
territorial
impairment
in
liberia
should
take
place
without
her
unconstrained
consent
our
relations
with
mexico
continue
to
be
of
that
close
and
friendly
nature
which
should
always
characterize
the
intercourse
of
two
neighboring
republics
the
work
of
relocating
the
monuments
marking
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
from
paso
del
norte
to
the
pacific
is
now
nearly
completed
the
commission
recently
organized
under
the
conventions
of
and
it
is
expected
will
speedily
settle
disputes
growing
out
of
the
shifting
currents
of
the
rio
grande
river
east
of
e
paso
nicaragua
has
recently
passed
through
two
revolutions
the
party
at
first
successful
having
in
turn
been
displaced
by
another
our
newly
appointed
minister
by
his
timely
good
offices
aided
in
a
peaceful
adjustment
of
the
controversy
involved
in
the
first
conflict
the
large
american
interests
established
in
that
country
in
connection
with
the
nicaragua
canal
were
not
molested
the
canal
company
has
unfortunately
become
financially
seriously
embarrassed
but
a
generous
treatment
had
been
extended
to
it
by
the
government
of
nicaragua
the
united
states
are
especially
interested
in
the
successful
achievement
of
the
vast
undertaking
this
company
has
in
charge
that
it
should
be
accomplished
under
distinctively
american
auspices
and
its
enjoyment
assured
not
only
to
the
vessels
of
this
country
as
a
channel
of
communication
between
our
atlantic
and
pacific
seaboards
but
to
the
ships
of
the
world
in
the
interests
of
civilization
is
a
proposition
which
in
my
judgment
does
not
admit
of
question
guatemala
has
also
been
visited
by
the
political
vicissitudes
which
have
afflicted
her
central
american
neighbors
but
the
dissolution
of
its
legislature
and
the
proclamation
of
a
dictatorship
have
been
unattended
with
civil
war
an
extradition
treaty
with
norway
has
recently
been
exchanged
and
proclaimed
the
extradition
treaty
with
russia
signed
in
march
and
amended
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
in
february
last
was
duly
proclaimed
last
june
led
by
a
desire
to
compose
differences
and
contribute
to
the
restoration
of
order
in
samoa
which
for
some
years
previous
had
been
the
scene
of
conflicting
foreign
pretensions
and
native
strife
the
united
states
departing
from
its
policy
consecrated
by
a
century
of
observance
entered
four
years
ago
into
the
treaty
of
berlin
thereby
becoming
jointly
bound
with
england
and
germany
to
establish
and
maintain
malietoa
laupepa
as
king
of
samoa
the
treaty
provided
for
a
foreign
court
of
justice
a
municipal
council
for
the
district
of
apia
with
a
foreign
president
thereof
authorized
to
advise
the
king
a
tribunal
for
the
settlement
of
native
and
foreign
land
titles
and
a
revenue
system
for
the
kingdom
it
entailed
upon
the
three
powers
that
part
of
the
cost
of
the
new
government
not
met
by
the
revenue
of
the
islands
early
in
the
life
of
this
triple
protectorate
the
native
dissensions
it
was
designed
to
quell
revived
rivals
defied
the
authority
of
the
new
king
refusing
to
pay
taxes
and
demanding
the
election
of
a
ruler
by
native
suffrage
mataafa
an
aspirant
to
the
throne
and
a
large
number
of
his
native
adherents
were
in
open
rebellion
on
one
of
the
islands
quite
lately
at
the
request
of
the
other
powers
and
in
fulfillment
of
its
treaty
obligation
this
government
agreed
to
unite
in
a
joint
military
movement
of
such
dimensions
as
would
probably
secure
the
surrender
of
the
insurgents
without
bloodshed
the
war
ship
philadelphia
was
accordingly
put
under
orders
for
samoa
but
before
she
arrived
the
threatened
conflict
was
precipitated
by
king
malietoas
attack
upon
the
insurgent
camp
mataafa
was
defeated
and
a
number
of
his
men
killed
the
british
and
german
naval
vessels
present
subsequently
secured
the
surrender
of
mataafa
and
his
adherents
the
defeated
chief
and
ten
of
his
principal
supporters
were
deported
to
a
german
island
of
the
marshall
group
where
they
are
held
as
prisoners
under
the
joint
responsibility
and
cost
of
the
three
powers
this
incident
and
the
events
leading
up
to
it
signally
illustrate
the
impolicy
of
entangling
alliances
with
foreign
powers
more
than
fifteen
years
ago
this
government
preferred
a
claim
against
spain
in
behalf
of
one
of
our
citizens
for
property
seized
and
confiscated
in
cuba
in
the
claim
was
adjusted
spain
agreeing
to
pay
unconditionally
as
a
fair
indemnity
a
respectful
but
earnest
note
was
recently
addressed
to
the
spanish
government
insisting
upon
prompt
fulfillment
of
its
longneglected
obligation
other
claims
preferred
by
the
united
states
against
spain
in
behalf
of
american
citizens
for
property
confiscated
in
cuba
have
been
pending
for
many
years
at
the
time
spains
title
to
the
caroline
islands
was
confirmed
by
arbitration
that
government
agreed
that
the
rights
which
had
been
acquired
there
by
american
missionaries
should
be
recognized
and
respected
it
is
sincerely
hoped
that
this
pledge
will
be
observed
by
allowing
our
missionaries
who
were
removed
from
ponape
to
a
place
of
safety
by
a
united
states
war
ship
during
the
late
troubles
between
the
spanish
garrison
and
the
natives
to
return
to
their
field
of
usefulness
the
reproduced
caravel
santa
maria
built
by
spain
and
sent
to
the
columbian
exposition
has
been
presented
to
the
united
states
in
token
of
amity
and
in
commemoration
of
the
event
it
was
designed
to
celebrate
i
recommend
that
in
accepting
this
gift
congress
make
grateful
recognition
of
the
sincere
friendship
which
prompted
it
important
matters
have
demanded
attention
in
our
relations
with
the
ottoman
porte
the
firing
and
partial
destruction
by
an
unrestrained
mob

with
the
intention

this
complaint
is
not
wholly
without
foundation
a

published
in

in
the
armenian
language
openly
counsels
its
readers
to
arm
organize
and
participate
in
movements
for
the
subversion
of
turkish
authority
in
the
asiatic
provinces
the
ottoman
government
has
announced
its
intention
to
expel
from
its
dominions
armenians
who
have
obtained
naturalization
in
the
united
states
since
the
right
to
exclude
any
or
all
classes
of
aliens
is
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
it
is
a
right
asserted
and
to
a
limited
extent
enforced
by
the
united
states
with
the
sanction
of
our
highest
court
there
being
no
naturalization
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
turkey
our
minister
at
constantinople
has
been
instructed
that
while
recognizing
the
right
of
that
government
to
enforce
its
declared
policy
against
naturalized
armenians
he
is
expected
to
protect
them
from
unnecessary
harshness
of
treatment
in
view
of
the
impaired
financial
resources
of
venezuela
consequent
upon
the
recent
revolution
there
a
modified
arrangement
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
awards
of
the
late
revisory
claims
commission
in
progressive
installments
has
been
assented
to
and
payments
are
being
regularly
made
thereunder
the
boundary
dispute
between
venezuela
and
british
guiana
is
yet
unadjusted
a
restoration
of
diplomatic
intercourse
between
that
republic
and
great
britain
and
reference
of
the
question
to
impartial
arbitration
would
be
a
most
gratifying
consummation
the
ratification
by
venezuela
of
the
convention
for
the
arbitration
of
the
longdeferred
claim
of
the
venezuelan
transportation
company
is
awaited
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
state
that
the
questions
arising
from
our
relations
with
hawaii
have
caused
serious
embarrassment
just
prior
to
the
installation
of
the
present
administration
the
existing
government
of
hawaii
had
been
suddenly
overthrown
and
a
treaty
of
annexation
had
been
negotiated
between
the
provisional
government
of
the
islands
and
the
united
states
and
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
this
treaty
i
withdrew
for
examination
and
dispatched
hon
james
h
blount
of
georgia
to
honolulu
as
a
special
commissioner
to
make
an
impartial
investigation
of
the
circumstances
attending
the
change
of
government
and
of
all
the
conditions

bearing
upon
the
subject
of
the
treaty
after
a
thorough
and
exhaustive
examination
mr
blount
submitted
to
me
his
report
showing
beyond
all
question
that
the
constitutional
government
of
hawaii
had
been
subverted
with
the
active
aid
of
our
representative
to
that
government
and
through
the
intimidation
caused
by
the
presence
of
an
armed
naval
force
of
the
united
states
which
was
landed
for
that
purpose
at
the
instance
of
our
minister
upon
the
facts
developed
it
seemed
to
me
the
only
honorable
course
for
our
government
to
pursue
was
to
undo
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
by
those
representing
us
and
to
restore
as
far
as
practicable
the
status
existing
at
the
time
of
our
forcible
intervention
with
a
view
of
accomplishing
this
result
within
the
constitutional
limits
of
executive
power
and
recognizing
all
our
obligations
and
responsibilities
growing
out
of
any
changed
conditions
brought
about
by
our
unjustifiable
interference
our
present
minister
at
honolulu
has
received
appropriate
instructions
to
that
end
thus
far
no
information
of
the
accomplishment
of
any
definite
results
has
been
received
from
him
additional
advices
are
soon
expected
when
received
they
will
be
promptly
sent
to
the
congress
together
with
all
other
information
at
hand
accompanied
by
a
special
executive
message
fully
detailing
all
the
facts
necessary
to
a
complete
understanding
of
the
case
and
presenting
a
history
of
all
the
material
events
leading
up
to
the
present
situation
by
a
concurrent
resolution
passed
by
the
senate
february
and
by
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
d
of
april
following
the
president
was
requested
to
invite
from
time
to
time
as
fit
occasions
may
arise
negotiations
with
any
government
with
which
the
united
states
has
or
may
have
diplomatic
relations
to
the
end
that
any
differences
or
disputes
arising
between
the
two
governments
which
can
not
be
adjusted
by
diplomatic
agency
may
be
referred
to
arbitration
and
be
peaceably
adjusted
by
such
means
april
the
international
american
conference
of
washington
by
resolution
expressed
the
wish
that
all
controversies
between
the
republics
of
america
and
the
nations
of
europe
might
be
settled
by
arbitration
and
recommended
that
the
government
of
each
nation
represented
in
that
conference
should
communicate
this
wish
to
all
friendly
powers
a
favorable
response
has
been
received
from
great
britain
in
the
shape
of
a
resolution
adopted
by
parliament
july
last
cordially
sympathizing
with
the
purpose
in
view
and
expressing
the
hope
that
her
majestys
government
will
lend
ready
cooperation
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
upon
the
basis
of
the
concurrent
resolution
above
quoted
it
affords
me
signal
pleasure
to
lay
this
parliamentary
resolution
before
the
congress
and
to
express
my
sincere
gratification
that
the
sentiment
of
two
great
and
kindred
nations
is
thus
authoritatively
manifested
in
favor
of
the
rational
and
peaceable
settlement
of
international
quarrels
by
honorable
resort
to
arbitration
since
thepassage
of
the
act
of
march
authorizing
the
president
to
raise
the
grade
of
our
envoys
to
correspond
with
the
rank
in
which
foreign
countries
accredit
their
agents
here
great
britain
france
italy
and
germany
have
conferred
upon
their
representatives
at
this
capital
the
title
of
ambassador
and
i
have
responded
by
accrediting
the
agents
of
the
united
states
in
those
countries
with
the
same
title
a
like
elevation
of
mission
is
announced
by
russia
and
when
made
will
be
similarly
met
this
step
fittingly
comports
with
the
position
the
united
states
hold
in
the
family
of
nations
during
my
former
administration
i
took
occasion
to
recommend
a
recast
of
the
laws
relating
to
the
consular
service
in
order
that
it
might
become
a
more
efficient
agency
in
the
promotion
of
the
interests
it
was
intended
to
subserve
the
duties
and
powers
of
consuls
have
been
expanded
with
the
growing
requirements
of
our
foreign
trade
discharging
important
duties
affecting
our
commerce
and
american
citizens
abroad
and
in
certain
countries
exercising
judicial
functions
these
officers
should
be
men
of
character
intelligence
and
ability
upon
proof
that
the
legislation
of
denmark
secures
copyright
to
american
citizens
on
equal
footing
with
its
own
the
privileges
of
our
copyright

been
extended

was
having
an
aggregate
capital
of

net
increase
in

of

during

was
the
recent
repeal
of
the
provision
of
law
requiring
the
purchase
of
silver
bullion
by
the
government
as
a
feature
of
our
monetary
scheme
has
made
an
entire
change
in
the
complexion
of
our
currency
affairs
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
ultimate
result
of
this
action
will
be
most
salutary
and
farreaching
in
the
nature
of
things
however
it
is
impossible
to
know
at
this
time
precisely
what
conditions
will
be
brought
about
by
the
change
or
what
if
any
supplementary
legislation
may
in
the
light
of
such
conditions
appear
to
be
essential
or
expedient
of
course
after
the
recent
financial
perturbation
time
is
necessary
for
the
reestablishment
of
business
confidence
when
however
through
this
restored
confidence
the
money
which
has
been
frightened
into
hoarding
places
is
returned
to
trade
and
enterprise
a
survey
of
the
situation
will
probably
disclose
a
safe
path
leading
to
a
permanently
sound
currency
abundantly
sufficient
to
meet
every
requirement
of
our
increasing
population
and
business
in
the
pursuit
of
this
object
we
should
resolutely
turn
away
from
alluring
and
temporary
expedients
determined
to
be
content
with
nothing
less
than
a
lasting
and
comprehensive
financial
plan
in
these
circumstances
i
am
convinced
that
a
reasonable
delay
in
dealing
with
this
subject
instead
of
being
injurious
will
increase
the
probability
of
wise
action
the
monetary
conference
which
assembled
at
brussels
upon
our
invitation
was
adjourned
to
the
th
day
of
november
of
the
present
year
the
considerations
just
stated
and
the
fact
that
a
definite
proposition
from
us
seemed
to
be
expected
upon
the
reassembling
of
the
conference
led
me
to
express
a
willingness
to
have
the
meeting
still
further
postponed
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
wise
to
give
general
authority
to
the
president
to
invite
other
nations
to
such
a
conference
at
any
time
when
there
should
be
a
fair
prospect
of
accomplishing
an
international
agreement
on
the
subject
of
coinage
i
desire
also
to
earnestly
suggest
the
wisdom
of
amending
the
existing
statutes
in
regard
to
the
issuance
of
government
bonds
the
authority
now
vested
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
issue
bonds
is
not
as
clear
as
it
should
be
and
the
bonds
authorized
are
disadvantageous
to
the
government
both
as
to
the
time
of
their
maturity
and
rate
of
interest
the
superintendent
of
immigration
through
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
reports
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
there
arrived
at
our
ports
immigrants
of
these
were
not
permitted
to
land
under
the
limitat
ions
of
the
law
and
were
returned
to
the
countries
from
whence
they
came
by
reason
of
their
having
become
public
charges
the
total
arrivals
were
less
than
for
the
previous
year
the
secretary
in
his
report
gives
an
account
of
the
operation
of
the
marinehospital
service
and
of
the
good
work
done
under
its
supervision
in
preventing
the
entrance
and
spread
of
contagious
diseases
the
admonitions
of
the
last
two
years
touching
our
public
health
and
the
demonstrated
danger
of
the
introduction
of
contagious
diseases
from
foreign
ports
have
invested
the
subject
of
national
quarantine
with
increased
interest
a
more
general
and
harmonious
system
than
now
exists
acting
promptly
and
directly
everywhere
and
constantly
operating
by
preventive
means
to
shield
our
country
from
the
invasion
of
disease
and
at
the
same
time
having
due
regard
to
the
rights
and
duties
of
local
agencies
would
i
believe
add
greatly
to
the
safety
of
our
people
the
secretary
of
war
reports
that
the
strength
of
the
army
on
the
th
day
of
september
last
was
enlisted
men
and
officers
the
total
expenditures
of
the
department
for
the
year
ending
june
amounted
to
of
this
sum
was
for
salaries
and
contingent
expenses
for
the
support
of
the
military
establishment
for
miscellaneous
objects
and
for
public
works
this
latter
sum
includes
for
river
and
harbor
improvements
and
for
fortifications
and
other
works
of
defense
the
total
enrollment
of
the
militia
of
the
several
states
was
on
the
st
of
october
of
the
current
year
officers
and
enlisted
men
the
officers
of
the
army
detailed
for
the
inspection
and
instruction
of
this
reserve
of
our
military
force
report
that
increased
interest
and
marked
progress
are
apparent
in
the
discipline
and
efficiency
of
the
organization
neither
indian
outbreaks
nor
domestic
violence
have
called
the
army
into
service
during
the
year
and
the
only
active
military
duty
required
of
it
has
been
in
the
department
of
texas
where
violations
of
the
neutrality
laws
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
were
promptly
and
efficiently
dealt
with
by
the
troops
eliciting
the
warm
approval
of
the
civil
and
military
authorities
of
both
countries
the
operation
of
wise
laws
and
the
influences
of
civilization
constantly
tending
to
relieve
the
country
from
the
dangers
of
indian
hostilities
together
with
the
increasing
ability
of
the
states
through
the
efficiency
of
the
national
guard
organizations
to
protect
their
citizens
from
domestic
violence
lead
to
the
suggestion
that
the
time
is
fast
approaching
when
there
should
be
a
reorganization
of
our
army
on
the
lines
of
the
present
necessities
of
the
country
this
change
contemplates
neither
increase
in
number
nor
added
expense
but
a
redistribution
of
the
force
and
an
encouragement
of
measures
tending
to
greater
efficiency
among
the
men
and
improvement
of
the
service
the
adoption
of
battalion
formations
for
infantry
regiments
the
strengthening
of
the
artillery
force
the
abandonment
of
smaller
and
unnecessary
posts
and
the
massing
of
the
troops
at
important
and
accessible
stations
all
promise
to
promote
the
usefulness
of
the
army
in
the
judgment
of
army
officers
with
but
few
exceptions
the
operation
of
the
law
forbidding
the
reenlistment
of
men
after
ten
years
service
has
not
proved
its
wisdom
and
while
the
arguments
that
led
to
its
adoption
were
not
without
merit
the
experience
of
the
year
constrains
me
to
join
in
the
recommendation
for
its
repeal
it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
we
have
begun
to
attain
completed
results
in
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
seacoast
defense
and
fortification
entered
upon
eight
years
ago
a
large
sum
has
been
already
expended
but
the
cost
of
maintenance
will
be
inconsiderable
as
compared
with
the
expense
of
construction
and
ordnance
at
the
end
of
the
current
calendar
year
the
war
department
will
have
nine
inch
guns
twenty
inch
and
thirtyfour
inch
guns
ready
to
be
mounted
on
gun
lifts
and
carriages
and
seventyfive
inch
mortars
in
addition
to
the
product
of
the
army
gun
factory
now
completed
at
watervliet
the
government
has
contracted
with
private
parties
for
the
purchase
of
one
hundred
guns
of
these
calibers
the
first
of
which
should
be
delivered
to
the
department
for
test
before
july
the
manufacture
of
heavy
ordnance
keeps
pace
with
current
needs
but
to
render
these
guns
available
for
the
purposes
they
are
designed
to
meet
emplacements
must
be
prepared
for
them
progress
has
been
made
in
this
direction
and
it
is
desirable
that
congress
by
adequate
appropriations
should
provide
for
the
uninterrupted
prosecution
of
this
necessary
work
after
much
preliminary
work
and
exhaustive
examination
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
law
the
board
appointed
to
select
a
magazine
rifle
of
modern
type
with
which
to
replace
the
obsolete
springfield
rifle
of
the
infantry
service
completed
its
labors
during
the
last
year
and
the
work
of
manufacture
is
now
in
progress
at
the
national
armory
at
springfield
it
is
confidently
expected
that
by
the
end
of
the
current
year
our
infantry
will
be
supplied
with
a
weapon
equal
to
that
of
the
most
progressive
armies
of
the
world
the
work
on
the
projected
chickamauga
and
chattanooga
national
military
park
has
been
prosecuted
with
zeal
and
judgment
and
its
opening
will
be
celebrated
during
the
coming
year
over
square
miles
of
the
chickamauga
battlefield
have
been
acquired
miles
of
roadway
have
been
constructed
and
permanent
tablets
have
been
placed
at
many
historical
points
while
the
invitation
to
the
states
to
mark
the
positions
of
their
troops
participating
in
the
battle
has
been
very
generally
accepted
the
work
of
locating
and
preserving
the
lines
of
battle
at
the
gettysburg
battlefield
is
making
satisfactory
progress
on
the
plans
directed
by
the
last
congress
the
reports
of
the
military
academy
at
west
point
and
the
several
schools
for
special
instruction
of
officers
show
marked
advance
in
the
education
of
the
army
and
a
commendable
ambition
among
its
officers
to
excel
in
the
military
profession
and
to
fit
themselves
for
the
highest
service
to
the
country
under
the
supervision
of
adjutantgeneral
robert
williams
lately
retired
the
bureau
of
military
information
has
become
well
established
and
is
performing
a
service
that
will
put
in
possession
of
the
government
in
time
of
war
most
valuable
information
and
at
all
times
serve
a
purpose
of
great
utility
in
keeping
the
army
advised
of
the
worlds
progress
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
art
of
war
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
contains
the
usual
summary
of
the
affairs
and
proceedings
of
the
department
of
justice
for
the
past
year
together
with
certain
recommendations
as
to
needed
legislation
on
various
subjects
i
can
not
too
heartily
indorse
the
proposition
that
the
fee
system
as
applicable
to
the
compensation
of
united
states
attorneys
marshals
clerks
of
federal
courts
and
united
states
commissioners
should
be
abolished
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
it
is
clearly
in
the
interest
of
the
community
that
the
business
of
the
courts
both
civil
and
criminal
shall
be
as
small
and
as
inexpensively
transacted
as
the
ends
of
justice
will
allow
the
system
is
therefore
thoroughly
vicious
which
makes
the
compensation
of
court
officials
depend
upon
the
volume
of
such
business
and
thus
creates
a
conflict
between
a
proper
execution
of
the
law
and
private
gain
which
can
not
fail
to
be
dangerous
to
the
rights
and
freedom
of
the
citizen
and
an
irresistible
temptation
to
the
unjustifiable
expenditure
of
public
funds
if
in
addition
to
this
reform
another
was
inaugurated
which
would
give
to
united
states
commissioners
the
final
disposition
of
petty
offenses
within
the
grade
of
misdemeanors
especially
those
coming
under
the
internalrevenue
laws
a
great
advance
would
be
made
toward
a
more
decent
administration
of
the
criminal
law
in
my
first
message
to
congress
dated
december
i
strongly
recommended
these
changes
and
referred
somewhat
at
length
to
the
evils
of
the
present
system
since
that
time
the
criminal
business
of
the
federal
courts
and
the
expense
attending
it
have
enormously
increased
the
number
of
criminal
prosecutions
pending
in
the
circuit
and
district
courts
of
the
united
states
on
the
st
day
of
july
was
of
which
were
for
violations
of
the
internalrevenue
laws
while
the
number
of
such
prosecutions
pending
on
the
st
day
of
july
was
of
which
were
for
violations
of
the
internalrevenue
laws
the
expense
of
the
united
states
courts
exclusive
of
judges
salaries
for
the
year
ending
july
was
and
for
the
year
ending
july
it
is
therefore
apparent
that
the
reasons
given
in
for
a
change
in
the
manner
of
enforcing
the
federal
criminal
law
have
gained
cogency
and
strength
by
lapse
of
time
i
also
heartily
join
the
attorneygeneral
in
recommending
legislation
fixing
degrees
of
the
crime
of
murder
within
federal
jurisdiction
as
has
been
done
in
many
of
the
states
authorizing
writs
of
error
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
cases
where
final
judgment
is
rendered
against
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment
or
against
the
government
upon
any
other
question
arising
before
actual
trial
limiting
the
right
of
review
in
cases
of
felony
punishable
only
by
fine
and
imprisonment
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
making
speedy
provision
for
the
construction
of
such
prisons
and
reformatories
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
confinement
of
united
states
convicts
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
contains
a
detailed
statement
of
the
operations
of
the
postoffice
department
during
the
last
fiscal
year
and
much
interesting
information
touching
this
important
branch
of
the
public
service
the
business
of
the
mails
indicates
with
absolute
certainty
the
condition
of
the
business
of
the
country
and
depression
in
financial
affairs
inevitably
and
quickly
reduces
the
postal
revenues
therefore
a
larger
discrepancy
than
usual
between
the
postoffice
receipts
and
expenditures
is
the
expected
and
unavoidable
result
of
the
distressing
stringency
which
has
prevailed
throughout
the
country
during
much
of
the
time
covered
by
the
postmastergenerals
report
at
a
date
when
better
times
were
a
nticipated
it
was
estimated
by
his
predecessor
that
the
deficiency
on
the
th
day
of
june
would
be
but
a
little
over
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
it
amounted
however
to
more
than
five
millions
at
the
same
time
and
under
the
influence
of
like
anticipations
estimates
were
made
for
the
current
fiscal
year
ending
june
which
exhibited
a
surplus
of
revenue
over
expenditures
of
but
now
in
view
of
the
actual
receipts
and
expenditures
during
that
part
of
the
current
fiscal
year
already
expired
the
present
postmastergeneral
estimates
that
at
its
close
instead
of
a
surplus
there
will
be
a
deficiency
of
nearly
the
postoffice
receipts
for
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
and
its
expenditures
to
this
postoffice
deficiency
would
disappear
or
be
immensely
decreased
if
less
matter
were
carried
free
through
the
mails
an
item
of
which
is
upward
of
tons
of
seeds
and
grain
from
the
agricultural
department
the
total
number
of
postoffices
in
the
united
states
on
the
th
day
of
june
was
an
increase
of
over
the
preceding
year
of
these
were
presidential
an
increase
in
that
class
of
over
the
preceding
year
fortytwo
freedelivery
offices
were
added
during
the
year
to
those
already
existing
making
a
total
of
cities
and
towns
provided
with
free
delivery
on
june
ninetythree
other
cities
and
towns
are
now
entitled
to
this
service
under
the
law
but
it
has
not
been
accorded
them
on
account
of
insufficient
funds
to
meet
the
expenses
of
its
establishment
i
am
decidedly
of
the
opinion
that
the
provisions
of
the
present
law
permit
as
general
an
introduction
of
this
feature
of
mail
service
as
is
necessary
or
justifiable
and
that
it
ought
not
to
be
extended
to
smaller
communities
than
are
now
designated
the
expenses
of
free
delivery
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
will
be
more
than
and
under
legislation
now
existing
there
must
be
a
constant
increase
in
this
item
of
expenditure
there
were
additions
to
the
domestic
moneyorder
offices
during
the
last
fiscal
year
being
the
largest
increase
in
any
year
since
the
inauguration
of
the
system
the
total
number
of
these
offices
at
the
close
of
the
year
was
there
were
money
orders
issued
from
these
offices
being
an
increase
over
the
preceding
year
of
and
the
value
of
these
orders
amounted
to
an
increase
of
there
were
also
issued
during
the
year
postal
notes
amounting
to
during
the
year
international
moneyorder
offices
were
added
to
those
already
provided
making
a
total
of
in
operation
on
june
the
number
of
international
money
orders
issued
during
the
year
was
an
increase
over
the
preceding
year
of
and
their
value
was
an
increase
of
the
number
of
orders
paid
was
an
increase
over
the
preceding
year
of
and
their
value
was
an
increase
of
from
the
foregoing
statements
it
appears
that
the
total
issue
of
money
orders
and
postal
notes
for
the
year
amounted
to
the
number
of
letters
and
packages
mailed
during
the
year
for
special
delivery
was
an
increase
over
the
preceding
year
of
nearly
per
cent
the
specialdelivery
stamps
used
upon
these
letters
and
packages
amounted
to
and
the
messengers
fees
paid
for
their
delivery
amounted
to
leaving
a
profit
to
the
government
of
the
railway
mail
service
not
only
adds
to
the
promptness
of
mail
delivery
at
all
offices
but
it
is
the
especial
instrumentality
which
puts
the
smaller
and
way
places
in
the
service
on
an
equality
in
that
regard
with
the
larger
and
terminal
offices
this
branch
of
the
postal
service
has
therefore
received
much
attention
from
the
postmastergeneral
and
though
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
it
is
in
a
condition
of
high
efficiency
and
great
usefulness
i
am
led
to
agree
with
the
postmastergeneral
that
there
is
room
for
its
further
improvement
there
are
now
connected
to
the
postoffice
establishment
employees
who
are
in
the
classified
service
the
head
of
this
great
department
gives
conclusive
evidence
of
the
value
of
civilservice
reform
when
after
an
experience
that
renders
his
judgment
on
the
subject
absolutely
reliable
he
expresses
the
opinion
that
without
the
benefit
of
this
system
it
would
be
impossible
to
conduct
the
vast
business
intrusted
to
him
i
desire
to
commend
as
especially
worthy
of
prompt
attention
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
relating
to
a
more
sensible
and
business
like
organization
and
a
better
distribution
of
responsibility
in
his
department
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
contains
a
history
of
the
operations
of
his
department
during
the
past
year
and
exhibits
a
most
gratifying
condition
of
the
personnel
of
our
navy
he
presents
a
satisfactory
account
of
the
progress
which
has
been
made
in
the
construction
of
vessels
and
makes
a
number
of
recommendations
to
which
attention
is
especially
invited
during
the
past
six
months
the
demands
for
cruising
vessels
have
been
many
and
urgent
there
have
been
revolutions
calling
for
vessels
to
protect
american
interests
in
nicaragua
guatemala
costa
rica
honduras
argentina
and
brazil
while
the
condition
of
affairs
in
honolulu
has
required
the
constant
presence
of
one
or
more
ships
with
all
these
calls
upon
our
navy
it
became
necessary
in
order
to
make
up
a
sufficient
fleet
to
patrol
the
bering
sea
under
the
modus
vivendi
agreed
upon
with
great
britain
to
detail
to
that
service
one
vessel
from
the
fish
commission
and
three
from
the
revenue
marine
progress
in
the
construction
of
new
vessels
has
not
been
as
rapid
as
was
anticipated
there
have
been
delays
in
the
completion
of
unarmored
vessels
but
for
the
most
part
they
have
been
such
as
are
constantly
occurring
even
in
countries
having
the
largest
experience
in
naval
shipbuilding
the
most
serious
delays
however
have
been
in
the
work
upon
armored
ships
the
trouble
has
been
the
failure
of
contractors
to
deliver
armor
as
agreed
the
difficulties
seem
now
however
to
have
been
all
overcome
and
armor
is
being
delivered
with
satisfactory
promptness
as
a
result
of
the
experience
acquired
by
shipbuilders
and
designers
and
material
men
it
is
believed
that
the
dates
when
vessels
will
be
completed
can
now
be
estimated
with
reasonable
accuracy
great
guns
rapidfire
guns
torpedoes
and
powder

being
promptly

expected
that

last

will
be
completed
in
less
than
two
years
since
congress
has
at
each
session
authorized
the
building
of
one
or
more
vessels
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
presents
an
earnest
plea
for
the
continuance
of
this
plan
he
recommends
the
authorization
of
at
least
one
battle
ship
and
six
torpedo
boats
while
i
am
distinctly
in
favor
of
consistently
pursuing
the
policy
we
have
inaugurated
of
building
up
a
thorough
and
efficient
navy
i
can
not
refrain
from
the
suggestion
that
the
congress
should
carefully
take
into
account
the
number
of
unfinished
vessels
on
our
hands
and
the
depleted
condition
of
our
treasury
in
considering
the
propriety
of
an
appropriation
at
this
time
to
begin
new
work
the
method
of
employing
mechanical
labor
at
navyyards
through
boards
of
labor
and
making
efficiency
the
sole
test
by
which
laborers
are
employed
and
continued
is
producing
the
best
results
and
the
secretary
is
earnestly
devoting
himself
to
its
development
attention
is
invited
to
the
statements
of
his
report
in
regard
to
the
workings
of
the
system
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
the
supervision
of
so
many
important
subjects
that
his
report
is
of
especial
value
and
interest
on
the
th
day
of
june
there
were
on
the
pension
rolls
names
an
increase
of
over
the
number
on
the

of
these
there
were
widows

the

represents
those

added
to
the
rolls
during
the
year
was
and
the
number
dropped
was
the
first
payments
on
pensions
allowed
during
the
year
amounted
to
this
includes
arrears
or
the
accumulation
between
the
time
from
which
the
allowance
of
pension
dates
and
the
time
of
actually
granting
the
certificate
although
the
law
of
permits
pensions
for
disabilities
not
related
to
military
service
yet
as
a
requisite
to
its
benefits
a
disability
must
exist
incapacitating
applicants
from
the
performance
of
manual
labor
to
such
a
degree
as
to
render
them
unable
to
earn
a
support
the
execution
of
this
law
in
its
early
stages
does
not
seem
to
have
been
in
accord
with
its
true
intention
but
toward
the
close
of
the
last
administration
an
authoritative
construction
was
given
to

the
statute
and
since
that
time
this
construction
has
been
followed
this
has
had
the
effect
of
limiting
the
operation
of
the
law
to
its
intended
purpose
the
discovery
having
been
made
that
many
names
had
been
put
upon
the
pension
roll
by
means
of
wholesale
and
gigantic
frauds
the
commissioner
suspended
payments
upon
a
number
of
pensions
which
seemed
to
be
fraudulent
or
unauthorized
pending
a
complete
examination
giving
notice
to
the
pensioners
in
order
that
they
might
have
an
opportunity
to
establish
if
possible
the
justice
of
their
claims
notwithstanding
apparent
invalidity
this
i
understand
is
the
practice
which
has
for
a
long
time
prevailed
in
the
pension
bureau
but
after
entering
upon
these
recent
investigations
the
commissioner
modified
this
rule
so
as
not
to
allow
until
after
a
complete
examination
interference
with
the
payment
of
a
pension
apparently
not
altogether
void
but
which
merely
had
been
fixed
at
a
rate
higher
than
that
authorized
by
law
i
am
unable
to
understand
why
frauds
in
the
pension
rolls
should
not
be
exposed
and
corrected
with
thoroughness
and
vigor
every
name
fraudulently
put
upon
these
rolls
is
a
wicked
imposition
upon
the
kindly
sentiment
in
which
pensions
have
their
origin
every
fraudulent
pensioner
has
become
a
bad
citizen
every
false
oath
in
support
of
a
pension
has
made
perjury
more
common
and
false
and
undeserving
pensioners
rob
the
people
not
only
of
their
money
but
of
the
patriotic
sentiment
which
the
survivors
of
a
war
fought
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
ought
to
inspire
thousands
of
neighborhoods
have
their
wellknown
fraudulent
pensioners
and
recent
developments
by
the
bureau
establish
appalling
conspiracies
to
accomplish
pension
frauds
by
no
means
the
least
wrong
done
is
to
brave
and
deserving
pensioners
who
certainly
ought
not
to
be
condemned
to
such
association
those
who
attempt
in
the
line
of
duty
to
rectify
these
wrongs
should
not
be
accused
of
enmity
or
indifference
to
the
claims
of
honest
veterans
the
sum
expended
on
account
of
pensions
for
the
year
ending
june
was
the
commissioner
estimates
that
will
be
required
to
pay
pensions
during
the
year
ending
june
the
condition
of
the
indians
and
their
ultimate
fate
are
subjects
which
are
related
to
a
sacred
duty
of
the
government
and
which
strongly
appeal
to
the
sense
of
justice
and
the
sympathy
of
our
people
our
indians
number
about
most
of
them
are
located
on
reservations
containing
acres
of
land
about
of
these
indians
have
to
a
large
degree
adopted
civilized
customs
lands
in
severalty
have
been
allotted
to
many
of
them
such
allotments
have
been
made
to
individuals
during
the
last
fiscal
year
embracing
about
acres
the
number
of
indian
government
schools
opened
during
the
year
was
an
increase
of
over
the
preceding
year
of
this
total
were
on
reservations
of
which
were
boarding
schools
and
were
day
schools
twenty
boarding
schools
and
day
schools
supported
by
the
government
were
not
located
on
reservations
the
total
number
of
indian
children
enrolled
during
the
year
as
attendants
of
all
schools
was
an
increase
of
over
the
enrollment
for
the
previous
year
i
am
sure
that
secular
education
and
moral
and
religious
teaching
must
be
important
factors
in
any
effort
to
save
the
indian
and
lead
him
to
civilization
i
believe
too
that
the
relinquishment
of
tribal
relations
and
the
holding
of
land
in
severalty
may
in
favorable
conditions
aid
this
consummation
it
seems
to
me
however
that
allotments
of
land
in
severalty
ought
to
be
made
with
great
care
and
circumspection
if
hastily
done
before
the
indian
knows
its
meaning
while
yet
he
has
little
or
no
idea
of
tilling
a
farm
and
no
conception
of
thrift
there
is
great
danger
that
a
reservation
life
in
tribal
relations
may
be
exchanged
for
the
pauperism
of
civilization
instead
of
its
independence
and
elevation
the
solution
of
the
indian
problem
depends
very
largely
upon
good
administration
the
personal
fitness
of
agents
and
their
adaptability
to
the
peculiar
duty
of
caring
for
their
wards
are
of
the
utmost
importance
the
law
providing
that
except
in
special
cases
army
officers
shall
be
detailed
as
indian
agents
it
is
hoped
will
prove
a
successful
experiment
there
is
danger
of
great
abuses
creeping
into
the
prosecution
of
claims
for
indian
depredations
and
i
recommend
that
every
possible
safeguard
be
provided
against
the
enforcement
of
unjust
and
fictitious
claims
of
this
description
the
appropriations
on
account
of
the
indian
bureau
for
the
year
ending
june
amount
to
a
decrease
as
compared
with
the
year
preceding
it
of
the
vast
area
of
land
which
but
a
short
time
ago
constituted
the
public
domain
is
rapidly
falling
into
private
hands
it
is
certain
that
in
the
transfer
the
beneficent
intention
of
the
government
to
supply
from
its
domain
homes
to
the
industrious
and
worthy
home
seekers
is
often
frustrated
though
the
speculator
who
stands
with
extortionate
purpose
between
the
land
office
and
those
who
with
their
families
are
invited
by
the
government
to
settle
on
the
public
lands
is
a
despicable
character
who
ought
not
to
be
tolerated
yet
it
is
difficult
to
thwart
his
schemes
the
recent
opening
to
settlement
of
the
lands
in
the
cherokee
outlet
embracing
an
area
of
acres
notwithstanding
the
utmost
care
in
framing
the
regulations
governing
the
selection
of
locations
and
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
united
states
troops
furnished
an
exhibition
though
perhaps
in
a
modified
degree
of
the
mad
scramble
the
violence
and
the
fraudulent
occupation
which
have
accompanied
previous
openings
of
public
land
i
concur
with
the
secretary
in
the
belief
that
these
outrageous
incidents
can
not
be
entirely
prevented
without
a
change
in
the
laws
on
the
subject
and
i
hope
his
recommendations
in
that
direction
will
be
favorably
considered
i
especially
commend
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
the
statements
contained
in
the
secretarys
report
concerning
forestry
the
time
has
come
when
efficient
measures
should
be
taken
for
the
preservation
of
our
forests
from
indiscriminate
and
remediless
destruction
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
will
be
found
exceedingly
interesting
especially
to
that
large
part
of
our
citizens
intimately
concerned
in
agricultural
occupations
on
the
th
day
of
march
there
were
upon
its
pay
rolls
employees
this
number
has
been
reduced
to
persons
in
view
of
a
depleted
public
treasury
and
the
imperative
demand
of
the
people
for
economy
in
the
administration
of
their
government
the
secretary
has
entered
upon
the
task
of
rationally
reducing
expenditures
by
the
elimination
from
the
pay
rolls
of
all
persons
not
needed
for
an
efficient
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
department
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
year
the
expenses
of
the
department
aggregated
as
against
for
the
corresponding
period
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
the
secretary
makes
apparent
his
intention
to
continue
this
rate
of
reduction
by
submitting
estimates
for
the
next
fiscal
year
less
by
than
those
for
the
present
year
among
the
heads
of
divisions
in
this
department
the
changes
have
been
exceedingly
few
three
vacancies
occurring
from
death
and
resignations
have
been
filled
by
the
promotion
of
assistants
in
the
same
divisions
these
promotions
of
experienced
and
faithful
assistants
have
not
only
been
in
the
interest
of
efficient
work
but
have
suggested
to
those
in
the
department
who
look
for
retention
and
promotion
that
merit
and
devotion
to
duty
are
their
best
reliance
the
amount
appropriated
for
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
for
the
current
fiscal
year
is
the
estimate
for
the
ensuing
year
is
the
regulations
of
concerning
texas
fever
have
been
enforced
during
the
last
year
and
the
large
stock
yards
of
the
country
have
been
kept
free
from
infection
occasional
local
outbreaks
have
been
largely
such
as
could
have
been
effectually
guarded
against
by
the
owners
of
the
affected
cattle
while
contagious
pleuropneumonia
in
cattle
has
been
eradicated
animal
tuberculosis
a
disease
widespread
and
more
dangerous
to
human
life
than
pleuropneumonia
is
still
prevalent
investigations
have
been
made
during
the
past
year
as
to
the
means
of
its
communication
and
the
method
of
its
correct
diagnosis
much
progress
has
been
made
in
this
direction
by
the
studies
of
the
division
of
animal
pathology
but
work
ought
to
be
extended
in
cooperation
with
local
authorities
until
the
danger
to
human
life
arising
from
this
cause
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
the
number
of
animals
arriving
from
canada
during
the
year
and
inspected
by
bureau
officers
was
and
the
number
from
transatlantic
countries
was
no
contagious
diseases
were
found
among
the
imported
animals
the
total
number
of
inspections
of
cattle
for
export
during
the
past
fiscal
year
was
the
exports
show
a
falling
off
of
about
per
cent
from
the
preceding
year
the
decrease
occurring
entirely
in
the
last
half
of
the
year
this
suggests
that
the
falling
off
may
have
been
largely
due
to
an
increase
in
the
price
of
american
export
cattle
during
the
year
ending
june
exports
of
inspected
pork
aggregated
pounds
as
against
pounds
for
the
preceding
year
the
falling
off
in
this
export
was
not
confined
however
to
inspected
pork
the
total
quantity
exported
for
being
pounds
while
in
it
was
only
pounds
i
join
the
secretary
in
recommending
that
hereafter
each
applicant
for
the
position
of
inspector
or
assistant
inspector
in
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
be
required
as
a
condition
precedent
to
his
appointment
to
exhibit
to
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
his
diploma
from
an
established
regular
and
reputable
veterinary
college
and
that
this
be
supplemented
by
such
an
examination
in
veterinary
science
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
the
exports
of
agricultural
products
from
the
united
states
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
attained
the
enormous
figure
of
in
round
numbers
being
per
cent
of
our
total
exports
in
the
last
fiscal
year
this
aggregate
was
greatly
reduced
but
nevertheless
reached
being
per
cent
of
all
american
commodities
exported
a
review
of
our
agricultural
exports
with
special
reference
to
their
desti
nation
will
show
that
in
almost
every
line
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
absorbs
by
far
the
largest
proportion
of
cattle
the
total
exports
aggregated
in
value
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
of
which
great
britain
took
considerably
over
of
beef
products
of
all
kinds
our
total
exports
were
of
which
great
britain
took
of
pork
products
the
total
exports
were
of
which
great
britain
took
in
breadstuffs
cotton
and
minor
products
like
proportions
sent
to
the
same
destination
are
shown
the
work
of
the
statistical
division
of
the
department
of
agriculture
deals
with
all
that
relates
to
the
economics
of
farming
the
main
purpose
of
its
monthly
reports
is
to
keep
the
farmers
informed
as
fully
as
possible
of
all
matters
having
any
influence
upon
the
worlds
markets
in
which
their
products
find
sale
its
publications
relate
especially
to
the
commercial
side
of
farming
it
is
therefore
of
profound
importance
and
vital
concern
to
the
farmers
of
the
united
states
who
represent
nearly
onehalf
of
our
population
and
also
of
direct
interest
to
the
whole
country
that
the
work
of
this
division
be
efficiently
performed
and
that
the
information
it
has
gathered
be
promptly
diffused
it
is
a
matter
for
congratulation
to
know
that
the
secretary
will
not
spare
any
effort
to
make
this
part
of
his
work
thoroughly
useful
in
the
year
the
congress
appropriated
to
be
taken
from
the
patent
office
funds
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
and
distributing
rare
and
improved
varieties
of
seeds
and
for
prosecuting
agricultural
investigations
and
procuring
agricultural
statistics
from
this
small
beginning
the
seed
division
of
the
department
of
agriculture
has
grown
to
its
present
unwieldy
and
unjustifiably
extravagant
proportions
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
cost
of
seeds
purchased
was
the
remainder
of
an
appropriation
of
was
expended
in
putting
them
up
and
distributing
them
it
surely
never
could
have
entered
the
minds
of
those
who
first
sanctioned
appropriations
of
public
money
for
the
purchase
of
new
and
improved
varieties
of
seeds
for
gratuitous
distribution
that
from
this
would
grow
large
appropriations
for
the
purchase
and
distribution
by
members
of
congress
of
ordinary
seeds
bulbs
and
cuttings
which
are
common
in
all
the
states
and
territories
and
everywhere
easily
obtainable
at
low
prices
in
each
state
and
territory
an
agricultural
experiment
station
has
been
established
these
stations
by
their
very
character
and
name
are
the
proper
agencies
to
experiment
with
and
test
new
varieties
of
seeds
and
yet
this
indiscriminate
and
wasteful
distribution
by
legislation
and
legislators
continues
answering
no
purpose
unless
it
be
to
remind
constituents
that
their
representatives
are
willing
to
remember
them
with
gratuities
at
public
cost
under
the
sanction
of
existing
legislation
there
was
sent
out
from
the
agricultural
department
during
the
last
fiscal
year
enough
of
cabbage
seed
to
plant
acres
of
land
a
sufficient
quantity
of
beans
to
plant
acres
beet
seed
enough
to
plant
acres
sweet
corn
enough
to
plant
acres
sufficient
cucumber
seed
to
cover
acres
with
vines
and
enough
muskmelon
and
watermelon
seeds
to
plant
acres
the
total
quantity
of
flower
and
vegetable
seeds
thus
distributed
was
contained
in
more
than
packages
and
they
were
sufficient
if
planted
to
cover
acres
of
land
in
view
of
these
facts
this
enormous
expenditure
without
legitimate
returns
of
benefit
ought
to
be
abolished
anticipating
a
consummation
so
manifestly
in
the
interest
of
good
administration
more
than
has
been
stricken
from
the
estimate
made
to
cover
this
object
for
the
year
ending
june
and
the
secretary
recommends
that
the
remaining
of
the
estimate
be
confined
strictly
to
the
purchase
of
new
and
improved
varieties
of
seeds
and
that
these
be
distributed
through
experiment
stations
thus
the
seed
will
be
tested
and
after
the
test
has
been
completed
by
the
experiment
station
the
propagation
of
the
useful
varieties
and
the
rejection
of
the
valueless
may
safely
be
left
to
the
common
sense
of
the
people
the
continued
intelligent
execution
of
the
civilservice
law
and
the
increasing
approval
by
the
people
of
its
operation
are
most
gratifying
the
recent
extension
of
its
limitations
and
regulations
to
the
employees
at
freedelivery
postoffices
which
has
been
honestly
and
promptly
accomplished
by
the
commission
with
the
hearty
cooperation
of
the
postmastergeneral
is
an
immensely
important
advance
in
the
usefulness
of
the
system
i
am
if
possible
more
than
ever
convinced
of
the
incalculable
benefits
conferred
by
the
civilservice
law
not
only
in
its
effect
upon
the
public
service
but
also
what
is
even
more
important
in
its
effect
in
elevating
the
tone
of
political
life
generally
the
course
of
civilservice
reform
in
this
country
instructively
and
interestingly
illustrates
how
strong
a
hold
a
movement
gains
upon
our
people
which
has
underlying
it
a
sentiment
of
justice
and
right
and
which
at
the
same
time
promises
better
administration
of
their
government
the
law
embodying
this
reform
found
its
way
to
our
statute
book
more
from
fear
of
the
popular
sentiment
existing
in
its
favor
than
from
any
love
for
the
reform
itself
on
the
part
of
legislators
and
it
has
lived
and
grown
and
flourished
in
spite
of
the
covert
as
well
as
open
hostility
of
spoilsmen
and
notwithstanding
the
querulous
impracticability
of
many
selfconstituted
guardians
beneath
all
the
vagaries
and
sublimated
theories
which
are
attracted
to
it
there
underlies
this
reform
a
sturdy
commonsense
principle
not
only
suited
to
this
mundane
sphere
but
whose
application
our
people
are
more
and
more
recognizing
to
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
most
successful
operation
of
their
government
if
not
to
its
perpetuity
it
seems
to
me
to
be
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
this
reform
as
well
as
with
its
best
enforcement
to
oblige
the
commission
to
rely
for
clerical
assistance
upon
clerks
detailed
from
other
departments
there
ought
not
to
be
such
a
condition
in
any
department
that
clerks
hired
to
do
work
there
can
be
spared
to
habitually
work
at
another
place
and
it
does
not
accord
with
a
sensible
view
of
civilservice
reform
that
persons
should
be
employed
on
the
theory
that
their
labor
is
necessary
in
one
department
when
in
point
of
fact
their
services
are
devoted
to
entirely
different
work
in
another
department
i
earnestly
urge
that
the
clerks
necessary
to
carry
on
the
work
of
the
commission
be
regularly
put
upon
its
roster
and
that
the
system
of
obliging
the
commissioners
to
rely
upon
the
services
of
clerks
belonging
to
other
departments
be
discontinued
this
ought
not
to
increase
the
expense
to
the
government
while
it
would
certainly
be
more
consistent
and
add
greatly
to
the
efficiency
of
the
commission
economy
in
public
expenditure
is
a
duty
that
can
not
innocently
be
neglected
by
those
intrusted
with
the
control
of
money
drawn
from
the
people
for
public
uses
it
must
be
confessed
that
our
apparently
endless
resources
the
familiarity
of
our
people
with
immense
accumulations
of
wealth
the
growing
sentiment
among
them
that
the
expenditure
of
public
money
should
in
some
manner
be
to
their
immediate
and
personal
advantage
the
indirect
and
almost
stealthy
manner
in
which
a
large
part
of
our
taxes
is
exacted
and
a
degenerated
sense
of
official
accountability
have
led
to
growing
extravagance
in
governmental
appropriations
at
this
time
when
a
depleted
public
treasury
confronts
us
when
many
of
our
people
are
engaged
in
a
hard
struggle
for
the
necessaries
of
life
and
when
enforced
economy
is
pressing
upon
the
great
mass
of
our
countrymen
i
desire
to
urge
with
all
the
earnestness
at
my
command
that
congressional
legislation
be
so
limited
by
strict
economy
as
to
exhibit
an
appreciation
of
the
condition
of
the
treasury
and
a
sympathy
with
the
straitened
circumstances
of
our
fellowcitizens
the
duty
of
public
economy
is
also
of
immense
importance
in
its
intimate
and
necessary
relation
to
the
task
now
in
hand
of
providing
revenue
to
meet
government
expenditures
and
yet
reducing
the
peoples
burden
of
federal
taxation
after
a
hard
struggle
tariff
reform
is
directly
before
us
nothing
so
important
claims
our
attention
and
nothing
so
clearly
presents
itself
as
both
an
opportunity
and
a
dutyan
opportunity
to
deserve
the
gratitude
of
our
fellowcitizens
and
a
duty
imposed
upon
us
by
our
oftrepeated
professions
and
by
the
emphatic
mandate
of
the
people
after
full
discussion
our
countrymen
have
spoken
in
favor
of
this
reform
and
they
have
confided
the
work
of
its
accomplishment
to
the
hands
of
those
who
are
solemnly
pledged
to
it
if
there
is
anything
in
the
theory
of
a
representation
in
public
places
of
the
people
and
their
desires
if
public
officers
are
really
the
servants
of
the
people
and
if
political
promises
and
professions
have
any
binding
force
our
failure
to
give
the
relief
so
long
awaited
will
be
sheer
recreancy
nothing
should
intervene
to
distract
our
attention
or
disturb
our
effort
until
this
reform
is
accomplished
by
wise
and
careful
legislation
while
we
should
stanchly
adhere
to
the
principle
that
only
the
necessity
of
revenue
justifies
the
imposition
of
tariff
duties
and
other
federal
taxation
and
that
they
should
be
limited
by
strict
economy
we
can
not
close
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
conditions
have
grown
up
among
us
which
in
justice
and
fairness
call
for
discriminating
care
in
the
distribution
of
such
duties
and
taxation
as
the
emergencies
of
our
government
actually
demand
manifestly
if
we
are
to
aid
the
people
directly
through
tariff
reform
one
of
its
most
obvious
features
should
be
a
reduction
in
present
tariff
charges
upon
the
necessaries
of
life
the
benefits
of
such
a
reduction
would
be
palpable
and
substantial
seen
and
felt
by
thousands
who
would
be
better
fed
and
better
clothed
and
better
sheltered
these
gifts
should
be
the
willing
benefactions
of
a
government
whose
highest
function
is
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
the
people
not
less
closely
related
to
our
peoples
prosperity
and
wellbeing
is
the
removal
of
restrictions
upon
the
im
portation
of
the
raw
materials
necessary
to
our
manufactures
the
world
should
be
open
to
our
national
ingenuity
and
enterprise
this
can
not
be
while
federal
legislation
through
the
imposition
of
high
tariff
forbids
to
american
manufacturers
as
cheap
materials
as
those
used
by
their
competitors
it
is
quite
obvious
that
the
enhancement
of
the
price
of
our
manufactured
products
resulting
from
this
policy
not
only
confines
the
market
for
these
products
within
our
own
borders
to
the
direct
disadvantage
of
our
manufacturers
but
also
increases
their
cost
to
our
citizens
the
interests
of
labor
are
certainly
though
indirectly
involved
in
this
feature
of
our
tariff
system
the
sharp
competition
and
active
struggle
among
our
manufacturers
to
supply
the
limited
demand
for
their
goods
soon
fill
the
narrow
market
to
which
they
are
confined
then
follows
a
suspension
of
work
in
mills
and
factories
a
discharge
of
employees
and
distress
in
the
homes
of
our
workingmen
even
if
the
oftendisproved
assertion
could
be
made
good
that
a
lower
rate
of
wages
would
result
from
free
raw
materials
and
low
tariff
duties
the
intelligence
of
our
workmen
leads
them
quickly
to
discover
that
their
steady
employment
permitted
by
free
raw
materials
is
the
most
important
factor
in
their
relation
to
tariff
legislation
a
measure
has
been
prepared
by
the
appropriate
congressional
committee
embodying
tariff
reform
on
the
lines
herein
suggested
which
will
be
promptly
submitted
for
legislative
action
it
is
the
result
of
much
patriotic
and
unselfish
work
and
i
believe
it
deals
with
its
subject
consistently
and
as
thoroughly
as
existing
conditions
permit
i
am
satisfied
that
the
reduced
tariff
duties
provided
for
in
the
proposed
legislation
added
to
existing
internalrevenue
taxation
will
in
the
near
future
though
perhaps
not
immediately
produce
sufficient
revenue
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
government
the
committee
after
full
consideration
and
to
provide
against
a
temporary
deficiency
which
may
exist
before
the
business
of
the
country
adjusts
itself
to
the
new
tariff
schedules
have
wisely
embraced
in
their
plan
a
few
additional
internalrevenue
taxes
including
a
small
tax
upon
incomes
derived
from
certain
corporate
investments
these
new
adjustments
are
not
only
absolutely
just
and
easily
borne
but
they
have
the
further
merit
of
being
such
as
can
be
remitted
without
unfavorable
business
disturbance
whenever
the
necessity
of
their
imposition
no
longer
exists
in
my
great
desire
for
the
success
of
this
measure
i
can
not
restrain
the
suggestion
that
its
success
can
only
be
attained
by
means
of
unselfish
counsel
on
the
part
of
the
friends
of
tariff
reform
and
as
a
result
of
their
willingness
to
subordinate
personal
desires
and
ambitions
to
the
general
good
the
local
interests
affected
by
the
proposed
reform
are
so
numerous
and
so
varied
that
if
all
are
insisted
upon
the
legislation
embodying
the
reform
must
inevitably
fail
in
conclusion
my
intense
feeling
of
responsibility
impels
me
to
invoke
for
the
manifold
interests
of
a
generous
and
confiding
people
the
most
scrupulous
care
and
to
pledge
my
willing
support
to
every
legislative
effort
for
the
advancement
of
the
greatness
and
prosperity
of
our
beloved
country

the
discharge

the
duties
you
have
assumed
as
the

generous

your
meeting
is
marked
by
an
interesting
and
impressive
incident
with
the
expiration
of
the
present
session
of
the
congress
the
first
century
of
our
constitutional
existence
as
a
nation
will
be
completed
our
survival
for
one
hundred

is
not
sufficient
to
assure
us
that
we
no

have
dangers
to
fear
in
the
maintenance
with
all
its
promised
blessings
of
a
government
rounded
upon
the
freedom
of

the

rather
admonishes
us
to
soberly
inquire
whether
in
the
past
we
have
always
closely
kept
in
the
course
of
safety
and
whether
we
have
before
us
a
way
plain
and
clear
which
leads
to
happiness

of

the
chart
adopted
for
our
guidance
was
the

departure
from
the

there
laid
down
is
failure
it
is
only
by
a
strict
adherence
to
the
direction
they
indicate
and
by
restraint
within
the
limitations
they
fix
that
we
can
furnish
proof
to
the
world
of
the
fitness
of
the
american
people
for
selfgovernment
the
equal
and
exact
justice
of
which
we
boast
as
the
underlying
principle
of
our
institutions
should
not

the

of

to

the

that
in
the
exercise
of
its
functions
and
powers
it
will
deal
with
the
body
of
our
citizens
in
a
manner
scrupulously
honest
and
fair
and
absolutely
just
it
has
agreed
that
american
citizenship
shall
be
the
only
credential
necessary
to
justify
the
claim
of
equality
before
the
law
and
that
no
condition
in
life
shall
give
rise
to
discrimination
in
the
treatment
of
the
people
by
their
government
the
citizen
of
our
republic
in
its
early
days
rigidly
insisted
upon
full
compliance
with
the
letter
of
this
bond
and
saw
stretching
out
before
him
a
clear
field
for
individual
endeavor
his
tribute
to
the
support
of
his
government
was
measured
by
the
cost
of
its
economical
maintenance
and
he
was
secure
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
remaining
recompense
of
his
steady
and
contented
toil
in
those
days
the
frugality
of
the
people
was
stamped
upon
their
government
and
was
enforced
by
the

and
intelligent
suffrage
of

are
the
abiding
places
of

and
luxury

fortunes
never
dreamed
of
by
the
fathers
of
the

our
business
men
are
madly
striving
in
the
race
for
riches
and
immense
aggregations
of
capital
outrun
the
imagination
in
the
magnitude
of
their
undertakings
we
view
with
pride
and
satisfaction
this
bright
picture
of
our
countrys
growth
and
prosperity
while
only
a
closer
scrutiny
develops
a
somber
shading
upon
more
careful
inspection
we
find
the
wealth
and
luxury
of
our
cities
mingled
with
poverty
and
wretchedness
and
unremunerative
toil
a
crowded
and
constantly
increasing
urban
population
suggests
the
impoverishment
of
rural
sections
and
discontent
with
agricultural
pursuits
the
farmers
son
not
satisfied
with
his

simple
and
laborious
life
joins
the
eager
chase
for
easily
acquired
wealth
we
discover
that
the
fortunes
realized
by
our
manufacturers
are
no
longer
solely
the
reward
of
sturdy
industry
and
enlightened
foresight
but
that
they
result
from
the
discriminating
favor
of
the
government
and
are
largely
built
upon
undue
exactions
from
the
masses
of
our
people
the
gulf
between
employers
and
the
employed
is
constantly
widening
and
classes
are
rapidly
forming
one
comprising
the
very
rich
and
powerful
while
in
another
are
found
the
toiling
poor
as
we
view
the
achievements
of
aggregated
capital
we
discover
the
existence
of
trusts
combinations
and
monopolies
while
the
citizen
is
struggling
far
in
the
rear
or
is
trampled
to
death
beneath
an
iron
heel
corporations
which
should
be
the
carefully
restrained
creatures
of
the
law
and
the
servants
of
the
people
are
fast
becoming
the
peoples
masters
still
congratulating
ourselves
upon
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
our
country
and
complacently
contemplating
every
incident
of
change
inseparable
from
these
conditions
it
is
our
duty
as
patriotic
citizens
to
inquire
at
the
present
stage
of
our
progress
how
the
bond
of
the
government
made
with
the
people
has
been
kept
and
performed
instead
of
limiting
the
tribute
drawn
from
our
citizens
to
the
necessities
of
its
economical
administration
the
government
persists
in
exacting
from
the
substance
of
the
people
millions
which
unapplied
and
useless
lie
dormant
in
its
treasury
this
flagrant
injustice
and
this
breach
of
faith
and
obligation
add
to
extortion
the
danger
attending
the
diversion
of
the
currency
of
the
country
from
the
legitimate
channels
of
business
under
the
same
laws
by
which
these
results
are
produced
the
government
permits
many
millions
more
to
be
added
to
the
cost
of
the
living
of
our
people
and
to
be
taken
from
our
consumers
which
unreasonably
swell
the
profits
of
a
small
but
powerful
minority
the
people
must
still
be
taxed
for
the
support
of
the
government
under
the
operation
of
tariff
laws
but
to
the
extent
that
the
mass
of
our
citizens
are
inordinately
burdened
beyond
any
useful
public
purpose
and
for
the
benefit
of
a
favored
few
the
government
under
pretext
of
an
exercise
of
its
taxing
power
enters
gratuitously
into
partnership
with
these
favorites
to
their
advantage
and
to
the
injury
of
a
vast
majority
of
our
people
this
is
not
equality
before
the
law
the
existing
situation
is
injurious
to
the
health
of
our
entire
body
politic
it
stifles
in
those
for
whose
benefit
it
is
permitted
all
patriotic
love
of
country
and
substitutes
in
its
place
selfish
greed
and
grasping
avarice
devotion
to
american
citizenship
for
its
own
sake
and
for
what
it
should
accomplish
as
a
motive
to
our
nations
advancement
and
the
happiness
of
all
our
people
is
displaced
by
the
assumption
that
the
government
instead
of
being
the
embodiment
of
equality
is
but
an
instrumentality
through
which
especial
and
individual
advantages
are
to
be
gained
the
arrogance
of
this
assumption
is
unconcealed
it
appears
in
the
sordid
disregard
of
all
but
personal
interests
in
the
refusal
to
abate
for
the
benefit
of
others
one
iota
of
selfish
advantage
and
in
combinations
to
perpetuate
such
advantages
through
efforts
to
control
legislation
and
improperly
influence
the
suffrages
of
the
people
the
grievances
of
those
not
included
within
the
circle
of
these
beneficiaries
when
fully
realized
will
surely
arouse
irritation
and
discontent
our
farmers
long
suffering
and
patient
struggling
in
the
race
of
life
with
the
hardest
and
most
unremitting
toil
will
not
fail
to
see
in
spite
of
misrepresentations
and
misleading
fallacies
that
they
are
obliged
to
accept
such
prices
for
their
products
as
are
fixed
in
foreign
markets
where
they
compete
with
the
farmers
of
the
world
that
their
lands
are
declining
in
value
while
their
debts
increase
and
that
without
compensating
favor
they
are
forced
by
the
action
of
the
government
to
pay
for
the
benefit
of
others
such
enhanced
prices
for
the
things
they
need
that
the
scanty
returns
of
their
labor
fail
to
furnish
their
support
or
leave
no
margin
for
accumulation
our
workingmen
enfranchised
from
all
delusions
and
no
longer
frightened
by
the
cry
that
their
wages
are
endangered
by
a
just
revision
of
our
tariff
laws
will
reasonably
demand
through
such
revision
steadier
employment
cheaper
means
of
living
in
their
homes
freedom
for
themselves
and
their
children
from
the
doom
of
perpetual
servitude
and
an
open
door
to
their
advancement
beyond
the
limits
of
a
laboring
class
others
of
our
citizens
whose
comforts
and
expenditures
are
measured
by
moderate
salaries
and
fixed
incomes
will
insist
upon
the
fairness
and
justice
of
cheapening
the
cost
of
necessaries
for
themselves
and
their
families
when
to
the
selfishness
of
the
beneficiaries
of
unjust
discrimination
under
our
laws
there
shall
be
added
the
discontent
of
those
who
suffer
from
such
discrimination
we
will
realize
the
fact
that
the
beneficent
purposes
of
our
government
dependent
upon
the
patriotism
and
contentment
of
our
people
are
endangered
communism
is
a
hateful
thing
and
a
menace
to
peace
and
organized
government
but
the
communism
of
combined
wealth
and
capital
the
outgrowth
of
overweening
cupidity
and
selfishness
which
insidiously
undermines
the
justice
and
integrity
of
free
institutions
is
not
less
dangerous
than
the
communism
of
oppressed
poverty
and
toil
which
exasperated
by
injustice
and
discontent
attacks
with
wild
disorder
the
citadel
of
rule
he
mocks
the
people
who
proposes
that
the
government
shall
protect
the
rich
and
that
they
in
turn
will
care
for
the
laboring
poor
any
intermediary
between
the
people
and
their
government
or
the
least
delegation
of
the
care
and
protection
the
government
owes
to
the
humblest
citizen
in
the
land
makes
the
boast
of
free
institutions
a
glittering
delusion
and
the
pretended
boon
of
american
citizenship
a
shameless
imposition
a
just
and
sensible
revision
of
our
tariff
laws
should
be
made
for
the
relief
of
those
of
our
countrymen
who
suffer
under
present
conditions
such
a
revision
should
receive
the
support
of
all
who
love
that
justice
and
equality
due
to
american
citizenship
of
all
who
realize
that
in
this
justice
and
equality
our
government
finds
its
strength
and
its
power
to
protect
the
citizen
and
his
property
of
all
who
believe
that
the
contented
competence
and
comfort
of
many
accord
better
with
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
than
colossal
fortunes
unfairly
gathered
in
the
hands
of

a
few
of
all
who
appreciate
that
the
forbearance
and
fraternity
among
our
people
which
recognize
the
value
of
every
american
interest
are
the
surest
guaranty
of
our
national
progress
and
of
all
who
desire
to
see
the
products
of
american
skill
and
ingenuity
in
every
market
of
the
world
with
a
resulting
restoration
of
american
commerce
the
necessity
of
the
reduction
of
our
revenues
is
so
apparent
as
to
be
generally
conceded
but
the
means
by
which
this
end
shall
be
accomplished
and
the
sum
of
direct
benefit
which
shall
result
to
our
citizens
present
a
controversy
of
the
utmost
importance
there
should
be
no
scheme
accepted
as
satisfactory
by
which
the
burdens
of
the
people
are
only
apparently
removed
extravagant
appropriations
of
public
money
with
all
their
demoralizing
consequences
should
not
be
tolerated
either
as
a
means
of
relieving
the
treasury
of
its
present
surplus
or
as
furnishing
pretext
for
resisting
a
proper
reduction
in
tariff
rates
existing
evils
and
injustice
should
be
honestly
recognized
boldly
met
and
effectively
remedied
there
should
be
no
cessation
of
the
struggle
until
a
plan
is
perfected
fair
and
conservative
toward
existing
industries
but
which
will
reduce
the
cost
to
consumers
of
the
necessaries
of
life
while
it
provides
for
our
manufacturers
the
advantage
of
freer
raw
materials
and
permits
no
injury
to
the
interests
of
american
labor
the
cause
for
which
the
battle
is
waged
is
comprised
within
lines
clearly
and
distinctly
defined
it
should
never
be
compromised
it
is
the
peoples
cause
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
selfish
and
private
interests
which
are
so
persistently
heard
when
efforts
are
made
to
deal
in
a
just
and
comprehensive
manner
with
our
tariff
laws
are
related
to
if
they
are
not
responsible
for
the
sentiment
largely
prevailing
among
the
people
that
the
general
government
is
the
fountain
of
individual
and
private
aid
that
it
may
be
expected
to
relieve
with
paternal
care
the
distress
of
citizens
and
communities
and
that
from
the
fullness
of
its
treasury
it
should
upon
the
slightest
possible
pretext
of
promoting
the
general
good
apply
public
funds
to
the
benefit
of
localities
and
individuals
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
there
is
a
growing
assumption
that
as
against
the
government
and
in
favor
of
private
claims
and
interests
the
usual
rules
and
limitations
of
business
principles
and
just
dealing
should
be
waived
these
ideas
have
been
unhappily
much
encouraged
by
legislative
acquiescence
relief
from
contracts
made
with
the
government
is
too
easily
accorded
in
favor
of
the
citizen
the
failure
to
support
claims
against
the
government
by
proof
is
often
supplied
by
no
better
consideration
than
the
wealth
of
the
government
and
the
poverty
of
the
claimant
gratuities
in
the
form
of
pensions
are
granted
upon
no
other
real
ground
than
the
needy
condition
of
the
applicant
or
for
reasons
less
valid
and
large
sums
are
expended
for
public
buildings
and
other
improvements
upon
representations
scarcely
claimed
to
be
related
to
public
needs
and
necessities
the
extent
to
which
the
consideration
of
such
matters
subordinate
and
postpone
action
upon
subjects
of
great
public
importance
but
involving
no
special
private
or
partisan
interest
should
arrest
attention
and
lead
to
reformation
a
few
of
the
numerous
illustrations
of
this
condition
may
be
stated
the
crowded
condition
of
the
calendar
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
delay
to
suitors
and
denial
of
justice
resulting
therefrom
has
been
strongly
urged
upon
the
attention
of
the
congress
with
a
plan
for
the
relief
of
the
situation
approved
by
those
well
able
to
judge
of
its
merits
while
this
subject
remains
without
effective
consideration
many
laws
have
been
passed
providing
for
the
holding
of
terms
of
inferior
courts
at
places
to
suit
the
convenience
of
localities
or
to
lay
the
foundation
of
an
application
for
the
erection
of
a
new
public
building
repeated
recommendations
have
been
submitted
for
the
amendment
and
change
of
the
laws
relating
to
our
public
lands
so
that
their
spoliation
and
diversion
to
other
uses
than
as
homes
for
honest
settlers
might
be
prevented
while
a
measure
to
meet
this
conceded
necessity
of
reform
remains
awaiting
the
action
of
the
congress
many
claims
to
the
public
lands
and
applications
for
their
donation
in
favor
of
states
and
individuals
have
been
allowed
a
plan
in
aid
of
indian
management
recommended
by
those
well
informed
as
containing
valuable
features
in
furtherance
of
the
solution
of
the
indian
problem
has
thus
far
failed
of
legislative
sanction
while
grants
of
doubtful
expediency
to
railroad
corporations
permitting
them
to
pass
through
indian
reservations
have
greatly
multiplied
the
propriety
and
necessity
of
the
erection
of
one
or
more
prisons
for
the
confinement
of
united
states
convicts
and
a
postoffice
building
in
the
national
capital
are
not
disputed
but
these
needs
yet
remain
answered
while
scores
of
public
buildings
have
been
erected
where
their
necessity
for
public
purposes
is
not
apparent
a
revision
of
our
pension
laws
could
easily
be
made
which
would
rest
upon
just
principles
and
provide
for
every
worthy
applicant
but
while
our
general
pension
laws
remain
confused
and
imperfect
hundreds
of
private
pension
laws
are
annually
passed
which
are
the
sources
of
unjust
discrimination
and
popular
demoralization
appropriation
bills
for
the
support
of
the
government
are
defaced
by
items
and
provisions
to
meet
private
ends
and
it
is
freely
asserted
by
responsible
and
experienced
parties
that
a
bill
appropriating
money
for
public
internal
improvement
would
fail
to
meet
with
favor
unless
it
contained
items
more
for
local
and
private
advantage
than
for
public
benefit
these
statements
can
be
much
emphasized
by
an
ascertainment
of
the
proportion
of
federal
legislation
which
either
bears
upon
its
face
its
private
character
or
which
upon
examination
develops
such
a
motive
power
and
yet
the
people
wait
and
expect
from
their
chosen
representatives
such
patriotic
action
as
will
advance
the
welfare
of
the
entire
country
and
this
expectation
can
only
be
answered
by
the
performance
of
public
duty
with
unselfish
purpose
our
mission
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
our
success
in
accomplishing
the
work
god
has
given
the
american
people
to
do
require
of
those
intrusted
with
the
making
and
execution
of
our
laws
perfect
devotion
above
all
other
things
to
the
public
good
this
devotion
will
lead
us
to
strongly
resist
all
impatience
of
constitutional
limitations
of
federal
power
and
to
persistently
check
the
increasing
tendency
to
extend
the
scope
of
federal
legislation
into
the
domain
of
state
and
local
jurisdiction
upon
the
plea
of
subserving
the
public
welfare
the
preservation
of
the
partitions
between
proper
subjects
of
federal
and
local
care
and
regulation
is
of
such
importance
under
the
constitution
which
is
the
law
of
our
very
existence
that
no
consideration
of
expediency
or
sentiment
should
tempt
us
to
enter
upon
doubtful
ground
we
have
undertaken
to
discover
and
proclaim
the
richest
blessings
of
a
free
government
with
the
constitution
as
our
guide
let
us
follow
the
way
it
points
out
it
will
not
mislead
us
and
surely
no
one
who
has
taken
upon
himself
the
solemn
obligation
to
support
and
preserve
the
constitution
can
find
justification
or
solace
for
disloyalty
in
the
excuse
that
he
wandered
and
disobeyed
in
search
of
a
better
way
to
reach
the
public
welfare
than
the
constitution
offers
what
has
been
said
is
deemed
not
inappropriate
at
a
time
when
from
a
centurys
height
we
view
the
way
already
trod
by
the
american
people
and
attempt
to
discover
their
future
path
the
seventh
president
of
the
united
statesthe
soldier
and
statesman
and
at
all
times
the
firm
and
brave
friend
of
the
peoplein
vindication
of
his
course
as
the
protector
of
popular
rights
and
the
champion
of
true
american
citizenship
declared
the
ambition
which
leads
me
on
is
an
anxious
desire
and
a
fixed
determination
to
restore
to
the
people
unimpaired
the
sacred
trust
they
have
confided
to
my
charge
to
heal
the
wounds
of
the
constitution
and
to
preserve
it
from
further
violation
to
persuade
my
countrymen
so
far
as
i
may
that
it
is
not
in
a
splendid
government
supported
by
powerful
monopolies
and
aristocratical
establishments
that
they
will
find
happiness
or
their
liberties
protection
but
in
a
plain
system
void
of
pomp
protecting
all
and
granting
favors
to
none
dispensing
its
blessings
like
the
dews
of
heaven
unseen
and
unfelt
save
in
the
freshness
and
beauty
they
contribute
to
produce
it
is
such
a
government
that
the
genius
of
our
people
requiressuch
an
one
only
under
which
our
states
may
remain
for
ages
to
come
united
prosperous
and
free
in
pursuance
of
a
constitutional
provision
requiring
the
president
from
time
to
time
to
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
announce
that
the
close
of
the
year
finds
the
united
states
in
the
enjoyment
of
domestic
tranquillity
and
at
peace
with
all
the
nations
since
my
last
annual
message
our
foreign
relations
have
been
strengthened
and
improved
by
performance
of
international
good
offices
and
by
new
and
renewed
treaties
of
amity
commerce
and
reciprocal
extradition
of
criminals
those
international
questions
which
still
await
settlement
are
all
reasonably
within
the
domain
of
amicable
negotiation
and
there
is
no
existing
subject
of
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
any
foreign
power
that
is
not
susceptible
of
satisfactory
adjustment
by
frank
diplomatic
treatment
the
questions
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
relating
to
the
rights
of
american
fishermen
under
treaty
and
international
comity
in
the
territorial
waters
of
canada
and
newfoundland
i
regret
to
say
are
not
yet
satisfactorily
adjusted
these
matters
were
fully
treated
in
my
message
to
the
senate
of
february
together
with
which
a
convention
concluded
under
my
authority
with
her
majestys
government
on
the
th
of
february
last
for
the
removal
of
all
causes
of
misunderstanding
was
submitted
by
me
for
the
approval
of
the
senate
this
tr
eaty
having
been
rejected
by
the
senate
i
transmitted
a
message
to
the
congress
on
the
d
of
august
last
reviewing
the
transactions
and
submitting
for
consideration
certain
recommendations
for
legislation
concerning
the
important
questions
involved
afterwards
on
the
th
of
september
in
response
to
a
resolution
of
the
senate
i
again
communicated
fully
all
the
information
in
my
possession
as
to
the
action
of
the
government
of
canada
affecting
the
commercial
relations
between
the
dominion
and
the
united
states
including
the
treatment
of
american
fishing
vessels
in
the
ports
and
waters
of
british
north
america
these
communications
have
all
been
published
and
therefore
opened
to
the
knowledge
of
both
houses
of
congress
although
two
were
addressed
to
the
senate
alone
comment
upon
or
repetition
of
their
contents
would
be
superfluous
and
i
am
not
aware
that
anything
has
since
occurred
which
should
be
added
to
the
facts
therein
stated
therefore
i
merely
repeat
as
applicable
to
the
present
time
the
statement
which
will
be
found
in
my
message
to
the
senate
of
september
last
thatsince
march
no
case
has
been
reported
to
the
department
of
state
wherein
complaint
was
made
of
unfriendly
or
unlawful
treatment
of
american
fishing
vessels
on
the
part
of
the
canadian
authorities
in
which
reparation
was
not
promptly
and
satisfactorily
obtained
by
the
united
states
consulgeneral
at
halifax
having
essayed
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
to
procure
by
negotiation
the
settlement
of
a
longstanding
cause
of
dispute
and
to
remove
a
constant
menace
to
the
good
relations
of
the
two
countries
and
continuing
to
be
of
opinion
that
the
treaty
of
february
last
which
failed
to
receive
the
approval
of
the
senate
did
supply
a
satisfactory
practical
and
final
adjustment
upon
a
basis
honorable
and
just
to
both
parties
of
the
difficult
and
vexed
question
to
which
it
related
and
having
subsequently
and
unavailingly
recommended
other
legislation
to
congress
which
i
hoped
would
suffice
to
meet
the
exigency
created
by
the
rejection
of
the
treaty
i
now
again
invoke
the
earnest
and
immediate
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
condition
of
this
important
question
as
it
now
stands
before
them
and
the
country
and
for
the
settlement
of
which
i
am
deeply
solicitous
near
the
close
of
the
month
of
october
last
occurrences
of
a
deeply
regrettable
nature
were
brought
to
my
knowledge
which
made
it
my
painful
but
imperative
duty
to
obtain
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
a
new
personal
channel
of
diplomatic
intercourse
in
this
country
with
the
government
of
great
britain
the
correspondence
in
relation
to
this
incident
will
in
due
course
be
laid
before
you
and
will
disclose
the
unpardonable
conduct
of
the
official
referred
to
in
his
interference
by
advice
and
counsel
with
the
suffrages
of
american
citizens
in
the
very
crisis
of
the
presidential
election
then
near
at
hand
and
also
in
his
subsequent
public
declarations
to
justify
his
action
superadding
impugnment
of
the
executive
and
senate
of
the
united
states
in
connection
with
important
questions
now
pending
in
controversy
between
the
two
governments
the
offense
thus
committed
was
most
grave
involving
disastrous
possibilities
to
the
good
relations
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain
constituting
a
gross
breach
of
diplomatic
privilege
and
an
invasion
of
the
purely
domestic
affairs
and
essential
sovereignty
of
the
government
to
which
the
envoy
was
accredited
having
first
fulfilled
the
just
demands
of
international
comity
by
affording
full
opportunity
for
her
majestys
government
to
act
in
relief
of
the
situation
i
considered
prolongation
of
discussion
to
be
unwarranted
and
thereupon
declined
to
further
recognize
the
diplomatic
character
of
the
person
whose
continuance
in
such
function
would
destroy
that
mutual
confidence
which
is
essential
to
the
good
understanding
of
the
two
governments
and
was
inconsistent
with
the
welfare
and
selfrespect
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
usual
interchange
of
communication
has
since
continued
through
her
majestys
legation
in
this
city
my
endeavors
to
establish
by
international
cooperation
measures
for
the
prevention
of
the
extermination
of
fur
seals
in
bering
sea
have
not
been
relaxed
and
i
have
hopes
of
being
enabled
shortly
to
submit
an
effective
and
satisfactory
conventional
projet
with
the
maritime
powers
for
the
approval
of
the
senate
the
coastal
boundary
between
our
alaskan
possessions
and
british
columbia
i
regret
to
say
has
not
received
the
attention
demanded
by
its
importance
and
which
on
several
occasions
heretofore
i
have
had
the
honor
to
recommend
to
the
congress
the
admitted
impracticability
if
not
impossibility
of
making
an
accurate
and
precise
survey
and
demarcation
of
the
boundary
line
as
it
is
recited
in
the
treaty
with
russia
under
which
alaska
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
renders
it
absolutely
requisite
for
the
prevention
of
international
jurisdictional
complications
that
adequate
appropriation
for
a
reconnoissance
and
survey
to
obtain
proper
knowledge
of
the
locality
and
the
geographical
features
of
the
boundary
should
be
authorized
by
congress
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
knowledge
to
be
only
thus
obtained
is
an
essential
prerequisite
for
negotiation
for
ascertaining
a
common
boundary
or
as
preliminary
to
any
other
mode
of
settlement
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
some
agreement
should
be
reached
with
her
majestys
government
by
which
the
damages
to
life
and
property
on
the
great
lakes
may
be
alleviated
by
removing
or
humanely
regulating
the
obstacles
to
reciprocal
assistance
to
wrecked
or
stranded
vessels
the
act
of
june
which
offers
to
canadian
vessels
free
access
to
our
inland
waters
in
aid
of
wrecked
or
disabled
vessels
has
not
yet
become
effective
through
concurrent
action
by
canada
the
due
protection
of
our
citizens
of
french
origin
or
descent
from
claim
of
military
service
in
the
event
of
their
returning
to
or
visiting
france
has
called
forth
correspondence
which
was
laid
before
you
at
the
last
session
in
the
absence
of
conventional
agreement
as
to
naturalization
which
is
greatly
to
be
desired
this
government
sees
no
occasion
to
recede
from
the
sound
position
it
has
maintained
not
only
with
regard
to
france
but
as
to
all
countries
with
which
the
united
states
have
not
concluded
special
treaties
twice
within
the
last
year
has
the
imperial
household
of
germany
been
visited
by
death
and
i
have
hastened
to
express
the
sorrow
of
this
people
and
their
appreciation
of
the
lofty
character
of
the
late
aged
emperor
william
and
their
sympathy
with
the
heroism
under
suffering
of
his
son
the
late
emperor
frederick
i
renew
my
recommendation
of
two
years
ago
for
the
passage
of
a
bill
for
the
refunding
to
certain
german
steamship
lines
of
the
interest
upon
tonnage
dues
illegally
exacted
on
the
th
d
of
april
last
i
laid
before
the
house
of
representatives
full
information
respecting
our
interests
in
samoa
and
in
the
subsequent
correspondence
on
the
same
subject
which
will
be
laid
before
you
in
due
course
the
history
of
events
in
those
islands
will
be
found
in
a
message
accompanying
my
approval
on
the
st
day
of
october
last
of
a
bill
for
the
exclusion
of
chinese
laborers
i
laid
before
congress
full
information
and
all
correspondence
touching
the
negotiation
of
the
treaty
with
china
concluded
at
this
capital
on
the
th
day
of
march
and
which
having
been
confirmed
by
the
senate
with
certain
amendments
was
rejected
by
the
chinese
government
this
message
contained
a
recommendation
that
a
sum
of
money
be
appropriated
as
compensation
to
chinese
subjects
who
had
suffered
injuries
at
the
hands
of
lawless
men
within
our
jurisdiction
such
appropriation
having
been
duly
made
the
fund
awaits
reception
by
the
chinese
government
it
is
sincerely
hoped
that
by
the
cessation
of
the
influx
of
this
class
of
chinese
subjects
in
accordance
with
the
expressed
wish
of
both
governments
a
cause
of
unkind
feeling
has
been
permanently
removed
on
the
th
of
august
notification
was
given
by
the
japanese
minister
at
this
capital
of
the
adjournment
of
the
conference
for
the
revision
of
the
treaties
of
japan
with
foreign
powers
owing
to
the
objection
of
his
government
to
the
provision
in
the
draft
jurisdictional
convention
which
required
the
submission
of
the
criminal
code
of
the
empire
to
the
powers
in
advance
of
its
becoming
operative
this
notification
was
however
accompanied
with
an
assurance
of
japans
intention
to
continue
the
work
of
revision
notwithstanding
this
temporary
interruption
of
negotiations
it
is
hoped
that
improvements
may
soon
be
secured
in
the
jurisdictional
system
as
respects
foreigners
in
japan
and
relief
afforded
to
that
country
from
the
present
undue
and
oppressive
foreign
control
in
matters
of
commerce
i
earnestly
recommend
that
relief
be
provided
for
the
injuries
accidentally
caused
to
japanese
subjects
in
the
island
ikisima
by
the
target
practice
of
one
of
our
vessels
a
diplomatic
mission
from
korea
has
been
received
and
the
formal
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
contemplated
by
the
treaty
of
is
now
established
legislative
provision
is
hereby
recommended
to
organize
and
equip
consular
courts
in
korea
persia
has
established
diplomatic
representation
at
this
capital
and
has
evinced
very
great
interest
in
the
enterprise
and
achievements
of
our
citizens
i
am
therefore
hopeful
that
beneficial
commercial
relations
between
the
two
countries
may
be
brought
about
i
announce
with
sincere
regret
that
hayti
has
again
become
the
theater
of
insurrection
disorder
and
bloodshed
the
titular
government
of
president
saloman
has
been
forcibly
overthrown
and
he
driven
out
of
the
country
to
france
where
he
has
since
died
the
tenure
of
power
has
been
so
unstable
amid
the
war
of
factions
that
has
ensued
since
the
expulsion
of
president
saloman
that
no
government
constituted
by
the
will
of
the
haytian
people
has
been
recognized
as
administering
responsibly
the
affairs
of
that
country
our
representative
has
been
instructed
to
abstain
from
interference
between
the
warring
factions
and
a
vessel

of
our
navy
has
been
sent
to
haytian
waters
to
sustain
our
minister
and
for
the
protection
of
the
persons
and
property
of
american
citizens
due
precautions
have
been
taken
to
enforce
our
neutrality
laws
and
prevent
our
territory
from
becoming
the
base
of
military
supplies
for
either
of
the
warring
factions
under
color
of
a
blockade
of
which
no
reasonable
notice
had
been
given
and
which
does
not
appear
to
have
been
efficiently
maintained
a
seizure
of
vessels
under
the
american
flag
has
been
reported
and
in
consequence
measures
to
prevent
and
redress
any
molestation
of
our
innocent
merchantmen
have
been
adopted
proclamation
was
duly
made
on
the
th
day
of
november
of
the
conventional
extensions
of
the
treaty
of
june
with
hawaii
under
which
relations
of
such
special
and
beneficent
intercourse
have
been
created
in
the
vast
field
of
oriental
commerce
now
unfolded
from
our
pacific
borders
no
feature
presents
stronger
recommendations
for
congressional
action
than
the
establishment
of
communication
by
submarine
telegraph
with
honolulu
the
geographical
position
of
the
hawaiian
group
in
relation
to
our
pacific
states
creates
a
natural
interdependency
and
mutuality
of
interest
which
our
present
treaties
were
intended
to
foster
and
which
make
close
communication
a
logical
and
commercial
necessity
the
wisdom
of
concluding
a
treaty
of
commercial
reciprocity
with
mexico
has
been
heretofore
stated
in
my
messages
to
congress
and
the
lapse
of
time
and
growth
of
commerce
with
that
close
neighbor
and
sister
republic
confirm
the
judgment
so
expressed
the
precise
relocation
of
our
boundary
line
is
needful
and
adequate
appropriation
is
now
recommended
it
is
with
sincere
satisfaction
that
i
am
enabled
to
advert
to
the
spirit
of
good
neighborhood
and
friendly
cooperation
and
conciliation
that
has
marked
the
correspondence
and
action
of
the
mexican
authorities
in
their
share
of
the
task
of
maintaining
law
and
order
about
the
line
of
our
common
boundary
the
longpending
boundary
dispute
between
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
was
referred
to
my
arbitration
and
by
an
award
made
on
the
d
of
march
last
the
question
has
been
finally
settled
to
the
expressed
satisfaction
of
both
of
the
parties
in
interest
the
empire
of
brazil
in
abolishing
the
last
vestige
of
slavery
among
christian
nations
called
forth
the
earnest
congratulations
of
this
government
in
expression
of
the
cordial
sympathies
of
our
people
the
claims
of
nearly
all
other
countries
against
chile
growing
out
of
her
late
war
with
bolivia
and
peru
have
been
disposed
of
either
by
arbitration
or
by
a
lump
settlement
similar
claims
of
our
citizens
will
continue
to
be
urged
upon
the
chilean
government
and
it
is
hoped
will
not
be
subject
to
further
delays
a
comprehensive
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
with
peru
was
proclaimed
on
november
last
and
it
is
expected
that
under
its
operation
mutual
prosperity
and
good
understanding
will
be
promoted
in
pursuance
of
the
policy
of
arbitration
a
treaty
to
settle
the
claim
of
santos
an
american
citizen
against
ecuador
has
been
concluded
under
my
authority
and
will
be
duly
submitted
for
the
approval
of
the
senate
like
disposition
of
the
claim
of
carlos
butterfield
against
denmark
and
of
van
bokkelen
against
hayti
will
probably
be
made
and
i
trust
the
principle
of
such
settlements
may
be
extended
in
practice
under
the
approval
of
the
senate
through
unforeseen
causes
foreign
to
the
will
of
both
governments
the
ratification
of
the
convention
of
december
with
venezuela
for
the
rehearing
of
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
under
the
treaty
of
failed
of
exchange
within
the
term
provided
and
a
supplementary
convention
further
extending
the
time
for
exchange
of
ratifications
and
explanatory
of
an
ambiguous
provision
of
the
prior
convention
now
awaits
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
although
this
matter
in
the
stage
referred
to
concerns
only
the
concurrent
treatymaking
power
of
one
branch
of
congress
i
advert
to
it
in
view
of
the
interest
repeatedly
and
conspicuously
shown
by
you
in
your
legislative
capacity
in
favor
of
a
speedy
and
equitable
adjustment
of
the
questions
growing
out
of
the
discredited
judgments
of
the
previous
mixed
commission
of
caracas
with
every
desire
to
do
justice
to
the
representations
of
venezuela
in
this
regard
the
time
seems
to
have
come
to
end
this
matter
and
i
trust
the
prompt
confirmation
by
both
parties
of
the
supplementary
action
referred
to
will
avert
the
need
of
legislative
or
other
action
to
prevent
the
longer
withholding
of
such
rights
of
actual
claimants
as
may
be
shown
to
exist
as
authorized
by
the
congress
preliminary
steps
have
been
taken
for
the
assemblage
at
this
capital
during
the
coming
year
of
the
representatives
of
south
and
central
american
states
together
with
those
of
mexico
hayti
and
san
domingo
to
discuss
sundry
important
monetary
and
commercial
topics
excepting
in
those
cases
where
from
reasons
of
contiguity
of
territory
and
the
existence
of
a
common
border
line
incapable
of
being
guarded
reciprocal
commercial
treaties
may
be
found
expedient
it
is
believed
that
commercial
policies
inducing
freer
mutual
exchange
of
products
can
be
most
advantageously
arranged
by
independent
but
cooperative
legislation
in
the
mode
last
mentioned
the
control
of
our
taxation
for
revenue
will
be
always
retained
in
our
own
hands
unrestricted
by
conventional
agreements
with
other
governments
in
conformity
also
with
congressional
authority
the
maritime
powers
have
been
invited
to
confer
in
washington
in
april
next
upon
the
practicability
of
devising
uniform
rules
and
measures
for
the
greater
security
of
life
and
property
at
sea
a
disposition
to
accept
on
the
part
of
a
number
of
the
powers
has
already
been
manifested
and
if
the
cooperation
of
the
nations
chiefly
interested
shall
be
secured
important
results
may
be
confidently
anticipated
the
act
of
june
and
the
acts
amendatory
thereof
in
relation
to
tonnage
duties
have
given
rise
to
extended
correspondence
with
foreign
nations
with
whom
we
have
existing
treaties
of
navigation
and
commerce
and
have
caused
wide
and
regrettable
divergence
of
opinion
in
relation
to
the
imposition
of
the
duties
referred
to
these
questions
are
important
and
i
shall
make
them
the
subject
of
a
special
and
more
detailed
communication
at
the
present
session
with
the
rapid
increase
of
immigration
to
our
shores
and
the
facilities
of
modern
travel
abuses
of
the
generous
privileges
afforded
by
our
naturalization
laws
call
for
their
careful
revision
the
easy
and
unguarded
manner
in
which
certificates
of
american
citizenship
can
now
be
obtained
has
induced
a
class
unfortunately
large
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
become
absolved
from
allegiance
to
their
native
land
and
yet
by
a
foreign
residence
to
escape
any
just
duty
and
contribution
of
service
to
the
country
of
their
proposed
adoption
thus
while
evading
the
duties
of
citizenship
to
the
united
states
they
may
make
prompt
claim
for
its
national
protection
and
demand
its
intervention
in
their
behalf
international
complications
of
a
serious
nature
arise
and
the
correspondence
of
the
state
department
discloses
the
great
number
and
complexity
of
the
questions
which
have
been
raised
our
laws
regulating
the
issue
of
passports
should
be
carefully
revised
and
the
institution
of
a
central
bureau
of
registration
at
the
capital
is
again
strongly
recommended
by
this
means
full
particulars
of
each
case
of
naturalization
in
the
united
states
would
be
secured
and
properly
indexed
and
recorded
and
thus
many
cases
of
spurious
citizenship
would
be
detected
and
unjust
responsibilities
would
be
avoided
the
reorganization
of
the
consular
service
is
a
matter
of
serious
importance
to
our
national
interests
the
number
of
existing
principal
consular
offices
is
believed
to
be
greater
than
is
at
all
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
the
public
business
it
need
not
be
our
policy
to
maintain
more
than
a
moderate
number
of
principal
offices
each
supported
by
a
salary
sufficient
to
enable
the
incumbent
to
live
in
comfort
and
so
distributed
as
to
secure
the
convenient
supervision
through
subordinate
agencies
of
affairs
over
a
considerable
district
i
repeat
the
recommendations
heretofore
made
by
me
that
the
appropriations
for
the
maintenance
of
our
diplomatic
and
consular
service
should
be
recast
that
the
socalled
notarial
or
unofficial
fees
which
our
representatives
abroad
are
now
permitted
to
treat
as
personal
perquisites
should
be
forbidden
that
a
system
of
consular
inspection
should
be
instituted
and
that
a
limited
number
of
secretaries
of
legation
at
large
should
be
authorized
preparations
for
the
centennial
celebration
on
april
of
the
inauguration
of
george
washington
as
president
of
the
united
states
at
the
city
of
new
york
have
been
made
by
a
voluntary
organization
of
the
citizens
of
that
locality
and
believing
that
an
opportunity
should
be
afforded
for
the
expression
of
the
interest
felt
throughout
the
country
in
this
event
i
respectfully
recommend
fitting
and
cooperative
action
by
congress
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
exhibits
in
detail
the
condition
of
our
national
finances
and
the
operations
of
the
several
branches
of
the
government
related
to
his
department
the
total
ordinary
revenues
of
the
government
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
amounted
to
of
which
was
received
from
customs
duties
and
from
internal
revenue
taxes
the
total
receipts
from
all
sources
exceeded
those
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
by
the
ordinary
expenditures
of
the
government
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
were
leaving
a
surplus
of
the
decrease
in
these
expenditures
as
compared
with

was
notwithstanding
the
payment
of
more
than
for
pensions
in
excess
of
what
was
paid
for
that
purpose
in
the
lattermentioned
year
the
revenues
of
the
government
for
the
year
ending
june
ascertained
for
the
quarter
ended
september
and
estimated
for
the
remainder
of
the
time
amount
to

the
actual
and
estimated
ordinary
expenditures
for
the
sa
me
year
are
leaving
an
estimated
surplus
of
the
estimated
receipts
for
the
year
ending
june
are
and
the
estimated
ordinary
expenditures
for
the
same
time
are
showing
a
surplus
of
the
foregoing
statements
of
surplus
do
not
take
into
account
the
sum
necessary
to
be
expended
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
sinkingfund
act
amounting
to
more
than
annually
the
cost
of
collecting
the
customs
revenues
for
the
last
fiscal
year
was
per

for
the
year
it
was
per
cent
the
excess
of
internalrevenue
taxes
collected
during
the
last
fiscal
year
over
those
collected
for
the
year
ended
june
was
and
the
cost
of
collecting
this
revenue
decreased
from
per
cent
in
to
less
than
per
cent
for
the
last
year
the
tax
collected
on
oleomargarine
was
for

ending

and
for
the
following
year
the
requirements
of
the
sinkingfund
act
have
been
met
for
the
year
ended
june
and
for
the
current
year
also
by
the
purchase
of
bonds
after
complying
with
this
law
as
positively
required
and
bonds
sufficient
for
that
purpose
had
been
bought
at
a
premium
it
was
not
deemed
prudent
to
further
expend
the
surplus
in
such
purchases
until
the
authority
to
do
so
should
be
more
explicit
a
resolution
however
having
been
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress
removing
all
doubt
as
to
executive
authority
daily
purchases
of
bonds
were
commenced
on
the
d
day
of
april
and
have
continued
until
the
present
time
by
this
plan
bonds
of
the
government
not
yet
due
have
been
purchased
up
to
and
including
the
th
day
of
november
amounting
to
the
premium
paid
thereon
amounting
to
the
premium
added
to
the
principal
of
these
bonds
represents
an
investment
yielding
about
per
cent
interest
for
the
time
they
still
had
to
run
and
the
saving
to
the
government
represented
by
the
difference
between
the
amount
of
interest
at
per
cent
upon
the
sum
paid
for
principal
and
premium
and
what
it
would
have
paid
for
interest
at
the
rate
specified
in
the
bonds
if
they
had
run
to
their
maturity
is
about
at
first
sight
this
would
seem
to
be
a
profitable
and
sensible
transaction
on
the
part
of
the
government
but
as
suggested
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
surplus
thus
expended
for
the
purchase
of
bonds
was
money
drawn
from
the
people
in
excess
of
any
actual
need
of
the
government
and
was
so
expended
rather
than
allow
it
to
remain
idle
in
the
treasury
if
this
surplus
under
the
operation
of
just
and
equitable
laws
had
been
left
in
the
hands
of
the
people
it
would
have
been
worth
in
their
business
at
least
per
cent
per
annum
deducting
from
the
amount
of
interest
upon
the
principal
and
premium
of
these
bonds
for
the
time
they
had
to
run
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
the
saving
of
per
cent
made
for
the
people
by
the
purchase
of
such
bonds
the
loss
will
appear
to
be
this
calculation
would
seem
to
demonstrate
that
if
excessive
and
unnecessary
taxation
is
continued
and
the
government
is
forced
to
pursue
this
policy
of
purchasing
its
own
bonds
at
the
premiums
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
pay
the
loss
to
the
people
will
be
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
since
the
purchase
of
bonds
was
undertaken
as
mentioned
nearly
all
that
have
been
offered
were
at
last
accepted
it
has
been
made
quite
apparent
that
the
government
was
in
danger
of
being
subjected
to
combinations
to
raise
their
price
as
appears
by
the
instance
cited
by
the
secretary
of
the
offering
of
bonds
of
the
par
value
of
only
so
often
that
the
aggregate
of
the
sums
demanded
for
their
purchase
amounted
to
more
than
notwithstanding
the
large
sums
paid
out
in
the
purchase
of
bonds
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
on
the
th
day
of
november
was
after
deducting
about
just
drawn
out
for
the
payment
of
pensions
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
there
had
been
coined
under
the
compulsory
silvercoinage
act
in
silver
dollars
of
which
were
in
the
hands
of
the
people
on
the
th
day
of
june
there
had
been
coined
and
of
this
was
in
circulation
in
coin
and
in
silver
certificates
for
the
redemption
of
which
silver
dollars
to
that
amount
were
held
by
the
government
on
the
th
day
of
november
had
been
coined
of
the
silver
dollars
were
actually
in
circulation
and
in
certificates
the
secretary
recommends
the
suspension
of
the
further
coinage
of
silver
and
in
such
recommendation
i
earnestly
concur
for
further
valuable
information
and
timely
recommendations
i
ask
the
careful
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
secretarys
report
the
secretary
of
war
reports
that
the
army
at
the
date
of
the
last
consolidated
returns
consisted
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
the
actual
expenditures
of
the
war
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
amounted
to
of
which
sum
was
expended
for
public
works
including
river
and
harbor
improvements
the
board
of
ordnance
and
fortifications
provided
for
under
the
act
approved
september

was
convened
october
and

and
also
for
procuring
inch
breechloading
mortars
cast
iron
hooped
with
steel
under
the
provisions
of
section
of
the
said
act
were
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
war
for
reference
to
the
board
by
the
ordnance
department
on
the
same
date
these
plans
and
specifications
having
been
promptly
approved
by
the
board
and
the
secretary
of
war
the
necessary
authority
to
publish
advertisements
inviting
proposals
in
the
newspapers
throughout
the
country
was
granted
by
the
secretary
on
november
and
on
november
the
advertisements
were
sent
out
to
the
different
newspapers
designated
the
bids
for
the
steel
forgings
are
to
be
opened
on
december
and
for
the
mortars
on
december
a
board
of
ordnance
officers
was
convened
at
the
watervliet
arsenal
on
october
to
prepare
the
necessary
plans
and
specifications
for
the
establishment
of
an
army
gun
factory
at
that
point
the
preliminary
report
of
this
board
with
estimates
for
shop
buildings
and
officers
quarters
was
approved
by
the
board
of
ordnance
and
fortifications
november
and
the
specifications
and
form
of
advertisement
and
instructions
to
bidders
have
been
prepared
and
advertisements
inviting
proposals
for
the
excavations
for
the
shop
building
and
for
erecting
the
two
sets
of
officers
quarters
have
been
published
the
detailed
drawings
and
specifications
for
the
gunfactory
building
are
well
in
hand
and
will
be
finished
within
three
or
four
months
when
bids
will
be
invited
for
the
erection
of
the
building
the
list
of
machines
etc
is
made
out
and
it
is
expected
that
the
plans
for
the
large
lathes
etc
will
be
completed
within
about
four
months
and
after
approval
by
the
board
of
ordnance
and
fortifications
bids
for
furnishing
the
same
will
be
invited
the
machines
and
other
fixtures
will
be
completed
as
soon
as
the
shop
is
in
readiness
to
receive
them
probably
about
july
under
the
provisions
of
the
army
bill
for
the
procurement
of
pneumatic
dynamite
guns
the
necessary
specifications
are
now
being
prepared
and
advertisements
for
proposals
will
issue
early
in
december
the
guns
will
probably
be
of
inches
caliber
and
fire
a
projectile
that
will
carry
a
charge
each
of
about
pounds
of
explosive
gelatine
with
fullcaliber
projectiles
the
guns
will
probably
be
delivered
in
from
six
to
ten
months
from
the
date
of
the
contract
so
that
all
the
guns
of
this
class
that
can
be
procured
under
the
provisions
of
the
law
will
be
purchased
during
the
year
i
earnestly
request
that
the
recommendations
contained
in
the
secretarys
report
all
of
which
are
in
my
opinion
calculated
to
increase
the
usefulness
and
discipline
of
the
army
may
receive
the
consideration
of
the
congress
among
these
the
proposal
that
there
should
be
provided
a
plan
for
the
examination
of
officers
to
test
their
fitness
for
promotion
is
of
the
utmost
importance
this
reform
has
been
before
recommended
in
the
reports
of
the
secretary
and
its
expediency
is
so
fully
demonstrated
by
the
argument
he
presents
in
its
favor
that
its
adoption
should
no
longer
be
neglected
the
death
of
general
sheridan
in
august
last
was
a
national
affliction
the
army
then
lost
the
grandest
of
its
chiefs
the
country
lost
a
brave
and
experienced
soldier
a
wise
and
discreet
counselor
and
a
modest
and
sensible
man
those
who
in
any
manner
came
within
the
range
of
his
personal
association
will
never
fail
to
pay
deserved
and
willing
homage
to
his
greatness
and
the
glory
of
his
career
but
they
will
cherish
with
more
tender
sensibility
the
loving
memory
of
his
simple
generous
and
considerate
nature
the
apache
indians
whose
removal
from
their
reservation
in
arizona
followed
the
capture
of
those
of
their
number
who
engaged
in
a
bloody
and
murderous
raid
during
a
part
of
the
years
and
are
now
held
as
prisoners
of
war
at
mount
vernon
barracks
in
the
state
of
alabama
they
numbered
on
the
st
day
of
october
the
date
of
the
last
report
men
women
boys
and
girls
in
all
persons
the
commanding
officer
states
that
they
are
in
good
health
and
contented
and
that
they
are
kept
employed
as
fully
as
is
possible
in
the
circumstances
the
children
as
they
arrive
at
a
suitable
age
are
sent
to
the
indian
schools
at
carlisle
and
hampton
last
summer
some
charitable
and
kind
people
asked
permission
to
send
two
teachers
to
these
indians
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
adults
as
well
as
such
children
as
should
be
found
there
such
permission
was
readily
granted
accommodations
were
provided
for
the
teachers
and
some
portions
of
the
buildings
at
the
barracks
were
made
available
for
school
purposes
the
good
work
contemplated
has
been
commenced
and
the
teachers
engaged
are
paid
by
the
ladies
with
whom
the
plan
originated
i
am
not
at
all
in
sympathy
with
those
benevolent
but
injudicious
people
who
are
constantly
insisting
that
these
indians
should
be
returned
to
their
reservation
their
removal
was
an
absolute
necessity
if
the
lives
and
property
of
citizens
upon
the
frontier
are
to
be
at
all
regarded
by
the
government
their
continued
restraint
at
a
distance
from
the
scene
of
their
repeated
and
cruel
murders
and
outrages
is
still
necessary
it
is
a
mistaken
philanthropy
every
way
injurious
which
prompts
the
desire
to
see
these
savages
returned

to
their
old
haunts
they
are
in
their
present
location
as
the
result
of
the
best
judgment
of
those
having
official
responsibility
in
the
matter
and
who
are
by
no
means
lacking
in
kind
consideration
for
the
indians
a
number
of
these
prisoners
have
forfeited
their
lives
to
outraged
law
and
humanity
experience
has
proved
that
they
are
dangerous
and
can
not
be
trusted
this
is
true
not
only
of
those
who
on
the
warpath
have
heretofore
actually
been
guilty
of
atrocious
murder
but
of
their
kindred
and
friends
who
while
they
remained
upon
their
reservation
furnished
aid
and
comfort
to
those
absent
with
bloody
intent
these
prisoners
should
be
treated
kindly
and
kept
in
restraint
far
from
the
locality
of
their
former
reservation
they
should
be
subjected
to
efforts
calculated
to
lead
to
their
improvement
and
the
softening
of
their
savage
and
cruel
instincts
but
their
return
to
their
old
home
should
be
persistently
resisted
the
secretary
in
his
report
gives
a
graphic
history
of
these
indians
and
recites
with
painful
vividness
their
bloody
deeds
and
the
unhappy
failure
of
the
government
to
manage
them
by
peaceful
means
it
will
be
amazing
if
a
perusal
of
this
history
will
allow
the
survival
of
a
desire
for
the
return
of
these
prisoners
to
their
reservation
upon
sentimental
or
any
other
grounds
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
demonstrates
very
intelligent
management
in
that
important
department
and
discloses
the
most
satisfactory
progress
in
the
work
of
reconstructing
the
navy
made
during
the
past
year
of
the
ships
in
course
of
construction
five
viz
the
charleston
baltimore
yorktown
vesuvius
and
the
petrel
have
in
that
time
been
launched
and
are
rapidly
approaching
completion
and
in
addition
to
the
above
the
philadelphia
the
san
francisco
the
newark
the
bennington
the
concord
and
the
herreshoff
torpedo
boat
are
all
under
contract
for
delivery
to
the
department
during
the
next
year
the
progress
already
made
and
being
made
gives
good
ground
for
the
expectation
that
these
eleven
vessels
will
be
incorporated
as
part
of
the
american
navy
within
the
next
twelve
months
the
report
shows
that
notwithstanding
the
large
expenditures
for
new
construction
and
the
additional
labor
they
involve
the
total
ordinary
or
current
expenditures
of
the
department
for
the
three
years
ending
june
are
less
by
more
than
per
cent
than
such
expenditures
for
the
three
years
ending
june
the
various
steps
which
have
been
taken
to
improve
the
business
methods
of
the
department
are
reviewed
by
the
secretary
the
purchasing
of
supplies
has
been
consolidated
and
placed
under
a
responsible
bureau
head
this
has
resulted
in
the
curtailment
of
open
purchases
which
in
the
years
and
amounted
to
over
per
cent
of
all
the
purchases
of
the
department
to
less
than
per
cent
so
that
at
the
present
time
about
per
cent
of
the
total
departmental
purchases
are
made
by
contract
and
after
competition
as
the
expenditures
on
this
account
exceed
an
average
of
annually
it
is
evident
that
an
important
improvement
in
the
system
has
been
inaugurated
and
substantial
economies
introduced
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
shows
a
marked
increase
of
business
in
every
branch
of
the
postal
service
the
number
of
postoffices
on
july
was
an
increase
of
in
three
years
and
of
for
the
last
fiscal
year
the
lattermentioned
increase
is
classified
as
follows
new
england
states
middle
states
southern
states
and
indian
territory
the
states
and
territories
of
the
pacific
coast
the
ten
states
and

of
the
west
and
northwest
district
of
columbia

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
you
are
confronted
at
the
threshold
of
your
legislative
duties
with
a
condition
of
the
national
finances
which
imperatively
demands
immediate
and
careful
consideration
the
amount
of
money
annually
exacted
through
the
operation
of
present
laws
from
the
industries
and
necessities
of
the
people
largely
exceeds
the
sum
necessary
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
government
when
we
consider
that
the
theory
of
our
institutions
guarantees
to
every
citizen
the
full
enjoyment
of
all
the
fruits
of
his
industry
and
enterprise
with
only
such
deduction
as
may
be
his
share
toward
the
careful
and
economical
maintenance
of
the
government
which
protects
him
it
is
plain
that
the
exaction
of
more
than
this
is
indefensible
extortion
and
a
culpable
betrayal
of
american
fairness
and
justice
this
wrong
inflicted
upon
those
who
bear
the
burden
of
national
taxation
like
other
wrongs
multiplies
a
brood
of
evil
consequences
the
public
treasury
which
should
only
exist
as
a
conduit
conveying
the
peoples
tribute
to
its
legitimate
objects
of
expenditure
becomes
a
hoarding
place
for
money
needlessly
withdrawn
from
trade
and
the
peoples
use
thus
crippling
our
national
energies
suspending
our
countrys
development
preventing
investment
in
productive
enterprise
threatening
financial
disturbance
and
inviting
schemes
of
public
plunder
this
condition
of
our
treasury
is
not
altogether
new
and
it
has
more
than
once
of
late
been
submitted
to
the
peoples
representatives
in
the
congress
who
alone
can
apply
a
remedy
and
yet
the
situation
still
continues
with
aggravated
incidents
more
than
ever
presaging
financial
convulsion
and
widespread
disaster
it
will
not
do
to
neglect
this
situation
because
its
dangers
are
not
now
palpably
imminent
and
apparent
they
exist
none
the
less
certainly
and
await
the
unforeseen
and
unexpected
occasion
when
suddenly
they
will
be
precipitated
upon
us
on
the
th
day
of
june
the
excess
of
revenues
over
public
expenditures
after
complying
with
the
annual
requirement
of
the
sinkingfund
act
was
during
the
year
ended
june
such
excess
amounted
to
and
during
the
year
ended
june
it
reached
the
sum
of
the
annual
contributions
to
the
sinking
fund
during
the
three
years
above
specified
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
and
deducted
from
the
surplus
as
stated
were
made
by
calling
in
for
that
purpose
outstanding
per
cent
bonds
of
the
government
during
the
six
months
prior
to
june
the
surplus
revenue
had
grown
so
large
by
repeated
accumulations
and
it
was
feared
the
withdrawal
of
this
great
sum
of
money
needed
by
the
people
would
so
affect
the
business
of
the
country
that
the
sum
of
of
such
surplus
was
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
per
cent
bonds
still
outstanding
and
which
were
then
payable
at
the
option
of
the
government
the
precarious
condition
of
financial
affairs
among
the
people
still
needing
relief
immediately
after
the
th
day
of
june
the
remainder
of
the
per
cent
bonds
then
outstanding
amounting
with
principal
and
interest
to
the
sum
of
were
called
in
and
applied
to
the
sinkingfund
contribution
for
the
current
fiscal
year
notwithstanding
these
operations
of
the
treasury
department
representations
of
distress
in
business
circles
not
only
continued
but
increased
and
absolute
peril
seemed
at
hand
in
these
circumstances
the
contribution
to
the
sinking
fund
for
the
current
fiscal
year
was
at
once
completed
by
the
expenditure
of
in
the
purchase
of
government
bonds
not
yet
due
bearing
and
per
cent
interest
the
premium
paid
thereon
averaging
about
per
cent
for
the
former
and
per
cent
for
the
latter
in
addition
to
this
the
interest
accruing
during
the
current
year
upon
the
outstanding
bonded
indebtedness
of
the
government
was
to
some
extent
anticipated
and
banks
selected
as
depositories
of
public
money
were
permitted
to
somewhat
increase
their
deposits
while
the
expedients
thus
employed
to
release
to
the
people
the
money
lying
idle
in
the
treasury
served
to
avert
immediate
danger
our
surplus
revenues
have
continued
to
accumulate
the
excess
for
the
present
year
amounting
on
the
st
day
of
december
to
and
estimated
to
reach
the
sum
of
on
the
th
of
june
next
at
which
date
it
is
expected
that
this
sum
added
to
prior
accumulations
will
swell
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
to
there
seems
to
be
no
assurance
that
with
such
a
withdrawal
from
use
of
the
peoples
circulating
medium
our
business
community
may
not
in
the
near
future
be
subjected
to
the
same
distress
which
was
quite
lately
produced
from
the
same
cause
and
while
the
functions
of
our
national
treasury
should
be
few
and
simple
and
while
its
best
condition
would
be
reached
i
believe
by
its
entire
disconnection
with
private
business
interests
yet
when
by
a
perversion
of
its
purposes
it
idly
holds
money
uselessly
subtracted
from
the
channels
of
trade
there
seems
to
be
reason
for
the
claim
that
some
legitimate
means
should
be
devised
by
the
government
to
restore
in
an
emergency
without
waste
or
extravagance
such
money
to
its
place
among
the
people
if
such
an
emergency
arises
there
now
exists
no
clear
and
undoubted
executive
power
of
relief
heretofore
the
redemption
of
per
cent
bonds
which
were
payable
at
the
option
of
the
government
has
afforded
a
means
for
the
disbursement
of
the
excess
of
our
revenues
but
these
bonds
have
all
been
retired
and
there
are
no
bonds
outstanding
the
payment
of
which
we
have
a
right
to
insist
upon
the
contribution
to
the
sinking
fund
which
furnishes
the
occasion
for
expenditure
in
the
purchase
of
bonds
has
been
already
made
for
the
current
year
so
that
there
is
no
outlet
in
that
direction
in
the
present
state
of
legislation
the
only
pretense
of
any
existing
executive
power
to
restore
at
this
time
any
part
of
our
surplus
revenues
to
the
people
by
its
expenditure
consists
in
the
supposition
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
may
enter
the
market
and
purchase
the
bonds
of
the
government
not
yet
due
at
a
rate
of
premium
to
be
agreed
upon
the
only
provision
of
law
from
which
such
a
power
could
be
derived
is
found
in
an
appropriation
bill
passed
a
number
of
years
ago
and
it
is
subject
to
the
suspicion
that
it
was
intended
as
temporary
and
limited
in
its
application
instead
of
conferring
a
continuing
discretion
and
authority
no
condition
ought
to
exist
which
would
justify
the
grant
of
power
to
a
single
official
upon
his
judgment
of
its
necessity
to
withhold
from
or
release
to
the
business
of
the
people
in
an
unusual
manner
money
held
in
the
treasury
and
thus
affect
at
his
will
the
financial
situation
of
the
country
and
if
it
is
deemed
wise
to
lodge
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
authority
in
the
present
juncture
to
purchase
bonds
it
should
be
plainly
vested
and
provided
as
far
as
possible
with
such
checks
and
limitations
as
will
define
this
officials
right
and
discretion
and
at
the
same
time
relieve
him
from
undue
responsibility
in
considering
the
question
of
purchasing
bonds
as
a
means
of
restoring
to
circulation
the
surplus
money
accumulating
in
the
treasury
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
premiums
must
of
course
be
paid
upon
such
purchase
that
there
may
be
a
large
part
of
these
bonds
held
as
investments
which
can
not
be
purchased
at
any
price
and
that
combinations
among
holders
who
are
willing
to
sell
may
unreasonably
enhance
the
cost
of
such
bonds
to
the
government
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
present
bonded
debt
might
be
refunded
at
a
less
rate
of
interest
and
the
difference
between
the
old
and
new
security
paid
in
cash
thus
finding
use
for
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
the
success
of
this
plan
it
is
apparent
must
depend
upon
the
volition
of
the
holders
of
the
present
bonds
and
it
is
not
entirely
certain
that
the
inducement
which
must
be
offered
them
would
result
in
more
financial
benefit
to
the
government
than
the
purchase
of
bonds
while
the
latter
proposition
would
reduce
the
principal
of
the
debt
by
actual
payment
instead
of
extending
it
the
proposition
to
deposit
the
money
held
by
the
government
in
banks
throughout
the
country
for
use
by
the
people
is
it
seems
to
me
exceedingly
objectionable
in
principle
as
establishing
too
close
a
relationship
between
the
operations
of
the
government
treasury
and
the
business
of
the
country
and
too
extensive
a
commingling
of
their
money
thus
fostering
an
unnatural
reliance
in
private
business
upon
public
funds
if
this
scheme
should
be
adopted
it
should
only
be
done
as
a
temporary
expedient
to
meet
an
urgent
necessity
legislative
and
executive
effort
should
generally
be
in
the
opposite
direction
and
should
have
a
tendency
to
divorce
as
much
and
as
fast
as
can
be
safely
done
the
treasury
department
from
private
enterprise
of
course
it
is
not
expected
that
unnecessary
and
extravagant
appropriations
will
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
accumulation
of
an
excess
of
revenue
such
expenditure
besides
the
demoralization
of
all
just
conceptions
of
public
duty
which
it
entails
stimulates
a
habit
of
reckless
improvidence
not
in
the
least
consistent
with
the
mission
of
our
people
or
the
high
and
beneficent
purposes
of
our
government
i
have
deemed
it
my
duty
to
thus
bring
to
the
knowledge
of
my
countrymen
as
well
as
to
the
attention
of
their
representatives
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
legislative
relief
the
gravity
of
our
financial
situation
the
failure
of
the
congress
heretofore
to
provide
against
the
dangers
which
it
was
quite
evident
the
very
nature
of
the
difficulty
must
necessarily
produce
caused
a
condition
of
financial
distress
and
apprehension
since
your
last
adjournment
which
taxed
to
the
utmost
all
the
authority
and
expedients
within
executive
control
and
these
appear
now
to
be
exhausted
if
disaster
results
from
the
continued
inaction
of
congress
the
responsibility
must
rest
where
it
belongs
though
the
situation
thus
far
considered
is
fraught
with
danger
which
should
be
fully
realized
and
though
it
presents
features
of
wrong
to
the
people
as
well
as
peril
to
the
country
it
is
but
a
result
growing
out
of
a
perfectly
palpable
and
apparent
cause
constantly
reproduc
ing
the
same
alarming
circumstancesa
congested
national
treasury
and
a
depleted
monetary
condition
in
the
business
of
the
country
it
need
hardly
be
stated
that
while
the
present
situation
demands
a
remedy
we
can
only
be
saved
from
a
like
predicament
in
the
future
by
the
removal
of
its
cause
our
scheme
of
taxation
by
means
of
which
this
needless
surplus
is
taken
from
the
people
and
put
into
the
public
treasury
consists
of
a
tariff
or
duty
levied
upon
importations
from
abroad
and
internalrevenue
taxes
levied
upon
the
consumption
of
tobacco
and
spirituous
and
malt
liquors
it
must
be
conceded
that
none
of
the
things
subjected
to
internalrevenue
taxation
are
strictly
speaking
necessaries
there
appears
to
be
no
just
complaint
of
this
taxation
by
the
consumers
of
these
articles
and
there
seems
to
be
nothing
so
well
able
to
bear
the
burden
without
hardship
to
any
portion
of
the
people
but
our
present
tariff
laws
the
vicious
inequitable
and
illogical
source
of
unnecessary
taxation
ought
to
be
at
once
revised
and
amended
these
laws
as
their
primary
and
plain
effect
raise
the
price
to
consumers
of
all
articles
imported
and
subject
to
duty
by
precisely
the
sum
paid
for
such
duties
thus
the
amount
of
the
duty
measures
the
tax
paid
by
those
who
purchase
for
use
these
imported
articles
many
of
these
things
however
are
raised
or
manufactured
in
our
own
country
and
the
duties
now
levied
upon
foreign
goods
and
products
are
called
protection
to
these
home
manufactures
because
they
render
it
possible
for
those
of
our
people
who
are
manufacturers
to
make
these
taxed
articles
and
sell
them
for
a
price
equal
to
that
demanded
for
the
imported
goods
that
have
paid
customs
duty
so
it
happens
that
while
comparatively
a
few
use
the
imported
articles
millions
of
our
people
who
never
used
and
never
saw
any
of
the
foreign
products
purchase
and
use
things
of
the
same
kind
made
in
this
country
and
pay
therefor
nearly
or
quite
the
same
enhanced
price
which
the
duty
adds
to
the
imported
articles
those
who
buy
imports
pay
the
duty
charged
thereon
into
the
public
treasury
but
the
great
majority
of
our
citizens
who
buy
domestic
articles
of
the
same
class
pay
a
sum
at
least
approximately
equal
to
this
duty
to
the
home
manufacturer
this
reference
to
the
operation
of
our
tariff
laws
is
not
made
by
way
of
instruction
but
in
order
that
we
may
be
constantly
reminded
of
the
manner
in
which
they
impose
a
burden
upon
those
who
consume
domestic
products
as
well
as
those
who
consume
imported
articles
and
thus
create
a
tax
upon
all
our
people
it
is
not
proposed
to
entirely
relieve
the
country
of
this
taxation
it
must
be
extensively
continued
as
the
source
of
the
governments
income
and
in
a
readjustment
of
our
tariff
the
interests
of
american
labor
engaged
in
manufacture
should
be
carefully
considered
as
well
as
the
preservation
of
our
manufacturers
it
may
be
called
protection
or
by
any
other
name
but
relief
from
the
hardships
and
dangers
of
our
present
tariff
laws
should
be
devised
with
especial
precaution
against
imperiling
the
existence
of
our
manufacturing
interests
but
this
existence
should
not
mean
a
condition
which
without
regard
to
the
public
welfare
or
a
national
exigency
must
always
insure
the
realization
of
immense
profits
instead
of
moderately
profitable
returns
as
the
volume
and
diversity
of
our
national
activities
increase
new
recruits
are
added
to
those
who
desire
a
continuation
of
the
advantages
which
they
conceive
the
present
system
of
tariff
taxation
directly
affords
them
so
stubbornly
have
all
efforts
to
reform
the
present
condition
been
resisted
by
those
of
our
fellowcitizens
thus
engaged
that
they
can
hardly
complain
of
the
suspicion
entertained
to
a
certain
extent
that
there
exists
an
organized
combination
all
along
the
line
to
maintain
their
advantage
we
are
in
the
midst
of
centennial
celebrations
and
with
becoming
pride
we
rejoice
in
american
skill
and
ingenuity
in
american
energy
and
enterprise
and
in
the
wonderful
natural
advantages
and
resources
developed
by
a
centurys
national
growth
yet
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
justify
a
scheme
which
permits
a
tax
to
be
laid
upon
every
consumer
in
the
land
for
the
benefit
of
our
manufacturers
quite
beyond
a
reasonable
demand
for
governmental
regard
it
suits
the
purposes
of
advocacy
to
call
our
manufactures
infant
industries
still
needing
the
highest
and
greatest
degree
of
favor
and
fostering
care
that
can
be
wrung
from
federal
legislation
it
is
also
said
that
the
increase
in
the
price
of
domestic
manufactures
resulting
from
the
present
tariff
is
necessary
in
order
that
higher
wages
may
be
paid
to
our
workingmen
employed
in
manufactories
than
are
paid
for
what
is
called
the
pauper
labor
of
europe
all
will
acknowledge
the
force
of
an
argument
which
involves
the
welfare
and
liberal
compensation
of
our
laboring
people
our
labor
is
honorable
in
the
eyes
of
every
american
citizen
and
as
it
lies
at
the
foundation
of
our
development
and
progress
it
is
entitled
without
affectation
or
hypocrisy
to
the
utmost
regard
the
standard
of
our
laborers
life
should
not
be
measured
by
that
of
any
other
country
less
favored
and
they
are
entitled
to
their
full
share
of
all
our
advantages
by
the
last
census
it
is
made
to
appear
that
of
the
of
our
population
engaged
in
all
kinds
of
industries
are
employed
in
agriculture
in
professional
and
personal
service
of
whom
are
domestic
servants
and
laborers
while
are
employed
in
trade
and
transportation
and
are
classed
as
employed
in
manufacturing
and
mining
for
present
purposes
however
the
last
number
given
should
be
considerably
reduced
without
attempting
to
enumerate
all
it
will
be
conceded
that
there
should
be
deducted
from
those
which
it
includes
carpenters
and
joiners
milliners
dressmakers
and
seamstresses
blacksmiths
tailors
and
tailoresses
masons
butchers
bakers
plasterers
and
engaged
in
manufacturing
agricultural
implements
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
leaving
persons
employed
in
such
manufacturing
industries
as
are
claimed
to
be
benefited
by
a
high
tariff
to
these
the
appeal
is
made
to
save
their
employment
and
maintain
their
wages
by
resisting
a
change
there
should
be
no
disposition
to
answer
such
suggestions
by
the
allegation
that
they
are
in
a
minority
among
those
who
labor
and
therefore
should
forego
an
advantage
in
the
interest
of
low
prices
for
the
majority
their
compensation
as
it
may
be
affected
by
the
operation
of
tariff
laws
should
at
all
times
be
scrupulously
kept
in
view
and
yet
with
slight
reflection
they
will
not
overlook
the
fact
that
they
are
consumers
with
the
rest
that
they
too
have
their
own
wants
and
those
of
their
families
to
supply
from
their
earnings
and
that
the
price
of
the
necessaries
of
life
as
well
as
the
amount
of
their
wages
will
regulate
the
measure
of
their
welfare
and
comfort
but
the
reduction
of
taxation
demanded
should
be
so
measured
as
not
to
necessitate
or
justify
either
the
loss
of
employment
by
the
workingman
or
the
lessening
of
his
wages
and
the
profits
still
remaining
to
the
manufacturer
after
a
necessary
readjustment
should
furnish
no
excuse
for
the
sacrifice
of
the
interests
of
his
employees
either
in
their
opportunity
to
work
or
in
the
diminution
of
their
compensation
nor
can
the
worker
in
manufactures
fail
to
understand
that
while
a
high
tariff
is
claimed
to
be
necessary
to
allow
the
payment
of
remunerative
wages
it
certainly
results
in
a
very
large
increase
in
the
price
of
nearly
all
sorts
of
manufactures
which
in
almost
countless
forms
he
needs
for
the
use
of
himself
and
his
family
he
receives
at
the
desk
of
his
employer
his
wages
and
perhaps
before
he
reaches
his
home
is
obliged
in
a
purchase
for
family
use
of
an
article
which
embraces
his
own
labor
to
return
in
the
payment
of
the
increase
in
price
which
the
tariff
permits
the
hardearned
compensation
of
many
days
of
toil
the
farmer
and
the
agriculturist
who
manufacture
nothing
but
who
pay
the
increased
price
which
the
tariff
imposes
upon
every
agricultural
implement
upon
all
he
wears
and
upon
all
he
uses
and
owns
except
the
increase
of
his
flocks
and
herds
and
such
things
as
his
husbandry
produces
from
the
soil
is
invited
to
aid
in
maintaining
the
present
situation
and
he
is
told
that
a
high
duty
on
imported
wool
is
necessary
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
sheep
to
shear
in
order
that
the
price
of
their
wool
may
be
increased
they
of
course
are
not
reminded
that
the
farmer
who
has
no
sheep
is
by
this
scheme
obliged
in
his
purchases
of
clothing
and
woolen
goods
to
pay
a
tribute
to
his
fellowfarmer
as
well
as
to
the
manufacturer
and
merchant
nor
is
any
mention
made
of
the
fact
that
the
sheep
owners
themselves
and
their
households
must
wear
clothing
and
use
other
articles
manufactured
from
the
wool
they
sell
at
tariff
prices
and
thus
as
consumers
must
return
their
share
of
this
increased
price
to
the
tradesman
i
think
it
may
be
fairly
assumed
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
sheep
owned
by
the
farmers
throughout
the
country
are
found
in
small
flocks
numbering
from
twentyfive
to
fifty
the
duty
on
the
grade
of
imported
wool
which
these
sheep
yield
is
cents
each
pound
if
of
the
value
of
cents
or
less
and
cents
if
of
the
value
of
more
than
cents
if
the
liberal
estimate
of
pounds
be
allowed
for
each
fleece
the
duty
thereon
would
be
or
cents
and
this
may
be
taken
as
the
utmost
enhancement
of
its
price
to
the
farmer
by
reason
of
this
duty
eighteen
dollars
would
thus
represent
the
increased
price
of
the
wool
from
twentyfive
sheep
and
that
from
the
wool
of
fifty
sheep
and
at
present
values
this
addition
would
amount
to
about
onethird
of
its
price
if
upon
its
sale
the
farmer
receives
this
or
a
less
tariff
profit
the
wool
leaves
his
hands
charged
with
precisely
that
sum
which
in
all
its
changes
will
adhere
to
it
until
it
reaches
the
consumer
when
manufactured
into
cloth
and
other
goods
and
material
for
use
its
cost
is
not
only
increased
to
the
extent
of
the
farmers
tariff
profit
but
a
further
sum
has
been
added
for
the
benefit
of
the
manufacturer
under
the
operation
of
other
tariff
l
aws
in
the
meantime
the
day
arrives
when
the
farmer
finds
it
necessary
to
purchase
woolen
goods
and
material
to
clothe
himself
and
family
for
the
winter
when
he
faces
the
tradesman
for
that
purpose
he
discovers
that
he
is
obliged
not
only
to
return
in
the
way
of
increased
prices
his
tariff
profit
on
the
wool
he
sold
and
which
then
perhaps
lies
before
him
in
manufactured
form
but
that
he
must
add
a
considerable
sum
thereto
to
meet
a
further
increase
in
cost
caused
by
a
tariff
duty
on
the
manufacture
thus
in
the
end
he
is
aroused
to
the
fact
that
he
has
paid
upon
a
moderate
purchase
as
a
result
of
the
tariff
scheme
which
when
he
sold
his
wool
seemed
so
profitable
an
increase
in
price
more
than
sufficient
to
sweep
away
all
the
tariff
profit
he
received
upon
the
wool
he
produced
and
sold
when
the
number
of
farmers
engaged
in
wool
raising
is
compared
with
all
the
farmers
in
the
country
and
the
small
proportion
they
bear
to
our
population
is
considered
when
it
is
made
apparent
that
in
the
case
of
a
large
part
of
those
who
own
sheep
the
benefit
of
the
present
tariff
on
wool
is
illusory
and
above
all
when
it
must
be
conceded
that
the
increase
of
the
cost
of
living
caused
by
such
tariff
becomes
a
burden
upon
those
with
moderate
means
and
the
poor
the
employed
and
unemployed
the
sick
and
well
and
the
young
and
old
and
that
it
constitutes
a
tax
which
with
relentless
grasp
is
fastened
upon
the
clothing
of
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
land
reasons
are
suggested
why
the
removal
or
reduction
of
this
duty
should
be
included
in
a
revision
of
our
tariff
laws
in
speaking
of
the
increased
cost
to
the
consumer
of
our
home
manufactures
resulting
from
a
duty
laid
upon
imported
articles
of
the
same
description
the
fact
is
not
ever
looked
that
competition
among
our
domestic
producers
sometimes
has
the
effect
of
keeping
the
price
of
their
products
below
the
highest
limit
allowed
by
such
duty
but
it
is
notorious
that
this
competition
is
too
often
strangled
by
combinations
quite
prevalent
at
this
time
and
frequently
called
trusts
which
have
for
their
object
the
regulation
of
the
supply
and
price
of
commodities
made
and
sold
by
members
of
the
combination
the
people
can
hardly
hope
for
any
consideration
in
the
operation
of
these
selfish
schemes
if
however
in
the
absence
of
such
combination
a
healthy
and
free
competition
reduces
the
price
of
any
particular
dutiable
article
of
home
production
below
the
limit
which
it
might
otherwise
reach
under
our
tariff
laws
and
if
with
such
reduced
price
its
manufacture
continues
to
thrive
it
is
entirely
evident
that
one
thing
has
been
discovered
which
should
be
carefully
scrutinized
in
an
effort
to
reduce
taxation
the
necessity
of
combination
to
maintain
the
price
of
any
commodity
to
the
tariff
point
furnishes
proof
that
someone
is
willing
to
accept
lower
prices
for
such
commodity
and
that
such
prices
are
remunerative
and
lower
prices
produced
by
competition
prove
the
same
thing
thus
where
either
of
these
conditions
exists
a
case
would
seem
to
be
presented
for
an
easy
reduction
of
taxation
the
considerations
which
have
been
presented
touching
our
tariff
laws
are
intended
only
to
enforce
an
earnest
recommendation
that
the
surplus
revenues
of
the
government
be
prevented
by
the
reduction
of
our
customs
duties
and
at
the
same
time
to
emphasize
a
suggestion
that
in
accomplishing
this
purpose
we
may
discharge
a
double
duty
to
our
people
by
granting
to
them
a
measure
of
relief
from
tariff
taxation
in
quarters
where
it
is
most
needed
and
from
sources
where
it
can
be
most
fairly
and
justly
accorded
nor
can
the
presentation
made
of
such
considerations
be
with
any
degree
of
fairness
regarded
as
evidence
of
unfriendliness
toward
our
manufacturing
interests
or
of
any
lack
of
appreciation
of
their
value
and
importance
these
interests
constitute
a
leading
and
most
substantial
element
of
our
national
greatness
and
furnish
the
proud
proof
of
our
countrys
progress
but
if
in
the
emergency
that
presses
upon
us
our
manufacturers
are
asked
to
surrender
something
for
the
public
good
and
to
avert
disaster
their
patriotism
as
well
as
a
grateful
recognition
of
advantages
already
afforded
should
lead
them
to
willing
cooperation
no
demand
is
made
that
they
shall
forego
all
the
benefits
of
governmental
regard
but
they
can
not
fail
to
be
admonished
of
their
duty
as
well
as
their
enlightened
selfinterest
and
safety
when
they
are
reminded
of
the
fact
that
financial
panic
and
collapse
to
which
the
present
condition
tends
afford
no
greater
shelter
or
protection
to
our
manufactures
than
to
other
important
enterprises
opportunity
for
safe
careful
and
deliberate
reform
is
now
offered
and
none
of
us
should
be
unmindful
of
a
time
when
an
abused
and
irritated
people
heedless
of
those
who
have
resisted
timely
and
reasonable
relief
may
insist
upon
a
radical
and
sweeping
rectification
of
their
wrongs
the
difficulty
attending
a
wise
and
fair
revision
of
our
tariff
laws
is
not
underestimated
it
will
require
on
the
part
of
the
congress
great
labor
and
care
and
especially
a
broad
and
national
contemplation
of
the
subject
and
a
patriotic
disregard
of
such
local
and
selfish
claims
as
are
unreasonable
and
reckless
of
the
welfare
of
the
entire
country
under
our
present
laws
more
than
articles
are
subject
to
duty
many
of
these
do
not
in
any
way
compete
with
our
own
manufactures
and
many
are
hardly
worth
attention
as
subjects
of
revenue
a
considerable
reduction
can
be
made
in
the
aggregate
by
adding
them
to
the
free
list
the
taxation
of
luxuries
presents
no
features
of
hardship
but
the
necessaries
of
life
used
and
consumed
by
all
the
people
the
duty
upon
which
adds
to
the
cost
of
living
in
every
home
should
be
greatly
cheapened
the
radical
reduction
of
the
duties
imposed
upon
raw
material
used
in
manufactures
or
its
free
importation
is
of
course
an
important
factor
in
any
effort
to
reduce
the
price
of
these
necessaries
it
would
not
only
relieve
them
from
the
increased
cost
caused
by
the
tariff
on
such
material
but
the
manufactured
product
being
thus
cheapened
that
part
of
the
tariff
now
laid
upon
such
product
as
a
compensation
to
our
manufacturers
for
the
present
price
of
raw
material
could
be
accordingly
modified
such
reduction
or
free
importation
would
serve
besides
to
largely
reduce
the
revenue
it
is
not
apparent
how
such
a
change
can
have
any
injurious
effect
upon
our
manufacturers
on
the
contrary
it
would
appear
to
give
them
a
better
chance
in
foreign
markets
with
the
manufacturers
of
other
countries
who
cheapen
their
wares
by
free
material
thus
our
people
might
have
the
opportunity
of
extending
their
sales
beyond
the
limits
of
home
consumption
saving
them
from
the
depression
interruption
in
business
and
loss
caused
by
a
glutted
domestic
market
and
affording
their
employees
more
certain
and
steady
labor
with
its
resulting
quiet
and
contentment
the
question
thus
imperatively
presented
for
solution
should
be
approached
in
a
spirit
higher
than
partisanship
and
considered
in
the
light
of
that
regard
for
patriotic
duty
which
should
characterize
the
action
of
those
intrusted
with
the
weal
of
a
confiding
people
but
the
obligation
to
declared
party
policy
and
principle
is
not
wanting
to
urge
prompt
and
effective
action
both
of
the
great
political
parties
now
represented
in
the
government
have
by
repeated
and
authoritative
declarations
condemned
the
condition
of
our
laws
which
permit
the
collection
from
the
people
of
unnecessary
revenue
and
have
in
the
most
solemn
manner
promised
its
correction
and
neither
as
citizens
nor
partisans
are
our
countrymen
in
a
mood
to
condone
the
deliberate
violation
of
these
pledges
our
progress
toward
a
wise
conclusion
will
not
be
improved
by
dwelling
upon
the
theories
of
protection
and
free
trade
this
savors
too
much
of
bandying
epithets
it
is
a
condition
which
confronts
us
not
a
theory
relief
from
this
condition
may
involve
a
slight
reduction
of
the
advantages
which
we
award
our
home
productions
but
the
entire
withdrawal
of
such
advantages
should
not
be
contemplated
the
question
of
free
trade
is
absolutely
irrelevant
and
the
persistent
claim
made
in
certain
quarters
that
all
the
efforts
to
relieve
the
people
from
unjust
and
unnecessary
taxation
are
schemes
of
socalled
free
traders
is
mischievous
and
far
removed
from
any
consideration
for
the
public
good
the
simple
and
plain
duty
which
we
owe
the
people
is
to
reduce
taxation
to
the
necessary
expenses
of
an
economical
operation
of
the
government
and
to
restore
to
the
business
of
the
country
the
money
which
we
hold
in
the
treasury
through
the
perversion
of
governmental
powers
these
things
can
and
should
be
done
with
safety
to
all
our
industries
without
danger
to
the
opportunity
for
remunerative
labor
which
our
workingmen
need
and
with
benefit
to
them
and
all
our
people
by
cheapening
their
means
of
subsistence
and
increasing
the
measure
of
their
comforts
the
constitution
provides
that
the
president
shall
from
time
to
time
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
it
has
been
the
custom
of
the
executive
in
compliance
with
this
provision
to
annually
exhibit
to
the
congress
at
the
opening
of
its
session
the
general
condition
of
the
country
and
to
detail
with
some
particularity
the
operations
of
the
different
executive
departments
it
would
be
especially
agreeable
to
follow
this
course
at
the
present
time
and
to
call
attention
to
the
valuable
accomplishments
of
these
departments
during
the
last
fiscal
year
but
i
am
so
much
impressed
with
the
paramount
importance
of
the
subject
to
which
this
communication
has
thus
far
been
devoted
that
i
shall
forego
the
addition
of
any
other
topic
and
only
urge
upon
your
immediate
consideration
the
state
of
the
union
as
shown
in
the
present
condition
of
our
treasury
and
our
general
fiscal
situation
upon
which
every
element
of
our
safety
and
prosperity
depends
the
reports
of
the
heads
of
departments
which
will
be
submitted
contain
full
and
explicit
information
touching
the
transaction
of
the
business
intrusted
to
them
and
such
reco
mmendations
relating
to
legislation
in
the
public
interest
as
they
deem
advisable
i
ask
for
these
reports
and
recommendations
the
deliberate
examination
and
action
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
there
are
other
subjects
not
embraced
in
the
departmental
reports
demanding
legislative
consideration
and
which
i
should
be
glad
to
submit
some
of
them
however
have
been
earnestly
presented
in
previous
messages
and
as
to
them
i
beg
leave
to
repeat
prior
recommendations
as
the
law
makes
no
provision
for
any
report
from
the
department
of
state
a
brief
history
of
the
transactions
of
that
important
department
together
with
other
matters
which
it
may
hereafter
be
deemed
essential
to
commend
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
may
furnish
the
occasion
for
a
future
communication

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
discharge
of
a
constitutional
duty
and
following
a
wellestablished
precedent
in
the
executive
office
i
herewith
transmit
to
the
congress
at
its
reassembling
certain
information
concerning
the
state
of
the
union
together
with
such
recommendations
for
legislative
consideration
as
appear
necessary
and
expedient
our
government
has
consistently
maintained
its
relations
of
friendship
toward
all
other
powers
and
of
neighborly
interest
toward
those
whose
possessions
are
contiguous
to
our
own
few
questions
have
arisen
during
the
past
year
with
other
governments
and
none
of
those
are
beyond
the
reach
of
settlement
in
friendly
counsel
we
are
as
yet
without
provision
for
the
settlement
of
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
chile
for
injustice
during
the
late
war
with
peru
and
bolivia
the
mixed
commissions
organized
under
claims
conventions
concluded
by
the
chilean
government
with
certain
european
states
have
developed
an
amount
of
friction
which
we
trust
can
be
avoided
in
the
convention
which
our
representative
at
santiago
is
authorized
to
negotiate
the
cruel
treatment
of
inoffensive
chinese
has
i
regret
to
say
been
repeated
in
some
of
the
far
western
states
and
territories
and
acts
of
violence
against
those
people
beyond
the
power
of
the
local
constituted
authorities
to
prevent
and
difficult
to
punish
are
reported
even
in
distant
alaska
much
of
this
violence
can
be
traced
to
race
prejudice
and
competition
of
labor
which
can
not
however
justify
the
oppression
of
strangers
whose
safety
is
guaranteed
by
our
treaty
with
china
equally
with
the
most
favored
nations
in
opening
our
vast
domain
to
alien
elements
the
purpose
of
our
lawgivers
was
to
invite
assimilation
and
not
to
provide
an
arena
for
endless
antagonism
the
paramount
duty
of
maintaining
public
order
and
defending
the
interests
of
our
own
people
may
require
the
adoption
of
measures
of
restriction
but
they
should
not
tolerate
the
oppression
of
individuals
of
a
special
race
i
am
not
without
assurance
that
the
government
of
china
whose
friendly
disposition
toward
us
i
am
most
happy
to
recognize
will
meet
us
halfway
in
devising
a
comprehensive
remedy
by
which
an
effective
limitation
of
chinese
emigration
joined
to
protection
of
those
chinese
subjects
who
remain
in
this
country
may
be
secured
legislation
is
needed
to
execute
the
provisions
of
our
chinese
convention
of
touching
the
opium
traffic
while
the
good
will
of
the
colombian
government
toward
our
country
is
manifest
the
situation
of
american
interests
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
has
at
times
excited
concern
and
invited
friendly
action
looking
to
the
performance
of
the
engagements
of
the
two
nations
concerning
the
territory
embraced
in
the
interoceanic
transit
with
the
subsidence
of
the
isthmian
disturbances
and
the
erection
of
the
state
of
panama
into
a
federal
district
under
the
direct
government
of
the
constitutional
administration
at
bogota
a
new
order
of
things
has
been
inaugurated
which
although
as
yet
somewhat
experimental
and
affording
scope
for
arbitrary
exercise
of
power
by
the
delegates
of
the
national
authority
promises
much
improvement
the
sympathy
between
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
france
born
during
our
colonial
struggle
for
independence
and
continuing
today
has
received
a
fresh
impulse
in
the
successful
completion
and
dedication
of
the
colossal
statue
of
liberty
enlightening
the
world
in
new
york
harborthe
gift
of
frenchmen
to

a
convention
between
the
united
states
and
certain
other
powers
for
the
protection
of
submarine
cables
was
signed
at
paris
on
march
and
has
been
duly
ratified
and
proclaimed
by
this
government
by
agreement
between
the
high
contracting
parties
this
convention
is
to
go
into
effect
on
the
st
of
january
next
but
the
legislation
required
for
its
execution
in
the
united
states
has
not
yet
been
adopted
i
earnestly
recommend
its
enactment
cases
have
continued
to
occur
in
germany
giving
rise
to
much
correspondence
in
relation
to
the
privilege
of
sojourn
of
our
naturalized
citizens
of
german
origin
revisiting
the
land
of
their
birth
yet
i
am
happy
to
state
that
our
relations
with
that
country
have
lost
none
of
their
accustomed
cordiality
the
claims
for
interest
upon
the
amount
of
tonnage
dues
illegally
exacted
from
certain
german
steamship
lines
were
favorably
reported
in
both
houses
of
congress
at
the
last
session
and
i
trust
will
receive
final
and
favorable
action
at
an
early
day
the
recommendations
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
in
relation
to
a
mode
of
settlement
of
the
fishery
rights
in
the
waters
of
british
north
america
so
long
a
subject
of
anxious
difference
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
was
met
by
an
adverse
vote
of
the
senate
on
april
last
and
thereupon
negotiations
were
instituted
to
obtain
an
agreement
with
her
britannic
majestys
government
for
the
promulgation
of
such
joint
interpretation
and
definition
of
the
article
of
the
convention
of
relating
to
the
territorial
waters
and
inshore
fisheries
of
the
british
provinces
as
should
secure
the
canadian
rights
from
encroachment
by
the
united
states
fishermen
and
at
the
same
time
insure
the
enjoyment
by
the
latter
of
the
privileges
guaranteed
to
them
by
such
convention
the
questions
involved
are
of
long
standing
of
grave
consequence
and
from
time
to
time
for
nearly
threequarters
of
a
century
have
given
rise
to
earnest
international
discussions
not
unaccompanied
by
irritation
temporary
arrangements
by
treaties
have
served
to
allay
friction
which
however
has
revived
as
each
treaty
was
terminated
the
last
arrangement
under
the
treaty
of
was
abrogated
after
due
notice
by
the
united
states
on
june
but
i
was
enabled
to
obtain
for
our
fishermen
for
the
remainder
of
that
season
enjoyment
of
the
full
privileges
accorded
by
the
terminated
treaty
the
joint
high
commission
by
whom
the
treaty
had
been
negotiated
although
invested
with
plenary
power
to
make
a
permanent
settlement
were
content
with
a
temporary
arrangement
after
the
termination
of
which
the
question
was
relegated
to
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
of
as
to
the
first
article
of
which
no
construction
satisfactory
to
both
countries
has
ever
been
agreed
upon
the
progress
of
civilization
and
growth
of
population
in
the
british
provinces
to
which
the
fisheries
in
question
are
contiguous
and
the
expansion
of
commercial
intercourse
between
them
and
the
united
states
present
today
a
condition
of
affairs
scarcely
realizable
at
the
date
of
the
negotiations
of
new
and
vast
interests
have
been
brought
into
existence
modes
of
intercourse
between
the
respective
countries
have
been
invented
and
multiplied
the
methods
of
conducting
the
fisheries
have
been
wholly
changed
and
all
this
is
necessarily
entitled
to
candid
and
careful
consideration
in
the
adjustment
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
intercourse
and
commerce
between
the
united
states
and
their
neighbors
along
a
frontier
of
over
miles
this
propinquity
community
of
language
and
occupation
and
similarity
of
political
and
social
institutions
indicate
the
practicability
and
obvious
wisdom
of
maintaining
mutually
beneficial
and
friendly
relations
whilst
i
am
unfeignedly
desirous
that
such
relations
should
exist
between
us
and
the
inhabitants
of
canada
yet
the
action
of
their
officials
during
the
past
season
toward
our
fishermen
has
been
such
as
to
seriously
threaten
their
continuance
although
disappointed
in
my
efforts
to
secure
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
the
fishery
question
negotiations
are
still
pending
with
reasonable
hope
that
before
the
close
of
the
present
session
of
congress
announcement
may
be
made
that
an
acceptable
conclusion
has
been
reached
as
at
an
early
day
there
may
be
laid
before
congress
the
correspondence
of
the
department
of
state
in
relation
to
this
important
subject
so
that
the
history
of
the
past
fishing
season
may
be
fully
disclosed
and
the
action
and
the
attitude
of
the
administration
clearly
comprehended
a
more
extended
reference
is
not
deemed
necessary
in
this
communication
the
recommendation
submitted
last
year
that
provision
be
made
for
a
preliminary
reconnoissance
of
the
conventional
boundary
line
between
alaska
and
british
columbia
is
renewed
i
express
my
unhesitating
conviction
that
the
intimacy
of
our
relations
with
hawaii
should
be
emphasized
as
a
result
of
the
reciprocity
treaty
of
those
islands
on
the
highway
of
oriental
and
australasian
traffic
are
virtually
an
outpost
of
american
commerce
and
a
steppingstone
to
the
growing
trade
of
the
pacific
the
polynesian
island
groups
have
been
so
absorbed
by
other
and
more
powerful
governments
that
the
hawaiian
islands
are
left
almost
alone
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
autonomy
which
it
is
important
for
us
should
be
preserved
our
treaty
is
now
terminable
on
one
years
notice
but
propositions
to
abrogate
it
would
be
in
my
judgment
most
ill
advised
the
paramount
influence
we
have
there
acquired
once
relinquished
could
only
with
difficulty
be
regained
and
a
valuable
ground
of
vantage
for
ourselves
might
be
converted
into
a
stronghold
for
our
commercial
competitors
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
existing
treaty
stipulations
be
extended
for
a
further
term
of
seven
years
a
recently
signed
treaty
to
this
end
is
now
before
the
senate
the
importance
of
telegraphic
communication
between
those
islands
and
the
united
states
should
not
be
overlooked
the
question
of
a
general
revision
of
the
treaties
of
japan
is
again
under
discussion
at
tokyo
as
the
first
to
open
relations
with
that
empire
and
as
the
nation
in
most
direct
commercial
relations
with
japan
the
united
states
have
lost
no
opportunity
to
testify
their
consistent
friendship
by
supporting
the
just
claims
of
japan
to
autonomy
and
independence
among
nations
a
treaty
of
extradition
between
the
united
states
and
japan
the
first
concluded
by
that
empire
has
been
lately
proclaimed
the
weakness
of
liberia
and
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
effective
sovereignty
over
its
outlying
districts
have
exposed
that
republic
to
encroachment
it
can
not
be
for
gotten
that
this
distant
community
is
an
offshoot
of
our
own
system
owing
its
origin
to
the
associated
benevolence
of
american
citizens
whose
praiseworthy
efforts
to
create
a
nucleus
of
civilization
in
the
dark
continent
have
commanded
respect
and
sympathy
everywhere
especially
in
this
country
although
a
formal
protectorate
over
liberia
is
contrary
to
our
traditional
policy
the
moral
right
and
duty
of
the
united
states
to
assist
in
all
proper
ways
in
the
maintenance
of
its
integrity
is
obvious
and
has
been
consistently
announced
during
nearly
half
a
century
i
recommend
that
in
the
reorganization
of
our
navy
a
small
vessel
no
longer
found
adequate
to
our
needs
be
presented
to
liberia
to
be
employed
by
it
in
the
protection
of
its
coastwise
revenues
the
encouraging
development
of
beneficial
and
intimate
relations
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
which
has
been
so
marked
within
the
past
few
years
is
at
once
the
occasion
of
congratulation
and
of
friendly
solicitude
i
urgently
renew
my
former
representation
of
the
need
or
speedy
legislation
by
congress
to
carry
into
effect
the
reciprocity
commercial
convention
of
january
our
commercial
treaty
of
with
mexico
was
terminated
according
to
its
provisions
in
upon
notification
given
by
mexico
in
pursuance
of
her
announced
policy
of
recasting
all
her
commercial
treaties
mexico
has
since
concluded
with
several
foreign
governments
new
treaties
of
commerce
and
navigation
defining
alien
rights
of
trade
property
and
residence
treatment
of
shipping
consular
privileges
and
the
like
our
yet
unexecuted
reciprocity
convention
of
covers
none
of
these
points
the
settlement
of
which
is
so
necessary
to
good
relationship
i
propose
to
initiate
with
mexico
negotiations
for
a
new
and
enlarged
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
in
compliance
with
a
resolution
of
the
senate
i
communicated
to
that
body
on
august
last
and
also
to
the
house
of
representatives
the
correspondence
in
the
case
of
a
k
cutting
an
american
citizen
then
imprisoned
in
mexico
charged
with
the
commission
of
a
penal
offense
in
texas
of
which
a
mexican
citizen
was
the
object
after
demand
had
been
made
for
his
release
the
charge
against
him
was
amended
so
as
to
include
a
violation
of
mexican
law
within
mexican
territory
this
joinder
of
alleged
offenses
one
within
and
the
other
exterior
to
mexico
induced
me
to
order
a
special
investigation
of
the
case
pending
which
mr
cutting
was
released
the
incident
has
however
disclosed
a
claim
of
jurisdiction
by
mexico
novel
in
our
history
whereby
any
offense
committed
anywhere
by
a
foreigner
penal
in
the
place
of
its
commission
and
of
which
a
mexican
is
the
object
may
if
the
offender
be
found
in
mexico
be
there
tried
and
punished
in
conformity
with
mexican
laws
this
jurisdiction
was
sustained
by
the
courts
of
mexico
in
the
cutting
case
and
approved
by
the
executive
branch
of
that
government
upon
the
authority
of
a
mexican
statute
the
appellate
court
in
releasing
mr
cutting
decided
that
the
abandonment
of
the
complaint
by
the
mexican
citizen
aggrieved
by
the
alleged
crime
a
libelous
publication
removed
the
basis
of
further
prosecution
and
also
declared
justice
to
have
been
satisfied
by
the
enforcement
of
a
small
part
of
the
original
sentence
the
admission
of
such
a
pretension
would
be
attended
with
serious
results
invasive
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
government
and
highly
dangerous
to
our
citizens
in
foreign
lands
therefore
i
have
denied
it
and
protested
against
its
attempted
exercise
as
unwarranted
by
the
principles
of
law
and
international
usages
a
sovereign
has
jurisdiction
of
offenses
which
take
effect
within
his
territory
although
concocted
or
commenced
outside
of
it
but
the
right
is
denied
of
any
foreign
sovereign
to
punish
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
for
an
offense
consummated
on
our
soil
in
violation
of
our
laws
even
though
the
offense
be
against
a
subject
or
citizen
of
such
sovereign
the
mexican
statute
in
question
makes
the
claim
broadly
and
the
principle
if
conceded
would
create
a
dual
responsibility
in
the
citizen
and
lead
to
inextricable
confusion
destructive
of
that
certainty
in
the
law
which
is
an
essential
of
liberty
when
citizens
of
the
united
states
voluntarily
go
into
a
foreign
country
they
must
abide
by
the
laws
there
in
force
and
will
not
be
protected
by
their
own
government
from
the
consequences
of
an
offense
against
those
laws
committed
in
such
foreign
country
but
watchful
care
and
interest
of
this
government
over
its
citizens
are
not
relinquished
because
they
have
gone
abroad
and
if
charged
with
crime
committed
in
the
foreign
land
a
fair
and
open
trial
conducted
with
decent
regard
for
justice
and
humanity
will
be
demanded
for
them
with
less
than
that
this
government
will
not
be
content
when
the
life
or
liberty
of
its
citizens
is
at
stake
whatever
the
degree
to
which
extraterritorial
criminal
jurisdiction
may
have
been
formerly
allowed
by
consent
and
reciprocal
agreement
among
certain
of
the
european
states
no
such
doctrine
or
practice
was
ever
known
to
the
laws
of
this
country
or
of
that
from
which
our
institutions
have
mainly
been
derived
in
the
case
of
mexico
there
are
reasons
especially
strong
for
perfect
harmony
in
the
mutual
exercise
of
jurisdiction
nature
has
made
us
irrevocably
neighbors
and
wisdom
and
kind
feeling
should
make
us
friends
the
overflow
of
capital
and
enterprise
from
the
united
states
is
a
potent
factor
in
assisting
the
development
of
the
resources
of
mexico
and
in
building
up
the
prosperity
of
both
countries
to
assist
this
good
work
all
grounds
of
apprehension
for
the
security
of
person
and
property
should
be
removed
and
i
trust
that
in
the
interests
of
good
neighborhood
the
statute
referred
to
will
be
so
modified
as
to
eliminate
the
present
possibilities
of
danger
to
the
peace
of
the
two
countries
the
government
of
the
netherlands
has
exhibited
concern
in
relation
to
certain
features
of
our
tariff
laws
which
are
supposed
by
them
to
be
aimed
at
a
class
of
tobacco
produced
in
the
dutch
east
indies
comment
would
seem
unnecessary
upon
the
unwisdom
of
legislation
appearing
to
have
a
special
national
discrimination
for
its
object
which
although
unintentional
may
give
rise
to
injurious
retaliation
the
establishment
less
than
four
years
ago
of
a
legation
at
teheran
is
bearing
fruit
in
the
interest
exhibited
by
the
shahs
government
in
the
industrial
activity
of
the
united
states
and
the
opportunities
of
beneficial
interchanges
stable
government
is
now
happily
restored
in
peru
by
the
election
of
a
constitutional
president
and
a
period
of
rehabilitation
is
entered
upon
but
the
recovery
is
necessarily
slow
from
the
exhaustion
caused
by
the
late
war
and
civil
disturbances
a
convention
to
adjust
by
arbitration
claims
of
our
citizens
has
been
proposed
and
is
under
consideration
the
naval
officer
who
bore
to
siberia
the
testimonials
bestowed
by
congress
in
recognition
of
the
aid
given
to
the
jeannette
survivors
has
successfully
accomplished
his
mission
his
interesting
report
will
be
submitted
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
this
mark
of
appreciation
has
been
welcomed
by
the
russian
government
and
people
as
befits
the
traditional
friendship
of
the
two
countries
civil
perturbations
in
the
samoan
islands
have
during
the
past
few
years
been
a
source
of
considerable
embarrassment
to
the
three
governmentsgermany
great
britain
and
the
united
stateswhose
relations
and
extraterritorial
rights
in
that
important
group
are
guaranteed
by
treaties
the
weakness
of
the
native
administration
and
the
conflict
of
opposing
interests
in
the
islands
have
led
king
malietoa
to
seek
alliance
or
protection
in
some
one
quarter
regardless
of
the
distinct
engagements
whereby
no
one
of
the
three
treaty
powers
may
acquire
any
paramount
or
exclusive
interest
in
may
last
malietoa
offered
to
place
samoa
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states
and
the
late
consul
without
authority
assumed
to
grant
it
the
proceeding
was
promptly
disavowed
and
the
overzealous
official
recalled
special
agents
of
the
three
governments
have
been
deputed
to
examine
the
situation
in
the
islands
with
a
change
in
the
representation
of
all
three
powers
and
a
harmonious
understanding
between
them
the
peace
prosperity
autonomous
administration
and
neutrality
of
samoa
can
hardly
fail
to
be
secured
it
appearing
that
the
government
of
spain
did
not
extend
to
the
flag
of
the
united
states
in
the
antilles
the
full
measure
of
reciprocity
requisite
under
our
statute
for
the
continuance
of
the
suspension
of
discriminations
against
the
spanish
flag
in
our
ports
i
was
constrained
in
october
last
to
rescind
my
predecessors
proclamation
of
february
permitting
such
suspension
an
arrangement
was
however
speedily
reached
and
upon
notification
from
the
government
of
spain
that
all
differential
treatment
of
our
vessels
and
their
cargoes
from
the
united
states
or
from
any
foreign
country
had
been
completely
and
absolutely
relinquished
i
availed
myself
of
the
discretion
conferred
by
law
and
issued
on
the
th
of
october
my
proclamation
declaring
reciprocal
suspension
in
the
united
states
it
is
most
gratifying
to
bear
testimony
to
the
earnest
spirit
in
which
the
government
of
the
queen
regent
has
met
our
efforts
to
avert
the
initiation
of
commercial
discriminations
and
reprisals
which
are
ever
disastrous
to
the
material
interests
and
the
political
good
will
of
the
countries
they
may
affect
the
profitable
development
of
the
large
commercial
exchanges
between
the
united
states
and
the
spanish
antilles
is
naturally
an
object
of
solicitude
lying
close
at
our
doors
and
finding
here
their
main
markets
of
supply
and
demand
the
welfare
of
cuba
and
puerto
rico
and
their
production
and
trade
are
scarcely
less
important
to
us
than
to
spain
their
commercial
and
financial
movements
are
so
naturally
a
part
of
our
system
that
no
obstacle
to
fuller
and
freer
intercourse
should
be
permitted
to
exist
the
standing
instructions
of
our
representatives
at
madrid
and
havana
have
for
years
been
to
leave
no
effort
unessayed
to
further
these
ends
and
at
no
time
ha
s
the
equal
good
desire
of
spain
been
more
hopefully
manifested
than
now
the
government
of
spain
by
removing
the
consular
tonnage
fees
on
cargoes
shipped
to
the
antilles
and
by
reducing
passport
fees
has
shown
its
recognition
of
the
needs
of
less
trammeled
intercourse
an
effort
has
been
made
during
the
past
year
to
remove
the
hindrances
to
the
proclamation
of
the
treaty
of
naturalization
with
the
sublime
porte
signed
in
which
has
remained
inoperative
owing
to
a
disagreement
of
interpretation
of
the
clauses
relative
to
the
effects
of
the
return
to
and
sojourn
of
a
naturalized
citizen
in
the
land
of
origin
i
trust
soon
to
be
able
to
announce
a
favorable
settlement
of
the
differences
as
to
this
interpretation
it
has
been
highly
satisfactory
to
note
the
improved
treatment
of
american
missionaries
in
turkey
as
has
been
attested
by
their
acknowledgments
to
our
late
minister
to
that
government
of
his
successful
exertions
in
their
behalf
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
convention
of
december
with
venezuela
for
the
reopening
of
the
awards
of
the
caracas
commission
under
the
claims
convention
of
has
not
yet
been
effected
owing
to
the
delay
of
the
executive
of
that
republic
in
ratifying
the
measure
i
trust
that
this
postponement
will
be
brief
but
should
it
much
longer
continue
the
delay
may
well
be
regarded
as
a
rescission
of
the
compact
and
a
failure
on
the
part
of
venezuela
to
complete
an
arrangement
so
persistently
sought
by
her
during
many
years
and
assented
to
by
this
government
in
a
spirit
of
international
fairness
although
to
the
detriment
of
holders
of
bona
fide
awards
of
the
impugned
commission
i
renew
the
recommendation
of
my
last
annual
message
that
existing
legislation
concerning
citizenship
and
naturalization
be
revised
we
have
treaties
with
many
states
providing
for
the
renunciation
of
citizenship
by
naturalized
aliens
but
no
statute
is
found
to
give
effect
to
such
engagements
nor
any
which
provides
a
needed
central
bureau
for
the
registration
of
naturalized
citizens
experience
suggests
that
our
statutes
regulating
extradition
might
be
advantageously
amended
by
a
provision
for
the
transit
across
our
territory
now
a
convenient
thoroughfare
of
travel
from
one
foreign
country
to
another
of
fugitives
surrendered
by
a
foreign
government
to
a
third
state
such
provisions
are
not
unusual
in
the
legislation
of
other
countries
and
tend
to
prevent
the
miscarriage
of
justice
it
is
also
desirable
in
order
to
remove
present
uncertainties
that
authority
should
be
conferred
on
the
secretary
of
state
to
issue
a
certificate
in
case
of
an
arrest
for
the
purpose
of
extradition
to
the
officer
before
whom
the
proceeding
is
pending
showing
that
a
requisition
for
the
surrender
of
the
person
charged
has
been
duly
made
such
a
certificate
if
required
to
be
received
before
the
prisoners
examination
would
prevent
a
long
and
expensive
judicial
inquiry
into
a
charge
which
the
foreign
government
might
not
desire
to
press
i
also
recommend
that
express
provision
be
made
for
the
immediate
discharge
from
custody
of
persons
committed
for
extradition
where
the
president
is
of
opinion
that
surrender
should
not
be
made
the
drift
of
sentiment
in
civilized
communities
toward
full
recognition
of
the
rights
of
property
in
the
creations
of
the
human
intellect
has
brought
about
the
adoption
by
many
important
nations
of
an
international
copyright
convention
which
was
signed
at
berne
on
the
th
of
september
inasmuch
as
the
constitution
gives
to
the
congress
the
power
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts
by
securing
for
limited
times
to
authors
and
inventors
the
exclusive
right
to
their
respective
writings
and
discoveries
this
government
did
not
feel
warranted
in
becoming
a
signatory
pending
the
action
of
congress
upon
measures
of
international
copyright
now
before
it
but
the
right
of
adhesion
to
the
berne
convention
hereafter
has
been
reserved
i
trust
the
subject
will
receive
at
your
hands
the
attention
it
deserves
and
that
the
just
claims
of
authors
so
urgently
pressed
will
be
duly
heeded
representations
continue
to
be
made
to
me
of
the
injurious
effect
upon
american
artists
studying
abroad
and
having
free
access
to
the
art
collections
of
foreign
countries
of
maintaining
a
discriminating
duty
against
the
introduction
of
the
works
of
their
brother
artists
of
other
countries
and
i
am
induced
to
repeat
my
recommendation
for
the
abolition
of
that
tax
pursuant
to
a
provision
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
appropriation
act
approved
july
the
estimates
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
maintenance
of
the
consular
service
have
been
recast
on
the
basis
of
salaries
for
all
officers
to
whom
such
allowance
is
deemed
advisable
advantage
has
been
taken
of
this
to
redistribute
the
salaries
of
the
offices
now
appropriated
for
in
accordance
with
the
work
performed
the
importance
of
the
representative
duties
of
the
incumbent
and
the
cost
of
living
at
each
post
the
last
consideration
has
been
too
often
lost
sight
of
in
the
allowances
heretofore
made
the
compensation
which
may
suffice
for
the
decent
maintenance
of
a
worthy
and
capable
officer
in
a
position
of
onerous
and
representative
trust
at
a
post
readily
accessible
and
where
the
necessaries
of
life
are
abundant
and
cheap
may
prove
an
inadequate
pittance
in
distant
lands
where
the
better
part
of
a
years
pay
is
consumed
in
reaching
the
post
of
duty
and
where
the
comforts
of
ordinary
civilized
existence
can
only
be
obtained
with
difficulty
and
at
exorbitant
cost
i
trust
that
in
considering
the
submitted
schedules
no
mistaken
theory
of
economy
will
perpetuate
a
system
which
in
the
past
has
virtually
closed
to
deserving
talent
many
offices
where
capacity
and
attainments
of
a
high
order
are
indispensable
and
in
not
a
few
instances
has
brought
discredit
on
our
national
character
and
entailed
embarrassment
and
even
suffering
on
those
deputed
to
uphold
our
dignity
and
interests
abroad
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
earnestly
reiterate
the
practical
necessity
of
supplying
some
mode
of
trustworthy
inspection
and
report
of
the
manner
in
which
the
consulates
are
conducted
in
the
absence
of
such
reliable
information
efficiency
can
scarcely
be
rewarded
or
its
opposite
corrected
increasing
competition
in
trade
has
directed
attention
to
the
value
of
the
consular
reports
printed
by
the
department
of
state
and
the
efforts
of
the
government
to
extend
the
practical
usefulness
of
these
reports
have
created
a
wider
demand
for
them
at
home
and
a
spirit
of
emulation
abroad
constituting
a
record
at
the
changes
occurring
in
trade
and
of
the
progress
of
the
arts
and
invention
in
foreign
countries
they
are
much
sought
for
by
all
interested
in
the
subjects
which
they
embrace
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
exhibits
in
detail
the
condition
of
the
public
finances
and
of
the
several
branches
of
the
government
related
to
his
department
i
especially
direct
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
recommendations
contained
in
this
and
the
last
preceding
report
of
the
secretary
touching
the
simplification
and
amendment
of
the
laws
relating
to
the
collection
of
our
revenues
and
in
the
interest
of
economy
and
justice
to
the
government
i
hope
they
may
be
adopted
by
appropriate
legislation
the
ordinary
receipts
of
the
government
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
were
of
this
amount
was
received
from
customs
and
from
internal
revenue
the
total
receipts
as
here
stated
were
greater
than
for
the
previous
year
but
the
increase
from
customs
was
and
from
internal
revenue
making
a
gain
in
these
items
for
the
last
year
of
a
falling
off
in
other
resources
reducing
the
total
increase
to
the
smaller
amount
mentioned
the
expense
at
the
different
customhouses
of
collecting
this
increased
customs
revenue
was
less
than
the
expense
attending
the
collection
of
such
revenue
for
the
preceding
year
by
and
the
increased
receipts
of
internal
revenue
were
collected
at
a
cost
to
the
internalrevenue
bureau
less
than
the
expense
of
such
collection
for
the
previous
year
the
total
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
were
being
less
by
than
such
expenditures
for
the
year

leaving
a
surplus
in
the
treasury
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
of
as
against
at
the
close
of
the
previous
year
being
an
increase
in
such

ascertained
and
estimated
for

are
indicating
an
anticipated
surplus
at
the
close
of
the
year
of
the
total
value
of
the
exports
from
the
united
states
to
foreign
countries
during
the
fiscal
year
is
stated
and
compared
with
the
preceding
year
as
follows
the
value
of
some
of
our
leading
exports
during
the
last
fiscal
year
as
compared
with
the
value
of
the
same
for
the
year
immediately
preceding
is
here
given
and
furnishes
information
both
interesting
and
suggestive
our
imports
during
the
last
fiscal
year
as
compared
with
the
previous
year
were
as
follows
in
my
last
annual
message
to
the
congress
attention
was
directed
to
the
fact
that
the
revenues
of
the
government
exceeded
its
actual
needs
and
it
was
suggested
that
legislative
action
should
be
taken
to
relieve
the
people
from
the
unnecessary
burden
of
taxation
thus
made
apparent
in
view
of
the
pressing
importance
of
the
subject
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
again
urge
its
consideration
the
income
of
the
government
by
its
increased
volume
and
through
economies
in
its
collection
is
now
more
than
ever
in
excess
of
public
necessities
the
application
of
the
surplus
to
the
payment
of
such
portion
of
the
public
debt
as
is
now
at
our
option
subject
to
extinguishment
if
continued
at
the
rate
which
has
lately
prevailed
would
retire
that
class
of
indebtedness
within
less
than
one
year
from
this
date
thus
a
continuation
of
our
present
revenue
system
would
soon
result
in
the
receipt
of
an
annual

income
much
greater
than
necessary
to
meet
government
expenses
with
no
indebtedness
upon
which
it
could
be
applied
we
should
then
be
confronted
with
a
vast
quantity
of
money
the
circulating
medium
of
the
people
hoarded
in
the
treasury
when
it
should
be
in
their
hands
or
we
should
be
drawn
into
wasteful
public
extravagance
with
all
the
corrupting
national
demoralization
which
follows
in
its
train
but
it
is
not
the
simple
existence
of
this
surplus
and
its
threatened
attendant
evils
which
furnish
the
strongest
argument
against
our
present
scale
of
federal
taxation
its
worst
phase
is
the
exaction
of
such
a
surplus
through
a
perversion
of
the
relations
between
the
people
and
their
government
and
a
dangerous
departure
from
the
rules
which
limit
the
right
of
federal
taxation
good
government
and
especially
the
government
of
which
every
american
citizen
boasts
has
for
its
objects
the
protection
of
every
person
within
its
care
in
the
greatest
liberty
consistent
with
the
good
order
of
society
and
his
perfect
security
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
earnings
with
the
least
possible
diminution
for
public
needs
when
more
of
the
peoples
substance
is
exacted
through
the
form
of
taxation
than
is
necessary
to
meet
the
just
obligations
of
the
government
and
the
expense
of
its
economical
administration
such
exaction
becomes
ruthless
extortion
and
a
violation
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
a
free
government
the
indirect
manner
in
which
these
exactions
are
made
has
a
tendency
to
conceal
their
true
character
and
their
extent
but
we
have
arrived
at
a
stage
of
superfluous
revenue
which
has
aroused
the
people
to
a
realization
of
the
fact
that
the
amount
raised
professedly
for
the
support
of
the
government
is
paid
by
them
as
absolutely
if
added
to
the
price
of
the
things
which
supply
their
daily
wants
as
if
it
was
paid
at
fixed
periods
into
the
hand
of
the
tax
gatherer
those
who
toil
for
daily
wages
are
beginning
to
understand
that
capital
though
sometimes
vaunting
its
importance
and
clamoring
for
the
protection
and
favor
of
the
government
is
dull
and
sluggish
till
touched
by
the
magical
hand
of
labor
it
springs
into
activity
furnishing
an
occasion
for
federal
taxation
and
gaining
the
value
which
enables
it
to
bear
its
burden
and
the
laboring
man
is
thoughtfully
inquiring
whether
in
these
circumstances
and
considering
the
tribute
he
constantly
pays
into
the
public
treasury
as
he
supplies
his
daily
wants
he
receives
his
fair
share
of
advantages
there
is
also
a
suspicion
abroad
that
the
surplus
of
our
revenues
indicates
abnormal
and
exceptional
business
profits
which
under
the
system
which
produces
such
surplus
increase
without
corresponding
benefit
to
the
people
at
large
the
vast
accumulations
of
a
few
among
our
citizens
whose
fortunes
rivaling
the
wealth
of
the
most
favored
in
antidemocratic
nations
are
not
the
natural
growth
of
a
steady
plain
and
industrious
republic
our
farmers
too
and
those
engaged
directly
and
indirectly
in
supplying
the
products
of
agriculture
see
that
day
by
day
and
as
often
as
the
daily
wants
of
their
households
recur
they
are
forced
to
pay
excessive
and
needless
taxation
while
their
products
struggle
in
foreign
markets
with
the
competition
of
nations
which
by
allowing
a
freer
exchange
of
productions
than
we
permit
enable
their
people
to
sell
for
prices
which
distress
the
american
farmer
as
every
patriotic
citizen
rejoices
in
the
constantly
increasing
pride
of
our
people
in
american
citizenship
and
in
the
glory
of
our
national
achievements
and
progress
a
sentiment
prevails
that
the
leading
strings
useful
to
a
nation
in
its
infancy
may
well
be
to
a
great
extent
discarded
in
the
present
stage
of
american
ingenuity
courage
and
fearless
selfreliance
and
for
the
privilege
of
indulging
this
sentiment
with
true
american
enthusiasm
our
citizens
are
quite
willing
to
forego
an
idle
surplus
in
the
public
treasury
and
all
the
people
know
that
the
average
rate
of
federal
taxation
upon
imports
is
today
in
time
of
peace
but
little
less
while
upon
some
articles
of
necessary
consumption
it
is
actually
more
than
was
imposed
by
the
grievous
burden
willingly
borne
at
a
time
when
the
government
needed
millions
to
maintain
by
war
the
safety
and
integrity
of
the
union
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
government
to
collect
the
principal
part
of
its
revenues
by
a
tax
upon
imports
and
no
change
in
this
policy
is
desirable
but
the
present
condition
of
affairs
constrains
our
people
to
demand
that
by
a
revision
of
our
revenue
laws
the
receipts
of
the
government
shall
be
reduced
to
the
necessary
expense
of
its
economical
administration
and
this
demand
should
be
recognized
and
obeyed
by
the
peoples
representatives
in
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
in
readjusting
the
burdens
of
federal
taxation
a
sound
public
policy
requires
that
such
of
our
citizens
as
have
built
up
large
and
important
industries
under
present
conditions
should
not
be
suddenly
and
to
their
injury
deprived
of
advantages
to
which
they
have
adapted
their
business
but
if
the
public
good
requires
it
they
should
be
content
with
such
consideration
as
shall
deal
fairly
and
cautiously
with
their
interests
while
the
just
demand
of
the
people
for
relief
from
needless
taxation
is
honestly
answered
a
reasonable
and
timely
submission
to
such
a
demand
should
certainly
be
possible
without
disastrous
shock
to
any
interest
and
a
cheerful
concession
sometimes
averts
abrupt
and
heedless
action
often
the
outgrowth
of
impatience
and
delayed
justice
due
regard
should
be
also
accorded
in
any
proposed
readjustment
to
the
interests
of
american
labor
so
far
as
they
are
involved
we
congratulate
ourselves
that
there
is
among
us
no
laboring
class
fixed
within
unyielding
bounds
and
doomed
under
all
conditions
to
the
inexorable
fate
of
daily
toil
we
recognize
in
labor
a
chief
factor
in
the
wealth
of
the
republic
and
we
treat
those
who
have
it
in
their
keeping
as
citizens
entitled
to
the
most
careful
regard
and
thoughtful
attention
this
regard
and
attention
should
be
awarded
them
not
only
because
labor
is
the
capital
of
our
workingmen
justly
entitled
to
its
share
of
government
favor
but
for
the
further
and
not
less
important
reason
that
the
laboring
man
surrounded
by
his
family
in
his
humble
home
as
a
consumer
is
vitally
interested
in
all
that
cheapens
the
cost
of
living
and
enables
him
to
bring
within
his
domestic
circle
additional
comforts
and
advantages
this
relation
of
the
workingman
to
the
revenue
laws
of
the
country
and
the
manner
in
which
it
palpably
influences
the
question
of
wages
should
not
be
forgotten
in
the
justifiable
prominence
given
to
the
proper
maintenance
of
the
supply
and
protection
of
wellpaid
labor
and
these
considerations
suggest
such
an
arrangement
of
government
revenues
as
shall
reduce
the
expense
of
living
while
it
does
not
curtail
the
opportunity
for
work
nor
reduce
the
compensation
of
american
labor
and
injuriously
affect
its
condition
and
the
dignified
place
it
holds
in
the
estimation
of
our
people
but
our
farmers
and
agriculturiststhose
who
from
the
soil
produce
the
things
consumed
by
allare
perhaps
more
directly
and
plainly
concerned
than
any
other
of
our
citizens
in
a
just
and
careful
system
of
federal
taxation
those
actually
engaged
in
and
more
remotely
connected
with
this
kind
of
work
number
nearly
onehalf
of
our
population
none
labor
harder
or
more
continuously
than
they
no
enactments
limit
their
hours
of
toil
and
no
interposition
of
the
government
enhances
to
any
great
extent
the
value
of
their
products
and
yet
for
many
of
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
which
the
most
scrupulous
economy
enables
them
to
bring
into
their
homes
and
for
their
implements
of
husbandry
they
are
obliged
to
pay
a
price
largely
increased
by
an
unnatural
profit
which
by
the
action
of
the
government
is
given
to
the
more
favored
manufacturer
i
recommend
that
keeping
in
view
all
these
considerations
the
increasing
and
unnecessary
surplus
of
national
income
annually
accumulating
be
released
to
the
people
by
an
amendment
to
our
revenue
laws
which
shall
cheapen
the
price
of
the
necessaries
of
life
and
give
freer
entrance
to
such
imported
materials
as
by
american
labor
may
be
manufactured
into
marketable
commodities
nothing
can
be
accomplished
however
in
the
direction
of
this
muchneeded
reform
unless
the
subject
is
approached
in
a
patriotic
spirit
of
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
entire
country
and
with
a
willingness

during
the
twelve

ended

per

were
called
for

amounting
to
of
which
was
so
called
to
answer
the
requirements
of
the
law
relating
to
the
sinking

and
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
public
debt
by
application
of
a
part
of
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
to
that
object
of
the
bonds
thus
called
became
subject
under
such
calls
to
redemption
prior
to
november

remainder
amounting
to
matured
under
the
calls
after
that
date
in
addition
to
the
amount
subject
to
payment
and
cancellation
prior
to

there
were
also
paid
before
that
day
certain
of
these
bonds
with
the
interest
thereon
amounting
to
which
were
anticipated
as
to
their
maturity
of
which
had
not
been
called
thus
had
been
actually
applied
prior
to
the
st
of
november
to
the
extinguishment
of
our
bonded
and
interestbearing
debt
leaving
on
that
day
still
outstanding
the
sum
of
of
this
amount
were
still
represented
by
per
cent
bonds
they
however
have
been
since
november
or
will
at
once
be
further
reduced
by
being
bonds
which
have

there
were
coined
under
the
compulsory
silvercoinage
act
of
silver

and
the
cost
of
the
silver
used
in
such
coinage
was
there
had
been
coined
up
to
the
close
of
the
previous
fiscal
year
under
the
provisions
of
the
law
silver
dollars
and
on
the
st
day
of
december
the
total
amount
of
such
coinage
was
the
director
of
the
mint
reports
that
a
t
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
law
of
directing
this
coinage
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
dollars
thus
coined
was
cents
each
and
that
on
the
st
day
of
july
the
price
of
silver
reached
the
lowest
stage
ever
known
so
that
the
intrinsic
or
bullion
price
of
our
standard
silver
dollar
at
that
date
was
less
than
cents
the
price
of
silver
on
the
th
day
of
november
last
was
such
as
to
make
these
dollars
intrinsically
worth
cents
each
these
differences
in
value
of
the
coins
represent
the
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
silver
and
they
certainly
do
not
indicate
that
compulsory
coinage
by
the
government
enhances
the
price
of
that
commodity
or
secures
uniformity
in
its
value
every
fair
and
legal
effort
has
been
made
by
the
treasury
department
to
distribute
this
currency
among
the
people
the
withdrawal
of
united
states
treasury
notes
of
small
denominations
and
the
issuing
of
small
silver
certificates
have
been
resorted
to
in
the
endeavor
to
accomplish
this
result
in
obedience
to
the
will
and
sentiments
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
the
congress
on
the
th
day
of
november
the
people
held
of
these
coins
or
certificates
representing
them
the
nominal
sum
of
and
we
still
had
in
the
treasury
as
against
about
so
in
the
hands
of
the
people
and
remaining
in
the
treasury
one
year
ago
the
director
of
the
mint
again
urges
the
necessity
of
more
vault
room
for
the
purpose
of
storing
these
silver
dollars
which
are
not
needed
for
circulation
by
the
people
i
have
seen
no
reason
to
change
the
views
expressed
in
my
last
annual
message
on
the
subject
of
this
compulsory
coinage
and
i
again
urge
its
suspension
on
all
the
grounds
contained
in
my
former
recommendation
reenforced
by
the
significant
increase
of
our
gold
exportations
during
the
last
year
as
appears
by
the
comparative
statement
herewith
presented
and
for
the
further
reasons
that
the
more
this
currency
is
distributed
among
the
people
the
greater
becomes
our
duty
to
protect
it
from
disaster
that
we
now
have
abundance
for
all
our
needs
and
that
there
seems
but
little
propriety
in
building
vaults
to
store
such
currency
when
the
only
pretense
for
its
coinage
is
the
necessity
of
its
use
by
the
people
as
a
circulating
medium
the
great
number
of
suits
now
pending
in
the
united
states
courts
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
growing
out
of
the
collection
of
customs
revenue
at
the
port
of
new
york
and
the
number
of
such
suits
that
are
almost
daily
instituted
are
certainly
worthy
the
attention
of
the
congress
these
legal
controversies
based
upon
conflicting
views
by
importers
and
the
collector
as
to
the
interpretation
of
our
present
complex
and
indefinite
revenue
laws
might
be
largely
obviated
by
an
amendment
of
those
laws
but
pending
such
amendment
the
present
condition
of
this
litigation
should
be
relieved
there
are
now
pending
about
of
these
suits
more
than
have
been
commenced
within
the
past
eighteen
months
and
many
of
the
others
have
been
at
issue
for
more
than
twentyfive
years
these
delays
subject
the
government
to
loss
of
evidence
and
prevent
the
preparation
necessary
to
defeat
unjust
and
fictitious
claims
while
constantly
accruing
interest
threatens
to
double
the
demands
involved
in
the
present
condition
of
the
dockets
of
the
courts
well
filled
with
private
suits
and
of
the
force
allowed
the
district
attorney
no
greater
than
is
necessary
for
the
ordinary
and
current
business
of
his
office
these
revenue
litigations
can
not
be
considered
in
default
of
the
adoption
by
the
congress
of
a
plan
for
the
general
reorganization
of
the
federal
courts
as
has
been
heretofore
recommended
i
urge
the
propriety
of
passing
a
law
permitting
the
appointment
of
an
additional
federal
judge
in
the
district
where
these
government
suits
have
accumulated
so
that
by
continuous
sessions
of
the
courts
devoted
to
the
trial
of
these
cases
they
may
be
determined
it
is
entirely
plain
that
a
great
saving
to
the
government
would
be
accomplished
by
such
a
remedy
and
the
suitors
who
have
honest
claims
would
not
be
denied
justice
through
delay
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
gives
a
detailed
account
of
the
administration
of
his
department
and
contains
sundry
recommendations
for
the
improvement
of
the
service
which
i
fully
approve
the
army
consisted
at
the
date
of
the
last
consolidated
return
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
the
expenses
of
the
department
for
the
last
fiscal
year
were
including
for
public
works
and
river
and
harbor
improvements
i
especially
direct
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
recommendation
that
officers
be
required
to
submit
to
an
examination
as
a
preliminary
to
their
promotion
i
see
no
objection
but
many
advantages
in
adopting
this
feature
which
has
operated
so
beneficially
in
our
navy
department
as
well
as
in
some
branches
of
the
army
the
subject
of
coast
defenses
and
fortifications
has
been
fully
and
carefully
treated
by
the
board
on
fortifications
whose
report
was
submitted
at
the
last
session
of
congress
but
no
construction
work
of
the
kind
recommended
by
the
board
has
been
possible
during
the
last
year
from
the
lack
of
appropriations
for
such
purpose
the
defenseless
condition
of
our
seacoast
and
lake
frontier
is
perfectly
palpable
the
examinations
made
must
convince
us
all
that
certain
of
our
cities
named
in
the
report
of
the
board
should
be
fortified
and
that
work
on
the
most
important
of
these
fortifications
should
be
commenced
at
once
the
work
has
been
thoroughly
considered
and
laid
out
the
secretary
of
war
reports
but
all
is
delayed
in
default
of
congressional
action
the
absolute
necessity
judged
by
all
standards
of
prudence
and
foresight
of
our
preparation
for
an
effectual
resistance
against
the
armored
ships
and
steel
guns
and
mortars
of
modern
construction
which
may
threaten
the
cities
on
our
coasts
is
so
apparent
that
i
hope
effective
steps
will
be
taken
in
that
direction
immediately
the
valuable
and
suggestive
treatment
of
this
question
by
the
secretary
of
war
is
earnestly
commended
to
the
consideration
of
the
congress
in
september
and
october
last
the
hostile
apaches
who
under
the
leadership
of
geronimo
had
for
eighteen
months
been
on
the
war
path
and
during
that
time
had
committed
many
murders
and
been
the
cause
of
constant
terror

the
settlers

military

who
succeeded
general
crook
in
the
management
and
direction
of
their
pursuit
under
the
terms
of
their
surrender
as
then
reported
and
in
view
of
the
understanding
which
these
murderous
savages
seemed
to
entertain
of
the
assurances
given
them
it
was
considered
best
to
imprison
them
in
such
manner
as
to
prevent
their
ever
engaging
in
such
outrages
again
instead
of
trying
them
for
murder
fort

been
selected
as
a

the
meantime

as

the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
contains
a
detailed
exhibit
of
the
condition
of
his
department
with
such
a
statement
of
the
action
needed
to
improve
the
same
as
should
challenge
the
earnest
attention
of
the
congress
the
present
navy
of
the
united
states
aside
from
the
ships
in
course
of
construction
consists
of
first
fourteen
singleturreted
monitors
none
of
which
are
in
commission
nor
at
the
present
time
serviceable
the
batteries
of
these
ships
are
obsolete
and
they
can
only
be
relied
upon
as
auxiliary
ships
in
harbor
defense
and
then
after
such
an
expenditure
upon
them
as
might
not
be
deemed
justifiable
second
five
fourthrate
vessels
of
small
tonnage
only
one
of
which
was
designed
as
a
war
vessel
and
all
of
which
are
auxiliary
merely
third
twentyseven
cruising
ships
three
of
which
are
built
of
iron
of
small
tonnage
and
twentyfour
of
wood
of
these
wooden
vessels
it
is
estimated
by
the
chief
constructor
of
the
navy
that
only
three
will
be
serviceable
beyond
a
period
of
six
years
at
which
time
it
may
be
said
that
of
the
present
naval
force
nothing
worthy
the
name
will
remain
all
the
vessels
heretofore
authorized
are
under
contract
or
in
course
of
construction
except
the
armored
ships
the
torpedo
and
dynamite
boats
and
one
cruiser
as
to
the
last
of
these
the
bids
were
in
excess
of
the
limit
fixed
by
congress
the
production
in
the
united
states
of
armor
and
gun
steel
is
a
question
which
it
seems
necessary
to
settle
at
an
early
day
if
the
armored
war
vessels
are
to
be
completed
with
those
materials
of
home
manufacture
this
has
been
the
subject
of
investigation
by
two
boards
and
by
two
special
committees
of
congress
within
the
last
three
years
the
report
of
the
gun
foundry
board
in
of
the
board
on
fortifications
made
in
january
last
and
the
reports
of
the
select
committees
of
the
two
houses
made
at
the
last
session
of
congress
have
entirely
exhausted
the
subject
so
far
as
preliminary
investigation
is
involved
and
in
their
recommendations
they
are
substantially
agreed
in
the
event
that
the
present
invitation
of
the
department
for
bids
to
furnish
such
of
this
material
as
is
now
authorized
shall
fail
to
induce
domestic
manufacturers
to
undertake
the
large
expenditures
required
to
prepare
for
this
new
manufacture
and
no
other
steps
are
taken
by
congress
at
its
coming
session
the
secretary
contemplates
with
dissatisfaction
the
necessity
of
obtaining
abroad
the
armor
and
the
gun
steel
for
the
authorized
ships
it
would
seem
desirable
that
the
wants
of
the
army
and
the
navy
in
this
regard
should
be
reasonably
met
and
that
by
uniting
their
contracts
such
inducement
might
be
offered
as
would
result
in
securing
the
domestication
of
these
important
interests
the
affairs
of
the
postal
service
show
marked
and
gratifying
improvement
during
the
past
year
a
particular
account
of
its
transactions
and
condition
i
s
given
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
which
will
be
laid
before
you
the
reduction
of
the
rate
of
letter
postage
in
rendering
the
postal
revenues
inadequate
to
sustain
the
expenditures
and
business
depression
also
contributing
resulted
in
an
excess
of
cost
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
of
eight
and
onethird
millions
of
dollars
an
additional
check
upon
receipts
by
doubling
the
measure
of
weight
in
rating
sealed
correspondence
and
diminishing
onehalf
the
charge
for
newspaper
carriage
was
imposed
by
legislation
which
took
effect
with
the
beginning
of
the
past
fiscal
year
while
the
constant
demand
of
our
territorial
development
and
growing
population
for
the
extension
and
increase
of
mail
facilities
and
machinery
necessitates
steady
annual
advance
in
outlay
and
the
careful
estimate
of
a
year
ago
upon
the
rates
of
expenditure
then
existing
contemplated
the
unavoidable
augmentation
of
the
deficiency
in
the
last
fiscal
year
by
nearly
the
anticipated
revenue
for
the
last
year
failed
of
realization
by
about
but
proper
measures
of
economy
have
so
satisfactorily
limited
the
growth
of
expenditure
that
the
total
deficiency
in
fact
fell
below
that
of
and
at
this
time
the
increase
of
revenue
is
in
a
gaining
ratio
over
the
increase
of
cost
demonstrating
the
sufficiency
of
the
present
rates
of
postage
ultimately
to
sustain
the
service
this
is
the
more
pleasing
because
our
people
enjoy
now
both
cheaper
postage
proportionably
to
distances
and
a
vaster
and
more
costly
service
than
any
other
upon
the
globe
retrenchment
has
been
effected
in
the
cost
of
supplies
some
expenditures
unwarranted
by
law
have
ceased
and
the
outlays
for
mail
carriage
have
been
subjected
to
beneficial
scrutiny
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
the
expense
of
transportation
on
star
routes
stood
at
an
annual
rate
of
cost
less
by
over
than
at
the
close
of
the
previous
year
and
steamboat
and
mailmessenger
service
at
nearly
less
the
service
has
been
in
the
meantime
enlarged
and
extended
by
the
establishment
of
new
offices
increase
of
routes
of
carriage
expansion
of
carrierdelivery
conveniences
and
additions
to
the
railway
mail
facilities
in
accordance
with
the
growing
exigencies
of
the
country
and
the
longestablished
policy
of
the
government
the
postmastergeneral
calls
attention
to
the
existing
law
for
compensating
railroads
and
expresses
the
opinion
that
a
method
may
be
devised
which
will
prove
more
just
to
the
carriers
and
beneficial
to
the
government
and
the
subject
appears
worthy
of
your
early
consideration
the
differences
which
arose
during
the
year
with
certain
of
the
ocean
steamship
companies
have
terminated
by
the
acquiescence
of
all
in
the
policy
of
the
government
approved
by
the
congress
in
the
postal
appropriation
at
its
last
session
and
the
department
now
enjoys
the
utmost
service
afforded
by
all
vessels
which
sail
from
our
ports
upon
either
oceana
service
generally
adequate
to
the
needs
of
our
intercourse
petitions
have
however
been
presented
to
the
department
by
numerous
merchants
and
manufacturers
for
the
establishment
of
a
direct
service
to
the
argentine
republic
and
for
semimonthly
dispatches
to
the
empire
of
brazil
and
the
subject
is
commended
to
your
consideration
it
is
an
obvious
duty
to
provide
the
means
of
postal
communication
which
our
commerce
requires
and
with
prudent
forecast
of
results
the
wise
extension
of
it
may
lead
to
stimulating
intercourse
and
become
the
harbinger
of
a
profitable
traffic
which
will
open
new
avenues
for
the
disposition
of
the
products
of
our
industry
the
circumstances
of
the
countries
at
the
far
south
of
our
continent
are
such
as
to
invite
our
enterprise
and
afford
the
promise
of
sufficient
advantages
to
justify
an
unusual
effort
to
bring
about
the
closer
relations
which
greater
freedom
of
communication
would
tend
to
establish
i
suggest
that
as
distinguished
from
a
grant
or
subsidy
for
the
mere
benefit
of
any
line
of
trade
or
travel
whatever
outlay
may
be
required
to
secure
additional
postal
service
necessary
and
proper
and
not
otherwise
attainable
should
be
regarded
as
within
the
limit
of
legitimate
compensation
for
such
service
the
extension
of
the
freedelivery
service
as
suggested
by
the
postmastergeneral
has
heretofore
received
my
sanction
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
a
suitable
enactment
may
soon
be
agreed
upon
the
request
for
an
appropriation
sufficient
to
enable
the
general
inspection
of
fourthclass
offices
has
my
approbation
i
renew
my
approval
of
the
recommendation
of
the
postmastergeneral
that
another
assistant
be
provided
for
the
postoffice
department
and
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
several
other
recommendations
in
his
report
the
conduct
of
the
department
of
justice
for
the
last
fiscal
year
is
fully
detailed
in
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
and
i
invite
the
earnest
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
same
and
due
consideration
of
the
recommendations
therein
contained
in
the
report
submitted
by
this
officer
to
the
last
session
of
the
congress
he
strongly
recommended
the
erection
of
a
penitentiary
for
the
confinement
of
prisoners
convicted
and
sentenced
in
the
united
states
courts
and
he
repeats
the
recommendation
in
his
report
for
the
last
year
this
is
a
matter
of
very
great
importance
and
should
at
once
receive
congressional
action
united
states
prisoners
are
now
confined
in
more
than
thirty
different
state
prisons
and
penitentiaries
scattered
in
every
part
of
the
country
they
are
subjected
to
nearly
as
many
different
modes
of
treatment
and
discipline
and
are
far
too
much
removed
from
the
control
and
regulation
of
the
government
so
far
as
they
are
entitled
to
humane
treatment
and
an
opportunity
for
improvement
and
reformation
the
government
is
responsible
to
them
and
society
that
these
things
are
forthcoming
but
this
duty
can
scarcely
be
discharged
without
more
absolute
control
and
direction
than
is
possible
under
the
present
system
many
of
our
good
citizens
have
interested
themselves
with
the
most
beneficial
results
in
the
question
of
prison
reform
the
general
government
should
be
in
a
situation
since
there
must
be
united
states
prisoners
to
furnish
important
aid
in
this
movement
and
should
be
able
to
illustrate
what
may
be
practically
done
in
the
direction
of
this
reform
and
to
present
an
example
in
the
treatment
and
improvement
of
its
prisoners
worthy
of
imitation
with
prisons
under
its
own
control
the
government
could
deal
with
the
somewhat
vexed
question
of
convict
labor
so
far
as
its
convicts
were
concerned
according
to
a
plan
of
its
own
adoption
and
with
due
regard
to
the
rights
and
interests
of
our
laboring
citizens
instead
of
sometimes
aiding
in
the
operation
of
a
system
which
causes
among
them
irritation
and
discontent
upon
consideration
of
this
subject
it
might
be
thought
wise
to
erect
more
than
one
of
these
institutions
located
in
such
places
as
would
best
subserve
the
purposes
of
convenience
and
economy
in
transportation
the
considerable
cost
of
maintaining
these
convicts
as
at
present
in
state
institutions
would
be
saved
by
the
adoption
of
the
plan
proposed
and
by
employing
them
in
the
manufacture
of
such
articles
as
were
needed
for
use
by
the
government
quite
a
large
pecuniary
benefit
would
be
realized
in
partial
return
for
our
outlay
i
again
urge
a
change
in
the
federal
judicial
system
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
people
and
obviate
the
delays
necessarily
attending
the
present
condition
of
affairs
in
our
courts
all
are
agreed
that
something
should
be
done
and
much
favor
is
shown
by
those
well
able
to
advise
to
the
plan
suggested
by
the
attorneygeneral
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
and
recommended
in
my
last
annual
message
this
recommendation
is
here
renewed
together
with
another
made
at
the
same
time
touching
a
change
in
the
manner
of
compensating
district
attorneys
and
marshals
and
the
latter
subject
is
commended
to
the
congress
for
its
action
in
the
interest
of
economy
to
the
government
and
humanity
fairness
and
justice
to
our
people
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
presents
a
comprehensive
summary
of
the
work
of
the
various
branches
of
the
public
service
connected
with
his
department
and
the
suggestions
and
recommendations
which
it
contains
for
the
improvement
of
the
service
should
receive
your
careful
consideration
the
exhibit
made
of
the
condition
of
our
indian
population
and
the
progress
of
the
work
for
their
enlightenment
notwithstanding
the
many
embarrassments
which
hinder
the
better
administration
of
this
important
branch
of
the
service
is
a
gratifying
and
hopeful
one
the
funds
appropriated
for
the
indian
service
for
the
fiscal
year
just
passed
with
the
available
income
from
indian
land
and
trust
moneys
amounting
in
all
to
were
ample
for
the
service
under
the
conditions
and
restrictions
of
laws
regulating
their
expenditure
there
remained
a
balance
on
hand
on
june
of
of
which
are
permanent
funds
for
fulfillment
of
treaties
and
other
like
purposes
and
the
remainder
is
subject
to
be
carried
to
the
surplus
fund
as
required
by
law
the
estimates
presented
for
appropriations
for
the
ensuing
fiscal
year
amount
to
or
less
than
those
laid
before
the
congress
last
year
the
present
system
of
agencies
while
absolutely
necessary
and
well
adapted
for
the
management
of
our
indian
affairs
and
for
the
ends
in
view
when
it
was
adopted
is
in
the
present
stage
of
indian
management
inadequate
standing
alone
for
the
accomplishment
of
an
object
which
has
become
pressing
in
its
importancethe
more
rapid
transition
from
tribal
organizations
to
citizenship
of
such
portions
of
the
indians
as
are
capable
of
civilized
life
when
the
existing
system
was
adopted
the
indian
race
was
outside
of
the
limits
of
organized
states
and
territories
and
beyond
the
immediate
reach
and
operation
of
civilization
and
all
efforts
were
mainly
directed
to
the
maintenance
of
friendly
relations
and
the
preservation
of
peace
and
quiet
on
the
frontier
all
this
is
now
changed
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
indian
frontier
civilization
with
the
busy
hum
of
industry
and
the
influences
of
christianity
surrounds
the
se
people
at
every
point
none
of
the
tribes
are
outside
of
the
bounds
of
organized
government
and
society
except
that
the
territorial
system
has
not
been
extended
over
that
portion
of
the
country
known
as
the
indian
territory
as
a
race
the
indians
are
no
longer
hostile
but
may
be
considered
as
submissive
to
the
control
of
the
government
few
of
them
only
are
troublesome
except
the
fragments
of
several
bands
all
are
now
gathered
upon
reservations
it
is
no
longer
possible
for
them
to
subsist
by
the
chase
and
the
spontaneous
productions
of
the
earth
with
an
abundance
of
land
if
furnished
with
the
means
and
implements
for
profitable
husbandry
their
life
of
entire
dependence
upon
government
rations
from
day
to
day
is
no
longer
defensible
their
inclination
long
fostered
by
a
defective
system
of
control
is
to
cling
to
the
habits
and
customs
of
their
ancestors
and
struggle
with
persistence
against
the
change
of
life
which
their
altered
circumstances
press
upon
them
but
barbarism
and
civilization
can
not
live
together
it
is
impossible
that
such
incongruous
conditions
should
coexist
on
the
same
soil
they
are
a
portion
of
our
people
are
under
the
authority
of
our
government
and
have
a
peculiar
claim
upon
and
are
entitled
to
the
fostering
care
and
protection
of
the
nation
the
government
can
not
relieve
itself
of
this
responsibility
until
they
are
so
far
trained
and
civilized
as
to
be
able
wholly
to
manage
and
care
for
themselves
the
paths
in
which
they
should
walk
must
be
clearly
marked
out
for
them
and
they
must
be
led
or
guided
until
they
are
familiar
with
the
way
and
competent
to
assume
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
our
citizenship
progress
in
this
great
work
will
continue
only
at
the
present
slow
pace
and
at
great
expense
unless
the
system
and
methods
of
management
are
improved
to
meet
the
changed
conditions
and
urgent
demands
of
the
service
the
agents
having
general
charge
and
supervision
in
many
cases
of
more
than
indians
scattered
over
large
reservations
and
burdened
with
the
details
of
accountability
for
funds
and
supplies
have
time
to
look
after
the
industrial
training
and
improvement
of
a
few
indians
only
the
many
are
neglected
and
remain
idle
and
dependent
conditions
not
favorable
for
progress
and
civilization
the
compensation
allowed
these
agents
and
the
conditions
of
the
service
are
not
calculated
to
secure
for
the
work
men
who
are
fitted
by
ability
and
skill
to
properly
plan
and
intelligently
direct
the
methods
best
adapted
to
produce
the
most
speedy
results
and
permanent
benefits
hence
the
necessity
for
a
supplemental
agency
or
system
directed
to
the
end
of
promoting
the
general
and
more
rapid
transition
of
the
tribes
from
habits
and
customs
of
barbarism
to
the
ways
of
civilization
with
an
anxious
desire
to
devise
some
plan
of
operation
by
which
to
secure
the
welfare
of
the
indians
and
to
relieve
the
treasury
as
far
as
possible
from
the
support
of
an
idle
and
dependent
population
i
recommended
in
my
previous
annual
message
the
passage
of
a
law
authorizing
the
appointment
of
a
commission
as
an
instrumentality
auxiliary
to
those
already
established
for
the
care
of
the
indians
it
was
designed
that
this
commission
should
be
composed
of
six
intelligent
and
capable
personsthree
to
be
detailed
from
the
armyhaving
practical
ideas
upon
the
subject
of
the
treatment
of
indians
and
interested
in
their
welfare
and
that
it
should
be
charged
under
the
direction
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
with
the
management
of
such
matters
of
detail
as
can
not
with
the
present
organization
be
properly
and
successfully
conducted
and
which
present
different
phases
as
the
indians
themselves
differ
in
their
progress
needs
disposition
and
capacity
for
improvement
or
immediate
selfsupport
by
the
aid
of
such
a
commission
much
unwise
and
useless
expenditure
of
money
waste
of
materials
and
unavailing
efforts
might
be
avoided
and
it
is
hoped
that
this
or
some
measure
which
the
wisdom
of
congress
may
better
devise
to
supply
the
deficiency
of
the
present
system
may
receive
your
consideration
and
the
appropriate
legislation
be
provided
the
time
is
ripe
for
the
work
of
such
an
agency
there
is
less
opposition
to
the
education
and
training
of
the
indian
youth
as
shown
by
the
increased
attendance
upon
the
schools
and
there
is
a
yielding
tendency
for
the
individual
holding
of
lands
development
and
advancement
in
these
directions
are
essential
and
should
have
every
encouragement
as
the
rising
generation
are
taught
the
language
of
civilization
and
trained
in
habits
of
industry
they
should
assume
the
duties
privileges
and
responsibilities
of
citizenship
no
obstacle
should
hinder
the
location
and
settlement
of
any
indian
willing
to
take
land
in
severalty
on
the
contrary
the
inclination
to
do
so
should
be
stimulated
at
all
times
when
proper
and
expedient
but
there
is
no
authority
of
law
for
making
allotments
on
some
of
the
reservations
and
on
others
the
allotments
provided
for
are
so
small
that
the
indians
though
ready
and
desiring
to
settle
down
are
not
willing
to
accept
such
small
areas
when
their
reservations
contain
ample
lands
to
afford
them
homesteads
of
sufficient
size
to
meet
their
present
and
future
needs
these
inequalities
of
existing
special
laws
and
treaties
should
be
corrected
and
some
general
legislation
on
the
subject
should
be
provided
so
that
the
more
progressive
members
of
the
different
tribes
may
be
settled
upon
homesteads
and
by
their
example
lead
others
to
follow
breaking
away
from
tribal
customs
and
substituting
therefor
the
love
of
home
the
interest
of
the
family
and
the
rule
of
the
state
the
indian
character
and
nature
are
such
that
they
are
not
easily
led
while
brooding
over
unadjusted
wrongs
this
is
especially
so
regarding
their
lands
matters
arising
from
the
construction
and
operation
of
railroads
across
some
of
the
reservations
and
claims
of
title
and
right
of
occupancy
set
up
by
white
persons
to
some
of
the
best
land
within
other
reservations
require
legislation
for
their
final
adjustment
the
settlement
of
these
matters
will
remove
many
embarrassments
to
progress
in
the
work
of
leading
the
indians
to
the
adoption
of
our
institutions
and
bringing
them
under
the
operation
the
influence
and
the
protection
of
the
universal
laws
of
our
country
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
looking
to
the
better
protection
of
public
lands
and
of
the
public
surveys
the
preservation
of
national
forests
the
adjudication
of
grants
to
states
and
corporations
and
of
private
land
claims
and
the
increased
efficiency
of
the
publicland
service
are
commended
to
the
attention
of
congress
to
secure
the
widest
distribution
of
public
lands
in
limited
quantities
among
settlers
for
residence
and
cultivation
and
thus
make
the
greatest
number
of
individual
homes
was
the
primary
object
of
the
publicland
legislation
in
the
early
days
of
the
republic
this
system
was
a
simple
one
it
commenced
with
an
admirable
scheme
of
public
surveys
by
which
the
humblest
citizen
could
identify
the
tract
upon
which
he
wished
to
establish
his
home
the
price
of
lands
was
placed
within
the
reach
of
all
the
enterprising
industrious
and
honest
pioneer
citizens
of
the
country
it
was
soon
however
found
that
the
object
of
the
laws
was
perverted
under
the
system
of
cash
sales
from
a
distribution
of
land
among
the
people
to
an
accumulation
of
land
capital
by
wealthy
and
speculative
persons
to
check
this
tendency
a
preference
right
of
purchase
was
given
to
settlers
on
the
land
a
plan
which
culminated
in
the
general
preemption
act
of
the
foundation
of
this
system
was
actual
residence
and
cultivation
twenty
years
later
the
homestead
law
was
devised
to
more
surely
place
actual
homes
in
the
possession
of
actual
cultivators
of
the
soil
the
land
was
given
without
price
the
sole
conditions
being
residence
improvement
and
cultivation
other
laws
have
followed
each
designed
to
encourage
the
acquirement
and
use
of
land
in
limited
individual
quantities
but
in
later
years
these
laws
through
vicious
administrative
methods
and
under
changed
conditions
of
communication
and
transportation
have
been
so
evaded
and
violated
that
their
beneficent
purpose
is
threatened
with
entire
defeat
the
methods
of
such
evasions
and
violations
are
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
the
rapid
appropriation
of
our
public
lands
without
bona
fide
settlements
or
cultivation
and
not
only
without
intention
of
residence
but
for
the
purpose
of
their
aggregation
in
large
holdings
in
many
cases
in
the
hands
of
foreigners
invites
the
serious
and
immediate
attention
of
the
congress
the
energies
of
the
land
department
have
been
devoted
during
the
present
administration
to
remedy
defects
and
correct
abuses
in
the
publicland
service
the
results
of
these
efforts
are
so
largely
in
the
nature
of
reforms
in
the
processes
and
methods
of
our
land
system
as
to
prevent
adequate
estimate
but
it
appears
by
a
compilation
from
the
reports
of
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
that
the
immediate
effect
in
leading
cases
which
have
come
to
a
final
termination
has
been
the
restoration
to
the
mass
of
public
lands
of
acres
that
acres
are
embraced
in
investigations
now
pending
before
the
department
or
the
courts
and
that
the
action
of
congress
has
been
asked
to
effect
the
restoration
of
acres
additional
besides
which
acres
have
been
withheld
from
reservation
and
the
rights
of
entry
thereon
maintained
i
recommend
the
repeal
of
the
preemption
and
timberculture
acts
and
that
the
homestead
laws
be
so
amended
as
to
better
secure
compliance
with
their
requirements
of
residence
improvement
and
cultivation
for
the
period
of
five
years
from
date
of
entry
without
commutation
or
provision
for
speculative
relinquishment
i
also
recommend
the
repeal
of
the
desertland
laws
unless
it
shall
be
the
pleasure
of
the
congress
to
so
amend
these
laws
as
to
render
them
less
liable
to
abuses
as
the
chief
motive
for
an
evasion
of
th
e
laws
and
the
principal
cause
of
their
result
in
land
accumulation
instead
of
land
distribution
is
the
facility
with
which
transfers
are
made
of
the
right
intended
to
be
secured
to
settlers
it
may
be
deemed
advisable
to
provide
by
legislation
some
guards
and
checks
upon
the
alienation
of
homestead
rights
and
lands
covered
thereby
until
patents
issue
last
year
an
executive
proclamation
was
issued
directing
the
removal
of
fences
which
inclosed
the
public
domain
many
of
these
have
been
removed
in
obedience
to
such
order
but
much
of
the
public
land
still
remains
within
the
lines
of
these
unlawful
fences
the
ingenious
methods
resorted
to
in
order
to
continue
these
trespasses
and
the
hardihood
of
the
pretenses
by
which
in
some
cases
such
inclosures
are
justified
are
fully
detailed
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
removal
of
the
fences
still
remaining
which
inclose
public
lands
will
be
enforced
with
all
the
authority
and
means
with
which
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
or
shall
be
invested
by
the
congress
for
that
purpose
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
pensions
contains
a
detailed
and
most
satisfactory
exhibit
of
the
operations
of
the
pension
bureau
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
amount
of
work
done
was
the
largest
in
any
year
since
the
organization
of
the
bureau
and
it
has
been
done
at
less
cost
than
during
the
previous
year
in
every
division
on
the
th
day
of
june
there
were
pensioners
on
the
rolls
of
the
bureau
since
there
have
been
applications
for
pensions
filed
of
which
were
based
upon
service
in
the
war
of
there
were
of
these
applications
allowed
including
to
the
soldiers
of
and
their
widows
the
total
amount
paid
for
pensions
since
is
the
number
of
new
pensions
allowed
during
the
year
ended
june
is
a
larger
number
than
has
been
allowed
in
any
year
save
one
since
the
names
of
pensioners
which
had
been
previously
dropped
from
the
rolls
were
restored
during
the
year
and
after
deducting
those
dropped
within
the
same
time
for
various
causes
a
net
increase
remains
for
the
year
of
names
from
january
to
december
private
pension
acts
had
been
passed
since
the
lastmentioned
date
and
during
the
last
session
of
the
congress
such
acts
became
laws
it
seems
to
me
that
no
one
can
examine
our
pension
establishment
and
its
operations
without
being
convinced
that
through
its
instrumentality
justice
can
be
very
nearly
done
to
all
who
are
entitled
under
present
laws
to
the
pension
bounty
of
the
government
but
it
is
undeniable
that
cases
exist
well
entitled
to
relief
in
which
the
pension
bureau
is
powerless
to
aid
the
really
worthy
cases
of
this
class
are
such
as
only
lack
by
misfortune
the
kind
or
quantity
of
proof
which
the
law
and
regulations
of
the
bureau
require
or
which
though
their
merit
is
apparent
for
some
other
reason
can
not
be
justly
dealt
with
through
general
laws
these
conditions
fully
justify
application
to
the
congress
and
special
enactments
but
resort
to
the
congress
for
a
special
pension
act
to
overrule
the
deliberate
and
careful
determination
of
the
pension
bureau
on
the
merits
or
to
secure
favorable
action
when
it
could
not
be
expected
under
the
most
liberal
execution
of
general
laws
it
must
be
admitted
opens
the
door
to
the
allowance
of
questionable
claims
and
presents
to
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
the
government
applications
concededly
not
within
the
law
and
plainly
devoid
of
merit
but
so
surrounded
by
sentiment
and
patriotic
feeling
that
they
are
hard
to
resist
i
suppose
it
will
not
be
denied
that
many
claims
for
pension
are
made
without
merit
and
that
many
have
been
allowed
upon
fraudulent
representations
this
has
been
declared
from
the
pension
bureau
not
only
in
this
but
in
prior
administrations
the
usefulness
and
the
justice
of
any
system
for
the
distribution
of
pensions
depend
upon
the
equality
and
uniformity
of
its
operation
it
will
be
seen
from
the
report
of
the
commissioner
that
there
are
now
paid
by
the
government
different
rates
of
pension
he
estimates
from
the
best
information
he
can
obtain
that
of
those
who
have
served
in
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
are
now
supported
in
whole
or
in
part
from
public
funds
or
by
organized
charities
exclusive
of
those
in
soldiers
homes
under
the
direction
and
control
of
the
government
only
per
cent
of
these
are
pensioners
while
of
the
entire
number
of
men
furnished
for
the
late
war
something
like
per
cent
including
their
widows
and
relatives
have
been
or
now
are
in
receipt
of
pensions
the
american
people
with
a
patriotic
and
grateful
regard
for
our
exsoldiers
too
broad
and
too
sacred
to
be
monopolized
by
any
special
advocates
are
not
only
willing
but
anxious
that
equal
and
exact
justice
should
be
done
to
all
honest
claimants
for
pensions
in
their
sight
the
friendless
and
destitute
soldier
dependent
on
public
charity
if
otherwise
entitled
has
precisely
the
same
right
to
share
in
the
provision
made
for
those
who
fought
their
countrys
battles
as
those
better
able
through
friends
and
influence
to
push
their
claims
every
pension
that
is
granted
under
our
present
plan
upon
any
other
grounds
than
actual
service
and
injury
or
disease
incurred
in
such
service
and
every
instance
of
the
many
in
which
pensions
are
increased
on
other
grounds
than
the
merits
of
the
claim
work
an
injustice
to
the
brave
and
crippled
but
poor
and
friendless
soldier
who
is
entirely
neglected
or
who
must
be
content
with
the
smallest
sum
allowed
under
general
laws
there
are
far
too
many
neighborhoods
in
which
are
found
glaring
cases
of
inequality
of
treatment
in
the
matter
of
pensions
and
they
are
largely
due
to
a
yielding
in
the
pension
bureau
to
importunity
on
the
part
of
those
other
than
the
pensioner
who
are
especially
interested
or
they
arise
from
special
acts
passed
for
the
benefit
of
individuals
the
men
who
fought
side
by
side
should
stand
side
by
side
when
they
participate
in
a
grateful
nations
kind
remembrance
every
consideration
of
fairness
and
justice
to
our
exsoldiers
and
the
protection
of
the
patriotic
instinct
of
our
citizens
from
perversion
and
violation
point
to
the
adoption
of
a
pension
system
broad
and
comprehensive
enough
to
cover
every
contingency
and
which
shall
make
unnecessary
an
objectionable
volume
of
special
legislation
as
long
as
we
adhere
to
the
principle
of
granting
pensions
for
service
and
disability
as
the
result
of
the
service
the
allowance
of
pensions
should
be
restricted
to
cases
presenting
these
features
every
patriotic
heart
responds
to
a
tender
consideration
for
those
who
having
served
their
country
long
and
well
are
reduced
to
destitution
and
dependence
not
as
an
incident
of
their
service
but
with
advancing
age
or
through
sickness
or
misfortune
we
are
all
tempted
by
the
contemplation
of
such
a
condition
to
supply
relief
and
are
often
impatient
of
the
limitations
of
public
duty
yielding
to
no
one
in
the
desire
to
indulge
this
feeling
of
consideration
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
the
conviction
that
if
these
exsoldiers
are
to
be
relieved
they
and
their
cause
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
an
enactment
under
which
relief
may
be
claimed
as
a
right
and
that
such
relief
should
be
granted
under
the
sanction
of
law
not
in
evasion
of
it
nor
should
such
worthy
objects
of
care
all
equally
entitled
be
remitted
to
the
unequal
operation
of
sympathy
or
the
tender
mercies
of
social
and
political
influence
with
their
unjust
discriminations
the
discharged
soldiers
and
sailors
of
the
country
are
our
fellowcitizens
and
interested
with
us
in
the
passage
and
faithful
execution
of
wholesome
laws
they
can
not
be
swerved
from
their
duty
of
citizenship
by
artful
appeals
to
their
spirit
of
brotherhood
born
of
common
peril
and
suffering
nor
will
they
exact
as
a
test
of
devotion
to
their
welfare
a
willingness
to
neglect
public
duty
in
their
behalf
on
the
th
of
march
the
current
business
of
the
patent
office
was
on
an
average
five
and
a
half
months
in
arrears
and
in
several
divisions
more
than
twelve
months
behind
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
such
current
work
was
but
three
months
in
arrears
and
it
is
asserted
and
believed
that
in
the
next
few
months
the
delay
in
obtaining
an
examination
of
an
application
for
a
patent
will
be
but
nominal
the
number
of
applications
for
patents
during
the
last
fiscal
year
including
reissues
designs
trademarks
and
labels
equals
which
is
considerably
in
excess
of
the
number
received
during
any
preceding
year
the
receipts
of
the
patent
office
during
the
year
aggregate
enabling
the
office
to
turn
into
the
treasury
a
surplus
revenue
over
and
above
all
expenditures
of
about
the
number
of
patents
granted
during
the
last
fiscal
year
including
reissues
trademarks
designs
and
labels
was
a
number
also
quite
largely
in
excess
of
that
of
any
preceding
year
the
report
of
the
commissioner
shows
the
office
to
be
in
a
prosperous
condition
and
constantly
increasing
in
its
business
no
increase
of
force
is
asked
for
the
amount
estimated
for

the
amount

is
the
secretary
of
the
interior
suggests
a
change
in
the
plan
for
the
payment
of
the
indebtedness
of
the
pacific
subsidized
roads
to
the
government
his
suggestion
has
the
unanimous
indorsement
of
the
persons
selected
by
the
government
to
act
as
directors
of
these
roads
and
protect
the
interests
of
the
united
states
in
the
board
of
direction
in
considering
the
plan
proposed
the
sole
matters
which
should
be
taken
into
account
in
my
opinion
are
the
situation
of
the
government
as
a
creditor
and
the
surest
way
to
secure
the
payment
of
the
principal
and
interest
of
its
debt
by
a
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
it
has
been
adjudged
that
the
laws
of
the
several
states
are
inoperative
to
regulate
rates
of
transportation
upon
railroads
if
such
regulation
interferes
with
the
rate
of
carriage
from
one
state
into
another
this
important
field
of
control
and
regulation
having
been
thus
left
entirely
unoccupied
the
expediency
of
federal
action

upon
the
subject
is
worthy
of
consideration
the
relations
of
labor
to
capital
and
of
laboring
men
to
their
employers
are
of
the
utmost
concern
to
every
patriotic
citizen
when
these
are
strained
and
distorted
unjustifiable
claims
are
apt
to
be
insisted
upon
by
both
interests
and
in
the
controversy
which
results
the
welfare
of
all
and
the
prosperity
of
the
country
are
jeopardized
any
intervention
of
the
general
government
within
the
limits
of
its
constitutional
authority
to
avert
such
a
condition
should
be
willingly
accorded
in
a
special
message
transmitted
to
the
congress
at
its
last
session
i
suggested
the
enlargement
of
our
present
labor
bureau
and
adding
to
its
present
functions
the
power
of
arbitration
in
cases
where
differences
arise
between
employer
and
employed
when
these
differences
reach
such
a
stage
as
to
result
in
the
interruption
of
commerce
between
the
states
the
application
of
this
remedy
by
the
general
government
might
be
regarded
as
entirely
within
its
constitutional
powers
and
i
think
we
might
reasonably
hope
that
such
arbitrators
if
carefully
selected
and
if
entitled
to
the
confidence
of
the
parties
to
be
affected
would
be
voluntarily
called
to
the
settlement
of
controversies
of
less
extent
and
not
necessarily
within
the
domain
of
federal
regulation
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
this
suggestion
is
worthy
the
attention
of
the
congress
but
after
all
has
been
done
by
the
passage
of
laws
either
federal
or
state
to
relieve
a
situation
full
of
solicitude
much
more
remains
to
be
accomplished
by
the
reinstatement
and
cultivation
of
a
true
american
sentiment
which
recognizes
the
equality
of
american
citizenship
this
in
the
light
of
our
traditions
and
in
loyalty
to
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
would
teach
that
a
hearty
cooperation
on
the
part
of
all
interests
is
the
surest
path
to
national
greatness
and
the
happiness
of
all
our
people
that
capital
should
in
recognition
of
the
brotherhood
of
our
citizenship
and
in
a
spirit
of
american
fairness
generously
accord
to
labor
its
just
compensation
and
consideration
and
that
contented
labor
is
capitals
best
protection
and
faithful
ally
it
would
teach
too
that
the
diverse
situations
of
our
people
are
inseparable
from
our
civilization
that
every
citizen
should
in
his
sphere
be
a
contributor
to
the
general
good
that
capital
does
not
necessarily
tend
to
the
oppression
of
labor
and
that
violent
disturbances
and
disorders
alienate
from
their
promoters
true
american
sympathy
and
kindly
feeling
the
department
of
agriculture
representing
the
oldest
and
largest
of
our
national
industries
is
subserving
well
the
purposes
of
its
organization
by
the
introduction
of
new
subjects
of
farming
enterprise
and
by
opening
new
sources
of
agricultural
wealth
and
the
dissemination
of
early
information
concerning
production
and
prices
it
has
contributed
largely
to
the
countrys
prosperity
through
this
agency
advanced
thought
and
investigation
touching
the
subjects
it
has
in
charge
should
among
other
things
be
practically
applied
to
the
home
production
at
a
low
cost
of
articles
of
food
which
are
now
imported
from
abroad
such
an
innovation
will
necessarily
of
course
in
the
beginning
be
within
the
domain
of
intelligent
experiment
and
the
subject
in
every
stage
should
receive
all
possible
encouragement
from
the
government
the
interests
of
millions
of
our
citizens
engaged
in
agriculture
are
involved
in
an
enlargement
and
improvement
of
the
results
of
their
labor
and
a
zealous
regard
for
their
welfare
should
be
a
willing
tribute
to
those
whose
productive
returns
are
a
main
source
of
our
progress
and
power
the
existence
of
pleuropneumonia
among
the
cattle
of
various
states
has
led
to
burdensome
and
in
some
cases
disastrous
restrictions
in
an
important
branch
of
our
commerce
threatening
to
affect
the
quantity
and
quality
of
our
food
supply
this
is
a
matter
of
such
importance
and
of
such
farreaching
consequences
that
i
hope
it
will
engage
the
serious
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
end
that
such
a
remedy
may
be
applied
as
the
limits
of
a
constitutional
delegation
of
power
to
the
general
government
will
permit
i
commend
to
the
consideration
of
the
congress
the
report
of
the
commissioner
and
his
suggestions
concerning
the
interest
intrusted
to
his
care
the
continued
operation
of
the
law
relating
to
our
civil
service
has
added
the
most
convincing
proofs
of
its
necessity
and
usefulness
it
is
a
fact
worthy
of
note
that
every
public
officer
who
has
a
just
idea
of
his
duty
to
the
people
testifies
to
the
value
of
this
reform
its
staunchest
friends
are
found
among
those
who
understand
it
best
and
its
warmest
supporters
are
those
who
are
restrained
and
protected
by
its
requirements
the
meaning
of
such
restraint
and
protection
is
not
appreciated
by
those
who
want
places
under
the
government
regardless
of
merit
and
efficiency
nor
by
those
who
insist
that
the
selection
of
such
places
should
rest
upon
a
proper
credential
showing
active
partisan
work
they
mean
to
public
officers
if
not
their
lives
the
only
opportunity
afforded
them
to
attend
to
public
business
and
they
mean
to
the
good
people
of
the
country
the
better
performance
of
the
work
of
their
government
it
is
exceedingly
strange
that
the
scope
and
nature
of
this
reform
are
so
little
understood
and
that
so
many
things
not
included
within
its
plan
are
called
by
its
name
when
cavil
yields
more
fully
to
examination
the
system
will
have
large
additions
to
the
number
of
its
friends
our
civilservice
reform
may
be
imperfect
in
some
of
its
details
it
may
be
misunderstood
and
opposed
it
may
not
always
be
faithfully
applied
its
designs
may
sometimes
miscarry
through
mistake
or
willful
intent
it
may
sometimes
tremble
under
the
assaults
of
its
enemies
or
languish
under
the
misguided
zeal
of
impracticable
friends
but
if
the
people
of
this
country
ever
submit
to
the
banishment
of
its
underlying
principle
from
the
operation
of
their
government
they
will
abandon
the
surest
guaranty
of
the
safety
and
success
of
american
institutions
i
invoke
for
this
reform
the
cheerful
and
ungrudging
support
of
the
congress
i
renew
my
recommendation
made
last
year
that
the
salaries
of
the
commissioners
be
made
equal
to
other
officers
of
the
government
having
like
duties
and
responsibilities
and
i
hope
that
such
reasonable
appropriations
may
be
made
as
will
enable
them
to
increase
the
usefulness
of
the
cause
they
have
in
charge
i
desire
to
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
a
plain
duty
which
the
government
owes
to
the
depositors
in
the
freedmans
savings
and
trust
company
this
company
was
chartered
by
the
congress
for
the
benefit
of
the
most
illiterate
and
humble
of
our
people
and
with
the
intention
of
encouraging
in
them
industry
and
thrift
most
of
its
branches
were
presided
over
by
officers
holding
the
commissions
and
clothed
in
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
these
and
other
circumstances
reasonably
i
think
led
these
simple
people
to
suppose
that
the
invitation
to
deposit
their
hardearned
savings
in
this
institution
implied
an
undertaking
on
the
part
of
their
government
that
their
money
should
be
safely
kept
for
them
when
this
company
failed
it
was
liable
in
the
sum
of
to
depositors
dividends
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
per
cent
have
been
declared
and
the
sum
called
for
and
paid
of
such
dividends
seems
to
be
this
sum
deducted
from
the
entire
amount
of
deposits
leaves
still
unpaid
past
experience
has
shown
that
quite
a
large
part
of
this
sum
will
not
be
called
for
there
are
assets
still
on
hand
amounting
to
the
estimated
sum
of
i
think
the
remaining
per
cent
of
such
of
these
deposits
as
have
claimants
should
be
paid
by
the
government
upon
principles
of
equity
and
fairness
the
report
of
the
commissioner
soon
to
be
laid
before
congress
will
give
more
satisfactory
details
on
this
subject
the
control
of
the
affairs
of
the
district
of
columbia
having
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
purely
executive
officers
while
the
congress
still
retains
all
legislative
authority
relating
to
its
government
it
becomes
my
duty
to
make
known
the
most
pressing
needs
of
the
district
and
recommend
their
consideration
the
laws
of
the
district
appear
to
be
in
an
uncertain
and
unsatisfactory
condition
and
their
codification
or
revision
is
much
needed
during
the
past
year
one
of
the
bridges
leading
from
the
district
to
the
state
of
virginia
became
unfit
for
use
and
travel
upon
it
was
forbidden
this
leads
me
to
suggest
that
the
improvement
of
all
the
bridges
crossing
the
potomac
and
its
branches
from
the
city
of
washington
is
worthy
the
attention
of
congress
the
commissioners
of
the
district
represent
that
the
laws
regulating
the
sale
of
liquor
and
granting
licenses
therefor
should
be
at
once
amended
and
that
legislation
is
needed
to
consolidate
define
and
enlarge
the
scope
and
powers
of
charitable
and
penal
institutions
within
the
district
i
suggest
that
the
commissioners
be
clothed
with
the
power
to
make
within
fixed
limitations
police
regulations
i
believe
this
power
granted
and
carefully
guarded
would
tend
to
subserve
the
good
order
of
the
municipality
it
seems
that
trouble
still
exists
growing
out
of
the
occupation
of
the
streets
and
avenues
by
certain
railroads
having
their
termini
in
the
city
it
is
very
important
that
such
laws
should
be
enacted
upon
this
subject
as
will
secure
to
the
railroads
all
the
facilities
they
require
for
the
transaction
of
their
business
and
at
the
same
time
protect
citizens
from
injury
to
their
persons
or
property
the
commissioners
again
complain
that
the
accommodations
afforded
them
for
the
necessary
offices
for
district
business
and
for
the
safekeeping
of
valuable
books
and
papers
are
entirely
insufficient
i
recommend
that
this
condition
of
affairs
be
remedied
by
the
congress
and
that
suitable
quarters
be
furnished
for
the
needs
of
the
district
government
in
conclusion
i
earnestly
invoke
such
wise
action
on
the
part
of
the
peoples
legislators
as
will
subserve
the
public
good
and
demonstrate
during
the
remaining
days
of
the
congress
as
at
present
organized
its
ability
and
inclin
ation
to
so
meet
the
peoples
needs
that
it
shall
be
gratefully
remembered
by
an
expectant
constituency

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
your
assembling
is
clouded
by
a
sense
of
public
bereavement
caused
by
the
recent
and
sudden
death
of
thomas
a
hendricks
vicepresident
of
the
united
states
his
distinguished
public
services
his
complete
integrity
and
devotion
to
every
duty
and
his
personal
virtues
will
find
honorable
record
in
his
countrys
history
ample
and
repeated
proofs
of
the
esteem
and
confidence
in
which
he
was
held
by
his
fellowcountrymen
were
manifested
by
his
election
to
offices
of
the
most
important
trust
and
highest
dignity
and
at
length
full
of
years
and
honors
he
has
been
laid
at
rest
amid
universal
sorrow
and
benediction
the
constitution
which
requires
those
chosen
to
legislate
for
the
people
to
annually
meet
in
the
discharge
of
their
solemn
trust
also
requires
the
president
to
give
to
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommend
to
their
consideration
such
measures
as
he
shall
deem
necessary
and
expedient
at
the
threshold
of
a
compliance
with
these
constitutional
directions
it
is
well
for
us
to
bear
in
mind
that
our
usefulness
to
the
peoples
interests
will
be
promoted
by
a
constant
appreciation
of
the
scope
and
character
of
our
respective
duties
as
they
relate
to
federal
legislation
while
the
executive
may
recommend
such
measures
as
he
shall
deem
expedient
the
responsibility
for
legislative
action
must
and
should
rest
upon
those
selected
by
the
people
to
make
their
laws
contemplation
of
the
grave
and
responsible
functions
assigned
to
the
respective
branches
of
the
government
under
the
constitution
will
disclose
the
partitions
of
power
between
our
respective
departments
and
their
necessary
independence
and
also
the
need
for
the
exercise
of
all
the
power
intrusted
to
each
in
that
spirit
of
comity
and
cooperation
which
is
essential
to
the
proper
fulfillment
of
the
patriotic
obligations
which
rest
upon
us
as
faithful
servants
of
the
people
the
jealous
watchfulness
of
our
constituencies
great
and
small
supplements
their
suffrages
and
before
the
tribunal
they
establish
every
public
servant
should
be
judged
it
is
gratifying
to
announce
that
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
all
foreign
powers
continue
to
be
friendly
our
position
after
nearly
a
century
of
successful
constitutional
government
maintenance
of
good
faith
in
all
our
engagements
the
avoidance
of
complications
with
other
nations
and
our
consistent
and
amicable
attitude
toward
the
strong
and
weak
alike
furnish
proof
of
a
political
disposition
which
renders
professions
of
good
will
unnecessary
there
are
no
questions
of
difficulty
pending
with
any
foreign
government
the
argentine
government
has
revived
the
long
dormant
question
of
the
falkland
islands
by
claiming
from
the
united
states
indemnity
for
their
loss
attributed
to
the
action
of
the
commander
of
the
sloop
of
war
lexington
in
breaking
up
a
piratical
colony
on
those
islands
in
and
their
subsequent
occupation
by
great
britain
in
view
of
the
ample
justification
for
the
act
of
the
lexington
and
the
derelict
condition
of
the
islands
before
and
after
their
alleged
occupation
by
argentine
colonists
this
government
considers
the
claim
as
wholly
groundless
question
has
arisen
with
the
government
of
austriahungary
touching
the
representation
of
the
united
states
at
vienna
having
under
my
constitutional
prerogative
appointed
an
estimable
citizen
of
unimpeached
probity
and
competence
as
minister
at
that
court
the
government
of
austriahungary
invited
this
government
to
take
cognizance
of
certain
exceptions
based
upon
allegations
against
the
personal
acceptability
of
mr
keiley
the
appointed
envoy
asking
that
in
view
thereof
the
appointment
should
be
withdrawn
the
reasons
advanced
were
such
as
could
not
be
acquiesced
in
without
violation
of
my
oath
of
office
and
the
precepts
of
the
constitution
since
they
necessarily
involved
a
limitation
in
favor
of
a
foreign
government
upon
the
right
of
selection
by
the
executive
and
required
such
an
application
of
a
religious
test
as
a
qualification
for
office
under
the
united
states
as
would
have
resulted
in
the
practical
disfranchisement
of
a
large
class
of
our
citizens
and
the
abandonment
of
a
vital
principle
in
our
government
the
austrohungarian
government
finally
decided
not
to
receive
mr
keiley
as
the
envoy
of
the
united
states
and
that
gentleman
has
since
resigned
his
commission
leaving
the
post
vacant
i
have
made
no
new
nomination
and
the
interests
of
this
government
at
vienna
are
now
in
the
care
of

by
the
attempt
of
guatemala
to
consolidate
the
several
states
into
a
single
government
in
these
contests
between
our
neighboring
states
the
united

forebore
to
interfere
actively

lent
the
aid
of
their
friendly
offices
in
deprecation
of
war
and
to
promote
peace
and
concord
among
the
belligerents
and
by
such
counsel
contributed
importantly
to
the
restoration
of
tranquillity
in
that
locality
emergencies
growing
out
of
civil
war
in
the
united
states
of
colombia
demanded
of
the
government
at
the
beginning
of
this
administration
the
employment
of
armed
forces
to
fulfill
its
guaranties
under
the
thirtyfifth
article
of
the
treaty
of
in
order
to
keep
the
transit
open
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
desirous
of
exercising
only
the
powers
expressly
reserved
to
us
by
the
treaty
and
mindful
of
the
rights
of
colombia
the
forces
sent
to
the
isthmus
were
instructed
to
confine
their
action
to
positively
and
efficaciously
preventing
the
transit
and
its
accessories
from
being
interrupted
or
embarrassed
the
execution
of
this
delicate
and
responsible
task
necessarily
involved
police
control
where
the
local
authority
was
temporarily
powerless
but
always
in
aid
of
the
sovereignty
of
colombia
the
prompt
and
successful
fulfillment
of
its
duty
by
this
government
was
highly
appreciated
by
the
government
of
colombia
and
has
been
followed
by
expressions
of
its
satisfaction
high
praise
is
due
to
the
officers
and
men
engaged
in
this
service
the
restoration
of
peace
on
the
isthmus
by
the
reestablishment
of
the
constituted
government
there
being
thus
accomplished
the
forces
of
the
united
states
were
withdrawn
pending
these
occurrences
a
question
of
much
importance
was
presented
by
decrees
of
the
colombian
government
proclaiming
the
closure
of
certain
ports
then
in
the
hands
of
insurgents
and
declaring
vessels
held
by
the
revolutionists
to
be
piratical
and
liable
to
capture
by
any
power
to
neither
of
these
propositions
could
the
united
states
assent
an
effective
closure
of
ports
not
in
the
possession
of
the
government
but
held
by
hostile
partisans
could
not
be
recognized
neither
could
the
vessels
of
insurgents
against
the
legitimate
sovereignty
be
deemed
hostes
humani
generis
within
the
precepts
of
international
law
whatever
might
be
the
definition
and
penalty
of
their
acts
under
the
municipal
law
of
the
state
against
whose
authority
they
were
in
revolt
the
denial
by
this
government
of
the
colombian
propositions
did
not
however
imply
the
admission
of
a
belligerent
status
on
the
part
of
the
insurgents
the
colombian
government
has
expressed
its
willingness
to
negotiate
conventions
for
the
adjustment
by
arbitration
of
claims
by
foreign
citizens
arising
out
of
the
destruction
of
the
city
of
aspinwall
by
the
insurrectionary
forces
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
a
practicable
transit
for
ships
across
the
strip
of
land
separating
the
atlantic
from
the
pacific
has
been
repeatedly
manifested
during
the
last
half
century
my
immediate
predecessor
caused
to
be
negotiated
with
nicaragua
a
treaty
for
the
construction
by
and
at
the
sole
cost
of
the
united
states
of
a
canal
through
nicaraguan
territory
and
laid
it
before
the
senate
pending
the
action
of
that
body
thereon
i
withdrew
the
treaty
for
reexamination
attentive
consideration
of
its
provisions
leads
me
to
withhold
it
from
resubmission
to
the
senate
maintaining
as
i
do
the
tenets
of
a
line
of
precedents
from
washingtons
day
which
proscribe
entangling
alliances
with
foreign
states
i
do
not
favor
a
policy
of
acquisition
of
new
and
distant
territory
or
the
incorporation
of
remote
interests
with
our
own
the
laws
of
progress
are
vital
and
organic
and
we
must
be
conscious
of
that
irresistible
tide
of
commercial
expansion
which
as
the
concomitant
of
our
active
civilization
day
by
day
is
being
urged
onward
by
those
increasing
facilities
of
production
transportation
and
communication
to
which
steam
and
electricity
have
given
birth
but
our
duty
in
the
present
instructs
us
to
address
ourselves
mainly
to
the
development
of
the
vast
resources
of
the
great
area
committed
to
our
charge
and
to
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
of
peace
within
our
own
borders
though
jealously
alert
in
preventing
the
american
hemisphere
from
being
involved
in
the
political
problems
and
complications
of
distant
governments
therefore
i
am
unable
to
recommend
propositions
involving
paramount
privileges
of
ownership
or
right
outside
of
our
own
territory
when
coupled
with
absolute
and
unlimited
engagements
to
defend
the
territorial
integrity
of
the
state
where
such
interests
lie
while
the
general
project
of
connecting
the
two
oceans
by
means
of
a
canal
is
to
be
encouraged
i
am
of
opinion
that
any
scheme
to
that
end
to
be
considered
with
favor
should
be
free
from
the
features
alluded
to
the
tehuantepec
route
is
declared
by
engineers
of
the
highest
repute
and
by
competent
scientists
to
afford
an
entirely
practicable
transit
for
vessels
and
cargoes
by
means
of
a
ship
railway
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
the
obvious
advantages
of
such
a
route
if
feasible
over
others
more
remote
from
the
axial
lines
of
traffic
between
europe
and
the
pacific
and
particularly
between
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
western
coast
of
north
and
south
america
are
deserving
of
consideration
whatever
highway
may
be
constructed
across
the
barrier
dividing
the
two
greatest
maritime
areas
of
the
world
must
be
for
the
worlds
benefita
trust
for
mankind
to
be
removed

from
the
chance
of
domination
by
any
single
power
nor
become
a
point
of
invitation
for
hostilities
or
a
prize
for
warlike
ambition
an
engagement
combining
the
construction
ownership
and
operation
of
such
a
work
by
this
government
with
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
for
its
protection
with
the
foreign
state
whose
responsibilities
and
rights
we
would
share
is
in
my
judgment
inconsistent
with
such
dedication
to
universal
and
neutral
use
and
would
moreover
entail
measures
for
its
realization
beyond
the
scope
of
our
national
polity
or
present
means
the
lapse
of
years
has
abundantly
confirmed
the
wisdom
and
foresight
of
those
earlier
administrations
which
long
before
the
conditions
of
maritime
intercourse
were
changed
and
enlarged
by
the
progress
of
the
age
proclaimed
the
vital
need
of
interoceanic
transit
across
the
american
isthmus
and
consecrated
it
in
advance
to
the
common
use
of
mankind
by
their
positive
declarations
and
through
the
formal
obligation
of
treaties
toward
such
realization
the
efforts
of
my
administration
will
be
applied
ever
bearing
in
mind
the
principles
on
which
it
must
rest
and
which
were
declared
in
no
uncertain
tones
by
mr
cass
who
while
secretary
of
state
in
announced
that
what
the
united
states
want
in
central
america
next
to
the
happiness
of
its
people
is
the
security
and
neutrality
of
the
interoceanic
routes
which
lead
through
it
the
construction
of
three
transcontinental
lines
of
railway
all
in
successful
operation
wholly
within
our
territory
and
uniting
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
oceans
has
been
accompanied
by
results
of
a
most
interesting
and
impressive
nature
and
has
created
new
conditions
not
in
the
routes
of
commerce
only
but
in
political
geography
which
powerfully
affect
our
relations
toward
and
necessarily
increase
our
interests
in
any
transisthmian
route
which
may
be
opened
and
employed
for
the
ends
of
peace
and
traffic
or
in
other
contingencies
for
uses
inimical
to
both
transportation
is
a
factor
in
the
cost
of
commodities
scarcely
second
to
that
of
their
production
and
weighs
as
heavily
upon
the
consumer
our
experience
already
has
proven
the
great
importance
of
having
the
competition
between
land
carriage
and
water
carriage
fully
developed
each
acting
as
a
protection
to
the
public
against
the
tendencies
to
monopoly
which
are
inherent
in
the
consolidation
of
wealth
and
power
in
the
hands
of
vast
corporations
these
suggestions
may
serve
to
emphasize
what
i
have
already
said
on
the
score
of
the
necessity
of
a
neutralization
of
any
interoceanic
transit
and
this
can
only
be
accomplished
by
making
the
uses
of
the
route
open
to
all
nations
and
subject
to
the
ambitions
and
warlike
necessities
of
none
the
drawings
and
report
of
a
recent
survey
of
the
nicaragua
canal
route
made
by

be
communicated
for
your
information
the
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
losses
by
reason
of
the
late
military
operations
of
chile
in
peru
and
bolivia
are
the
subject
of
negotiation
for
a
claims
convention
with
chile
providing
for
their
submission
to
arbitration
the
harmony
of
our
relations
with
china
is
fully
sustained
in
the
application
of
the
acts
lately
passed
to
execute
the
treaty
of
restrictive
of
the
immigration
of
chinese
laborers
into
the
united
states
individual
cases
of
hardship
have
occurred
beyond
the
power
of
the
executive
to
remedy
and
calling
for
judicial
determination
the
condition
of
the
chinese
question
in
the
western
states
and
territories
is
despite
this
restrictive
legislation
far
from
being
satisfactory
the
recent
outbreak
in
wyoming
territory
where
numbers
of
unoffending
chinamen
indisputably
within
the
protection
of
the
treaties
and
the
law
were
murdered
by
a
mob
and
the
still
more
recent
threatened
outbreak
of
the
same
character
in
washington
territory
are
fresh
in
the
minds
of
all
and
there
is
apprehension
lest
the
bitterness
of
feeling
against
the
mongolian
race
on
the
pacific
slope
may
find
vent
in
similar
lawless
demonstrations
all
the
power
of
this
government
should
be
exerted
to
maintain
the
amplest
good
faith
toward
china
in
the
treatment
of
these
men
and
the
inflexible
sternness
of
the
law
in
bringing
the
wrongdoers
to
justice
should
be
insisted
upon
every
effort
has
been
made
by
this
government
to
prevent
these
violent
outbreaks
and
to
aid
the
representatives
of
china
in
their
investigation
of
these
outrages
and
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
they
are
traceable
to
the
lawlessness
of
men
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
engaged
in
competition
with
chinese
laborers
race
prejudice
is
the
chief
factor
in
originating
these
disturbances
and
it
exists
in
a
large
part
of
our
domain
jeopardizing
our
domestic
peace
and
the
good
relationship
we
strive
to
maintain
with
china
the
admitted
right
of
a
government
to
prevent
the
influx
of
elements
hostile
to
its
internal
peace
and
security
may
not
be
questioned
even
where
there
is
no
treaty
stipulation
on
the
subject
that
the
exclusion
of
chinese
labor
is
demanded
in
other
countries
where
like
conditions
prevail
is
strongly
evidenced
in
the
dominion
of
canada
where
chinese
immigration
is
now
regulated
by
laws
more
exclusive
than
our
own
if
existing
laws
are
inadequate
to
compass
the
end
in
view
i
shall
be
prepared
to
give
earnest
consideration
to
any
further
remedial
measures
within
the
treaty
limits
which
the
wisdom
of
congress
may
devise
the
independent
state
of
the
kongo
has
been
organized
as
a
government
under
the
sovereignty
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
the
belgians
who
assumes
its
chief
magistracy
in
his
personal
character
only
without
making
the
new
state
a
dependency
of
belgium
it
is
fortunate
that
a
benighted
region
owing
all
it
has
of
quickening
civilization
to
the
beneficence
and
philanthropic
spirit
of
this
monarch
should
have
the
advantage
and
security
of
his
benevolent
supervision
the
action
taken
by
this
government
last
year
in
being
the
first
to
recognize
the
flag
of
the
international
association
of
the
kongo
has
been
followed
by
formal
recognition
of
the
new
nationality
which
succeeds
to
its
sovereign
powers
a
conference
of
delegates
of
the
principal
commercial
nations
was
held
at
berlin
last
winter
to
discuss
methods
whereby
the
kongo
basin
might
be
kept
open
to
the
worlds
trade
delegates
attended
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
on
the
understanding
that
their
part
should
be
merely
deliberative
without
imparting
to
the
results
any
binding
character
so
far
as
the
united
states
were
concerned
this
reserve
was
due
to
the
indisposition
of
this
government
to
share
in
any
disposal
by
an
international
congress
of
jurisdictional
questions
in
remote
foreign
territories
the
results
of
the
conference
were
embodied
in
a
formal
act
of
the
nature
of
an
international
convention
which
laid
down
certain
obligations
purporting
to
be
binding
on
the
signatories
subject
to
ratification
within
one
year
notwithstanding
the
reservation
under
which
the
delegates
of
the
united
states
attended
their
signatures
were
attached
to
the
general
act
in
the
same
manner
as
those
of
the
plenipotentiaries
of
other
governments
thus
making
the
united
states
appear
without
reserve
or
qualification
as
signatories
to
a
joint
international
engagement
imposing
on
the
signers
the
conservation
of
the
territorial
integrity
of
distant
regions
where
we
have
no
established
interests
or
control
this
government
does
not
however
regard
its
reservation
of
liberty
of
action
in
the
premises
as
at
all
impaired
and
holding
that
an
engagement
to
share
in
the
obligation
of
enforcing
neutrality
in
the
remote
valley
of
the
kongo
would
be
an
alliance
whose
responsibilities
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
assume
i
abstain
from
asking
the
sanction
of
the
senate
to
that
general
act
the
correspondence
will
be
laid
before
you
and
the
instructive
and
interesting
report
of
the
agent
sent
by
this
government
to
the
kongo
country
and
his
recommendations
for
the
establishment
of
commercial
agencies
on
the
african
coast
are
also
submitted
for
your
consideration
the
commission
appointed
by
my
predecessor
last
winter
to
visit
the
central
and
south
american
countries
and
report
on
the
methods
of
enlarging
the
commercial
relations
of
the
united
states
therewith
has
submitted
reports
which
will
be
laid
before
you
no
opportunity
has
been
omitted
to
testify
the
friendliness
of
this
government
toward
korea
whose
entrance
into
the
family
of
treaty
powers
the
united
states
were
the
first
to
recognize
i
regard
with
favor
the
application
made
by
the
korean
government
to
be
allowed
to
employ
american
officers
as
military
instructors
to
which
the
assent
of
congress
becomes
necessary
and
i
am
happy
to
say
this
request
has
the
concurrent
sanction
of
china
and
japan
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
julio
r
santos
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
by
the
authorities
of
ecuador
gave
rise
to
a
contention
with
that
government
in
which
his
right
to
be
released
or
to
have
a
speedy
and
impartial
trial
on
announced
charges
and
with
all
guaranties
of
defense
stipulated
by
treaty
was
insisted
upon
by
us
after
an
elaborate
correspondence
and
repeated
and
earnest
representations
on
our
part
mr
santos
was
after
an
alleged
trial
and
conviction
eventually
included
in
a
general
decree
of
amnesty
and
pardoned
by
the
ecuadorian
executive
and
released
leaving
the
question
of
his
american
citizenship
denied
by
the
ecuadorian
government
but
insisted
upon
by
our
own
the
amount
adjudged
by
the
late
french
and
american
claims
commission
to
be
due
from
the
united
states
to
french
claimants
on
account
of
injuries
suffered
by
them
during
the
war
of
secession
having
been
appropriated
by
the
last
congress
has
been
duly
paid
to
the
french
government
the
act
of
february
provided
for
a
preliminary
search
of
the
records
of
french
prize
courts
for
evidence
bearing
on
the
claims
of
american
citizens
against
france
for
spoliations
committed
prior
to
the
duty
has
been
performed
and
the
report
of
the
agent
will
be
laid
before
you
i
regret
to
say
that
the
restrictions
upon
the
importation
of
our
pork
into
france
continue

notwithstanding
the
abundant
demonstration
of
the
absence
of
sanitary
danger
in
its
use
but
i
entertain
strong
hopes
that
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
matter
this
vexatious
prohibition
will
be
removed
it
would
be
pleasing
to
be
able
to
say
as
much
with
respect
to
germany
austria
and
other
countries
where
such
food
products
are
absolutely
excluded
without
present
prospect
of
reasonable
change
the
interpretation
of
our
existing
treaties
of
naturalization
by
germany
during
the
past
year
has
attracted
attention
by
reason
of
an
apparent
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
imperial
government
to
extend
the
scope
of
the
residential
restrictions
to
which
returning
naturalized
citizens
of
german
origin
are
asserted
to
be
liable
under
the
laws
of
the
empire
the
temperate
and
just
attitude
taken
by
this
government
with
regard
to
this
class
of
questions
will
doubtless
lead
to
a
satisfactory
understanding
the
dispute
of
germany
and
spain
relative
to
the
domination
of
the
caroline
islands
has
attracted
the
attention
of
this
government
by
reason
of
extensive
interests
of
american
citizens
having
grown
up
in
those
parts
during
the
past
thirty
years
and
because
the
question
of
ownership
involves
jurisdiction
of
matters
affecting
the
status
of
our
citizens
under
civil
and
criminal
law
while
standing
wholly
aloof
from
the
proprietary
issues
raised
between
powers
to
both
of
which
the
united
states
are
friendly
this
government
expects
that
nothing
in
the
present
contention
shall
unfavorably
affect
our
citizens
carrying
on
a
peaceful
commerce
or
there
domiciled
and
has
so
informed
the
governments
of
spain
and
germany
the
marked
good
will
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
has
been
maintained
during
the
past
year
the
termination
of
the
fishing
clauses
of
the
treaty
of
washington
in
pursuance
of
the
joint
resolution
of
march
must
have
resulted
in
the
abrupt
cessation
on
the
st
of
july
of
this
year
in
the
midst
of
their
ventures
of
the
operations
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
engaged
in
fishing
in
british
american
waters
but
for
a
diplomatic
understanding
reached
with
her
majestys
government
in
june
last
whereby
assurance
was
obtained
that
no
interruption
of
those
operations
should
take
place
during
the
current
fishing
season
in
the
interest
of
good
neighborhood
and
of
the
commercial
intercourse
of
adjacent
communities
the
question
of
the
north
american
fisheries
is
one
of
much
importance
following
out
the
intimation
given
by
me
when
the
extensory
arrangement
above
described
was
negotiated
i
recommend
that
the
congress
provide
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
in
which
the
governments
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain
shall
be
respectively
represented
charged
with
the
consideration
and
settlement
upon
a
just
equitable
and
honorable
basis
of
the
entire
question
of
the
fishing
rights
of
the
two
governments
and
their
respective
citizens
on
the
coasts
of
the
united
states
and
british
north
america
the
fishing
interests
being
intimately
related
to
other
general
questions
dependent
upon
contiguity
and
intercourse
consideration
thereof
in
all
their
equities
might
also
properly
come
within
the
purview
of
such
a
commission
and
the
fullest
latitude
of
expression
on
both
sides
should
be
permitted
the
correspondence
in
relation
to
the
fishing
rights
will
be
submitted
the
arctic
exploring
steamer

which
was
generously
given
by
her
majestys
government
to
aid
in
the
relief
of
the
greely

after
the
successful
attainment
of
that
humane
purpose

britain
in
pursuance
of
the
authority
conferred
by
the
act
of
march
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
engagements
for
extradition
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
has
been
long
apparent
the
tenth
article
of
the
treaty
of
one
of
the
earliest
compacts
in
this
regard
entered
into
by
us
stipulated
for
surrender
in
respect
of
a
limited
number
of
offenses
other
crimes
no
less
inimical
to
the
social
welfare
should
be
embraced
and
the
procedure
of
extradition
brought
in
harmony
with
present
international
practice
negotiations
with
her
majestys
government
for
an
enlarged
treaty
of
extradition
have
been
pending
since
and
i
entertain
strong
hopes
that
a
satisfactory
result
may
be
soon
attained
the
frontier
line
between
alaska
and
british
columbia
as
defined
by
the
treaty
of
cession
with
russia
follows
the
demarcation
assigned
in
a
prior
treaty
between
great
britain
and
russia
modern
exploration
discloses
that
this
ancient
boundary
is
impracticable
as
a
geographical
fact
in
the
unsettled
condition
of
that
region
the
question
has
lacked
importance
but
the
discovery
of
mineral
wealth
in
the
territory
the
line
is
supposed
to
traverse
admonishes
that
the
time
has
come
when
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
boundary
is
needful
to
avert
jurisdictional
complications
i
recommend
therefore
that
provision
be
made
for
a
preliminary
reconnoissance
by
officers
of
the
united
states
to
the
end
of
acquiring
more
precise
information
on
the
subject
i
have
invited
her
majestys
government
to
consider
with
us
the
adoption
of
a
more
convenient
line
to
be
established
by
meridian
observations
or
by
known
geographical
features
without
the
necessity
of
an
expensive
survey
of
the
whole
the
late
insurrectionary
movements
in
hayti
having
been
quelled
the
government
of
that
republic
has
made
prompt
provision
for
adjudicating
the
losses
suffered
by
foreigners
because
of
hostilities
there
and
the
claims
of
certain
citizens
of
the
united
states
will
be
in
this
manner
determined
the
longpending
claims
of
two
citizens
of
the
united
states
pelletier
and
lazare
have
been
disposed
of
by
arbitration
and
an
award
in
favor
of
each
claimant
has
been
made
which
by
the
terms
of
the
engagement
is
final
it
remains
for
congress
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
stipulated
moiety
of
the
expenses
a
question
arose
with
hayti
during
the
past
year
by
reason
of
the
exceptional
treatment
of
an
american
citizen
mr
van
bokkelen
a
resident
of
portauprince
who
on
suit
by
creditors
residing
in
the
united
states
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
and
under
the
operation
of
a
haytian
statute
was
denied
relief
secured
to
a
native
haytian
this
government
asserted
his
treaty
right
to
equal
treatment
with
natives
of
hayti
in
all
suits
at
law
our
contention
was
denied
by
the
haytian
government
which
however
while
still
professing
to
maintain
the
ground
taken
against
mr
van
bokkelens
right
terminated
the
controversy
by
setting
him
at
liberty
without
explanation
an
international
conference
to
consider
the
means
of
arresting
the
spread
of
cholera
and
other
epidemic
diseases

held
at

adjourned
to

to
be
most
cordial

befits
those
of
neighbors
between
whom
the
strongest
ties
of
friendship
and
commercial
intimacy
exist
as
the
natural
and
growing
consequence
of

similarity
of

propinquity

of
the

the
united

westward
of

the
convention
of

has
been
unavoidably
delayed
but
i
apprehend
no
difficulty
in
securing
a
prolongation
of
the
period
for
its
accomplishment
the
lately
concluded
commercial
treaty
with
mexico
still
awaits
the
stipulated
legislation
to
carry
its
provisions
into

one
years
additional
time
has
been
secured
by
a
supplementary
article
signed
in

ratified

both
sides

have
been
instituted
at

for
a
full
treaty
not

in
the
line
of
the
general
policy
touc
hing
the

advert

at

is

i
am
compelled
to
delay
its
announcement
an
international
copyright
conference
was
held
at
berne
in
september
on
the
invitation
of
the
swiss
government
the
envoy
of
the
united
states
attended
as
a
delegate
but
refrained
from
committing
this
government
to
the
results
even
by
signing
the
recommendatory
protocol
adopted
the
interesting
and
important
subject
of
international
copyright
has
been
before
you
for
several
years
action
is
certainly
desirable
to
effect
the
object
in
view
and
while
there
may
be
question
as
to
the
relative
advantage
of
treating
it
by
legislation
or
by
specific
treaty
the
matured
views
of
the
berne
conference
can
not
fail
to
aid
your
consideration
of
the
subject
the
termination
of
the
commercial
treaty
of
between
the
united
states
and
turkey
has
been
sought
by
that
government
while
there
is
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
notice
of
termination
given
yet
as
the
commercial
rights
of
our
citizens
in
turkey
come
under
the
favorednation
guaranties
of
the
prior
treaty
of
and
as
equal
treatment
is
admitted
by
the
porte
no
inconvenience
can
result
from
the
assent
of
this
government
to
the
revision
of
the
ottoman
tariffs
in
which
the
treaty
powers
have
been
invited
to
join
questions
concerning
our
citizens
in
turkey
may
be
affected
by
the
portes
nonacquiescence
in
the
right
of
expatriation
and
by
the
imposition
of
religious
tests
as
a
condition
of
residence
in
which
this
government
can
not
concur
the
united
states
must
hold
in
their
intercourse
with
every
power
that
the
status
of
their
citizens
is
to
be
respected
and
equal
civil
privileges
accorded
to
them
without
regard
to
creed
and
affected
by
no
considerations
save
those
growing
out
of
domiciliary
return
to
the
land
of
original
allegiance
or
of
unfulfilled
personal
obligations
which
may
survive
under
municipal
laws
after
such
voluntary
return
the
negotiation
with
venezuela
relative
to
the
rehearing
of
the
awards
of
the
mixed
commission
constituted
under
the
treaty
of
was
resumed
in
view
of
the
recent
acquiescence
of
the
venezuelan
envoy
in
the
principal
point
advanced
by
this
government
that
the
effects
of
the
old
treaty
could
only
be
set
aside
by
the
operation
of
a
new
convention
a
result
in
substantial
accord
with
the
advisory
suggestions
contained
in
the
joint
resolution
of
march
has
been
agreed
upon
and
will
shortly
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
under
section
of
the
revised
statutes
all
funds
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
and
the
annual
interest
accruing
thereon
when
not
otherwise
required
by
treaty
are
to
be
invested
in
stocks
of
the
united
states
bearing
a
rate
of
interest
not
less
than
per
cent
per
annum
there
being
now
no
procurable
stocks
paying
so
high
a
rate
of
interest
the
letter
of
the
statute
is
at
present
inapplicable
but
its
spirit
is
subserved
by
continuing
to
make
investments
of
this
nature
in
current
stocks
bearing
the
highest
interest
now
paid
the
statute
however
makes
no
provision
for
the
disposal
of
such
accretions
it
being
contrary
to
the
general
rule
of
this
government
to
allow
interest
on
claims
i
recommend
the
repeal
of
the
provision
in
question
and
the
disposition
under
a
uniform
rule
of
the
present
accumulations
from
investment
of
trust
funds
the
inadequacy
of
existing
legislation
touching
citizenship
and
naturalization
demands
your
consideration
while
recognizing
the
right
of
expatriation
no
statutory
provision
exists
providing
means
for
renouncing
citizenship
by
an
american
citizen
native
born
or
naturalized
nor
for
terminating
and
vacating
an
improper
acquisition
of
citizenship
even
a
fraudulent
decree
of
naturalization
can
not
now
be
canceled
the
privilege
and
franchise
of
american
citizenship
should
be
granted
with
care
and
extended
to
those
only
who
intend
in
good
faith
to
assume
its
duties
and
responsibilities
when
attaining
its
privileges
and
benefits
it
should
be
withheld
from
those
who
merely
go
through
the
forms
of
naturalization
with
the
intent
of
escaping
the
duties
of
their
original
allegiance
without
taking
upon
themselves
those
of
their
new
status
or
who
may
acquire
the
rights
of
american
citizenship
for
no
other
than
a
hostile
purpose
toward
their
original
governments
these
evils
have
had
many
flagrant
illustrations
i
regard
with
favor
the
suggestion
put
forth
by
one
of
my
predecessors
that
provision
be
made
for
a
central
bureau
of
record
of
the
decrees
of
naturalization
granted
by
the
various
courts
throughout
the
united
states
now
invested
with
that
power
the
rights
which
spring
from
domicile
in
the
united
states
especially
when
coupled
with
a
declaration
of
intention
to
become
a
citizen
are
worthy
of
definition
by
statute
the
stranger
coming
hither
with
intent
to
remain
establishing
his
residence
in
our
midst
contributing
to
the
general
welfare
and
by
his
voluntary
act
declaring
his
purpose
to
assume
the
responsibilities
of
citizenship
thereby
gains
an
inchoate
status
which
legislation
may
properly
define
the
laws
of
certain
states
and
territories
admit
a
domiciled
alien
to
the
local
franchise
conferring
on
him
the
rights
of
citizenship
to
a
degree
which
places
him
in
the
anomalous
position
of
being
a
citizen
of
a
state
and
yet
not
of
the
united
states
within
the
purview
of
federal
and
international
law
it
is
important
within
the
scope
of
national
legislation
to
define
this
right
of
alien
domicile
as
distinguished
from
federal
naturalization
the
commercial
relations
of
the
united
states
with
their
immediate
neighbors
and
with
important
areas
of
traffic
near
our
shores
suggest
especially
liberal
intercourse
between
them
and
us
following
the
treaty
of
with
mexico
which
rested
on
the
basis
of
a
reciprocal
exemption
from
customs
duties
other
similar
treaties
were
initiated
by
my
predecessor
recognizing
the
need
of
less
obstructed
traffic
with
cuba
and
puerto
rico
and
met
by
the
desire
of
spain
to
succor
languishing
interests
in
the
antilles
steps
were
taken
to
attain
those
ends
by
a
treaty
of
commerce
a
similar
treaty
was
afterwards
signed
by
the
dominican
republic
subsequently
overtures
were
made
by
her
britannic
majestys
government
for
a
like
mutual
extension
of
commercial
intercourse
with
the
british
west
indian
and
south
american
dependencies
but
without
result
on
taking
office
i
withdrew
for
reexamination
the
treaties
signed
with
spain
and
santo
domingo
then
pending
before
the
senate
the
result
has
been
to
satisfy
me
of
the
inexpediency
of
entering
into
engagements
of
this
character
not
covering
the
entire
traffic
these
treaties
contemplated
the
surrender
by
the
united
states
of
large
revenues
for
inadequate
considerations
upon
sugar
alone
duties
were
surrendered
to
an
amount
far
exceeding
all
the
advantages
offered
in
exchange
even
were
it
intended
to
relieve
our
consumers
it
was
evident
that
so
long
as
the
exemption
but
partially
covered
our
importation
such
relief
would
be
illusory
to
relinquish
a
revenue
so
essential
seemed
highly
improvident
at
a
time
when
new
and
large
drains
upon
the
treasury
were
contemplated
moreover
embarrassing
questions
would
have
arisen
under
the
favorednation
clauses
of
treaties
with
other
nations
as
a
further
objection
it
is
evident
that
tariff
regulation
by
treaty
diminishes
that
independent
control
over
its
own
revenues
which
is
essential
for
the
safety
and
welfare
of
any
government
emergency
calling
for
an
increase
of
taxation
may
at
any
time
arise
and
no
engagement
with
a
foreign
power
should
exist
to
hamper
the
action
of
the
government
by
the
fourteenth
section
of
the
shipping
act
approved
june
certain
reductions
and
contingent
exemptions
from
tonnage
dues
were
made
as
to
vessels
entering
ports
of
the
united
states
from
any
foreign
port
in
north
and
central
america
the
west
india
islands
the
bahamas
and
bermudas
mexico
and
the
isthmus
as
far
as
aspinwall
and
panama
the
governments
of
belgium
denmark
germany
portugal
and
sweden
and
norway
have
asserted
under
the
favorednation
clause
in
their
treaties
with
the
united
states
a
claim
to
like
treatment
in
respect
of
vessels
coming
to
the
united
states
from
their
home
ports
this
government
however
holds
that
the
privileges
granted
by
the
act
are
purely
geographical
inuring
to
any
vessel
of
any
foreign
power
that
may
choose
to
engage
in
traffic
between
this
country
and
any
port
within
the
defined
zone
and
no
warrant
exists
under
the
mostfavorednation
clause
for
the
extension
of
the
privileges
in
question
to
vessels
sailing
to
this
country
from
ports
outside
the
limitation
of
the
act
undoubtedly
the
relations
of
commerce
with
our
near
neighbors
whose
territories
form
so
long
a
frontier
line
difficult
to
be
guarded
and
who
find
in
our
country
and
equally
offer
to
us
natural
markets
demand
special
and
considerate
treatment
it
rests
with
congress
to
consider
what
legislative
action
may
increase
facilities
of
intercourse
which
contiguity
makes
natural
and
desirable
i
earnestly
urge
that
congress
recast
the
appropriations
for
the
maintenance
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
on
a
footing
commensurate
with
the
importance
of
our
national
interests
at
every
post
where
a
representative
is
necessary
the
salary
should
be
so
graded
as
to
permit
him
to
live
with
comfort
with
the
assignment
of
adequate
salaries
the
socalled
notarial
extra
official
fees
which
our
officers
abroad
are
now
permitted
to
treat
as
personal
perquisites
should
be
done
away
with
every
act
requiring
the
certification
and
seal
of
the
officer
should
be
taxable
at
schedule
rates
and
the
fee
therefor
returned
to
the
treasury
by
restoring
these
revenues
to
the
public
use
the
consular
service
would
be
selfsupporting
even
with
a
liberal
increase
of
the
present
low
salaries
in
further
prevention
of
abuses
a
system
of
consular
inspection
should
be
instituted
the
appointment
of
a
limited
number
of
secretaries
of
legation
at
la
rge
to
be
assigned
to
duty
wherever
necessary
and
in
particular
for
temporary
service
at
missions
which
for
any
cause
may
be
without
a
head
should
also
be
authorized
i
favor
also
authorization
for
the
detail
of
officers
of
the
regular
service
as
military
or
naval
attaches
at
legations
some
foreign
governments
do
not
recognize
the
union
of
consular
with
diplomatic
functions
italy
and
venezuela
will
only
receive
the
appointee
in
one
of
his
two
capacities
but
this
does
not
prevent
the
requirement
of
a
bond
and
submission
to
the
responsibilities
of
an
office
whose
duties
he
can
not
discharge
the
superadded
title
of
consulgeneral
should
be
abandoned
at
all
missions
i
deem
it
expedient
that
a
welldevised
measure
for
the
reorganization
of
the
extraterritorial
courts
in
oriental
countries
should
replace
the
present
system
which
labors
under
the
disadvantage
of
combining
judicial
and
executive
functions
in
the
same
office
in
several
oriental
countries
generous
offers
have
been
made
of
premises
for
housing
the
legations
of
the
united
states
a
grant
of
land
for
that
purpose
was
made
some
years
since
by
japan
and
has
been
referred
to
in
the
annual
messages
of
my
predecessor
the
siamese
government
has
made
a
gift
to
the
united
states
of
commodious
quarters
in
bangkok
in
korea
the
late
minister
was
permitted
to
purchase
a
building
from
the
government
for
legation
use
in
china
the
premises
rented
for
the
legation
are
favored
as
to
local
charges
at
tangier
the
house
occupied
by
our
representative
has
been
for
many
years
the
property
this
government
having
been
given
for
that
purpose
in
by
the
sultan
of
morocco
i
approve
the
suggestion
heretofore
made
that
view
of
the
conditions
of
life
and
administration
in
the
eastern
countries
the
legation
buildings
in
china
japan
korea
siam
and
perhaps
persia
should
be
owned
and
furnished
by
the
government
with
a
view
to
permanency
and
security
to
this
end
i
recommend
that
authority
be
given
to
accept
the
gifts
adverted
to
in
japan
and
siam
and
to
purchase
in
the
other
countries
named
with
provision
for
furniture
and
repairs
a
considerable
saving
in
rentals
would
result
the

industrial
exposition
held
at
new
orleans
last
winter
with
the
assistance
of
the
federal
government
attracted
a
large
number
of
foreign
exhibits
and
proved
of
great
value
in
spreading
among
the
concourse
of
visitors
from
mexico
and
central
and
south
america
a
wider
knowledge
of
the
varied
manufactures
and
productions
of
this
country
and
their
availability
in
exchange
for
the
productions
of
those
regions
past
congresses
have
had
under
consideration
the
advisability
of
abolishing
the
discrimination
made
by
the
tariff
laws
in
favor
of
the
works
of
american
artists
the
odium
of
the
policy
which
subjects
to
a
high
rate
of
duty
the
paintings
of
foreign
artists
and
exempts
the
productions
of
american
artists
residing
abroad
and
who
receive
gratuitously
advantages
and
instruction
is
visited
upon
our
citizens
engaged
in
art
culture
in
europe
and
has
caused
them
with
practical
unanimity
to
favor
the
abolition
of
such
an
ungracious
distinction
and
in
their
interest
and
for
other
obvious
reasons
i
strongly
recommend
it
the
report
of
the

the

the

operations
of
this
important
department
and
his
recommendations
in
the
direction
of
simplification

economy
particularly
in
the
work
of

are
especially
urged
upon
the
attention

the
total

as

this
diminution
embraces
a
falling
off

in

the

the
fact
that
our
revenues
are
in
excess
of
the
actual
needs
of
all
economical
administration
of

justifies
a
reduction
in
the
amount
exacted

our

is
but
the
means
established
by
the
will
of
a
free
people
by
which
certain
principles
are
applied
which
they
have
adopted
for
their
benefit
and
protection
and
it
is
never
better
administered
and
its
true
spirit
is
never
better
observed
than
when
the
peoples
taxation
for
its
support
is
scrupulously
limited
to
the
actual
necessity
of
expenditure
and
distributed
according
to
a
just
and
equitable
plan
the
proposition
with
which
we
have
to
deal
is
the
reduction
of
the
revenue
received
by
the
government
and
indirectly
paid
by
the
people
from
customs
duties
the
question
of
free
trade
is
not
involved
nor
is
there
now
any
occasion
for
the
general
discussion
of
the
wisdom
or
expediency
of
a
protective
system
justice
and
fairness
dictate
that
in
any
modification

the
industries
and
interests
which
have
been
encouraged
by
such
laws
and
in
which
our
citizens
have
large
investments
should
not
be
ruthlessly
injured
or
destroyed
we
should
also
deal
with
the
subject
in
such
manner
as
to
protect
the
interests
of
american
labor
which
is
the
capital
of
our
workingmen
its
stability
and
proper
remuneration
furnish
the
most
justifiable
pretext
for
a
protective
policy
within
these
limitations
a
certain
reduction
should
be
made
in
our
customs
revenue
the
amount
of
such
reduction
having
been
determined
the
inquiry
follows
where
can
it
best
be
remitted
and
what
articles
can
best
be
released
from
duty
in
the
interest
of
our
citizens
i
think
the
reduction
should
be
made
in
the
revenue
derived
from
a
tax
upon
the
imported
necessaries
of
life
we
thus
directly
lessen
the
cost
of
living
in
every
family
of
the
land
and
release
to
the
people
in
every
humble
home
a
larger
measure
of
the
rewards
of
frugal
industry
during
the
year
ended
november
national
banks
were
organized
with
an
aggregate
capital
of
and
circulating
notes
have
been
issued
to
them
amounting
to
the
whole
number
of
these
banks
in
existence
on
the
day
above
mentioned
was
the
very
limited
amount
of
circulating
notes
issued
by
our
national
banks
compared
with
the
amount
the
law
permits
them
to
issue
upon
a
deposit
of
bonds
for
their
redemption
indicates
that
the
volume
of
our
circulating
medium
may
be
largely
increased
through
this
instrumentality
nothing
more
important
than
the
present
condition
of
our
currency
and
coinage
can
claim
your
attention
since
february
the
government
has
under
the
compulsory
provisions
of
law
purchased
silver
bullion
and
coined
the
same
at
the
rate
of
more
than
every
month
by
this
process
up
to
the
present
date
silver
dollars
have
been
coined
a
reasonable
appreciation
of
a
delegation
of
power
to
the
general
government
would
limit
its
exercise
without
express
restrictive
words
to
the
peoples
needs
and
the
requirements
of
the
public
welfare
upon
this
theory
the
authority
to
coin
money
given
to
congress
by
the
constitution
if
it
permits
the
purchase
by
the
government
of
bullion
for
coinage
in
any
event
does
not
justify
such
purchase
and
coinage
to
an
extent
beyond
the
amount
needed
for
a
sufficient
circulating
medium
the
desire
to
utilize
the
silver
product
of
the
country
should
not
lead
to
a
misuse
or
the
perversion
of
this
power
the
necessity
for
such
an
addition
to
the
silver
currency
of
the
nation
as
is
compelled
by
the
silvercoinage
act
is
negatived
by
the
fact
that
up
to
the
present
time
only
about
of
the
silver
dollars
so
coined
have
actually
found
their
way
into
circulation
leaving
more
than
in
the
possession
of
the
government
the
custody
of
which
has
entailed
a
considerable
expense
for
the
construction
of
vaults
for
it
deposit
against
this
latter
amount
there
are
outstanding
silver
certificates
amounting
to
about
every
month
two
millions
of
gold
in
the
public
treasury
are
paid
our
for
two
millions
or
more
of
silver
dollars
to
be
added
to
the
idle
mass
already
accumulated
if
continued
long
enough
this
operation
will
result
in
the
substitution
of
silver
for
all
the
gold
the
government
owns
applicable
to
its
general
purposes
it
will
not
do
to
rely
upon
the
customs
receipts
of
the
government
to
make
good
this
drain
of
gold
because
the
silver
thus
coined
having
been
made
legal
tender
for
all
debts
and
dues
public
and
private
at
times
during
the
last
six
months
per
cent
of
the
receipts
for
duties
has
been
in
silver
or
silver
certificates
while
the
average
within
that
period
has
been
per
cent
the
proportion
of
silver
and
its
certificates
received
by
the
government
will
probably
increase
as
time
goes
on
for
the
reason
that
the
neare
r
the
period
approaches
when
it
will
be
obliged
to
offer
silver
in
payment
of
its
obligations
the
greater
inducement
there
will
be
to
hoard
gold
against
depreciation
in
the
value
of
silver
or
for
the
purpose
of
speculating
this
hoarding
of
gold
has
already
begun
when
the
time
comes
that
gold
has
been
withdrawn
from
circulation
then
will
be
apparent
the
difference
between
the
real
value
of
the
silver
dollar
and
a
dollar
in
gold
and
the
two
coins
will
part
company
gold
still
the
standard
of
value
and
necessary
in
our
dealings
with
other
countries
will
be
at
a
premium
over
silver
banks
which
have
substituted
gold
for
the
deposits
of
their
customers
may
pay
them
with
silver
bought
with
such
gold
thus
making
a
handsome
profit
rich
speculators
will
sell
their
hoarded
gold
to
their
neighbors
who
need
it
to
liquidate
their
foreign
debts
at
a
ruinous
premium
over
silver
and
the
laboring
men
and
women
of
the
land
most
defenseless
of
all
will
find
that
the
dollar
received
for
the
wage
of
their
toil
has
sadly
shrunk
in
its
purchasing
power
it
may
be
said
that
the
latter
result
will
be
but
temporary
and
that
ultimately
the
price
of
labor
will
be
adjusted
to
the
change
but
even
if
this
takes
place
the
wageworker
can
not
possibly
gain
but
must
inevitably
lose
since
the
price
he
is
compelled
to
pay
for
his
living
will
not
only
be
measured
in
a
coin
heavily
depreciated
and
fluctuating
and
uncertain
in
its
value
but
this
uncertainty
in
the
value
of
the
purchasing
medium
will
be
made
the
pretext
for
an
advance
in
prices
beyond
that
justified
by
actual
depreciation
the
words
uttered
in
by
daniel
webster
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
are
true
today
the
very
man
of
all
others
who
has
the
deepest
interest
in
a
sound
currency
and
who
suffers
most
by
mischievous
legislation
in
money
matters
is
the
man
who
earns
his
daily
bread
by
his
daily
toil
the
most
distinguished
advocate
of
bimetallism
discussing
our
silver
coinage
has
lately
written
no
american
citizens
hand
has
yet
felt
the
sensation
of
cheapness
either
in
receiving
or
expending
the
silveract
dollars
and
those
who
live
by
labor
or
legitimate
trade
never
will
feel
that
sensation
of
cheapness
however
plenty
silver
dollars
may
become
they
will
not
be
distributed
as
gifts
among
the
people
and
if
the
laboring
man
should
receive
four
depreciated
dollars
where
he
now
receives
but
two
he
will
pay
in
the
depreciated
coin
more
than
double
the
price
he
now
pays
for
all
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
those
who
do
not
fear
any
disastrous
consequences
arising
from
the
continued
compulsory
coinage
of
silver
as
now
directed
by
law
and
who
suppose
that
the
addition
to
the
currency
of
the
country
intended
as
its
result
will
be
a
public
benefit
are
reminded
that
history
demonstrates
that
the
point
is
easily
reached
in
the
attempt
to
float
at
the
same
time
two
sorts
of
money
of
different
excellence
when
the
better
will
cease
to
be
in
general
circulation
the
hoarding
of
gold
which
has
already
taken
place
indicates
that
we
shall
not
escape
the
usual
experience
in
such
cases
so
if
this
silver
coinage
be
continued
we
may
reasonably
expect
that
gold
and
its
equivalent
will
abandon
the
field
of
circulation
to
silver
alone
this
of
course
must
produce
a
severe
contraction
of
our
circulating
medium
instead
of
adding
to
it
it
will
not
be
disputed
that
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
cause
the
circulation
of
silver
dollars
worth
cents
side
by
side
with
gold
dollars
worth
cents
even
within
the
limit
that
legislation
does
not
run
counter
to
the
laws
of
trade
to
be
successful
must
be
seconded
by
the
confidence
of
the
people
that
both
coins
will
retain
the
same
purchasing
power
and
be
interchangeable
at
will
a
special
effort
has
been
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
increase
the
amount
of
our
silver
coin
in
circulation
but
the
fact
that
a
large
share
of
the
limited
amount
thus
put
out
has
soon
returned
to
the
public
treasury
in
payment
of
duties
leads
to
the
belief
that
the
people
do
not
now
desire
to
keep
it
in
hand
and
this
with
the
evident
disposition
to
hoard
gold
gives
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
there
already
exists
a
lack
of
confidence
among
the
people
touching
our
financial
processes
there
is
certainly
not
enough
silver
now
in
circulation
to
cause
uneasiness
and
the
whole
amount
coined
and
now
on
hand
might
after
a
time
be
absorbed
by
the
people
without
apprehension
but
it
is
the
ceaseless
stream
that
threatens
to
overflow
the
land
which
causes
fear
and
uncertainty
what
has
been
thus
far
submitted
upon
this
subject
relates
almost
entirely
to
considerations
of
a
home
nature
unconnected
with
the
bearing
which
the
policies
of
other
nations
have
upon
the
question
but
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
a
line
of
action
in
regard
to
our
currency
can
not
wisely
be
settled
upon
or
persisted
in
without
considering
the
attitude
on
the
subject
of
other
countries
with
whom
we
maintain
intercourse
through
commerce
trade
and
travel
an
acknowledgment
of
this
fact
is
found
in
the
act
by
virtue
of
which
our
silver
is
compulsorily
coined
it
provides
thatthe
president
shall
invite
the
governments
of
the
countries
composing
the
latin
union
so
called
and
of
such
other
european
nations
as
he
may
deem
advisable
to
join
the
united
states
in
a
conference
to
adopt
a
common
ratio
between
gold
and
silver
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
internationally
the
use
of
bimetallic
money
and
securing
fixity
of
relative
value
between
those
metals
this
conference
absolutely
failed
and
a
similar
fate
has
awaited
all
subsequent
efforts
in
the
same
direction
and
still
we
continue
our
coinage
of
silver
at
a
ratio
different
from
that
of
any
other
nation
the
most
vital
part
of
the
silvercoinage
act
remains
inoperative
and
unexecuted
and
without
an
ally
or
friend
we
battle
upon
the
silver
field
in
an
illogical
and
losing
contest
to
give
full
effect
to
the
design
of
congress
on
this
subject
i
have
made
careful
and
earnest
endeavor
since
the
adjournment
of
the
last
congress
to
this
end
i
delegated
a
gentleman
well
instructed
in
fiscal
science
to
proceed
to
the
financial
centers
of
europe
and
in
conjunction
with
our
ministers
to
england
france
and
germany
to
obtain
a
full
knowledge
of
the
attitude
and
intent
of
those
governments
in
respect
of
the
establishment
of
such
an
international
ratio
as
would
procure
free
coinage
of
both
metals
at
the
mints
of
those
countries
and
our
own
by
my
direction
our
consulgeneral
at
paris
has
given
close
attention
to
the
proceedings
of
the
congress
of
the
latin
union
in
order
to
indicate
our
interest
in
its
objects
and
report
its
action
it
may
be
said
in
brief
as
the
result
of
these
efforts
that
the
attitude
of
the
leading
powers
remains
substantially
unchanged
since
the
monetary
conference
of
nor
is
it
to
be
questioned
that
the
views
of
these
governments
are
in
each
instance
supported
by
the
weight
of
public
opinion
the
steps
thus
taken
have
therefore
only
more
fully
demonstrated
the
uselessness
of
further
attempts
at
present
to
arrive
at
any
agreement
on
the
subject
with
other
nations
in
the
meantime
we
are
accumulating
silver
coin
based
upon
our
own
peculiar
ratio
to
such
an
extent
and
assuming
so
heavy
a
burden
to
be
provided
for
in
any
international
negotiations
as
will
render
us
an
undesirable
party
to
any
future
monetary
conference
of
nations
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
four
of
the
five
countries
composing
the
latin
union
mentioned
in
our
coinage
act
embarrassed
with
their
silver
currency
have
just
completed
an
agreement
among
themselves
that
no
more
silver
shall
be
coined
by
their
respective
governments
and
that
such
as
has
been
already
coined
and
in
circulation
shall
be
redeemed
in
gold
by
the
country
of
its
coinage
the
resort
to
this
expedient
by
these
countries
may
well
arrest
the
attention
of
those
who
suppose
that
we
can
succeed
without
shock
or
injury
in
the
attempt
to
circulate
upon
its
merits
all
the
silver
we
may
coin
under
the
provisions
of
our
silvercoinage
act
the
condition
in
which
our
treasury
may
be
placed
by
a
persistence
in
our
present
course
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
every
patriotic
citizen
who
does
not
desire
his
government
to
pay
in
silver
such
of
its
obligations
as
should
be
paid
in
gold
nor
should
our
condition
be
such
as
to
oblige
us
in
a
prudent
management
of
our
affairs
to
discontinue
the
calling
in
and
payment
of
interestbearing
obligations
which
we
have
the
right
now
to
discharge
and
thus
avoid
the
payment
of
further
interest
thereon
the
socalled
debtor
class
for
whose
benefit
the
continued
compulsory
coinage
of
silver
is
insisted
upon
are
not
dishonest
because
they
are
in
debt
and
they
should
not
be
suspected
of
a
desire
to
jeopardize
the
financial
safety
of
the
country
in
order
that
they
may
cancel
their
present
debts
by
paying
the
same
in
depreciated
dollars
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
it
is
not
the
rich
nor
the
money
lender
alone
that
must
submit
to
such
a
readjustment
enforced
by
the
government
and
their
debtors
the
pittance
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
the
incomes
of
helpless
beneficiaries
of
all
kinds
would
be
disastrously
reduced
the
depositors
in
savings

and
in
other
institutions
which
hold
in
trust
the
savings
of
the
poor
when
their
little
accumulations
are
scaled
down
to
meet
the
new
order
of
things

in
their
distress
painfully
realize
the
delusion
of
the
promise
made
to
them
that
plentiful
money
would
improve
their
condition
we
have
now
on
hand
all
the
silver
dollars
necessary
to
supply
the
present
needs
of
the
people
and
to
satisfy
those
who
from
sentiment
wish
to
see
them
in
circulation
and
if
their
coinage
is
suspended
they
can
be
readily
obtained
by
all
who
desire
them
if
the
need
of
more
is
at
anytime
apparent
their
coinage
may
be
renewed
that
disaster
has
not
already
overtaken
us
furnishes
no
proof
that
danger
does
not
wait
upon
a
continuation
of
the
present
silver
coinage
we
have
been
saved
by
the
most
careful
management

unusual
expedients

a
combination
of
fortunate
conditions
and
by
a
confident
expectation
that
t

in

be

changed

be
returned

them
while

made
solely
with
reference
to
their
fitness
and
without
reference
to
their
political
or
party
affiliation
has
secured
the
result
which
may
confidently
be
expected
in
any
branch
of
public
employment
where
such
a
rule
is
applied
as
a
consequence
this
service
is
composed
of
men
well
qualified
for
the
performance
of
their
dangerous
and
exceptionally
important
duties
the
number
of
stations
in
commission
at
the
close
of
the
year
was
the
number
of
disasters
to
vessels
and
craft
of
all
kinds
within
their
field
of
action
was
the
number
of
persons
endangered
in
such
disasters
was
of
whom
were
saved
and
only
lost
other
lives
which
were
imperiled
though
not
by
disasters
to
shipping
were
also
rescued
and
a
large
amount
of
property
was
saved
through
the
aid
of
this
service
the
cost
of
its
maintenance
during
the
year
was
the
work
of
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey
was
during
the
last
fiscal
year
carried
on
within
the
boundaries
and
off
the
coasts
of
thirtytwo
states
two
territories
and
the
district
of
columbia
in
july
last
certain
irregularities
were
found
to
exist
in
the
management
of
this
bureau
which
led
to
a
prompt
investigation
of
its
methods
the
abuses
which
were
brought
to
light
by
this
examination
and
the
reckless
disregard
of
duty
and
the
interests
of
the
government
developed
on
the
part
of
some
of
those
connected
with
the
service
made
a
change
of
superintendency
and
a
few
of
its
other
officers
necessary
since
the
bureau
has
been
in
new
hands
an
introduction
of
economies
and
the
application
of
business
methods
have
produced
an
important
saving
to
the
government
and
a
promise
of
more
useful
results
this
service
has
never
been
regulated
by
anything
but
the
most
indefinite
legal
enactments
and
the
most
unsatisfactory
rules
it
was
many
years
ago
sanctioned
apparently
for
a
purpose
regarded
as
temporary
and
related
to
a
survey
of
our
coast
having
gained
a
place
in
the
appropriations
made
by
congress
it
has
gradually
taken
to
itself
powers
and
objects
not
contemplated
in
its
creation
and
extended
its
operations
until
it
sadly
needs
legislative
attention
so
far
as
a
further
survey
of
our
coast
is
concerned
there
seems
to
be
a
propriety
in
transferring
that
work
to
the
navy
department
the
other
duties
now
in
charge
of
this
establishment
if
they
can
not
be
profitably
attached
to
some
existing
department
or
other
bureau
should
be
prosecuted
under
a
law
exactly
defining
their
scope
and
purpose
and
with
a
careful
discrimination
between
the
scientific
inquiries
which
may
properly
be
assumed
by
the
government
and
those
which
should
be
undertaken
by
state
authority
or
by
individual
enterprise
it
is
hoped
that
the
report
of
the
congressional
committee
heretofore
appointed
to
investigate
this
and
other
like
matters
will
aid
in
the
accomplishment
of
proper
legislation
on
this
subject
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
is
herewith
submitted
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
to
the
detailed
account
which
it
contains
of
the
administration
of
his
department
and
his
recommendations
and
suggestions
for
the
improvement
of
the
service
the
army
consisted
at
the
date
of
the
last
consolidated
returns
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
the
expenses
of
the
departments
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
including
for
public
works
and
river
and
harbor
improvements
were
besides
the
troops
which
were
dispatched
in
pursuit
of
the
small
band
of
indians
who
left
their
reservation
in
arizona
and
committed
murders
and
outrages
two
regiments
of
cavalry
and
one
of
infantry
were
sent
last
july
to
the
indian
territory
to
prevent
an
outbreak
which
seemed
imminent
they
remained
to
aid
if
necessary
in
the
expulsion
of
intruders
upon
the
reservation
who
seemed
to
have
caused
the
discontent
among
the
indians
but
the
executive
proclamation
warning
them
to
remove
was
complied
with
without
their
interference
troops
were
also
sent
to
rock
springs
in
wyoming
territory
after
the
massacre
of
chinese
there
to
prevent
further
disturbance
and
afterwards
to
seattle
in
washington
territory
to
avert
a
threatened
attack
upon
chinese
laborers
and
domestic
violence
there
in
both
cases
the
mere
presence
of
the
troops
had
the
desired
effect
it
appears
that
the
number
of
desertions
has
diminished
but
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
they
numbered
and
one
instance
is
given
by
the
lieutenantgeneral
of
six
desertions
by
the
same
recruit
i
am
convinced
that
this
number
of
desertions
can
be
much
diminished
by
better
discipline
and
treatment
but
the
punishment
should
be
increased
for
repeated
offenses
these
desertions
might
also
be
reduced
by
lessening
the
term
of
first
enlistments
thus
allowing
a
discontented
recruit
to
contemplate
a
nearer
discharge
and
the
army
a
profitable
riddance
after
one
term
of
service
a
reenlistment
would
be
quite
apt
to
secure
a
contented
recruit
and
a
good
soldier
the
acting
judgeadvocategeneral
reports
that
the
number
of
trials
by
general
courtsmartial
during
the
year
was
and
that
trials
took
place
before
garrison
and
regimental
courtsmartial
the
suggestion
that
probably
more
than
half
the
army
have
been
tried
for
offenses
great
and
small
in
one
year
may
well
arrest
attention
of
course
many
of
these
trials
before
garrison
and
regimental
courtsmartial
were
for
offenses
almost
frivolous
and
there
should
i
think
be
a
way
devised
to
dispose
of
these
in
a
more
summary
and
less
inconvenient
manner
than
by
courtmartial
if
some
of
the
proceedings
of
courtsmartial
which
i
have
had
occasion
to
examine
present
the
ideas
of
justice
which
generally
prevail
in
these
tribunals
i
am
satisfied
that
they
should
be
much
reformed
if
the
honor
and
the
honesty
of
the
army
and
navy
are
by
their
instrumentality
to
be
vindicated
and
protected
the
board
on
fortifications
or
other
defenses
appointed
in
pursuance
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
approved
march
will
in
a
short
time
present
their
report
and
it
is
hoped
that
this
may
greatly
aid
the
legislation
so
necessary
to
remedy
the
present
defenseless
condition
of
our
seacoasts
the
work
of
the
signal
service
has
been
prosecuted
during
the
last
year
with
results
of
increasing
benefit
to
the
country
the
field
of
instruction
has
been
enlarged
with
a
view
of
adding
to
its
usefulness
the
number
of
stations
in
operation
june
was
telegraphic
reports
are
received
daily
from
stations
reports
are
also
received
from
canadian
stations
volunteer
observers
army
surgeons
at
military
posts
and
foreign
stations
the
expense
of
the
service
during
the
fiscal
year
after
deducting
receipts
from
military
telegraph
lines
was
in
view
of
the
fact
referred
to
by
the
secretary
of
war
that
the
work
of
this
service
ordinarily
is
of
a
scientific
nature
and
the
further
fact
that
it
is
assuming
larger
proportions
constantly
and
becoming
more
and
more
unsuited
to
the
fixed
rules
which
must
govern
the
army
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
it
should
be
separately
established
if
this
is
done
the
scope
and
extent
of
its
operations
should
as
nearly
as
possible
be
definitely
prescribed
by
law
and
always
capable
of
exact
ascertainment
the
military
academy
at
west
point
is
reported
as
being
in
a
high
state
of
efficiency
and
well
equipped
for
the
satisfactory
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
of
its
maintenance
the
fact
that
the
class
which
graduates
next
year
is
an
unusually
large
one
has
constrained
me
to
decline
to
make
appointments
to
second
lieutenancies
in
the
army
from
civil
life
so
that
such
vacancies
as
exist
in
these
places
may
be
reserved
for
such
graduates
and
yet
it
is
not
probable
that
there
will
be
enough
vacancies
to
provide
positions
for
them
all
when
they
leave
the
military
school
under
the
prevailing
law
and
usage
those
not
thus
assigned
to
duty
never
actively
enter
the
military
service
it
is
suggested
that
the
law
on
this
subject
be
changed
so
that
such
of
these
young
men
as
are
not
at
once
assigned
to
duty
after
graduation
may
be
retained
as
second
lieutenants
in
the
army
if
they
desire
it
subject
to
assignment
when
opportunity
occurs

and
under
proper
rules
as
to
priority
of
selection
the
expenditures
on
account
of
the
military
academy
for
the
last
fiscal
year
exclusive
of
the
sum
taken
for
its
purposes
from
appropriations
for
the
support
of
the
army
were
the
act
approved
march
designed
to
compensate
officers
and
enlisted
men
for
loss
of
private
property
while
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
is
so
indefinite
in
its
terms
and
apparently
admits
so
many
claims
the
adjustment
of
which
could
not
have
been
contemplated
that
if
it
is
to
remain
upon
the
statute
book
it
needs
amendment
there
should
be
a
general
law
of
congress
prohibiting
the
construction
of
bridges
over
navigable
waters
in
such
manner
as
to
obstruct
navigation
with
provisions
for
preventing
the
same
it
seems
that
under
existing
statutes
the
government
can
not
intervene
to
prevent
such
a
construction
when
entered
upon
without
its
consent
though
when
such
consent
is
asked
and
granted
upon
condition
the
authority
to
insist
upon
such
condition
is
clear
thus
it
is
represented
that
while
the
officers
of
the
government
are
with
great
care
guarding
against
the
obstruction
of
navigation
by
a
bridge
across
the
mississippi
river
at
st
paul
a
large
pier
for
a
bridge
has
been
built
just
below
this
place
directly
in
the
navigable
channel
of
the
river
if
such
things
are
to
be
permitted
a
strong
argument
is
presented
against
the
appropriation
of
large
sums
of
money
to
improve
the
navigation
of
this
and
other
important
highways
of
commerce
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
gives
a
history
of
the
operations
of
his
department
and
the
present
condition
of
the
work
committed
to
his
charge
he
details
in
full
the
course
pursued
by
him
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
government
in
respect
of
certain
vessels
unfinished
at
the
time
of
his
accession
to
office
and
also
concerning
the
dispatch
boat
dolphin
claimed
to
be
completed
and
awaiting
the
acceptance
of
the
department
no
one
can
fail
to
see
from
recitals
contained
in
this
report
that
only
the
application
of
business
principles
has
been
insisted
upon
in
the
treatment
of
these
subjects
and
that
whatever
controversy
has
arisen
was
caused
by
the
exaction
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
contract
obligations
as
they
were
legally
construed
in
the
case
of
the
dolphin
with
entire
justice
to
the
contractor
an
agreement
has
been
entered
into
providing
for
the
ascertainment
by
a
judicial
inquiry
of
the
complete
or
partial
compliance
with
the
contract
in
her
construction
and
further
providing
for
the
assessment
of
any
damages
to
which
the
government
may
be
entitled
on
account
of
a
partial
failure
to
perform
such
contract
or
the
payment
of
the
sum
still
remaining
unpaid
upon
her
price
in
case
a
full
performance
is
adjudged
the
contractor
by
reason
of
his
failure
in
business
being
unable
to
complete
the
other
three
vessels
they
were
taken
possession
of
by
the
government
in
their
unfinished
state
under
a
clause
in
the
contract
permitting
such
a
course
and
are
now
in
process
of
completion
in
the
yard
of
the
contractor
but
under
the
supervision
of
the
navy
department
congress
at
its
last
session
authorized
the
construction
of
two
additional
new
cruisers
and
two
gunboats
at
a
cost
not
exceeding
in
the
aggregate
the
appropriation
for
this
purpose
having
become
available
on
the
st
day
of
july
last
steps
were
at
once
taken
for
the
procurement
of
such
plans
for
the
construction
of
these
vessels
as
would
be
likely
to
insure
their
usefulness
when
completed
these
are
of
the
utmost
importance
considering
the
constant
advance
in
the
art
of
building
vessels
of
this
character
and
the
time
is
not
lost
which
is
spent
in
their
careful
consideration
and
selection
all
must
admit
the
importance
of
an
effective
navy
to
a
nation
like
ours
having
such
an
extended
seacoast
to
protect
and
yet
we
have
not
a
single
vessel
of
war
that
could
keep
the
seas
against
a
firstclass
vessel
of
any
important
power
such
a
condition
ought
not
longer
to
continue
the
nation
that
can
not
resist
aggression
is
constantly
exposed
to
it
its
foreign
policy
is
of
necessity
weak
and
its
negotiations
are
conducted
with
disadvantage
because
it
is
not
in
condition
to
enforce
the
terms
dictated
by
its
sense
of
right
and
justice
inspired
as
i
am
by
the
hope
shared
by
all
patriotic
citizens
that
the
day
is
not
very
far
distant
when
our
navy
will
be
such
as
befits
our
standing
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
rejoiced
at
every
step
that
leads
in
the
direction
of
such
a
consummation
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
especially
direct
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
close
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
which
the
humiliating
weakness
of
the
present
organization
of
his
department
is
exhibited
and
the
startling
abuses
and
waste
of
its
present
methods
are
exposed
the
conviction
is
forced
upon
us
with
the
certainty
of
mathematical
demonstration
that
before
we
proceed
further
in
the
restoration
of
a
navy
we
need
a
thoroughly
reorganized
navy
department
the
fact
that
within
seventeen
years
more
than
have
been
spent
in
the
construction
repair
equipment
and
armament
of
vessels
and
the
further
fact
that
instead
of
an
effective
and
creditable
fleet
we
have
only
the
discontent
and
apprehension
of
a
nation
undefended
by
war
vessels
added
to
the
disclosures
now
made
do
not
permit
us
to
doubt
that
every
attempt
to
revive
our
navy
has
thus
far
for
the
most
part
been
misdirected
and
all
our
efforts
in
that
direction
have
been
little
better
than
blind
gropings
and
expensive
aimless
follies
unquestionably
if
we
are
content
with
the
maintenance
of
a
navy
department
simply
as
a
shabby
ornament
to
the
government
a
constant
watchfulness
may
prevent
some
of
the
scandal
and
abuse
which
have
found
their
way
into
our
present
organization
and
its
incurable
waste
may
be
reduced
to
the
minimum
but
if
we
desire
to
build
ships
for
present
usefulness
instead
of
naval
reminders
of
the
days
that
are
past
we
must
have
a
department
organized
for
the
work
supplied
with
all
the
talent
and
ingenuity
our
country
affords
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
the
experience
of
other
nations
systematized
so
that
all
effort
shall
unite
and
lead
in
one
direction
and
fully
imbued
with
the
conviction
that
war
vessels
though
new
are
useless
unless
they
combine
all
that
the
ingenuity
of
man
has
up
to
this
day
brought
forth
relating
to
their
construction
i
earnestly
commend
the
portion
of
the
secretarys
report
devoted
to
this
subject
to
the
attention
of
congress
in
the
hope
that
his
suggestions
touching
the
reorganization
of
his
department
may
be
adopted
as
the
first
step
toward
the
reconstruction
of
our
navy
the
affairs
of
the
postal
service
are
exhibited
by
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
which
will
be
laid
before
you
the
postal
revenue
whose
ratio
of
gain
upon
the
rising
prosperity
of
and
outstripped
the
increasing
expenses
of
our
growing
service
was
checked
by
the
reduction
in
the
rate
of
letter
postage
which
took
effect
with
the
beginning
of
october
in
the
latter
year
and
it
diminished
during
the
two
past
fiscal
years
in
about
the
proportion
of
in
to
in
natural
growth
and
development
have
meantime
increased
expenditure
resulting
in
a
deficiency
in
the
revenue
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
department
of
five
and
a
quarter
million
dollars
for
the
year
and
eight
and
a
third
million
in
the
last
fiscal
year
the
anticipated
and
natural
revival
of
the
revenue
has
been
oppressed
and
retarded
by
the
unfavorable
business
condition
of
the
country
of
which
the
postal
service
is
a
faithful
indicator
the
gratifying
fact
is
shown
however
by
the
report
that
our
returning
prosperity
is
marked
by
a
gain
of
in
the
revenue
of
the
latter
half
of
the
last
year
over
the
corresponding
period
of
the
preceding
year
the
change
in
the
weight
of
firstclass
matter
which
may
be
carried
for
a
single
rate
of
postage
from
a
half
ounce
to
an
ounce
and
the
reduction
by
onehalf
of
the
rate
of
newspaper
postage
which
under
recent
legislation
began
with
the
current
year
will
operate
to
restrain
the
augmentation
of
receipts
which
otherwise
might
have
been
expected
to
such
a
degree
that
the
scale
of
expense
may
gain
upon
the
revenue
and
cause
an
increased
deficiency
to
be
shown
at
its
close
yet
after
no
long
period
of
reawakened
prosperity
by
proper
economy
it
is
confidently
anticipated
that
even
the
present
low
rates
now
as
favorable
as
any
country
affords
will
be
adequate
to
sustain
the
cost
of
the
service
the
operation
of
the
postoffice
department
is
for
the
convenience
and
benefit
of
the
people
and
the
method
by
which
they
pay
the
charges
of
this
useful
arm
of
their
public
service
so
that
it
be
just
and
impartial
is
of
less
importance
to
them
than
the
economical
expenditure
of
the
means
they
provide
for
its
maintenance
and
the
due
improvement
of
its
agencies
so
that
they
may
enjoy
its
highest
usefulness
a
proper
attention
has
been
directed
to
the
prevention
of
waste
or
extravagance
and
good
results
appear
from
the
report
to
have
already
been
accomplished
i
approve
the
recommendation
of
the
postmastergeneral
to
reduce
the
charges
on
domestic
money
orders
of
and
less
from
to
cents
this
change
will
materially
aid
those
of
our
people
who
most
of
all
avail
themselves
of
this
instrumentality
but
to
whom
the
element
of
cheapness
is
of
the
greatest
importance
with
this
reduction
the
system
would
still
remain
selfsupporting
the
freedelivery
system
has
been
extended
to
additional
cities
during
the
year
and
now
enjoy
its
conveniences
experience
has
commended
it
to
those
who
enjoy
its
benefits
and
further
enlargement
of
its
facilities
is
due
to
other
communities
to
which
it
is
adapted
in
the
cities
where
it
has
been
established
taken
together
the
local
postage
exceeds
its
maintenance
by
nearly
the
limit
to
which
this
system
is
now
confined
by
law
has
been
nearly
reached
and
the
reasons
given
justify
its
extension
which
is
proposed
it
was
decided
with
my
approbation
after
a
sufficient
examination
to
be
inexpedient
for
the
postoffice
department
to
contract
for
carrying
our
foreign
mails
under
the
additional
autho
rity
given
by
the
last
congress
the
amount
limited
was
inadequate
to
pay
all
within
the
purview
of
the
law
the
full
rate
of
cents
per
mile
and
it
would
have
been
unjust
and
unwise
to
have
given
it
to
some
and
denied
it
to
others
nor
could
contracts
have
been
let
under
the
law
to
all
at
a
rate
to
have
brought
the
aggregate
within
the
appropriation
without
such
practical
prearrangement
of
terms
as
would
have
violated
it
the
rate
of
sea
and
inland
postage
which
was
proffered
under
another
statute
clearly
appears
to
be
a
fair
compensation
for
the
desired
service
being
three
times
the
price
necessary
to
secure
transportation
by
other
vessels
upon
any
route
and
much
beyond
the
charges
made
to
private
persons
for
services
not
less
burdensome
some
of
the
steamship
companies
upon
the
refusal
of
the
postmastergeneral
to
attempt
by
the
means
provided
the
distribution
of
the
sum
appropriated
as
an
extra
compensation
withdrew
the
services
of
their
vessels
and
thereby
occasioned
slight
inconvenience
though
no
considerable
injury
the
mails
having
been
dispatched
by
other
means
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
policy
of
subsidizing
any
line
of
public
conveyance
or
travel
i
am
satisfied
that
it
should
not
be
done
under
cover
of
an
expenditure
incident
to
the
administration
of
a
department
nor
should
there
be
any
uncertainty
as
to
the
recipients
of
the
subsidy
or
any
discretion
left
to
an
executive
officer
as
to
its
distribution
if
such
gifts
of
the
public
money
are
to
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
any
enterprise
in
the
supposed
interest
of
the
public
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
amount
to
be
paid
and
the
beneficiary
might
better
be
determined
by
congress
than
in
any
other
way
the
international
congress
of
delegates
from
the
postal
union
countries
convened
at
lisbon
in
portugal
in
february
last
and
after
a
session
of
some
weeks
the
delegates
signed
a
convention
amendatory
of
the
present
postalunion
convention
in
some
particulars
designed
to
advance
its
purposes
this
additional
act
has
had
my
approval
and
will
be
laid
before
you
with
the
departmental
report
i
approve
the
recommendation
of
the
postmastergeneral
that
another
assistant
be
provided
for
his
department
i
invite
your
consideration
to
the
several
other
recommendations
contained
in
his
report
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
contains
a
history
of
the
conduct
of
the
department
of
justice
during
the
last
year
and
a
number
of
valuable
suggestions
as
to
needed
legislation
and
i
invite
your
careful
attention
to
the
same
the
condition
of
business
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
is
such
that
there
seems
to
be
an
imperative
necessity
for
remedial
legislation
on
the
subject
some
of
these
courts
are
so
overburdened
with
pending
causes
that
the
delays
in
determining
litigation
amount
often
to
a
denial
of
justice
among
the
plans
suggested
for
relief
is
one
submitted
by
the
attorneygeneral
its
main
features
are
the
transfer
of
all
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
courts
to
the
district
courts
and
an
increase
of
judges
for
the
latter
where
necessary
an
addition
of
judges
to
the
circuit
courts
and
constituting
them
exclusively
courts
of
appeal
and
reasonably
limiting
appeals
thereto
further
restrictions
of
the
right
to
remove
causes
from
the
state
to
federal
courts
permitting
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
from
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territories
only
in
the
same
cases
as
they
are
allowed
from
state
courts
and
guarding
against
an
unnecessary
number
of
appeals
from
the
circuit
courts
i
approve
the
plan
thus
outlined
and
recommend
the
legislation
necessary
for
its
application
to
our
judicial
system
the
present
mode
of
compensating
united
states
marshals
and
district
attorneys
should
in
my
opinion
be
changed
they
are
allowed
to
charge
against
the
government
certain
fees
for
services
their
income
being
measured
by
the
amount
of
such
fees
within
a
fixed
limit
as
to
their
annual
aggregate
this
is
a
direct
inducement
for
them
to
make
their
fees
in
criminal
cases
as
large
as
possible
in
an
effort
to
reach
the
maximum
sum
permitted
as
an
entirely
natural
consequence
unscrupulous
marshals
are
found
encouraging
frivolous
prosecutions
arresting
people
on
petty
charges
of
crime
and
transporting
them
to
distant
places
for
examination
and
trial
for
the
purpose
of
earning
mileage
and
other
fees
and
district
attorneys
uselessly
attend
criminal
examinations
far
from
their
places
of
residence
for
the
express
purpose
of
swelling
their
accounts
against
the
government
the
actual
expenses
incurred
in
these
transactions
are
also
charged
against
the
government
thus
the
rights
and
freedom
of
our
citizens
are
outraged
and
public
expenditures
increased
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
public
officers
pretexts
for
increasing
the
measure
of
their
compensation
i
think
marshals
and
district
attorneys
should
be
paid
salaries
adjusted
by
a
rule
which
will
make
them
commensurate
with
services
fairly
rendered
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
desire
to
suggest
the
advisability
if
it
be
found
not
obnoxious
to
constitutional
objection
of
investing
united
states
commissioners
with
the
power
to
try
and
determine
certain
violations
of
law
within
the
grade
of
misdemeanors
such
trials
might
be
made
to
depend
upon
the
option
of
the
accused
the
multiplication
of
small
and
technical
offenses
especially
under
the
provisions
of
our
internalrevenue
law
render
some
change
in
our
present
system
very
desirable
in
the
interests
of
humanity
as
well
as
economy
the
district
courts
are
now
crowded
with
petty
prosecutions
involving
a
punishment
in
case
of
conviction
of
only
a
slight
fine
while
the
parties
accused
are
harassed
by
an
enforced
attendance
upon
courts
held
hundreds
of
miles
from
their
homes
if
poor
and
friendless
they
are
obliged
to
remain
in
jail
during
months
perhaps
that
elapse
before
a
session
of
the
court
is
held
and
are
finally
brought
to
trial
surrounded
by
strangers
and
with
but
little
real
opportunity
for
defense
in
the
meantime
frequently
the
marshal
has
charged
against
the
government
his
fees
for
an
arrest
the
transportation
of
the
accused
and
the
expense
of
the
same
and
for
summoning
witnesses
before
a
commissioner
a
grand
jury
and
a
court
the
witnesses
have
been
paid
from
the
public
funds
large
fees
and
traveling
expenses
and
the
commissioner
and
district
attorney
have
also
made
their
charges
against
the
government
this
abuse
in
the
administration
of
our
criminal
law
should
be
remedied
and
if
the
plan
above
suggested
is
not
practicable
some
other
should
be
devised
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
containing
an
account
of
the
operations
of
this
important
department
and
much
interesting
information
will
be
submitted
for
your
consideration
the
most
intricate
and
difficult
subject
in
charge
of
this
department
is
the
treatment
and
management
of
the
indians
i
am
satisfied
that
some
progress
may
be
noted
in
their
condition
as
a
result
of
a
prudent
administration
of
the
present
laws
and
regulations
for
their
control
but
it
is
submitted
that
there
is
lack
of
a
fixed
purpose
or
policy
on
this
subject
which
should
be
supplied
it
is
useless
to
dilate
upon
the
wrongs
of
the
indians
and
as
useless
to
indulge
in
the
heartless
belief
that
because
their
wrongs
are
revenged
in
their
own
atrocious
manner
therefore
they
should
be
exterminated
they
are
within
the
care
of
our
government
and
their
rights
are
or
should
be
protected
from
invasion
by
the
most
solemn
obligations
they
are
properly
enough
called
the
wards
of
the
government
and
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
guardianship
involves
on
our
part
efforts
for
the
improvement
of
their
condition
and
the
enforcement
of
their
rights
there
seems
to
be
general
concurrence
in
the
proposition
that
the
ultimate
object
of
their
treatment
should
be
their
civilization
and
citizenship
fitted
by
these
to
keep
pace
in
the
march
of
progress
with
the
advanced
civilization
about
them
they
will
readily
assimilate
with
the
mass
of
our
population
assuming
the
responsibilities
and
receiving
the
protection
incident
to
this
condition
the
difficulty
appears
to
be
in
the
selection
of
the
means
to
be
at
present
employed
toward
the
attainment
of
this
result
our
indian
population
exclusive
of
those
in
alaska
is
reported
as
numbering
nearly
all
being
located
on
lands
set
apart
for
their
use
and
occupation
aggregating
over
acres
these
lands
are
included
in
the
boundaries
of
reservations
of
different
dimensions
scattered
in
states
and
territories
presenting
great
variations
in
climate
and
in
the
kind
and
quality
of
their
soils
among
the
indians
upon
these
several
reservations
there
exist
the
most
marked
differences
in
natural
traits
and
disposition
and
in
their
progress
toward
civilization
while
some
are
lazy
vicious
and
stupid
others
are
industrious
peaceful
and
intelligent
while
a
portion
of
them
are
selfsupporting
and
independent
and
have
so
far
advanced
in
civilization
that
they
make
their
own
laws
administered
through
officers
of
their
own
choice
and
educate
their
children
in
schools
of
their
own
establishment
and
maintenance
others
still
retain
in
squalor
and
dependence
almost
the
savagery
of
their
natural
state
in
dealing
with
this
question
the
desires
manifested
by
the
indians
should
not
be
ignored
here
again
we
find
a
great
diversity
with
some
the
tribal
relation
is
cherished
with
the
utmost
tenacity
while
its
hold
upon
others
is
considerably
relaxed
the
love
of
home
is
strong
with
all
and
yet
there
are
those
whose
attachment
to
a
particular
locality
is
by
no
means
unyielding
the
ownership
of
their
lands
in
severalty
is
much
desired
by
some
while
by
others
and
sometimes
among
the
most
civilized
such
a
distribution
would
be
bitterly
opposed
the
variation
of
their
wants
growing
out
of
and
connected
with
the
character
of
their
several
locations
should
be
regarded
some
are
upon
reservations
most
fit
for
grazing
but
without
flocks
or
herds
and
some
on
arable
land
have
no
agricultural
implements
while
some
of
the
reservations
are
double
the
size
necessary
to
mainta
in
the
number
of
indians
now
upon
them
in
a
few
cases
perhaps
they
should
be
enlarged
add
to
all
this
the
difference
in
the
administration
of
the
agencies
while
the
same
duties
are
devolved
upon
all
the
disposition
of
the
agents
and
the
manner
of
their
contact
with
the
indians
have
much
to
do
with
their
condition
and
welfare
the
agent
who
perfunctorily
performs
his
duty
and
slothfully
neglects
all
opportunity
to
advance
their
moral
and
physical
improvement
and
fails
to
inspire
them
with
a
desire
for
better
things
will
accomplish
nothing
in
the
direction
of
their
civilization
while
he
who
feels
the
burden
of
an
important
trust
and
has
an
interest
in
his
work
will
by
consistent
example
firm
yet
considerate
treatment
and
welldirected
aid
and
encouragement
constantly
lead
those
under
his
charge
toward
the
light
of
their
enfranchisement
the
history
of
all
the
progress
which
has
been
made
in
the
civilization
of
the
indian
i
think
will
disclose
the
fact
that
the
beginning
has
been
religious
teaching
followed
by
or
accompanying
secular
education
while
the
selfsacrificing
and
pious
men
and
women
who
have
aided
in
this
good
work
by
their
independent
endeavor
have
for
their
reward
the
beneficent
results
of
their
labor
and
the
consciousness
of
christian
duty
well
performed
their
valuable
services
should
be
fully
acknowledged
by
all
who
under
the
law
are
charged
with
the
control
and
management
of
our
indian
wards
what
has
been
said
indicates
that
in
the
present
condition
of
the
indians
no
attempt
should
be
made
to
apply
a
fixed
and
unyielding
plan
of
action
to
their
varied
and
varying
needs
and
circumstances
the
indian
bureau
burdened
as
it
is
with
their
general
oversight
and
with
the
details
of
the
establishment
can
hardly
possess
itself
of
the
minute
phases
of
the
particular
cases
needing
treatment
and
thus
the
propriety
of
creating
an
instrumentality
auxiliary
to
those
already
established
for
the
care
of
the
indians
suggests
itself
i
recommend
the
passage
of
a
law
authorizing
the
appointment
of
six
commissioners
three
of
whom
shall
be
detailed
from
the
army
to
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
a
careful
inspection
from
time
to
time
of
all
the
indians
upon
our
reservations
or
subject
to
the
care
and
control
of
the
government
with
a
view
of
discovering
their
exact
condition
and
needs
and
determining
what
steps
shall
be
taken
on
behalf
of
the
government
to
improve
their
situation
in
the
direction
of
their
selfsupport
and
complete
civilization
that
they
ascertain
from
such
inspection
what
if
any
of
the
reservations
may
be
reduced
in
area
and
in
such
cases
what
part
not
needed
for
indian
occupation
may
be
purchased
by
the
government
from
the
indians
and
disposed
of
for
their
benefit
what
if
any
indians
may
with
their
consent
be
removed
to
other
reservations
with
a
view
of
their
concentration
and
the
sale
on
their
behalf
of
their
abandoned
reservations
what
indian
lands
now
held
in
common
should
be
allotted
in
severalty
in
what
manner
and
to
what
extent
the
indians
upon
the
reservations
can
be
placed
under
the
protection
of
our
laws
and
subjected
to
their
penalties
and
which
if
any
indians
should
be
invested
with
the
right
of
citizenship
the
powers
and
functions
of
the
commissioners
in
regard
to
these
subjects
should
be
clearly
defined
though
they
should
in
conjunction
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
be
given
all
the
authority
to
deal
definitely
with
the
questions
presented
deemed
safe
and
consistent
they
should
be
also
charged
with
the
duty
of
ascertaining
the
indians
who
might
properly
be
furnished
with
implements
of
agriculture
and
of
what
kind
in
what
cases
the
support
of
the
government
should
be
withdrawn
where
the
present
plan
of
distributing
indian
supplies
should
be
changed
where
schools
may
be
established
and
where
discontinued
the
conduct
methods
and
fitness
of
agents
in
charge
of
reservations
the
extent
to
which
such
reservations
are
occupied
or
intruded
upon
by
unauthorized
persons
and
generally
all
matters
related
to
the
welfare
and
improvement
of
the
indian
they
should
advise
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
concerning
these
matters
of
detail
in
management
and
he
should
be
given
power
to
deal
with
them
fully
if
he
is
not
now
invested
with
such
power
this
plan
contemplates
the
selection
of
persons
for
commissioners
who
are
interested
in
the
indian
question
and
who
have
practical
ideas
upon
the
subject
of
their
treatment
the
expense
of
the
indian
bureau
during
the
last
fiscal
year
was
more
than
six
and
a
halt
million
dollars
i
believe
much
of
this
expenditure
might
be
saved
under
the
plan
proposed
that
its
economical
effects
would
be
increased
with
its
continuance
that
the
safety
of
our
frontier
settlers
would
be
subserved
under
its
operation
and
that
the
nation
would
be
saved
through
its
results
from
the
imputation
of
inhumanity
injustice
and
mismanagement
in
order
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
allotment
of
indian
lands
in
severalty
when
deemed
expedient
it
will
be
necessary
to
have
surveys
completed
of
the
reservations
and
i
hope
that
provision
will
be
made
for
the
prosecution
of
this
work
in
may
of
the
present
year
a
small
portion
of
the
chiricahua
apaches
on
the
white
mountain
reservation
in
arizona
left
the
reservation
and
committed
a
number
of
murders
and
depredations
upon
settlers
in
that
neighborhood
though
prompt
and
energetic
action
was
taken
by
the
military
the
renegades
eluded
capture
and
escaped
into
mexico
the
formation
of
the
country
through
which
these
indians
passed
their
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
same
the
speed
of
their
escape
and
the
manner
in
which
they
scattered
and
concealed
themselves
among
the
mountains
near
the
scene
of
their
outrages
put
our
soldiers
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
their
efforts
to
capture
them
though
the
expectation
is
still
entertained
that
they
will
be
ultimately
taken
and
punished
for
their
crimes
the
threatening
and
disorderly
conduct
of
the
cheyennes
in
the
indian
territory
early
last
summer
caused
considerable
alarm
and
uneasiness
investigation
proved
that
their
threatening
attitude
was
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
occupation
of
the
land
of
their
reservation
by
immense
herds
of
cattle
which
their
owners
claimed
were
rightfully
there
under
certain
leases
made
by
the
indians
such
occupation
appearing
upon
examination
to
be
unlawful
notwithstanding
these
leases
the
intruders
were
ordered
to
remove
with
their
cattle
from
the
lands
of
the
indians
by
executive
proclamation
the
enforcement
of
this
proclamation
had
the
effect
of
restoring
peace
and
order
among
the
indians
and
they
are
now
quiet
and
well
behaved
by
an
executive
order
issued
on
february
by
my
predecessor
a
portion
of
the
tract
of
country
in
the
territory
known
as
the
old
winnebago
and
crow
creek
reservations
was
directed
to
be
restored
to
the
public
domain
and
opened
to
settlement
under
the
land
laws
of
the
united
states
and
a
large
number
of
persons
entered
upon
those
lands
this
action
alarmed
the
sioux
indians
who
claimed
the
territory
as
belonging
to
their
reservation
under
the
treaty
of
this
claim
was
determined
after
careful
investigation
to
be
well
rounded
and
consequently
the
executive
order
referred
to
was
by
proclamation
of
april
declared
to
be
inoperative
and
of
no
effect
and
all
persons
upon
the
land
were
warned
to
leave
this
warning
has
been
substantially
complied
with
the
public
domain
had
its
origin
in
cessions
of
land
by
the
states
to
the
general
government
the
first
cession
was
made
by
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
largest
which
in
area
exceeded
all
the
others
by
the
state
of
virginia
the
territory
the
proprietorship
of
which
became
thus
vested
in
the
general
government
extended
from
the
western
line
of
pennsylvania
to
the
mississippi
river
these
patriotic
donations
of
the
states
were
encumbered
with
no
condition
except
that
they
should
the
held
and
used
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
united
states
by
purchase
with
the
common
fund
of
all
the
people
additions
were
made
to
this
domain
until
it
extended
to
the
northern
line
of
mexico
the
pacific
ocean
and
the
polar
sea
the
original
trust
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
united
states
attached
to
all
in
the
execution
of
that
trust
the
policy
of
many
homes
rather
than
large
estates
was
adopted
by
the
government
that
these
might
be
easily
obtained
and
be
the
abode
of
security
and
contentment
the
laws
for
their
acquisition
were
few
easily
understood
and
general
in
their
character
but
the
pressure
of
local
interests
combined
with
a
speculative
spirit
have
in
many
instances
procured
the
passage
of
laws
which
marred
the
harmony
of
the
general
plan
and
encumbered
the
system
with
a
multitude
of
general
and
special
enactments
which
render
the
land
laws
complicated
subject
the
titles
to
uncertainty
and
the
purchasers
often
to
oppression
and
wrong
laws
which
were
intended
for
the
common
benefit
have
been
perverted
so
that
large
quantities
of
land
are
vesting
in
single
ownerships
from
the
multitude
and
character
of
the
laws
this
consequence
seems
incapable
of
correction
by
mere
administration
it
is
not
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
united
states
that
a
large
area
of
the
public
lands
should
be
acquired
directly
or
through
fraud
in
the
hands
of
a
single
individual
the
nations
strength
is
in
the
people
the
nations
prosperity
is
in
their
prosperity
the
nations
glory
is
in
the
equality
of
her
justice
the
nations
perpetuity
is
in
the
patriotism
of
all
her
people
hence
as
far
as
practicable
the
plan
adopted
in
the
disposal
of
the
public
lands
should
have
in
view
the
original
policy
which
encouraged
many
purchases
of
these
lands
for
homes
and
discouraged
the
massing
of
large
areas
exclusive
of
alaska
about
threefifths
of
the
national
domain
has
been
sold
or
subjected
to
contract
or
grant
of
the
remaining
twofifths
a
considerable
portion
is
either
mountain
or
desert
a
rapidly
increasing
population
creates
a
growing
demand
for
homes
and
the
accumulation
of
wealth
inspires
an
eager
competition
to
obtain
the
public
land
for
speculative
purposes
in
the
future
this
collision
o
f
interests
will
be
more
marked
than
in
the
past
and
the
execution
of
the
nations
trust
in
behalf
of
our
settlers
will
be
more
difficult
i
therefore
commend
to
your
attention
the
recommendations
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
with
reference
to
the
repeal
and
modification
of
certain
of
our
land
laws
the
nation
has
made
princely
grants
and
subsidies
to
a
system
of
railroads
projected
as
great
national
highways
to
connect
the
pacific
states
with
the
east
it
has
been
charged
that
these
donations
from
the
people
have
been
diverted
to
private
gain
and
corrupt
uses
and
thus
public
indignation
has
been
aroused
and
suspicion
engendered
our
great
nation
does
not
begrudge
its
generosity
but
it
abhors
speculation
and
fraud
and
the
favorable
regard
of
our
people
for
the
great
corporations
to
which
these
grants
were
made
can
only
be
revived
by
a
restoration
of
confidence
to
be
secured
by
their
constant
unequivocal
and
clearly
manifested
integrity
a
faithful
application
of
the
undiminished
proceeds
of
the
grants
to
the
construction
and
perfecting
of
their
roads
an
honest
discharge
of
their
obligations
and
entire
justice
to
all
the
people
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
rights
on
these
highways
of
travel
are
all
the
public
asks
and
it
will
be
content
with
no
less
to
secure
these
things
should
be
the
common
purpose
of
the
officers
of
the
government
as
well
as
of
the
corporations
with
this
accomplishment
prosperity
would
be
permanently
secured
to
the
roads
and
national
pride
would
take
the
place
of
national
complaint
it
appears
from
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
pensions
that
there
were
on
the
st
day
of
july
persons
borne
upon
the
pension
rolls
who
were
classified
as
follows
army
invalids
widows
minor
children
and
dependent
relatives
of
deceased
soldiers
navy
invalids
navy
widows
minor
children
and
dependents
survivors
of
the
war
of
and
widows
of
those
who
served
in
that
war
about
one
man
in
ten
of
all
those
who
enlisted
in
the
late
war
are
reported
as
receiving
pensions
exclusive
of
the
dependents
of
deceased
soldiers
on
the
st
of
july
the
number
of
pensioners
was
and
the
increase
within
the
ten
years
next
thereafter
was
while
there
is
no
expenditure
of
the
public
funds
which
the
people
more
cheerfully
approve
than
that
made
in
recognition
of
the
services
of
our
soldiers
living
and
dead
the
sentiment
underlying
the
subject
should
not
be
vitiated
by
the
introduction
of
any
fraudulent
practices
therefore
it
is
fully
as
important
that
the
rolls
should
be
cleansed
of
all
those
who
by
fraud
have
secured
a
place
thereon
as
that
meritorious
claims
should
be
speedily
examined
and
adjusted
the
reforms
in
the
methods
of
doing
the
business
of
this
bureau
which
have
lately
been
inaugurated
promise
better
results
in
both
these
directions
the
operations
of
the
patent
office
demonstrate
the
activity
of
the
inventive
genius
of
the
country
for
the
year
ended
june
the
applications
for
patents
including
reissues
and
for
the
registration
of
trademarks
and
labels
numbered
during
the
same
period
there
were
patents
granted
and
reissued
and
trademarks
and
labels
registered
the
number
of
patents
issued
in
the
year
was
the
receipts
during
the
last
fiscal
year
were
and
the
total
expenditures
not
including
contingent
expenses
there
were
applications
for
patents
pending
on
the
st
day
of
july
and
on
the
same
date
in
the
year
there
has
been
considerable
improvement
made
in
the
prompt
determination
of
applications
and
a
consequent
relief
to
expectant
inventors
a
number
of
suggestions
and
recommendations
are
contained
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
patents
which
are
well
entitled
to
the
consideration
of
congress
in
the
territory
of
utah
the
law
of
the
united
states
passed
for
the
suppression
of
polygamy
has
been
energetically
and
faithfully
executed
during
the
past
year
with
measurably
good
results
a
number
of
convictions
have
been
secured
for
unlawful
cohabitation
and
in
some
cases
pleas
of
guilty
have
been
entered
and
a
slight
punishment
imposed
upon
a
promise
by
the
accused
that
they
would
not
again
offend
against
the
law
nor
advise
counsel
aid
or
abet
in
any
way
its
violation
by
others
the
utah
commissioners
express
the
opinion
based
upon
such
information
as
they
are
able
to
obtain
that
but
few
polygamous
marriages
have
taken
place
in
the
territory
during
the
last
year
they
further
report
that
while
there
can
not
be
found
upon
the
registration
lists
of
voters
the
name
of
a
man
actually
guilty
of
polygamy
and
while
none
of
that
class
are
holding
office
yet
at
the
last
election
in
the
territory
all
the
officers
elected
except
in
one
county
were
men
who
though
not
actually
living
in
the
practice
of
polygamy
subscribe
to
the
doctrine
of
polygamous
marriages
as
a
divine
revelation
and
a
law
unto
all
higher
and
more
binding
upon
the
conscience
than
any
human
law
local
or
national
thus
is
the
strange
spectacle
presented
of
a
community
protected
by
a
republican
form
of
government
to
which
they
owe
allegiance
sustaining
by
their
suffrages
a
principle
and
a
belief
which
set
at
naught
that
obligation
of
absolute
obedience
to
the
law
of
the
land
which
lies
at
the
foundation
of
republican
institutions
the
strength
the
perpetuity
and
the
destiny
of
the
nation
rest
upon
our
homes
established
by
the
law
of
god
guarded
by
parental
care
regulated
by
parental
authority
and
sanctified
by
parental
love
these
are
not
the
homes
of
polygamy
the
mothers
of
our
land
who
rule
the
nation
as
they
mold
the
characters
and
guide
the
actions
of
their
sons
live
according
to
gods
holy
ordinances
and
each
secure
and
happy
in
the
exclusive
love
of
the
father
of
her
children
sheds
the
warm
light
of
true
womanhood
unperverted
and
unpolluted
upon
all
within
her
pure
and
wholesome
family
circle
these
are
not
the
cheerless
crushed
and
unwomanly
mothers
of
polygamy
the
fathers
of
our
families
are
the
best
citizens
of
the
republic
wife
and
children
are
the
sources
of
patriotism
and
conjugal
and
parental
affection
beget
devotion
to
the
country
the
man
who
undefiled
with
plural
marriage
is
surrounded
in
his
single
home
with
his
wife
and
children
has
a
stake
in
the
country
which
inspires
him
with
respect
for
its
laws
and
courage
for
its
defense
these
are
not
the
fathers
of
polygamous
families
there
is
no
feature
of
this
practice
or
the
system
which
sanctions
it
which
is
not
opposed
to
all
that
is
of
value
in
our
institutions
there
should
be
no
relaxation
in
the
firm
but
just
execution
of
the
law
now
in
operation
and
i
should
be
glad
to
approve
such
further
discreet
legislation
as
will
rid
the
country
of
this
blot
upon
its
fair
fame
since
the
people
upholding
polygamy
in
our
territories
are
reenforced
by
immigration
from
other
lands
i
recommend
that
a
law
be
passed
to
prevent
the
importation
of
mormons
into
the
country
the
agricultural
interest
of
the
country
demands
just
recognition
and
liberal
encouragement
it
sustains
with
certainty
and
unfailing
strength
our
nations
prosperity
by
the
products
of
its
steady
toil
and
bears
its
full
share
of
the
burden
of
taxation
without
complaint
our
agriculturists
have
but
slight
personal
representation
in
the
councils
of
the
nation
and
are
generally
content
with
the
humbler
duties
of
citizenship
and
willing
to
trust
to
the
bounty
of
nature
for
a
reward
of
their
labor
but
the
magnitude
and
value
of
this
industry
are
appreciated
when
the
statement
is
made
that
of
our
total
annual
exports
more
than
threefourths
are
the
products
of
agriculture
and
of
our
total
population
nearly
onehalf
are
exclusively
engaged
in
that
occupation
the
department
of
agriculture
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
and
diffusing
among
the
people
useful
information
respecting
the
subjects
it
has
in
charge
and
aiding
in
the
cause
of
intelligent
and
progressive
farming
by
the
collection
of
statistics
by
testing
the
value
and
usefulness
of
new
seeds
and
plants
and
distributing
such
as
are
found
desirable
among
agriculturists
this
and
other
powers
and
duties
with
which
this
department
is
invested
are
of
the
utmost
importance
and
if
wisely
exercised
must
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
country
the
aim
of
our
beneficent
government
is
the
improvement
of
the
people
in
every
station
and
the
amelioration
of
their
condition
surely
our
agriculturists
should
not
be
neglected
the
instrumentality
established
in
aid
of
the
farmers
of
the
land
should
not
only
be
well
equipped
for
the
accomplishment
of
its
purpose
but
those
for
whose
benefit
it
has
been
adopted
should
be
encouraged
to
avail
themselves
fully
of
its
advantages
the
prohibition
of
the
importation
into
several
countries
of
certain
of
our
animals
and
their
products
based
upon
the
suspicion
that
health
is
endangered
in
their
use
and
consumption
suggests
the
importance
of
such
precautions
for
the
protection
of
our
stock
of
all
kinds
against
disease
as
will
disarm
suspicion
of
danger
and
cause
the
removal
of
such
an
injurious
prohibition
if
the
laws
now
in
operation
are
insufficient
to
accomplish
this
protection
i
recommend
their
amendment
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
situation
and
i
commend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
suggestions
contained
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
calculated
to
increase
the
value
and
efficiency
of
this
department
the
report
of
the
civil
service
commission
which
will
be
submitted
contains
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
civilservice
law
has
been
executed
during
the
last
year
and
much
valuable
information
on
this
important
subject
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
is
no
sentiment
more
general
in
the
minds
of
the
people
of
our
country
than
a
conviction
of
the
correctness
of
the
principle
upon
which
the
law
enforcing
civilservice
reform
is
based
in
its
present
condition
the
law
regulates
only
a
part
of
the
subordinate
public
positions
throughout
the
country
it
applies
the
test
of
fitness
to
applicants
for
these
places
by
means
of
a
competitive
examination
and
gives
large
discretion
to
the
commissioners
as
to
the
character
of
the
examination
and
many
other
matters
co
nnected
with
its
execution
thus
the
rules
and
regulations
adopted
by
the
commission
have
much
to
do
with
the
practical
usefulness
of
the
statute
and
with
the
results
of
its
application
the
people
may
well
trust
the
commission
to
execute
the
law
with
perfect
fairness
and
with
as
little
irritation
as
is
possible
but
of
course
no
relaxation
of
the
principle
which
underlies
it
and
no
weakening
of
the
safeguards
which
surround
it
can
be
expected
experience
in
its
administration
will
probably
suggest
amendment
of
the
methods
of
its
execution
but
i
venture
to
hope
that
we
shall
never
again
be
remitted
to
the
system
which
distributes
public
positions
purely
as
rewards
for
partisan
service
doubts
may
well
be
entertained
whether
our
government
could
survive
the
strain
of
a
continuance
of
this
system
which
upon
every
change
of
administration
inspires
an
immense
army
of
claimants
for
office
to
lay
siege
to
the
patronage
of
government
engrossing
the
time
of
public
officers
with
their
importunities
spreading
abroad
the
contagion
of
their
disappointment
and
filling
the
air
with
the
tumult
of
their
discontent
the
allurements
of
an
immense
number
of
offices
and
places
exhibited
to
the
voters
of
the
land
and
the
promise
of
their
bestowal
in
recognition
of
partisan
activity
debauch
the
suffrage
and
rob
political
action
of
its
thoughtful
and
deliberative
character
the
evil
would
increase
with
the
multiplication
of
offices
consequent
upon
our
extension
and
the
mania
for
office
holding
growing
from
its
indulgence
would
pervade
our
population
so
generally
that
patriotic
purpose
the
support
of
principle
the
desire
for
the
public
good
and
solicitude
for
the
nations
welfare
would
be
nearly
banished
from
the
activity
of
our
party
contests
and
cause
them
to
degenerate
into
ignoble
selfish
and
disgraceful
struggles
for
the
possession
of
office
and
public
place
civilservice
reform
enforced
by
law
came
none
too
soon
to
check
the
progress
of
demoralization
one
of
its
effects
not
enough
regarded
is
the
freedom
it
brings
to
the
political
action
of
those
conservative
and
sober
men
who
in
fear
of
the
confusion
and
risk
attending
an
arbitrary
and
sudden
change
in
all
the
public
offices
with
a
change
of
party
rule
cast
their
ballots
against
such
a
chance
parties
seem
to
be
necessary
and
will
long
continue
to
exist
nor
can
it
be
now
denied
that
there
are
legitimate
advantages
not
disconnected
with
office
holding
which
follow
party
supremacy
while
partisanship
continues
bitter
and
pronounced
and
supplies
so
much
of
motive
to
sentiment
and
action
it
is
not
fair
to
hold
public
officials
in
charge
of
important
trusts
responsible
for
the
best
results
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
and
yet
insist
that
they
shall
rely
in
confidential
and
important
places
upon
the
work
of
those
not
only
opposed
to
them
in
political
affiliation
but
so
steeped
in
partisan
prejudice
and
rancor
that
they
have
no
loyalty
to
their
chiefs
and
no
desire
for
their
success
civilservice
reform
does
not
exact
this
nor
does
it
require
that
those
in
subordinate
positions
who
fail
in
yielding
their
best
service
or
who
are
incompetent
should
be
retained
simply
because
they
are
in
place
the
whining
of
a
clerk
discharged
for
indolence
or
incompetency
who
though
he
gained
his
place
by
the
worst
possible
operation
of
the
spoils
system
suddenly
discovers
that
he
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
sanction
of
civilservice
reform
represents
an
idea
no
less
absurd
than
the
clamor
of
the
applicant
who
claims
the
vacant
position
as
his
compensation
for
the
most
questionable
party
work
the
civilservice
law
does
not
prevent
the
discharge
of
the
indolent
or
incompetent
clerk
but
it
does
prevent
supplying
his
place
with
the
unfit
party
worker
thus
in
both
these
phases
is
seen
benefit
to
the
public
service
and
the
people
who
desire
good
government
having
secured
this
statute
will
not
relinquish
its
benefits
without
protest
nor
are
they
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
its
full
advantages
can
only
be
gained
through
the
complete
good
faith
of
those
having
its
execution
in
charge
and
this
they
will
insist
upon
i
recommend
that
the
salaries
of
the
civil
service
commissioners
be
increased
to
a
sum
more
nearly
commensurate
to
their
important
duties
it
is
a
source
of
considerable
and
not
unnatural
discontent
that
no
adequate
provision
has
yet
been
made
for
accommodating
the
principal
library
of
the
government
of
the
vast
collection
of
books
and
pamphlets
gathered
at
the
capitol
numbering
some
exclusive
of
manuscripts
maps
and
the
products
of
the
graphic
arts
also
of
great
volume
and
value
only
about
volumes
or
less
than
half
the
collection
are
provided
with
shelf
room
the
others
which
are
increasing
at
the
rate
of
from
twentyfive
to
thirty
thousand
volumes
a
year
are
not
only
inaccessible
to
the
public
but
are
subject
to
serious
damage
and
deterioration
from
other
causes
in
their
present
situation
a
consideration
of
the
facts
that
the
library
of
the
capitol
has
twice
been
destroyed
or
damaged
by
fire
its
daily
increasing
value
and
its
importance
as
a
place
of
deposit
of
books
under
the
law
relating
to
copyright
makes
manifest
the
necessity
of
prompt
action
to
insure
its
proper
accommodation
and
protection
my
attention
has
been
called
to
a
controversy
which
has
arisen
from
the
condition
of
the
law
relating
to
railroad
facilities
in
the
city
of
washington
which
has
involved
the
commissioners
of
the
district
in
much
annoyance
and
trouble
i
hope
this
difficulty
will
be
promptly
settled
by
appropriate
legislation
the
commissioners
represent
that
enough
of
the
revenues
of
the
district
are
now
on
deposit
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
repay
the
sum
advanced
by
the
government
for
sewer
improvements
under
the
act
of
june
they
desire
now
an
advance
of
the
share
which
ultimately
should
be
borne
by
the
district
of
the
cost
of
extensive
improvements
to
the
streets
of
the
city
the
total
expense
of
these
contemplated
improvements
is
estimated
at
and
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
a
considerable
sum
could
be
saved
if
they
had
all
the
money
in
hand
so
that
contracts
for
the
whole
work
could
be
made
at
the
same
time
they
express
confidence
that
if
the
advance
asked
for
should
be
made
the
government
would
be
reimbursed
the
same
within
a
reasonable
time
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
improvements
could
be
made
much
cheaper
if
undertaken
together
and
prosecuted
according
to
a
general
plan
the
license
law
now
in
force
within
the
district
is
deficient
and
uncertain
in
some
of
its
provisions
and
ought
to
be
amended
the
commissioners
urge
with
good
reason
the
necessity
of
providing
a
building
for
the
use
of
the
district
government
which
shall
better
secure
the
safety
and
preservation
of
its
valuable
books
and
records
the
present
condition
of
the
law
relating
to
the
succession
to
the
presidency
in
the
event
of
the
death
disability
or
removal
of
both
the
president
and
vicepresident
is
such
as
to
require
immediate
amendment
this
subject
has
repeatedly
been
considered
by
congress
but
no
result
has
been
reached
the
recent
lamentable
death
of
the
vicepresident
and
vacancies
at
the
same
time
in
all
other
offices
the
incumbents
of
which
might
immediately
exercise
the
functions
of
the
presidential
office
has
caused
public
anxiety
and
a
just
demand
that
a
recurrence
of
such
a
condition
of
affairs
should
not
be
permitted
in
conclusion
i
commend
to
the
wise
care
and
thoughtful
attention
of
congress
the
needs
the
welfare
and
the
aspirations
of
an
intelligent
and
generous
nation
to
subordinate
these
to
the
narrow
advantages
of
partisanship
or
the
accomplishment
of
selfish
aims
is
to
violate
the
peoples
trust
and
betray
the
peoples
interests
but
an
individual
sense
of
responsibility
on
the
part
of
each
of
us
and
a
stern
determination
to
perform
our
duty
well
must
give
us
place
among
those
who
have
added
in
their
day
and
generation
to
the
glory
and
prosperity
of
our
beloved
land

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
upon
the
reassembling
of
congress
it
again
becomes
my
duty
to
call
your
attention
to
the
state
of
the
union
and
to
its
continued
disorganized
condition
under
the
various
laws
which
have
been
passed
upon
the
subject
of
reconstruction
it
may
be
safely
assumed
as
an
axiom
in
the
government
of
states
that
the
greatest
wrongs
inflicted
upon
a
people
are
caused
by
unjust
and
arbitrary
legislation
or
by
the
unrelenting
decrees
of
despotic
rulers
and
that
the
timely
revocation
of
injurious
and
oppressive
measures
is
the
greatest
good
that
can
be
conferred
upon
a
nation
the
legislator
or
ruler
who
has
the
wisdom
and
magnanimity
to
retrace
his
steps
when
convinced
of
error
will
sooner
or
later
be
rewarded
with
the
respect
and
gratitude
of
an
intelligent
and
patriotic
people
our
own
history
although
embracing
a
period
less
than
a
century
affords
abundant
proof
that
most
if
not
all
of
our
domestic
troubles
are
directly
traceable
to
violations
of
the
organic
law
and
excessive
legislation
the
most
striking
illustrations
of
this
fact
are
furnished
by
the
enactments
of
the
past
three
years
upon
the
question
of
reconstruction
after
a
fair
trial
they
have
substantially
failed
and
proved
pernicious
in
their
results
and
there
seems
to
be
no
good
reason
why
they
should
longer
remain
upon
the
statute
book
states
to
which
the
constitution
guarantees
a
republican
form
of
government
have
been
reduced
to
military
dependencies
in
each
of
which
the
people
have
been
made
subject
to
the
arbitrary
will
of
the
commanding
general
although
the
constitution
requires
that
each
state
shall
be
represented
in
congress
virginia
mississippi
and
texas
are
yet
excluded
from
the
two
houses
and
contrary
to
the
express
provisions
of
that
instrument
were
denied
participation
in
the
recent
election
for
a
president
and
vicepresident
of
the
united
states
the
attempt
to
place
the
white
population
under
the
domination
of
persons
of
color
in
the
south
has
impaired
if
not
destroyed
the
kindly
relations
that
had
previously
existed
between
them
and
mutual
distrust
has
engendered
a
feeling
of
animosity
which
leading
in
some
instances
to
collision
and
bloodshed
has
prevented
that
cooperation
between
the
two
races
so
essential
to
the
success
of
industrial
enterprise
in
the
southern
states
nor
have
the
inhabitants
of
those
states
alone
suffered
from
the
disturbed
condition
of
affairs
growing
out
of
these
congressional
enactments
the
entire
union
has
been
agitated
by
grave
apprehensions
of
troubles
which
might
again
involve
the
peace
of
the
nation
its
interests
have
been
injuriously
affected
by
the
derangement
of
business
and
labor
and
the
consequent
want
of
prosperity
throughout
that
portion
of
the
country
the
federal
constitutionthe
magna
charta
of
american
rights
under
whose
wise
and
salutary
provisions
we
have
successfully
conducted
all
our
domestic
and
foreign
affairs
sustained
ourselves
in
peace
and
in
war
and
become
a
great
nation
among
the
powers
of
the
earthmust
assuredly
be
now
adequate
to
the
settlement
of
questions
growing
out
of
the
civil
war
waged
alone
for
its
vindication
this
great
fact
is
made
most
manifest
by
the
condition
of
the
country
when
congress
assembled
in
the
month
of
december
civil
strife
had
ceased
the
spirit
of
rebellion
had
spent
its
entire
force
in
the
southern
states
the
people
had
warmed
into
national
life
and
throughout
the
whole
country
a
healthy
reaction
in
public
sentiment
had
taken
place
by
the
application
of
the
simple
yet
effective
provisions
of
the
constitution
the
executive
department
with
the
voluntary
aid
of
the
states
had
brought
the
work
of
restoration
as
near
completion
as
was
within
the
scope
of
its
authority
and
the
nation
was
encouraged
by
the
prospect
of
an
early
and
satisfactory
adjustment
of
all
its
difficulties
congress
however
intervened
and
refusing
to
perfect
the
work
so
nearly
consummated
declined
to
admit
members
from
the
unrepresented
states
adopted
a
series
of
measures
which
arrested
the
progress
of
restoration
frustrated
all
that
had
been
so
successfully
accomplished
and
after
three
years
of
agitation
and
strife
has
left
the
country
further
from
the
attainment
of
union
and
fraternal
feeling
than
at
the
inception
of
the
congressional
plan
of
reconstruction
it
needs
no
argument
to
show
that
legislation
which
has
produced
such
baneful
consequences
should
be
abrogated
or
else
made
to
conform
to
the
genuine
principles
of
republican
government
under
the
influence
of
party
passion
and
sectional
prejudice
other
acts
have
been
passed
not
warranted
by
the
constitution
congress
has
already
been
made
familiar
with
my
views
respecting
the
tenureofoffice
bill
experience
has
proved
that
its
repeal
is
demanded
by
the
best
interests
of
the
country
and
that
while
it
remains
in
force
the
president
can
not
enjoin
that
rigid
accountability
of
public
officers
so
essential
to
an
honest
and
efficient
execution
of
the
laws
its
revocation
would
enable
the
executive
department
to
exercise
the
power
of
appointment
and
removal
in
accordance
with
the
original
design
of
the
federal
constitution
the
act
of
march
making
appropriations
for
the
support
of
the
army
for
the
year
ending
june
and
for
other
purposes
contains
provisions
which
interfere
with
the
presidents
constitutional
functions
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army
and
deny
to
states
of
the
union
the
right
to
protect
themselves
by
means
of
their
own
militia
these
provisions
should
be
at
once
annulled
for
while
the
first
might
in
times
of
great
emergency
seriously
embarrass
the
executive
in
efforts
to
employ
and
direct
the
common
strength
of
the
nation
for
its
protection
and
preservation
the
other
is
contrary
to
the
express
declaration
of
the
constitution
that
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
it
is
believed
that
the
repeal
of
all
such
laws
would
be
accepted
by
the
american
people
as
at
least
a
partial
return
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
government
and
an
indication
that
hereafter
the
constitution
is
to
be
made
the
nations
safe
and
unerring
guide
they
can
be
productive
of
no
permanent
benefit
to
the
country
and
should
not
be
permitted
to
stand
as
so
many
monuments
of
the
deficient
wisdom
which
has
characterized
our
recent
legislation
the
condition
of
our
finances
demands
the
early
and
earnest
consideration
of
congress
compared
with
the
growth
of
our
population
the
public
expenditures
have
reached
an
amount
unprecedented
in
our
history
the
population
of
the
united
states
in
was
nearly
people
increasing
each
decade
about
per
cent
it
reached
in
an
increase
of
per
cent
on
the
population
in
in
it
is
estimated
that
it
will
reach
or
an
increase
of
per
cent
in
seventynine
years
the
annual
expenditures
of
the
federal
government
in
were
in
in
fortyone
millions
in
sixtythree
millions
in
nearly
thirteen
hundred
millions
and
in
it
is
estimated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
last
annual
report
that
they
will
be
three
hundred
and
seventytwo
millions
by
comparing
the
public
disbursements
of
as
estimated
with
those
of
it
will
be
seen
that
the
increase
of
expenditure
since
the
beginning
of
the
government
has
been
per
cent
while
the
increase
of
the
population
for
the
same
period
was
only
per
cent
again
the
expenses
of
the
government
in
the
year
of
peace
immediately
preceding
the
war
were
only
sixtythree
millions
while
in
the
year
of
peace
three
years
after
the
war
it
is
estimated
they
will
be
three
hundred
and
seventytwo
millions
an
increase
of
per
cent
while
the
increase
of
population
was
only
per
cent
for
the
same
period
these
statistics
further
show
that
in
the
annual
national
expenses
compared
with
the
population
were
little
more
than
per
capita
and
in
but
per
capita
while
in
they
will
reach
the
extravagant
sum
of
per
capita
it
will
be
observed
that
all
these
statements
refer
to
and
exhibit
the
disbursements
of
peace
periods
it
may
therefore
be
of
interest
to
compare
the
expenditures
of
the
three
war
periodsthe
war
with
great
britain
the
mexican
war
and
the
war
of
the
rebellion
in
the
annual
expenses
incident
to
the
war
of
reached
their
highest
amountabout
thirtyone
millionswhile
our
population
slightly
exceeded
showing
an
expenditure
of
only
per
capita
in
the
expenditures
growing
out
of
the
war
with
mexico
reached
fiftyfive
millions
and
the
population
about
giving
only
per
capita
for
the
war
expenses
of
that
year
in
the
expenditures
called
for
by
the
rebellion
reached
the
vast
amount
of
twelve
hundred
and
ninety
millions
which
compared
with
a
population
of
gives
per
capita
from
the
th
day
of
march
to
the
th
of
june
the
entire
expenditures
of
the
government
were
during
that
period
we
were
engaged
in
wars
with
great
britain

if

can

attachment
and
respect
of

care
the
small
balance
which
it
is
estimated
will
remain
in

treasury
at
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
will
not
be
realized
and
additional
millions
be
added
to
a
debt
which
is
now
enumerated
by
billions
it
is
shown
by
the
able
and
comprehensive
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
the
receipts
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
were
and
that
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
leaving
in
the
treasury
a
surplus
of
it
is
estimated
that
the
receipts
during
the
present
fiscal
year
ending
june
will
be
and
the
expenditures
showing
a
small
balance
of
in
favor
of
the
government
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
it
is
estimated
that
the
receipts
will
amount
to
and
the
expenditures
to
leaving
an
estimated
surplus
of
it
becomes
proper
in
this
connection
to
make
a
brief
reference
to
our
public
indebtedness
which
has
accumulated
with
such
alarming
rapidity
and
assumed
such
colossal
proportions
in
when
the
government
commenced
operations
under
the
federal
constitution
it
was
burdened
with
an
indebtedness
of
created
during
the
war
of
the
revolution
this
amount
had
been
reduced
to
when
in
war
was
declared
against
great
britain
the
three
years
struggle
that
followed
largely
increased
the
national
obligations
and
in
they
had
attained
the
sum
of
wise
and
economical
legislation
however
enabled
the
government
to
pay
the
entire
amount
within
a
period
of
twenty
years
and
the
extinguishment
of
the
national
debt
filled
the
land
with
rejoicing
and
was
one
of
the
great
events
of
president
jacksons
administration
after
its
redemption
a
large
fund
remained
in
the
treasury
which
was
deposited
for
safekeeping
with
the
several
states
on
condition
that
it
should
be
returned
when
required
by
the
public
wants
in
the
year
after
the
termination
of
an
expensive
war
with
mexicowe
found
ourselves
involved
in
a
debt
of
and
this
was
the
amount
owed
by
the
government
in
just
prior
to
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
in
the
spring
of
our
civil
war
commenced
each
year
of
its
continuance
made
an
enormous
addition
to
the
debt
and
when
in
the
spring
of
the
nation
successfully
emerged
from
the
conflict
the
obligations
of
the
government
had
reached
the
immense
sum
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shows
that
on
the
st
day
of
november
this
amount
had
been
reduced
to
but
at
the
same
time
his
report
exhibits
an
increase
during
the
past
year
of
for
the
debt
on
the
st
day
of
november
last
is
stated
to
have
been
it
is
estimated
by
the
secretary
that
the
returns
for
the
past
month
will
add
to
our
liabilities
the
further
sum
of
making
a
total
increase
during
thirteen
months
of
in
my
message
to
congress
december
it
was
suggested
that
a
policy
should
be
devised
which
without
being
oppressive
to
the
people
would
at
once
begin
to
effect
a
reduction
of
the
debt
and
if
persisted
in
discharge
it
fully
within
a
definite
number
of
years
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
forcibly
recommends
legislation
of
this
character
and
justly
urges
that
the
longer
it
is
deferred
the
more
difficult
must
become
its
accomplishment
we
should
follow
the
wise
precedents
established
in
and
and
without
further
delay
make
provision
for
the
payment
of
our
obligations
at
as
early
a
period
as
may
be
practicable
the
fruits
of
their
labors
should
be
enjoyed
by
our
citizens
rather
than
used
to
build
up
and
sustain
moneyed
monopolies
in
our
own
and
other
lands
our
foreign
debt
is
already
computed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
at
citizens
of
foreign
countries
receive
interest
upon
a
large
portion
of
our
securities
and
american
taxpayers
are
made
to
contribute
large
sums
for
their
support
the
idea
that
such
a
debt
is
to
become
permanent
should
be
at
all
times
discarded
as
involving
taxation
too
heavy
to
be
borne
and
payment
once
in
every
sixteen
years
at
the
present
rate
of
interest
of
an
amount
equal
to
the
original
sum
this
vast
debt
if
permitted
to
become
permanent
and
increasing
must
eventually
be
gathered
into
the
hands
of
a
few
and
enable
them
to
exert
a
dangerous
and
controlling
power
in
the
affairs
of
the
government
the
borrowers
would
become
servants
to
the
lenders
the
lenders
the
masters
of
the
people
we
now
pride
ourselves
upon
having
given
freedom
to
of
the
colored
race
it
will
then
be
our
shame
that
of
people
by
their
own
toleration
of
usurpation
and
profligacy
have
suffered
themselves
to
become
enslaved
and
merely
exchanged
slave
owners
for
new
taskmasters
in
the
shape
of
bondholders
and
taxgatherers
besides
permanent
debts
pertain
to
monarchical
governments
and
tending
to
monopolies
perpetuities
and
class
legislation
are
totally
irreconcilable
with
free
institutions
introduced
into
our
republican
system
they
would
gradually
but
surely
sap
its
foundations
eventually
subvert
our
governmental
fabric
and
erect
upon
its
ruins
a
moneyed
aristocracy
it
is
our
sacred
duty
to
transmit
unimpaired
to
our
posterity
the
blessings
of
liberty
which
were
bequeathed
to
us
by
the
founders
of
the
republic
and
by
our
example
teach
those
who
are
to
follow
us
carefully
to
avoid
the
dangers
which
threaten
a
free
and
independent
people
various
plans
have
been
proposed
for
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
however
they
may
have
varied
as
to
the
time
and
mode
in
which
it
should
be
redeemed
there
seems
to
be
a
general
concurrence
as
to
the
propriety
and
justness
of
a
reduction
in
the
present
rate
of
interest
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
report
recommends
per
cent
congress
in
a
bill
passed
prior
to
adjournment
on
the
th
of
july
last
agreed
upon
and
per
cent
while
by
many
per
cent
has
been
held
to
be
an
amply
sufficient
return
for
the
investment
the
general
impression
as
to
the
exorbitancy
of
the
existing
rate
of
interest
has
led
to
an
inquiry
in
the
public
mind
respecting
the
consideration
which
the
government
has
actually
received
for
its
bonds
and
the
conclusion
is
becoming
prevalent
that
the
amount
which
it
obtained
was
in
real
money
three
or
four
hundred
per
cent
less
than
the
obligations
which
it
issued
in
return
it
can
not
be
denied
that
we
are
paying
an
extravagant
percentage
for
the
use
of
the
money
borrowed
which
was
paper
currency
greatly
depreciated
below
the
value
of
coin
this
fact
is
made
apparent
when
we
consider
that
bondholders
receive
from
the
treasury
upon
each
dollar
they
own
in
government
securities
per
cent
in
gold
which
is
nearly
or
quite
equal
to
per
cent
in
currency
that
the
bonds
are
then
converted
into
capital
for
the
national
banks
upon
which
those
institutions
issue
their
circulation
bearing
per
cent
interest
and
that
they
are
exempt
from
taxation
by
the
government
and
the
states
and
thereby
enhanced
per
cent
in
the
hands
of
the
holders
we
thus
have
an
aggregate
of
per
cent
which
may
be
received
upon
each
dollar
by
the
owners
of
government
securities
a
system
that
produces
such
results
is
justly
regarded
as
favoring
a
few
at
the
expense
of
the
many
and
has
led
to
the
further
inquiry
whether
our
bondholders
in
view
of
the
large
profits
which
they
have
enjoyed
would
themselves
be
averse
to
a
settlement
of
our
indebtedness
upon
a
plan
which
would
yield
them
a
fair
remuneration
and
at
the
same
time
be
just
to
the
taxpayers
of
the
nation
our
national
credit
should
be
sacredly
observed
but
in
making
provision
for
our
creditors
we
should
not
forget
what
is
due
to
the
masses
of
the
people
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
holders
of
our
securities
have
already
received
upon
their
bonds
a
larger
amount
than
their
original
investment
measured
by
a
gold
standard
upon
this
statement
of
facts
it
would
seem
but
just
and
equitable
that
the
per
cent
interest
now
paid
by
the
government
should
be
applied
to
the
reduction
of
the
principal
in
semiannual
installments
which
in
sixteen
years
and
eight
months
would
liquidate
the
entire
national
debt
six
per
cent
in
gold
would
at
present
rates
be
equal
to
per
cent
in
currency
and
equivalent
to
the
payment
of
the
debt
one
and
a
half
times
in
a
fraction
less
than
seventeen
years
this
in
connection
with
all
the
other
advantages
derived
from
their
investment
would
afford
to
the
public
creditors
a
fair
and
liberal
compensation
for
the
use
of
their
capital
and
with
this
they
should
be
satisfied
the
lessons
of
the
past
admonish
the
lender
that
it
is
not
well
to
be
overanxious
in
exacting
from
the
borrower
rigid
compliance
with
the
letter
of
the
bond
if
provision
be
made
for
the
payment
of
the
indebtedness
of
the
government
in
the
manner
suggested
our
nation
will
rapidly
recover
its
wonted
prosperity
its
interests
require
that
some
measure
should
be
taken
to
release
the
large
amount
of
capital
invested
in
the
securities
of
the
government
it
is
not
now
merely
unproductive
but
in
taxation
annually
consumes
which
would
otherwise
be
used
by
our
enterprising
people
in
adding
to
the
wealth
of
the
nation
our
commerce
which
at
one
time
successfully
riv
aled
that
of
the
great
maritime
powers
has
rapidly
diminished
and
our
industrial
interests
are
in
a
depressed
and
languishing
condition
the
development
of
our
inexhaustible
resources
is
checked
and
the
fertile
fields
of
the
south
are
becoming
waste
for
want
of
means
to
till
them
with
the
release
of
capital
new
life
would
be
infused
into
the
paralyzed
energies
of
our
people
and
activity
and
vigor
imparted
to
every
branch
of
industry
our
people
need
encouragement
in
their
efforts
to
recover
from
the
effects
of
the
rebellion
and
of
injudicious
legislation
and
it
should
be
the
aim
of
the
government
to
stimulate
them
by
the
prospect
of
an
early
release
from
the
burdens
which
impede
their
prosperity
if
we
can
not
take
the
burdens
from
their
shoulders
we
should
at
least
manifest
a
willingness
to
help
to
bear
them
in
referring
to
the
condition
of
the
circulating
medium
i
shall
merely
reiterate
substantially
that
portion
of
my
last
annual
message
which
relates
to
that
subject
the
proportion
which
the
currency
of
any
country
should
bear
to
the
whole
value
of
the
annual
produce
circulated
by
its
means
is
a
question
upon
which
political
economists
have
not
agreed
nor
can
it
be
controlled
by
legislation
but
must
be
left
to
the
irrevocable
laws
which
everywhere
regulate
commerce
and
trade
the
circulating
medium
will
ever
irresistibly
flow
to
those
points
where
it
is
in
greatest
demand
the
law
of
demand
and
supply
is
as
unerring
as
that
which
regulates
the
tides
of
the
ocean
and
indeed
currency
like
the
tides
has
its
ebbs
and
flows
throughout
the
commercial
world
at
the
beginning
of
the
rebellion
the
banknote
circulation
of
the
country
amounted
to
not
much
more
than
now
the
circulation
of
nationalbank
notes
and
those
known
as
legaltenders
is
nearly
seven
hundred
millions
while
it
is
urged
by
some
that
this
amount
should
be
increased
others
contend
that
a
decided
reduction
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
best
interests
of
the
country
in
view
of
these
diverse
opinions
it
may
be
well
to
ascertain
the
real
value
of
our
paper
issues
when
compared
with
a
metallic
or
convertible
currency
for
this
purpose
let
us
inquire
how
much
gold
and
silver
could
be
purchased
by
the
seven
hundred
millions
of
paper
money
now
in
circulation
probably
not
more
than
half
the
amount
of
the
latter
showing
that
when
our
paper
currency
is
compared
with
gold
and
silver
its
commercial
value
is
compressed
into
three
hundred
and
fifty
millions
this
striking
fact
makes
it
the
obvious
duty
of
the
government
as
early
as
may
be
consistent
with
the
principles
of
sound
political
economy
to
take
such
measures
as
will
enable
the
holders
of
its
notes
and
those
of
the
national
banks
to
convert
them
without
loss
into
specie
or
its
equivalent
a
reduction
of
our
paper
circulating
medium
need
not
necessarily
follow
this
however
would
depend
upon
the
law
of
demand
and
supply
though
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
by
making
legaltender
and
bank
notes
convertible
into
coin
or
its
equivalent
their
present
specie
value
in
the
hands
of
their
holders
would
be
enhanced
per
cent
legislation
for
the
accomplishment
of
a
result
so
desirable
is
demanded
by
the
highest
public
considerations
the
constitution
contemplates
that
the
circulating
medium
of
the
country
shall
be
uniform
in
quality
and
value
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
that
instrument
the
country
had
just
emerged
from
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
redundant
and
worthless
paper
currency
the
sages
of
that
period
were
anxious
to
protect
their
posterity
from
the
evils
which
they
themselves
had
experienced
hence
in
providing
a
circulating
medium
they
conferred
upon
congress
the
power
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
thereof
at
the
same
time
prohibiting
the
states
from
making
anything
but
gold
and
silver
a
tender
in
payment
of
debts
the
anomalous
condition
of
our
currency
is
in
striking
contrast
with
that
which
was
originally
designed
our
circulation
now
embraces
first
notes
of
the
national
banks
which
are
made
receivable
for
all
dues
to
the
government
excluding
imposts
and
by
all
its
creditors
excepting
in
payment
of
interest
upon
its
bonds
and
the
securities
themselves
second
legal
tender
issued
by
the
united
states
and
which
the
law
requires
shall
be
received
as
well
in
payment
of
all
debts
between
citizens
as
of
all
government
dues
excepting
imposts
and
third
gold
and
silver
coin
by
the
operation
of
our
present
system
of
finance
however
the
metallic
currency
when
collected
is
reserved
only
for
one
class
of
government
creditors
who
holding
its
bonds
semiannually
receive
their
interest
in
coin
from
the
national
treasury
there
is
no
reason
which
will
be
accepted
as
satisfactory
by

the

upon
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
bearing
the
scars
and
wounds
received
while
in
its
service
the
public
servants
in
the
various
departments
of

the

who
build
its

and
construct
its
forts
and
vessels
of

should
in
payment
of
their
just
and
hardearned
dues
receive
depreciated
paper
while
another
class
of
their
countrymen
no
more
deserving
are
paid
in

of
gold
and

equal
and
exact
justice
requires
that
all
the
creditors
of
the
government
should
be
paid
in
a
currency
possessing
a
uniform
value
this
can
only
be
accomplished
by
the
restoration
of
the
currency
to
the
standard
established
by
the
constitution
and
by
this
means
we
would
remove
a
discrimination
which
may
if
it
has
not
already
done
so
create
a
prejudice
that
may
become
deeprooted
and
widespread
and
imperil
the
national
credit
the
feasibility
of
making
our
currency
correspond
with
the
constitutional
standard
may
be
seen
by
reference
to
a
few
facts
derived
from
our
commercial
statistics
the
aggregate
product
of
precious
metals
in
the
united
states
from
to
amounted
to
while
for
the
same
period
the
net
exports
of
specie
were
this
shows
an
excess
of
product
over
net
exports
of
there
are
in
the
treasury
in
coin
in
circulation
in
the
states
on
the
pacific
coast
about
and
a
few
millions
in
the
national
and
other
banksin
all
less
than
taking
into
consideration
the
specie
in
the
country
prior
to
and
that
produced
since
and
we
have
more
than
not
accounted
for
by
exportation
or
by
returns
of
the
treasury
and
therefore
most
probably
remaining
in
the
country
these
are
important
facts
and
show
how
completely
the
inferior
currency
will
supersede
the
better
forcing
it
from
circulation
among
the
masses
and
causing
it
to
be
exported
as
a
mere
article
of
trade
to
add
to
the
money
capital
of
foreign
lands
they
show
the
necessity
of
retiring
our
paper
money
that
the
return
of
gold
and
silver
to
the
avenues
of
trade
may
be
invited
and
a
demand
created
which
will
cause
the
retention
at
home
of
at
least
so
much
of
the
productions
of
our
rich
and
inexhaustible
goldbearing
fields
as
may
be
sufficient
for
purposes
of
circulation
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
a
return
to
a
sound
currency
so
long
as
the
government
and
banks
by
continuing
to
issue
irredeemable
notes
fill
the
channels
of
circulation
with
depreciated
paper
notwithstanding
a
coinage
by
our
mints
since
of
the
people
are
now
strangers
to
the
currency
which
was
designed
for
their
use
and
benefit
and
specimens
of
the
precious
metals
bearing
the
national
device
are
seldom
seen
except
when
produced
to
gratify
the
interest
excited
by
their
novelty
if
depreciated
paper
is
to
be
continued
as
the
permanent
currency
of
the
country
and
all
our
coin
is
to
become
a
mere
article
of
traffic
and
speculation
to
the
enhancement
in
price
of
all
that
is
indispensable
to
the
comfort
of
the
people
it
would
be
wise
economy
to
abolish
our
mints
thus
saving
the
nation
the
care
and
expense
incident
to
such
establishments
and
let
our
precious
metals
be
exported
in
bullion
the
time
has
come
however
when
the
government
and
national
banks
should
be
required
to
take
the
most
efficient
steps
and
make
all
necessary
arrangements
for
a
resumption
of
specie
payments
let
specie
payments
once
be
earnestly
inaugurated
by
the
government
and
banks
and
the
value
of
the
paper
circulation
would
directly
approximate
a
specie
standard
specie
payments
having
been
resumed
by
the
government
and
banks
all
notes
or
bills
of
paper
issued
by
either
of
a
less
denomination
than
should
by
law
be
excluded
from
circulation
so
that
the
people
may
have
the
benefit
and
convenience
of
a
gold
and
silver
currency
which
in
all
their
business
transactions
will
be
uniform
in
value
at
home
and
abroad
every
man
of
property
or
industry
every
man
who
desires
to
preserve
what
he
honestly
possesses
or
to
obtain
what
he
can

one
of

the

where
they
may
be
encouraged
to
abandon
their

engage

this
policy
inaugurated
many
years
since
has
met
with
signal
success
whenever
it
has
been
pursued
in
good
faith
and
with
becoming
liberality
by
the
united

the
necessity
for
extending
it
as
far
as
practicable
in
our
relations
with
the
aboriginal
population
is
greater
now
than
at
any
preceding
period
whilst
we
furnish
subsistence
and
instruction
to
the
indians
and
guarantee
the
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
their
treaty
rights
we
should
habitually
insist
upon
the
faithful
observance
of
their
agreement
to
remain
within
their
respective
reservations
this
is
the
only
mode
by
which
collisions
with
other

and
with
the
whites
can
be
avoided
and
the
safety
of
our
frontier
settlements
secured
the
companies
constructing
the
railway
from
omaha
to
sacramento
have
been
most
energetically
engaged
in
prosecuting
the
work
and
it
is
believed
that
the
line
will
be
completed
before
the
expiration
of
the
next
fiscal

the
per

bonds
issued
to

amounted
on

additional
work

been
performed
to
the
extent
of
the
secretary
of

in

invited
my
attention
to
the
report
of
a
government
director
of
the
union
pacific
railroad
company
who
had
been
specially
instructed
to
examine
the
location
construction
and
equipment
of
their
road
i
submitted
for
the
opinion
of
the
attorneygeneral
certain
questions
in
regard
to
the
authority
of
the
executive
which
arose
upon
this
report
and
those
which
had
from
time
to
time
been
presented
by
the
commissioners
appointed
to
inspect
each
successive
section
of
the
work
after
carefully
considering
the
law
of
the
case
he
affirmed
the
right
of
the
executive
to
order
if
necessary
a
thorough
revision
of
the
entire
road
commissioners
were
thereupon
appointed
to
examine
this
and
other
lines
and
have
recently
submitted
a
statement
of
their
investigations
of
which
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
furnishes
specific
information
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
contains
information
of
interest
and
importance
respecting
the
several
bureaus
of
the
war
department
and
the
operations
of
the
army
the
strength
of
our
military
force
on
the
th
of
september
last
was
men
and
it
is
computed
that
by
the
st
of
january
next
this
number
will
be
decreased
to
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
within
the
next
year
a
considerable
diminution
of
the
infantry
force
may
be
made
without
detriment
to
the
interests
of
the
country
and
in
view
of
the
great
expense
attending
the
military
peace
establishment
and
the
absolute
necessity
of
retrenchment
wherever
it
can
be
applied
it
is
hoped
that
congress
will
sanction
the
reduction
which
his
report
recommends
while
in
sixteen
thousand
three
hundred

cost

nation
the
sum
of
is
estimated
as
necessary
for
the

of
the

the
estimates
of
the
war
department
for
the
last
two
fiscal
years
were
for
and
for
the
actual
expenditures
during
the
same
periods
were
respectively
and
the
estimate
submitted
in
december
last
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
was
the
expenditures
for
the
first
quarter
ending
the
th
of
september
last
were
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
gives
as
the
amount
which
will
probably
be
required
during
the
remaining
three
quarters
if
there
should
be
no
reduction
of
the
armymaking
its
aggregate
cost
for
the

considerably
in

of
ninetythree
millions
the
difference
between
the
estimates
and
expenditures
for
the
three
fiscal
years
which
have
been
named
is
thus
shown
to
be
for
this
single
branch
of
the
public

the

charles
a

late
united

minister
to
paraguay
having
resigned
and
being
desirous
to
return
to
the
united
states
the
rearadmiral
commanding
the
south
atlantic
squadron
was
early
directed
to
send
a
ship
of
war
to
asuncion
the
capital
of
paraguay
to
receive
mr
washburn
and
his
family
and
remove
them
from
a
situation
which
was
represented
to
be
endangered
by
faction
and
foreign
war
the
brazilian
commander
of
the
allied
invading
fo
rces
refused
permission
to
the
wasp
to
pass
through
the
blockading
forces
and
that
vessel
returned
to
its
accustomed
anchorage
remonstrance
having
been
made
against
this
refusal
it
was
promptly
overruled
and
the
wasp
therefore
resumed
her
errand
received
mr
washburn
and
his
family
and
conveyed
them
to
a
safe
and
convenient
seaport
in
the
meantime
an
excited
controversy
had
arisen
between
the
president
of
paraguay
and
the
late
united

minister
which
it
is
understood
grew
out
of
his
proceedings
in
giving
asylum
in
the
united
states
legation
to
alleged
enemies
of
that
republic
the
question
of
the
right
to
give
asylum
is
one
always
difficult
and
often
productive
of
great
embarrassment
in
states
well
organized
and
established
foreign
powers
refuse
either
to
concede
or
exercise
that
right
except

the
president

understood
to
have
opposed
to

the

reached

mr

in

with
this

represents
that
two

citizens
attached
to

were
arbitrarily
seized
at

side
when
leaving
the

the

with
these

friendly

between

our
relations
during
the
past
year
with
bolivia
ecuador
peru
and
chile
have
become
especially
friendly
and
cordial
spain
and
the
republics
of
peru
bolivia
and

have
expressed
their
willingness
to
accept
the
mediation
of
the
united
states
for
terminating
the
war
upon
the
south
pacific
coast
chile
has
not
finally
declared
upon
the
question
in
the
meantime
the
conflict
has
practically
exhausted
itself
since
no
belligerent
or
hostile
movement
has
been
made
by
either
party
during
the
last
two
years
and
there
are
no
indications
of
a
present
purpose
to
resume
hostilities
on
either
side
great
britain
and
france
have
cordially
seconded
our
proposition
of
mediation
and
i
do
not
forego
the
hope
that
it
may
soon
be
accepted
by
all
the
belligerents
and
lead
to
a
secure
establishment
of
peace
and
friendly
relations
between
the
spanish
american
republics
of
the
pacific
and
spaina
result
which
would
be
attended
with
common
benefits
to
the
belligerents
and
much
advantage
to
all
commercial
nations
i
communicate
for
the
consideration
of
congress
a
correspondence
which
shows
that
the
bolivian
republic
has
established
the
extremely
liberal
principle
of
receiving
into
its
citizenship
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
other
of
the
american
republics
upon
the
simple
condition
of
voluntary
registry
the
correspondence
herewith
submitted
will
be
found
painfully
replete
with
accounts
of
the
ruin
and
wretchedness
produced
by
recent
earthquakes
of
unparalleled
severity
in
the
republics
of
peru
ecuador
and
bolivia
the
diplomatic
agents
and
naval
officers
of
the
united
states
who
were
present
in
those
countries
at
the
time
of
those
disasters
furnished
all
the
relief
in
their
power
to
the
sufferers
and
were
promptly
rewarded
with
grateful
and
touching
acknowledgments
by
the
congress
of
peru
an
appeal
to
the
charity
of
our
fellowcitizens
has
been
answered
by
much
liberality
in
this
connection
i
submit
an
appeal
which
has
been
made
by
the
swiss
republic
whose
government
and
institutions
are
kindred
to
our
own
in
behalf
of
its
inhabitants
who
are
suffering
extreme
destitution
produced
by
recent
devastating
inundations
our
relations
with
mexico
during
the
year
have
been
marked
by
an
increasing
growth
of
mutual
confidence
the
mexican
government
has
not
yet
acted
upon
the
three
treaties
celebrated
here
last
summer
for
establishing
the
rights
of
naturalized
citizens
upon
a
liberal
and
just
basis
for
regulating
consular
powers
and
for
the
adjustment
of
mutual
claims
all
commercial
nations
as
well
as
all
friends
of
republican
institutions
have
occasion
to
regret
the
frequent
local
disturbances
which
occur
in
some
of
the
constituent
states
of
colombia
nothing
has
occurred
however
to
affect
the
harmony
and
cordial
friendship
which
have
for
several
years
existed
between
that
youthful
and
vigorous
republic
and
our
own
negotiations
are
pending
with
a
view
to
the
survey
and
construction
of
a
ship
canal
across
the
isthmus
of
darien
under
the
auspices
of
the
united
states
i
hope
to
be
able
to
submit
the
results
of
that
negotiation
to
the
senate
during
its
present
session
the
very
liberal
treaty
which
was
entered
into
last
year
by
the
united
states
and
nicaragua
has
been
ratified
by
the
latter
republic
costa
rica
with
the
earnestness
of
a
sincerely
friendly
neighbor
solicits
a
reciprocity
of
trade
which
i
commend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
convention
created
by
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
venezuela
in
july
for
the
mutual
adjustment
of
claims
has
been
held
and
its
decisions
have
been
received
at
the
department
of
state
the
heretoforerecognized
government
of
the
united
states
of
venezuela
has
been
subverted
a
provisional
government
having
been
instituted
under
circumstances
which
promise
durability
it
has
been
formally
recognized
i
have
been
reluctantly
obliged
to
ask
explanation
and
satisfaction
for
national
injuries
committed
by
the
president
of
hayti
the
political
and
social
condition
of
the
republics
of
hayti
and
st
domingo
is
very
unsatisfactory
and
painful
the
abolition
of
slavery
which
has
been
carried
into
effect
throughout
the
island
of
st
domingo
and
the
entire
west
indies
except
the
spanish
islands
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
has
been
followed
by
a
profound
popular
conviction
of
the
rightfulness
of
republican
institutions
and
an
intense
desire
to
secure
them
the
attempt
however
to
establish
republics
there
encounters
many
obstacles
most
of
which
may
be
supposed
to
result
from
longindulged
habits
of
colonial
supineness
and
dependence
upon
european
monarchical
powers
while
the
united
states
have
on
all
occasions
professed
a
decided
unwillingness
that
any
part
of
this
continent
or
of
its
adjacent
islands
shall
be
made
a
theater
for
a
new
establishment
of
monarchical
power
too
little
has
been
done
by
us
on
the
other
hand
to
attach
the
communities
by
which
we
are
surrounded
to
our
own
country
or
to
lend
even
a
moral
support
to
the
efforts
they
are
so
resolutely
and
so
constantly
making
to
secure
republican
institutions
for
themselves
it
is
indeed
a
question
of
grave
consideration
whether
our
recent
and
present
example
is
not
calculated
to
check
the
growth
and
expansion
of
free
principles
and
make
those
communities
distrust
if
not
dread
a
government
which
at
will
consigns
to
military
domination
states
that
are
integral
parts
of
our
federal
union
and
while
ready
to
resist
any
attempts
by
other
nations
to
extend
to
this
hemisphere
the
monarchical
institutions
of
europe
assumes
to
establish
over
a
large
portion
of
its
people
a
rule
more
absolute
harsh
and
tyrannical
than
any
known
to
civilized
powers
the
acquisition
of
alaska
was
made
with
the
view
of
extending
national
jurisdiction
and
republican
principles
in
the
american
hemisphere
believing
that
a
further
step
could
be
taken
in
the
same
direction
i
last
year
entered
into
a
treaty
with
the
king
of
denmark
for
the
purchase
of
the
islands
of
st
thomas
and
st
john
on
the
best
terms
then
attainable
and
with
the
express
consent
of
the
people
of
those
islands
this
treaty
still
remains
under
consideration
in
the
senate
a
new
convention
has
been
entered
into
with
denmark
enlarging
the
time
fixed
for
final
ratification
of
the
original
treaty
comprehensive
national
policy
would
seem
to
sanction
the
acquisition
and
incorporation
into
our
federal
union
of
the
several
adjacent
continental
and
insular
communities
as
speedily
as
it
can
be
done
peacefully
lawfully
and
without
any
violation
of
national
justice
faith
or
honor
foreign
possession
or
control
of
those
communities
has
hitherto
hindered
the
growth
and
impaired
the
influence
of
the
united
states
chronic
revolution
and
anarchy
there
would
be
equally
injurious
each
one
of
them
when
firmly
established
as
an
independent
republic
or
when
incorporated
into
the
united
states
would
be
a
new
source
of
strength
and
power
conforming
my
administration
to
these
principles
i
have
or
no
occasion
lent
support
or
toleration
to
unlawful
expeditions
set
on
foot
upon
the
plea
of
republican
propagandism
or
of
national
extension
or
aggrandizement
the
necessity
however
of
repressing
such
unlawful
movements
clearly
indicates
the
duty
which
rests
upon
us
of
adapting
our
legislative
action
to
the
new
circumstances
of
a
decline
of
european
monarchical
power
and
influence
and
the
increase
of
american
republican
ideas
interests
and
sympathies
it
can
not
be
long
before
it
will
become
necessary
for
this
government
to
lend
some
effective
aid
to
the
solution
of
the
political
and
social
problems
which
are
continually
kept
before
the
world
by
the
two
republics
of
the
island
of
st
domingo
and
which
are
now
disclosing
themselves
more
distinctly
than
heretofore
in
the
island
of
cuba
the
subject
is
commended
to
your
consideration
with

all
the
more
earnestness
because
i
am
satisfied
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
even
so
direct
a
proceeding
as
a
proposition
for
an
annexation
of
the
two
republics
of
the
island
of
st
domingo
would
not
only
receive
the
consent
of
the
people
interested
but
would
also
give
satisfaction
to
all
other
foreign
nations
i
am
aware
that
upon
the
question
of
further
extending
our
possessions
it
is
apprehended
by
some
that
our
political
system
can
not
successfully
be
applied
to
an
area
more
extended
than
our
continent
but
the
conviction
is
rapidly
gaining
ground
in
the
american
mind
that
with
the
increased
facilities
for
intercommunication
between
all
portions
of
the
earth
the
principles
of
free
government
as
embraced
in
our
constitution
if
faithfully
maintained
and
carried
out
would
prove
of
sufficient
strength
and
breadth
to
comprehend
within
their
sphere
and
influence
the
civilized
nations
of
the
world
the
attention
of
the
senate
and
of
congress
is
again
respectfully
invited
to
the
treaty
for
the
establishment
of
commercial
reciprocity
with
the
hawaiian
kingdom
entered
into
last
year
and
already
ratified
by
that
government
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
toward
these
islands
is
not
very
different
from
that
in
which
they
stand
toward
the
west
indies
it
is
known
and
felt
by
the
hawaiian
government
and
people
that
their
government
and
institutions
are
feeble
and
precarious
that
the
united
states
being
so
near
a
neighbor
would
be
unwilling
to
see
the
islands
pass
under
foreign
control
their
prosperity
is
continually
disturbed
by
expectations
and
alarms
of
unfriendly
political
proceedings
as
well
from
the
united
states
as
from
other
foreign
powers
a
reciprocity
treaty
while
it
could
not
materially
diminish
the
revenues
of
the
united
states
would
be
a
guaranty
of
the
good
will
and
forbearance
of
all
nations
until
the
people
of
the
islands
shall
of
themselves
at
no
distant
day
voluntarily
apply
for
admission
into
the
union
the
emperor
of
russia
has
acceded
to
the
treaty
negotiated
here
in
january
last
for
the
security
of
trademarks
in
the
interest
of
manufacturers
and
commerce
i
have
invited
his
attention
to
the
importance
of
establishing
now
while
it
seems
easy
and
practicable
a
fair
and
equal
regulation
of
the
vast
fisheries
belonging
to
the
two
nations
in
the
waters
of
the
north
pacific
ocean
the
two
treaties
between
the
united
states
and
italy
for
the
regulation
of
consular
powers
and
the
extradition
of
criminals
negotiated
and
ratified
here
during
the
last
session
of
congress
have
been
accepted
and
confirmed
by
the
italian
government
a
liberal
consular
convention
which
has
been
negotiated
with
belgium
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
the
very
important
treaties
which
were
negotiated
between
the
united
states
and
north
germany
and
bavaria
for
the
regulation
of
the
rights
of
naturalized
citizens
have
been
duly
ratified
and
exchanged
and
similar
treaties
have
been
entered
into
with
the
kingdoms
of
belgium
and
wurtemberg
and
with
the
grand
duchies
of
baden
and
hessedarmstadt
i
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
submit
equally
satisfactory
conventions
of
the
same
character
now
in
the
course
of
negotiation
with
the
respective
governments
of
spain
italy
and
the
ottoman
empire
examination
of

agricultural
company
on
account
of

possessory
rights
in

alleged
by
those
companies
in
virtue
of
provisions
of
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
of
june
has
been
diligently
prosecuted
under
the
direction
of
the
joint
international
commission
to
which
they
were
submitted
for
adjudication
by
treaty
between
the
two
governments
of
july
and
will
it
is
expected
be
concluded
at
an
early
day
no
practical
regulation
concerning
colonial
trade
and
the
fisheries
can
be
accomplished
by
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
until
congress
shall
have
expressed
their
judgment
concerning
the
principles
involved
three
other
questions
however
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
remain
open
for
adjustment
these
are
the
mutual
rights
of
naturalized
citizens
the
boundary
question
involving
the
title
to
the
island
of
san
juan
on
the
pacific
coast
and
mutual
claims
arising
since
the
year
of
the
citizens
and
subjects
of
the
two
countries
for
injuries
and
depredations
committed
under
the
authority
of
their
respective
governments
negotiations
upon
these
subjects
are
pending
and
i
am
not
without
hope
of
being
able
to
lay
before
the
senate
for
its
consideration
during
the
present
session
protocols
calculated
to
bring
to
an
end
these
justly
exciting
and
longexisting
controversies
we
are
not
advised
of
the
action
of
the
chinese
government
upon
the
liberal
and
auspicious
treaty
which
was
recently
celebrated
with
its
plenipotentiaries
at
this
capital
japan
remains
a
theater
of
civil
war
marked
by
religious
incidents
and
political
severities
peculiar
to
that
longisolated
empire
the
executive
has
hitherto
maintained
strict
neutrality
among
the
belligerents
and
acknowledges
with
pleasure
that
it
has
been
frankly
and
fully
sustained
in
that
course
by
the
enlightened
concurrence
and
cooperation
of
the
other
treaty
powers
namely
great
britain
france
the
netherlands
north
germany
and
italy
spain
having
recently
undergone
a
revolution
marked
by
extraordinary
unanimity
and
preservation
of
order
the
provisional
government
established
at
madrid
has
been
recognized
and
the
friendly
intercourse
which
has
so
long
happily
existed
between
the
two
countries
remains
unchanged
i
renew
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
communication
to
congress
dated
the
th
july
lasta
copy
of
which
accompanies
this
message
that
the
judgment
of
the
people
should
be
taken
on
the
propriety
of
so
amending
the
federal
constitution
that
it
shall
provide
first
for
an
election
of
president
and
vicepresident
by
a
direct
vote
of
the
people
instead
of
through
the
agency
of
electors
and
making
them
ineligible
for
reelection
to
a
second
term
second
for
a
distinct
designation
of
the
person
who
shall
discharge
the
duties
of
president
in
the
event
of
a
vacancy
in
that
office
by
the
death
resignation
or
removal
of
both
the
president
and
vicepresident
third
for
the
election
of
senators
of
the
united
states
directly
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
instead
of
by
the
legislatures
and
fourth
for
the
limitation
to
a
period
of
years
of
the
terms
of
federal
judges
profoundly
impressed
with
the
propriety
of
making
these
important
modifications
in
the
constitution
i
respectfully
submit
them
for
the
early
and
mature
consideration
of
congress
we
should
as
far
as
possible
remove
all
pretext
for
violations
of
the
organic
law
by
remedying
such
imperfections
as
time
and
experience
may
develop
ever
remembering
that
the
constitution
which
at
any
time
exists
until
changed
by
an
explicit
and
authentic
act
of
the
whole
people
is
sacredly
obligatory
upon
all
in
the
performance
of
a
duty
imposed
upon
me
by
the
constitution
i
have
thus
communicated
to
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommended
for
their
consideration
such
measures
as
have
seemed
to
me
necessary
and
expedient
if
carried
into
effect
they
will
hasten
the
accomplishment
of
the
great
and
beneficent
purposes
for
which
the
constitution
was
ordained
and
which
it
comprehensively
states
were
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
in
congress
are
vested
all
legislative
powers
and
upon
them
devolves
the
responsibility
as
well
for
framing
unwise
and
excessive
laws
as
for
neglecting
to
devise
and
adopt
measures
absolutely
demanded
by
the
wants
of
the
country
let
us
earnestly
hope
that
before
the
expiration
of
our
respective
terms
of
service
now
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
an
allwise
providence
will
so
guide
our
counsels
as
to
strengthen
and
preserve
the
federal
unions
inspire
reverence
for
the
constitution
restore
prosperity
and
happiness
to
our
whole
people
and
promote
on
earth
peace
good
will
toward
men

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
continued
disorganization
of
the
union
to
which
the
president
has
so
often
called
the
attention
of
congress
is
yet
a
subject
of
profound
and
patriotic
concern
we
may
however
find
some
relief
from
that
anxiety
in
the
reflection
that
the
painful
political
situation
although
before
untried
by
ourselves
is
not
new
in
the
experience
of
nations
political
science
perhaps
as
highly
perfected
in
our
own
time
and
country
as
in
any
other
has
not
yet
disclosed
any
means
by
which
civil
wars
can
be
absolutely
prevented
an
enlightened
nation
however
with
a
wise
and
beneficent
constitution
of
free
government
may
diminish
their
frequency
and
mitigate
their
severity
by
directing
all
its
proceedings
in
accordance
with
its
fundamental
law
when
a
civil
war
has
been
brought
to
a
close
it
is
manifestly
the
first
interest
and
duty
of
the
state
to
repair
the
injuries
which
the
war
has
inflicted
and
to
secure
the
benefit
of
the
lessons
it
teaches
as
fully
and
as
speedily
as
possible
this
duty
was
upon
the
termination
of
the
rebellion
promptly
accepted
not
only
by
the
executive
department
but
by
the
insurrectionary
states
themselves
and
restoration
in
the
first
moment
of
peace
was
believed
to
be
as
easy
and
certain
as
it
was
indispensable
the
expectations
however
then
so
reasonably
and
confidently
entertained
were
disappointed
by
legislation
from
which
i
felt
constrained
by
my
obligations
to
the
constitution
to
withhold
my
assent
it
is
therefore
a
source
of
profound
regret
that
in
complying
with
the
obligation
imposed
upon
the
president
by
the
constitution
to
give
to
congress
from
time
to
time
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
i
am
unable
to
communicate
any
definitive
adjustment
satisfactory
to
the
american
people
of
the
questions
which
since
the
close
of
the
rebellion
have
agitated
the
public
mind
on
the
contrary
candor
compels
me
to
declare
that
at
this
time
there
is
no
union
as
our
fathers
understood
the
term
and
as
they
meant
it
to
be
understood
by
us
the
union
which
they
established
can
exist
only
where
all
the
states
are
represented
in
both
houses
of
congress
where
one
state
is
as
free
as
another
to
regulate
its
internal
concerns
according
to
its
own
will
and
where
the
laws
of
the
central
government
strictly
confined
to
matters
of
national
jurisdiction
apply
with
equal
force
to
all
the
people
of
every
section
that
such
is
not
the
present
state
of
the
union
is
a
melancholy
fact
and
we
must
all
acknowledge
that
the
restoration
of
the
states
to
their
proper
legal
relations
with
the
federal
government
and
with
one
another
according
to
the
terms
of
the
original
compact
would
be
the
greatest
temporal
blessing
which
god
in
his
kindest
providence
could
bestow
upon
this
nation
it
becomes
our
imperative
duty
to
consider
whether
or
not
it
is
impossible
to
effect
this
most
desirable
consummation
the
union
and
the
constitution
are
inseparable
as
long
as
one
is
obeyed
by
all
parties
the
other
will
be
preserved
and
if
one
is
destroyed
both
must
perish
together
the
destruction
of
the
constitution
will
be
followed
by
other
and
still
greater
calamities
it
was
ordained
not
only
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
between
the
states
but
to
establish
justice
insure
domestic
tranquillity
provide
for
the
common
defense
promote
the
general
welfare
and
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity
nothing
but
implicit
obedience
to
its
requirements
in
all
parts
of
the
country
will
accomplish
these
great
ends
without
that
obedience
we
can
look
forward
only
to
continual
outrages
upon
individual
rights
incessant
breaches
of
the
public
peace
national
weakness
financial
dishonor
the
total
loss
of
our
prosperity
the
general
corruption
of
morals
and
the
final
extinction
of
popular
freedom
to
save
our
country
from
evils
so
appalling
as
these
we
should
renew
our
efforts
again
and
again
to
me
the
process
of
restoration
seems
perfectly
plain
and
simple
it
consists
merely
in
a
faithful
application
of
the
constitution
and
laws
the
execution
of
the
laws
is
not
now
obstructed
or
opposed
by
physical
force
there
is
no
military
or
other
necessity
real
or
pretended
which
can
prevent
obedience
to
the
constitution
either
north
or
south
all
the
rights
and
all
the
obligations
of
states
and
individuals
can
be
protected
and
enforced
by
means
perfectly
consistent
with
the
fundamental
law
the
courts
may
be
everywhere
open
and
if
open
their
process
would
be
unimpeded
crimes
against
the
united
states
can
be
prevented
or
punished
by
the
proper
judicial
authorities
in
a
manner
entirely
practicable
and
legal
there
is
therefore
no
reason
why
the
constitution
should
not
be
obeyed
unless
those
who
exercise
its
powers
have
determined
that
it
shall
be
disregarded
and
violated
the
mere
naked
will
of
this
government
or
of
some
one
or
more
of
its
branches
is
the
only
obstacle
that
can
exist
to
a
perfect
union
of
all
the
states
on
this
momentous
question
and
some
of
the
measures
growing
out
of
it
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
differ
from
congress
and
have
expressed
my
convictions
without
reserve
though
with
becoming
deference
to
the
opinion
of
the
legislative
department
those
convictions
are
not
only
unchanged
but
strengthened
by
subsequent
events
and
further
reflection
the
transcendent
importance
of
the
subject
will
be
a
sufficient
excuse
for
calling
your
attention
to
some
of
the
reasons
which
have
so
strongly
influenced
my
own
judgment
the
hope
that
we
may
all
finally
concur
in
a
mode
of
settlement
consistent
at
once
with
our
true
interests
and
with
our
sworn
duties
to
the
constitution
is
too
natural
and
too
just
to
be
easily
relinquished
it
is
clear
to
my
apprehension
that
the
states
lately
in
rebellion
are
still
members
of
the
national
union
when
did
they
cease
to
be
so
the
ordinances
of
secession
adopted
by
a
portion
in
most
of
them
a
very
small
portion
of
their
citizens
were
mere
nullities
if
we
admit
now
that
they
were
valid
and
effectual
for
the
purpose
intended
by
their
authors
we
sweep
from
under
our
feet
the
whole
ground
upon
which
we
justified
the
war
were
those
states
afterwards
expelled
from
the
union
by
the
war
the
direct
contrary
was
averred
by
this
government
to
be
its
purpose
and
was
so
understood
by
all
those
who
gave
their
blood
and
treasure
to
aid
in
its
prosecution
it
can
not
be
that
a
successful
war
waged
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
had
the
legal
effect
of
dissolving
it
the
victory
of
the
nations
arms
was
not
the
disgrace
of
her
policy
the
defeat
of
secession
on
the
battlefield
was
not
the
triumph
of
its
lawless
principle
nor
could
congress
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
executive
do
anything
which
would
have
the
effect
directly
or
indirectly
of
separating
the
states
from
each
other
to
dissolve
the
union
is
to
repeal
the
constitution
which
holds
it
together
and
that
is
a
power
which
does
not
belong
to
any
department
of
this
government
or
to
all
of
them
united
this
is
so
plain
that
it
has
been
acknowledged
by
all
branches
of
the
federal
government
the
executive
my
predecessor
as
well
as
myself
and
the
heads
of
all
the
departments
have
uniformly
acted
upon
the
principle
that
the
union
is
not
only
undissolved
but
indissoluble
congress
submitted
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
to
be
ratified
by
the
southern
states
and
accepted
their
acts
of
ratification
as
a
necessary
and
lawful
exercise
of
their
highest
function
if
they
were
not
states
or
were
states
out
of
the
union
their
consent
to
a
change
in
the
fundamental
law
of
the
union
would
have
been
nugatory
and
congress
in
asking
it
committed
a
political
absurdity
the
judiciary
has
also
given
the
solemn
sanction
of
its
authority
to
the
same
view
of
the
case
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
have
included
the
southern
states
in
their
circuits
and
they
are
constantly
in
banc
and
elsewhere
exercising
jurisdiction
which
does
not
belong
to
them
unless
those
states
are
states
of
the
union
if
the
southern
states
are
component
parts
of
the
union
the
constitution
is
the
supreme
law
for
them
as
it
is
for
all
the
other
states
they
are
bound
to
obey
it
and
so
are
we
the
right
of
the
federal
government
which
is
clear
and
unquestionable
to
enforce
the
constitution
upon
them
implies
the
correlative
obligation
on
our
part
to
observe
its
limitations
and
execute
its
guaranties
without
the
constitution
we
are
nothing
by
through
and
under
the
constitution
we
are
what
it
makes
us
we
may
doubt
the
wisdom
of
the
law
we
may
not
approve
of
its
provisions
but
we
can
not
violate
it
merely
because
it
seems
to
confine
our
powers
within
limits
narrower
than
we
could
wish
it
is
not
a
question
of
individual
or
class
or
sectional
interest
much
less
of
party
predominance
but
of
dutyof
high
and
sacred
dutywhich
we
are
all
sworn
to
perform
if
we
can
not
support
the
constitution
with
the
cheerful
alacrity
of
those
who
love
and
believe
in
it
we
must
give
to
it
at
least
the
fidelity
of
public
servants
who
act
under
solemn
obligations
and
commands
which
they
dare
not
disregard
the
constitutional
duty
is
not
the
only
one
which
requires
the
states
to
be
restored
there
is
another
consideration
which
though
of
minor
importance
is
yet
of
great
weight
on
the
d
day
of
july
congress
declared
by
an
almost
unanimous
vote
of
both
houses
that
the
war
should
be
conducted
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
union
and
maintaining
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
constitution
and
laws
without
impairing
the
dignity
equality
and
rights
of
the
states
or
of
individuals
and
that
when
this
was
done
the
war
should
cease
i
do
not
say
that
this
declaration
is
personally
binding
on
those
who
joined
in
making
it
any
more
than
individual
members
of
congress
are
personally
bound
to
pay
a
public
debt
created
under
a
law
for
which
they
voted
but
it
was
a
solemn
public
official
pledge
of
the
national
honor
and
i
can
not
imagine
upon
what
grounds
the
repudiation
of
it
is
to
be
justified
if
it
be
said
that
we
are
not
bound
to
keep
faith
with
rebels
let
it
be
remembered
that
this
promise
was
not
made
to
rebels
only
thou
sands
of
true
men
in
the
south
were
drawn
to
our
standard
by
it
and
hundreds
of
thousands
in
the
north
gave
their
lives
in
the
belief
that
it
would
be
carried
out
it
was
made
on
the
day
after
the
first
great
battle
of
the
war
had
been
fought
and
lost
all
patriotic
and
intelligent
men
then
saw
the
necessity
of
giving
such
an
assurance
and
believed
that
without
it
the
war
would
end
in
disaster
to
our
cause
having
given
that
assurance
in
the
extremity
of
our
peril
the
violation
of
it
now
in
the
day
of
our
power
would
be
a
rude
rending
of
that
good
faith
which
holds
the
moral
world
together
our
country
would
cease
to
have
any
claim
upon
the
confidence
of
men
it
would
make
the
war
not
only
a
failure
but
a
fraud
being
sincerely
convinced
that
these
views
are
correct
i
would
be
unfaithful
to
my
duty
if
i
did
not
recommend
the
repeal
of
the
acts
of
congress
which
place
ten
of
the
southern
states
under
the
domination
of
military
masters
if
calm
reflection
shall
satisfy
a
majority
of
your
honorable
bodies
that
the
acts
referred
to
are
not
only
a
violation
of
the
national
faith
but
in
direct
conflict
with
the
constitution
i
dare
not
permit
myself
to
doubt
that
you
will
immediately
strike
them
from
the
statute
book
to
demonstrate
the
unconstitutional
character
of
those
acts
i
need
do
no
more
than
refer
to
their
general
provisions
it
must
be
seen
at
once
that
they
are
not
authorized
to
dictate
what
alterations
shall
be
made
in
the
constitutions
of
the
several
states
to
control
the
elections
of
state
legislators
and
state
officers
members
of
congress
and
electors
of
president
and
vicepresident
by
arbitrarily
declaring
who
shall
vote
and
who
shall
be
excluded
from
that
privilege
to
dissolve
state
legislatures
or
prevent
them
from
assembling
to
dismiss
judges
and
other
civil
functionaries
of
the
state
and
appoint
others
without
regard
to
state
law
to
organize
and
operate
all
the
political
machinery
of
the
states
to
regulate
the
whole
administration
of
their
domestic
and
local
affairs
according
to
the
mere
will
of
strange
and
irresponsible
agents
sent
among
them
for
that
purposethese
are
powers
not
granted
to
the
federal
government
or
to
any
one
of
its
branches
not
being
granted
we
violate
our
trust
by
assuming
them
as
palpably
as
we
would
by
acting
in
the
face
of
a
positive
interdict
for
the
constitution
forbids
us
to
do
whatever
it
does
not
affirmatively
authorize
either
by
express
words
or
by
clear
implication
if
the
authority
we
desire
to
use
does
not
come
to
us
through
the
constitution
we
can
exercise
it
only
by
usurpation
and
usurpation
is
the
most
dangerous
of
political
crimes
by
that
crime
the
enemies
of
free
government
in
all
ages
have
worked
out
their
designs
against
public
liberty
and
private
right
it
leads
directly
and
immediately
to
the
establishment
of
absolute
rule
for
undelegated
power
is
always
unlimited
and
unrestrained
the
acts
of
congress
in
question
are
not
only
objectionable
for
their
assumption
of
ungranted
power
but
many
of
their
provisions
are
in
conflict
with
the
direct
prohibitions
of
the
constitution
the
constitution
commands
that
a
republican
form
of
government
shall
be
guaranteed
to
all
the
states
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
arrested
without
a
judicial
warrant
or
punished
without
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
jury
that
the
privilege
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
be
denied
in
time
of
peace
and
that
no
bill
of
attainder
shall
be
passed
even
against
a
single
individual
yet
the
system
of
measures
established
by
these
acts
of
congress
does
totally
subvert
and
destroy
the
form
as
well
as
the
substance
of
republican
government
in
the
ten
states
to
which
they
apply
it
binds
them
hand
and
foot
in
absolute
slavery
and
subjects
them
to
a
strange
and
hostile
power
more
unlimited
and
more
likely
to
be
abused
than
any
other
now
known
among
civilized
men
it
tramples
down
all
those
rights
in
which
the
essence
of
liberty
consists
and
which
a
free
government
is
always
most
careful
to
protect
it
denies
the
habeas
corpus
and
the
trial
by
jury
personal
freedom
property
and
life
if
assailed
by
the
passion
the
prejudice
or
the
rapacity
of
the
ruler
have
no
security
whatever
it
has
the
effect
of
a
bill
of
attainder
or
bill
of
pains
and
penalties
not
upon
a
few
individuals
but
upon
whole
masses
including
the
millions
who
inhabit
the
subject
states
and
even
their
unborn
children
these
wrongs
being
expressly
forbidden
can
not
be
constitutionally
inflicted
upon
any
portion
of
our
people
no
matter
how
they
may
have
come
within
our
jurisdiction
and
no
matter
whether
they
live
in
states
territories
or
districts
i
have
no
desire
to
save
from
the
proper
and
just
consequences
of
their
great
crime
those
who
engaged
in
rebellion
against
the
government
but
as
a
mode
of
punishment
the
measures
under
consideration
are
the
most
unreasonable
that
could
be
invented
many
of
those
people
are
perfectly
innocent
many
kept
their
fidelity
to
the
union
untainted
to
the
last
many
were
incapable
of
any
legal
offense
a
large
proportion
even
of
the
persons
able
to
bear
arms
were
forced
into
rebellion
against
their
will
and
of
those
who
are
guilty
with
their
own
consent
the
degrees
of
guilt
are
as
various
as
the
shades
of
their
character
and
temper
but
these
acts
of
congress
confound
them
all
together
in
one
common
doom
indiscriminate
vengeance
upon
classes
sects
and
parties
or
upon
whole
communities
for
offenses
committed
by
a
portion
of
them
against
the
governments
to
which
they
owed
obedience
was
common
in
the
barbarous
ages
of
the
world
but
christianity
and
civilization
have
made
such
progress
that
recourse
to
a
punishment
so
cruel
and
unjust
would
meet
with
the
condemnation
of
all
unprejudiced
and
rightminded
men
the
punitive
justice
of
this
age
and
especially
of
this
country
does
not
consist
in
stripping
whole
states
of
their
liberties
and
reducing
all
their
people
without
distinction
to
the
condition
of
slavery
it
deals
separately
with
each
individual
confines
itself
to
the
forms
of
law
and
vindicates
its
own
purity
by
an
impartial
examination
of
every
case
before
a
competent
judicial
tribunal
if
this
does
not
satisfy
all
our
desires
with
regard
to
southern
rebels
let
us
console
ourselves
by
reflecting
that
a
free
constitution
triumphant
in
war
and
unbroken
in
peace
is
worth
far
more
to
us
and
our
children
than
the
gratification
of
any
present
feeling
i
am
aware
it
is
assumed
that
this
system
of
government
for
the
southern
states
is
not
to
be
perpetual
it
is
true
this
military
government
is
to
be
only
provisional
but
it
is
through
this
temporary
evil
that
a
greater
evil
is
to
be
made
perpetual
if
the
guaranties
of
the
constitution
can
be
broken
provisionally
to
serve
a
temporary
purpose
and
in
a
part
only
of
the
country
we
can
destroy
them
everywhere
and
for
all
time
arbitrary
measures
often
change
but
they
generally
change
for
the
worse
it
is
the
curse
of
despotism
that
it
has
no
halting
place
the
intermitted
exercise
of
its
power
brings
no
sense
of
security
to
its
subjects
for
they
can
never
know
what
more
they
will
be
called
to
endure
when
its
red
right
hand
is
armed
to
plague
them
again
nor
is
it
possible
to
conjecture
how
or
where
power
unrestrained
by
law
may
seek
its
next
victims
the
states
that
are
still
free
may
be
enslaved
at
any
moment
for
if
the
constitution
does
not
protect
all
it
protects
none
it
is
manifestly
and
avowedly
the
object
of
these
laws
to
confer
upon
negroes
the
privilege
of
voting
and
to
disfranchise
such
a
number
of
white
citizens
as
will
give
the
former
a
clear
majority
at
all
elections
in
the
southern
states
this
to
the
minds
of
some
persons
is
so
important
that
a
violation
of
the
constitution
is
justified
as
a
means
of
bringing
it
about
the
morality
is
always
false
which
excuses
a
wrong
because
it
proposes
to
accomplish
a
desirable
end
we
are
not
permitted
to
do
evil
that
good
may
come
but
in
this
case
the
end
itself
is
evil
as
well
as
the
means
the
subjugation
of
the
states
to
negro
domination
would
be
worse
than
the
military
despotism
under
which
they
are
now
suffering
it
was
believed
beforehand
that
the
people
would
endure
any
amount
of
military
oppression
for
any
length
of
time
rather
than
degrade
themselves
by
subjection
to
the
negro
race
therefore
they
have
been
left
without
a
choice
negro
suffrage
was
established
by
act
of
congress
and
the
military
officers
were
commanded
to
superintend
the
process
of
clothing
the
negro
race
with
the
political
privileges
torn
from
white
men
the
blacks
in
the
south
are
entitled
to
be
well
and
humanely
governed
and
to
have
the
protection
of
just
laws
for
all
their
rights
of
person
and
property
if
it
were
practicable
at
this
time
to
give
them
a
government
exclusively
their
own
under
which
they
might
manage
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
way
it
would
become
a
grave
question
whether
we
ought
to
do
so
or
whether
common
humanity
would
not
require
us
to
save
them
from
themselves
but
under
the
circumstances
this
is
only
a
speculative
point
it
is
not
proposed
merely
that
they
shall
govern
themselves
but
that
they
shall
rule
the
white
race
make
and
administer
state
laws
elect
presidents
and
members
of
congress
and
shape
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
the
future
destiny
of
the
whole
country
would
such
a
trust
and
power
be
safe
in
such
hands
the
peculiar
qualities
which
should
characterize
any
people
who
are
fit
to
decide
upon
the
management
of
public
affairs
for
a
great
state
have
seldom
been
combined
it
is
the
glory
of
white
men
to
know
that
they
have
had
these
qualities
in
sufficient
measure
to
build
upon
this
continent
a
great
political
fabric
and
to
preserve
its
stability
for
more
than
ninety
years
while
in
every
other
part
of
the
world
all
similar
experiments
have
failed
but
if
anything
can
be
proved
by
known
facts
if
all
reasoning
upon
evidence
is
not
abandoned
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
in
the
progress
of
nations
negroes
have
shown
less
capacity
for
government
than
any
other
race
of
people
no
independent
government
of

any
form
has
ever
been
successful
in
their
hands
on
the
contrary
wherever
they
have
been
left
to
their
own
devices
they
have
shown
a
constant
tendency
to
relapse
into
barbarism
in
the
southern
states
however
congress
has
undertaken
to
confer
upon
them
the
privilege
of
the
ballot
just
released
from
slavery
it
may
be
doubted
whether
as
a
class
they
know
more
than
their
ancestors
how
to
organize
and
regulate
civil
society
indeed
it
is
admitted
that
the
blacks
of
the
south
are
not
only
regardless
of
the
rights
of
property
but
so
utterly
ignorant
of
public
affairs
that
their
voting
can
consist
in
nothing
more
than
carrying
a
ballot
to
the
place
where
they
are
directed
to
deposit
it
i
need
not
remind
you
that
the
exercise
of
the
elective
franchise
is
the
highest
attribute
of
an
american
citizen
and
that
when
guided
by
virtue
intelligence
patriotism
and
a
proper
appreciation
of
our
free
institutions
it
constitutes
the
true
basis
of
a
democratic
form
of
government
in
which
the
sovereign
power
is
lodged
in
the
body
of
the
people
a
trust
artificially
created
not
for
its
own
sake
but
solely
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
general
welfare
its
influence
for
good
must
necessarily
depend
upon
the
elevated
character
and
true
allegiance
of
the
elector
it
ought
therefore
to
be
reposed
in
none
except
those
who
are
fitted
morally
and
mentally
to
administer
it
well
for
if
conferred
upon
persons
who
do
not
justly
estimate
its
value
and
who
are
indifferent
as
to
its
results
it
will
only
serve
as
a
means
of
placing
power
in
the
hands
of
the
unprincipled
and
ambitious
and
must
eventuate
in
the
complete
destruction
of
that
liberty
of
which
it
should
be
the
most
powerful
conservator
i
have
therefore
heretofore
urged
upon
your
attention
the
great
dangerto
be
apprehended
from
an
untimely
extension
of
the
elective
franchise
to
any
new
class
in
our
country
especially
when
the
large
majority
of
that
class
in
wielding
the
power
thus
placed
in
their
hands
can
not
be
expected
correctly
to
comprehend
the
duties
and
responsibilities
which
pertain
to
suffrage
yesterday
as
it
were
persons
were
held
in
a
condition
of
slavery
that
had
existed
for
generations
today
they
are
freemen
and
are
assumed
by
law
to
be
citizens
it
can
not
be
presumed
from
their
previous
condition
of
servitude
that
as
a
class
they
are
as
well
informed
as
to
the
nature
of
our
government
as
the
intelligent
foreigner
who
makes
our
land
the
home
of
his
choice
in
the
case
of
the
latter
neither
a
residence
of
five
years
and
the
knowledge
of
our
institutions
which
it
gives
nor
attachment
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
are
the
only
conditions
upon
which
he
can
be
admitted
to
citizenship
he
must
prove
in
addition
a
good
moral
character
and
thus
give
reasonable
ground
for
the
belief
that
he
will
be
faithful
to
the
obligations
which
he
assumes
as
a
citizen
of
the
republic
where
a
peoplethe
source
of
all
political
powerspeak
by
their
suffrages
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
ballot
box
it
must
be
carefully
guarded
against
the
control
of
those
who
are
corrupt
in
principle
and
enemies
of
free
institutions
for
it
can
only
become
to
our
political
and
social
system
a
safe
conductor
of
healthy
popular
sentiment
when
kept
free
from
demoralizing
influences
controlled
through
fraud
and
usurpation
by
the
designing
anarchy
and
despotism
must
inevitably
follow
in
the
hands
of
the
patriotic
and
worthy
our
government
will
be
preserved
upon
the
principles
of
the
constitution
inherited
from
our
fathers
it
follows
therefore
that
in
admitting
to
the
ballot
box
a
new
class
of
voters
not
qualified
for
the
exercise
of
the
elective
franchise
we
weaken
our
system
of
government
instead
of
adding
to
its
strength
and
durability
i
yield
to
no
one
in
attachment
to
that
rule
of
general
suffrage
which
distinguishes
our
policy
as
a
nation
but
there
is
a
limit
wisely
observed
hitherto
which
makes
the
ballot
a
privilege
and
a
trust
and
which
requires
of
some
classes
a
time
suitable
for
probation
and
preparation
to
give
it
indiscriminately
to
a
new
class
wholly
unprepared
by
previous
habits
and
opportunities
to
perform
the
trust
which
it
demands
is
to
degrade
it
and
finally
to
destroy
its
power
for
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
no
political
truth
is
better
established
than
that
such
indiscriminate
and
allembracing
extension
of
popular
suffrage
must
end
at
last
in
its
destruction
i
repeat
the
expression
of
my
willingness
to
join
in
any
plan
within
the
scope
of
our
constitutional
authority
which
promises
to
better
the
condition
of
the
negroes
in
the
south
by
encouraging
them
in
industry
enlightening
their
minds
improving
their
morals
and
giving
protection
to
all
their
just
rights
as
freedmen
but
the
transfer
of
our
political
inheritance
to
them
would
in
my
opinion
be
an
abandonment
of
a
duty
which
we
owe
alike
to
the
memory
of
our
fathers
and
the
rights
of
our
children
the
plan
of
putting
the
southern
states
wholly
and
the
general
government
partially
into
the
hands
of
negroes
is
proposed
at
a
time
peculiarly
unpropitious
the
foundations
of
society
have
been
broken
up
by
civil
war
industry
must
be
reorganized
justice
reestablished
public
credit
maintained
and
order
brought
out
of
confusion
to
accomplish
these
ends
would
require
all
the
wisdom
and
virtue
of
the
great
men
who
formed
our
institutions
originally
i
confidently
believe
that
their
descendants
will
be
equal
to
the
arduous
task
before
them
but
it
is
worse
than
madness
to
expect
that
negroes
will
perform
it
for
us
certainly
we
ought
not
to
ask
their
assistance
till
we
despair
of
our
own
competency
the
great
difference
between
the
two
races
in
physical
mental
and
moral
characteristics
will
prevent
an
amalgamation
or
fusion
of
them
together
in
one
homogeneous
mass
if
the
inferior
obtains
the
ascendency
over
the
other
it
will
govern
with
reference
only
to
its
own
interests
for
it
will
recognize
no
common
interestand
create
such
a
tyranny
as
this
continent
has
never
yet
witnessed
already
the
negroes
are
influenced
by
promises
of
confiscation
and
plunder
they
are
taught
to
regard
as
an
enemy
every
white
man
who
has
any
respect
for
the
rights
of
his
own
race
if
this
continues
it
must
become
worse
and
worse
until
all
order
will
be
subverted
all
industry
cease
and
the
fertile
fields
of
the
south
grow
up
into
a
wilderness
of
all
the
dangers
which
our
nation
has
yet
encountered
none
are
equal
to
those
which
must
result
from
the
success
of
the
effort
now
making
to
africanize
the
half
of
our
country
i
would
not
put
considerations
of
money
in
competition
with
justice
and
right
but
the
expenses
incident
to
reconstruction
under
the
system
adopted
by
congress
aggravate
what
i
regard
as
the
intrinsic
wrong
of
the
measure
itself
it
has
cost
uncounted
millions
already
and
if
persisted
in
will
add
largely
to
the
weight
of
taxation
already
too
oppressive
to
be
borne
without
just
complaint
and
may
finally
reduce
the
treasury
of
the
nation
to
a
condition
of
bankruptcy
we
must
not
delude
ourselves
it
will
require
a
strong
standing
army
and
probably
more
than
per
annum
to
maintain
the
supremacy
of
negro
governments
after
they
are
established
the
sum
thus
thrown
away
would
if
properly
used
form
a
sinking
fund
large
enough
to
pay
the
whole
national
debt
in
less
than
fifteen
years
it
is
vain
to
hope
that
negroes
will
maintain
their
ascendency
themselves
without
military
power
they
are
wholly
incapable
of
holding
in
subjection
the
white
people
of
the
south
i
submit
to
the
judgment
of
congress
whether
the
public
credit
may
not
be
injuriously
affected
by
a
system
of
measures
like
this
with
our
debt
and
the
vast
private
interests
which
are
complicated
with
it
we
can
not
be
too
cautious
of
a
policy
which
might
by
possibility
impair
the
confidence
of
the
world
in
our
government
that
confidence
can
only
be
retained
by
carefully
inculcating
the
principles
of
justice
and
honor
on
the
popular
mind
and
by
the
most
scrupulous
fidelity
to
all
our
engagements
of
every
sort
any
serious
breach
of
the
organic
law
persisted
in
for
a
considerable
time
can
not
but
create
fears
for
the
stability
of
our
institutions
habitual
violation
of
prescribed
rules
which
we
bind
ourselves
to
observe
must
demoralize
the
people
our
only
standard
of
civil
duty
being
set
at
naught
the
sheet
anchor
of
our
political
morality
is
lost
the
public
conscience
swings
from
its
moorings
and
yields
to
every
impulse
of
passion
and
interest
if
we
repudiate
the
constitution
we
will
not
be
expected
to
care
much
for
mere
pecuniary
obligations
the
violation
of
such
a
pledge
as
we
made
on
the
d
day
of
july
will
assuredly
diminish
the
market
value
of
our
other
promises
besides
if
we
acknowledge
that
the
national
debt
was
created
not
to
hold
the
states
in
the
union
as
the
taxpayers
were
led
to
suppose
but
to
expel
them
from
it
and
hand
them
over
to
be
governed
by
negroes
the
moral
duty
to
pay
it
may
seem
much
less
clear
i
say
it
may
seem
so
for
i
do
not
admit
that
this
or
any
other
argument
in
favor
of
repudiation
can
be
entertained
as
sound
but
its
influence
on
some
classes
of
minds
may
well
be
apprehended
the
financial
honor
of
a
great
commercial
nation
largely
indebted
and
with
a
republican
form
of
government
administered
by
agents
of
the
popular
choice
is
a
thing
of
such
delicate
texture
and
the
destruction
of
it
would
be
followed
by
such
unspeakable
calamity
that
every
true
patriot
must
desire
to
avoid
whatever
might
expose
it
to
the
slightest
danger
the
great
interests
of
the
country
require
immediate
relief
from
these
enactments
business
in
the
south
is
paralyzed
by
a
sense
of
general
insecurity
by
the
terror
of
confiscation
and
the
dread
of
negro
supremacy
the
southern
trade
from
which
the
north
would
have
derived
so
great
a
profit
under
a
government
of
law
still
languishes
and
can
never
be
revived
until
it
ceases
to
be
fettered
by
the
arbitrary
power
which
makes
all
its
operations
unsafe
that
rich
countrythe
richest
in
natural
resources
the
world
ever
sawis
worse
than
lost
if
it
be
not
soon
placed
under
the
protection
of
a
free
const
itution
instead
of
being
as
it
ought
to
be
a
source
of
wealth
and
power
it
will
become
an
intolerable
burden
upon
the
rest
of
the
nation
another
reason
for
retracing
our
steps
will
doubtless
be
seen
by
congress
in
the
late
manifestations
of
public
opinion
upon
this
subject
we
live
in
a
country
where
the
popular
will
always
enforces
obedience
to
itself
sooner
or
later
it
is
vain
to
think
of
opposing
it
with
anything
short
of
legal
authority
backed
by
overwhelming
force
it
can
not
have
escaped
your
attention
that
from
the
day
on
which
congress
fairly
and
formally
presented
the
proposition
to
govern
the
southern
states
by
military
force
with
a
view
to
the
ultimate
establishment
of
negro
supremacy
every
expression
of
the
general
sentiment
has
been
more
or
less
adverse
to
it
the
affections
of
this
generation
can
not
be
detached
from
the
institutions
of
their
ancestors
their
determination
to
preserve
the
inheritance
of
free
government
in
their
own
hands
and
transmit
it
undivided
and
unimpaired
to
their
own
posterity
is
too
strong
to
be
successfully
opposed
every
weaker
passion
will
disappear
before
that
love
of
liberty
and
law
for
which
the
american
people
are
distinguished
above
all
others
in
the
world
how
far
the
duty
of
the
president
to
preserve
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
requires
him
to
go
in
opposing
an
unconstitutional
act
of
congress
is
a
very
serious
and
important
question
on
which
i
have
deliberated
much
and
felt
extremely
anxious
to
reach
a
proper
conclusion
where
an
act
has
been
passed
according
to
the
forms
of
the
constitution
by
the
supreme
legislative
authority
and
is
regularly
enrolled
among
the
public
statutes
of
the
country
executive
resistance
to
it
especially
in
times
of
high
party
excitement
would
be
likely
to
produce
violent
collision
between
the
respective
adherents
of
the
two
branches
of
the
government
this
would
be
simply
civil
war
and
civil
war
must
be
resorted
to
only
as
the
last
remedy
for
the
worst
of
evils
whatever
might
tend
to
provoke
it
should
be
most
carefully
avoided
a
faithful
and
conscientious
magistrate
will
concede
very
much
to
honest
error
and
something
even
to
perverse
malice
before
he
will
endanger
the
public
peace
and
he
will
not
adopt
forcible
measures
or
such
as
might
lead
to
force
as
long
as
those
which
are
peaceable
remain
open
to
him
or
to
his
constituents
it
is
true
that
cases
may
occur
in
which
the
executive
would
be
compelled
to
stand
on
its
rights
and
maintain
them
regardless
of
all
consequences
if
congress
should
pass
an
act
which
is
not
only
in
palpable
conflict
with
the
constitution
but
will
certainly
if
carried
out
produce
immediate
and
irreparable
injury
to
the
organic
structure
of
the
government
and
if
there
be
neither
judicial
remedy
for
the
wrongs
it
inflicts
nor
power
in
the
people
to
protect
themselves
without
the
official
aid
of
their
elected
defenderif
for
instance
the
legislative
department
should
pass
an
act
even
through
all
the
forms
of
law
to
abolish
a
coordinate
department
of
the
governmentin
such
a
case
the
president
must
take
the
high
responsibilities
of
his
office
and
save
the
life
of
the
nation
at
all
hazards
the
socalled
reconstruction
acts
though
as
plainly
unconstitutional
as
any
that
can
be
imagined
were
not
believed
to
be
within
the
class
last
mentioned
the
people
were
not
wholly
disarmed
of
the
power
of
selfdefense
in
all
the
northern
states
they
still
held
in
their
hands
the
sacred
right
of
the
ballot
and
it
was
safe
to
believe
that
in
due
time
they
would
come
to
the
rescue
of
their
own
institutions
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
add
that
the
appeal
to
our
common
constituents
was
not
taken
in
vain
and
that
my
confidence
in
their
wisdom
and
virtue
seems
not
to
have
been
misplaced
it
is
well
and
publicly
known
that
enormous
frauds
have
been
perpetrated
on
the
treasury
and
that
colossal
fortunes
have
been
made
at
the
public
expense
this
species
of
corruption
has
increased
is
increasing
and
if
not
diminished
will
soon
bring
us
into
total
ruin
and
disgrace
the
public
creditors
and
the
taxpayers
are
alike
interested
in
an
honest
administration
of
the
finances
and
neither
class
will
long
endure
the
largehanded
robberies
of
the
recent
past
for
this
discreditable
state
of
things
there
are
several
causes
some
of
the
taxes
are
so
laid
as
to
present
an
irresistible
temptation
to
evade
payment
the
great
sums
which
officers
may
win
by
connivance
at
fraud
create
a
pressure
which
is
more
than
the
virtue
of
many
can
withstand
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
open
disregard
of
constitutional
obligations
avowed
by
some
of
the
highest
and
most
influential
men
in
the
country
has
greatly
weakened
the
moral
sense
of
those
who
serve
in
subordinate
places
the
expenses
of
the
united
states
including
interest
on
the
public
debt
are
more
than
six
times
as
much
as
they
were
seven
years
ago
to
collect
and
disburse
this
vast
amount
requires
careful
supervision
as
well
as
systematic
vigilance
the
system
never
perfected
was
much
disorganized
by
the
tenureofoffice
bill
which
has
almost
destroyed
official
accountability
the
president
may
be
thoroughly
convinced
that
an
officer
is
incapable
dishonest
or
unfaithful
to
the
constitution
but
under
the
law
which
i
have
named
the
utmost
he
can
do
is
to
complain
to
the
senate
and
ask
the
privilege
of
supplying
his
place
with
a
better
man
if
the
senate
be
regarded
as
personally
or
politically
hostile
to
the
president
it
is
natural
and
not
altogether
unreasonable
for
the
officer
to
expect
that
it
will
take
his
part
as
far
as
possible
restore
him
to
his
place
and
give
him
a
triumph
over
his
executive
superior
the
officer
has
other
chances
of
impunity
arising
from
accidental
defects
of
evidence
the
mode
of
investigating
it
and
the
secrecy
of
the
hearing
it
is
not
wonderful
that
official
malfeasance
should
become
bold
in
proportion
as
the
delinquents
learn
to
think
themselves
safe
i
am
entirely
persuaded
that
under
such
a
rule
the
president
can
not
perform
the
great
duty
assigned
to
him
of
seeing
the
laws
faithfully
executed
and
that
it
disables
him
most
especially
from
enforcing
that
rigid
accountability
which
is
necessary
to
the
due
execution
of
the
revenue
laws
the
constitution
invests
the
president
with
authority
to
decide
whether
a
removal
should
be
made
in
any
given
case
the
act
of
congress
declares
in
substance
that
he
shall
only
accuse
such
as
he
supposes
to
be
unworthy
of
their
trust
the
constitution
makes
him
sole
judge
in
the
premises
but
the
statute
takes
away
his
jurisdiction
transfers
it
to
the
senate
and
leaves
him
nothing
but
the
odious
and
sometimes
impracticable
duty
of
becoming
a
prosecutor
the
prosecution
is
to
be
conducted
before
a
tribunal
whose
members
are
not
like
him
responsible
to
the
whole
people
but
to
separate
constituent
bodies
and
who
may
hear
his
accusation
with
great
disfavor
the
senate
is
absolutely
without
any
known
standard
of
decision
applicable
to
such
a
case
its
judgment
can
not
be
anticipated
for
it
is
not
governed
by
any
rule
the
law
does
not
define
what
shall
be
deemed
good
cause
for
removal
it
is
impossible
even
to
conjecture
what
may
or
may
not
be
so
considered
by
the
senate
the
nature
of
the
subject
forbids
clear
proof
if
the
charge
be
incapacity
what
evidence
will
support
it
fidelity
to
the
constitution
may
be
understood
or
misunderstood
in
a
thousand
different
ways
and
by
violent
party
men
in
violent
party
times
unfaithfulness
to
the
constitution
may
even
come
to
be
considered
meritorious
if
the
officer
be
accused
of
dishonesty
how
shall
it
be
made
out
will
it
be
inferred
from
acts
unconnected
with
public
duty
from
private
history
or
from
general
reputation
or
must
the
president
await
the
commission
of
an
actual
misdemeanor
in
office
shall
he
in
the
meantime
risk
the
character
and
interest
of
the
nation
in
the
hands
of
men
to
whom
he
can
not
give
his
confidence
must
he
forbear
his
complaint
until
the
mischief
is
done
and
can
not
be
prevented
if
his
zeal
in
the
public
service
should
impel
him
to
anticipate
the
overt
act
must
he
move
at
the
peril
of
being
tried
himself
for
the
offense
of
slandering
his
subordinate
in
the
present
circumstances
of
the
country
someone
must
be
held
responsible
for
official
delinquency
of
every
kind
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
say
where
that
responsibility
should
be
thrown
if
it
be
not
left
where
it
has
been
placed
by
the
constitution
but
all
just
men
will
admit
that
the
president
ought
to
be
entirely
relieved
from
such
responsibility
if
he
can
not
meet
it
by
reason
of
restrictions
placed
by
law
upon
his
action
the
unrestricted
power
of
removal
from
office
is
a
very
great
one
to
be
trusted
even
to
a
magistrate
chosen
by
the
general
suffrage
of
the
whole
people
and
accountable
directly
to
them
for
his
acts
it
is
undoubtedly
liable
to
abuse
and
at
some
periods
of
our
history
perhaps
has
been
abused
if
it
be
thought
desirable
and
constitutional
that
it
should
be
so
limited
as
to
make
the
president
merely
a
common
informer
against
other
public
agents
he
should
at
least
be
permitted
to
act
in
that
capacity
before
some
open
tribunal
independent
of
party
politics
ready
to
investigate
the
merits
of
every
case
furnished
with
the
means
of
taking
evidence
and
bound
to
decide
according
to
established
rules
this
would
guarantee
the
safety
of
the
accuser
when
he
acts
in
good
faith
and
at
the
same
time
secure
the
rights
of
the
other
party
i
speak
of
course
with
all
proper
respect
for
the
present
senate
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
any
legislative
body
can
be
so
constituted
as
to
insure
its
fitness
for
these
functions
it
is
not
the
theory
of
this
government
that
public
offices
are
the
property
of
those
who
hold
them
they
are
given
merely
as
a
trust
for
the
public
benefit
sometimes
for
a
fixed
period
sometimes
during
good
behavior
but
generally
they
are
liable
to
be
terminated
at
the
pleasure
of
the
appointing
power
which
represents
the
collective
majesty
and
speaks
the
will
of
the
people
the
forced
retention
in
office
of
a
single
dishonest
person
may
work
great
injury

to
the
public
interests
the
danger
to
the
public
service
comes
not
from
the
power
to
remove
but
from
the
power
to
appoint
therefore
it
was
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
left
the
power
of
removal
unrestricted
while
they
gave
the
senate
a
fight
to
reject
all
appointments
which
in
its
opinion
were
not
fit
to
be
made
a
little
reflection
on
this
subject
will
probably
satisfy
all
who
have
the
good
of
the
country
at
heart
that
our
best
course
is
to
take
the
constitution
for
our
guide
walk
in
the
path
marked
out
by
the
founders
of
the
republic
and
obey
the
rules
made
sacred
by
the
observance
of
our
great
predecessors
the
present
condition
of
our
finances
and
circulating
medium
is
one
to
which
your
early
consideration
is
invited
the
proportion
which
the
currency
of
any
country
should
bear
to
the
whole
value
of
the
annual
produce
circulated
by
its
means
is
a
question
upon
which
political
economists
have
not
agreed
nor
can
it
be
controlled
by
legislation
but
must
be
left
to
the
irrevocable
laws
which
everywhere
regulate
commerce
and
trade
the
circulating
medium
will
ever
irresistibly
flow
to
those
points
where
it
is
in
greatest
demand
the
law
of
demand
and
supply
is
as
unerring
as
that
which
regulates
the
tides
of
the
ocean
and
indeed
currency
like
the
tides
has
its
ebbs
and
flows
throughout
the
commercial
world
at
the
beginning
of
the
rebellion
the
banknote
circulation
of
the
country
amounted
to
not
much
more
than
now
the
circulation
of
nationalbank
notes
and
those
known
as
legaltenders
is
nearly
seven
hundred
millions
while
it
is
urged
by
some
that
this
amount
should
be
increased
others
contend
that
a
decided
reduction
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
best
interests
of
the
country
in
view
of
these
diverse
opinions
it
may
be
well
to
ascertain
the
real
value
of
our
paper
issues
when
compared
with
a
metallic
or
convertible
currency
for
this
purpose
let
us
inquire
how
much
gold
and
silver
could
be
purchased
by
the
seven
hundred
millions
of
paper
money
now
in
circulation
probably
not
more
than
half
the
amount
of
the
latter
showing
that
when
our
paper
currency
is
compared
with
gold
and
silver
its
commercial
value
is
compressed
into
three
hundred
and
fifty
millions
this
striking
fact
makes
it
the
obvious
duty
of
the
government
as
early
as
may
be
consistent
with
the
principles
of
sound
political
economy
to
take
such
measures
as
will
enable
the
holder
of
its
notes
and
those
of
the
national
banks
to
convert
them
without
loss
into
specie
or
its
equivalent
a
reduction
of
our
paper
circulating
medium
need
not
necessarily
follow
this
however
would
depend
upon
the
law
of
demand
and
supply
though
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
by
making
legaltender
and
bank
notes
convertible
into
coin
or
its
equivalent
their
present
specie
value
in
the
hands
of
their
holders
would
be
enhanced
per
cent
legislation
for
the
accomplishment
of
a
result
so
desirable
is
demanded
by
the
highest
public
considerations
the
constitution
contemplates
that
the
circulating
medium
of
the
country
shall
be
uniform
in
quality
and
value
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
that
instrument
the
country
had
just
emerged
from
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
redundant
and
worthless
paper
currency
the
sages
of
that
period
were
anxious
to
protect
their
posterity
from
the
evils
that
they
themselves
had
experienced
hence
in
providing
a
circulating
medium
they
conferred
upon
congress
the
power
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
thereof
at
the
same
time
prohibiting
the
states
from
making
anything
but
gold
and
silver
a
tender
in
payment
of
debts
the
anomalous
condition
of
our
currency
is
in
striking
contrast
with
that
which
was
originally
designed
our
circulation
now
embraces
first
notes
of
the
national
banks
which
are
made
receivable
for
all
dues
to
the
government
excluding
imposts
and
by
all
its
creditors
excepting
in
payment
of
interest
upon
its
bonds
and
the
securities
themselves
second
legaltender
notes
issued
by
the
united
states
and
which
the
law
requires
shall
be
received
as
well
in
payment
of
all
debts
between
citizens
as
of
all
government
dues
excepting
imposts
and
third
gold
and
silver
coin
by
the
operation
of
our
present
system
of
finance
however
the
metallic
currency
when
collected
is
reserved
only
for
one
class
of
government
creditors
who
holding
its
bonds
semiannually
receive
their
interest
in
coin
from
the
national
treasury
they
are
thus
made
to
occupy
an
invidious
position
which
may
be
used
to
strengthen
the
arguments
of
those
who
would
bring
into
disrepute
the
obligations
of
the
nation
in
the
payment
of
all
its
debts
the
plighted
faith
of
the
government
should
be
inviolably
maintained
but
while
it
acts
with
fidelity
toward
the
bondholder
who
loaned
his
money
that
the
integrity
of
the
union
might
be
preserved
it
should
at
the
same
time
observe
good
faith
with
the
great
masses
of
the
people
who
having
rescued
the
union
from
the
perils
of
rebellion
now
bear
the
burdens
of
taxation
that
the
government
may
be
able
to
fulfill
its
engagements
there
is
no
reason
which
will
be
accepted
as
satisfactory
by
the
people
why
those
who
defend
us
on
the
land
and
protect
us
on
the
sea
the
pensioner
upon
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
bearing
the
scars
and
wounds
received
while
in
its
service
the
public
servants
in
the
various
departments
of
the
government
the
farmer
who
supplies
the
soldiers
of
the
army
and
the
sailors
of
the
navy
the
artisan
who
toils
in
the
nations
workshops
or
the
mechanics
and
laborers
who
build
its
edifices
and
construct
its
forts
and
vessels
of
war
should
in
payment
of
their
just
and
hardearned
dues
receive
depreciated
paper
while
another
class
of
their
countrymen
no
more
deserving
are
paid
in
coin
of
gold
and
silver
equal
and
exact
justice
requires
that
all
the
creditors
of
the
government
should
be
paid
in
a
currency
possessing
a
uniform
value
this
can
only
be
accomplished
by
the
restoration
of
the
currency
to
the
standard
established
by
the
constitution
and
by
this
means
we
would
remove
a
discrimination
which
may
if
it
has
not
already
done
so
create
a
prejudice
that
may
become
deep
rooted
and
widespread
and
imperil
the
national
credit
the
feasibility
of
making
our
currency
correspond
with
the
constitutional
standard
may
be
seen
by
reference
to
a
few
facts
derived
from
our
commercial
statistics
the
production
of
precious
metals
in
the
united
states
from
to
inclusive
amounted
to

these
are
important
facts
and
show
how
completely
the
inferior
currency
will
supersede
the
better
forcing
it
from
circulation
among
the
masses
and
causing
it
to
be
exported
as
a
mere
article
of
trade
to
add
to
the
money
capital
of
foreign
lands
they
show
the
necessity
of
retiring
our
paper
money
that
the
return
of
gold
and
silver
to
the
avenues
of
trade
may
be
invited
and
a
demand
created
which
will
cause
the
retention
at

of
at
least
so
much
of
the
productions
of
our
rich
and
inexhaustible
goldbearing
fields
as
may
be
sufficient
for
purposes
of
circulation
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
a
return
to
a
sound
currency
so
long
as
the
government
by
continuing
to
issue
irredeemable
notes
fills
the
channels
of
circulation
with
depreciated
paper
notwithstanding
a
coinage
by
our
mints
since
of
the
people
are
now
strangers
to
the
currency
which
was
designed
for
their
use
and
benefit
and
specimens
of
the
precious
metals
bearing
the
national
device
are
seldom
seen
except
when
produced
to
gratify
the
interest
excited
by
their
novelty
if
depreciated
paper
is
to
be
continued
as
the
permanent
currency
of
the
country
and
all
our
coin
is
to
become
a
mere
article
of
traffic
and
speculation
to
the
enhancement
in
price
of
all
that
is
indispensable
to
the
comfort
of
the
people
it
would
be
wise
economy
to
abolish
our
mints
thus
saving
the
nation
the
care
and
expense
incident
to
such
establishments
and
let
all
our
precious
metals
be
exported
in
bullion
the
time
has
come
however
when
the
government
and
national
banks
should
be
required
to
take
the
most
efficient
steps
and
make
all
necessary
arrangements
for
a
resumption
of
specie
payments
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
specie
payments
having
been
once
resumed
by
the
government
and
banks
all
notes
or
bills
of
paper
issued
by
either
of
a
less
denomination
than
should
by
law
be
excluded
from
circulation
so
that
the
people
may
have
the
benefit
and
convenience
of
a
gold
and
silver
currency
which
in
all
their
business
transactions
will
be
uniform
in
value
at
home
and
abroad
every
man
of
property
or
industry
every
man
who
desires
to
preserve
what
he
honestly
possesses
or
to
obtain
what
he
can
honestly
earn
has
a

a

not
liable
to
vibrate
with

not
subject
to
be
blown
up
or
blown
down
by
the
breath
of
speculation
but
to
be
made
stable
and
secure
a
disordered
currency
is
one
of
the
greatest
political
evils
it
undermines
the
virtues
necessary
for
the
support
of
the

system
and
encourages
propensities
destructive

it
wars
against

for

man

exempt

all
in

abilities
would
contribute
toward

a
modification
of
the
internalrevenue
system
by
a
large
reduction
in

take
from

the

report

furnishes
interesting
information
in
reference
to
the
important
branches
of
the
public

connected
with

the
menacing
attitude
of
some
of

warlike
bands
of
indians
inhabiting
the
district
of

between
the
arkansas
and
platte
rivers

portions
of

territory
required
the
presence
of
a
large
military
force
in
that
region
instigated
by
real
or
imaginary
grievances
the
indians
occasionally
committed
acts
of
barbarous
violence
upon
emigrants
and
our
frontier
settlements
but
a
general
indian
war
has
been
providentially
averted
the
commissioners
under

reservations

entered
without
delay
upon
the
execution
of
their
trust
but
have
not
yet
made
any
official
report
of
their

it
is
of
vital
importance
that
our
distant
territories
should
be
exempt
from
indian
outbreaks
and
that
the
construction
of
the
pacific
railroad
an
object
of
national
importance
should
not
be
interrupted
by
hostile
tribes
these
objects
as
well
as
the
material
interests
and
the
moral
and
intellectual
improvement
of
the
indians
can
be
most
effectually
secured
by
concentrating
them
upon
portions
of

set
apart
for
their
exclusive
use
and
located
at
points
remote
from

foreign
states
not
hitherto
represented
a
report
of
these
interesting
proceedings
will

which
will
no

the

may
be
deemed
worthy
of
your
attention
no

has
yet
been
reached
for
the
settlement
of
our
claims
for
british
depredations
upon
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
i
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
decline
the
proposition
of
arbitration
made
by
her
majestys
government
because
it
has
hitherto
been
accompanied
by
reservations
and
limitations
incompatible
with
the
rights
interest
and
honor
of
our
country
it
is
not
to
be
apprehended
that
great
britain
will
persist
in
her
refusal
to
satisfy
these
just
and
reasonable
claims
which
involve
the
sacred
principle
of
noninterventiona
principle
henceforth
not
more
important
to
the
united
states
than
to
all
other
commercial
nations
the
west
india
islands
were
settled
and
colonized
by
european
states
simultaneously
with
the
settlement
and
colonization
of
the
american
continent
most
of
the
colonies
planted
here
became
independent
nations
in
the
close
of
the
last
and
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
our
own
country
embraces
communities
which
at
one
period
were
colonies
of
great
britain
france
spain
holland
sweden
and
russia
the
people
in
the
west
indies
with
the
exception
of
those
of
the
island
of
hayti
have
neither
attained
nor
aspired
to
independence
nor
have
they
become
prepared
for
selfdefense
although
possessing
considerable
commercial
value
they
have
been
held
by
the
several
european
states
which
colonized
or
at
some
time
conquered
them
chiefly
for
purposes
of
military
and
naval
strategy
in
carrying
out
european
policy
and
designs
in
regard
to
this
continent
in
our
revolutionary
war
ports
and
harbors
in
the
west
india
islands
were
used
by
our
enemy
to
the
great
injury
and
embarrassment
of
the
united
states
we
had
the
same
experience
in
our
second
war
with
great
britain
the
same
european
policy
for
a
long
time
excluded
us
even
from
trade
with
the
west
indies
while
we
were
at
peace
with
all
nations
in
our
recent
civil
war
the
rebels
and
their
piratical
and
blockadebreaking
allies
found
facilities
in
the
same
ports
for
the
work
which
they
too
successfully
accomplished
of
injuring
and
devastating
the
commerce
which
we
are
now
engaged
in
rebuilding
we
labored
especially
under
this
disadvantage
that
european
steam
vessels
employed
by
our
enemies
found
friendly
shelter
protection
and
supplies
in
west
indian
ports
while
our
naval
operations
were
necessarily
carried
on
from
our
own
distant
shores
there
was
then
a
universal
feeling
of
the
want
of
an
advanced
naval
outpost
between
the
atlantic
coast
and
europe
the
duty
of
obtaining
such
an
outpost
peacefully
and
lawfully
while
neither
doing
nor
menacing
injury
to
other
states
earnestly
engaged
the
attention
of
the
executive
department
before
the
close
of
the
war
and
it
has
not
been
lost
sight
of
since
that
time
a
not
entirely
dissimilar
naval
want
revealed
itself
during
the
same
period
on
the
pacific
coast
the
required
foothold
there
was
fortunately
secured
by
our
late
treaty
with
the
emperor
of
russia
and
it
now
seems
imperative
that
the
more
obvious
necessities
of
the
atlantic
coast
should
not
be
less
carefully
provided
for
a
good
and
convenient
port
and
harbor
capable
of
easy
defense
will
supply
that
want
with
the
possession
of
such
a
station
by
the
united
states
neither
we
nor
any
other
american
nation
need
longer
apprehend
injury
or
offense
from
any
transatlantic
enemy
i
agree
with
our
early
statesmen
that
the
west
indies
naturally
gravitate
to
and
may
be
expected
ultimately
to
be
absorbed
by
the
continental
states
including
our
own
i
agree
with
them
also
that
it
is
wise
to
leave
the
question
of
such
absorption
to
this
process
of
natural
political
gravitation
the
islands
of
st
thomas
and
st
john
which
constitute
a
part
of
the
group
called
the
virgin
islands
seemed
to
offer
us
advantages
immediately
desirable
while
their
acquisition
could
be
secured
in
harmony
with
the
principles
to
which
i
have
alluded
a
treaty
has
therefore
been
concluded
with
the
king
of
denmark
for
the
cession
of
those
islands
and
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
consideration
it
will
hardly
be
necessary
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
of
providing
for
the
payment
to
russia
of
the
sum
stipulated
in
the
treaty
for
the
cession
of
alaska
possession
having
been
formally
delivered
to
our
commissioner
the
territory
remains
for
the
present
in
care
of
a
military
force
awaiting
such
civil
organization
as
shall
be
directed
by
congress
the
annexation
of
many
small
german
states
to
prussia
and
the
reorganization
of
that
country
under
a
new
and
liberal
constitution
have
induced
me
to
renew
the
effort
to
obtain
a
just
and
prompt
settlement
of
the
longvexed
question
concerning
the
claims
of
foreign
states
for
military
service
from
their
subjects
naturalized
in
the
united
states
in
connection
with
this
subject
the
attention
of
congress
is
respectfully
called
to
a
singular
and
embarrassing
conflict
of
laws
the
executive
department
of
this
government
has
hitherto
uniformly
held
as
it
now
holds
that
naturalization
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
absolves
the
recipient
from
his
native
allegiance
the
courts
of
great
britain
hold
that
allegiance
to
the
british
crown
is
indefensible
and
is
not
absolved
by
our
laws
of
naturalization
british
judges
cite
courts
and
law
authorities
of
the
united
states
in
support
of
that
theory
against
the
position
held
by
the
executive
authority
of
the
united
states
this
conflict
perplexes
the
public
mind
concerning
the
rights
of
naturalized
citizens
and
impairs
the
national
authority
abroad
i
called
attention
to
this
subject
in
my
last
annual
message
and
now
again
respectfully
appeal
to
congress
to
declare
the
national
will
unmistakably
upon
this
important
question
the
abuse
of
our
laws
by
the
clandestine
prosecution
of
the
african
slave
trade
from
american
ports
or
by
american
citizens
has
altogether
ceased
and
under
existing
circumstances
no
apprehensions
of
its
renewal
in
this
part
of
the
world
are
entertained
under
these
circumstances
it
becomes
a
question
whether
we
shall
not
propose
to
her
majestys
government
a
suspension
or
discontinuance
of
the
stipulations
for
maintaining
a
naval
force
for
the
suppression
of
that
trade

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
after
a
brief
interval
the
congress
of
the
united
states
resumes
its
annual
legislative
labors
an
allwise
and
merciful
providence
has
abated
the
pestilence
which
visited
our
shores
leaving
its
calamitous
traces
upon
some
portions
of
our
country
peace
order
tranquillity
and
civil
authority
have
been
formally
declared
to
exist
throughout
the
whole
of
the
united
states
in
all
of
the
states
civil
authority
has
superseded
the
coercion
of
arms
and
the
people
by
their
voluntary
action
are
maintaining
their
governments
in
full
activity
and
complete
operation
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
is
no
longer
obstructed
in
any
state
by
combinations
too
powerful
to
be
suppressed
by
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings
and
the
animosities
engendered
by
the
war
are
rapidly
yielding
to
the
beneficent
influences
of
our
free
institutions
and
to
the
kindly
effects
of
unrestricted
social
and
commercial
intercourse
an
entire
restoration
of
fraternal
feeling
must
be
the
earnest
wish
of
every
patriotic
heart
and
we
will
have
accomplished
our
grandest
national
achievement
when
forgetting
the
sad
events
of
the
past
and
remembering
only
their
instructive
lessons
we
resume
our
onward
career
as
a
free
prosperous
and
united
people
in
my
message
of
the
th
of
december
congress
was
informed
of
the
measures
which
had
been
instituted
by
the
executive
with
a
view
to
the
gradual
restoration
of
the
states
in
which
the
insurrection
occurred
to
their
relations
with
the
general
government
provisional
governors
had
been
appointed
conventions
called
governors
elected
legislatures
assembled
and
senators
and
representatives
chosen
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
courts
had
been
opened
for
the
enforcement
of
laws
long
in
abeyance
the
blockade
had
been
removed
customhouses
reestablished
and
the
internalrevenue
laws
put
in
force
in
order
that
the
people
might
contribute
to
the
national
income
postal
operations
had
been
renewed
and
efforts
were
being
made
to
restore
them
to
their
former
condition
of
efficiency
the
states
themselves
had
been
asked
to
take
dart
in
the
high
function
of
amending
the
constitution
and
of
thus
sanctioning
the
extinction
of
african
slavery
as
one
of
the
legitimate
results
of
our
internecine
struggle
having
progressed
thus
far
the
executive
department
found
that
it
had
accomplished
nearly
all
that
was
within
the
scope
of
its
constitutional
authority
one
thing
however
yet
remained
to
be
done
before
the
work
of
restoration
could
be
completed
and
that
was
the
admission
to
congress
of
loyal
senators
and
representatives
from
the
states
whose
people
had
rebelled
against
the
lawful
authority
of
the
general
government
this
question
devolved
upon
the
respective
houses
which
by
the
constitution
are
made
the
judges
of
the
elections
returns
and
qualifications
of
their
own
members
and
its
consideration
at
once
engaged
the
attention
of
congress
in
the
meantime
the
executive
departmentno
other
plan
having
been
proposed
by
congresscontinued
its
efforts
to
perfect
as
far
as
was
practicable
the
restoration
of
the
proper
relations
between
the
citizens
of
the
respective
states
the
states
and
the
federal
government
extending
from
time
to
time
as
the
public
interests
seemed
to
require
the
judicial
revenue
and
postal
systems
of
the
country
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
the
necessary
officers
were
appointed
and
appropriations
made
by
congress
for
the
payment
of
their
salaries
the
proposition
to
amend
the
federal
constitution
so
as
to
prevent
the
existence
of
slavery
within
the
united
states
or
any
place
subject
to
their
jurisdiction
was
ratified
by
the
requisite
number
of
states
and
on
the
th
day
of
december
it
was
officially
declared
to
have
become
valid
as
a
part
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
all
of
the
states
in
which
the
insurrection
had
existed
promptly
amended
their
constitutions
so
as
to
make
them
conform
to
the
great
change
thus
effected
in
the
organic
law
of
the
land
declared
null
and
void
all
ordinances
and
laws
of
secession
repudiated
all
pretended
debts
and
obligations
created
for
the
revolutionary
purposes
of
the
insurrection
and
proceeded
in
good
faith
to
the
enactment
of
measures
for
the
protection
and
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
colored
race
congress
however
yet
hesitated
to
admit
any
of
these
states
to
representation
and
it
was
not
until
toward
the
close
of
the
eighth
month
of
the
session
that
an
exception
was
made
in
favor
of
tennessee
by
the
admission
of
her
senators
and
representatives
i
deem
it
a
subject
of
profound
regret
that
congress
has
thus
far
failed
to
admit
to
seats
loyal
senators
and
representatives
from
the
other
states
whose
inhabitants
with
those
of
tennessee
had
engaged
in
the
rebellion
ten
statesmore
than
onefourth
of
the
whole
numberremain
without
representation
the
seats
of
fifty
members
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
twenty
members
in
the
senate
are
yet
vacant
not
by
their
own
consent
not
by
a
failure
of
election
but
by
the
refusal
of
congress
to
accept
their
credentials
their
admission
it
is
believed
would
have
accomplished
much
toward
the
renewal
and
strengthening
of
our
relations
as
one
people
and
removed
serious
cause
for
discontent
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
states
it
would
have
accorded
with
the
great
principle
enunciated
in
the
declaration
of
american
independence
that
no
people
ought
to
bear
the
burden
of
taxation
and
yet
be
denied
the
right
of
representation
it
would
have
been
in
consonance
with
the
express
provisions
of
the
constitution
that
each
state
shall
have
at
least
one
representative
and
that
no
state
without
its
consent
shall
be
deprived
of
its
equal
suffrage
in
the
senate
these
provisions
were
intended
to
secure
to
every
state
and
to
the
people
of
every
state
the
right
of
representation
in
each
house
of
congress
and
so
important
was
it
deemed
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
that
the
equality
of
the
states
in
the
senate
should
be
preserved
that
not
even
by
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
can
any
state
without
its
consent
be
denied
a
voice
in
that
branch
of
the
national
legislature
it
is
true
it
has
been
assumed
that
the
existence
of
the
states
was
terminated
by
the
rebellious
acts
of
their
inhabitants
and
that
the
insurrection
having
been
suppressed
they
were
thenceforward
to
be
considered
merely
as
conquered
territories
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
departments
of
the
government
have
however
with
heat
distinctness
and
uniform
consistency
refused
to
sanction
an
assumption
so
incompatible
with
the
nature
of
our
republican
system
and
with
the
professed
objects
of
the
war
throughout
the
recent
legislation
of
congress
the
undeniable
fact
makes
itself
apparent
that
these
ten
political
communities
are
nothing
less
than
states
of
this
union
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
rebellion
each
house
declared
with
a
unanimity
as
remarkable
as
it
was
significant
that
the
war
was
not
waged
upon
our
part
in
any
spirit
of
oppression
nor
for
any
purpose
of
conquest
or
subjugation
nor
purpose
of
overthrowing
or
interfering
with
the
rights
or
established
institutions
of
those
states
but
to
defend
and
maintain
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution
and
all
laws
made
in
pursuance
thereof
and
to
preserve
the
union
with
all
the
dignity
equality
and
rights
of
the
several
states
unimpaired
and
that
as
soon
as
these
objects
were
accomplished
the
war
ought
to
cease
in
some
instances
senators
were
permitted
to
continue
their
legislative
functions
while
in
other
instances
representatives
were
elected
and
admitted
to
seats
after
their
states
had
formally
declared
their
right
to
withdraw
from
the
union
and
were
endeavoring
to
maintain
that
right
by
force
of
arms
all
of
the
states
whose
people
were
in
insurrection
as
states
were
included
in
the
apportionment
of
the
direct
tax
of
annually
laid
upon
the
united
states
by
the
act
approved
th
august
congress
by
the
act
of
march
and
by
the
apportionment
of
representation
thereunder
also
recognized
their
presence
as
states
in
the
union
and
they
have
for
judicial
purposes
been
divided
into
districts
as
states
alone
can
be
divided
the
same
recognition
appears
in
the
recent
legislation
in
reference
to
tennessee
which
evidently
rests
upon
the
fact
that
the
functions
of
the
state
were
not
destroyed
by
the
rebellion
but
merely
suspended
and
that
principle
is
of
course
applicable
to
those
states
which
like
tennessee
attempted
to
renounce
their
places
in
the
union
the
action
of
the
executive
department
of
the
government
upon
this
subject
has
been
equally
definite
and
uniform
and
the
purpose
of
the
war
was
specifically
stated
in
the
proclamation
issued
by
my
predecessor
on
the
d
day
of
september
it
was
then
solemnly
proclaimed
and
declared
that
hereafter
as
heretofore
the
war
will
be
prosecuted
for
the
object
of
practically
restoring
the
constitutional
relation
between
the
united
states
and
each
of
the
states
and
the
people
thereof
in
which
states
that
relation
is
or
may
be
suspended
or
disturbed
the
recognition
of
the
states
by
the
judicial
department
of
the
government
has
also
been
dear
and
conclusive
in
all
proceedings
affecting
them
as
states
had
in
the
supreme
circuit
and
district
courts
in
the
admission
of
senators
and
representatives
from
any
and
all
of
the
states
there
can
be
no
just
ground
of
apprehension
that
persons
who
are
disloyal
will
be
clothed
with
the
powers
of
legislation
for
this
could
not
happen
when
the
constitution
and
the
laws
are
enforced
by
a
vigilant
and
faithful
congress
each

for

that
none
but
persons
loyal
to
the

will
be
allowed
a
voice
in
the
legislative
councils
of
the
nation
and
the
political
power
and
moral
influence
of
congress
are
thus
effectively
exerted
in
the
interests
of
loyalty
to
the
government
and
fidelity
to
the
union
upon
this
question
so
vitally
affecting
the
restoration
of
the
union
and
the
permanency
of
our
present
form
of
government
my
convictions
heretofore
expressed
have
undergone
no
change
but
on
the
contrary
their
correctness
has
been
confirmed
by
reflection
and
time
if
the
admission
of
loyal
members
to
seats
in
the
respective
houses
of
congress
was
wise
and
expedient
a
year
ago
it
is
no
less
wise
and
expedient
now
if
this
anomalous
condition
is
right
nowif
in
the
exact
condition
of
these
states
at
the
present
time
it
is
lawful
to
exclude
them
from
representationi
do
not
see
that
the
question
will
be
changed
by
the
efflux
of
time
ten
years
hence
if
these
states
remain
as
they
are
the
right
of
representation
will
be
no
stronger
the
right
of
exclusion
will
be
no
weaker
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
makes
it
the
duty
of
the
president
to
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
such
measures
as
he
shall
judge
necessary
and
expedient
i
know
of
no
measure
more
imperatively
demanded
by
every
consideration
of
national
interest
sound
policy
and
equal
justice
than
the
admission
of
loyal
members
from
the
now
unrepresented
states
this
would
consummate
the
work
of
restoration
and
exert
a
most
salutary
influence
in
the
reestablishment
of
peace
harmony
and
fraternal
feeling
it
would
tend
greatly
to
renew
the
confidence
of
the
american
people
in
the
vigor
and
stability
of
their
institutions
it
would
bind
us
more
closely
together
as
a
nation
and
enable
us
to
show
to
the
world
the
inherent
and
recuperative
power
of
a
government
founded
upon
the
will
of
the
people
and
established
upon
the
principles
of
liberty
justice
and
intelligence
our
increased
strength
and
enhanced
prosperity
would
irrefragably
demonstrate
the
fallacy
of
the
arguments
against
free
institutions
drawn
from
our
recent
national
disorders
by
the
enemies
of
republican
government
the
admission
of
loyal
members
from
the
states
now
excluded
from
congress
by
allaying
doubt
and
apprehension
would
turn
capital
now
awaiting
an
opportunity
for
investment
into
the
channels
of
trade
and
industry
it
would
alleviate
the
present
troubled
condition
of
those
states
and
by
inducing
emigration
aid
in
the
settlement
of
fertile
regions
now
uncultivated
and
lead
to
an
increased
production
of
those
staples
which
have
added
so
greatly
to
the
wealth
of
the
nation
and
commerce
of
the
world
new
fields
of
enterprise
would
be
opened
to
our
progressive
people
and
soon
the
devastations
of
war
would
be
repaired
and
all
traces
of
our
domestic
differences
effaced
from
the
minds
of
our
countrymen
in
our
efforts
to
preserve
the
unity
of
government
which
constitutes
as
one
people
by
restoring
the
states
to
the
condition
which
they
held
prior
to
the
rebellion
we
should
be
cautious
lest
having
rescued
our
nation
from
perils
of
threatened
disintegration
we
resort
to
consolidation
and
in
the
end
absolute
despotism
as
a
remedy
for
the
recurrence
of
similar
troubles
the
war
having
terminated
and
with
it
all
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
powers
of
doubtful
constitutionality
we
should
hasten
to
bring
legislation
within
the
boundaries
prescribed
by
the
constitution
and
to
return
to
the
ancient
landmarks
established
by
our
fathers
for
the
guidance
of
succeeding
generations
the
constitution
which
at
any
time
exists
till
changed
by
an
explicit
and
authentic
act
of
the
whole
people
is
sacredly
obligatory
upon
all
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
the
distribution
or
modification
of
the
constitutional
powers
be
in
any
particular
wrong
let
it
be
corrected
by
an
amendment
in
the
way
which
the
constitution
designates
but
let
there
be
no
change
by
usurpation
for
it
is
the
customary
weapon
by
which
free
governments
are
destroyed
washington
spoke
these
words
to
his
countrymen
when
followed
by
their
love
and
gratitude
he
voluntarily
retired
from
the
cares
of
public
life
to
keep
in
all
things
within
the
pale
of
our
constitutional
powers
and
cherish
the
federal
union
as
the
only
rock
of
safety
were
prescribed
by
jefferson
as
rules
of
action
to
endear
to
his
countrymen
the
true
principles
of
their
constitution
and
promote
a
union
of
sentiment
and
action
equally
auspicious
to
their
happiness
and
safety
jackson
held
that
the
action
of
the
general
government
should
always
be
strictly
confined
to
the
sphere
of
its
appropriate
duties
and
justly
and
forcibly
urged
that
our
government
is
not
to
be
maintained
nor
our
union
preserved
by
invasions
of
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
several
states
in
thus
attempting
to
make
our
general
government
strong
we
make
it
weak
its
true
strength
consists
in
leaving
individuals
and
states
as
much
as
possible
to
themselves
in
making
itself
felt
not
in
its
power
but
in
its
beneficence
not
in
its
control
but
in
its
protection
not
in
binding
the
states
more
closely
to
the
center
but
leaving
each
to
move
unobstructed
in
its
proper
constitutional
orbit
these
are
the
teachings
of
men
whose
deeds
and
services
have
made
them
illustrious
and
who
long
since
withdrawn
from
the
scenes
of
life
have
left
to
their
country
the
rich
legacy
of
their
example
their
wisdom
and
their
patriotism
drawing
fresh
inspiration
from
their
lessons
let
us
emulate
them
in
love
of
country
and
respect
for
the
constitution
and
the
laws
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
affords
much
information
respecting
the
revenue
and
commerce
of
the
country
his
views
upon
the
currency
and
with
reference
to
a
proper
adjustment
of
our
revenue
system
internal
as
well
as
impost
are
commended
to
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
i
expressed
my
general
views
upon
these
subjects
i
need
now
only
call
attention
to
the
necessity
of
carrying
into
every
department
of
the
government
a
system
of
rigid
accountability
thorough
retrenchment
and
wise
economy
with
no
exceptional
nor
unusual
expenditures
the
oppressive
burdens
of
taxation
can
be
lessened
by
such
a
modification
of
our
revenue
laws
as
will
be
consistent
with
the
public
faith
and
the
legitimate
and
necessary
wants
of
the
government
the
report
presents
a
much
more
satisfactory
condition
of
our
finances
than
one
year
ago
the
most
sanguine
could
have
anticipated
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
the
th
june
the
last
year
of
the
war
the
public
debt
was
increased
and
on
the
st
of
october
it
amounted
to
on
the
st
day
of
october
it
had
been
reduced
to
the
diminution
during
a
period
of
fourteen
months
commencing
september
and
ending
october
having
been
in
the
last
annual
report
on
the
state
of
the
finances
it
was
estimated
that
during
the
three
quarters
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
the
th
of
june
last
the
debt
would
be
increased
during
that
period
however
it
was
reduced
the
receipts
of
the
year
having
been
more
and
the
expenditures
less
than
the
estimates
nothing
could
more
clearly
indicate
than
these
statements
the
extent
and
availability
of
the
national
resources
and
the
rapidity
and
safety
with
which
under
our
form
of
government
great
military
and
naval
establishments
can
be
disbanded
and
expenses
reduced
from
a
war
to
a
peace
footing
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
the
receipts
were
and
the
expenditures
leaving
an
available
surplus
of
it
is
estimated
that
the
receipts
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
the
th
june
will
be
and
that
the
expenditures
will
reach
the
sum
of
leaving
in
the
treasury
a
surplus
of
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
it
is
estimated
that
the
receipts
will
amount
to
and
that
the
expenditures
will
be
showing
an
excess
of
in
favor
of
the
government
these
estimated
receipts
may
be
diminished
by
a
reduction
of
excise
and
import
duties
but
after
all
necessary
reductions
shall
have
been
made
the
revenue
of
the
present
and
of
following
years
will
doubtless
be
sufficient
to
cover
all
legitimate
charges
upon
the
treasury
and
leave
a
large
annual
surplus
to
be
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
principal
of
the
debt
there
seems
now
to
be
no
good
reason
why
taxes
may
not
be
reduced
as
the
country
advances
in
population
and
wealth
and
yet
the
debt
be
extinguished
within
the
next
quarter
of
a
century
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
furnishes
valuable
and
important
information
in
reference
to
the
operations
of
his
department
during
the
past
year
few
volunteers
now
remain
in
the
service
and
they
are
being
discharged
as
rapidly
as
they
can
be
replaced
by
regular
troops
the
army
has
been
promptly
paid
carefully
provided
with
medical
treatment
well
sheltered
and
subsisted
and
is
to
be
furnished
with
breechloading
small
arms
the
military
strength
of
the
nation
has
been
unimpaired
by
the
discharge
of
volunteers
the
disposition
of
unserviceable
or
perishable
stores
and
the
retrenchment
of
expenditure
sufficient
war
material
to
meet
any
emergency
has
been
retained
and
from
the
disbanded
volunteers
standing
ready
to
respond
to
the
national
call
large
armies
can
be
rapidly
organized
equipped
and
concentrated
fortifications
on
the
coast
and
frontier
have
received
or
are
being
prepared
for
more
powerful
armaments
lake
surveys
and
harbor
and
river
improvements
are
in
course
of
energetic
prosecution
preparations
have
been
made
for
the
payment
of
the
additional
bounties
authorized
during
the
recent
session
of
congress
under
such
regulations
as
will
protect
the
government
from
fraud
and
secure
to
the
honorably
discharged
soldier
the
wellearned
reward
of
his
faithfulness
and
gallantry
more
than
maimed
soldiers
have
received
artificial
limbs
or
other
surgical
apparatus
and
national
cemeteries
containing
the
remains
of
union
soldiers
have
already
been
established
the
total
estimate
of
military
appropriations
is
it

is
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
that
the
naval
force
at
this
time
consists
of
vessels
armed
with
guns
of
these
vessels
carrying
guns
are
in
commission
distributed
chiefly
among
seven
squadrons
the
number
of
men
in
the
service
is
great
activity
and
vigilance
have
been
displayed
by
all
the
squadrons
and
their
movements
have
been
judiciously
and
efficiently
arranged
in
such
manner
as
would
best
promote
american
commerce
and
protect
the
rights
and
interests
of
our
countrymen
abroad
the
vessels
unemployed
are
undergoing
repairs
or
are
laid
up
until
their
services
may
be
required
most
of
the
ironclad
fleet
is
at
league
island
in
the
vicinity
of
philadelphia
a
place
which
until
decisive
action
should
be
taken
by
congress
was
selected
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
as
the
most
eligible
location
for
that
class
of
vessels
it
is
important
that
a
suitable
public
station
should
be
provided
for
the
ironclad
fleet
it
is
intended
that
these
vessels
shall
be
in
proper
condition
for
any
emergency
and
it
is
desirable
that
the
bill
accepting
league
island
for
naval
purposes
which
passed
the
house
of
representatives
at
its
last
session
should
receive
final
action
at
an
early
period
in
order
that
there
may
be
a
suitable
public
station
for
this
class
of
vessels
as
well
as
a
navyyard
of
area
sufficient
for
the
wants
of
the
service
on
the
delaware
river
the
naval
pension
fund
amounts
to
having
been
increased
during
the
year
the
expenditures
of
the
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
th
june
last
were
and
the
estimates
for
the
coming
year
amount
to
attention
is
invited
to
the
condition
of
our
seamen
and
the
importance
of
legislative
measures
for
their
relief
and
improvement
the
suggestions
in
behalf
of
this
deserving
class
of
our
fellowcitizens
are
earnestly
recommended
to
the
favorable
attention
of
congress
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
presents
a
most
satisfactory
condition
of
the
postal
service
and
submits
recommendations
which
deserve
the
consideration
of
congress
the
revenues
of
the
department
for
the
year
ending
june
were
and
the
expenditures
showing
an
excess
of
the
latter
of
in
anticipation
of
this
deficiency
however
a
special
appropriation
was
made
by
congress
in
the
act
approved
july
including
the
standing
appropriation
of
for
free
mail
matter
as
a
legitimate
portion
of
the
revenues
yet
remaining
unexpended
the
actual
deficiency
for
the
past
year
is
only
a
sum
within
of
the
amount
estimated
in
the
annual
report
of
the
decrease
of
revenue
compared
with
the
previous
year
was
per
cent
and
the
increase
of
expenditures
owing
principally
to
the
enlargement
of
the
mail
service
in
the
south
was
per
cent
on
the
th
of
june
last
there
were
in
operation
mail
routes
with
an
aggregate
length
of
miles
an
aggregate
annual
transportation
of
miles
and
an
aggregate
annual
cost
including
all
expenditures
of
the
length
of
railroad
routes
is
miles
and
the
annual
transportation
miles
the
length
of
steamboat
routes
is
miles
and
the
annual
transportation
miles
the
mail
service
is
rapidly
increasing
throughout
the
whole
country
and
its
steady
extension
in
the
southern
states
indicates
their
constantly
improving
condition
the
growing
importance
of
the
foreign
service
also
merits
attention
the
postoffice
department
of
great
britain
and
our
own
have
agreed
upon
a
preliminary
basis
for
a
new
postal
convention
which
it
is
believed
will
prove
eminently
beneficial
to
the
commercial
interests
of
the
united
states
inasmuch
as
it
contemplates
a
reduction
of
the
international
letter
postage
to
onehalf
the
existing
rates
a
reduction
of
postage
with
all
other
countries
to
and
from
which
correspondence
is
transmitted
in
the
british
mail
or
in
closed
mails
through
the
united
kingdom
the
establishment
of
uniform
and
reasonable
charges
for
the
sea
and
territorial
transit
of
correspondence
in
closed
mails
and
an
allowance
to
each
postoffice
department
of
the
right
to
use
all

communications
established
under
the
authority
of
the
other
for
the
dispatch
of
correspondence
either
in
open
or
closed
mails
on
the
same
terms
as
those
applicable
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
providing
the
means
of
transmission
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
exhibits
the
condition
of
those
branches
of
the
public
service
which
are
committed
to
his
supervision
during
the
last
fiscal
year
acres
of
public
land
were
disposed
of
acres
of
which
were
entered
under
the
homestead
act
the
policy
originally
adopted
relative
to
the
public
lands
has
undergone
essential
modifications
immediate
revenue
and
not
their
rapid
settlement
was
the
cardinal
feature
of
our
land
system
long
experience
and
earnest
discussion
have
resulted
in
the
conviction
that
the
early
development
of
our
agricultural
resources
and
the
diffusion
of
an
energetic
population
over
our
vast
territory
are
objects
of
far
greater
importance
to
the
national
growth
and
prosperity
than
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
land
to
the
highest
bidder
in
open
market
the
preemption
laws
confer
upon
the
pioneer
who
complies
with
the
terms
they
impose
the
privilege
of
purchasing
a
limited
portion
of
unoffered
lands
at
the
minimum
price
the
homestead
enactments
relieve
the
settler
from
the
payment
of
purchase
money
and
secure
him
a
permanent
home
upon
the
condition
of
residence
for
a
term
of
years
this
liberal
policy
invites
emigration
from
the
old
and
from
the
more
crowded
portions
of
the
new
world
its
propitious
results
are
undoubted
and
will
be
more
signally
manifested
when
time
shall
have
given
to
it
a
wider
development
congress
has
made
liberal
grants
of
public
land
to
corporations
in
aid
of
the
construction
of
railroads
and
other
internal
improvements
should
this
policy
hereafter
prevail
more
stringent
provisions
will
be
required
to
secure
a
faithful
application
of
the
fund
the
title
to
the
lands
should
not
pass
by
patent
or
otherwise
but
remain
in
the

and
subject
to
its
control
until
some
portion
of
the
road
has
been
actually
built
portions
of
them
might
then
from
time
to
time
be
conveyed
to
the
corporation
but
never
in
a
greater
ratio
to
the
whole
quantity
embraced
by
the
grant
than
the
completed
parts
bear
to
the
entire
length
of
the
projected
improvement
this
restriction
would
not
operate
to
the
prejudice
of
any
undertaking
conceived
in
good
faith
and
executed
with
reasonable
energy
as
it
is
the
settled
practice
to
withdraw
from
market
the
lands
falling
within
the
operation
of
such
grants
and
thus
to
exclude
the
inception
of
a
subsequent
adverse
right
a
breach
of
the
conditions
which
congress
may
deem
proper
to
impose
should
work
a
forfeiture
of
claim
to
the
lands
so
withdrawn
but
unconveyed
and
of
title
to
the
lands
conveyed
which
remain
unsold
operations
on
the
several
lines
of
the
pacific
railroad
have
been
prosecuted
with
unexampled
vigor
and
success
should
no
unforeseen
causes
of
delay
occur
it
is
confidently
anticipated
that
this
great
thoroughfare
will
be
completed
before
the
expiration
of
the
period
designated
by
congress
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
amount
paid
to
pensioners
including
the
expenses
of
disbursement
was
and
names
were
added
to
the
pension
rolls
the
entire
number
of
pensioners
june
was
this
fact
furnishes
melancholy
and
striking
proof
of
the
sacrifices
made
to
vindicate
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
federal
government
and
to
maintain
inviolate
the
integrity
of
the
union
they
impose
upon
us
corresponding
obligations
it
is
estimated
that
will
be
required
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
this
branch
of
the
service
during
the
next
fiscal
year
treaties
have
been
concluded
with
the
indians
who
enticed
into
armed
opposition
to
our
government
at
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
have
unconditionally
submitted
to
our
authority
and
manifested
an
earnest
desire
for
a
renewal
of
friendly
relations
during
the
year
ending
september
patents
for
useful
inventions
and
designs
were
issued
and
at
that
date
the
balance
in
the
treasury
to
the
credit
of
the
patent
fund
was
as
a
subject
upon
which
depends
an
immense
amount
of
the
production
and
commerce
of
the
country
i
recommend
to
congress
such
legislation
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
levees
of
the
mississippi
river
it
is
a
matter
of
national
importance
that
early
steps
should
be
taken
not
only
to
add
to
the
efficiency
of
these
barriers
against
destructive
inundations
but
for
the
removal
of
all
obstructions
to
the
free
and
safe
navigation
of
that
great
channel
of
trade
and
commerce
the
district
of
columbia
under
existing
laws
is
not
entitled
to
that
representation
in
the
national
councils
which
from
our
earliest
history
has
been
uniformly
accorded
to
each
territory
established
from
time
to
time
within
our
limits
it
maintains
peculiar
relations
to
congress
to
whom
the
constitution
has
granted
the
power
of
exercising
exclusive
legislation
over
the
seat
of
government
our
fellowcitizens
residing
in
the
district
whose
interests
are
thus
confided
to
the
special
guardianship
of
congress
exceed
in
number
the
population
of
several
of
our
territories
and
no
just
reason
is
perceived
why
a
delegate
of
their
choice
should
not
be
admitted
to
a
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
no
mode
seems
so
appropriate
and
effectual
of
enabling
them
to
make
known
their
peculiar
condition
and
wants
and
of
securing
the
local
legislation
adapted
to
them
i
therefore
recommend
the
passage
of
a
law
authorizing
the
electors
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
choose
a
delegate
to
be
allowed
the
same
rights
and
privileges
as
a
delegate
representing
a
territory
the
increasing
enterprise
and
rapid
progress
of
improvement
in
the
district
are
highly
gratifying
and
i
trust
that
the
efforts
of
the
municipal
authorities
to
promote
the
prosperity
of
the
national
metropolis
will
receive
the
efficient
and
generous
cooperation
of
congress
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
reviews
the
operations
of
his
department
during
the
past
year
and
asks
the
aid
of
congress
in
its
efforts
to
encourage
those
states
which
scourged
by
war
are
now
earnestly
engaged
in
the
re
organization
of
domestic
industry
it
is
a
subject
of
congratulation
that
no
foreign
combinations
against
our
domestic
peace
and
safety
or
our
legitimate
influence
among
the
nations
have
been
formed
or
attempted
while
sentiments
of
reconciliation
loyalty
and
patriotism
have
increased
at
home
a
more
just
consideration
of
our
national
character
and
rights
has
been
manifested
by
foreign
nations
the
entire
success
of
the
atlantic
telegraph
between
the
coast
of
ireland
and
the
province
of
newfoundland
is
an
achievement
which
has
been
justly
celebrated
in
both
hemispheres
as
the
opening
of
an
era
in
the
progress
of
civilization
there
is
reason
to
expect
that
equal
success
will
attend
and
even
greater
results
follow
the
enterprise
for
connecting
the
two
continents
through
the
pacific
ocean
by
the
projected
line
of
telegraph
between
kamchatka
and
the
russian
possessions
in
america
the
resolution
of
congress
protesting
against
pardons
by
foreign
governments
of
persons
convicted
of
infamous
offenses
on
condition
of
emigration
to
our
country
has
been
communicated
to
the
states
with
which
we
maintain
intercourse
and
the
practice
so
justly
the
subject
of
complaint
on
our
part
has
not
been
renewed
the
congratulations
of
congress
to
the
emperor
of
russia
upon
his
escape
from
attempted
assassination
have
been
presented
to
that
humane
and
enlightened
ruler
and
received
by
him
with
expressions
of
grateful
appreciation
the
executive
warned
of
an
attempt
by
spanish
american
adventurers
to
induce
the
emigration
of
freedmen
of
the
united
states
to
a
foreign
country
protested
against
the
project
as
one
which
if
consummated
would
reduce
them
to
a
bondage
even
more
oppressive
than
that
from
which
they
have
just
been
relieved
assurance
has
been
received
from
the
government
of
the
state
in
which
the
plan
was
matured
that
the
proceeding
will
meet
neither
its
encouragement
nor
approval
it
is
a
question
worthy
of
your
consideration
whether
our
laws
upon
this
subject
are
adequate
to
the
prevention
or
punishment
of
the
crime
thus
meditated
in
the
month
of
april
last
as
congress
is
aware
a
friendly
arrangement
was
made
between
the
emperor
of
france
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
the
withdrawal
from
mexico
of
the
french
expeditionary
military
forces
this
withdrawal
was
to
be
effected
in
three
detachments
the
first
of
which
it
was
understood
would
leave
mexico
in
november
now
past
the
second
in
march
next
and
the
third
and
last
in
november
immediately
upon
the
completion
of
the
evacuation
the
french
government
was
to
assume
the
same
attitude
of
nonintervention
in
regard
to
mexico
as
is
held
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
repeated
assurances
have
been
given
by
the
emperor
since
that
agreement
that
he
would
complete
the
promised
evacuation
within
the
period
mentioned
or
sooner
it
was
reasonably
expected
that
the
proceedings
thus
contemplated
would
produce
a
crisis
of
great
political
interest
in
the
republic
of
mexico
the
newly
appointed
minister
of
the
united
states
mr
campbell
was
therefore
sent
forward
on
the
th
day
of
november
last
to
assume
his
proper
functions
as
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
states
to
that
republic
it
was
also
thought
expedient
that
he
should
be
attended
in
the
vicinity
of
mexico
by
the
lieutenantgeneral
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
with
the
view
of
obtaining
such
information
as
might
be
important
to
determine
the
course
to
be
pursued
by
the
united
states
in
reestablishing
and
maintaining
necessary
and
proper
intercourse
with
the
republic
of
mexico
deeply
interested
in
the
cause
of
liberty
and
humanity
it
seemed
an
obvious
duty
on
our
part
to
exercise
whatever
influence
we
possessed
for
the
restoration
and
permanent
establishment
in
that
country
of
a
domestic
and
republican
form
of
government
such
was
the
condition
of
our
affairs
in
regard
to
mexico
when
on
the
d
of
november
last
official
information
was
received
from
paris
that
the
emperor
of
france
had
some
time
before
decided
not
to
withdraw
a
detachment
of
his
forces
in
the
month
of
november
past
according
to
engagement
but
that
this
decision
was
made
with
the
purpose
of
withdrawing
the
whole
of
those
forces
in
the
ensuing
spring
of
this
determination
however
the
united
states
had
not
received
any
notice
or
intimation
and
so
soon
as
the
information
was
received
by
the
government
care
was
taken
to
make
known
its
dissent
to
the
emperor
of
france
i
can
not
forego
the
hope
that
france
will
reconsider
the
subject
and
adopt
some
resolution
in
regard
to
the
evacuation
of
mexico
which
will
conform
as
nearly
as
practicable
with
the
existing
engagement
and
thus
meet
the
just
expectations
of
the
united
states
the
papers
relating
to
the
subject
will
be
laid
before
you
it
is
believed
that
with
the
evacuation
of
mexico
by
the
expeditionary
forces
no
subject
for
serious
differences
between
france
and
the
united
states
would
remain
the
expressions
of
the
emperor
and
people
of
france
warrant
a
hope
that
the
traditionary
friendship
between
the
two
countries
might
in
that
case
be
renewed
and
permanently
restored
a
claim
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
for
indemnity
for
spoliations
committed
on
the
high
seas
by
the
french
authorities
in
the
exercise
of
a
belligerent
power
against
mexico
has
been
met
by
the
government
of
france
with
a
proposition
to
defer
settlement
until
a
mutual
convention
for
the
adjustment
of
all
claims
of
citizens
and
subjects
of
both
countries
arising
out
of
the
recent
wars
on
this
continent
shall
be
agreed
upon
by
the
two
countries
the
suggestion
is
not
deemed
unreasonable
but
it
belongs
to
congress
to
direct
the
manner
in
which
claims
for
indemnity
by
foreigners
as
well
as
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
arising
out
of
the
late
civil
war
shall
be
adjudicated
and
determined
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
subject
of
all
such
claims
will
engage
your
attention
at
a
convenient
and
proper
time
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
that
no
considerable
advance
has
been
made
toward
an
adjustment
of
the
differences
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
arising
out
of
the
depredations
upon
our
national
commerce
and
other
trespasses
committed
during
our
civil
war
by
british
subjects
in
violation
of
international
law
and
treaty
obligations
the
delay
however
may
be
believed
to
have
resulted
in
no
small
degree
from
the
domestic
situation
of
great
britain
an
entire
change
of
ministry
occurred
in
that
country
during
the
last
session
of
parliament
the
attention
of
the
new
ministry
was
called
to
the
subject
at
an
early
day
and
there
is
some
reason
to
expect
that
it
will
now
be
considered
in
a
becoming
and
friendly
spirit
the
importance
of
an
early
disposition
of
the
question
can
not
be
exaggerated
whatever
might
be
the
wishes
of
the
two
governments
it
is
manifest
that
good
will
and
friendship
between
the
two
countries
can
not
be
established
until
a
reciprocity
in
the
practice
of
good
faith
and
neutrality
shall
be
restored
between
the
respective
nations
on
the
th
of
june
last
in
violation
of
our
neutrality
laws
a
military
expedition
and
enterprise
against
the
british
north
american
colonies
was
projected
and
attempted
to
be
carried
on
within
the
territory
and
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
in
obedience
to
the
obligation
imposed
upon
the
executive
by
the
constitution
to
see
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed
all
citizens
were
warned
by
proclamation
against
taking
part
in
or
aiding
such
unlawful
proceedings
and
the
proper
civil
military
and
naval
officers
were
directed
to
take
all
necessary
measures
for
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
the
expedition
failed
but
it
has
not
been
without
its
painful
consequences
some
of
our
citizens
who
it
was
alleged
were
engaged
in
the
expedition
were
captured
and
have
been
brought
to
trial
as
for
a
capital
offense
in
the
province
of
canada
judgment
and
sentence
of
death
have
been
pronounced
against
some
while
others
have
been
acquitted
fully
believing
in
the
maxim
of
government
that
severity
of
civil
punishment
for
misguided
persons
who
have
engaged
in
revolutionary
attempts
which
have
disastrously
failed
is
unsound
and
unwise
such
representations
have
been
made
to
the
british
government
in
behalf
of
the
convicted
persons
as
being
sustained
by
an
enlightened
and
humane
judgment
will
it
is
hoped
induce
in
their
cases
an
exercise
of
clemency
and
a
judicious
amnesty
to
all
who
were
engaged
in
the
movement
counsel
has
been
employed
by
the
government
to
defend
citizens
of
the
united
states
on
trial
for
capital
offenses
in
canada
and
a
discontinuance
of
the
prosecutions
which
were
instituted
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
against
those
who
took
part
in
the
expedition
has
been
directed
i
have
regarded
the
expedition
as
not
only
political
in
its
nature
but
as
also
in
a
great
measure
foreign
from
the
united
states
in
its
causes
character
and
objects
the
attempt
was
understood
to
be
made
in
sympathy
with
an
insurgent
party
in
ireland
and
by
striking
at
a
british
province
on
this
continent
was
designed
to
aid
in
obtaining
redress
for
political
grievances
which
it
was
assumed
the
people
of
ireland
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
british
government
during
a
period
of
several
centuries
the
persons
engaged
in
it
were
chiefly
natives
of
that
country
some
of
whom
had
while
others
had
not
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
under
our
general
laws
of
naturalization
complaints
of
misgovernment
in
ireland
continually
engage
the
attention
of
the
british
nation
and
so
great
an
agitation
is
now
prevailing
in
ireland
that
the
british
government
have
deemed
it
necessary
to
suspend
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
that
country
these
circumstances
must
necessarily
modify
the
opinion
which
we
might
otherwise
have
entertained
in
regard
to
an
expedition
expressly
prohibited
by
our
neutrality
laws
so
long
as
those
laws
remain
upon
our
statute
books
they
should
be
faithfully
executed
and
if
they
operate
harshly
unjustly
or
oppressively
congress
alone
can
apply
the
remedy
by
their
modification
or
repeal
political
and
commercial
interests
of
the
united
states
a
re
not
unlikely
to
be
affected
in
some
degree
by
events
which
are
transpiring
in
the
eastern
regions
of
europe
and
the
time
seems
to
have
come
when
our
government
ought
to
have
a
proper
diplomatic
representation
in
greece
this
government
has
claimed
for
all
persons
not
convicted
or
accused
or
suspected
of
crime
an
absolute
political
right
of
selfexpatriation
and
a
choice
of
new
national
allegiance
most
of
the
european
states
have
dissented
from
this
principle
and
have
claimed
a
right
to
hold
such
of
their
subjects
as
have
emigrated
to
and
been
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
afterwards
returned
on
transient
visits
to
their
native
countries
to
the
performance
of
military
service
in
like
manner
as
resident
subjects
complaints
arising
from
the
claim
in
this
respect
made
by
foreign
states
have
heretofore
been
matters
of
controversy
between
the
united
states
and
some
of
the
european
powers
and
the
irritation
consequent
upon
the
failure
to
settle
this
question
increased
during
the
war
in
which
prussia
italy
and
austria
were
recently
engaged
while
great
britain
has
never
acknowledged
the
right
of
expatriation
she
has
not
for
some
years
past
practically
insisted
upon
the
opposite
doctrine
france
has
been
equally
forbearing
and
prussia
has
proposed
a
compromise
which
although
evincing
increased
liberality
has
not
been
accepted
by
the
united
states
peace
is
now
prevailing
everywhere
in
europe
and
the
present
seems
to
be
a
favorable
time
for
an
assertion
by
congress
of
the
principle
so
long
maintained
by
the
executive
department
that
naturalization
by
one
state
fully
exempts
the
nativeborn
subject
of
any
other
state
from
the
performance
of
military
service
under
any
foreign
government
so
long
as
he
does
not
voluntarily
renounce
its
rights
and
benefits
in
the
performance
of
a
duty
imposed
upon
me
by
the
constitution
i
have
thus
submitted
to
the
representatives
of
the
states
and
of
the
people
such
information
of
our
domestic
and
foreign
affairs
as
the
public
interests
seem
to
require
our
government
is
now
undergoing
its
most
trying
ordeal
and
my
earnest
prayer
is
that
the
peril
may
be
successfully
and
finally
passed
without
impairing
its
original
strength
and
symmetry
the
interests
of
the
nation
are
best
to
be
promoted
by
the
revival
of
fraternal
relations
the
complete
obliteration
of
our
past
differences
and
the
reinauguration
of
all
the
pursuits
of
peace
directing
our
efforts
to
the
early
accomplishment
of
these
great
ends
let
us
endeavor
to
preserve
harmony
between
the
coordinate
departments
of
the
government
that
each
in
its
proper
sphere
may
cordially
cooperate
with
the
other
in
securing
the
maintenance
of
the
constitution
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
the
perpetuity
of
our
free
institutions

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
to
express
gratitude
to
god
in
the
name
of
the
people
for
the
preservation
of
the
united
states
is
my
first
duty
in
addressing
you
our
thoughts
next
revert
to
the
death
of
the
late
president
by
an
act
of
parricidal
treason
the
grief
of
the
nation
is
still
fresh
it
finds
some
solace
in
the
consideration
that
he
lived
to
enjoy
the
highest
proof
of
its
confidence
by
entering
on
the
renewed
term
of
the
chief
magistracy
to
which
he
had
been
elected
that
he
brought
the
civil
war
substantially
to
a
close
that
his
loss
was
deplored
in
all
parts
of
the
union
and
that
foreign
nations
have
rendered
justice
to
his
memory
his
removal
cast
upon
me
a
heavier
weight
of
cares
than
ever
devolved
upon
any
one
of
his
predecessors
to
fulfill
my
trust
i
need
the
support
and
confidence
of
all
who
are
associated
with
me
in
the
various
departments
of
government
and
the
support
and
confidence
of
the
people
there
is
but
one
way
in
which
i
can
hope
to
gain
their
necessary
aid
it
is
to
state
with
frankness
the
principles
which
guide
my
conduct
and
their
application
to
the
present
state
of
affairs
well
aware
that
the
efficiency
of
my
labors
will
in
a
great
measure
depend
on
your
and
their
undivided
approbation
the
union
of
the
united
states
of
america
was
intended
by
its
authors
to
last
as
long
as
the
states
themselves
shall
last
the
union
shall
be
perpetual
are
the
words
of
the
confederation
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
by
an
ordinance
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
is
the
declared
purpose
of
the
constitution
the
hand
of
divine
providence
was
never
more
plainly
visible
in
the
affairs
of
men
than
in
the
framing
and
the
adopting
of
that
instrument
it
is
beyond
comparison
the
greatest
event
in
american
history
and
indeed
is
it
not
of
all
events
in
modern
times
the
most
pregnant
with
consequences
for
every
people
of
the
earth
the
members
of
the
convention
which
prepared
it
brought
to
their
work
the
experience
of
the
confederation
of
their
several
states
and
of
other
republican
governments
old
and
new
but
they
needed
and
they
obtained
a
wisdom
superior
to
experience
and
when
for
its
validity
it
required
the
approval
of
a
people
that
occupied
a
large
part
of
a
continent
and
acted
separately
in
many
distinct
conventions
what
is
more
wonderful
than
that
after
earnest
contention
and
long
discussion
all
feelings
and
all
opinions
were
ultimately
drawn
in
one
way
to
its
support
the
constitution
to
which
life
was
thus
imparted
contains
within
itself
ample
resources
for
its
own
preservation
it
has
power
to
enforce
the
laws
punish
treason
and
insure
domestic
tranquillity
in
case
of
the
usurpation
of
the
government
of
a
state
by
one
man
or
an
oligarchy
it
becomes
a
duty
of
the
united
states
to
make
good
the
guaranty
to
that
state
of
a
republican
form
of
government
and
so
to
maintain
the
homogeneousness
of
all
does
the
lapse
of
time
reveal
defects
a
simple
mode
of
amendment
is
provided
in
the
constitution
itself
so
that
its
conditions
can
always
be
made
to
conform
to
the
requirements
of
advancing
civilization
no
room
is
allowed
even
for
the
thought
of
a
possibility
of
its
coming
to
an
end
and
these
powers
of
selfpreservation
have
always
been
asserted
in
their
complete
integrity
by
every
patriotic
chief
magistrate
by
jefferson
and
jackson
not
less
than
by
washington
and
madison
the
parting
advice
of
the
father
of
his
country
while
yet
president
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
was
that
the
free
constitution
which
was
the
work
of
their
hands
might
be
sacredly
maintained
and
the
inaugural
words
of
president
jefferson
held
up
the
preservation
of
the
general
government
in
its
whole
constitutional
vigor
as
the
sheet
anchor
of
our
peace
at
home
and
safety
abroad
the
constitution
is
the
work
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
it
should
be
as
indestructible
as
the
people
it
is
not
strange
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
which
had
no
model
in
the
past
should
not
have
fully
comprehended
the
excellence
of
their
own
work
fresh
from
a
struggle
against
arbitrary
power
many
patriots
suffered
from
harassing
fears
of
an
absorption
of
the
state
governments
by
the
general
government
and
many
from
a
dread
that
the
states
would
break
away
from
their
orbits
but
the
very
greatness
of
our
country
should
allay
the
apprehension
of
encroachments
by
the
general
government
the
subjects
that
come
unquestionably
within
its
jurisdiction
are
so
numerous
that
it
must
ever
naturally
refuse
to
be
embarrassed
by
questions
that
lie
beyond
it
were
it
otherwise
the
executive
would
sink
beneath
the
burden
the
channels
of
justice
would
be
choked
legislation
would
be
obstructed
by
excess
so
that
there
is
a
greater
temptation
to
exercise
some
of
the
functions
of
the
general
government
through
the
states
than
to
trespass
on
their
rightful
sphere
the
absolute
acquiescence
in
the
decisions
of
the
majority
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
enforced
by
jefferson
as
the
vital
principle
of
republics
and
the
events
of
the
last
four
years
have
established
we
will
hope
forever
that
there
lies
no
appeal
to
force
the
maintenance
of
the
union
brings
with
it
the
support
of
the
state
governments
in
all
their
rights
but
it
is
not
one
of
the
rights
of
any
state
government
to
renounce
its
own
place
in
the
union
or
to
nullify
the
laws
of
the
union
the
largest
liberty
is
to
be
maintained
in
the
discussion
of
the
acts
of
the
federal
government
but
there
is
no
appeal
from
its
laws
except
to
the
various
branches
of
that
government
itself
or
to
the
people
who
grant
to
the
members
of
the
legislative
and
of
the
executive
departments
no
tenure
but
a
limited
one
and
in
that
manner
always
retain
the
powers
of
redress
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
is
the
language
of
the
confederacy
and
not
the
language
of
the
constitution
the
latter
contains
the
emphatic
wordsthis
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
shall
be
made
in
pursuance
thereof
and
all
treaties
made
or
which
shall
be
made
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
the
judges
in
every
state
shall
be
bound
thereby
anything
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
certainly
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
a
limited
government
and
so
is
every
state
government
a
limited
government
with
us
this
idea
of
limitation
spreads
through
every
form
of
administrationgeneral
state
and
municipaland
rests
on
the
great
distinguishing
principle
of
the
recognition
of
the
rights
of
man
the
ancient
republics
absorbed
the
individual
in
the
stateprescribed
his
religion
and
controlled
his
activity
the
american
system
rests
on
the
assertion
of
the
equal
right
of
every
man
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
to
freedom
of
conscience
to
the
culture
and
exercise
of
all
his
faculties
as
a
consequence
the
state
government
is
limitedas
to
the
general
government
in
the
interest
of
union
as
to
the
individual
citizen
in
the
interest
of
freedom
states
with
proper
limitations
of
power
are
essential
to
the
existence
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
at
the
very
commencement
when
we
assumed
a
place
among
the
powers
of
the
earth
the
declaration
of
independence
was
adopted
by
states
so
also
were
the
articles
of
confederation
and
when
the
people
of
the
united
states
ordained
and
established
the
constitution
it
was
the
assent
of
the
states
one
by
one
which
gave
it
vitality
in
the
event
too
of
any
amendment
to
the
constitution
the
proposition
of
congress
needs
the
confirmation
of
states
without
states
one
great
branch
of
the
legislative
government
would
be
wanting
and
if
we
look
beyond
the
letter
of
the
constitution
to
the
character
of
our
country
its
capacity
for
comprehending
within
its
jurisdiction
a
vast
continental
empire
is
due
to
the
system
of
states
the
best
security
for
the
perpetual
existence
of
the
states
is
the
supreme
authority
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
perpetuity
of
the
constitution
brings
with
it
the
perpetuity
of
the
states
their
mutual
relation
makes
us
what
we
are
and
in
our
political
system
their
connection
is
indissoluble
the
whole
can
not
exist
without
the
parts
nor
the
parts
without
the
whole
so
long
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
endures
the
states
will
endure
the
destruction
of
the
one
is
the
destruction
of
the
other
the
preservation
of
the
one
is
the
preservation
of
the
other
i
have
thus
explained
my
views
of
the
mutual
relations
of
the
constitution
and
the
states
because
they
unfold
the
principles
on
which
i
have
sought
to
solve
the
momentous
questions
and
overcome
the
appalling
difficulties
that
met
me
at
the
very
commencement
of
my
administration
it
has
been
my
steadfast
object
to
escape
from
the
sway
of
momentary
passions
and
to
derive
a
healing
policy
from
the
fundamental
and
unchanging
principles
of
the
constitution
i
found
the
states
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
civil
war
resistance
to
the
general
government
appeared
to
have
exhausted
itself
the
united
states
had
recovered
possession
of
their
forts
and
arsenals
and
their
armies
were
in
the
occupation
of
every
state
which
had
attempted
to
secede
whether
the
territory
within
the
limits
of
those
states
should
be
held
as
conquered
territory
under
military
authority
emanating
from
the
president
as
the
head
of
the
army
was
the
first
question
that
presented
itself
for
decision
now
military
governments
established
for
an
indefinite
period
would
have
offered
no
security
for
the
early
suppression
of
discontent
would
have
divided
the
people
into
the
vanquishers
and
the
vanquished
and
would
have
envenomed
hatred
rather
than
have
restored
affection
once
established
no
precise
limit
to
their
continuance
was
conceivable
they
would
have
occasioned
an
incalculable
and
exhausting
expense
peaceful
emigration
to
and
from
that
portion
of
the
country
is
one
of
the
best
means
that
can
be
thought
of
for
the
restoration
of
harmony
and
that
emigration
would
have
been
prevented
for
what
emigrant
from
abroad
what
industrious
citizen
at
home
would
p
lace
himself
willingly
under
military
rule
the
chief
persons
who
would
have
followed
in
the
train
of
the
army
would
have
been
dependents
on
the
general
government
or
men
who
expected
profit
from
the
miseries
of
their
erring
fellowcitizens
the
powers
of
patronage
and
rule
which
would
have
been
exercised
under
the
president
over
a
vast
and
populous
and
naturally
wealthy
region
are
greater
than
unless
under
extreme
necessity
i
should
be
willing
to
intrust
to
any
one
man
they
are
such
as
for
myself
i
could
never
unless
on
occasions
of
great
emergency
consent
to
exercise
the
willful
use
of
such
powers
if
continued
through
a
period
of
years
would
have
endangered
the
purity
of
the
general
administration
and
the
liberties
of
the
states
which
remained
loyal
besides
the
policy
of
military
rule
over
a
conquered
territory
would
have
implied
that
the
states
whose
inhabitants
may
have
taken
part
in
the
rebellion
had
by
the
act
of
those
inhabitants
ceased
to
exist
but
the
true
theory
is
that
all
pretended
acts
of
secession
were
from
the
beginning
null
and
void
the
states
can
not
commit
treason
nor
screen
the
individual
citizens
who
may
have
committed
treason
any
more
than
they
can
make
valid
treaties
or
engage
in
lawful
commerce
with
any
foreign
power
the
states
attempting
to
secede
placed
themselves
in
a
condition
where
their
vitality
was
impaired
but
not
extinguished
their
functions
suspended
but
not
destroyed
but
if
any
state
neglects
or
refuses
to
perform
its
offices
there
is
the
more
need
that
the
general
government
should
maintain
all
its
authority
and
as
soon
as
practicable
resume
the
exercise
of
all
its
functions
on
this
principle
i
have
acted
and
have
gradually
and
quietly
and
by
almost
imperceptible
steps
sought
to
restore
the
rightful
energy
of
the
general
government
and
of
the
states
to
that
end
provisional
governors
have
been
appointed
for
the
states
conventions
called
governors
elected
legislatures
assembled
and
senators
and
representatives
chosen
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
the
courts
of
the
united
states
as
far
as
could
be
done
have
been
reopened
so
that
the
laws
of
the
united
states
may
be
enforced
through
their
agency
the
blockade
has
been
removed
and
the
customhouses
reestablished
in
ports
of
entry
so
that
the
revenue
of
the
united
states
may
be
collected
the
postoffice
department
renews
its
ceaseless
activity
and
the
general
government
is
thereby
enabled
to
communicate
promptly
with
its
officers
and
agents
the
courts
bring
security
to
persons
and
property
the
opening
of
the
ports
invites
the
restoration
of
industry
and
commerce
the
postoffice
renews
the
facilities
of
social
intercourse
and
of
business
and
is
it
not
happy
for
us
all
that
the
restoration
of
each
one
of
these
functions
of
the
general
government
brings
with
it
a
blessing
to
the
states
over
which
they
are
extended
is
it
not
a
sure
promise
of
harmony
and
renewed
attachment
to
the
union
that
after
all
that
has
happened
the
return
of
the
general
government
is
known
only
as
a
beneficence
i
know
very
well
that
this
policy
is
attended
with
some
risk
that
for
its
success
it
requires
at
least
the
acquiescence
of
the
states
which
it
concerns
that
it
implies
an
invitation
to
those
states
by
renewing
their
allegiance
to
the
united
states
to
resume
their
functions
as
states
of
the
union
but
it
is
a
risk
that
must
be
taken
in
the
choice
of
difficulties
it
is
the
smallest
risk
and
to
diminish
and
if
possible
to
remove
all
danger
i
have
felt
it
incumbent
on
me
to
assert
one
other
power
of
the
general
governmentthe
power
of
pardon
as
no
state
can
throw
a
defense
over
the
crime
of
treason
the
power
of
pardon
is
exclusively
vested
in
the
executive
government
of
the
united
states
in
exercising
that
power
i
have
taken
every
precaution
to
connect
it
with
the
clearest
recognition
of
the
binding
force
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
an
unqualified
acknowledgment
of
the
great
social
change
of
condition
in
regard
to
slavery
which
has
grown
out
of
the
war
the
next
step
which
i
have
taken
to
restore
the
constitutional
relations
of
the
states
has
been
an
invitation
to
them
to
participate
in
the
high
office
of
amending
the
constitution
every
patriot
must
wish
for
a
general
amnesty
at
the
earliest
epoch
consistent
with
public
safety
for
this
great
end
there
is
need
of
a
concurrence
of
all
opinions
and
the
spirit
of
mutual
conciliation
all
parties
in
the
late
terrible
conflict
must
work
together
in
harmony
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask
in
the
name
of
the
whole
people
that
on
the
one
side
the
plan
of
restoration
shall
proceed
in
conformity
with
a
willingness
to
cast
the
disorders
of
the
past
into
oblivion
and
that
on
the
other
the
evidence
of
sincerity
in
the
future
maintenance
of
the
union
shall
be
put
beyond
any
doubt
by
the
ratification
of
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
provides
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
forever
within
the
limits
of
our
country
so
long
as
the
adoption
of
this
amendment
is
delayed
so
long
will
doubt
and
jealousy
and
uncertainty
prevail
this
is
the
measure
which
will
efface
the
sad
memory
of
the
past
this
is
the
measure
which
will
most
certainly
call
population
and
capital
and
security
to
those
parts
of
the
union
that
need
them
most
indeed
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask
of
the
states
which
are
now
resuming
their
places
in
the
family
of
the
union
to
give
this
pledge
of
perpetual
loyalty
and
peace
until
it
is
done
the
past
however
much
we
may
desire
it
will
not
be
forgotten
the
adoption
of
the
amendment
reunites
us
beyond
all
power
of
disruption
it
heals
the
wound
that
is
still
imperfectly
closed
it
removes
slavery
the
element
which
has
so
long
perplexed
and
divided
the
country
it
makes
of
us
once
more
a
united
people
renewed
and
strengthened
bound
more
than
ever
to
mutual
affection
and
support
the
amendment
to
the
constitution
being
adopted
it
would
remain
for
the
states
whose
powers
have
been
so
long
in
abeyance
to
resume
their
places
in
the
two
branches
of
the
national
legislature
and
thereby
complete
the
work
of
restoration
here
it
is
for
you
fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
for
you
fellowcitizens
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
judge
each
of
you
for
yourselves
of
the
elections
returns
and
qualifications
of
your
own
members
the
full
assertion
of
the
powers
of
the
general
government
requires
the
holding
of
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
within
the
districts
where
their
authority
has
been
interrupted
in
the
present
posture
of
our
public
affairs
strong
objections
have
been
urged
to
holding
those
courts
in
any
of
the
states
where
the
rebellion
has
existed
and
it
was
ascertained
by
inquiry
that
the
circuit
court
of
the
united
states
would
not
be
held
within
the
district
of
virginia
during
the
autumn
or
early
winter
nor
until
congress
should
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
and
act
on
the
whole
subject
to
your
deliberations
the
restoration
of
this
branch
of
the
civil
authority
of
the
united
states
is
therefore
necessarily
referred
with
the
hope
that
early
provision
will
be
made
for
the
resumption
of
all
its
functions
it
is
manifest
that
treason
most
flagrant
in
character
has
been
committed
persons
who
are
charged
with
its
commission
should
have
fair
and
impartial
trials
in
the
highest
civil
tribunals
of
the
country
in
order
that
the
constitution
and
the
laws
may
be
fully
vindicated
the
truth
dearly
established
and
affirmed
that
treason
is
a
crime
that
traitors
should
be
punished
and
the
offense
made
infamous
and
at
the
same
time
that
the
question
may
be
judicially
settled
finally
and
forever
that
no
state
of
its
own
will
has
the
right
to
renounce
its
place
in
the
union
the
relations
of
the
general
government
toward
the
inhabitants
whom
the
war
has
called
into
freedom
have
engaged
my
most
serious
consideration
on
the
propriety
of
attempting
to
make
the
freedmen
electors
by
the
proclamation
of
the
executive
i
took
for
my
counsel
the
constitution
itself
the
interpretations
of
that
instrument
by
its
authors
and
their
contemporaries
and
recent
legislation
by
congress
when
at
the
first
movement
toward
independence
the
congress
of
the
united
states
instructed
the
several
states
to
institute
governments
of
their
own
they
left
each
state
to
decide
for
itself
the
conditions
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
elective
franchise
during
the
period
of
the
confederacy
there
continued
to
exist
a
very
great
diversity
in
the
qualifications
of
electors
in
the
several
states
and
even
within
a
state
a
distinction
of
qualifications
prevailed
with
regard
to
the
officers
who
were
to
be
chosen
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
recognizes
these
diversities
when
it
enjoins
that
in
the
choice
of
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
united
states
the
electors
in
each
state
shall
have
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
after
the
formation
of
the
constitution
it
remained
as
before
the
uniform
usage
for
each
state
to
enlarge
the
body
of
its
electors
according
to
its
own
judgment
and
under
this
system
one
state
after
another
has
proceeded
to
increase
the
number
of
its
electors
until
now
universal
suffrage
or
something
very
near
it
is
the
general
rule
so
fixed
was
this
reservation
of
power
in
the
habits
of
the
people
and
so
unquestioned
has
been
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
that
during
the
civil
war
the
late
president
never
harbored
the
purposecertainly
never
avowed
the
purposeof
disregarding
it
and
in
the
acts
of
congress
during
that
period
nothing
can
be
found
which
during
the
continuance
of
hostilities
much
less
after
their
close
would
have
sanctioned
any
departure
by
the
executive
from
a
policy
which
has
so
uniformly
obtained
moreover
a
concession
of
the
elective
franchise
to
the
freedmen
by
act
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
must
have
been
extended
to
all
colored
men
wherever
found
and
so
must
have
established
a
change
of
suffrage
in
the
northern
middle
and
western
states
not
less
than
in
the
southern
and
southwestern
such
an
act
would
have
created
a
new
clas
s
of
voters
and
would
have
been
an
assumption
of
power
by
the
president
which
nothing
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
would
have
warranted
on
the
other
hand
every
danger
of
conflict
is
avoided
when
the
settlement
of
the
question
is
referred
to
the
several
states
they
can
each
for
itself
decide
on
the
measure
and
whether
it
is
to
be
adopted
at
once
and
absolutely
or
introduced
gradually
and
with
conditions
in
my
judgment
the
freedmen
if
they
show
patience
and
manly
virtues
will
sooner
obtain
a
participation
in
the
elective
franchise
through
the
states
than
through
the
general
government
even
if
it
had
power
to
intervene
when
the
tumult
of
emotions
that
have
been
raised
by
the
suddenness
of
the
social
change
shall
have
subsided
it
may
prove
that
they
will
receive
the
kindest
usage
from
some
of
those
on
whom
they
have
heretofore
most
closely
depended
but
while
i
have
no
doubt
that
now
after
the
close
of
the
war
it
is
not
competent
for
the
general
government
to
extend
the
elective
franchise
in
the
several
states
it
is
equally
clear
that
good
faith
requires
the
security
of
the
freedmen
in
their
liberty
and
their
property
their
right
to
labor
and
their
right
to
claim
the
just
return
of
their
labor
i
can
not
too
strongly
urge
a
dispassionate
treatment
of
this
subject
which
should
be
carefully
kept
aloof
from
all
party
strife
we
must
equally
avoid
hasty
assumptions
of
any
natural
impossibility
for
the
two
races
to
live
side
by
side
in
a
state
of
mutual
benefit
and
good
will
the
experiment
involves
us
in
no
inconsistency
let
us
then
go
on
and
make
that
experiment
in
good
faith
and
not
be
too
easily
disheartened
the
country
is
in
need
of
labor
and
the
freedmen
are
in
need
of
employment
culture
and
protection
while
their
right
of
voluntary
migration
and
expatriation
is
not
to
be
questioned
i
would
not
advise
their
forced
removal
and
colonization
let
us
rather
encourage
them
to
honorable
and
useful
industry
where
it
may
be
beneficial
to
themselves
and
to
the
country
and
instead
of
hasty
anticipations
of
the
certainty
of
failure
let
there
be
nothing
wanting
to
the
fair
trial
of
the
experiment
the
change
in
their
condition
is
the
substitution
of
labor
by
contract
for
the
status
of
slavery
the
freedman
can
not
fairly
be
accused
of
unwillingness
to
work
so
long
as
a
doubt
remains
about
his
freedom
of
choice
in
his
pursuits
and
the
certainty
of
his
recovering
his
stipulated
wages
in
this
the
interests
of
the
employer
and
the
employed
coincide
the
employer
desires
in
his
workmen
spirit
and
alacrity
and
these
can
be
permanently
secured
in
no
other
way
and
if
the
one
ought
to
be
able
to
enforce
the
contract
so
ought
the
other
the
public
interest
will
be
best
promoted
if
the
several
states
will
provide
adequate
protection
and
remedies
for
the
freedmen
until
this
is
in
some
way
accomplished
there
is
no
chance
for
the
advantageous
use
of
their
labor
and
the
blame
of
ill
success
will
not
rest
on
them
i
know
that
sincere
philanthropy
is
earnest
for
the
immediate
realization
of
its
remotest
aims
but
time
is
always
an
element
in
reform
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
acts
on
record
to
have
brought
people
into
freedom
the
career
of
free
industry
must
be
fairly
opened
to
them
and
then
their
future
prosperity
and
condition
must
after
all
rest
mainly
on
themselves
if
they
fail
and
so
perish
away
let
us
be
careful
that
the
failure
shall
not
be
attributable
to
any
denial
of
justice
in
all
that
relates
to
the
destiny
of
the
freedmen
we
need
not
be
too
anxious
to
read
the
future
many
incidents
which
from
a
speculative
point
of
view
might
raise
alarm
will
quietly
settle
themselves
now
that
slavery
is
at
an
end
or
near
its
end
the
greatness
of
its
evil
in
the
point
of
view
of
public
economy
becomes
more
and
more
apparent
slavery
was
essentially
a
monopoly
of
labor
and
as
such
locked
the
states
where
it
prevailed
against
the
incoming
of
free
industry
where
labor
was
the
property
of
the
capitalist
the
white
man
was
excluded
from
employment
or
had
but
the
second
best
chance
of
finding
it
and
the
foreign
emigrant
turned
away
from
the
region
where
his
condition
would
be
so
precarious
with
the
destruction
of
the
monopoly
free
labor
will
hasten
from
all
pans
of
the
civilized
world
to
assist
in
developing
various
and
immeasurable
resources
which
have
hitherto
lain
dormant
the
eight
or
nine
states
nearest
the
gulf
of
mexico
have
a
soil
of
exuberant
fertility
a
climate
friendly
to
long
life
and
can
sustain
a
denser
population
than
is
found
as
yet
in
any
part
of
our
country
and
the
future
influx
of
population
to
them
will
be
mainly
from
the
north
or
from
the
most
cultivated
nations
in
europe
from
the
sufferings
that
have
attended
them
during
our
late
struggle
let
us
look
away
to
the
future
which
is
sure
to
be
laden
for
them
with
greater
prosperity
than
has
ever
before
been
known
the
removal
of
the
monopoly
of
slave
labor
is
a
pledge
that
those
regions
will
be
peopled
by
a
numerous
and
enterprising
population
which
will
vie
with
any
in
the
union
in
compactness
inventive
genius
wealth
and
industry
our
government
springs
from
and
was
made
for
the
peoplenot
the
people
for
the
government
to
them
it
owes
allegiance
from
them
it
must
derive
its
courage
strength
and
wisdom
but
while
the
government
is
thus
bound
to
defer
to
the
people
from
whom
it
derives
its
existence
it
should
from
the
very
consideration
of
its
origin
be
strong
in
its
power
of
resistance
to
the
establishment
of
inequalities
monopolies
perpetuities
and
class
legislation
are
contrary
to
the
genius
of
free
government
and
ought
not
to
be
allowed
here
there
is
no
room
for
favored
classes
or
monopolies
the
principle
of
our
government
is
that
of
equal
laws
and
freedom
of
industry
wherever
monopoly
attains
a
foothold
it
is
sure
to
be
a
source
of
danger
discord
and
trouble
we
shall
but
fulfill
our
duties
as
legislators
by
according
equal
and
exact
justice
to
all
men
special
privileges
to
none
the
government
is
subordinate
to
the
people
but
as
the
agent
and
representative
of
the
people
it
must
be
held
superior
to
monopolies
which
in
themselves
ought
never
to
be
granted
and
which
where
they
exist
must
be
subordinate
and
yield
to
the
government
the
constitution
confers
on
congress
the
right
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states
it
is
of
the
first
necessity
for
the
maintenance
of
the
union
that
that
commerce
should
be
free
and
unobstructed
no
state
can
be
justified
in
any
device
to
tax
the
transit
of
travel
and
commerce
between
states
the
position
of
many
states
is
such
that
if
they
were
allowed
to
take
advantage
of
it
for
purposes
of
local
revenue
the
commerce
between
states
might
be
injuriously
burdened
or
even
virtually
prohibited
it
is
best
while
the
country
is
still
young
and
while
the
tendency
to
dangerous
monopolies
of
this
kind
is
still
feeble
to
use
the
power
of
congress
so
as
to
prevent
any
selfish
impediment
to
the
free
circulation
of
men
and
merchandise
a
tax
on
travel
and
merchandise
in
their
transit
constitutes
one
of
the
worst
forms
of
monopoly
and
the
evil
is
increased
if
coupled
with
a
denial
of
the
choice
of
route
when
the
vast
extent
of
our
country
is
considered
it
is
plain
that
every
obstacle
to
the
free
circulation
of
commerce
between
the
states
ought
to
be
sternly
guarded
against
by
appropriate
legislation
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the

to
matters
of
local
interest

it
also
presents
evidence
of
the
successful
operation
of
the
homestead
act
under
the
provisions
of
which
acres
of
the
public
lands
were
entered

last
fiscal
yearmore
than
onefourth
of
the
whole
number
of
acres
sold

otherwise
disposed
of
during
that
period
it
is
estimated
that
the

derived
from

source
are
sufficient
to
cover
the
expenses
incident
to
the
survey
and
disposal
of
the

entered
under
this
act
and
that

in
cash
to

thus
at

acquire
title
before

expiration
of
the
period
at
which
it
would
otherwise
vest
the
homestead
policy
was
established
only
after
long
and
earnest
resistance
experience
proves
its
wisdom
the
lands
in
the
hands
of
industrious
settlers
whose
labor
creates
wealth
and
contributes
to
the
public
resources
are
worth
more
to
the
united
states
than
if
they
had
been
reserved
as
a
solitude
for
future
purchasers
the
lamentable
events
of
the
last
four
years
and
the
sacrifices
made
by
the
gallant
men
of

have
swelled

on

the

their
object

recommended
to

of

since
the
suppression
of
active
hostilities
our
foreign
squadrons
have
been
reestablished
and
consist
of
vessels
much
more
efficient
than
those
employed
on
similar
service
previous
to
the
rebellion
the
suggestion
for
the
enlargement
of
the
navyyards
and
especially
for
the
establishment
of
one
in
fresh
water
for
ironclad
vessels
is
deserving
of
consideration
as
is
also
the
recommendation
for
a
different
location
and
more
ample
grounds
for
the
naval
academy
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
a
general
summary
is
given
of
the
military
campaigns
of
and
ending
in
the
suppression
of
armed
resistance
to
the
national
authority
in
the
insurgent
states
the
operations
of
the
general
administrative
bureaus
of
the
war
department
during
the
past
year
are
detailed
and
an
estimate
made
of
the
appropriations
that
will
be
required
for
military
purposes
in
the
fiscal
year
commencing
the
st
day
of
july
the
national
military
force
on
the
st
of
may
numbered
men
it
is
proposed
to
reduce
the
military
establishment
to
a
peace
footing
comprehending
troops
of
all
arms
organized
so
as
to
admit
of
an
enlargement
by
filling
up
the
ranks
to
if
the
circumstances
of
the
country
should
require
an
augmentation
of
the
army
the
volunteer
force
has
already
been
reduced
by
the
discharge
from
service
of
over
troops
and
the
department
is
proceeding
rapidly
in
the
work
of
further
reduction
the
war
estimates
are
reduced
from
to
which
amount
in
the
opinion
of
the
department
is
adequate
for
a
peace
establishment
the
measures
of
retrenchment
in
each
bureau
and
branch
of
the
service
exhibit
a
diligent
economy
worthy
of
commendation
reference
is
also
made
in
the
report
to
the
necessity
of
providing
for
a
uniform
militia
system
and
to
the
propriety
of
making
suitable
provision
for
wounded
and
disabled
officers
and
soldiers
the
revenue
system
of
the
country
is
a
subject
of
vital
interest
to
its
honor
and
prosperity
and
should
command
the
earnest
consideration
of
congress
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
lay
before
you
a
full
and
detailed
report
of
the
receipts
and
disbursements
of
the
last
fiscal
year
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
fiscal
year
of
the
probable
receipts
and
expenditures
for
the
other
three
quarters
and
the
estimates
for
the
year
following
the
th
of
june
i
might
content
myself
with
a
reference
to
that
report
in
which
you
will
find
all
the
information
required
for
your
deliberations
and
decision
but
the
paramount
importance
of
the
subject
so
presses
itself
on
my
own
mind
that
i
can
not
but
lay
before
you
my
views
of
the
measures
which
are
required
for
the
good
character
and
i
might
almost
say
for
the
existence
of
this
people
the
life
of
a
republic
lies
certainly
in
the
energy
virtue
and
intelligence
of
its
citizens
but
it
is
equally
true
that
a
good
revenue
system
is
the
life
of
an
organized
government
i
meet
you
at
a
time
when
the
nation
has
voluntarily
burdened
itself
with
a
debt
unprecedented
in
our
annals
vast
as
is
its
amount
it
fades
away
into
nothing
when
compared
with
the
countless
blessings
that
will
be
conferred
upon
our
country
and
upon
man
by
the
preservation
of
the
nations
life
now
on
the
first
occasion
of
the
meeting
of
congress
since
the
return
of
peace
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
inaugurate
a
just
policy
which
shall
at
once
be
put
in
motion
and
which
shall
commend
itself
to
those
who
come
after
us
for
its
continuance
we
must
aim
at
nothing
less
than
the
complete
effacement
of
the
financial
evils
that
necessarily
followed
a
state
of
civil
war
we
must
endeavor
to
apply
the
earliest
remedy
to
the
deranged
state
of
the
currency
and
not
shrink
from
devising
a
policy
which
without
being
oppressive
to
the
people
shall
immediately
begin
to
effect
a
reduction
of
the
debt
and
if
persisted
in
discharge
it
fully
within
a
definitely
fixed
number
of
years
it
is
our
first
duty
to
prepare
in
earnest
for
our
recovery
from
the
everincreasing
evils
of
an
irredeemable
currency
without
a
sudden
revulsion
and
yet
without
untimely
procrastination
for
that
end
we
must
each
in
our
respective
positions
prepare
the
way
i
hold
it
the
duty
of
the
executive
to
insist
upon
frugality
in
the
expenditures
and
a
sparing
economy
is
itself
a
great
national
resource
of
the
banks
to
which
authority
has
been
given
to
issue
notes
secured
by
bonds
of
the
united
states
we
may
require
the
greatest
moderation
and
prudence
and
the
law
must
be
rigidly
enforced
when
its
limits
are
exceeded
we
may
each
one
of
us
counsel
our
active
and
enterprising
countrymen
to
be
constantly
on
their
guard
to
liquidate
debts
contracted
in
a
paper
currency
and
by
conducting
business
as
nearly
as
possible
on
a
system
of
cash
payments
or
short
credits
to
hold
themselves
prepared
to
return
to
the
standard
of
gold
and
silver
to
aid
our
fellowcitizens
in
the
prudent
management
of
their
monetary
affairs
the
duty
devolves
on
us
to
diminish
by
law
the
amount
of
paper
money
now
in
circulation
five
years
ago
the
banknote
circulation
of
the
country
amounted
to
not
much
more
than
two
hundred
millions
now
the
circulation
bank
and
national
exceeds
seven
hundred
millions
the
simple
statement
of
the
fact
recommends
more
strongly
than
any
words
of
mine
could
do
the
necessity
of
our
restraining
this
expansion
the
gradual
reduction
of
the
currency
is
the
only
measure
that
can
save
the
business
of
the
country
from
disastrous
calamities
and
this
can
be
almost
imperceptibly
accomplished
by
gradually
funding
the
national
circulation
in
securities
that
may
be
made
redeemable
at
the
pleasure
of
the
government
our
debt
is
doubly
securefirst
in
the
actual
wealth
and
still
greater
undeveloped
resources
of
the
country
and
next
in
the
character
of
our
institutions
the
most
intelligent
observers
among
political
economists
have
not
failed
to
remark
that
the
public
debt
of
a
country
is
safe
in
proportion
as
its
people
are
free
that
the
debt
of
a
republic
is
the
safest
of
all
our
history
confirms
and
establishes
the
theory
and
is
i
firmly
believe
destined
to
give
it
a
still
more
signal
illustration
the
secret
of
this
superiority
springs
not
merely
from
the
fact
that
in
a
republic
the
national
obligations
are
distributed
more
widely
through
countless
numbers
in
all
classes
of
society
it
has
its
root
in
the
character
of
our
laws
here
all
men
contribute
to
the
public
welfare
and
bear
their
fair
share
of
the
public
burdens
during
the
war
under
the
impulses
of
patriotism
the
men
of
the
great
body
of
the
people
without
regard
to
their
own
comparative
want
of
wealth
thronged
to
our
armies
and
filled
our
fleets
of
war
and
held
themselves
ready
to
offer
their
lives
for
the
public
good
now
in
their
turn
the
property
and
income
of
the
country
should
bear
their
just
proportion
of
the
burden
of
taxation
while
in
our
impost
system
through
means
of
which
increased
vitality
is
incidentally
imparted
to
all
the
industrial
interests
of
the
nation
the
duties
should
be
so
adjusted
as
to
fall
most
heavily
on
articles
of
luxury
leaving
the
necessaries
of
life
as
free
from
taxation
as
the
absolute
wants
of
the
government
economically
administered
will
justify
no
favored
class
should
demand
freedom
from
assessment
and
the
taxes
should
be
so
distributed
as
not
to
fall
unduly
on
the
poor
but
rather
on
the
accumulated
wealth
of
the
country
we
should
look
at
the
national
debt
just
as
it
isnot
as
a
national
blessing
but
as
a
heavy
burden
on
the
industry
of
the
country
to
be
discharged
without
unnecessary
delay
it
is
estimated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
the
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
the
th
of
june
will
exceed
the
receipts
it
is
gratifying
however
to
state
that
it
is
also
estimated
that
the
revenue
for
the
year
ending
the
th
of
june
will
exceed
the
expenditures
in
the
sum
of
this
amount
or
so
much
as
may
be
deemed
sufficient
for
the
purpose
may
be
applied
to
the
reduction
of
the
public
debt
which
on
the
st
day
of
october
was
every
reduction
will
diminish
the
total
amount
of
interest
to
be
paid
and
so
enlarge
the
means
of
still
further
reductions
until
the
whole
shall
be
liquidated
and
this
as
will
be
seen
from
the
estimates
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
may
be
accomplished
by
annual
payments
even
within
a
period
not
exceeding
thirty
years
i
have
faith
that
we
shall
do
all
this
within
a
reasonable
time
that
as
we
have
amazed
the
world
by
the
suppression
of
a
civil
war
which
was
thought
to
be
beyond
the
control
of
any
government
so
we
shall
equally
show
the
superiority
of
our
institutions
by
the
prompt
and
faithful
discharge
of
our
national
obligations
the
department
of
agriculture
under
its
present
direction
is
accomplishing
much
in
developing
and
utilizing
the
vast
agricultural
capabilities
of
the
country
and
for
information
respecting
the
details
of
its
management
reference
is
made
to
the
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
i
have
dwelt
thus
fully
on
our
domestic
affairs
because
of
their
transcendent
importance
under
any
circumstances
our
great
extent
of
territory
and
variety
of
climate
producing
almost
everything
that
is
necessary
for
the
wants
and
even
the
comforts
of
ma
n
make
us
singularly
independent
of
the
varying
policy
of
foreign
powers
and
protect
us
against
every
temptation
to
entangling
alliances
while
at
the
present
moment
the
reestablishment
of
harmony
and
the
strength
that
comes
from
harmony
will
be
our
best
security
against
nations
who
feel
power
and
forget
right
for
myself
it
has
been
and
it
will
be
my
constant
aim
to
promote
peace
and
amity
with
all
foreign
nations
and
powers
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
all
without
exception
are
animated
by
the
same
disposition
our
relations
with
the
emperor
of
china
so
recent
in
their
origin
are
most
friendly
our
commerce
with
his
dominions
is
receiving
new
developments
and
it
is
very
pleasing
to
find
that
the
government
of
that
great
empire
manifests
satisfaction
with
our
policy
and
reposes
just
confidence
in
the
fairness
which
marks
our
intercourse
the
unbroken
harmony
between
the
united
states
and
the
emperor
of
russia
is
receiving
a
new
support
from
an
enterprise
designed
to
carry
telegraphic
lines
across
the
continent
of
asia
through
his
dominions
and
so
to
connect
us
with
all
europe
by
a
new
channel
of
intercourse
our
commerce
with
south
america
is
about
to
receive
encouragement
by
a
direct
line
of
mail
steamships
to
the
rising
empire
of
brazil
the
distinguished
party
of
men
of
science
who
have
recently
left
our
country
to
make
a
scientific
exploration
of
the
natural
history
and
rivers
and
mountain
ranges
of
that
region
have
received
from
the
emperor
that
generous
welcome
which
was
to
have
been
expected
from
his
constant
friendship
for
the
united
states
and
his
wellknown
zeal
in
promoting
the
advancement
of
knowledge
a
hope
is
entertained
that
our
commerce
with
the
rich
and
populous
countries
that
border
the
mediterranean
sea
may
be
largely
increased
nothing
will
be
wanting
on
the
part
of
this
government
to
extend
the
protection
of
our
flag
over
the
enterprise
of
our
fellowcitizens
we
receive
from
the
powers
in
that
region
assurances
of
good
will
and
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
a
special
envoy
has
brought
us
messages
of
condolence
on
the
death
of
our
late
chief
magistrate
from
the
bey
of
tunis
whose
rule
includes
the
old
dominions
of
carthage
on
the
african
coast
our
domestic
contest
now
happily
ended
has
left
some
traces
in
our
relations
with
one
at
least
of
the
great
maritime
powers
the
formal
accordance
of
belligerent
rights
to
the
insurgent
states
was
unprecedented
and
has
not
been
justified
by
the
issue
but
in
the
systems
of
neutrality
pursued
by
the
powers
which
made
that
concession
there
was
a
marked
difference
the
materials
of
war
for
the
insurgent
states
were
furnished
in
a
great
measure
from
the
workshops
of
great
britain
and
british
ships
manned
by
british
subjects
and
prepared
for
receiving
british
armaments
sallied
from
the
ports
of
great
britain
to
make
war
on
american
commerce
under
the
shelter
of
a
commission
from
the
insurgent
states
these
ships
having
once
escaped
from
british
ports
ever
afterwards
entered
them
in
every
part
of
the
world
to
refit
and
so
to
renew
their
depredations
the
consequences
of
this
conduct
were
most
disastrous
to
the
states
then
in
rebellion
increasing
their
desolation
and
misery
by
the
prolongation
of
our
civil
contest
it
had
moreover
the
effect
to
a
great
extent
to
drive
the
american
flag
from
the
sea
and
to
transfer
much
of
our
shipping
and
our
commerce
to
the
very
power
whose
subjects
had
created
the
necessity
for
such
a
change
these
events
took
place
before
i
was
called
to
the
administration
of
the
government
the
sincere
desire
for
peace
by
which
i
am
animated
led
me
to
approve
the
proposal
already
made
to
submit
the
question
which
had
thus
arisen
between
the
countries
to
arbitration
these
questions
are
of
such
moment
that
they
must
have
commanded
the
attention
of
the
great
powers
and
are
so
interwoven
with
the
peace
and
interests
of
every
one
of
them
as
to
have
insured
an
impartial
decision
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
great
britain
declined
the
arbitrament
but
on
the
other
hand
invited
us
to
the
formation
of
a
joint
commission
to
settle
mutual
claims
between
the
two
countries
from
which
those
for
the
depredations
before
mentioned
should
be
excluded
the
proposition
in
that
very
unsatisfactory
form
has
been
declined
the
united
states
did
not
present
the
subject
as
an
impeachment
of
the
good
faith
of
a
power
which
was
professing
the
most
friendly
dispositions
but
as
involving
questions
of
public
law
of
which
the
settlement
is
essential
to
the
peace
of
nations
and
though
pecuniary
reparation
to
their
injured
citizens
would
have
followed
incidentally
on
a
decision
against
great
britain
such
compensation
was
not
their
primary
object
they
had
a
higher
motive
and
it
was
in
the
interests
of
peace
and
justice
to
establish
important
principles
of
international
law
the
correspondence
will
be
placed
before
you
the
ground
on
which
the
british
minister
rests
his
justification
is
substantially
that
the
municipal
law
of
a
nation
and
the
domestic
interpretations
of
that
law
are
the
measure
of
its
duty
as
a
neutral
and
i
feel
bound
to
declare
my
opinion
before
you
and
before
the
world
that
that
justification
can
not
be
sustained
before
the
tribunal
of
nations
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
advise
to
any
present
attempt
at
redress
by
acts
of
legislation
for
the
future
friendship
between
the
two
countries
must
rest
on
the
basis
of
mutual
justice
from
the
moment
of
the
establishment
of
our
free
constitution
the
civilized
world
has
been
convulsed
by
revolutions
in
the
interests
of
democracy
or
of
monarchy
but
through
all
those
revolutions
the
united
states
have
wisely
and
firmly
refused
to
become
propagandists
of
republicanism
it
is
the
only
government
suited
to
our
condition
but
we
have
never
sought
to
impose
it
on
others
and
we
have
consistently
followed
the
advice
of
washington
to
recommend
it
only
by
the
careful
preservation
and
prudent
use
of
the
blessing
during
all
the
intervening
period
the
policy
of
european
powers
and
of
the
united
states
has
on
the
whole
been
harmonious
twice
indeed
rumors
of
the
invasion
of
some
parts
of
america
in
the
interest
of
monarchy
have
prevailed
twice
my
predecessors
have
had
occasion
to
announce
the
views
of
this
nation
in
respect
to
such
interference
on
both
occasions
the
remonstrance
of
the
united
states
was
respected
from
a
deep
conviction
on
the
part
of
european
governments
that
the
system
of
noninterference
and
mutual
abstinence
from
propagandism
was
the
true
rule
for
the
two
hemispheres
since
those
times
we
have
advanced
in
wealth
and
power
but
we
retain
the
same
purpose
to
leave
the
nations
of
europe
to
choose
their
own
dynasties
and
form
their
own
systems
of
government
this
consistent
moderation
may
justly
demand
a
corresponding
moderation
we
should
regard
it
as
a
great
calamity
to
ourselves
to
the
cause
of
good
government
and
to
the
peace
of
the
world
should
any
european
power
challenge
the
american
people
as
it
were
to
the
defense
of
republicanism
against
foreign
interference
we
can
not
foresee
and
are
unwilling
to
consider
what
opportunities
might
present
themselves
what
combinations
might
offer
to
protect
ourselves
against
designs
inimical
to
our
form
of
government
the
united
states
desire
to
act
in
the
future
as
they
have
ever
acted
heretofore
they
never
will
be
driven
from
that
course
but
by
the
aggression
of
european
powers
and
we
rely
on
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
those
powers
to
respect
the
system
of
noninterference
which
has
so
long
been
sanctioned
by
time
and
which
by
its
good
results
has
approved
itself
to
both
continents
the
correspondence
between
the
united
states
and
france
in
reference
to
questions
which
have
become
subjects
of
discussion
between
the
two
governments
will
at
a
proper
time
be
laid
before
congress
when
on
the
organization
of
our
government
under
the
constitution
the
president
of
the
united
states
delivered
his
inaugural
address
to
the
two
houses
of
congress
he
said
to
them
and
through
them
to
the
country
and
to
mankind
thatthe
preservation
of
the
sacred
fire
of
liberty
and
the
destiny
of
the
republican
model
of
government
are
justly
considered
perhaps
as
deeply
as
finally
staked
on
the
experiment
intrusted
to
the
hands
of
the
american
people
and
the
house
of
representatives
answered
washington
by
the
voice
of
madison
we
adore
the
invisible
hand
which
has
led
the
american
people
through
so
many
difficulties
to
cherish
a
conscious
responsibility
for
the
destiny
of
republican
liberty
more
than
seventysix
years
have
glided
away
since
these
words
were
spoken
the
united
states
have
passed
through
severer
trials
than
were
foreseen
and
now
at
this
new
epoch
in
our
existence
as
one
nation
with
our
union
purified
by
sorrows
and
strengthened
by
conflict
and
established
by
the
virtue
of
the
people
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
invites
us
once
more
to
repeat
with
solemnity
the
pledges
of
our
fathers
to
hold
ourselves
answerable
before
our
fellowmen
for
the
success
of
the
republican
form
of
government
experience
has
proved
its
sufficiency
in
peace
and
in
war
it
has
vindicated
its
authority
through
dangers
and
afflictions
and
sudden
and
terrible
emergencies
which
would
have
crushed
any
system
that
had
been
less
firmly
fixed
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
at
the
inauguration
of
washington
the
foreign
relations
of
the
country
were
few
and
its
trade
was
repressed
by
hostile
regulations
now
all
the
civilized
nations
of
the
globe
welcome
our
commerce
and
their
governments
profess
toward
us
amity
then
our
country
felt
its
way
hesitatingly
along
an
untried
path
with
states
so
little
bound
together
by
rapid
means
of
communication
as
to
be
hardly
known
to
one
another
and
with
historic
traditions
extending
over
very
few
years
now
intercourse
between
the
states
is
swift
and
intimate
the
experience
of
centuries
has
been
crowded
into
a
few
generations
and
has
created
an
intense
indestructible
nationality
then
our
jurisdiction
did
not
reach
beyond
the
inconvenient
boundaries
of
the
territory
which
had
achieved
independence
now
through
cessions

of
lands
first
colonized
by
spain
and
france
the
country
has
acquired
a
more
complex
character
and
has
for
its
natural
limits
the
chain
of
lakes
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
on
the
east
and
the
west
the
two
great
oceans
other
nations
were
wasted
by
civil
wars
for
ages
before
they
could
establish
for
themselves
the
necessary
degree
of
unity
the
latent
conviction
that
our
form
of
government
is
the
best
ever
known
to
the
world
has
enabled
us
to
emerge
from
civil
war
within
four
years
with
a
complete
vindication
of
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
general
government
and
with
our
local
liberties
and
state
institutions
unimpaired
the
throngs
of
emigrants
that
crowd
to
our
shores
are
witnesses
of
the
confidence
of
all
peoples
in
our
permanence
here
is
the
great
land
of
free
labor
where
industry
is
blessed
with
unexampled
rewards
and
the
bread
of
the
workingman
is
sweetened
by
the
consciousness
that
the
cause
of
the
country
is
his
own
cause
his
own
safety
his
own
dignity
here
everyone
enjoys
the
free
use
of
his
faculties
and
the
choice
of
activity
as
a
natural
right
here
under
the
combined
influence
of
a
fruitful
soil
genial
climes
and
happy
institutions
population
has
increased
fifteenfold
within
a
century
here
through
the
easy
development
of
boundless
resources
wealth
has
increased
with
twofold
greater
rapidity
than
numbers
so
that
we
have
become
secure
against
the
financial
vicissitudes
of
other
countries
and
alike
in
business
and
in
opinion
are
selfcentered
and
truly
independent
here
more
and
more
care
is
given
to
provide
education
for
everyone
born
on
our
soil
here
religion
released
from
political
connection
with
the
civil
government
refuses
to
subserve
the
craft
of
statesmen
and
becomes
in
its
independence
the
spiritual
life
of
the
people
here
toleration
is
extended
to
every
opinion
in
the
quiet
certainty
that
truth
needs
only
a
fair
field
to
secure
the
victory
here
the
human
mind
goes
forth
unshackled
in
the
pursuit
of
science
to
collect
stores
of
knowledge
and
acquire
an
everincreasing
mastery
over
the
forces
of
nature
here
the
national
domain
is
offered
and
held
in
millions
of
separate
freeholds
so
that
our
fellowcitizens
beyond
the
occupants
of
any
other
part
of
the
earth
constitute
in
reality
a
people
here
exists
the
democratic
form
of
government
and
that
form
of
government
by
the
confession
of
european
statesmen
gives
a
power
of
which
no
other
form
is
capable
because
it
incorporates
every
man
with
the
state
and
arouses
everything
that
belongs
to
the
soul
where
in
past
history
does
a
parallel
exist
to
the
public
happiness
which
is
within
the
reach
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
where
in
any
part
of
the
globe
can
institutions
be
found
so
suited
to
their
habits
or
so
entitled
to
their
love
as
their
own
free
constitution
every
one
of
them
then
in
whatever
part
of
the
land
he
has
his
home
must
wish
its
perpetuity
who
of
them
will
not
now
acknowledge
in
the
words
of
washington
that
every
step
by
which
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
advanced
to
the
character
of
an
independent
nation
seems
to
have
been
distinguished
by
some
token
of
providential
agency
who
will
not
join
with
me
in
the
prayer
that
the
invisible
hand
which
has
led
us
through
the
clouds
that
gloomed
around
our
path
will
so
guide
us
onward
to
a
perfect
restoration
of
fraternal
affection
that
we
of
this
day
may
be
able
to
transmit
our
great
inheritance
of
state
governments
in
all
their
rights
of
the
general
government
in
its
whole
constitutional
vigor
to
our
posterity
and
they
to
theirs
through
countless
generations

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
throughout
the
year
since
our
last
meeting
the
country
has
been
eminently
prosperous
in
all
its
material
interests
the
general
health
has
been
excellent
our
harvests
have
been
abundant
and
plenty
smiles
throughout
the
laud
our
commerce
and
manufactures
have
been
prosecuted
with
energy
and
industry
and
have
yielded
fair
and
ample
returns
in
short
no
nation
in
the
tide
of
time
has
ever
presented
a
spectacle
of
greater
material
prosperity
than
we
have
done
until
within
a
very
recent
period
why
is
it
then
that
discontent
now
so
extensively
prevails
and
the
union
of
the
states
which
is
the
source
of
all
these
blessings
is
threatened
with
destruction
the
longcontinued
and
intemperate
interference
of
the
northern
people
with
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
southern
states
has
at
length
produced
its
natural
effects
the
different
sections
of
the
union
are
now
arrayed
against
each
other
and
the
time
has
arrived
so
much
dreaded
by
the
father
of
his
country
when
hostile
geographical
parties
have
been
formed
i
have
long
foreseen
and
often
forewarned
my
countrymen
of
the
now
impending
danger
this
does
not
proceed
solely
from
the
claim
on
the
part
of
congress
or
the
territorial
legislatures
to
exclude
slavery
from
the
territories
nor
from
the
efforts
of
different
states
to
defeat
the
execution
of
the
fugitiveslave
law
all
or
any
of
these
evils
might
have
been
endured
by
the
south
without
danger
to
the
union
as
others
have
been
in
the
hope
that
time
and
reflection
might
apply
the
remedy
the
immediate
peril
arises
not
so
much
from
these
causes
as
from
the
fact
that
the
incessant
and
violent
agitation
of
the
slavery
question
throughout
the
north
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
has
at
length
produced
its
malign
influence
on
the
slaves
and
inspired
them
with
vague
notions
of
freedom
hence
a
sense
of
security
no
longer
exists
around
the
family
altar
this
feeling
of
peace
at
home
has
given
place
to
apprehensions
of
servile
insurrections
many
a
matron
throughout
the
south
retires
at
night
in
dread
of
what
may
befall
herself
and
children
before
the
morning
should
this
apprehension
of
domestic
danger
whether
real
or
imaginary
extend
and
intensify
itself
until
it
shall
pervade
the
masses
of
the
southern
people
then
disunion
will
become
inevitable
selfpreservation
is
the
first
law
of
nature
and
has
been
implanted
in
the
heart
of
man
by
his
creator
for
the
wisest
purpose
and
no
political
union
however
fraught
with
blessings
and
benefits
in
all
other
respects
can
long
continue
if
the
necessary
consequence
be
to
render
the
homes
and
the
firesides
of
nearly
half
the
parties
to
it
habitually
and
hopelessly
insecure
sooner
or
later
the
bonds
of
such
a
union
must
be
severed
it
is
my
conviction
that
this
fatal
period
has
not
yet
arrived
and
my
prayer
to
god
is
that
he
would
preserve
the
constitution
and
the
union
throughout
all
generations
but
let
us
take
warning
in
time
and
remove
the
cause
of
danger
it
can
not
be
denied
that
for
five
and
twenty
years
the
agitation
at
the
north
against
slavery
has
been
incessant
in
pictorial
handbills
and
inflammatory
appeals
were
circulated
extensively
throughout
the
south
of
a
character
to
excite
the
passions
of
the
slaves
and
in
the
language
of
general
jackson
to
stimulate
them
to
insurrection
and
produce
all
the
horrors
of
a
servile
war
this
agitation
has
ever
since
been
continued
by
the
public
press
by
the
proceedings
of
state
and
county
conventions
and
by
abolition
sermons
and
lectures
the
time
of
congress
has
been
occupied
in
violent
speeches
on
this
neverending
subject
and
appeals
in
pamphlet
and
other
forms
indorsed
by
distinguished
names
have
been
sent
forth
from
this
central
point
and
spread
broadcast
over
the
union
how
easy
would
it
be
for
the
american
people
to
settle
the
slavery
question
forever
and
to
restore
peace
and
harmony
to
this
distracted
country
they
and
they
alone
can
do
it
all
that
is
necessary
to
accomplish
the
object
and
all
for
which
the
slave
states
have
ever
contended
is
to
be
let
alone
and
permitted
to
manage
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
as
sovereign
states
they
and
they
alone
are
responsible
before
god
and
the
world
for
the
slavery
existing
among
them
for
this
the
people
of
the
north
are
not
more
responsible
and
have
no
more
fight
to
interfere
than
with
similar
institutions
in
russia
or
in
brazil
upon
their
good
sense
and
patriotic
forbearance
i
confess
i
still
greatly
rely
without
their
aid
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
any
president
no
matter
what
may
be
his
own
political
proclivities
to
restore
peace
and
harmony
among
the
states
wisely
limited
and
restrained
as
is
his
power
under
our
constitution
and
laws
he
alone
can
accomplish
but
little
for
good
or
for
evil
on
such
a
momentous
question
and
this
brings
me
to
observe
that
the
election
of
any
one
of
our
fellowcitizens
to
the
office
of
president
does
not
of
itself
afford
just
cause
for
dissolving
the
union
this
is
more
especially
true
if
his
election
has
been
effected
by
a
mere
plurality
and
not
a
majority
of
the
people
and
has
resulted
from
transient
and
temporary
causes
which
may
probably
never
again
occur
in
order
to
justify
a
resort
to
revolutionary
resistance
the
federal
government
must
be
guilty
of
a
deliberate
palpable
and
dangerous
exercise
of
powers
not
granted
by
the
constitution
the
late
presidential
election
however
has
been
held
in
strict
conformity
with
its
express
provisions
how
then
can
the
result
justify
a
revolution
to
destroy
this
very
constitution
reason
justice
a
regard
for
the
constitution
all
require
that
we
shall
wait
for
some
overt
and
dangerous
act
on
the
part
of
the
president
elect
before
resorting
to
such
a
remedy
it
is
said
however
that
the
antecedents
of
the
presidentelect
have
been
sufficient
to
justify
the
fears
of
the
south
that
he
will
attempt
to
invade
their
constitutional
rights
but
are
such
apprehensions
of
contingent
danger
in
the
future
sufficient
to
justify
the
immediate
destruction
of
the
noblest
system
of
government
ever
devised
by
mortals
from
the
very
nature
of
his
office
and
its
high
responsibilities
he
must
necessarily
be
conservative
the
stern
duty
of
administering
the
vast
and
complicated
concerns
of
this
government
affords
in
itself
a
guaranty
that
he
will
not
attempt
any
violation
of
a
clear
constitutional
right
after
all
he
is
no
more
than
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
government
his
province
is
not
to
make
but
to
execute
the
laws
and
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
in
our
history
that
notwithstanding
the
repeated
efforts
of
the
antislavery
party
no
single
act
has
ever
passed
congress
unless
we
may
possibly
except
the
missouri
compromise
impairing
in
the
slightest
degree
the
rights
of
the
south
to
their
property
in
slaves
and
it
may
also
be
observed
judging
from
present
indications
that
no
probability
exists
of
the
passage
of
such
an
act
by
a
majority
of
both
houses
either
in
the
present
or
the
next
congress
surely
under
these
circumstances
we
ought
to
be
restrained
from
present
action
by
the
precept
of
him
who
spake
as
man
never
spoke
that
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
the
day
of
evil
may
never
come
unless
we
shall
rashly
bring
it
upon
ourselves
it
is
alleged
as
one
cause
for
immediate
secession
that
the
southern
states
are
denied
equal
rights
with
the
other
states
in
the
common
territories
but
by
what
authority
are
these
denied
not
by
congress
which
has
never
passed
and
i
believe
never
will
pass
any
act
to
exclude
slavery
from
these
territories
and
certainly
not
by
the
supreme
court
which
has
solemnly
decided
that
slaves
are
property
and
like
all
other
property
their
owners
have
a
right
to
take
them
into
the
common
territories
and
hold
them
there
under
the
protection
of
the
constitution
so
far
then
as
congress
is
concerned
the
objection
is
not
to
anything
they
have
already
done
but
to
what
they
may
do
hereafter
it
will
surely
be
admitted
that
this
apprehension
of
future
danger
is
no
good
reason
for
an
immediate
dissolution
of
the
union
it
is
true
that
the
territorial
legislature
of
kansas
on
the
d
february
passed
in
great
haste
an
act
over
the
veto
of
the
governor
declaring
that
slavery
is
and
shall
be
forever
prohibited
in
this
territory
such
an
act
however
plainly
violating
the
rights
of
property
secured
by
the
constitution
will
surely
be
declared
void
by
the
judiciary
whenever
it
shall
be
presented
in
a
legal
form
only
three
days
after
my
inauguration
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
solemnly
adjudged
that
this
power
did
not
exist
in
a
territorial
legislature
yet
such
has
been
the
factious
temper
of
the
times
that
the
correctness
of
this
decision
has
been
extensively
impugned
before
the
people
and
the
question
has
given
rise
to
angry
political
conflicts
throughout
the
country
those
who
have
appealed
from
this
judgment
of
our
highest
constitutional
tribunal
to
popular
assemblies
would
if
they
could
invest
a
territorial
legislature
with
power
to
annul
the
sacred
rights
of
property
this
power
congress
is
expressly
forbidden
by
the
federal
constitution
to
exercise
every
state
legislature
in
the
union
is
forbidden
by
its
own
constitution
to
exercise
it
it
can
not
be
exercised
in
any
state
except
by
the
people
in
their
highest
sovereign
capacity
when
framing
or
amending
their
state
constitution
in
like
manner
it
can
only
be
exercised
by
the
people
of
a
territory
represented
in
a
convention
of
delegates
for
the
purpose
of
framing
a
constitution
preparatory
to
admission
as
a
state
into
the
union
then
and
not
until
then
are
they
invested
with
power
to
decide
the
question
whether
slavery
shall
or
shall
not
exist
within
their
limits
this
is
an
act
of
sovereign
authority
and
not
of
subordinate
territorial
legislation
were
it
otherwise
then
indeed
would
the
equality
of
the
states
in
the
territories
be
destroyed
and
the
rights
of
property
in
slaves
would
depend
not
upon
the
guaranties
of
the
constitution
but
upon
the
shifting
majorities
of
an
irresponsible
territorial
legislature
such
a
doctrine
f
rom
its
intrinsic
unsoundness
can
not
long
influence
any
considerable
portion
of
our
people
much
less
can
it
afford
a
good
reason
for
a
dissolution
of
the
union
the
most
palpable
violations
of
constitutional
duty
which
have
yet
been
committed
consist
in
the
acts
of
different
state
legislatures
to
defeat
the
execution
of
the
fugitiveslave
law
it
ought
to
be
remembered
however
that
for
these
acts
neither
congress
nor
any
president
can
justly
be
held
responsible
having
been
passed
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
they
are
therefore
null
and
void
all
the
courts
both
state
and
national
before
whom
the
question
has
arisen
have
from
the
beginning
declared
the
fugitiveslave
law
to
be
constitutional
the
single
exception
is
that
of
a
state
court
in
wisconsin
and
this
has
not
only
been
reversed
by
the
proper
appellate
tribunal
but
has
met
with
such
universal
reprobation
that
there
can
be
no
danger
from
it
as
a
precedent
the
validity
of
this
law
has
been
established
over
and
over
again
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
with
perfect
unanimity
it
is
rounded
upon
an
express
provision
of
the
constitution
requiring
that
fugitive
slaves
who
escape
from
service
in
one
state
to
another
shall
be
delivered
up
to
their
masters
without
this
provision
it
is
a
wellknown
historical
fact
that
the
constitution
itself
could
never
have
been
adopted
by
the
convention
in
one
form
or
other
under
the
acts
of
and
both
being
substantially
the
same
the
fugitiveslave
law
has
been
the
law
of
the
land
from
the
days
of
washington
until
the
present
moment
here
then
a
clear
case
is
presented
in
which
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
next
president
as
it
has
been
my
own
to
act
with
vigor
in
executing
this
supreme
law
against
the
conflicting
enactments
of
state
legislatures
should
he
fail
in
the
performance
of
this
high
duty
he
will
then
have
manifested
a
disregard
of
the
constitution
and
laws
to
the
great
injury
of
the
people
of
nearly
onehalf
of
the
states
of
the
union
but
are
we
to
presume
in
advance
that
he
will
thus
violate
his
duty
this
would
be
at
war
with
every
principle
of
justice
and
of
christian
charity
let
us
wait
for
the
overt
act
the
fugitiveslave
law
has
been
carried
into
execution
in
every
contested
case
since
the
commencement
of
the
present
administration
though
often
it
is
to
be
regretted
with
great
loss
and
inconvenience
to
the
master
and
with
considerable
expense
to
the
government
let
us
trust
that
the
state
legislatures
will
repeal
their
unconstitutional
and
obnoxious
enactments
unless
this
shall
be
done
without
unnecessary
delay
it
is
impossible
for
any
human
power
to
save
the
union
the
southern
states
standing
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution
have
right
to
demand
this
act
of
justice
from
the
states
of
the
north
should
it
be
refused
then
the
constitution
to
which
all
the
states
are
parties
will
have
been
willfully
violated
by
one
portion
of
them
in
a
provision
essential
to
the
domestic
security
and
happiness
of
the
remainder
in
that
event
the
injured
states
after
having
first
used
all
peaceful
and
constitutional
means
to
obtain
redress
would
be
justified
in
revolutionary
resistance
to
the
government
of
the
union
i
have
purposely
confined
my
remarks
to
revolutionary
resistance
because
it
has
been
claimed
within
the
last
few
years
that
any
state
whenever
this
shall
be
its
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
may
secede
from
the
union
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
and
without
any
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
other
members
of
the
confederacy
that
as
each
became
parties
to
the
union
by
the
vote
of
its
own
people
assembled
in
convention
so
any
one
of
them
may
retire
from
the
union
in
a
similar
manner
by
the
vote
of
such
a
convention
in
order
to
justify
secession
as
a
constitutional
remedy
it
must
be
on
the
principle
that
the
federal
government
is
a
mere
voluntary
association
of
states
to
be
dissolved
at
pleasure
by
any
one
of
the
contracting
parties
if
this
be
so
the
confederacy
is
a
rope
of
sand
to
be
penetrated
and
dissolved
by
the
first
adverse
wave
of
public
opinion
in
any
of
the
states
in
this
manner
our
thirtythree
states
may
resolve
themselves
into
as
many
petty
jarring
and
hostile
republics
each
one
retiring
from
the
union
without
responsibility
whenever
any
sudden
excitement
might
impel
them
to
such
a
course
by
this
process
a
union
might
be
entirely
broken
into
fragments
in
a
few
weeks
which
cost
our
forefathers
many
years
of
toil
privation
and
blood
to
establish
such
a
principle
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
history
as
well
as
the
character
of
the
federal
constitution
after
it
was
framed
with
the
greatest
deliberation
and
care
it
was
submitted
to
conventions
of
the
people
of
the
several
states
for
ratification
its
provisions
were
discussed
at
length
in
these
bodies
composed
of
the
first
men
of
the
country
its
opponents
contended
that
it
conferred
powers
upon
the
federal
government
dangerous
to
the
rights
of
the
states
whilst
its
advocates
maintained
that
under
a
fair
construction
of
the
instrument
there
was
no
foundation
for
such
apprehensions
in
that
mighty
struggle
between
the
first
intellects
of
this
or
any
other
country
it
never
occurred
to
any
individual
either
among
its
opponents
or
advocates
to
assert
or
even
to
intimate
that
their
efforts
were
all
vain
labor
because
the
moment
that
any
state
felt
herself
aggrieved
she
might
secede
from
the
union
what
a
crushing
argument
would
this
have
proved
against
those
who
dreaded
that
the
rights
of
the
states
would
be
endangered
by
the
constitution
the
truth
is
that
it
was
not
until
many
years
after
the
origin
of
the
federal
government
that
such
a
proposition
was
first
advanced
it
was
then
met
and
refuted
by
the
conclusive
arguments
of
general
jackson
who
in
his
message
of
the
th
of
january
transmitting
the
nullifying
ordinance
of
south
carolina
to
congress
employs
the
following
language
the
right
of
the
people
of
a
single
state
to
absolve
themselves
at
will
and
without
the
consent
of
the
other
states
from
their
most
solemn
obligations
and
hazard
the
liberties
and
happiness
of
the
millions
composing
this
union
can
not
be
acknowledged
such
authority
is
believed
to
be
utterly
repugnant
both
to
the
principles
upon
which
the
general
government
is
constituted
and
to
the
objects
which
it
is
expressly
formed
to
attain
it
is
not
pretended
that
any
clause
in
the
constitution
gives
countenance
to
such
a
theory
it
is
altogether
rounded
upon
inference
not
from
any
language
contained
in
the
instrument
itself
but
from
the
sovereign
character
of
the
several
states
by
which
it
was
ratified
but
is
it
beyond
the
power
of
a
state
like
an
individual
to
yield
a
portion
of
its
sovereign
rights
to
secure
the
remainder
in
the
language
of
mr
madison
who
has
been
called
the
father
of
the
constitution
it
was
formed
by
the
states
that
is
by
the
people
in
each
of
the
states
acting
in
their
highest
sovereign
capacity
and
formed
consequently
by
the
same
authority
which
formed
the
state
constitutions
nor
is
the
government
of
the
united
states
created
by
the
constitution
less
a
government
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
within
the
sphere
of
its
powers
than
the
governments
created
by
the
constitutions
of
the
states
are
within
their
several
spheres
it
is
like
them
organized
into
legislative
executive
and
judiciary
departments
it
operates
like
them
directly
on
persons
and
things
and
like
them
it
has
at
command
a
physical
force
for
executing
the
powers
committed
to
it
it
was
intended
to
be
perpetual
and
not
to
be
annulled
at
the
pleasure
of
any
one
of
the
contracting
parties
the
old
articles
of
confederation
were
entitled
articles
of
confederation
and
perpetual
union
between
the
states
and
by
the
thirteenth
article
it
is
expressly
declared
that
the
articles
of
this
confederation
shall
be
inviolably
observed
by
every
state
and
the
union
shall
be
perpetual
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
having
express
reference
to
the
articles
of
confederation
recites
that
it
was
established
in
order
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
and
yet
it
is
contended
that
this
more
perfect
union
does
not
include
the
essential
attribute
of
perpetuity
but
that
the
union
was
designed
to
be
perpetual
appears
conclusively
from
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution
on
the
federal
government
these
powers
embrace
the
very
highest
attributes
of
national
sovereignty
they
place
both
the
sword
and
the
purse
under
its
control
congress
has
power
to
make
war
and
to
make
peace
to
raise
and
support
armies
and
navies
and
to
conclude
treaties
with
foreign
governments
it
is
invested
with
the
power
to
coin
money
and
to
regulate
the
value
thereof
and
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states
it
is
not
necessary
to
enumerate
the
other
high
powers
which
have
been
conferred
upon
the
federal
government
in
order
to
carry
the
enumerated
powers
into
effect
congress
possesses
the
exclusive
right
to
lay
and
collect
duties
on
imports
and
in
common
with
the
states
to
lay
and
collect
all
other
taxes
but
the
constitution
has
not
only
conferred
these
high
powers
upon
congress
but
it
has
adopted
effectual
means
to
restrain
the
states
from
interfering
with
their
exercise
for
that
purpose
it
has
in
strong
prohibitory
language
expressly
declared
that
no
state
shall
enter
into
any
treaty
alliance
or
confederation
grant
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
coin
money
emit
bills
of
credit
make
anything
but
gold
and
silver
coin
a
tender
in
payment
of
debts
pass
any
bill
of
attainder
ex
post
facto
law
or
law
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts
moreover
no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
the
congress
lay
any
imposts
or
duties
on
imports
or
exports
except
what
may
be
absolutely
necessary
for
executing
its
inspection
laws
and
if
they
exceed
this
amount
the
excess
shall
belong
to
the
united
states
and
no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress
lay
any
duty
of
tonnage
keep
troops
or
ships
of
war
in
time
of
peace
enter
into
any
agreement
or
compact
with
another
state
or
with
a
foreign
power
or

engage
in
war
unless
actually
invaded
or
in
such
imminent
danger
as
will
not
admit
of
delay
in
order
still
further
to
secure
the
uninterrupted
exercise
of
these
high
powers
against
state
interposition
it
is
provided
that
this
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
shall
be
made
in
pursuance
thereof
and
all
treaties
made
or
which
shall
be
made
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
the
judges
in
every
state
shall
be
bound
thereby
anything
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
the
solemn
sanction
of
religion
has
been
superadded
to
the
obligations
of
official
duty
and
all
senators
and
representatives
of
the
united
states
all
members
of
state
legislatures
and
all
executive
and
judicial
officers
both
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
several
states
shall
be
bound
by
oath
or
affirmation
to
support
this
constitution
in
order
to
carry
into
effect
these
powers
the
constitution
has
established
a
perfect
government
in
all
its
formslegislative
executive
and
judicial
and
this
government
to
the
extent
of
its
powers
acts
directly
upon
the
individual
citizens
of
every
state
and
executes
its
own
decrees
by
the
agency
of
its
own
officers
in
this
respect
it
differs
entirely
from
the
government
under
the
old
confederation
which
was
confined
to
making
requisitions
on
the
states
in
their
sovereign
character
this
left
it
in
the
discretion
of
each
whether
to
obey
or
to
refuse
and
they
often
declined
to
comply
with
such
requisitions
it
thus
became
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
removing
this
barrier
and
in
order
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
to
establish
a
government
which
could
act
directly
upon
the
people
and
execute
its
own
laws
without
the
intermediate
agency
of
the
states
this
has
been
accomplished
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
short
the
government
created
by
the
constitution
and
deriving
its
authority
from
the
sovereign
people
of
each
of
the
several
states
has
precisely
the
same
right
to
exercise
its
power
over
the
people
of
all
these
states
in
the
enumerated
cases
that
each
one
of
them
possesses
over
subjects
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
but
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
to
the
extent
of
the
delegated
powers
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
constitution
of
each
state
and
is
as
binding
upon
its
people
as
though
it
had
been
textually
inserted
therein
this
government
therefore
is
a
great
and
powerful
government
invested
with
all
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
over
the
special
subjects
to
which
its
authority
extends
its
framers
never
intended
to
implant
in
its
bosom
the
seeds
of
its
own
destruction
nor
were
they
at
its
creation
guilty
of
the
absurdity
of
providing
for
its
own
dissolution
it
was
not
intended
by
its
framers
to
be
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
which
at
the
touch
of
the
enchanter
would
vanish
into
thin
air
but
a
substantial
and
mighty
fabric
capable
of
resisting
the
slow
decay
of
time
and
of
defying
the
storms
of
ages
indeed
well
may
the
jealous
patriots
of
that
day
have
indulged
fears
that
a
government
of
such
high
powers
might
violate
the
reserved
rights
of
the
states
and
wisely
did
they
adopt
the
rule
of
a
strict
construction
of
these
powers
to
prevent
the
danger
but
they
did
not
fear
nor
had
they
any
reason
to
imagine
that
the
constitution
would
ever
be
so
interpreted
as
to
enable
any
state
by
her
own
act
and
without
the
consent
of
her
sister
states
to
discharge
her
people
from
all
or
any
of
their
federal
obligations
it
may
be
asked
then
are
the
people
of
the
states
without
redress
against
the
tyranny
and
oppression
of
the
federal
government
by
no
means
the
right
of
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
governed
against
the
oppression
of
their
governments
can
not
be
denied
it
exists
independently
of
all
constitutions
and
has
been
exercised
at
all
periods
of
the
worlds
history
under
it
old
governments
have
been
destroyed
and
new
ones
have
taken
their
place
it
is
embodied
in
strong
and
express
language
in
our
own
declaration
of
independence
but
the
distinction
must
ever
be
observed
that
this
is
revolution
against
an
established
government
and
not
a
voluntary
secession
from
it
by
virtue
of
an
inherent
constitutional
right
in
short
let
us
look
the
danger
fairly
in
the
face
secession
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
revolution
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
a
justifiable
revolution
but
still
it
is
revolution
what
in
the
meantime
is
the
responsibility
and
true
position
of
the
executive
he
is
bound
by
solemn
oath
before
god
and
the
country
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
and
from
this
obligation
he
can
not
be
absolved
by
any
human
power
but
what
if
the
performance
of
this
duty
in
whole
or
in
part
has
been
rendered
impracticable
by
events
over
which
he
could
have
exercised
no
control
such
at
the
present
moment
is
the
case
throughout
the
state
of
south
carolina
so
far
as
the
laws
of
the
united
states
to
secure
the
administration
of
justice
by
means
of
the
federal
judiciary
are
concerned
all
the
federal
officers
within
its
limits
through
whose
agency
alone
these
laws
can
be
carried
into
execution
have
already
resigned
we
no
longer
have
a
district
judge
a
district
attorney
or
a
marshal
in
south
carolina
in
fact
the
whole
machinery
of
the
federal
government
necessary
for
the
distribution
of
remedial
justice
among
the
people
has
been
demolished
and
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
replace
it
the
only
acts
of
congress
on
the
statute
book
bearing
upon
this
subject
are
those
of
february
and
march
these
authorize
the
president
after
he
shall
have
ascertained
that
the
marshal
with
his
posse
comitatus
is
unable
to
execute
civil
or
criminal
process
in
any
particular
case
to
call
forth
the
militia
and
employ
the
army
and
navy
to
aid
him
in
performing
this
service
having
first
by
proclamation
commanded
the
insurgents
to
disperse
and
retire
peaceably
to
their
respective
abodes
within
a
limited
time
this
duty
can
not
by
possibility
be
performed
in
a
state
where
no
judicial
authority
exists
to
issue
process
and
where
there
is
no
marshal
to
execute
it
and
where
even
if
there
were
such
an
officer
the
entire
population
would
constitute
one
solid
combination
to
resist
him
the
bare
enumeration
of
these
provisions
proves
how
inadequate
they
are
without
further
legislation
to
overcome
a
united
opposition
in
a
single
state
not
to
speak
of
other
states
who
may
place
themselves
in
a
similar
attitude
congress
alone
has
power
to
decide
whether
the
present
laws
can
or
can
not
be
amended
so
as
to
carry
out
more
effectually
the
objects
of
the
constitution
the
same
insuperable
obstacles
do
not
lie
in
the
way
of
executing
the
laws
for
the
collection
of
the
customs
the
revenue
still
continues
to
be
collected
as
heretofore
at
the
customhouse
in
charleston
and
should
the
collector
unfortunately
resign
a
successor
may
be
appointed
to
perform
this
duty
then
in
regard
to
the
property
of
the
united
states
in
south
carolina
this
has
been
purchased
for
a
fair
equivalent
by
the
consent
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
for
the
erection
of
forts
magazines
arsenals
etc
and
over
these
the
authority
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
has
been
expressly
granted
by
the
constitution
to
congress
it
is
not
believed
that
any
attempt
will
be
made
to
expel
the
united
states
from
this
property
by
force
but
if
in
this
i
should
prove
to
be
mistaken
the
officer
in
command
of
the
forts
has
received
orders
to
act
strictly
on
the
defensive
in
such
a
contingency
the
responsibility
for
consequences
would
rightfully
rest
upon
the
heads
of
the
assailants
apart
from
the
execution
of
the
laws
so
far
as
this
may
be
practicable
the
executive
has
no
authority
to
decide
what
shall
be
the
relations
between
the
federal
government
and
south
carolina
he
has
been
invested
with
no
such
discretion
he
possesses
no
power
to
change
the
relations
heretofore
existing
between
them
much
less
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
that
state
this
would
be
to
invest
a
mere
executive
officer
with
the
power
of
recognizing
the
dissolution
of
the
confederacy
among
our
thirtythree
sovereign
states
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
recognition
of
a
foreign
de
facto
government
involving
no
such
responsibility
any
attempt
to
do
this
would
on
his
part
be
a
naked
act
of
usurpation
it
is
therefore
my
duty
to
submit
to
congress
the
whole
question
in
all
its
beatings
the
course
of
events
is
so
rapidly
hastening
forward
that
the
emergency
may
soon
arise
when
you
may
be
called
upon
to
decide
the
momentous
question
whether
you
possess
the
power
by
force
of
arms
to
compel
a
state
to
remain
in
the
union
i
should
feel
myself
recreant
to
my
duty
were
i
not
to
express
an
opinion
on
this
important
subject
the
question
fairly
stated
is
has
the
constitution
delegated
to
congress
the
power
to
coerce
a
state
into
submission
which
is
attempting
to
withdraw
or
has
actually
withdrawn
from
the
confederacy
if
answered
in
the
affirmative
it
must
be
on
the
principle
that
the
power
has
been
conferred
upon
congress
to
declare
and
to
make
war
against
a
state
after
much
serious
reflection
i
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
no
such
power
has
been
delegated
to
congress
or
to
any
other
department
of
the
federal
government
it
is
manifest
upon
an
inspection
of
the
constitution
that
this
is
not
among
the
specific
and
enumerated
powers
granted
to
congress
and
it
is
equally
apparent
that
its
exercise
is
not
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
execution
any
one
of
these
powers
so
far
from
this
power
having
been
delegated
to
congress
it
was
expressly
refused
by
the
convention
which
framed
the
constitution
it
appears
from
the
proceedings
of
that
body
that
on
the
st
may
the
clause
authorizing
an
exertion
of
the
force
of
the
whole
against
a
delinquent
state
came
up
for
consideration
mr
madison
opposed
it
in
a
brief
but
powerful
speech
from
which
i
shall
extract
but
a
single
sentence
he
observed
the
use
of
force
against
a
state
would
look
more
like
a
declaration
of
war
than
an
infliction
of
pun
ishment
and
would
probably
be
considered
by
the
party
attacked
as
a
dissolution
of
all
previous
compacts
by
which
it
might
be
bound
upon
his
motion
the
clause
was
unanimously
postponed
and
was
never
i
believe
again
presented
soon
afterwards
on
the
th
june
when
incidentally
adverting
to
the
subject
he
said
any
government
for
the
united
states
formed
on
the
supposed
practicability
of
using
force
against
the
unconstitutional
proceedings
of
the
states
would
prove
as
visionary
and
fallacious
as
the
government
of
congress
evidently
meaning
the
then
existing
congress
of
the
old
confederation
without
descending
to
particulars
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
the
power
to
make
war
against
a
state
is
at
variance
with
the
whole
spirit
and
intent
of
the
constitution
suppose
such
a
war
should
result
in
the
conquest
of
a
state
how
are
we
to
govern
it
afterwards
shall
we
hold
it
as
a
province
and
govern
it
by
despotic
power
in
the
nature
of
things
we
could
not
by
physical
force
control
the
will
of
the
people
and
compel
them
to
elect
senators
and
representatives
to
congress
and
to
perform
all
the
other
duties
depending
upon
their
own
volition
and
required
from
the
free
citizens
of
a
free
state
as
a
constituent
member
of
the
confederacy
but
if
we
possessed
this
power
would
it
be
wise
to
exercise
it
under
existing
circumstances
the
object
would
doubtless
be
to
preserve
the
union
war
would
not
only
present
the
most
effectual
means
of
destroying
it
but
would
vanish
all
hope
of
its
peaceable
reconstruction
besides
in
the
fraternal
conflict
a
vast
amount
of
blood
and
treasure
would
be
expended
rendering
future
reconciliation
between
the
states
impossible
in
the
meantime
who
can
foretell
what
would
be
the
sufferings
and
privations
of
the
people
during
its
existence
the
fact
is
that
our
union
rests
upon
public
opinion
and
can
never
be
cemented
by
the
blood
of
its
citizens
shed
in
civil
war
if
it
can
not
live
in
the
affections
of
the
people
it
must
one
day
perish
congress
possesses
many
means
of
preserving
it
by
conciliation
but
the
sword
was
not
placed
in
their
hand
to
preserve
it
by
force
but
may
i
be
permitted
solemnly
to
invoke
my
countrymen
to
pause
and
deliberate
before
they
determine
to
destroy
this
the
grandest
temple
which
has
ever
been
dedicated
to
human
freedom
since
the
world
began
it
has
been
consecrated
by
the
blood
of
our
fathers
by
the
glories
of
the
past
and
by
the
hopes
of
the
future
the
union
has
already
made
us
the
most
prosperous
and
ere
long
will
if
preserved
render
us
the
most
powerful
nation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
in
every
foreign
region
of
the
globe
the
title
of
american
citizen
is
held
in
the
highest
respect
and
when
pronounced
in
a
foreign
land
it
causes
the
hearts
of
our
countrymen
to
swell
with
honest
pride
surely
when
we
reach
the
brink
of
the
yawning
abyss
we
shall
recoil
with
horror
from
the
last
fatal
plunge
by
such
a
dread
catastrophe
the
hopes
of
the
friends
of
freedom
throughout
the
world
would
be
destroyed
and
a
long
night
of
leaden
despotism
would
enshroud
the
nations
our
example
for
more
than
eighty
years
would
not
only
be
lost
but
it
would
be
quoted
as
a
conclusive
proof
that
man
is
unfit
for
selfgovernment
it
is
not
every
wrongnay
it
is
not
every
grievous
wrongwhich
can
justify
a
resort
to
such
a
fearful
alternative
this
ought
to
be
the
last
desperate
remedy
of
a
despairing
people
after
every
other
constitutional
means
of
conciliation
had
been
exhausted
we
should
reflect
that
under
this
free
government
there
is
an
incessant
ebb
and
flow
in
public
opinion
the
slavery
question
like
everything
human
will
have
its
day
i
firmly
believe
that
it
has
reached
and
passed
the
culminating
point
but
if
in
the
midst
of
the
existing
excitement
the
union
shall
perish
the
evil
may
then
become
irreparable
congress
can
contribute
much
to
avert
it
by
proposing
and
recommending
to
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
the
remedy
for
existing
evils
which
the
constitution
has
itself
provided
for
its
own
preservation
this
has
been
tried
at
different
critical
periods
of
our
history
and
always
with
eminent
success
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
fifth
article
providing
for
its
own
amendment
under
this
article
amendments
have
been
proposed
by
twothirds
of
both
houses
of
congress
and
have
been
ratified
by
the
legislatures
of
threefourths
of
the
several
states
and
have
consequently
become
parts
of
the
constitution
to
this
process
the
country
is
indebted
for
the
clause
prohibiting
congress
from
passing
any
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
of
the
right
of
petition
to
this
we
are
also
indebted
for
the
bill
of
rights
which
secures
the
people
against
any
abuse
of
power
by
the
federal
government
such
were
the
apprehensions
justly
entertained
by
the
friends
of
state
rights
at
that
period
as
to
have
rendered
it
extremely
doubtful
whether
the
constitution
could
have
long
survived
without
those
amendments
again
the
constitution
was
amended
by
the
same
process
after
the
election
of
president
jefferson
by
the
house
of
representatives
in
february
this
amendment
was
rendered
necessary
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
the
dangers
which
had
seriously
threatened
the
existence
of
the
government
during
the
pendency
of
that
election
the
article
for
its
own
amendment
was
intended
to
secure
the
amicable
adjustment
of
conflicting
constitutional
questions
like
the
present
which
might
arise
between
the
governments
of
the
states
and
that
of
the
united
states
this
appears
from
contemporaneous
history
in
this
connection
i
shall
merely
call
attention
to
a
few
sentences
in
mr
madisons
justly
celebrated
report
in
to
the
legislature
of
virginia
in
this
he
ably
and
conclusively
defended
the
resolutions
of
the
preceding
legislature
against
the
strictures
of
several
other
state
legislatures
these
were
mainly
rounded
upon
the
protest
of
the
virginia
legislature
against
the
alien
and
sedition
acts
as
palpable
and
alarming
infractions
of
the
constitution
in
pointing
out
the
peaceful
and
constitutional
remediesand
he
referred
to
none
otherto
which
the
states
were
authorized
to
resort
on
such
occasions
he
concludes
by
saying
that
the
legislatures
of
the
states
might
have
made
a
direct
representation
to
congress
with
a
view
to
obtain
a
rescinding
of
the
two
offensive
acts
or
they
might
have
represented
to
their
respective
senators
in
congress
their
wish
that
twothirds
thereof
would
propose
an
explanatory
amendment
to
the
constitution
or
twothirds
of
themselves
if
such
had
been
their
option
might
by
an
application
to
congress
have
obtained
a
convention
for
the
same
object
this
is
the
very
course
which
i
earnestly
recommend
in
order
to
obtain
an
explanatory
amendment
of
the
constitution
on
the
subject
of
slavery
this
might
originate
with
congress
or
the
state
legislatures
as
may
be
deemed
most
advisable
to
attain
the
object
the
explanatory
amendment
might
be
confined
to
the
final
settlement
of
the
true
construction
of
the
constitution
on
three
special
points
an
express
recognition
of
the
right
of
property
in
slaves
in
the
states
where
it
now
exists
or
may
hereafter
exist
the
duty
of
protecting
this
right
in
all
the
common
territories
throughout
their
territorial
existence
and
until
they
shall
be
admitted
as
states
into
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitutions
may
prescribe
a
like
recognition
of
the
right
of
the
master
to
have
his
slave
who
has
escaped
from
one
state
to
another
restored
and
delivered
up
to
him
and
of
the
validity
of
the
fugitiveslave
law
enacted
for
this
purpose
together
with
a
declaration
that
all
state
laws
impairing
or
defeating
this
right
are
violations
of
the
constitution
and
are
consequently
null
and
void
it
may
be
objected
that
this
construction
of
the
constitution
has
already
been
settled
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
what
more
ought
to
be
required
the
answer
is
that
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
still
contest
the
correctness
of
this
decision
and
never
will
cease
from
agitation
and
admit
its
binding
force
until
clearly
established
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
in
their
sovereign
character
such
an
explanatory
amendment
would
it
is
believed
forever
terminate
the
existing
dissensions
and
restore
peace
and
harmony
among
the
states
it
ought
not
to
be
doubted
that
such
an
appeal
to
the
arbitrament
established
by
the
constitution
itself
would
be
received
with
favor
by
all
the
states
of
the
confederacy
in
any
event
it
ought
to
be
tried
in
a
spirit
of
conciliation
before
any
of
these
states
shall
separate
themselves
from
the
union
when
i
entered
upon
the
duties
of
the
presidential
office
the
aspect
neither
of
our
foreign
nor
domestic
affairs
was
at
all
satisfactory
we
were
involved
in
dangerous
complications
with
several
nations
and
two
of
our
territories
were
in
a
state
of
revolution
against
the
government
a
restoration
of
the
african
slave
trade
had
numerous
and
powerful
advocates
unlawful
military
expeditions
were
countenanced
by
many
of
our
citizens
and
were
suffered
in
defiance
of
the
efforts
of
the
government
to
escape
from
our
shores
for
the
purpose
of
making
war
upon
the
offending
people
of
neighboring
republics
with
whom
we
were
at
peace
in
addition
to
these
and
other
difficulties
we
experienced
a
revulsion
in
monetary
affairs
soon
after
my
advent
to
power
of
unexampled
severity
and
of
ruinous
consequences
to
all
the
great
interests
of
the
country
when
we
take
a
retrospect
of
what
was
then
our
condition
and
contrast
this
with
its
material
prosperity
at
the
time
of
the
late
presidential
election
we
have
abundant
reason
to
return
our
grateful
thanks
to
that
merciful
providence
which
has
never
forsaken
us
as
a
nation
in
all
our
past
trials
our
relations
with
great
britain
are
of
the
most
friendly
character
since
the
commencement
of
my
administration
the
two
dangerous
questions
arising
from
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
and
from
the
right
of
search
claimed
by
the
british
government
have
been
amicably
and
honorably
adjusted
th
e
discordant
constructions
of
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
between
the
two
governments
which
at
different
periods
of
the
discussion
bore
a
threatening
aspect
have
resulted
in
a
final
settlement
entirely
satisfactory
to
this
government
in
my
last
annual
message
i
informed
congress
that
the
british
government
had
not
then
completed
treaty
arrangements
with
the
republics
of
honduras
and
nicaragua
in
pursuance
of
the
understanding
between
the
two
governments
it
is
nevertheless
confidently
expected
that
this
good
work
will
ere
long
be
accomplished
this
confident
expectation
has
since
been
fulfilled
her
britannic
majesty
concluded
a
treaty
with
honduras
on
the
th
november
and
with
nicaragua
on
the
th
august
relinquishing
the
mosquito
protectorate
besides
by
the
former
the
bay
islands
are
recognized
as
a
part
of
the
republic
of
honduras
it
may
be
observed
that
the
stipulations
of
these
treaties
conform
in
every
important
particular
to
the
amendments
adopted
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
to
the
treaty
concluded
at
london
on
the
th
october
between
the
two
governments
it
will
be
recollected
that
this
treaty
was
rejected
by
the
british
government
because
of
its
objection
to
the
just
and
important
amendment
of
the
senate
to
the
article
relating
to
ruatan
and
the
other
islands
in
the
bay
of
honduras
it
must
be
a
source
of
sincere
satisfaction
to
all
classes
of
our
fellowcitizens
and
especially
to
those
engaged
in
foreign
commerce
that
the
claim
on
the
part
of
great
britain
forcibly
to
visit
and
search
american
merchant
vessels
on
the
high
seas
in
time
of
peace
has
been
abandoned
this
was
by
far
the
most
dangerous
question
to
the
peace
of
the
two
countries
which
has
existed
since
the
war
of
whilst
it
remained
open
they
might
at
any
moment
have
been
precipitated
into
a
war
this
was
rendered
manifest
by
the
exasperated
state
of
public
feeling
throughout
our
entire
country
produced
by
the
forcible
search
of
american
merchant
vessels
by
british
cruisers
on
the
coast
of
cuba
in
the
spring
of
the
american
people
hailed
with
general
acclaim
the
orders
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
our
naval
force
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
protect
all
vessels
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas
from
search
or
detention
by
the
vessels
of
war
of
any
other
nation
these
orders
might
have
produced
an
immediate
collision
between
the
naval
forces
of
the
two
countries
this
was
most
fortunately
prevented
by
an
appeal
to
the
justice
of
great
britain
and
to
the
law
of
nations
as
expounded
by
her
own
most
eminent
jurists
the
only
question
of
any
importance
which
still
remains
open
is
the
disputed
title
between
the
two
governments
to
the
island
of
san
juan
in
the
vicinity
of
washington
territory
as
this
question
is
still
under
negotiation
it
is
not
deemed
advisable
at
the
present
moment
to
make
any
other
allusion
to
the
subject
the
recent
visit
of
the
prince
of
wales
in
a
private
character
to
the
people
of
this
country
has
proved
to
be
a
most
auspicious
event
in
its
consequences
it
can
not
fail
to
increase
the
kindred
and
kindly
feelings
which
i
trust
may
ever
actuate
the
government
and
people
of
both
countries
in
their
political
and
social
intercourse
with
each
other
with
france
our
ancient
and
powerful
ally
our
relations
continue
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
a
decision
has
recently
been
made
by
a
french
judicial
tribunal
with
the
approbation
of
the
imperial
government
which
can
not
fail
to
foster
the
sentiments
of
mutual
regard
that
have
so
long
existed
between
the
two
countries
under
the
french
law
no
person
can
serve
in
the
armies
of
france
unless
he
be
a
french
citizen
the
law
of
france
recognizing
the
natural
right
of
expatriation
it
follows
as
a
necessary
consequence
that
a
frenchman
by
the
fact
of
having
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
has
changed
his
allegiance
and
has
lost
his
native
character
he
can
not
therefore
be
compelled
to
serve
in
the
french
armies
in
case
he
should
return
to
his
native
country
these
principles
were
announced
in
by
the
french
minister
of
war
and
in
two
late
cases
have
been
confirmed
by
the
french
judiciary
in
these
two
natives
of
france
have
been
discharged
from
the
french
army
because
they
had
become
american
citizens
to
employ
the
language
of
our
present
minister
to
france
who
has
rendered
good
service
on
this
occasion
i
do
not
think
our
french
naturalized
fellowcitizens
will
hereafter
experience
much
annoyance
on
this
subject
i
venture
to
predict
that
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
the
other
continental
powers
will
adopt
the
same
wise
and
just
policy
which
has
done
so
much
honor
to
the
enlightened
government
of
the
emperor
in
any
event
our
government
is
bound
to
protect
the
rights
of
our
naturalized
citizens
everywhere
to
the
same
extent
as
though
they
had
drawn
their
first
breath
in
this
country
we
can
recognize
no
distinction
between
our
native
and
naturalized
citizens
between
the
great
empire
of
russia
and
the
united
states
the
mutual
friendship
and
regard
which
has
so
long
existed
still
continues
to
prevail
and
if
possible
to
increase
indeed
our
relations
with
that
empire
are
all
that
we
could
desire
our
relations
with
spain
are
now
of
a
more
complicated
though
less
dangerous
character
than
they
have
been
for
many
years
our
citizens
have
long
held
and
continue
to
hold
numerous
claims
against
the
spanish
government
these
had
been
ably
urged
for
a
series
of
years
by
our
successive
diplomatic
representatives
at
madrid
but
without
obtaining
redress
the
spanish
government
finally
agreed
to
institute
a
joint
commission
for
the
adjustment
of
these
claims
and
on
the
th
day
of
march
concluded
a
convention
for
this
purpose
with
our
present
minister
at
madrid
under
this
convention
what
have
been
denominated
the
cuban
claims
amounting
to
in
which
more
than
of
our
fellowcitizens
are
interested
were
recognized
and
the
spanish
government
agreed
to
pay
of
this
amount
within
three
months
following
the
exchange
of
ratifications
the
payment
of
the
remaining
was
to
await
the
decision
of
the
commissioners
for
or
against
the
amistad
claim
but
in
any
event
the
balance
was
to
be
paid
to
the
claimants
either
by
spain
or
the
united
states
these
terms
i
have
every
reason
to
know
are
highly
satisfactory
to
the
holders
of
the
cuban
claims
indeed
they
have
made
a
formal
offer
authorizing
the
state
department
to
settle
these
claims
and
to
deduct
the
amount
of
the
amistad
claim
from
the
sums
which
they
are
entitled
to
receive
from
spain
this
offer
of
course
can
not
be
accepted
all
other
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
spain
or
the
subjects
of
the
queen
of
spain
against
the
united
states
including
the
amistad
claim
were
by
this
convention
referred
to
a
board
of
commissioners
in
the
usual
form
neither
the
validity
of
the
amistad
claim
nor
of
any
other
claim
against
either
party
with
the
single
exception
of
the
cuban
claims
was
recognized
by
the
convention
indeed
the
spanish
government
did
not
insist
that
the
validity
of
the
amistad
claim
should
be
thus
recognized
notwithstanding
its
payment
had
been
recommended
to
congress
by
two
of
my
predecessors
as
well
as
by
myself
and
an
appropriation
for
that
purpose
had
passed
the
senate
of
the
united
states
they
were
content
that
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
board
for
examination
and
decision
like
the
other
claims
both
governments
were
bound
respectively
to
pay
the
amounts
awarded
to
the
several
claimants
at
such
times
and
places
as
may
be
fixed
by
and
according
to
the
tenor
of
said
awards
i
transmitted
this
convention
to
the
senate
for
their
constitutional
action
on
the
d
of
may
and
on
the
th
of
the
succeeding
june
they
determined
that
they
would
not
advise
and
consent
to
its
ratification
these
proceedings
place
our
relations
with
spain
in
an
awkward
and
embarrassing
position
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
final
adjustment
of
these
claims
will
devolve
upon
my
successor
i
reiterate
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
annual
message
of
december
and
repeated
in
that
of
december
in
favor
of
the
acquisition
of
cuba
from
spain
by
fair
purchase
i
firmly
believe
that
such
an
acquisition
would
contribute
essentially
to
the
wellbeing
and
prosperity
of
both
countries
in
all
future
time
as
well
as
prove
the
certain
means
of
immediately
abolishing
the
african
slave
trade
throughout
the
world
i
would
not
repeat
this
recommendation
upon
the
present
occasion
if
i
believed
that
the
transfer
of
cuba
to
the
united
states
upon
conditions
highly
favorable
to
spain
could
justly
tarnish
the
national
honor
of
the
proud
and
ancient
spanish
monarchy
surely
no
person
ever
attributed
to
the
first
napoleon
a
disregard
of
the
national
honor
of
france
for
transferring
louisiana
to
the
united
states
for
a
fair
equivalent
both
in
money
and
commercial
advantages
with
the
emperor
of
austria
and
the
remaining
continental
powers
of
europe
including
that
of
the
sultan
our
relations
continue
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
the
friendly
and
peaceful
policy
pursued
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
toward
the
empire
of
china
has
produced
the
most
satisfactory
results
the
treaty
of
tientsin
of
the
th
june
has
been
faithfully
observed
by
the
chinese
authorities
the
convention
of
the
th
november
supplementary
to
this
treaty
for
the
adjustment
and
satisfaction
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
on
china
referred
to
in
my
last
annual
message
has
been
already
carried
into
effect
so
far
as
this
was
practicable
under
this
convention
the
sum
of
taels
equal
to
about
was
stipulated
to
be
paid
in
satisfaction
of
the
claims
of
american
citizens
out
of
the
onefifth
of
the
receipts
for
tonnage
import
and
export
duties
on
american
vessels
at
the
ports
of
canton
shanghai
and
fuchau
and
it
was
agreed
that
this
amount
shall
be
in
full
liquidation
of
all
claims
of
american
citizens
at
the
various
ports
to
this
date
debentures
for
this
amount
to
wit
taels
for
canton
for
shanghai
and
for
fuchau
were
delivered
according
to
the
terms
of
the
convention
by
the
respective
chinese
collectors
of
the
customs
of
these
ports
to
the

agent
selected
by
our
minister
to
receive
the
same
since
that
time
the
claims
of
our
citizens
have
been
adjusted
by
the
board
of
commissioners
appointed
for
that
purpose
under
the
act
of
march
and
their
awards
which
proved
satisfactory
to
the
claimants
have
been
approved
by
our
minister
in
the
aggregate
they
amount
to
the
sum
of
the
claimants
have
already
received
a
large
proportion
of
the
sums
awarded
to
them
out
of
the
fund
provided
and
it
is
confidently
expected
that
the
remainder
will
ere
long
be
entirely
paid
after
the
awards
shall
have
been
satisfied
there
will
remain
a
surplus
of
more
than
at
the
disposition
of
congress
as
this
will
in
equity
belong
to
the
chinese
government
would
not
justice
require
its
appropriation
to
some
benevolent
object
in
which
the
chinese
may
be
specially
interested
our
minister
to
china
in
obedience
to
his
instructions
has
remained
perfectly
neutral
in
the
war
between
great
britain
and
france
and
the
chinese
empire
although
in
conjunction
with
the
russian
minister
he
was
ever
ready
and
willing
had
the
opportunity
offered
to
employ
his
good
offices
in
restoring
peace
between
the
parties
it
is
but
an
act
of
simple
justice
both
to
our
present
minister
and
his
predecessor
to
state
that
they
have
proved
fully
equal
to
the
delicate
trying
and
responsible
positions
in
which
they
have
on
different
occasions
been
placed
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
with
japan
concluded
at
yeddo
on
the
th
july
were
exchanged
at
washington
on
the
d
may
last
and
the
treaty
itself
was
proclaimed
on
the
succeeding
day
there
is
good
reason
to
expect
that
under
its
protection
and
influence
our
trade
and
intercourse
with
that
distant
and
interesting
people
will
rapidly
increase
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
were
exchanged
with
unusual
solemnity
for
this
purpose
the
tycoon
had
accredited
three
of
his
most
distinguished
subjects
as
envoys
extraordinary
and
ministers
plenipotentiary
who
were
received
and
treated
with
marked
distinction
and
kindness
both
by
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
have
returned
to
their
native
land
entirely
satisfied
with
their
visit
and
inspired
by
the
most
friendly
feelings
for
our
country
let
us
ardently
hope
in
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
that
there
shall
henceforward
be
perpetual
peace
and
friendship
between
the
united
states
of
america
and
his
majesty
the
tycoon
of
japan
and
his
successors
with
the
wise
conservative
and
liberal
government
of
the
empire
of
brazil
our
relations
continue
to
be
of
the
most
amicable
character
the
exchange
of
the
ratifications
of
the
convention
with
the
republic
of
new
granada
signed
at
washington
on
the
th
of
september
has
been
long
delayed
from
accidental
causes
for
which
neither
party
is
censurable
these
ratifications
were
duly
exchanged
in
this
city
on
the
th
of
november
last
thus
has
a
controversy
been
amicably
terminated
which
had
become
so
serious
at
the
period
of
my
inauguration
as
to
require
me
on
the
th
of
april
to
direct
our
minister
to
demand
his
passports
and
return
to
the
united
states
under
this
convention
the
government
of
new
granada
has
specially
acknowledged
itself
to
be
responsible
to
our
citizens
for
damages
which
were
caused
by
the
riot
at
panama
on
the
th
april
these
claims
together
with
other
claims
of
our
citizens
which
had
been
long
urged
in
vain
are
referred
for
adjustment
to
a
board
of
commissioners
i
submit
a
copy
of
the
convention
to
congress
and
recommend
the
legislation
necessary
to
carry
it
into
effect
persevering
efforts
have
been
made
for
the
adjustment
of
the
claims
of
american
citizens
against
the
government
of
costa
rica
and
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
these
have
finally
prevailed
a
convention
was
signed
at
the
city
of
san
jose
on
the
d
july
last
between
the
minister
resident
of
the
united
states
in
costa
rica
and
the
plenipotentiaries
of
that
republic
referring
these
claims
to
a
board
of
commissioners
and
providing
for
the
payment
of
their
awards
this
convention
will
be
submitted
immediately
to
the
senate
for
their
constitutional
action
the
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
the
republic
of
nicaragua
have
not
yet
been
provided
for
by
treaty
although
diligent
efforts
for
this
purpose
have
been
made
by
our
minister
resident
to
that
republic
these
are
still
continued
with
a
fair
prospect
of
success
our
relations
with
mexico
remain
in
a
most
unsatisfactory
condition
in
my
last
two
annual
messages
i
discussed
extensively
the
subject
of
these
relations
and
do
not
now
propose
to
repeat
at
length
the
facts
and
arguments
then
presented
they
proved
conclusively
that
our
citizens
residing
in
mexico
and
our
merchants
trading
thereto
had
suffered
a
series
of
wrongs
and
outrages
such
as
we
have
never
patiently
borne
from
any
other
nation
for
these
our
successive
ministers
invoking
the
faith
of
treaties
had
in
the
name
of
their
country
persistently
demanded
redress
and
indemnification
but
without
the
slightest
effect
indeed
so
confident
had
the
mexican
authorities
become
of
our
patient
endurance
that
they
universally
believed
they
might
commit
these
outrages
upon
american
citizens
with
absolute
impunity
thus
wrote
our
minister
in
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
nothing
but
a
manifestation
of
the
power
of
the
government
and
of
its
purpose
to
punish
these
wrongs
will
avail
afterwards
in
came
the
adoption
of
a
new
constitution
for
mexico
the
election
of
a
president
and
congress
under
its
provisions
and
the
inauguration
of
the
president
within
one
short
month
however
this
president
was
expelled
from
the
capital
by
a
rebellion
in
the
army
and
the
supreme
power
of
the
republic
was
assigned
to
general
zuloaga
this
usurper
was
in
his
turn
soon
compelled
to
retire
and
give
place
to
general
miramon
under
the
constitution
which
had
thus
been
adopted
senor
juarez
as
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
became
the
lawful
president
of
the
republic
and
it
was
for
the
maintenance
of
the
constitution
and
his
authority
derived
from
it
that
the
civil
war
commenced
and
still
continues
to
be
prosecuted
throughout
the
year
the
constitutional
party
grew
stronger
and
stronger
in
the
previous
history
of
mexico
a
successful
military
revolution
at
the
capital
had
almost
universally
been
the
signal
for
submission
throughout
the
republic
not
so
on
the
present
occasion
a
majority
of
the
citizens
persistently
sustained
the
constitutional
government
when
this
was
recognized
in
april
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
its
authority
extended
over
a
large
majority
of
the
mexican
states
and
people
including
vera
cruz
and
all
the
other
important
seaports
of
the
republic
from
that
period
our
commerce
with
mexico
began
to
revive
and
the
constitutional
government
has
afforded
it
all
the
protection
in
its
power
meanwhile
the
government
of
miramon
still
held
sway
at
the
capital
and
over
the
surrounding
country
and
continued
its
outrages
against
the
few
american
citizens
who
still
had
the
courage
to
remain
within
its
power
to
cap
the
climax
after
the
battle
of
tacubaya
in
april
general
marquez
ordered
three
citizens
of
the
united
states
two
of
them
physicians
to
be
seized
in
the
hospital
at
that
place
taken
out
and
shot
without
crime
and
without
trial
this
was
done
notwithstanding
our
unfortunate
countrymen
were
at
the
moment
engaged
in
the
holy
cause
of
affording
relief
to
the
soldiers
of
both
parties
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
battle
without
making
any
distinction
between
them
the
time
had
arrived
in
my
opinion
when
this
government
was
bound
to
exert
its
power
to
avenge
and
redress
the
wrongs
of
our
citizens
and
to
afford
them
protection
in
mexico
the
interposing
obstacle
was
that
the
portion
of
the
country
under
the
sway
of
miramon
could
not
be
reached
without
passing
over
territory
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
constitutional
government
under
these
circumstances
i
deemed
it
my
duty
to
recommend
to
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
the
employment
of
a
sufficient
military
force
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
where
the
government
of
miramon
was
to
be
found
with
or
if
need
be
without
the
consent
of
the
juarez
government
though
it
was
not
doubted
that
this
consent
could
be
obtained
never
have
i
had
a
clearer
conviction
on
any
subject
than
of
the
justice
as
well
as
wisdom
of
such
a
policy
no
other
alternative
was
left
except
the
entire
abandonment
of
our
fellowcitizens
who
had
gone
to
mexico
under
the
faith
of
treaties
to
the
systematic
injustice
cruelty
and
oppression
of
miramons
government
besides
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
simple
authority
to
employ
this
force
would
of
itself
have
accomplished
all
our
objects
without
striking
a
single
blow
the
constitutional
government
would
then
ere
this
have
been
established
at
the
city
of
mexico
and
would
have
been
ready
and
willing
to
the
extent
of
its
ability
to
do
us
justice
in
additionand
i
deem
this
a
most
important
considerationeuropean
governments
would
have
been
deprived
of
all
pretext
to
interfere
in
the
territorial
and
domestic
concerns
of
mexico
we
should
thus
have
been
relieved
from
the
obligation
of
resisting
even
by
force
should
this
become
necessary
any
attempt
by
these
governments
to
deprive
our
neighboring
republic
of
portions
of
her
territorya
duty
from
which
we
could
not
shrink
without
abandoning
the
traditional
and
established
policy
of
the
american
people
i
am
happy
to
observe
that
firmly
relying
upon
the
justice
and
good
faith
of
these
governments
there
is
no
present
danger
that
such
a
contingency
will
happen
having
discovered
that
my
recommendations
would
not
be
sustained
by
congress
the
next
alternative
was
to
accomplish
in
some
degree
if
possible
the
same
objects
by
treaty
stipulations
with
the
constitutional
government
such
treaties
were
accordingly
concluded
by
our
late
able
and
excellent
minister
to
mexico
and
on
the
th
of
january
last
were
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
as
these
have
not
yet
received
the
final
action
of
that
body
it
would
be
improper
for
me
to
present
a
detailed
statement
of
their
provisions
still
i
may
be
permi
tted
to
express
the
opinion
in
advance
that
they
are
calculated
to
promote
the
agricultural
manufacturing
and
commercial
interests
of
the
country
and
to
secure
our
just
influence
with
an
adjoining
republic
as
to
whose
fortunes
and
fate
we
can
never
feel
indifferent
whilst
at
the
same
time
they
provide
for
the
payment
of
a
considerable
amount
toward
the
satisfaction
of
the
claims
of
our
injured
fellowcitizens
at
the
period
of
my
inauguration
i
was
confronted
in
kansas
by
a
revolutionary
government
existing
under
what
is
called
the
topeka
constitution
its
avowed
object
was
to
subdue
the
territorial
government
by
force
and
to
inaugurate
what
was
called
the
topeka
government
in
its
stead
to
accomplish
this
object
an
extensive
military
organization
was
formed
and
its
command
intrusted
to
the
most
violent
revolutionary
leaders
under
these
circumstances
it
became
my
imperative
duty
to
exert
the
whole
constitutional
power
of
the
executive
to
prevent
the
flames
of
civil
war
from
again
raging
in
kansas
which
in
the
excited
state
of
the
public
mind
both
north
and
south
might
have
extended
into
the
neighboring
states
the
hostile
parties
in
kansas
had
been
inflamed
against
each
other
by
emissaries
both
from
the
north
and
the
south
to
a
degree
of
malignity
without
parallel
in
our
history
to
prevent
actual
collision
and
to
assist
the
civil
magistrates
in
enforcing
the
laws
a
strong
detachment
of
the
army
was
stationed
in
the
territory
ready
to
aid
the
marshal
and
his
deputies
when
lawfully
called
upon
as
a
posse
comitatus
in
the
execution
of
civil
and
criminal
process
still
the
troubles
in
kansas
could
not
have
been
permanently
settled
without
an
election
by
the
people
the
ballot
box
is
the
surest
arbiter
of
disputes
among
freemen
under
this
conviction
every
proper
effort
was
employed
to
induce
the
hostile
parties
to
vote
at
the
election
of
delegates
to
frame
a
state
constitution
and
afterwards
at
the
election
to
decide
whether
kansas
should
be
a
slave
or
free
state
the
insurgent
party
refused
to
vote
at
either
lest
this
might
be
considered
a
recognition
on
their
part
of
the
territorial
government
established
by
congress
a
better
spirit
however
seemed
soon
after
to
prevail
and
the
two
parties
met
face
to
face
at
the
third
election
held
on
the
first
monday
of
january
for
members
of
the
legislature
and
state
officers
under
the
lecompton
constitution
the
result
was
the
triumph
of
the
antislavery
party
at
the
polls
this
decision
of
the
ballot
box
proved
clearly
that
this
party
were
in
the
majority
and
removed
the
danger
of
civil
war
from
that
time
we
have
heard
little
or
nothing
of
the
topeka
government
and
all
serious
danger
of
revolutionary
troubles
in
kansas
was
then
at
an
end
the
lecompton
constitution
which
had
been
thus
recognized
at
this
state
election
by
the
votes
of
both
political
parties
in
kansas
was
transmitted
to
me
with
the
request
that
i
should
present
it
to
congress
this
i
could
not
have
refused
to
do
without
violating
my
clearest
and
strongest
convictions
of
duty
the
constitution
and
all
the
proceedings
which
preceded
and
followed
its
formation
were
fair
and
regular
on
their
face
i
then
believed
and
experience
has
proved
that
the
interests
of
the
people
of
kansas
would
have
been
best
consulted
by
its
admission
as
a
state
into
the
union
especially
as
the
majority
within
a
brief
period
could
have
amended
the
constitution
according
to
their
will
and
pleasure
if
fraud
existed
in
all
or
any
of
these
proceedings
it
was
not
for
the
president
but
for
congress
to
investigate
and
determine
the
question
of
fraud
and
what
ought
to
be
its
consequences
if
at
the
first
two
elections
the
majority
refused
to
vote
it
can
not
be
pretended
that
this
refusal
to
exercise
the
elective
franchise
could
invalidate
an
election
fairly
held
under
lawful
authority
even
if
they
had
not
subsequently
voted
at
the
third
election
it
is
true
that
the
whole
constitution
had
not
been
submitted
to
the
people
as
i
always
desired
but
the
precedents
are
numerous
of
the
admission
of
states
into
the
union
without
such
submission
it
would
not
comport
with
my
present
purpose
to
review
the
proceedings
of
congress
upon
the
lecompton
constitution
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
their
final
action
has
removed
the
last
vestige
of
serious
revolutionary
troubles
the
desperate
hand
recently
assembled
under
a
notorious
outlaw
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
territory
to
resist
the
execution
of
the
laws
and
to
plunder
peaceful
citizens
will
i
doubt
not
be
speedily
subdued
and
brought
to
justice
had
i
treated
the
lecompton
constitution
as
a
nullity
and
refused
to
transmit
it
to
congress
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
whilst
recalling
the
position
of
the
country
at
that
moment
what
would
have
been
the
disastrous
consequences
both
in
and
out
of
the
territory
from
such
a
dereliction
of
duty
on
the
part
of
the
executive
peace
has
also
been
restored
within
the
territory
of
utah
which
at
the
commencement
of
my
administration
was
in
a
state
of
open
rebellion
this
was
the
more
dangerous
as
the
people
animated
by
a
fanatical
spirit
and
intrenched
within
their
distant
mountain
fastnesses
might
have
made
a
long
and
formidable
resistance
cost
what
it
might
it
was
necessary
to
bring
them
into
subjection
to
the
constitution
and
the
laws
sound
policy
therefore
as
well
as
humanity
required
that
this
object
should
if
possible
be
accomplished
without
the
effusion
of
blood
this
could
only
be
effected
by
sending
a
military
force
into
the
territory
sufficiently
strong
to
convince
the
people
that
resistance
would
be
hopeless
and
at
the
same
time
to
offer
them
a
pardon
for
past
offenses
on
condition
of
immediate
submission
to
the
government
this
policy
was
pursued
with
eminent
success
and
the
only
cause
for
regret
is
the
heavy
expenditure
required
to
march
a
large
detachment
of
the
army
to
that
remote
region
and
to
furnish
it
subsistence
utah
is
now
comparatively
peaceful
and
quiet
and
the
military
force
has
been
withdrawn
except
that
portion
of
it
necessary
to
keep
the
indians
in
check
and
to
protect
the
emigrant
trains
on
their
way
to
our
pacific
possessions
in
my
first
annual
message
i
promised
to
employ
my
best
exertions
in
cooperation
with
congress
to
reduce
the
expenditures
of
the
government
within
the
limits
of
a
wise
and
judicious
economy
an
overflowing
treasury
had
produced
habits
of
prodigality
and
extravagance
which
could
only
be
gradually
corrected
the
work
required
both
time
and
patience
i
applied
myself
diligently
to
this
task
from
the
beginning
and
was
aided
by
the
able
and
energetic
efforts
of
the
heads
of
the
different
executive
departments
the
result
of
our
labors
in
this
good
cause
did
not
appear
in
the
sum
total
of
our
expenditures
for
the
first
two
years
mainly
in
consequence
of
the
extraordinary
expenditure
necessarily
incurred
in
the
utah
expedition
and
the
very
large
amount
of
the
contingent
expenses
of
congress
during
this
period
these
greatly
exceeded
the
pay
and
mileage
of
the
members
for
the
year
ending
june
whilst
the
pay
and
mileage
amounted
to
the
contingent
expenses
rose
to
and
for
the
year
ending
june
whilst
the
pay
and
mileage
amounted
to
the
contingent
expenses
amounted
to
i
am
happy
however
to
be
able
to
inform
you
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
ending
june
the
total
expenditures
of
the
government
in
all
its
brancheslegislative
executive
and
judicialexclusive
of
the
public
debt
were
reduced
to
the
sum
of
this
conclusively
appears
from
the
books
of
the
treasury
in
the
year
ending
june
the
total
expenditure
exclusive
of
the
public
debt
amounted
to
and
that
for
the
year
ending
june
to
whilst
the
books
of
the
treasury
show
an
actual
expenditure
of
for
the
year
ending
june
including
for
the
contingent
expenses
of
congress
there
must
be
deducted
from
this
amount
the
sum
of
with
the
interest
upon
it
of
appropriated
by
the
act
of
february
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
the
deficiency
in
the
revenues
and
defraying
the
expenses
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
year
ending
june
this
sum
therefore
justly
chargeable
to
the
year
must
be
deducted
from
the
sum
of
in
order
to
ascertain
the
expenditure
for
the
year
ending
june
which
leaves
a
balance
for
the
expenditures
of
that
year
of
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
including
treasury
notes
for
the
same
fiscal
year
ending
june
amounted
to
which
added
to
the
above
sum
of
makes
the
aggregate
of
it
ought
in
justice
to
be
observed
that
several
of
the
estimates
from
the
departments
for
the
year
ending
june
were
reduced
by
congress
below
what
was
and
still
is
deemed
compatible
with
the
public
interest
allowing
a
liberal
margin
of
for
this
reduction
and
for
other
causes
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
the
sum
of
or
at
the
most
is
amply
sufficient
to
administer
the
government
and
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
unless
contingent
events
should
hereafter
render
extraordinary
expenditures
necessary
this
result
has
been
attained
in
a
considerable
degree
by
the
care
exercised
by
the
appropriate
departments
in
entering
into
public
contracts
i
have
myself
never
interfered
with
the
award
of
any
such
contract
except
in
a
single
case
with
the
colonization
society
deeming
it
advisable
to
cast
the
whole
responsibility
in
each
case
on
the
proper
head
of
the
department
with
the
general
instruction
that
these
contracts
should
always
be
given
to
the
lowest
and
best
bidder
it
has
ever
been
my
opinion
that
public
contracts
are
not
a
legitimate
source
of
patronage
to
be
conferred
upon
personal
or
political
favorites
but
that
in
all
such
cases
a
public
officer
is
bound
to
act
for
the
government
as
a
prudent
individual
would
act
for
himself
it
is
with
great
satisfaction
i
communicate
the
fact
that
since
the
date
of
my
last
annual
message
not
a
single
slave
has
been
imported
into
the
united
states
in
violation
of
the
laws
prohibiting
the
african
slave
trade
this
statement
is
rounded
upon
a
thorough
examination
and
investigation
of
the
subject
indeed
the
spirit
which
prevailed
some
time
since
among
a
portion
of
our
fellowcitizens
in
favor
o
f
this
trade
seems
to
have
entirely
subsided
i
also
congratulate
you
upon
the
public
sentiment
which
now
exists
against
the
crime
of
setting
on
foot
military
expeditions
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
to
proceed
from
thence
and
make
war
upon
the
people
of
unoffending
states
with
whom
we
are
at
peace
in
this
respect
a
happy
change
has
been
effected
since
the
commencement
of
my
administration
it
surely
ought
to
be
the
prayer
of
every
christian
and
patriot
that
such
expeditions
may
never
again
receive
countenance
in
our
country
or
depart
from
our
shores
it
would
be
a
useless
repetition
to
do
more
than
refer
with
earnest
commendation
to
my
former
recommendations
in
favor
of
the
pacific
railroad
of
the
grant
of
power
to
the
president
to
employ
the
naval
force
in
the
vicinity
for
the
protection
of
the
lives
and
property
of
our
fellowcitizens
passing
in
transit
over
the
different
central
american
routes
against
sudden
and
lawless
outbreaks
and
depredations
and
also
to
protect
american
merchant
vessels
their
crews
and
cargoes
against
violent
and
unlawful
seizure
and
confiscation
in
the
ports
of
mexico
and
the
south
american
republics
when
these
may
be
in
a
disturbed
and
revolutionary
condition
it
is
my
settled
conviction
that
without
such
a
power
we
do
not
afford
that
protection
to
those
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
country
which
they
have
a
right
to
demand
i
again
recommend
to
congress
the
passage
of
a
law
in
pursuance
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
appointing
a
day
certain
previous
to
the
th
march
in
each
year
of
an
odd
number
for
the
election
of
representatives
throughout
all
the
states
a
similar
power
has
already
been
exercised
with
general
approbation
in
the
appointment
of
the
same
day
throughout
the
union
for
holding
the
election
of
electors
for
president
and
vicepresident
of
the
united
states
my
attention
was
earnestly
directed
to
this
subject
from
the
fact
that
the
thirtyfifth
congress
terminated
on
the
d
march
without
making
the
necessary
appropriation
for
the
service
of
the
postoffice
department
i
was
then
forced
to
consider
the
best
remedy
for
this
omission
and
an
immediate
call
of
the
present
congress
was
the
natural
resort
upon
inquiry
however
i
ascertained
that
fifteen
out
of
the
thirtythree
states
composing
the
confederacy
were
without
representatives
and
that
consequently
these
fifteen
states
would
be
disfranchised
by
such
a
call
these
fifteen
states
will
be
in
the
same
condition
on
the
th
march
next
ten
of
them
can
not
elect
representatives
according
to
existing
state
laws
until
different
periods
extending
from
the
beginning
of
august
next
until
the
months
of
october
and
november
in
my
last
message
i
gave
warning
that
in
a
time
of
sudden
and
alarming
danger
the
salvation
of
our
institutions
might
depend
upon
the
power
of
the
president
immediately
to
assemble
a
full
congress
to
meet
the
emergency
it
is
now
quite
evident
that
the
financial
necessities
of
the
government
will
require
a
modification
of
the
tariff
during
your
present
session
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
revenue
in
this
aspect
i
desire
to
reiterate
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
last
two
annual
messages
in
favor
of
imposing
specific
instead
of
ad
valorem
duties
on
all
imported
articles
to
which
these
can
be
properly
applied
from
long
observation
and
experience
i
am
convinced
that
specific
duties
are
necessary
both
to
protect
the
revenue
and
to
secure
to
our
manufacturing
interests
that
amount
of
incidental
encouragement
which
unavoidably
results
from
a
revenue
tariff
as
an
abstract
proposition
it
may
be
admitted
that
ad
valorem
duties
would
in
theory
be
the
most
just
and
equal
but
if
the
experience
of
this
and
of
all
other
commercial
nations
has
demonstrated
that
such
duties
can
not
be
assessed
and
collected
without
great
frauds
upon
the
revenue
then
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
resort
to
specific
duties
indeed
from
the
very
nature
of
an
ad
valorem
duty
this
must
be
the
result
under
it
the
inevitable
consequence
is
that
foreign
goods
will
be
entered
at
less
than
their
true
value
the
treasury
will
therefore
lose
the
duty
on
the
difference
between
their
real
and
fictitious
value
and
to
this
extent
we
are
defrauded
the
temptations
which
ad
valorem
duties
present
to
a
dishonest
importer
are
irresistible
his
object
is
to
pass
his
goods
through
the
customhouse
at
the
very
lowest
valuation
necessary
to
save
them
from
confiscation
in
this
he
too
often
succeeds
in
spite
of
the
vigilance
of
the
revenue
officers
hence
the
resort
to
false
invoices
one
for
the
purchaser
and
another
for
the
customhouse
and
to
other
expedients
to
defraud
the
government
the
honest
importer
produces
his
invoice
to
the
collector
stating
the
actual
price
at
which
he
purchased
the
articles
abroad
not
so
the
dishonest
importer
and
the
agent
of
the
foreign
manufacturer
and
here
it
may
be
observed
that
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
manufactures
imported
from
abroad
are
consigned
for
sale
to
commission
merchants
who
are
mere
agents
employed
by
the
manufacturers
in
such
cases
no
actual
sale
has
been
made
to
fix
their
value
the
foreign
manufacturer
if
he
be
dishonest
prepares
an
invoice
of
the
goods
not
at
their
actual
value
but
at
the
very
lowest
rate
necessary
to
escape
detection
in
this
manner
the
dishonest
importer
and
the
foreign
manufacturer
enjoy
a
decided
advantage
over
the
honest
merchant
they
are
thus
enabled
to
undersell
the
fair
trader
and
drive
him
from
the
market
in
fact
the
operation
of
this
system
has
already
driven
from
the
pursuits
of
honorable
commerce
many
of
that
class
of
regular
and
conscientious
merchants
whose
character
throughout
the
world
is
the
pride
of
our
country
the
remedy
for
these
evils
is
to
be
found
in
specific
duties
so
far
as
this
may
be
practicable
they
dispense
with
any
inquiry
at
the
customhouse
into
the
actual
cost
or
value
of
the
article
and
it
pays
the
precise
amount
of
duty
previously
fixed
by
law
they
present
no
temptations
to
the
appraisers
of
foreign
goods
who
receive
but
small
salaries
and
might
by
undervaluation
in
a
few
cases
render
themselves
independent
besides
specific
duties
best
conform
to
the
requisition
in
the
constitution
that
no
preference
shall
be
given
by
any
regulation
of
commerce
or
revenue
to
the
ports
of
one
state
over
those
of
another
under
our
ad
valorem
system
such
preferences
are
to
some
extent
inevitable
and
complaints
have
often
been
made
that
the
spirit
of
this
provision
has
been
violated
by
a
lower
appraisement
of
the
same
articles
at
one
port
than
at
another
an
impression
strangely
enough
prevails
to
some
extent
that
specific
duties
are
necessarily
protective
duties
nothing
can
be
more
fallacious
great
britain
glories
in
free
trade
and
yet
her
whole
revenue
from
imports
is
at
the
present
moment
collected
under
a
system
of
specific
duties
it
is
a
striking
fact
in
this
connection
that
in
the
commercial
treaty
of
january
between
france
and
england
one
of
the
articles
provides
that
the
ad
valorem
duties
which
it
imposes
shall
be
converted
into
specific
duties
within
six
months
from
its
date
and
these
are
to
be
ascertained
by
making
an
average
of
the
prices
for
six
months
previous
to
that
time
the
reverse
of
the
propositions
would
be
nearer
to
the
truth
because
a
much
larger
amount
of
revenue
would
be
collected
by
merely
converting
the
ad
valorem
duties
of
a
tariff
into
equivalent
specific
duties
to
this
extent
the
revenue
would
be
increased
and
in
the
same
proportion
the
specific
duty
might
be
diminished
specific
duties
would
secure
to
the
american
manufacturer
the
incidental
protection
to
which
he
is
fairly
entitled
under
a
revenue
tariff
and
to
this
surely
no
person
would
object
the
framers
of
the
existing
tariff
have
gone
further
and
in
a
liberal
spirit
have
discriminated
in
favor
of
large
and
useful
branches
of
our
manufactures
not
by
raising
the
rate
of
duty
upon
the
importation
of
similar
articles
from
abroad
but
what
is
the
same
in
effect
by
admitting
articles
free
of
duty
which
enter
into
the
composition
of
their
fabrics
under
the
present
system
it
has
been
often
truly
remarked
that
this
incidental
protection
decreases
when
the
manufacturer
needs
it
most
and
increases
when
he
needs
it
least
and
constitutes
a
sliding
scale
which
always
operates
against
him
the
revenues
of
the
country
are
subject
to
similar
fluctuations
instead
of
approaching
a
steady
standard
as
would
be
the
case
under
a
system
of
specific
duties
they
sink
and
rise
with
the
sinking
and
rising
prices
of
articles
in
foreign
countries
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
congress
to
arrange
a
system
of
specific
duties
which
would
afford
additional
stability
both
to
our
revenue
and
our
manufactures
and
without
injury
or
injustice
to
any
interest
of
the
country
this
might
be
accomplished
by
ascertaining
the
average
value
of
any
given
article
for
a
series
of
years
at
the
place
of
exportation
and
by
simply
converting
the
rate
of
ad
valorem
duty
upon
it
which
might
be
deemed
necessary
for
revenue
purposes
into
the
form
of
a
specific
duty
such
an
arrangement
could
not
injure
the
consumer
if
he
should
pay
a
greater
amount
of
duty
one
year
this
would
be
counterbalanced
by
a
lesser
amount
the
next
and
in
the
end
the
aggregate
would
be
the
same
i
desire
to
call
your
immediate
attention
to
the
present
condition
of
the
treasury
so
ably
and
clearly
presented
by
the
secretary
in
his
report
to
congress
and
to
recommend
that
measures
be
promptly
adopted
to
enable
it
to
discharge
its
pressing
obligations
the
other
recommendations
of
the
report
are
well
worthy
of
your
favorable
consideration
i
herewith
transmit
to
congress
the
reports
of
the
secretaries
of
war
of
the
navy
of
the
interior
and
of
the
postmastergeneral
the
recommendations
and
suggestions
which
they
contain
are
highly
valuable
and
deserve
your
careful
attention
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
details
the
circumstances
under
which
cornelius
vanderbilt
on
my
request
agreed
in
the
month
of
july
last
to
carry
the
ocean
mails
between
our
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
had
he
not
thus

acted
this
important
intercommunication
must
have
been
suspended
at
least
for
a
season
the
postmastergeneral
had
no
power
to
make
him
any
other
compensation
than
the
postages
on
the
mail
matter
which
he
might
carry
it
was
known
at
the
time
that
these
postages
would
fall
far
short
of
an
adequate
compensation
as
well
as
of
the
sum
which
the
same
service
had
previously
cost
the
government
mr
vanderbilt
in
a
commendable
spirit
was
willing
to
rely
upon
the
justice
of
congress
to
make
up
the
deficiency
and
i
therefore
recommend
that
an
appropriation
may
be
granted
for
this
purpose
i
should
do
great
injustice
to
the
attorneygeneral
were
i
to
omit
the
mention
of
his
distinguished
services
in
the
measures
adopted
and
prosecuted
by
him
for
the
defense
of
the
government
against
numerous
and
unfounded
claims
to
land
in
california
purporting
to
have
been
made
by
the
mexican
government
previous
to
the
treaty
of
cession
the
successful
opposition
to
these
claims
has
saved
the
united
states
public
property
worth
many
millions
of
dollars
and
to
individuals
holding
title
under
them
to
at
least
an
equal
amount
it
has
been
represented
to
me
from
sources
which
i
deem
reliable
that
the
inhabitants
in
several
portions
of
kansas
have
been
reduced
nearly
to
a
state
of
starvation
on
account
of
the
almost
total
failure
of
their
crops
whilst
the
harvests
in
every
other
portion
of
the
country
have
been
abundant
the
prospect
before
them
for
the
approaching
winter
is
well
calculated
to
enlist
the
sympathies
of
every
heart
the
destitution
appears
to
be
so
general
that
it
can
not
be
relieved
by
private
contributions
and
they
are
in
such
indigent
circumstances
as
to
be
unable
to
purchase
the
necessaries
of
life
for
themselves
i
refer
the
subject
to
congress
if
any
constitutional
measure
for
their
relief
can
be
devised
i
would
recommend
its
adoption
i
cordially
commend
to
your
favorable
regard
the
interests
of
the
people
of
this
district
they
are
eminently
entitled
to
your
consideration
especially
since
unlike
the
people
of
the
states
they
can
appeal
to
no
government
except
that
of
the
union

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
our
deep
and
heartfelt
gratitude
is
due
to
that
almighty
power
which
has
bestowed
upon
us
such
varied
and
numerous
blessings
throughout
the
past
year
the
general
health
of
the
country
has
been
excellent
our
harvests
have
been
unusually
plentiful
and
prosperity
smiles
throughout
the
land
indeed
notwithstanding
our
demerits
we
have
much
reason
to
believe
from
the
past
events
in
our
history
that
we
have
enjoyed
the
special
protection
of
divine
providence
ever
since
our
origin
as
a
nation
we
have
been
exposed
to
many
threatening
and
alarming
difficulties
in
our
progress
but
on
each
successive
occasion
the
impending
cloud
has
been
dissipated
at
the
moment
it
appeared
ready
to
burst
upon
our
head
and
the
danger
to
our
institutions
has
passed
away
may
we
ever
be
under
the
divine
guidance
and
protection
whilst
it
is
the
duty
of
the
president
from
time
to
time
to
give
to
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
i
shall
not
refer
in
detail
to
the
recent
sad
and
bloody
occurrences
at
harpers
ferry
still
it
is
proper
to
observe
that
these
events
however
bad
and
cruel
in
themselves
derive
their
chief
importance
from
the
apprehension
that
they
are
but
symptoms
of
an
incurable
disease
in
the
public
mind
which
may
break
out
in
still
more
dangerous
outrages
and
terminate
at
last
in
an
open
war
by
the
north
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
south
whilst
for
myself
i
entertain
no
such
apprehension
they
ought
to
afford
a
solemn
warning
to
us
all
to
beware
of
the
approach
of
danger
our
union
is
a
stake
of
such
inestimable
value
as
to
demand
our
constant
and
watchful
vigilance
for
its
preservation
in
this
view
let
me
implore
my
countrymen
north
and
south
to
cultivate
the
ancient
feelings
of
mutual
forbearance
and
good
will
toward
each
other
and
strive
to
allay
the
demon
spirit
of
sectional
hatred
and
strife
now
alive
in
the
land
this
advice
proceeds
from
the
heart
of
an
old
public
functionary
whose
service
commenced
in
the
last
generation
among
the
wise
and
conservative
statesmen
of
that
day
now
nearly
all
passed
away
and
whose
first
and
dearest
earthly
wish
is
to
leave
his
country
tranquil
prosperous
united
and
powerful
we
ought
to
reflect
that
in
this
age
and
especially
in
this
country
there
is
an
incessant
flux
and
reflux
of
public
opinion
questions
which
in
their
day
assumed
a
most
threatening
aspect
have
now
nearly
gone
from
the
memory
of
men
they
are
volcanoes
burnt
out
and
on
the
lava
and
ashes
and
squalid
scoria
of
old
eruptions
grow
the
peaceful
olive
the
cheering
vine
and
the
sustaining
corn
such
in
my
opinion
will
prove
to
be
the
fate
of
the
present
sectional
excitement
should
those
who
wisely
seek
to
apply
the
remedy
continue
always
to
confine
their
efforts
within
the
pale
of
the
constitution
if
this
course
be
pursued
the
existing
agitation
on
the
subject
of
domestic
slavery
like
everything
human
will
have
its
day
and
give
place
to
other
and
less
threatening
controversies
public
opinion
in
this
country
is
allpowerful
and
when
it
reaches
a
dangerous
excess
upon
any
question
the
good
sense
of
the
people
will
furnish
the
corrective
and
bring
it
back
within
safe
limits
still
to
hasten
this
auspicious
result
at
the
present
crisis
we
ought
to
remember
that
every
rational
creature
must
be
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
his
own
teachings
those
who
announce
abstract
doctrines
subversive
of
the
constitution
and
the
union
must
not
be
surprised
should
their
heated
partisans
advance
one
step
further
and
attempt
by
violence
to
carry
these
doctrines
into
practical
effect
in
this
view
of
the
subject
it
ought
never
to
be
forgotten
that
however
great
may
have
been
the
political
advantages
resulting
from
the
union
to
every
portion
of
our
common
country
these
would
all
prove
to
be
as
nothing
should
the
time
ever
arrive
when
they
can
not
be
enjoyed
without
serious
danger
to
the
personal
safety
of
the
people
of
fifteen
members
of
the
confederacy
if
the
peace
of
the
domestic
fireside
throughout
these
states
should
ever
be
invaded
if
the
mothers
of
families
within
this
extensive
region
should
not
be
able
to
retire
to
rest
at
night
without
suffering
dreadful
apprehensions
of
what
may
be
their
own
fate
and
that
of
their
children
before
the
morning
it
would
be
vain
to
recount
to
such
a
people
the
political
benefits
which
result
to
them
from
the
union
selfpreservation
is
the
first
instinct
of
nature
and
therefore
any
state
of
society
in
which
the
sword
is
all
the
time
suspended
over
the
heads
of
the
people
must
at
last
become
intolerable
but
i
indulge
in
no
such
gloomy
forebodings
on
the
contrary
i
firmly
believe
that
the
events
at
harpers
ferry
by
causing
the
people
to
pause
and
reflect
upon
the
possible
peril
to
their
cherished
institutions
will
be
the
means
under
providence
of
allaying
the
existing
excitement
and
preventing
further
outbreaks
of
a
similar
character
they
will
resolve
that
the
constitution
and
the
union
shall
not
be
endangered
by
rash
counsels
knowing
that
should
the
silver
cord
be
loosed
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken
at
the
fountain
human
power
could
never
reunite
the
scattered
and
hostile
fragments
i
cordially
congratulate
you
upon
the
final
settlement
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
of
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
territories
which
had
presented
an
aspect
so
truly
formidable
at
the
commencement
of
my
administration
the
right
has
been
established
of
every
citizen
to
take
his
property
of
any
kind
including
slaves
into
the
common
territories
belonging
equally
to
all
the
states
of
the
confederacy
and
to
have
it
protected
there
under
the
federal
constitution
neither
congress
nor
a
territorial
legislature
nor
any
human
power
has
any
authority
to
annul
or
impair
this
vested
right
the
supreme
judicial
tribunal
of
the
country
which
is
a
coordinate
branch
of
the
government
has
sanctioned
and
affirmed
these
principles
of
constitutional
law
so
manifestly
just
in
themselves
and
so
well
calculated
to
promote
peace
and
harmony
among
the
states
it
is
a
striking
proof
of
the
sense
of
justice
which
is
inherent
in
our
people
that
the
property
in
slaves
has
never
been
disturbed
to
my
knowledge
in
any
of
the
territories
even
throughout
the
late
troubles
in
kansas
there
has
not
been
any
attempt
as
i
am
credibly
informed
to
interfere
in
a
single
instance
with
the
right
of
the
master
had
any
such
attempt
been
made
the
judiciary
would
doubtless
have
afforded
an
adequate
remedy
should
they
fail
to
do
this
hereafter
it
will
then
be
time
enough
to
strengthen
their
hands
by
further
legislation
had
it
been
decided
that
either
congress
or
the
territorial
legislature
possess
the
power
to
annul
or
impair
the
right
to
property
in
slaves
the
evil
would
be
intolerable
in
the
latter
event
there
would
be
a
struggle
for
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
at
each
successive
election
and
the
sacred
rights
of
property
held
under
the
federal
constitution
would
depend
for
the
time
being
on
the
result
the
agitation
would
thus
be
rendered
incessant
whilst
the
territorial
condition
remained
and
its
baneful
influence
would
keep
alive
a
dangerous
excitement
among
the
people
of
the
several
states
thus
has
the
status
of
a
territory
during
the
intermediate
period
from
its
first
settlement
until
it
shall
become
a
state
been
irrevocably
fixed
by
the
final
decision
of
the
supreme
court
fortunate
has
this
been
for
the
prosperity
of
the
territories
as
well
as
the
tranquillity
of
the
states
now
emigrants
from
the
north
and
the
south
the
east
and
the
west
will
meet
in
the
territories
on
a
common
platform
having
brought
with
them
that
species
of
property
best
adapted
in
their
own
opinion
to
promote
their
welfare
from
natural
causes
the
slavery
question
will
in
each
case
soon
virtually
settle
itself
and
before
the
territory
is
prepared
for
admission
as
a
state
into
the
union
this
decision
one
way
or
the
other
will
have
been
a
foregone
conclusion
meanwhile
the
settlement
of
the
new
territory
will
proceed
without
serious
interruption
and
its
progress
and
prosperity
will
not
be
endangered
or
retarded
by
violent
political
struggles
when
in
the
progress
of
events
the
inhabitants
of
any
territory
shall
have
reached
the
number
required
to
form
a
state
they
will
then
proceed
in
a
regular
manner
and
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
of
popular
sovereignty
to
form
a
constitution
preparatory
to
admission
into
the
union
after
this
has
been
done
to
employ
the
language
of
the
kansas
and
nebraska
act
they
shall
be
received
into
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitution
may
prescribe
at
the
time
of
their
admission
this
sound
principle
has
happily
been
recognized
in
some
form
or
other
by
an
almost
unanimous
vote
of
both
houses
of
the
last
congress
all
lawful
means
at
my
command
have
been
employed
and
shall
continue
to
be
employed
to
execute
the
laws
against
the
african
slave
trade
after
a
most
careful
and
rigorous
examination
of
our
coasts
and
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
subject
we
have
not
been
able
to
discover
that
any
slaves
have
been
imported
into
the
united
states
except
the
cargo
by
the
wanderer
numbering
between
three
and
four
hundred
those
engaged
in
this
unlawful
enterprise
have
been
rigorously
prosecuted
but
not
with
as
much
success
as
their
crimes
have
deserved
a
number
of
them
are
still
under
prosecution
our
history
proves
that
the
fathers
of
the
republic
in
advance
of
all
other
nations
condemned
the
african
slave
trade
it
was
notwithstanding
deemed
expedient
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
deprive
congress
of
the
power
to
prohibit
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
any
of
the
states
now
existing
shall
think
proper
to
admit
prior
to
the
year
it
will
be
seen
that
this
restriction
on
the
power
of
congress
was
confined
to
such
states
only
as
might
think
proper
to
admit
the
importation
of
slaves
it
did
not
extend
to
other
states
or
to
the
trade
carried
on
abroad
accordingly
we
find
that
so
early
as
the
d
march
congress
passed
an
act
imposing
severe
penalties
and
punishme
nts
upon
citizens
and
residents
of
the
united
states
who
should
engage
in
this
trade
between
foreign
nations
the
provisions
of
this
act
were
extended
and
enforced
by
the
act
of
th
may
again
the
states
themselves
had
a
clear
right
to
waive
the
constitutional
privilege
intended
for
their
benefit
and
to
prohibit
by
their
own
laws
this
trade
at
any
time
they
thought
proper
previous
to
several
of
them
exercised
this
right
before
that
period
and
among
them
some
containing
the
greatest
number
of
slaves
this
gave
to
congress
the
immediate
power
to
act
in
regard
to
all
such
states
because
they
themselves
had
removed
the
constitutional
barrier
congress
accordingly
passed
an
act
on
th
february
to
prevent
the
importation
of
certain
persons
into
certain
states
where
by
the
laws
thereof
their
admission
is
prohibited
in
this
manner
the
importation
of
african
slaves
into
the
united
states
was
to
a
great
extent
prohibited
some
years
in
advance
of
as
the
year
approached
congress
determined
not
to
suffer
this
trade
to
exist
even
for
a
single
day
after
they
had
the
power
to
abolish
it
on
the
d
of
march
they
passed
an
act
to
take
effect
from
and
after
the
st
day
of
january
prohibiting
the
importation
of
african
slaves
into
the
united
states
this
was
followed
by
subsequent
acts
of
a
similar
character
to
which
i
need
not
specially
refer
such
were
the
principles
and
such
the
practice
of
our
ancestors
more
than
fifty
years
ago
in
regard
to
the
african
slave
trade
it
did
not
occur
to
the
revered
patriots
who
had
been
delegates
to
the
convention
and
afterwards
became
members
of
congress
that
in
passing
these
laws
they
had
violated
the
constitution
which
they
had
framed
with
so
much
care
and
deliberation
they
supposed
that
to
prohibit
congress
in
express
terms
from
exercising
a
specified
power
before
an
appointed
day
necessarily
involved
the
right
to
exercise
this
power
after
that
day
had
arrived
if
this
were
not
the
case
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
expended
much
labor
in
vain
had
they
imagined
that
congress
would
possess
no
power
to
prohibit
the
trade
either
before
or
after
they
would
not
have
taken
so
much
care
to
protect
the
states
against
the
exercise
of
this
power
before
that
period
nay
more
they
would
not
have
attached
such
vast
importance
to
this
provision
as
to
have
excluded
it
from
the
possibility
of
future
repeal
or
amendment
to
which
other
portions
of
the
constitution
were
exposed
it
would
then
have
been
wholly
unnecessary
to
ingraft
on
the
fifth
article
of
the
constitution
prescribing
the
mode
of
its
own
future
amendment
the
proviso
that
no
amendment
which
may
be
made
prior
to
the
year
shall
in
any
manner
affect
the
provision
in
the
constitution
securing
to
the
states
the
right
to
admit
the
importation
of
african
slaves
previous
to
that
period
according
to
the
adverse
construction
the
clause
itself
on
which
so
much
care
and
discussion
had
been
employed
by
the
members
of
the
convention
was
an
absolute
nullity
from
the
beginning
and
all
that
has
since
been
done
under
it
a
mere
usurpation
it
was
well
and
wise
to
confer
this
power
on
congress
because
had
it
been
left
to
the
states
its
efficient
exercise
would
have
been
impossible
in
that
event
any
one
state
could
have
effectually
continued
the
trade
not
only
for
itself
but
for
all
the
other
slave
states
though
never
so
much
against
their
will
and
why
because
african
slaves
when
once
brought
within
the
limits
of
any
one
state
in
accordance
with
its
laws
can
not
practically
be
excluded
from
any
state
where
slavery
exists
and
even
if
all
the
states
had
separately
passed
laws
prohibiting
the
importation
of
slaves
these
laws
would
have
failed
of
effect
for
want
of
a
naval
force
to
capture
the
slavers
and
to
guard
the
coast
such
a
force
no
state
can
employ
in
time
of
peace
without
the
consent
of
congress
these
acts
of
congress
it
is
believed
have
with
very
rare
and
insignificant
exceptions
accomplished
their
purpose
for
a
period
of
more
than
half
a
century
there
has
been
no
perceptible
addition
to
the
number
of
our
domestic
slaves
during
this
period
their
advancement
in
civilization
has
far
surpassed
that
of
any
other
portion
of
the
african
race
the
light
and
the
blessings
of
christianity
have
been
extended
to
them
and
both
their
moral
and
physical
condition
has
been
greatly
improved
reopen
the
trade
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
the
effect
would
be
more
deleterious
on
the
interests
of
the
master
or
on
those
of
the
nativeborn
slave
of
the
evils
to
the
master
the
one
most
to
be
dreaded
would
be
the
introduction
of
wild
heathen
and
ignorant
barbarians
among
the
sober
orderly
and
quiet
slaves
whose
ancestors
have
been
on
the
soil
for
several
generations
this
might
tend
to
barbarize
demoralize
and
exasperate
the
whole
mass
and
produce
most
deplorable
consequences
the
effect
upon
the
existing
slave
would
if
possible
be
still
more
deplorable
at
present
he
is
treated
with
kindness
and
humanity
he
is
well
fed
well
clothed
and
not
overworked
his
condition
is
incomparably
better
than
that
of
the
coolies
which
modern
nations
of
high
civilization
have
employed
as
a
substitute
for
african
slaves
both
the
philanthropy
and
the
selfinterest
of
the
master
have
combined
to
produce
this
humane
result
but
let
this
trade
be
reopened
and
what
will
be
the
effect
the
same
to
a
considerable
extent
as
on
a
neighboring
island
the
only
spot
now
on
earth
where
the
african
slave
trade
is
openly
tolerated
and
this
in
defiance
of
solemn
treaties
with
a
power
abundantly
able
at
any
moment
to
enforce
their
execution
there
the
master
intent
upon
present
gain
extorts
from
the
slave
as
much
labor
as
his
physical
powers
are
capable
of
enduring
knowing
that
when
death
comes
to
his
relief
his
place
can
be
supplied
at
a
price
reduced
to
the
lowest
point
by
the
competition
of
rival
african
slave
traders
should
this
ever
be
the
case
in
our
country
which
i
do
not
deem
possible
the
present
useful
character
of
the
domestic
institution
wherein
those
too
old
and
too
young
to
work
are
provided
for
with
care
and
humanity
and
those
capable
of
labor
are
not
overtasked
would
undergo
an
unfortunate
change
the
feeling
of
reciprocal
dependence
and
attachment
which
now
exists
between
master
and
slave
would
be
converted
into
mutual
distrust
and
hostility
but
we
are
obliged
as
a
christian
and
moral
nation
to
consider
what
would
be
the
effect
upon
unhappy
africa
itself
if
we
should
reopen
the
slave
trade
this
would
give
the
trade
an
impulse
and
extension
which
it
has
never
had
even
in
its
palmiest
days
the
numerous
victims
required
to
supply
it
would
convert
the
whole
slave
coast
into
a
perfect
pandemonium
for
which
this
country
would
be
held
responsible
in
the
eyes
both
of
god
and
man
its
petty
tribes
would
then
be
constantly
engaged
in
predatory
wars
against
each
other
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
slaves
to
supply
the
american
market
all
hopes
of
african
civilization
would
thus
be
ended
on
the
other
hand
when
a
market
for
african
slaves
shall
no
longer
be
furnished
in
cuba
and
thus
all
the
world
be
closed
against
this
trade
we
may
then
indulge
a
reasonable
hope
for
the
gradual
improvement
of
africa
the
chief
motive
of
war
among
the
tribes
will
cease
whenever
there
is
no
longer
any
demand
for
slaves
the
resources
of
that
fertile
but
miserable
country
might
then
be
developed
by
the
hand
of
industry
and
afford
subjects
for
legitimate
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
in
this
manner
christianity
and
civilization
may
gradually
penetrate
the
existing
gloom
the
wisdom
of
the
course
pursued
by
this
government
toward
china
has
been
vindicated
by
the
event
whilst
we
sustained
a
neutral
position
in
the
war
waged
by
great
britain
and
france
against
the
chinese
empire
our
late
minister
in
obedience
to
his
instructions
judiciously
cooperated
with
the
ministers
of
these
powers
in
all
peaceful
measures
to
secure
by
treaty
the
just
concessions
demanded
by
the
interests
of
foreign
commerce
the
result
is
that
satisfactory
treaties
have
been
concluded
with
china
by
the
respective
ministers
of
the
united
states
great
britain
france
and
russia
our
treaty
or
general
convention
of
peace
amity
and
commerce
with
that
empire
was
concluded
at
tientsin
on
the
th
june
and
was
ratified
by
the
president
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
on
the
st
december
following
on
the
th
december
john
e
ward
a
distinguished
citizen
of
georgia
was
duly
commissioned
as
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
china
he
left
the
united
states
for
the
place
of
his
destination
on
the
th
of
february
bearing
with
him
the
ratified
copy
of
this
treaty
and
arrived
at
shanghai
on
the
th
may
from
thence
he
proceeded
to
peking
on
the
th
june
but
did
not
arrive
in
that
city
until
the
th
july
according
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
the
ratifications
were
to
be
exchanged
on
or
before
the
th
june
this
was
rendered
impossible
by
reasons
and
events
beyond
his
control
not
necessary
to
detail
but
still
it
is
due
to
the
chinese
authorities
at
shanghai
to
state
that
they
always
assured
him
no
advantage
should
be
taken
of
the
delay
and
this
pledge
has
been
faithfully
redeemed
on
the
arrival
of
mr
ward
at
peking
he
requested
an
audience
of
the
emperor
to
present
his
letter
of
credence
this
he
did
not
obtain
in
consequence
of
his
very
proper
refusal
to
submit
to
the
humiliating
ceremonies
required
by
the
etiquette
of
this
strange
people
in
approaching
their
sovereign
nevertheless
the
interviews
on
this
question
were
conducted
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
and
with
all
due
regard
to
his
personal
feelings
and
the
honor
of
his
country
when
a
presentation
to
his
majesty
was
found
to
be
impossible
the
letter
of
credence
from
the
president
was
received
with
peculiar
honors
by
kweiliang
the
emperors
prime
minister
and
the
second
man
in
the
empire
to
the
emperor
himself
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
were
afterwards
on
the
th
of
august
exchanged
in
proper
form
at
peitsang
as
the
exchange
did
not
take
place
until
after
the
day
prescribed
by
the
treaty
it
is
deemed
proper
before
i
ts
publication
again
to
submit
it
to
the
senate
it
is
but
simple
justice
to
the
chinese
authorities
to
observe
that
throughout
the
whole
transaction
they
appear
to
have
acted
in
good
faith
and
in
a
friendly
spirit
toward
the
united
states
it
is
true
this
has
been
done
after
their
own
peculiar
fashion
but
we
ought
to
regard
with
a
lenient
eye
the
ancient
customs
of
an
empire
dating
back
for
thousands
of
years
so
far
as
this
may
be
consistent
with
our
own
national
honor
the
conduct
of
our
minister
on
the
occasion
has
received
my
entire
approbation
in
order
to
carry
out
the
spirit
of
this
treaty
and
to
give
it
full
effect
it
became
necessary
to
conclude
two
supplemental
conventions
the
one
for
the
adjustment
and
satisfaction
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
and
the
other
to
fix
the
tariff
on
imports
and
exports
and
to
regulate
the
transit
duties
and
trade
of
our
merchants
with
china
this
duty
was
satisfactorily
performed
by
our
late
minister
these
conventions
bear
date
at
shanghai
on
the
th
november
having
been
considered
in
the
light
of
binding
agreements
subsidiary
to
the
principal
treaty
and
to
be
carried
into
execution
without
delay
they
do
not
provide
for
any
formal
ratification
or
exchange
of
ratifications
by
the
contracting
parties
this
was
not
deemed
necessary
by
the
chinese
who
are
already
proceeding
in
good
faith
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
our
citizens
and
it
is
hoped
to
carry
out
the
other
provisions
of
the
conventions
still
i
thought
it
was
proper
to
submit
them
to
the
senate
by
which
they
were
ratified
on
the
d
of
march
the
ratified
copies
however
did
not
reach
shanghai
until
after
the
departure
of
our
minister
to
peking
and
these
conventions
could
not
therefore
be
exchanged
at
the
same
time
with
the
principal
treaty
no
doubt
is
entertained
that
they
will
be
ratified
and
exchanged
by
the
chinese
government
should
this
be
thought
advisable
but
under
the
circumstances
presented
i
shall
consider
them
binding
engagements
from
their
date
on
both
parties
and
cause
them
to
be
published
as
such
for
the
information
and
guidance
of
our
merchants
trading
with
the
chinese
empire
it
affords
me
much
satisfaction
to
inform
you
that
all
our
difficulties
with
the
republic
of
paraguay
have
been
satisfactorily
adjusted
it
happily
did
not
become
necessary
to
employ
the
force
for
this
purpose
which
congress
had
placed
at
my
command
under
the
joint
resolution
of
d
june
on
the
contrary
the
president
of
that
republic
in
a
friendly
spirit
acceded
promptly
to
the
just
and
reasonable
demands
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
our
commissioner
arrived
at
assumption
the
capital
of
the
republic
on
the
th
of
january
and
left
it
on
the
th
of
february
having
in
three
weeks
ably
and
successfully
accomplished
all
the
objects
of
his
mission
the
treaties
which
he
has
concluded
will
be
immediately
submitted
to
the
senate
in
the
view
that
the
employment
of
other
than
peaceful
means
might
become
necessary
to
obtain
just
satisfaction
from
paraguay
a
strong
naval
force
was
concentrated
in
the
waters
of
the
la
plata
to
await
contingencies
whilst
our
commissioner
ascended
the
rivers
to
assumption
the
navy
department
is
entitled
to
great
credit
for
the
promptness
efficiency
and
economy
with
which
this
expedition
was
fitted
out
and
conducted
it
consisted
of
armed
vessels
great
and
small
carrying
guns
and
men
all
under
the
command
of
the
veteran
and
gallant
shubrick
the
entire
expenses
of
the
expedition
have
been
defrayed
out
of
the
ordinary
appropriations
for
the
naval
service
except
the
sum
of
applied
to
the
purchase
of
seven
of
the
steamers
constituting
a
part
of
it
under
the
authority
of
the
naval
appropriation
act
of
the
d
march
last
it
is
believed
that
these
steamers
are
worth
more
than
their
cost
and
they
are
all
now
usefully
and
actively
employed
in
the
naval
service
the
appearance
of
so
large
a
force
fitted
out
in
such
a
prompt
manner
in
the
fardistant
waters
of
the
la
plata
and
the
admirable
conduct
of
the
officers
and
men
employed
in
it
have
had
a
happy
effect
in
favor
of
our
country
throughout
all
that
remote
portion
of
the
world
our
relations
with
the
great
empires
of
france
and
russia
as
well
as
with
all
other
governments
on
the
continent
of
europe
unless
we
may
except
that
of
spain
happily
continue
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
in
my
last
annual
message
i
presented
a
statement
of
the
unsatisfactory
condition
of
our
relations
with
spain
and
i
regret
to
say
that
this
has
not
materially
improved
without
special
reference
to
other
claims
even
the
cuban
claims
the
payment
of
which
has
been
ably
urged
by
our
ministers
and
in
which
more
than
a
hundred
of
our
citizens
are
directly
interested
remain
unsatisfied
notwithstanding
both
their
justice
and
their
amount
had
been
recognized
and
ascertained
by
the
spanish
government
itself
i
again
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
be
paid
to
the
spanish
government
for
the
purpose
of
distribution
among
the
claimants
in
the
amistad
case
in
common
with
two
of
my
predecessors
i
entertain
no
doubt
that
this
is
required
by
our
treaty
with
spain
of
the
th
october
the
failure
to
discharge
this
obligation
has
been
employed
by
the
cabinet
of
madrid
as
a
reason
against
the
settlement
of
our
claims
i
need
not
repeat
the
arguments
which
i
urged
in
my
last
annual
message
in
favor
of
the
acquisition
of
cuba
by
fair
purchase
my
opinions
on
that
measure
remain
unchanged
i
therefore
again
invite
the
serious
attention
of
congress
to
this
important
subject
without
a
recognition
of
this
policy
on
their
part
it
will
be
almost
impossible
to
institute
negotiations
with
any
reasonable
prospect
of
success
until
a
recent
period
there
was
good
reason
to
believe
that
i
should
be
able
to
announce
to
you
on
the
present
occasion
that
our
difficulties
with
great
britain
arising
out
of
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
had
been
finally
adjusted
in
a
manner
alike
honorable
and
satisfactory
to
both
parties
from
causes
however
which
the
british
government
had
not
anticipated
they
have
not
yet
completed
treaty
arrangements
with
the
republics
of
honduras
and
nicaragua
in
pursuance
of
the
understanding
between
the
two
governments
it
is
nevertheless
confidently
expected
that
this
good
work
will
ere
long
be
accomplished
whilst
indulging
the
hope
that
no
other
subject
remained
which
could
disturb
the
good
understanding
between
the
two
countries
the
question
arising
out
of
the
adverse
claims
of
the
parties
to
the
island
of
san
juan
under
the
oregon
treaty
of
the
th
june
suddenly
assumed
a
threatening
prominence
in
order
to
prevent
unfortunate
collisions
on
that
remote
frontier
the
late
secretary
of
state
on
the
th
july
addressed
a
note
to
mr
crampton
then
british
minister
at
washington
communicating
to
him
a
copy
of
the
instructions
which
he
mr
marcy
had
given
on
the
th
july
to
governor
stevens
of
washington
territory
having
a
special
reference
to
an
apprehended
conflict
between
our
citizens
and
the
british
subjects
on
the
island
of
san
juan
to
prevent
this
the
governor
was
instructed
that
the
officers
of
the
territory
should
abstain
from
all
acts
on
the
disputed
grounds
which
are
calculated
to
provoke
any
conflicts
so
far
as
it
can
be
done
without
implying
the
concession
to
the
authorities
of
great
britain
of
an
exclusive
right
over
the
premises
the
title
ought
to
be
settled
before
either
party
should
attempt
to
exclude
the
other
by
force
or
exercise
complete
and
exclusive
sovereign
rights
within
the
fairly
disputed
limits
in
acknowledging
the
receipt
on
the
next
day
of
mr
marcys
note
the
british
minister
expressed
his
entire
concurrence
in
the
propriety
of
the
course
recommended
to
the
governor
of
washington
territory
by
your
mr
marcys
instructions
to
that
officer
and
stating
that
he
had
lost
no
time
in
transmitting
a
copy
of
that
document
to
the
governorgeneral
of
british
north
america
and
had
earnestly
recommended
to
his
excellency
to
take
such
measures
as
to
him
may
appear
best
calculated
to
secure
on
the
part
of
the
british
local
authorities
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighborhood
of
the
line
in
question
the
exercise
of
the
same
spirit
of
forbearance
which
is
inculcated
by
you
mr
marcy
on
the
authorities
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
thus
matters
remained
upon
the
faith
of
this
arrangement
until
the
th
july
last
when
general
harney
paid
a
visit
to
the
island
he
found
upon
it
twentyfive
american
residents
with
their
families
and
also
an
establishment
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
for
the
purpose
of
raising
sheep
a
short
time
before
his
arrival
one
of
these
residents
had
shot
an
animal
belonging
to
the
company
whilst
trespassing
upon
his
premises
for
which
however
he
offered
to
pay
twice
its
value
but
that
was
refused
soon
after
the
chief
factor
of
the
company
at
victoria
mr
dalles
soninlaw
of
governor
douglas
came
to
the
island
in
the
british
sloop
of
war
satellite
and
threatened
to
take
this
american
mr
cutler
by
force
to
victoria
to
answer
for
the
trespass
he
had
committed
the
american
seized
his
rifle
and
told
mr
dalles
if
any
such
attempt
was
made
he
would
kill
him
upon
the
spot
the
affair
then
ended
under
these
circumstances
the
american
settlers
presented
a
petition
to
the
general
through
the
united
states
inspector
of
customs
mr
hubbs
to
place
a
force
upon
the
island
to
protect
them
from
the
indians
as
well
as
the
oppressive
interference
of
the
authorities
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
at
victoria
with
their
rights
as
american
citizens
the
general
immediately
responded
to
this
petition
and
ordered
captain
george
e
pickett
ninth
infantry
to
establish
his
company
on
bellevue
or
san
juan
island
on
some
suitable
position
near
the
harbor
at
the
southeastern
extremity
this
order
was
promptly
obeyed
and
a
military
post
was
established
at
the
place
designated
the
force
was
afterwards
increased
so
that
by
the
last
return
the
whole
number
of
troops
then
on
the
island
amounted
in
the
aggregate
to
men
whilst
i
do
not
deem
it
proper
on
the
present
occasion
to
go
further
into
the
subject
and
discuss
the
weight
which
ought
to
be
attach
ed
to
the
statements
of
the
british
colonial
authorities
contesting
the
accuracy
of
the
information
on
which
the
gallant
general
acted
it
was
due
to
him
that
i
should
thus
present
his
own
reasons
for
issuing
the
order
to
captain
pickett
from
these
it
is
quite
clear
his
object
was
to
prevent
the
british
authorities
on
vancouvers
island
from
exercising
jurisdiction
over
american
residents
on
the
island
of
san
juan
as
well
as
to
protect
them
against
the
incursions
of
the
indians
much
excitement
prevailed
for
some
time
throughout
that
region
and
serious
danger
of
collision
between
the
parties
was
apprehended
the
british
had
a
large
naval
force
in
the
vicinity
and
it
is
but
an
act
of
simple
justice
to
the
admiral
on
that
station
to
state
that
he
wisely
and
discreetly
forbore
to
commit
any
hostile
act
but
determined
to
refer
the
whole
affair
to
his
government
and
await
their
instructions
this
aspect
of
the
matter
in
my
opinion
demanded
serious
attention
it
would
have
been
a
great
calamity
for
both
nations
had
they
been
precipitated
into
acts
of
hostility
not
on
the
question
of
title
to
the
island
but
merely
concerning
what
should
be
its
condition
during
the
intervening
period
whilst
the
two
governments
might
be
employed
in
settling
the
question
to
which
of
them
it
belongs
for
this
reason
lieutenantgeneral
scott
was
dispatched
on
the
th
of
september
last
to
washington
territory
to
take
immediate
command
of
the
united
states
forces
on
the
pacific
coast
should
he
deem
this
necessary
the
main
object
of
his
mission
was
to
carry
out
the
spirit
of
the
precautionary
arrangement
between
the
late
secretary
of
state
and
the
british
minister
and
thus
to
preserve
the
peace
and
prevent
collision
between
the
british
and
american
authorities
pending
the
negotiations
between
the
two
governments
entertaining
no
doubt
of
the
validity
of
our
title
i
need
scarcely
add
that
in
any
event
american
citizens
were
to
be
placed
on
a
footing
at
least
as
favorable
as
that
of
british
subjects
it
being
understood
that
captain
picketts
company
should
remain
on
the
island
it
is
proper
to
observe
that
considering
the
distance
from
the
scene
of
action
and
in
ignorance
of
what
might
have
transpired
on
the
spot
before
the
generals
arrival
it
was
necessary
to
leave
much
to
his
discretion
and
i
am
happy
to
state
the
event
has
proven
that
this
discretion
could
not
have
been
intrusted
to
more
competent
hands
general
scott
has
recently
returned
from
his
mission
having
successfully
accomplished
its
objects
and
there
is
no
longer
any
good
reason
to
apprehend
a
collision
between
the
forces
of
the
two
countries
during
the
pendency
of
the
existing
negotiations
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
there
has
been
no
improvement
in
the
affairs
of
mexico
since
my
last
annual
message
and
i
am
again
obliged
to
ask
the
earnest
attention
of
congress
to
the
unhappy
condition
of
that
republic
the
constituent
congress
of
mexico
which
adjourned
on
the
th
february
adopted
a
constitution
and
provided
for
a
popular
election
this
took
place
in
the
following
july
and
general
comonfort
was
chosen
president
almost
without
opposition
at
the
same
election
a
new
congress
was
chosen
whose
first
session
commenced
on
the
th
of
september
by
the
constitution
of
the
presidential
term
was
to
begin
on
the
st
of
december
and
continue
for
four
years
on
that
day
general
comonfort
appeared
before
the
assembled
congress
in
the
city
of
mexico
took
the
oath
to
support
the
new
constitution
and
was
duly
inaugurated
as
president
within
a
month
afterwards
he
had
been
driven
from
the
capital
and
a
military
rebellion
had
assigned
the
supreme
power
of
the
republic
to
general
zuloaga
the
constitution
provided
that
in
the
absence
of
the
president
his
office
should
devolve
upon
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
general
comonfort
having
left
the
country
this
functionary
general
juarez
proceeded
to
form
at
guanajuato
a
constitutional
government
before
this
was
officially
known
however
at
the
capital
the
government
of
zuloaga
had
been
recognized
by
the
entire
diplomatic
corps
including
the
minister
of
the
united
states
as
the
de
facto
government
of
mexico
the
constitutional
president
nevertheless
maintained
his
position
with
firmness
and
was
soon
established
with
his
cabinet
at
vera
cruz
meanwhile
the
government
of
zuloaga
was
earnestly
resisted
in
many
parts
of
the
republic
and
even
in
the
capital
a
portion
of
the
army
having
pronounced
against
it
its
functions
were
declared
terminated
and
an
assembly
of
citizens
was
invited
for
the
choice
of
a
new
president
this
assembly
elected
general
miramort
but
that
officer
repudiated
the
plan
under
which
he
was
chosen
and
zuloaga
was
thus
restored
to
his
previous
position
he
assumed
it
however
only
to
withdraw
from
it
and
miramon
having
become
by
his
appointment
president
substitute
continues
with
that
title
at
the
head
of
the
insurgent
party
in
my
last
annual
message
i
communicated
to
congress
the
circumstances
under
which
the
late
minister
of
the
united
states
suspended
his
official
relations
with
the
central
government
and
withdrew
from
the
country
it
was
impossible
to
maintain
friendly
intercourse
with
a
government
like
that
at
the
capital
under
whose
usurped
authority
wrongs
were
constantly
committed
but
never
redressed
had
this
been
an
established
government
with
its
power
extending
by
the
consent
of
the
people
over
the
whole
of
mexico
a
resort
to
hostilities
against
it
would
have
been
quite
justifiable
and
indeed
necessary
but
the
country
was
a
prey
to
civil
war
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
success
of
the
constitutional
president
might
lead
to
a
condition
of
things
less
injurious
to
the
united
states
this
success
became
so
probable
that
in
january
last
i
employed
a
reliable
agent
to
visit
mexico
and
report
to
me
the
actual
condition
and
prospects
of
the
contending
parties
in
consequence
of
his
report
and
from
information
which
reached
me
from
other
sources
favorable
to
the
prospects
of
the
constitutional
cause
i
felt
justified
in
appointing
a
new
minister
to
mexico
who
might
embrace
the
earliest
suitable
opportunity
of
restoring
our
diplomatic
relations
with
that
republic
for
this
purpose
a
distinguished
citizen
of
maryland
was
selected
who
proceeded
on
his
mission
on
the
th
of
march
last
with
discretionary
authority
to
recognize
the
government
of
president
juarez
if
on
his
arrival
in
mexico
he
should
find
it
entitled
to
such
recognition
according
to
the
established
practice
of
the
united
states
on
the
th
of
april
following
mr
mclane
presented
his
credentials
to
president
juarez
having
no
hesitation
in
pronouncing
the
government
of
juarez
to
be
the
only
existing
government
of
the
republic
he
was
cordially
received
by
the
authorities
at
vera
cruz
and
they
have
ever
since
manifested
the
most
friendly
disposition
toward
the
united
states
unhappily
however
the
constitutional
government
has
not
been
able
to
establish
its
power
over
the
whole
republic
it
is
supported
by
a
large
majority
of
the
people
and
the
states
but
there
are
important
parts
of
the
country
where
it
can
enforce
no
obedience
general
miramon
maintains
himself
at
the
capital
and
in
some
of
the
distant
provinces
there
are
military
governors
who
pay
little
respect
to
the
decrees
of
either
government
in
the
meantime
the
excesses
which
always
attend
upon
civil
war
especially
in
mexico
are
constantly
recurring
outrages
of
the
worst
description
are
committed
both
upon
persons
and
property
there
is
scarcely
any
form
of
injury
which
has
not
been
suffered
by
our
citizens
in
mexico
during
the
last
few
years
we
have
been
nominally
at
peace
with
that
republic
but
so
far
as
the
interests
of
our
commerce
or
of
our
citizens
who
have
visited
the
country
as
merchants
shipmasters
or
in
other
capacities
are
concerned
we
might
as
well
have
been
at
war
life
has
been
insecure
property
unprotected
and
trade
impossible
except
at
a
risk
of
loss
which
prudent
men
can
not
be
expected
to
incur
important
contracts
involving
large
expenditures
entered
into
by
the
central
government
have
been
set
at
defiance
by
the
local
governments
peaceful
american
residents
occupying
their
rightful
possessions
have
been
suddenly
expelled
the
country
in
defiance
of
treaties
and
by
the
mere
force
of
arbitrary
power
even
the
course
of
justice
has
not
been
safe
from
control
and
a
recent
decree
of
miramort
permits
the
intervention
of
government
in
all
suits
where
either
party
is
a
foreigner
vessels
of
the
united
states
have
been
seized
without
law
and
a
consular
officer
who

been

and

for
disrespect
to

military
contributions
have
been
levied
in
violation
of
every
principle
of
right
and
the
american
who
resisted

has
had
his

forcibly
taken
away
and
has

banished

of

which
have

large
numbers
of

citizens
have
been
arrested
and
imprisoned
without
any
form
of
examination
or
any
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
even
when
released
have
only
obtained
their

after
much

and
injury
and
without
any
hope
of
redress
the
wholesale
massacre
of
crabbe
and
his
associates
without
trial
in
sonora
as
well
as
the
seizure
and
murder
of
four
sick
americans
who
had
taken
shelter
in
the
house
of
an
american
upon
the
soil
of
the
united
states
was
communicated
to
congress
at
its
last
session
murders
of
a
still
more
atrocious
character
have
been
committed
in
the
very
heart
of
mexico
under
the
authority
of
miramons
government
during
the
present
year
some
of
these
were
only
worthy
of
a
barbarous
age
and
if
they
had
not
been
dearly
proven
would
have
seemed
impossible
in
a
country
which
claims
to
be
civilized
of
this
description
was
the
brutal
massacre
in
april
last
by
order
of
general
marquez
of
three
american
physicians
who
were
seized
in
the
hospital
at
tacubaya
while
attending
upon
the
sick
and
the
dying
of
both
parties
an
d
without
trial
as
without
crime
were
hurried
away
to
speedy
execution
little
less
shocking
was
the
recent
fate
of
ormond
chase
who
was
shot
in
tepic
on
the
th
of
august
by
order
of
the
same
mexican
general
not
only
without
a
trial
but
without
any
conjecture
by
his
friends
of
the
cause
of
his
arrest
he
is
represented
as
a
young
man
of
good
character
and
intelligence
who
had
made
numerous
friends
in
tepic
by
the
courage
and
humanity
which
he
had
displayed
on
several
trying
occasions
and
his
death
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
shocking
to
the
whole
community
other
outrages
might
be
enumerated
but
these
are
sufficient
to
illustrate
the
wretched
state
of
the
country
and
the
unprotected
condition
of
the
persons
and
property
of
our
citizens
in
mexico
in
all
these
cases
our
ministers
have
been
constant
and
faithful
in
their
demands
for
redress
but
both
they
and
this
government
which
they
have
successively
represented
have
been
wholly
powerless
to
make
their
demands
effective
their
testimony
in
this
respect
and
in
reference
to
the
only
remedy
which
in
their
judgments
would
meet
the
exigency
has
been
both
uniform
and
emphatic
nothing
but
a
manifestation
of
the
power
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
wrote
our
late
minister
in
and
of
its
purpose
to
punish
these
wrongs
will
avail
i
assure
you
that
the
universal
belief
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
apprehended
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
that
local
mexican
officials
can
commit
these
outrages
upon
american
citizens
with
absolute
impunity
i
hope
the
president
wrote
our
present
minister
in
august
last
will
feel
authorized
to
ask
from
congress
the
power
to
enter
mexico
with
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states
at
the
call
of
the
constitutional
authorities
in
order
to
protect
the
citizens
and
the
treaty
rights
of
the
united
states
unless
such
a
power
is
conferred
upon
him
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
will
be
respected
in
the
existing
state
of
anarchy
and
disorder
and
the
outrages
already
perpetrated
will
never
be
chastised
and
as
i
assured
you
in
my
no
all
these
evils
must
increase
until
every
vestige
of
order
and
government
disappears
from
the
country
i
have
been
reluctantly
led
to
the
same
opinion
and
in
justice
to
my
countrymen
who
have
suffered
wrongs
from
mexico
and
who
may
still
suffer
them
i
feel
bound
to
announce
this
conclusion
to
congress
the
case
presented
however
is
not
merely
a
case
of
individual
claims
although
our
just
claims
against
mexico
have
reached
a
very
large
amount
nor
is
it
merely
the
case
of
protection
to
the
lives
and
property
of
the
few
americans
who
may
still
remain
in
mexico
although
the
life
and
property
of
every
american
citizen
ought
to
be
sacredly
protected
in
every
quarter
of
the
world
but
it
is
a
question
which
relates
to
the
future
as
well
as
to
the
present
and
the
past
and
which
involves
indirectly
at
least
the
whole
subject
of
our
duty
to
mexico
as
a
neighboring
state
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
united
states
in
that
country
to
redress
the
wrongs
and
protect
the
rights
of
our
own
citizens
is
none
the
less
to
be
desired
because
efficient
and
necessary
aid
may
thus
be
rendered
at
the
same
time
to
restore
peace
and
order
to
mexico
itself
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
result
the
people
of
the
united
states
must
necessarily
feel
a
deep
and
earnest
interest
mexico
ought
to
be
a
rich
and
prosperous
and
powerful
republic
she
possesses
an
extensive
territory
a
fertile
soil
and
an
incalculable
store
of
mineral
wealth
she
occupies
an
important
position
between
the
gulf
and
the
ocean
for
transit
routes
and
for
commerce
is
it
possible
that
such
a
country
as
this
can
be
given
up
to
anarchy
and
ruin
without
an
effort
from
any
quarter
for
its
rescue
and
its
safety
will
the
commercial
nations
of
the
world
which
have
so
many
interests
connected
with
it
remain
wholly
indifferent
to
such
a
result
can
the
united
states
especially
which
ought
to
share
most
largely
in
its
commercial
intercourse
allow
their
immediate
neighbor
thus
to
destroy
itself
and
injure
them
yet
without
support
from
some
quarter
it
is
impossible
to
perceive
how
mexico
can
resume
her
position
among
nations
and
enter
upon
a
career
which
promises
any
good
results
the
aid
which
she
requires
and
which
the
interests
of
all
commercial
countries
require
that
she
should
have
it
belongs
to
this
government
to
render
not
only
by
virtue
of
our
neighborhood
to
mexico
along
whose
territory
we
have
a
continuous
frontier
of
nearly
a
thousand
miles
but
by
virtue
also
of
our
established
policy
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
intervention
of
any
european
power
in
the
domestic
concerns
of
that
republic
the
wrongs
which
we
have
suffered
from
mexico
are
before
the
world
and
must
deeply
impress
every
american
citizen
a
government
which
is
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
redress
such
wrongs
is
derelict
to
its
highest
duties
the
difficulty
consists
in
selecting
and
enforcing
the
remedy
we
may
in
vain
apply
to
the
constitutional
government
at
vera
cruz
although
it
is
well
disposed
to
do
us
justice
for
adequate
redress
whilst
its
authority
is
acknowledged
in
all
the
important
ports
and
throughout
the
seacoasts
of
the
republic
its
power
does
not
extend
to
the
city
of
mexico
and
the
states
in
its
vicinity
where
nearly
all
the
recent
outrages
have
been
committed
on
american
citizens
we
must
penetrate
into
the
interior
before
we
can
reach
the
offenders
and
this
can
only
be
done
by
passing
through
the
territory
in
the
occupation
of
the
constitutional
government
the
most
acceptable
and
least
difficult
mode
of
accomplishing
the
object
will
be
to
act
in
concert
with
that
government
their
consent
and
their
aid
might
i
believe
be
obtained
but
if
not
our
obligation
to
protect
our
own
citizens
in
their
just
rights
secured
by
treaty
would
not
be
the
less
imperative
for
these
reasons
i
recommend
to
congress
to
pass
a
law
authorizing
the
president
under
such
conditions
as
they
may
deem
expedient
to
employ
a
sufficient
military
force
to
enter
mexico
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
indemnity
for
the
past
and
security
for
the
future
i
purposely
refrain
from
any
suggestion
as
to
whether
this
force
shall
consist
of
regular
troops
or
volunteers
or
both
this
question
may
be
most
appropriately
left
to
the
decision
of
congress
i
would
merely
observe
that
should
volunteers
be
selected
such
a
force
could
be
easily
raised
in
this
country
among
those
who
sympathize
with
the
sufferings
of
our
unfortunate
fellowcitizens
in
mexico
and
with
the
unhappy
condition
of
that
republic
such
an
accession
to
the
forces
of
the
constitutional
government
would
enable
it
soon
to
reach
the
city
of
mexico
and
extend
its
power
over
the
whole
republic
in
that
event
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
just
claims
of
our
citizens
would
be
satisfied
and
adequate
redress
obtained
for
the
injuries
inflicted
upon
them
the
constitutional
government
have
ever
evinced
a
strong
desire
to
do
justice
and
this
might
be
secured
in
advance
by
a
preliminary
treaty
it
may
be
said
that
these
measures
will
at
least
indirectly
be
inconsistent
with
our
wise
and
settled
policy
not
to
interfere
in
the
domestic
concerns
of
foreign
nations
but
does
not
the
present
case
fairly
constitute
an
exception
an
adjoining
republic
is
in
a
state
of
anarchy
and
confusion
from
which
she
has
proved
wholly
unable
to
extricate
herself
she
is
entirely
destitute
of
the
power
to
maintain
peace
upon
her
borders
or
to
prevent
the
incursions
of
banditti
into
our
territory
in
her
fate
and
in
her
fortune
in
her
power
to
establish
and
maintain
a
settled
government
we
have
a
far
deeper
interest
socially
commercially
and
politically
than
any
other
nation
she
is
now
a
wreck
upon
the
ocean
drifting
about
as
she
is
impelled
by
different
factions
as
a
good
neighbor
shall
we
not
extend
to
her
a
helping
hand
to
save
her
if
we
do
not
it
would
not
be
surprising
should
some
other
nation
undertake
the
task
and
thus
force
us
to
interfere
at
last
under
circumstances
of
increased
difficulty
for
the
maintenance
of
our
established
policy
i
repeat
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
that
authority
may
be
given
to
the
president
to
establish
one
or
more
temporary
military
posts
across
the
mexican
line
in
sonora
and
chihuahua
where
these
may
be
necessary
to
protect
the
lives
and
property
of
american
and
mexican
citizens
against
the
incursions
and
depredations
of
the
indians
as
well
as
of
lawless
rovers
on
that
remote
region
the
establishment
of
one
such
post
at
a
point
called
arispe
in
sonora
in
a
country
now
almost
depopulated
by
the
hostile
inroads
of
the
indians
from
our
side
of
the
line
would
it
is
believed
have
prevented
much
injury
and
many
cruelties
during
the
past
season
a
state
of
lawlessness
and
violence
prevails
on
that
distant
frontier
life
and
property
are
there
wholly
insecure
the
population
of
arizona
now
numbering
more
than
souls
are
practically
destitute
of
government
of
laws
or
of
any
regular
administration
of
justice
murder
rapine
and
other
crimes
are
committed
with
impunity
i
therefore
again
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
necessity
for
establishing
a
territorial
government
over
arizona
the
treaty
with
nicaragua
of
the
th
of
february
to
which
i
referred
in
my
last
annual
message
failed
to
receive
the
ratification
of
the
government
of
that
republic
for
reasons
which
i
need
not
enumerate
a
similar
treaty
has
been
since
concluded
between
the
parties
bearing
date
on
the
th
march
which
has
already
been
ratified
by
the
nicaraguan
congress
this
will
be
immediately
submitted
to
the
senate
for
their
ratification
its
provisions
can
not
i
think
fail
to
be
acceptable
to
the
people
of
both
countries
our
claims
against
the
governments
of
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
remain
unredressed
though
they
are
pressed
in
an
earnest
manner
and
not
without
hope
of
success
i
deem
it
to
be
my
duty
once
more
earnestly
to
recommend
to
congress
the
passage
of
a
law
authorizing
the
president
to
employ
the
naval
force
at
his
command
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
lives
and
property
of
america
n
citizens
passing
in
transit
across
the
panama
nicaragua
and
tehuantepec
routes
against
sudden
and
lawless
outbreaks
and
depredations
i
shall
not
repeat
the
arguments
employed
in
former
messages
in
support
of
this
measure
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
lives
of
many
of
our
people
and
the
security
of
vast
amounts
of
treasure
passing
and
repassing
over
one
or
more
of
these
routes
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
may
be
deeply
involved
in
the
action
of
congress
on
this
subject
i
would
also
again
recommend
to
congress
that
authority
be
given
to
the
president
to
employ
the
naval
force
to
protect
american
merchant
vessels
their
crews
and
cargoes
against
violent
and
lawless
seizure
and
confiscation
in
the
ports
of
mexico
and
the
spanish
american
states
when
these
countries
may
be
in
a
disturbed
and
revolutionary
condition
the
mere
knowledge
that
such
an
authority
had
been
conferred
as
i
have
already
stated
would
of
itself
in
a
great
degree
prevent
the
evil
neither
would
this
require
any
additional
appropriation
for
the
naval
service
the
chief
objection
urged
against
the
grant
of
this
authority
is
that
congress
by
conferring
it
would
violate
the
constitution
that
it
would
be
a
transfer
of
the
warmaking
or
strictly
speaking
the
wardeclaring
power
to
the
executive
if
this
were
well
rounded
it
would
of
course
be
conclusive
a
very
brief
examination
however
will
place
this
objection
at
rest
congress
possess
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
under
the
constitution
to
declare
war
they
alone
can
raise
and
support
armies
and
provide
and
maintain
a
navy
but
after
congress
shall
have
declared
war
and
provided
the
force
necessary
to
carry
it
on
the
president
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army
and
navy
can
alone
employ
this
force
in
making
war
against
the
enemy
this
is
the
plain
language
and
history
proves
that
it
was
the
wellknown
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
it
will
not
be
denied
that
the
general
power
to
declare
war
is
without
limitation
and
embraces
within
itself
not
only
what
writers
on
the
law
of
nations
term
a
public
or
perfect
war
but
also
an
imperfect
war
and
in
short
every
species
of
hostility
however
confined
or
limited
without
the
authority
of
congress
the
president
can
not
fire
a
hostile
gun
in
any
case
except
to
repel
the
attacks
of
an
enemy
it
will
not
be
doubted
that
under
this
power
congress
could
if
they
thought
proper
authorize
the
president
to
employ
the
force
at
his
command
to
seize
a
vessel
belonging
to
an
american
citizen
which
had
been
illegally
and
unjustly
captured
in
a
foreign
port
and
restore
it
to
its
owner
but
can
congress
only
act
after
the
fact
after
the
mischief
has
been
done
have
they
no
power
to
confer
upon
the
president
the
authority
in
advance
to
furnish
instant
redress
should
such
a
case
afterwards
occur
must
they
wait
until
the
mischief
has
been
done
and
can
they
apply
the
remedy
only
when
it
is
too
late
to
confer
this
authority
to
meet
future
cases
under
circumstances
strictly
specified
is
as
clearly
within
the
wardeclaring
power
as
such
an
authority
conferred
upon
the
president
by
act
of
congress
after
the
deed
had
been
done
in
the
progress
of
a
great
nation
many
exigencies
must
arise
imperatively
requiring
that
congress
should
authorize
the
president
to
act
promptly
on
certain
conditions
which
may
or
may
not
afterwards
arise
our
history
has
already
presented
a
number
of
such
cases
i
shall
refer
only
to
the
latest
under
the
resolution
of
june
for
the
adjustment
of
difficulties
with
the
republic
of
paraguay
the
president
is
authorized
to
adopt
such
measures
and
use
such
force
as
in
his
judgment
may
be
necessary
and
advisable
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
of
just
satisfaction
by
the
government
of
paraguay
just
satisfaction
for
what
for
the
attack
on
the
united
states
steamer
water
witch
and
other
matters
referred
to
in
the
annual
message
of
the
president
here
the
power
is
expressly
granted
upon
the
condition
that
the
government
of
paraguay
shall
refuse
to
render
this
just
satisfaction
in
this
and
other
similar
cases
congress
have
conferred
upon
the
president
power
in
advance
to
employ
the
army
and
navy
upon
the
happening
of
contingent
future
events
and
this
most
certainly
is
embraced
within
the
power
to
declare
war
now
if
this
conditional
and
contingent
power
could
be
constitutionally
conferred
upon
the
president
in
the
case
of
paraguay
why
may
it
not
be
conferred
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
lives
and
property
of
american
citizens
in
the
event
that
they
may
be
violently
and
unlawfully
attacked
in
passing
over
the
transit
routes
to
and
from
california
or
assailed
by
the
seizure
of
their
vessels
in
a
foreign
port
to
deny
this
power
is
to
render
the
navy
in
a
great
degree
useless
for
the
protection
of
the
lives
and
property
of
american
citizens
in
countries
where
neither
protection
nor
redress
can
be
otherwise
obtained
the
thirtyfifth
congress
terminated
on
the
d
of
march
without
having
passed
the
act
making
appropriations
for
the
service
of
the
postoffice
department
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
the
th
of
june
this
act
also
contained
an
appropriation
to
supply
deficiencies
in
the
revenue
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
year
ending
th
june
i
believe
this
is
the
first
instance
since
the
origin
of
the
federal
government
now
more
than
seventy
years
ago
when
any
congress
went
out
of
existence
without
having
passed
all
the
general
appropriation
bills
necessary
to
carry
on
the
government
until
the
regular
period
for
the
meeting
of
a
new
congress
this
event
imposed
on
the
executive
a
grave
responsibility
it
presented
a
choice
of
evils
had
this
omission
of
duty
occurred
at
the
first
session
of
the
last
congress
the
remedy
would
have
been
plain
i
might
then
have
instantly
recalled
them
to
complete
their
work
and
this
without
expense
to
the
government
but
on
the
th
of
march
last
there
were
fifteen
of
the
thirtythree
states
which
had
not
elected
any
representatives
to
the
present
congress
had
congress
been
called
together
immediately
these
states
would
have
been
virtually
disfranchised
if
an
intermediate
period
had
been
selected
several
of
the
states
would
have
been
compelled
to
hold
extra
sessions
of
their
legislatures
at
great
inconvenience
and
expense
to
provide
for
elections
at
an
earlier
day
than
that
previously
fixed
by
law
in
the
regular
course
ten
of
these
states
would
not
elect
until
after
the
beginning
of
august
and
five
of
these
ten
not
until
october
and
november
on
the
other
hand
when
i
came
to
examine
carefully
the
condition
of
the
postoffice
department
i
did
not
meet
as
many
or
as
great
difficulties
as
i
had
apprehended
had
the
bill
which
failed
been
confined
to
appropriations
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
june
next
there
would
have
been
no
reason
of
pressing
importance
for
the
call
of
an
extra
session
nothing
would
become
due
on
contracts
those
with
railroad
companies
only
excepted
for
carrying
the
mail
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
fiscal
year
commencing
on
the
st
of
july
until
the
st
of
decemberless
than
one
week
before
the
meeting
of
the
present
congress
the
reason
is
that
the
mail
contractors
for
this
and
the
current
year
did
not
complete
their
first
quarters
service
until
the
th
september
last
and
by
the
terms
of
their
contracts
sixty
days
more
are
allowed
for
the
settlement
of
their
accounts
before
the
department
could
be
called
upon
for
payment
the
great
difficulty
and
the
great
hardship
consisted
in
the
failure
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
deficiency
in
the
fiscal
year
ending
the
th
june
the
department
had
entered
into
contracts
in
obedience
to
existing
laws
for
the
service
of
that
fiscal
year
and
the
contractors
were
fairly
entitled
to
their
compensation
as
it
became
due
the
deficiency
as
stated
in
the
bill
amounted
to
but
after
a
careful
settlement
of
all
these
accounts
it
has
been
ascertained
that
it
amounts
to
with
the
scanty
means
at
his
command
the
postmastergeneral
has
managed
to
pay
that
portion
of
this
deficiency
which
occurred
in
the
first
two
quarters
of
the
past
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
st
december
last
in
the
meantime
the
contractors
themselves
under
these
trying
circumstances
have
behaved
in
a
manner
worthy
of
all
commendation
they
had
one
resource
in
the
midst
of
their
embarrassments
after
the
amount
due
to
each
of
them
had
been
ascertained
and
finally
settled
according
to
law
this
became
a
specific
debt
of
record
against
the
united
states
which
enabled
them
to
borrow
money
on
this
unquestionable
security
still
they
were
obliged
to
pay
interest
in
consequence
of
the
default
of
congress
and
on
every
principle
of
justice
ought
to
receive
interest
from
the
government
this
interest
should
commence
from
the
date
when
a
warrant
would
have
issued
for
the
payment
of
the
principal
had
an
appropriation
been
made
for
this
purpose
calculated
up
to
the
st
december
it
will
not
exceed
a
sum
not
to
be
taken
into
account
when
contrasted
with
the
great
difficulties
and
embarrassments
of
a
public
and
private
character
both
to
the
people
and
the
states
which
would
have
resulted
from
convening
and
holding
a
special
session
of
congress
for
these
reasons
i
recommend
the
passage
of
a
bill
at
as
early
a
day
as
may
be
practicable
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
amount
with
interest
due
to
these
lastmentioned
contractors
as
well
as
to
make
the
necessary
appropriations
for
the
service
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
current
fiscal
year
the
failure
to
pass
the
postoffice
bill
necessarily
gives
birth
to
serious
reflections
congress
by
refusing
to
pass
the
general
appropriation
bills
necessary
to
carry
on
the
government
may
not
only
arrest
its
action
but
might
even
destroy
its
existence
the
army
the
navy
the
judiciary
in
short
every
department
of
the
government
can
no
longer
perform
their
functions
if
congress
refuse
the
money
necessary
for
their
support
if
this
failure
should
teach
the
country
the
necessity
of
electing
a
full
congress
in
sufficient
time
to
enable
the
president
to
convene
them
in
any
emergency
even
immediately
after
the
old
congress
has
exp
ired
it
will
have
been
productive
of
great
good
in
a
time
of
sudden
and
alarming
danger
foreign
or
domestic
which
all
nations
must
expect
to
encounter
in
their
progress
the
very
salvation
of
our
institutions
may
be
staked
upon
the
assembling
of
congress
without
delay
if
under
such
circumstances
the
president
should
find
himself
in
the
condition
in
which
he
was
placed
at
the
close
of
the
last
congress
with
nearly
half
the
states
of
the
union
destitute
of
representatives
the
consequences
might
he
disastrous
i
therefore
recommend
to
congress
to
carry
into
effect
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
on
this
subject
and
to
pass
a
law
appointing
some
day
previous
to
the
th
march
in
each
year
of
odd
number
for
the
election
of
representatives
throughout
all
the
states
they
have
already
appointed
a
day
for
the
election
of
electors
for
president
and
vicepresident
and
this
measure
has
been
approved
by
the
country
i
would
again
express
a
most
decided
opinion
in
favor
of
the
construction
of
a
pacific
railroad
for
the
reasons
stated
in
my
two
last
annual
messages
when
i
reflect
upon
what
would
be
the
defenseless
condition
of
our
states
and
territories
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
case
of
a
war
with
a
naval
power
sufficiently
strong
to
interrupt
all
intercourse
with
them
by
the
routes
across
the
isthmus
i
am
still
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
vast
importance
of
this
railroad
i
have
never
doubted
the
constitutional
competency
of
congress
to
provide
for
its
construction
but
this
exclusively
under
the
warmaking
power
besides
the
constitution
expressly
requires
as
an
imperative
duty
that
the
united
states
shall
protect
each
of
them
the
states
against
invasion
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
this
protection
can
be
afforded
to
california
and
oregon
against
such
a
naval
power
by
any
other
means
i
repeat
the
opinion
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
that
it
would
be
inexpedient
for
the
government
to
undertake
this
great
work
by
agents
of
its
own
appointment
and
under
its
direct
and
exclusive
control
this
would
increase
the
patronage
of
the
executive
to
a
dangerous
extent
and
would
foster
a
system
of
jobbing
and
corruption
which
no
vigilance
on
the
part
of
federal
officials
could
prevent
the
construction
of
this
road
ought
therefore
to
be
intrusted
to
incorporated
companies
or
other
agencies
who
would
exercise
that
active
and
vigilant
supervision
over
it
which
can
be
inspired
alone
by
a
sense
of
corporate
and
individual
interest
i
venture
to
assert
that
the
additional
cost
of
transporting
troops
munitions
of
war
and
necessary
supplies
for
the
army
across
the
vast
intervening
plains
to
our
possessions
on
the
pacific
coast
would
be
greater
in
such
a
war
than
the
whole
amount
required
to
construct
the
road
and
yet
this
resort
would
after
all
be
inadequate
for
their
defense
and
protection
we
have
yet
scarcely
recovered
from
the
habits
of
extravagant
expenditure
produced
by
our
overflowing
treasury
during
several
years
prior
to
the
commencement
of
my
administration
the
financial
reverses
which
we
have
since
experienced
ought
to
teach
us
all
to
scrutinize
our
expenditures
with
the
greatest
vigilance
and
to
reduce
them
to
the
lowest
possible
point
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
have
devoted
themselves
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
with
considerable
success
as
will
appear
from
their
different
reports
and
estimates
to
these
i
invite
the
scrutiny
of
congress
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
them
still
lower
if
this
be
practicable
consistent
with
the
great
public
interests
of
the
country
in
aid
of
the
policy
of
retrenchment
i
pledge
myself
to
examine
closely
the
bills
appropriating
lands
or
money
so
that
if
any
of
these
should
inadvertently
pass
both
houses
as
must
sometimes
be
the
case
i
may
afford
them
an
opportunity
for
reconsideration
at
the
same
time
we
ought
never
to
forget
that
true
public
economy
consists
not
in
withholding
the
means
necessary
to
accomplish
important
national
objects
confided
to
us
by
the
constitution
but
in
taking
care
that
the
money
appropriated
for
these
purposes
shall
be
faithfully
and
frugally
expended
it
will
appear
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
it
is
extremely
doubtful
to
say
the
least
whether
we
shall
be
able
to
pass
through
the
present
and
the
next
fiscal
year
without
providing
additional
revenue
this
can
only
be
accomplished
by
strictly
confining
the
appropriations
within
the
estimates
of
the
different
departments
without
making
an
allowance
for
any
additional
expenditures
which
congress
may
think
proper
in
their
discretion
to
authorize
and
without
providing
for
the
redemption
of
any
portion
of
the
of
treasury
notes
which
have
been
already
issued
in
the
event
of
a
deficiency
which
i
consider
probable
this
ought
never
to
be
supplied
by
a
resort
to
additional
loans
it
would
be
a
ruinous
practice
in
the
days
of
peace
and
prosperity
to
go
on
increasing
the
national
debt
to
meet
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
this
policy
would
cripple
our
resources
and
impair
our
credit
in
case
the
existence
of
war
should
render
it
necessary
to
borrow
money
should
such
a
deficiency
occur
as
i
apprehend
i
would
recommend
that
the
necessary
revenue
be
raised
by
an
increase
of
our
present
duties
on
imports
i
need
not
repeat
the
opinions
expressed
in
my
last
annual
message
as
to
the
best
mode
and
manner
of
accomplishing
this
object
and
shall
now
merely
observe
that
these
have
since
undergone
no
change
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
explain
in
detail
the
operations
of
that
department
of
the
government
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
from
all
sources
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
including
the
loan
authorized
by
the
act
of
june
and
the
issues
of
treasury
notes
authorized
by
existing
laws
were
which
sum
with
the
balance
of
remaining
in
the
treasury
at
the
commencement
of
that
fiscal
year
made
an
aggregate
for
the
service
of
the
year
of
the
public
expenditures
during
the
fiscal

ending

amounted
to

this
sum
were
applied
to
the
payment
of

of
the

the

for

of

postmastergeneral
they
each
contain
valuable
information
and
important
recommendations
well
worthy
of
the
serious
consideration
of
congress
it
will
appear
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
the
army
expenditures
have
been
materially
reduced
by
a
system
of
rigid
economy
which
in
his
opinion
offers
every
guaranty
that
the
reduction
will
be
permanent
the
estimates
of

been
reduced
nearly
below

explains
this
rapid
augmentation
of
the
expenditures
it
is
gratifying
however
to
observe
an
increase
of
receipts
for
the
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
equal
to
compared
with
those
in
the
year
ending
on
the
th
june
it
is
estimated
that
the
deficiency
for
the
current
fiscal
year
will
be
but
that
for
the
year
ending
th
june
it
will
not
exceed
should
congress
adopt
the
measures
of
reform
proposed
and
urged
by
the
postmastergeneral
since
the
month
of
march
retrenchments
have
been
made
in
the
expenditures
amounting
to
annually
which
however
did
not
take
effect
until
after
the
commencement
of
the
present
fiscal
year
the
period
seems
to
have
arrived
for
determining
the
question
whether
this
department
shall
become
a
permanent
and
everincreasing
charge
upon
the
treasury
or
shall
be
permitted
to
resume
the
selfsustaining
policy
which
had
so
long
controlled
its
administration
the
course
of
legislation
recommended
by
the
postmastergeneral
for
the
relief
of
the
department
from
its
present
embarrassments
and
for
restoring
it
to
its
original
independence
is
deserving
of
your
early
and
earnest
consideration
in
conclusion
i
would
again
commend
to
the
just
liberality
of
congress
the
local
interests
of
the
district
of
columbia
surely
the
city
bearing
the
name
of
washington
and
destined
i
trust
for
ages
to
be
the
capital
of
our
united
free
and
prosperous
confederacy
has
strong
claims
on
our
favorable
regard

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
when
we
compare
the
condition
of
the
country
at
the
present
day
with
what
it
was
one
year
ago
at
the
meeting
of
congress
we
have
much
reason
for
gratitude
to
that
almighty
providence
which
has
never
failed
to
interpose
for
our
relief
at
the
most
critical
periods
of
our
history
one
year
ago
the
sectional
strife
between
the
north
and
the
south
on
the
dangerous
subject
of
slavery
had
again
become
so
intense
as
to
threaten
the
peace
and
perpetuity
of
the
confederacy
the
application
for
the
admission
of
kansas
as
a
state
into
the
union
fostered
this
unhappy
agitation
and
brought
the
whole
subject
once
more
before
congress
it
was
the
desire
of
every
patriot
that
such
measures
of
legislation
might
be
adopted
as
would
remove
the
excitement
from
the
states
and
confine
it
to
the
territory
where
it
legitimately
belonged
much
has
been
done
i
am
happy
to
say
toward
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
during
the
last
session
of
congress
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
previously
decided
that
all
american
citizens
have
an
equal
right
to
take
into
the
territories
whatever
is
held
as
property
under
the
laws
of
any
of
the
states
and
to
hold
such
property
there
under
the
guardianship
of
the
federal
constitution
so
long
as
the
territorial
condition
shall
remain
this
is
now
a
wellestablished
position
and
the
proceedings
of
the
last
session
were
alone
wanting
to
give
it
practical
effect
the
principle
has
been
recognized
in
some
form
or
other
by
an
almost
unanimous
vote
of
both
houses
of
congress
that
a
territory
has
a
right
to
come
into
the
union
either
as
a
free
or
a
slave
state
according
to
the
will
of
a
majority
of
its
people
the
just
equality
of
all
the
states
has
thus
been
vindicated
and
a
fruitful
source
of
dangerous
dissension
among
them
has
been
removed
whilst
such
has
been
the
beneficial
tendency
of
your
legislative
proceedings
outside
of
kansas
their
influence
has
nowhere
been
so
happy
as
within
that
territory
itself
left
to
manage
and
control
its
own
affairs
in
its
own
way
without
the
pressure
of
external
influence
the
revolutionary
topeka
organization
and
all
resistance
to
the
territorial
government
established
by
congress
have
been
finally
abandoned
as
a
natural
consequence
that
fine
territory
now
appears
to
be
tranquil
and
prosperous
and
is
attracting
increasing
thousands
of
immigrants
to
make
it
their
happy
home
the
past
unfortunate
experience
of
kansas
has
enforced
the
lesson
so
often
already
taught
that
resistance
to
lawful
authority
under
our
form
of
government
can
not
fail
in
the
end
to
prove
disastrous
to
its
authors
had
the
people
of
the
territory
yielded
obedience
to
the
laws
enacted
by
their
legislature
it
would
at
the
present
moment
have
contained
a
large
additional
population
of
industrious
and
enterprising
citizens
who
have
been
deterred
from
entering
its
borders
by
the
existence
of
civil
strife
and
organized
rebellion
it
was
the
resistance
to
rightful
authority
and
the
persevering
attempts
to
establish
a
revolutionary
government
under
the
topeka
constitution
which
caused
the
people
of
kansas
to
commit
the
grave
error
of
refusing
to
vote
for
delegates
to
the
convention
to
frame
a
constitution
under
a
law
not
denied
to
be
fair
and
just
in
its
provisions
this
refusal
to
vote
has
been
the
prolific
source
of
all
the
evils
which
have
followed
in
their
hostility
to
the
territorial
government
they
disregarded
the
principle
absolutely
essential
to
the
working
of
our
form
of
government
that
a
majority
of
those
who
vote
not
the
majority
who
may
remain
at
home
from
whatever
cause
must
decide
the
result
of
an
election
for
this
reason
seeking
to
take
advantage
of
their
own
error
they
denied
the
authority
of
the
convention
thus
elected
to
frame
a
constitution
the
convention
notwithstanding
proceeded
to
adopt
a
constitution
unexceptionable
in
its
general
features
and
providing
for
the
submission
of
the
slavery
question
to
a
vote
of
the
people
which
in
my
opinion
they
were
bound
to
do
under
the
kansas
and
nebraska
act
this
was
the
allimportant
question
which
had
alone
convulsed
the
territory
and
yet
the
opponents
of
the
lawful
government
persisting
in
their
first
error
refrained
from
exercising
their
right
to
vote
and
preferred
that
slavery
should
continue
rather
than
surrender
their
revolutionary
topeka
organization
a
wiser
and
better
spirit
seemed
to
prevail
before
the
first
monday
of
january
last
when
an
election
was
held
under
the
constitution
a
majority
of
the
people
then
voted
for
a
governor
and
other
state
officers
for
a
member
of
congress
and
members
of
the
state
legislature
this
election
was
warmly
contested
by
the
two
political
parties
in
kansas
and
a
greater
vote
was
polled
than
at
any
previous
election
a
large
majority
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
elect
belonged
to
that
party
which
had
previously
refused
to
vote
the
antislavery
party
were
thus
placed
in
the
ascendant
and
the
political
power
of
the
state
was
in
their
own
hands
had
congress
admitted
kansas
into
the
union
under
the
lecompton
constitution
the
legislature
might
at
its
very
first
session
have
submitted
the
question
to
a
vote
of
the
people
whether
they
would
or
would
not
have
a
convention
to
amend
their
constitution
either
on
the
slavery
or
any
other
question
and
have
adopted
all
necessary
means
for
giving
speedy
effect
to
the
will
of
the
majority
thus
the
kansas
question
would
have
been
immediately
and
finally
settled
under
these
circumstances
i
submitted
to
congress
the
constitution
thus
framed
with
all
the
officers
already
elected
necessary
to
put
the
state
government
into
operation
accompanied
by
a
strong
recommendation
in
favor
of
the
admission
of
kansas
as
a
state
in
the
course
of
my
long
public
life
i
have
never
performed
any
official
act
which
in
the
retrospect
has
afforded
me
more
heartfelt
satisfaction
its
admission
could
have
inflicted
no
possible
injury
on
any
human
being
whilst
it
would
within
a
brief
period
have
restored
peace
to
kansas
and
harmony
to
the
union
in
that
event
the
slavery
question
would
ere
this
have
been
finally
settled
according
to
the
legally
expressed
will
of
a
majority
of
the
voters
and
popular
sovereignty
would
thus
have
been
vindicated
in
a
constitutional
manner
with
my
deep
convictions
of
duty
i
could
have
pursued
no
other
course
it
is
true
that
as
an
individual
i
had
expressed
an
opinion
both
before
and
during
the
session
of
the
convention
in
favor
of
submitting
the
remaining
clauses
of
the
constitution
as
well
as
that
concerning
slavery
to
the
people
but
acting
in
an
official
character
neither
myself
nor
any
human
authority
had
the
power
to
rejudge
the
proceedings
of
the
convention
and
declare
the
constitution
which
it
had
framed
to
be
a
nullity
to
have
done
this
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
kansas
and
nebraska
act
which
left
the
people
of
the
territory
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
subject
only
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
would
equally
have
violated
the
great
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
at
the
foundation
of
our
institutions
to
deprive
the
people
of
the
power
if
they
thought
proper
to
exercise
it
of
confiding
to
delegates
elected
by
themselves
the
trust
of
framing
a
constitution
without
requiring
them
to
subject
their
constituents
to
the
trouble
expense
and
delay
of
a
second
election
it
would
have
been
in
opposition
to
many
precedents
in
our
history
commencing
in
the
very
best
age
of
the
republic
of
the
admission
of
territories
as
states
into
the
union
without
a
previous
vote
of
the
people
approving
their
constitution
it
is
to
be
lamented
that
a
question
so
insignificant
when
viewed
in
its
practical
effects
on
the
people
of
kansas
whether
decided
one
way
or
the
other
should
have
kindled
such
a
flame
of
excitement
throughout
the
country
this
reflection
may
prove
to
be
a
lesson
of
wisdom
and
of
warning
for
our
future
guidance
practically
considered
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
people
of
that
territory
should
first
come
into
the
union
and
then
change
any
provision
in
their
constitution
not
agreeable
to
themselves
or
accomplish
the
very
same
object
by
remaining
out
of
the
union
and
framing
another
constitution
in
accordance
with
their
will
in
either
case
the
result
would
be
precisely
the
same
the
only
difference
in
point
of
fact
is
that
the
object
would
have
been
much
sooner
attained
and
the
pacification
of
kansas
more
speedily
effected
had
it
been
admitted
as
a
state
during
the
last
session
of
congress
my
recommendation
however
for
the
immediate
admission
of
kansas
failed
to
meet
the
approbation
of
congress
they
deemed
it
wiser
to
adopt
a
different
measure
for
the
settlement
of
the
question
for
my
own
part
i
should
have
been
willing
to
yield
my
assent
to
almost
any
constitutional
measure
to
accomplish
this
object
i
therefore
cordially
acquiesced
in
what
has
been
called
the
english
compromise
and
approved
the
act
for
the
admission
of
the
state
of
kansas
into
the
union
upon
the
terms
therein
prescribed
under
the
ordinance
which
accompanied
the
lecompton
constitution
the
people
of
kansas
had
claimed
double
the
quantity
of
public
lands
for
the
support
of
common
schools
which
had
ever
been
previously
granted
to
any
state
upon
entering
the
union
and
also
the
alternate
sections
of
land
for
miles
on
each
side
of
two
railroads
proposed
to
be
constructed
from
the
northern
to
the
southern
boundary
and
from
the
eastern
to
the
western
boundary
of
the
state
congress
deeming
these
claims
unreasonable
provided
by
the
act
of
may
to
which
i
have
just
referred
for
the
admission
of
the
state
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
but
upon
the
fundamental
condition
precedent
that
a
majority
of
the
people
thereof
at
an
election
to
be
held
for
that
purpose
should
in
place
of
the
very
large
grants
of
public
lands
which
they
had
demanded
under
the
ordinance
accept
such
grants
as
had
been
made
to
minnesota
and
other
new
states
under
this
act
should
a
majority
reject
the
propositi
on
offered
them
it
shall
be
deemed
and
held
that
the
people
of
kansas
do
not
desire
admission
into
the
union
with
said
constitution
under
the
conditions
set
forth
in
said
proposition
in
that
event
the
act
authorizes
the
people
of
the
territory
to
elect
delegates
to
form
a
constitution
and
state
government
for
themselves
whenever
and
not
before
it
is
ascertained
by
a
census
duly
and
legally
taken
that
the
population
of
said
territory
equals
or
exceeds
the
ratio
of
representation
required
for
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
delegates
thus
assembled
shall
first
determine
by
a
vote
whether
it
is
the
wish
of
the
people
of
the
proposed
state
to
be
admitted
into
the
union
at
that
time
and
if
so
shall
proceed
to
form
a
constitution
and
take
all
necessary
steps
for
the
establishment
of
a
state
government
in
conformity
with
the
federal
constitution
after
this
constitution
shall
have
been
formed
congress
carrying
out
the
principles
of
popular
sovereignty
and
nonintervention
have
left
the
mode
and
manner
of
its
approval
or
ratification
by
the
people
of
the
proposed
state
to
be
prescribed
by
law
and
they
shall
then
be
admitted
into
the
union
as
a
state
under
such
constitution
thus
fairly
and
legally
made
with
or
without
slavery
as
said
constitution
may
prescribe
an
election
was
held
throughout
kansas
in
pursuance
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
on
the
d
day
of
august
last
and
it
resulted
in
the
rejection
by
a
large
majority
of
the
proposition
submitted
to
the
people
by
congress
this
being
the
case
they
are
now
authorized
to
form
another
constitution
preparatory
to
admission
into
the
union
but
not
until
their
number
as
ascertained
by
a
census
shall
equal
or
exceed
the
ratio
required
to
elect
a
member
to
the
house
of
representatives
it
is
not
probable
in
the
present
state
of
the
case
that
a
third
constitution
can
be
lawfully
framed
and
presented
to
congress
by
kansas
before
its
population
shall
have
reached
the
designated
number
nor
is
it
to
be
presumed
that
after
their
sad
experience
in
resisting
the
territorial
laws
they
will
attempt
to
adopt
a
constitution
in
express
violation
of
the
provisions
of
an
act
of
congress
during
the
session
of
much
of
the
time
of
congress
was
occupied
on
the
question
of
admitting
kansas
under
the
topeka
constitution
again
nearly
the
whole
of
the
last
session
was
devoted
to
the
question
of
its
admission
under
the
lecompton
constitution
surely
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
require
the
people
of
kansas
to
wait
before
making
a
third
attempt
until
the
number
of
their
inhabitants
shall
amount
to
during
this
brief
period
the
harmony
of
the
states
as
well
as
the
great
business
interests
of
the
country
demand
that
the
people
of
the
union
shall
not
for
a
third
time
be
convulsed
by
another
agitation
on
the
kansas
question
by
waiting
for
a
short
time
and
acting
in
obedience
to
law
kansas
will
glide
into
the
union
without
the
slightest
impediment
this
excellent
provision
which
congress
have
applied
to
kansas
ought
to
be
extended
and
rendered
applicable
to
all
territories
which
may
hereafter
seek
admission
into
the
union
whilst
congress
possess
the
undoubted
power
of
admitting
a
new
state
into
the
union
however
small
may
be
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
yet
this
power
ought
not
in
my
opinion
to
be
exercised
before
the
population
shall
amount
to
the
ratio
required
by
the
act
for
the
admission
of
kansas
had
this
been
previously
the
rule
the
country
would
have
escaped
all
the
evils
and
misfortunes
to
which
it
has
been
exposed
by
the
kansas
question
of
course
it
would
be
unjust
to
give
this
rule
a
retrospective
application
and
exclude
a
state
which
acting
upon
the
past
practice
of
the
government
has
already
formed
its
constitution
elected
its
legislature
and
other
officers
and
is
now
prepared
to
enter
the
union
the
rule
ought
to
be
adopted
whether
we
consider
its
bearing
on
the
people
of
the
territories
or
upon
the
people
of
the
existing
states
many
of
the
serious
dissentions
which
have
prevailed
in
congress
and
throughout
the
country
would
have
been
avoided
had
this
rule
been
established
at
an
earlier
period
of
the
government
immediately
upon
the
formation
of
a
new
territory
people
from
different
states
and
from
foreign
countries
rush
into
it
for
the
laudable
purpose
of
improving
their
condition
their
first
duty
to
themselves
is
to
open
and
cultivate
farms
to
construct
roads
to
establish
schools
to
erect
places
of
religious
worship
and
to
devote
their
energies
generally
to
reclaim
the
wilderness
and
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
flourishing
and
prosperous
commonwealth
if
in
this
incipient
condition
with
a
population
of
a
few
thousand
they
should
prematurely
enter
the
union
they
are
oppressed
by
the
burden
of
state
taxation
and
the
means
necessary
for
the
improvement
of
the
territory
and
the
advancement
of
their
own
interests
are
thus
diverted
to
very
different
purposes
the
federal
government
has
ever
been
a
liberal
parent
to
the
territories
and
a
generous
contributor
to
the
useful
enterprises
of
the
early
settlers
it
has
paid
the
expenses
of
their
governments
and
legislative
assemblies
out
of
the
common
treasury
and
thus
relieved
them
from
a
heavy
charge
under
these
circumstances
nothing
can
be
better
calculated
to
retard
their
material
progress
than
to
divert
them
from
their
useful
employments
by
prematurely
exciting
angry
political
contests
among
themselves
for
the
benefit
of
aspiring
leaders
it
is
surely
no
hardship
for
embryo
governors
senators
and
members
of
congress
to
wait
until
the
number
of
inhabitants
shall
equal
those
of
a
single
congressional
district
they
surely
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
rush
into
the
union
with
a
population
less
than
onehalf
of
several
of
the
large
counties
in
the
interior
of
some
of
the
states
this
was
the
condition
of
kansas
when
it
made
application
to
be
admitted
under
the
topeka
constitution
besides
it
requires
some
time
to
render
the
mass
of
a
population
collected
in
a
new
territory
at
all
homogeneous
and
to
unite
them
on
anything
like
a
fixed
policy
establish
the
rule
and
all
will
look
forward
to
it
and
govern
themselves
accordingly
but
justice
to
the
people
of
the
several
states
requires
that
this
rule
should
be
established
by
congress
each
state
is
entitled
to
two
senators
and
at
least
one
representative
in
congress
should
the
people
of
the
states
fail
to
elect
a
vicepresident
the
power
devolves
upon
the
senate
to
select
this
officer
from
the
two
highest
candidates
on
the
list
in
case
of
the
death
of
the
president
the
vicepresident
thus
elected
by
the
senate
becomes
president
of
the
united
states
on
all
questions
of
legislation
the
senators
from
the
smallest
states
of
the
union
have
an
equal
vote
with
those
from
the
largest
the
same
may
be
said
in
regard
to
the
ratification
of
treaties
and
of
executive
appointments
all
this
has
worked
admirably
in
practice
whilst
it
conforms
in
principle
with
the
character
of
a
government
instituted
by
sovereign
states
i
presume
no
american
citizen
would
desire
the
slightest
change
in
the
arrangement
still
is
it
not
unjust
and
unequal
to
the
existing
states
to
invest
some
or
people
collected
in
a
territory
with
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
and
place
them
on
an
equal
footing
with
virginia
and
new
york
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
for
these
reasons
i
earnestly
recommend
the
passage
of
a
general
act
which
shall
provide
that
upon
the
application
of
a
territorial
legislature
declaring
their
belief
that
the
territory
contains
a
number
of
inhabitants
which
if
in
a
state
would
entitle
them
to
elect
a
member
of
congress
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
president
to
cause
a
census
of
the
inhabitants
to
be
taken
and
if
found
sufficient
then
by
the
terms
of
this
act
to
authorize
them
to
proceed
in
their
own
way
to
frame
a
state
constitution
preparatory
to
admission
into
the
union
i
also
recommend
that
an
appropriation
may
be
made
to
enable
the
president
to
take
a
census
of
the
people
of
kansas
the
present
condition
of
the
territory
of
utah
when
contrasted
with
what
it
was
one
year
ago
is
a
subject
for
congratulation
it
was
then
in
a
state
of
open
rebellion
and
cost
what
it
might
the
character
of
the
government
required
that
this
rebellion
should
be
suppressed
and
the
mormons
compelled
to
yield
obedience
to
the
constitution
and
the
laws
in
order
to
accomplish
this
object
as
i
informed
you
in
my
last
annual
message
i
appointed
a
new
governor
instead
of
brigham
young
and
other
federal
officers
to
take
the
place
of
those
who
consulting
their
personal
safety
had
found
it
necessary
to
withdraw
from
the
territory
to
protect
these
civil
officers
and
to
aid
them
as
a
posse
comitatus
in
the
execution
of
the
laws
in
case
of
need
i
ordered
a
detachment
of
the
army
to
accompany
them
to
utah
the
necessity
for
adopting
these
measures
is
now
demonstrated
on
the
th
of
september
governor
young
issued
his
proclamation
in
the
style
of
an
independent
sovereign
announcing
his
purpose
to
resist
by
force
of
arms
the
entry
of
the
united
states
troops
into
our
own
territory
of
utah
by
this
he
required
all
the
forces
in
the
territory
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
march
at
a
moments
notice
to
repel
any
and
all
such
invasion
and
established
martial
law
from
its
date
throughout
the
territory
these
proved
to
be
no
idle
threats
forts
bridger
and
supply
were
vacated
and
burnt
down
by
the
mormons
to
deprive
our
troops
of
a
shelter
after
their
long
and
fatiguing
march
orders
were
issued
by
daniel
h
wells
styling
himself
lieutenant
general
nauvoo
legion
to
stampede
the
animals
of
the
united
states
troops
on
their
march
to
set
fire
to
their
trains
to
burn
the
grass
and
the
whole
country
before
them
and
on
their
flanks
to
keep
them
from
sleeping
by
night
surprises
and
to
blockade
the
road
by
felling
trees
and
destroying
the
fords
of
rivers
etc
these
orders
were
promptly
and
effectually
obeyed
on
the
th
of
october
the
mormons
captured
and
burned
on
green
river
three
of
our
supply
trains
consisting
of
seventyfive
wagons
loaded
with
provi
sions
and
tents
for
the
army
and
carried
away
several
hundred
animals
this
diminished
the
supply
of
provisions
so
materially
that
general
johnston
was
obliged
to
reduce
the
ration
and
even
with
this
precaution
there
was
only
sufficient
left
to
subsist
the
troops
until
the
st
of
june
our
little
army
behaved
admirably
in
their
encampment
at
fort
bridger
under
these
trying
privations
in
the
midst
of
the
mountains
in
a
dreary
unsettled
and
inhospitable
region
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
home
they
passed
the
severe
and
inclement
winter
without
a
murmur
they
looked
forward
with
confidence
for
relief
from
their
country
in
due
season
and
in
this
they
were
not
disappointed
the
secretary
of
war
employed
all
his
energies
to
forward
them
the
necessary
supplies
and
to
muster
and
send
such
a
military
force
to
utah
as
would
render
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
mormons
hopeless
and
thus
terminate
the
war
without
the
effusion
of
blood
in
his
efforts
he
was
efficiently
sustained
by
congress
they
granted
appropriations
sufficient
to
cover
the
deficiency
thus
necessarily
created
and
also
provided
for
raising
two
regiments
of
volunteers
for
the
purpose
of
quelling
disturbances
in
the
territory
of
utah
for
the
protection
of
supply
and
emigrant
trains
and
the
suppression
of
indian
hostilities
on
the
frontiers
happily
there
was
no
occasion
to
call
these
regiments
into
service
if
there
had
been
i
should
have
felt
serious
embarrassment
in
selecting
them
so
great
was
the
number
of
our
brave
and
patriotic
citizens
anxious
to
serve
their
country
in
this
distant
and
apparently
dangerous
expedition
thus
it
has
ever
been
and
thus
may
it
ever
be
the
wisdom
and
economy
of
sending
sufficient
reenforcements
to
utah
are
established
not
only
by
the
event
but
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
from
their
position
and
opportunities
are
the
most
capable
of
forming
a
correct
judgment
general
johnston
the
commander
of
the
forces
in
addressing
the
secretary
of
war
from
fort
bridger
under
date
of
october
expresses
the
opinion
that
unless
a
large
force
is
sent
here
from
the
nature
of
the
country
a
protracted
war
on
their
the
mormonss
part
is
inevitable
this
he
considered
necessary
to
terminate
the
war
speedily
and
more
economically
than
if
attempted
by
insufficient
means
in
the
meantime
it
was
my
anxious
desire
that
the
mormons
should
yield
obedience
to
the
constitution
and
the
laws
without
rendering
it
necessary
to
resort
to
military
force
to
aid
in
accomplishing
this
object
i
deemed
it
advisable
in
april
last
to
dispatch
two
distinguished
citizens
of
the
united
states
messrs
powell
and
mcculloch
to
utah
they
bore
with
them
a
proclamation
addressed
by
myself
to
the
inhabitants
of
utah
dated
on
the
th
day
of
that
month
warning
them
of
their
true
condition
and
how
hopeless
it
was
on
their
part
to
persist
in
rebellion
against
the
united
states
and
offering
all
those
who
should
submit
to
the
laws
a
full
pardon
for
their
past
seditions
and
treasons
at
the
same
time
i
assured
those
who
should
persist
in
rebellion
against
the
united
states
that
they
must
expect
no
further
lenity
but
look
to
be
rigorously
dealt
with
according
to
their
deserts
the
instructions
to
these
agents
as
well
as
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
and
their
reports
are
herewith
submitted
it
will
be
seen
by
their
report
of
the
d
of
july
last
that
they
have
fully
confirmed
the
opinion
expressed
by
general
johnston
in
the
previous
october
as
to
the
necessity
of
sending
reenforcements
to
utah
in
this
they
state
that
they
are
firmly
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
presence
of
the
army
here
and
the
large
additional
force
that
had
been
ordered
to
this
territory
were
the
chief
inducements
that
caused
the
mormons
to
abandon
the
idea
of
resisting
the
authority
of
the
united
states
a
less
decisive
policy
would
probably
have
resulted
in
a
long
bloody
and
expensive
war
these
gentlemen
conducted
themselves
to
my
entire
satisfaction
and
rendered
useful
services
in
executing
the
humane
intentions
of
the
government
it
also
affords
me
great
satisfaction
to
state
that
governor
cumming
has
performed
his
duty
in
an
able
and
conciliatory
manner
and
with
the
happiest
effect
i
can
not
in
this
connection
refrain
from
mentioning
the
valuable
services
of
colonel
thomas
l
kane
who
from
motives
of
pure
benevolence
and
without
any
official
character
or
pecuniary
compensation
visited
utah
during
the
last
inclement
winter
for
the
purpose
of
contributing
to
the
pacification
of
the
territory
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
the
governor
and
other
civil
officers
of
utah
are
now
performing
their
appropriate
functions
without
resistance
the
authority
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
has
been
fully
restored
and
peace
prevails
throughout
the
territory
a
portion
of
the
troops
sent
to
utah
are
now
encamped
in
cedar
valley
miles
southwest
of
salt
lake
city
and
the
remainder
have
been
ordered
to
oregon
to
suppress
indian
hostilities
the
march
of
the
army
to
salt
lake
city
through
the
indian
territory
has
had
a
powerful
effect
in
restraining
the
hostile
feelings
against
the
united
states
which
existed
among
the
indians
in
that
region
and
in
securing
emigrants
to
the
far
west
against
their
depredations
this
will
also
be
the
means
of
establishing
military
posts
and
promoting
settlements
along
the
route
i
recommend
that
the
benefits
of
our
land
laws
and
preemption
system
be
extended
to
the
people
of
utah
by
the
establishment
of
a
land
office
in
that
territory
i
have
occasion
also
to
congratulate
you
on
the
result
of
our
negotiations
with
china
you
were
informed
by
my
last
annual
message
that
our
minister
had
been
instructed
to
occupy
a
neutral
position
in
the
hostilities
conducted
by
great
britain
and
france
against
canton
he
was
however
at
the
same
time
directed
to
cooperate
cordially
with
the
british
and
french
ministers
in
all
peaceful
measures
to
secure
by
treaty
those
just
concessions
to
foreign
commerce
which
the
nations
of
the
world
had
a
right
to
demand
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
proceed
further
than
this
on
my
own
authority
without
usurping
the
warmaking
power
which
under
the
constitution
belongs
exclusively
to
congress
besides
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
our
grievances
i
did
not
believe
they
were
of
such
a
pressing
and
aggravated
character
as
would
have
justified
congress
in
declaring
war
against
the
chinese
empire
without
first
making
another
earnest
attempt
to
adjust
them
by
peaceful
negotiation
i
was
the
more
inclined
to
this
opinion
because
of
the
severe
chastisement
which
had
then
but
recently
been
inflicted
upon
the
chinese
by
our
squadron
in
the
capture
and
destruction
of
the
barrier
forts
to
avenge
an
alleged
insult
to
our
flag
the
event
has
proved
the
wisdom
of
our
neutrality
our
minister
has
executed
his
instructions
with
eminent
skill
and
ability
in
conjunction
with
the
russian
plenipotentiary
he
has
peacefully
but
effectually
cooperated
with
the
english
and
french
plenipotentiaries
and
each
of
the
four
powers
has
concluded
a
separate
treaty
with
china
of
a
highly
satisfactory
character
the
treaty
concluded
by
our
own
plenipotentiary
will
immediately
be
submitted
to
the
senate
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
through
the
energetic
yet
conciliatory
efforts
of
our
consulgeneral
in
japan
a
new
treaty
has
been
concluded
with
that
empire
which
may
be
expected
materially
to
augment
our
trade
and
intercourse
in
that
quarter
and
remove
from
our
countrymen
the
disabilities
which
have
heretofore
been
imposed
upon
the
exercise
of
their
religion
the
treaty
shall
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
approval
without
delay
it
is
my
earnest
desire
that
every
misunderstanding
with
the
government
of
great
britain
should
be
amicably
and
speedily
adjusted
it
has
been
the
misfortune
of
both
countries
almost
ever
since
the
period
of
the
revolution
to
have
been
annoyed
by
a
succession
of
irritating
and
dangerous
questions
threatening
their
friendly
relations
this
has
partially
prevented
the
full
development
of
those
feelings
of
mutual
friendship
between
the
people
of
the
two
countries
so
natural
in
themselves
and
so
conducive
to
their
common
interest
any
serious
interruption
of
the
commerce
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
would
be
equally
injurious
to
both
in
fact
no
two
nations
have
ever
existed
on
the
face
of
the
earth
which
could
do
each
other
so
much
good
or
so
much
harm
entertaining
these
sentiments
i
am
gratified
to
inform
you
that
the
longpending
controversy
between
the
two
governments
in
relation
to
the
question
of
visitation
and
search
has
been
amicably
adjusted
the
claim
on
the
part
of
great
britain
forcibly
to
visit
american
vessels
on
the
high
seas
in
time
of
peace
could
not
be
sustained
under
the
law
of
nations
and
it
had
been
overruled
by
her
own
most
eminent
jurists
this
question
was
recently
brought
to
an
issue
by
the
repeated
acts
of
british
cruisers
in
boarding
and
searching
our
merchant
vessels
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
adjacent
seas
these
acts
were
the
more
injurious
and
annoying
as
these
waters
are
traversed
by
a
large
portion
of
the
commerce
and
navigation
of
the
united
states
and
their
free
and
unrestricted
use
is
essential
to
the
security
of
the
coastwise
trade
between
the
different
states
of
the
union
such
vexatious
interruptions
could
not
fail
to
excite
the
feelings
of
the
country
and
to
require
the
interposition
of
the
government
remonstrances
were
addressed
to
the
british
government
against
these
violations
of
our
rights
of
sovereignty
and
a
naval
force
was
at
the
same
time
ordered
to
the
cuban
waters
with
directions
to
protect
all
vessels
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas
from
search
or
detention
by
the
vessels
of
war
of
any
other
nation
these
measures
received
the
unqualified
and
even
enthusiastic
approbation
of
the
american
people
most
fortunately
however
no
collision
took
place
and
the
british
government
promptly
avowed
its
recognition
of
the
principles
of
international
law
upon
this
subject
as
laid
down
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
note
of
the
secretary
of
st
ate
to
the
british
minister
at
washington
of
april
which
secure
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
upon
the
high
seas
from
visitation
or
search
in
time
of
peace
under
any
circumstances
whatever
the
claim
has
been
abandoned
in
a
manner
reflecting
honor
on
the
british
government
and
evincing
a
just
regard
for
the
law
of
nations
and
can
not
fail
to
strengthen
the
amicable
relations
between
the
two
countries
the
british
government
at
the
same
time
proposed
to
the
united
states
that
some
mode
should
be
adopted
by
mutual
arrangement
between
the
two
countries
of
a
character
which
may
be
found
effective
without
being
offensive
for
verifying
the
nationality
of
vessels
suspected
on
good
grounds
of
carrying
false
colors
they
have
also
invited
the
united
states
to
take
the
initiative
and
propose
measures
for
this
purpose
whilst
declining
to
assume
so
grave
a
responsibility
the
secretary
of
state
has
informed
the
british
government
that
we
are
ready
to
receive
any
proposals
which
they
may
feel
disposed
to
offer
having
this
object
in
view
and
to
consider
them
in
an
amicable
spirit
a
strong
opinion
is
however
expressed
that
the
occasional
abuse
of
the
flag
of
any
nation
is
an
evil
far
less
to
be
deprecated
than
would
be
the
establishment
of
any
regulations
which
might
be
incompatible
with
the
freedom
of
the
seas
this
government
has
yet
received
no
communication
specifying
the
manner
in
which
the
british
government
would
propose
to
carry
out
their
suggestion
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
no
plan
which
can
be
devised
will
be
free
from
grave
embarrassments
still
i
shall
form
no
decided
opinion
on
the
subject
until
i
shall
have
carefully
and
in
the
best
spirit
examined
any
proposals
which
they
may
think
proper
to
make
i
am
truly
sorry
i
can
not
also
inform
you
that
the
complications
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
arising
out
of
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
of
april
have
been
finally
adjusted
at
the
commencement
of
your
last
session
i
had
reason
to
hope
that
emancipating
themselves
from
further
unavailing
discussions
the
two
governments
would
proceed
to
settle
the
central
american
questions
in
a
practical
manner
alike
honorable
and
satisfactory
to
both
and
this
hope
i
have
not
yet
abandoned
in
my
last
annual
message
i
stated
that
overtures
had
been
made
by
the
british
government
for
this
purpose
in
a
friendly
spirit
which
i
cordially
reciprocated
their
proposal
was
to
withdraw
these
questions
from
direct
negotiation
between
the
two
governments
but
to
accomplish
the
same
object
by
a
negotiation
between
the
british
government
and
each
of
the
central
american
republics
whose
territorial
interests
are
immediately
involved
the
settlement
was
to
be
made
in
accordance
with
the
general
tenor
of
the
interpretation
placed
upon
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
by
the
united
states
with
certain
modifications
as
negotiations
are
still
pending
upon
this
basis
it
would
not
be
proper
for
me
now
to
communicate
their
present
condition
a
final
settlement
of
these
questions
is
greatly
to
be
desired
as
this
would
wipe
out
the
last
remaining
subject
of
dispute
between
the
two
countries
our
relations
with
the
great
empires
of
france
and
russia
as
well
as
with
all
other
governments
on
the
continent
of
europe
except
that
of
spain
continue
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
with
spain
our
relations
remain
in
an
unsatisfactory
condition
in
my
message
of
december
last
i
informed
you
that
our
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
madrid
had
asked
for
his
recall
and
it
was
my
purpose
to
send
out
a
new
minister
to
that
court
with
special
instructions
on
all
questions
pending
between
the
two
governments
and
with
a
determination
to
have
them
speedily
and
amicably
adjusted
if
that
were
possible
this
purpose
has
been
hitherto
defeated
by
causes
which
i
need
not
enumerate
the
mission
to
spain
has
been
intrusted
to
a
distinguished
citizen
of
kentucky
who
will
proceed
to
madrid
without
delay
and
make
another
and
a
final
attempt
to
obtain
justice
from
that
government
spanish
officials
under
the
direct
control
of
the
captaingeneral
of
cuba
have
insulted
our
national
flag
and
in
repeated
instances
have
from
time
to
time
inflicted
injuries
on
the
persons
and
property
of
our
citizens
these
have
given
birth
to
numerous
claims
against
the
spanish
government
the
merits
of
which
have
been
ably
discussed
for
a
series
of
years
by
our
successive
diplomatic
representatives
notwithstanding
this
we
have
not
arrived
at
a
practical
result
in
any
single
instance
unless
we
may
except
the
case
of
the
black
warrior
under
the
late
administration
and
that
presented
an
outrage
of
such
a
character
as
would
have
justified
an
immediate
resort
to
war
all
our
attempts
to
obtain
redress
have
been
baffled
and
defeated
the
frequent
and
oftrecurring
changes
in
the
spanish
ministry
have
been
employed
as
reasons
for
delay
we
have
been
compelled
to
wait
again
and
again
until
the
new
minister
shall
have
had
time
to
investigate
the
justice
of
our
demands
even
what
have
been
denominated
the
cuban
claims
in
which
more
than
of
our
citizens
are
directly
interested
have
furnished
no
exception
these
claims
were
for
the
refunding
of
duties
unjustly
exacted
from
american
vessels
at
different
customhouses
in
cuba
so
long
ago
as
the
year
the
principles
upon
which
they
rest
are
so
manifestly
equitable
and
just
that
after
a
period
of
nearly
ten
years
in
they
were
recognized
by
the
spanish
government
proceedings
were
afterwards
instituted
to
ascertain
their
amount
and
this
was
finally
fixed
according
to
their
own
statement
with
which
we
were
satisfied
at
the
sum
of
just
at
the
moment
after
a
delay
of
fourteen
years
when
we
had
reason
to
expect
that
this
sum
would
be
repaid
with
interest
we
have
received
a
proposal
offering
to
refund
onethird
of
that
amount
but
without
interest
if
we
would
accept
this
in
full
satisfaction
the
offer
is
also
accompanied
by
a
declaration
that
this
indemnification
is
not
founded
on
any
reason
of
strict
justice
but
is
made
as
a
special
favor
one
alleged
cause
for
procrastination
in
the
examination
and
adjustment
of
our
claims
arises
from
an
obstacle
which
it
is
the
duty
of
the
spanish
government
to
remove
whilst
the
captaingeneral
of
cuba
is
invested
with
general
despotic
authority
in
the
government
of
that
island
the
power
is
withheld
from
him
to
examine
and
redress
wrongs
committed
by
officials
under
his
control
on
citizens
of
the
united
states
instead
of
making
our
complaints
directly
to
him
at
havana
we
are
obliged
to
present
them
through
our
minister
at
madrid
these
are
then
referred
back
to
the
captaingeneral
for
information
and
much
time
is
thus
consumed
in
preliminary
investigations
and
correspondence
between
madrid
and
cuba
before
the
spanish
government
will
consent
to
proceed
to
negotiation
many
of
the
difficulties
between
the
two
governments
would
be
obviated
and
a
long
train
of
negotiation
avoided
if
the
captaingeneral
were
invested
with
authority
to
settle
questions
of
easy
solution
on
the
spot
where
all
the
facts
are
fresh
and
could
be
promptly
and
satisfactorily
ascertained
we
have
hitherto
in
vain
urged
upon
the
spanish
government
to
confer
this
power
upon
the
captaingeneral
and
our
minister
to
spain
will
again
be
instructed
to
urge
this
subject
on
their
notice
in
this
respect
we
occupy
a
different
position
from
the
powers
of
europe
cuba
is
almost
within
sight
of
our
shores
our
commerce
with
it
is
far
greater
than
that
of
any
other
nation
including
spain
itself
and
our
citizens
are
in
habits
of
daily
and
extended
personal
intercourse
with
every
part
of
the
island
it
is
therefore
a
great
grievance
that
when
any
difficulty
occurs
no
matter
how
unimportant
which
might
be
readily
settled
at
the
moment
we
should
be
obliged
to
resort
to
madrid
especially
when
the
very
first
step
to
be
taken
there
is
to
refer
it
back
to
cuba
the
truth
is
that
cuba
in
its
existing
colonial
condition
is
a
constant
source
of
injury
and
annoyance
to
the
american
people
it
is
the
only
spot
in
the
civilized
world
where
the
african
slave
trade
is
tolerated
and
we
are
bound
by
treaty
with
great
britain
to
maintain
a
naval
force
on
the
coast
of
africa
at
much
expense
both
of
life
and
treasure
solely
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
slavers
bound
to
that
island
the
late
serious
difficulties
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
respecting
the
right
of
search
now
so
happily
terminated
could
never
have
arisen
if
cuba
had
not
afforded
a
market
for
slaves
as
long
as
this
market
shall
remain
open
there
can
be
no
hope
for
the
civilization
of
benighted
africa
whilst
the
demand
for
slaves
continues
in
cuba
wars
will
be
waged
among
the
petty
and
barbarous
chiefs
in
africa
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
subjects
to
supply
this
trade
in
such
a
condition
of
affairs
it
is
impossible
that
the
light
of
civilization
and
religion
can
ever
penetrate
these
dark
abodes
it
has
been
made
known
to
the
world
by
my
predecessors
that
the
united
states
have
on
several
occasions
endeavored
to
acquire
cuba
from
spain
by
honorable
negotiation
if
this
were
accomplished
the
last
relic
of
the
african
slave
trade
would
instantly
disappear
we
would
not
if
we
could
acquire
cuba
in
any
other
manner
this
is
due
to
our
national
character
all
the
territory
which
we
have
acquired
since
the
origin
of
the
government
has
been
by
fair
purchase
from
france
spain
and
mexico
or
by
the
free
and
voluntary
act
of
the
independent
state
of
texas
in
blending
her
destinies
with
our
own
this
course
we
shall
ever
pursue
unless
circumstances
should
occur
which
we
do
not
now
anticipate
rendering
a
departure
from
it
clearly
justifiable
under
the
imperative
and
overruling
law
of
selfpreservation
the
island
of
cuba
from
its
geographical
position
commands
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
the
immense
and
annually
increasing
trade
foreign
and
coastwise
from
the
valley
of
that
noble
river
now
embracing
half
the
sovereign
states
of
the
union
with
that
island
under
the
dominion
of
a
distant
foreign
power
this
trade
of
vital
importance
to
these
s
tates
is
exposed
to
the
danger
of
being
destroyed
in
time
of
war
and
it
has
hitherto
been
subjected
to
perpetual
injury
and
annoyance
in
time
of
peace
our
relations
with
spain
which
ought
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
must
always
be
placed
in
jeopardy
whilst
the
existing
colonial
government
over
the
island
shall
remain
in
its
present
condition
whilst
the
possession
of
the
island
would
be
of
vast
importance
to
the
united
states
its
value
to
spain
is
comparatively
unimportant
such
was
the
relative
situation
of
the
parties
when
the
great
napoleon
transferred
louisiana
to
the
united
states
jealous
as
he
ever
was
of
the
national
honor
and
interests
of
france
no
person
throughout
the
world
has
imputed
blame
to
him
for
accepting
a
pecuniary
equivalent
for
this
cession
the
publicity
which
has
been
given
to
our
former
negotiations
upon
this
subject
and
the
large
appropriation
which
may
be
required
to
effect
the
purpose
render
it
expedient
before
making
another
attempt
to
renew
the
negotiation
that
i
should
lay
the
whole
subject
before
congress
this
is
especially
necessary
as
it
may
become
indispensable
to
success
that
i
should
be
intrusted
with
the
means
of
making
an
advance
to
the
spanish
government
immediately
after
the
signing
of
the
treaty
without
awaiting
the
ratification
of
it
by
the
senate
i
am
encouraged
to
make
this
suggestion
by
the
example
of
mr
jefferson
previous
to
the
purchase
of
louisiana
from
france
and
by
that
of
mr
polk
in
view
of
the
acquisition
of
territory
from
mexico
i
refer
the
whole
subject
to
congress
and
commend
it
to
their
careful
consideration
i
repeat
the
recommendation
made
in
my
message
of
december
last
in
favor
of
an
appropriation
to
be
paid
to
the
spanish
government
for
the
purpose
of
distribution
among
the
claimants
in
the
amistad
case
president
polk
first
made
a
similar
recommendation
in
december
and
it
was
repeated
by
my
immediate
predecessor
in
december
i
entertain
no
doubt
that
indemnity
is
fairly
due
to
these
claimants
under
our
treaty
with
spain
of
october
and
whilst
demanding
justice
we
ought
to
do
justice
an
appropriation
promptly
made
for
this
purpose
could
not
fail
to
exert
a
favorable
influence
on
our
negotiations
with
spain
our
position
in
relation
to
the
independent
states
south
of
us
on
this
continent
and
especially
those
within
the
limits
of
north
america
is
of
a
peculiar
character
the
northern
boundary
of
mexico
is
coincident
with
our
own
southern
boundary
from
ocean
to
ocean
and
we
must
necessarily
feel
a
deep
interest
in
all
that
concerns
the
wellbeing
and
the
fate
of
so
near
a
neighbor
we
have
always
cherished
the
kindest
wishes
for
the
success
of
that
republic
and
have
indulged
the
hope
that
it
might
at
last
after
all
its
trials
enjoy
peace
and
prosperity
under
a
free
and
stable
government
we
have
never
hitherto
interfered
directly
or
indirectly
with
its
internal
affairs
and
it
is
a
duty
which
we
owe
to
ourselves
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
territory
against
the
hostile
interference
of
any
other
power
our
geographical
position
our
direct
interest
in
all
that
concerns
mexico
and
our
wellsettled
policy
in
regard
to
the
north
american
continent
render
this
an
indispensable
duty
mexico
has
been
in
a
state
of
constant
revolution
almost
ever
since
it
achieved
its
independence
one
military
leader
after
another
has
usurped
the
government
in
rapid
succession
and
the
various
constitutions
from
time
to
time
adopted
have
been
set
at
naught
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
proclaimed
the
successive
governments
have
afforded
no
adequate
protection
either
to
mexican
citizens
or
foreign
residents
against
lawless
violence
heretofore
a
seizure
of
the
capital
by
a
military
chieftain
has
been
generally
followed
by
at
least
the
nominal
submission
of
the
country
to
his
rule
for
a
brief
period
but
not
so
at
the
present
crisis
of
mexican
affairs
a
civil
war
has
been
raging
for
some
time
throughout
the
republic
between
the
central
government
at
the
city
of
mexico
which
has
endeavored
to
subvert
the
constitution
last
framed
by
military
power
and
those
who
maintain
the
authority
of
that
constitution
the
antagonist
parties
each
hold
possession
of
different
states
of
the
republic
and
the
fortunes
of
the
war
are
constantly
changing
meanwhile
the
most
reprehensible
means
have
been
employed
by
both
parties
to
extort
money
from
foreigners
as
well
as
natives
to
carry
on
this
ruinous
contest
the
truth
is
that
this
fine
country
blessed
with
a
productive
soil
and
a
benign
climate
has
been
reduced
by
civil
dissension
to
a
condition
of
almost
hopeless
anarchy
and
imbecility
it
would
be
vain
for
this
government
to
attempt
to
enforce
payment
in
money
of
the
claims
of
american
citizens
now
amounting
to
more
than
against
mexico
because
she
is
destitute
of
all
pecuniary
means
to
satisfy
these
demands
our
late
minister
was
furnished
with
ample
powers
and
instructions
for
the
adjustment
of
all
pending
questions
with
the
central
government
of
mexico
and
he
performed
his
duty
with
zeal
and
ability
the
claims
of
our
citizens
some
of
them
arising
out
of
the
violation
of
an
express
provision
of
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
and
others
from
gross
injuries
to
persons
as
well
as
property
have
remained
unredressed
and
even
unnoticed
remonstrances
against
these
grievances
have
been
addressed
without
effect
to
that
government
meantime
in
various
parts
of
the
republic
instances
have
been
numerous
of
the
murder
imprisonment
and
plunder
of
our
citizens
by
different
parties
claiming
and
exercising
a
local
jurisdiction
but
the
central
government
although
repeatedly
urged
thereto
have
made
no
effort
either
to
punish
the
authors
of
these
outrages
or
to
prevent
their
recurrence
no
american
citizen
can
now
visit
mexico
on
lawful
business
without
imminent
danger
to
his
person
and
property
there
is
no
adequate
protection
to
either
and
in
this
respect
our
treaty
with
that
republic
is
almost
a
dead
letter
this
state
of
affairs
was
brought
to
a
crisis
in
may
last
by
the
promulgation
of
a
decree
levying
a
contribution
pro
rata
upon
all
the
capital
in
the
republic
between
certain
specified
amounts
whether
held
by
mexicans
or
foreigners
mr
forsyth
regarding
this
decree
in
the
light
of
a
forced
loan
formally
protested
against
its
application
to
his
countrymen
and
advised
them
not
to
pay
the
contribution
but
to
suffer
it
to
be
forcibly
exacted
acting
upon
this
advice
an
american
citizen
refused
to
pay
the
contribution
and
his
property
was
seized
by
armed
men
to
satisfy
the
amount
not
content
with
this
the
government
proceeded
still
further
and
issued
a
decree
banishing
him
from
the
country
our
minister
immediately
notified
them
that
if
this
decree
should
be
carried
into
execution
he
would
feel
it
to
be
his
duty
to
adopt
the
most
decided
measures
that
belong
to
the
powers
and
obligations
of
the
representative
office
notwithstanding
this
warning
the
banishment
was
enforced
and
mr
forsyth
promptly
announced
to
the
government
the
suspension
of
the
political
relations
of
his
legation
with
them
until
the
pleasure
of
his
own
government
should
be
ascertained
this
government
did
not
regard
the
contribution
imposed
by
the
decree
of
the
th
may
last
to
be
in
strictness
a
forced
loan
and
as
such
prohibited
by
the
tenth
article
of
the
treaty
of
between
great
britain
and
mexico
to
the
benefits
of
which
american
citizens
are
entitled
by
treaty
yet
the
imposition
of
the
contribution
upon
foreigners
was
considered
an
unjust
and
oppressive
measure
besides
internal
factions
in
other
parts
of
the
republic
were
at
the
same
time
levying
similar
exactions
upon
the
property
of
our
citizens
and
interrupting
their
commerce
there
had
been
an
entire
failure
on
the
part
of
our
minister
to
secure
redress
for
the
wrongs
which
our
citizens
had
endured
notwithstanding
his
persevering
efforts
and
from
the
temper
manifested
by
the
mexican
government
he
had
repeatedly
assured
us
that
no
favorable
change
could
be
expected
until
the
united
states
should
give
striking
evidence
of
their
will
and
power
to
protect
their
citizens
and
that
severe
chastening
is
the
only
earthly
remedy
for
our
grievances
from
this
statement
of
facts
it
would
have
been
worse
than
idle
to
direct
mr
forsyth
to
retrace
his
steps
and
resume
diplomatic
relations
with
that
government
and
it
was
therefore
deemed
proper
to
sanction
his
withdrawal
of
the
legation
from
the
city
of
mexico
abundant
cause
now
undoubtedly
exists
for
a
resort
to
hostilities
against
the
government
still
holding
possession
of
the
capital
should
they
succeed
in
subduing
the
constitutional
forces
all
reasonable
hope
will
then
have
expired
of
a
peaceful
settlement
of
our
difficulties
on
the
other
hand
should
the
constitutional
party
prevail
and
their
authority
be
established
over
the
republic
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
they
will
be
animated
by
a
less
unfriendly
spirit
and
may
grant
that
redress
to
american
citizens
which
justice
requires
so
far
as
they
may
possess
the
means
but
for
this
expectation
i
should
at
once
have
recommended
to
congress
to
grant
the
necessary
power
to
the
president
to
take
possession
of
a
sufficient
portion
of
the
remote
and
unsettled
territory
of
mexico
to
be
held
in
pledge
until
our
injuries
shall
be
redressed
and
our
just
demands
be
satisfied
we
have
already
exhausted
every
milder
means
of
obtaining
justice
in
such
a
case
this
remedy
of
reprisals
is
recognized
by
the
law
of
nations
not
only
as
just
in
itself
but
as
a
means
of
preventing
actual
war
but
there
is
another
view
of
our
relations
with
mexico
arising
from
the
unhappy
condition
of
affairs
along
our
southwestern
frontier
which
demands
immediate
action
in
that
remote
region
where
there
are
but
few
white
inhabitants
large
bands
of
hostile
and
predatory
indians
roam
promiscuously
over
the
mexican
states
of
chihuahua
and
sonora
and
our
adjoining
territories
the
local
governments
of
these
states
are
perfectly
helpless
and
are
kept
in
a
state
of
constant
alarm
by
the
indians
they
have
not
the
power
if
they
possessed
the
will
even
to
restrain
lawless
m
exicans
from
passing
the
border
and
committing
depredations
on
our
remote
settlers
a
state
of
anarchy
and
violence
prevails
throughout
that
distant
frontier
the
laws
are
a
dead
letter
and
life
and
property
wholly
insecure
for
this
reason
the
settlement
of
arizona
is
arrested
whilst
it
is
of
great
importance
that
a
chain
of
inhabitants
should
extend
all
along
its
southern
border
sufficient
for
their
own
protection
and
that
of
the
united
states
mail
passing
to
and
from
california
wellfounded
apprehensions
are
now
entertained
that
the
indians
and
wandering
mexicans
equally
lawless
may
break
up
the
important
stage
and
postal
communication
recently
established
between
our
atlantic
and
pacific
possessions
this
passes
very
near
to
the
mexican
boundary
throughout
the
whole
length
of
arizona
i
can
imagine
no
possible
remedy
for
these
evils
and
no
mode
of
restoring
law
and
order
on
that
remote
and
unsettled
frontier
but
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
assume
a
temporary
protectorate
over
the
northern
portions
of
chihuahua
and
sonora
and
to
establish
military
posts
within
the
same
and
this
i
earnestly
recommend
to
congress
this
protection
may
be
withdrawn
as
soon
as
local
governments
shall
be
established
in
these
mexican
states
capable
of
performing
their
duties
to
the
united
states
restraining
the
lawless
and
preserving
peace
along
the
border
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
measure
will
be
viewed
in
a
friendly
spirit
by
the
governments
and
people
of
chihuahua
and
sonora
as
it
will
prove
equally
effectual
for
the
protection
of
their
citizens
on
that
remote
and
lawless
frontier
as
for
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
in
this
connection
permit
me
to
recall
your
attention
to
the
condition
of
arizona
the
population
of
that
territory
numbering
as
is
alleged
more
than
souls
are
practically
without
a
government
without
laws
and
without
any
regular
administration
of
justice
murder
and
other
crimes
are
committed
with
impunity
this
state
of
things
calls
loudly
for
redress
and
i
therefore
repeat
my
recommendation
for
the
establishment
of
a
territorial
government
over
arizona
the
political
condition
of
the
narrow
isthmus
of
central
america
through
which
transit
routes
pass
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
presents
a
subject
of
deep
interest
to
all
commercial
nations
it
is
over
these
transits
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
trade
and
travel
between
the
european
and
asiatic
continents
is
destined
to
pass
to
the
united
states
these
routes
are
of
incalculable
importance
as
a
means
of
communication
between
their
atlantic
and
pacific
possessions
the
latter
now
extend
throughout
seventeen
degrees
of
latitude
on
the
pacific
coast
embracing
the
important
state
of
california
and
the
flourishing
territories
of
oregon
and
washington
all
commercial
nations
therefore
have
a
deep
and
direct
interest
that
these
communications
shall
be
rendered
secure
from
interruption
if
an
arm
of
the
sea
connecting
the
two
oceans
penetrated
through
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
it
could
not
be
pretended
that
these
states
would
have
the
right
to
arrest
or
retard
its
navigation
to
the
injury
of
other
nations
the
transit
by
land
over
this
narrow
isthmus
occupies
nearly
the
same
position
it
is
a
highway
in
which
they
themselves
have
little
interest
when
compared
with
the
vast
interests
of
the
rest
of
the
world
whilst
their
rights
of
sovereignty
ought
to
be
respected
it
is
the
duty
of
other
nations
to
require
that
this
important
passage
shall
not
be
interrupted
by
the
civil
wars
and
revolutionary
outbreaks
which
have
so
frequently
occurred
in
that
region
the
stake
is
too
important
to
be
left
at
the
mercy
of
rival
companies
claiming
to
hold
conflicting
contracts
with
nicaragua
the
commerce
of
other
nations
is
not
to
stand
still
and
await
the
adjustment
of
such
petty
controversies
the
government
of
the
united
states
expect
no
more
than
this
and
they
will
not
be
satisfied
with
less
they
would
not
if
they
could
derive
any
advantage
from
the
nicaragua
transit
not
common
to
the
rest
of
the
world
its
neutrality
and
protection
for
the
common
use
of
all
nations
is
their
only
object
they
have
no
objection
that
nicaragua
shall
demand
and
receive
a
fair
compensation
from
the
companies
and
individuals
who
may
traverse
the
route
but
they
insist
that
it
shall
never
hereafter
be
closed
by
an
arbitrary
decree
of
that
government
if
disputes
arise
between
it
and
those
with
whom
they
may
have
entered
into
contracts
these
must
be
adjusted
by
some
fair
tribunal
provided
for
the
purpose
and
the
route
must
not
be
closed
pending
the
controversy
this
is
our
whole
policy
and
it
can
not
fail
to
be
acceptable
to
other
nations
all
these
difficulties
might
be
avoided
if
consistently
with
the
good
faith
of
nicaragua
the
use
of
this
transit
could
be
thrown
open
to
general
competition
providing
at
the
same
time
for
the
payment
of
a
reasonable
rate
to
the
nicaraguan
government
on
passengers
and
freight
in
august
the
accessory
transit
company
made
its
first
interoceanic
trip
over
the
nicaraguan
route
and
continued
in
successful
operation
with
great
advantage
to
the
public
until
the
th
february
when
it
was
closed
and
the
grant
to
this
company
as
well
as
its
charter
were
summarily
and
arbitrarily
revoked
by
the
government
of
president
rivas
previous
to
this
date
however
in
serious
disputes
concerning
the
settlement
of
their
accounts
had
arisen
between
the
company
and
the
government
threatening
the
interruption
of
the
route
at
any
moment
these
the
united
states
in
vain
endeavored
to
compose
it
would
be
useless
to
narrate
the
various
proceedings
which
took
place
between
the
parties
up
till
the
time
when
the
transit
was
discontinued
suffice
it
to
say
that
since
february
it
has
remained
closed
greatly
to
the
prejudice
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
since
that
time
the
competition
has
ceased
between
the
rival
routes
of
panama
and
nicaragua
and
in
consequence
thereof
an
unjust
and
unreasonable
amount
has
been
exacted
from
our
citizens
for
their
passage
to
and
from
california
a
treaty
was
signed
on
the
th
day
of
november
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
minister
of
nicaragua
under
the
stipulations
of
which
the
use
and
protection
of
the
transit
route
would
have
been
secured
not
only
to
the
united
states
but
equally
to
all
other
nations
how
and
on
what
pretext
this
treaty
has
failed
to
receive
the
ratification
of
the
nicaraguan
government
will
appear
by
the
papers
herewith
communicated
from
the
state
department
the
principal
objection
seems
to
have
been
to
the
provision
authorizing
the
united
states
to
employ
force
to
keep
the
route
open
in
case
nicaragua
should
fail
to
perform
her
duty
in
this
respect
from
the
feebleness
of
that
republic
its
frequent
changes
of
government
and
its
constant
internal
dissensions
this
had
become
a
most
important
stipulation
and
one
essentially
necessary
not
only
for
the
security
of
the
route
but
for
the
safety
of
american
citizens
passing
and
repassing
to
and
from
our
pacific
possessions
were
such
a
stipulation
embraced
in
a
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
nicaragua
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
would
of
itself
most
probably
prevent
hostile
parties
from
committing
aggressions
on
the
route
and
render
our
actual
interference
for
its
protection
unnecessary
the
executive
government
of
this
country
in
its
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
is
limited
to
the
employment
of
diplomacy
alone
when
this
fails
it
can
proceed
no
further
it
can
not
legitimately
resort
to
force
without
the
direct
authority
of
congress
except
in
resisting
and
repelling
hostile
attacks
it
would
have
no
authority
to
enter
the
territories
of
nicaragua
even
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
the
transit
and
protect
the
lives
and
property
of
our
own
citizens
on
their
passage
it
is
true
that
on
a
sudden
emergency
of
this
character
the
president
would
direct
any
armed
force
in
the
vicinity
to
march
to
their
relief
but
in
doing
this
he
would
act
upon
his
own
responsibility
under
these
circumstances
i
earnestly
recommend
to
congress
the
passage
of
an
act
authorizing
the
president
under
such
restrictions
as
they
may
deem
proper
to
employ
the
land
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
in
preventing
the
transit
from
being
obstructed
or
closed
by
lawless
violence
and
in
protecting
the
lives
and
property
of
american
citizens
traveling
thereupon
requiring
at
the
same
time
that
these
forces
shall
be
withdrawn
the
moment
the
danger
shall
have
passed
away
without
such
a
provision
our
citizens
will
be
constantly
exposed
to
interruption
in
their
progress
and
to
lawless
violence
a
similar
necessity
exists
for
the
passage
of
such
an
act
for
the
protection
of
the
panama
and
tehuantepec
routes
in
reference
to
the
panama
route
the
united
states
by
their
existing
treaty
with
new
granada
expressly
guarantee
the
neutrality
of
the
isthmus
with
the
view
that
the
free
transit
from
the
one
to
the
other
sea
may
not
be
interrupted
or
embarrassed
in
any
future
time
while
this
treaty
exists
in
regard
to
the
tehuantepec
route
which
has
been
recently
opened
under
the
most
favorable
auspices
our
treaty
with
mexico
of
the
th
december
secures
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
a
right
of
transit
over
it
for
their
persons
and
merchandise
and
stipulates
that
neither
government
shall
interpose
any
obstacle
thereto
it
also
concedes
to
the
united
states
the
right
to
transport
across
the
isthmus
in
closed
bags
the
mails
of
the
united
states
not
intended
for
distribution
along
the
line
of
the
communication
also
the
effects
of
the
united
states
government
and
its
citizens
which
may
be
intended
for
transit
and
not
for
distribution
on
the
isthmus
free
of
customhouse
or
other
charges
by
the
mexican
government
these
treaty
stipulations
with
new
granada
and
mexico
in
addition
to
the
considerations
applicable
to
the
nicaragua
route
seem
to
require
legislation
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
them
into
effect
the
injuries
which
have
been
inflicted
upon
our
citizens
in
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
during
the
last
two
or
three
years
have
received
the
prompt
attention
of
this
gove
rnment
some
of
these
injuries
were
of
the
most
aggravated
character
the
transaction
at
virgin
bay
in
april
when
a
company
of
unarmed
americans
who
were
in
no
way
connected
with
any
belligerent
conduct
or
party
were
fired
upon
by
the
troops
of
costa
rica
and
numbers
of
them
killed
and
wounded
was
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
congress
by
my
predecessor
soon
after
its
occurrence
and
was
also
presented
to
the
government
of
costa
rica
for
that
immediate
investigation
and
redress
which
the
nature
of
the
case
demanded
a
similar
course
was
pursued
with
reference
to
other
outrages
in
these
countries
some
of
which
were
hardly
less
aggravated
in
their
character
than
the
transaction
at
virgin
bay
at
the
time
however
when
our
present
minister
to
nicaragua
was
appointed
in
december
no
redress
had
been
obtained
for
any
of
these
wrongs
and
no
reply
even
had
been
received
to
the
demands
which
had
been
made
by
this
government
upon
that
of
costa
rica
more
than
a
year
before
our
minister
was
instructed
therefore
to
lose
no
time
in
expressing
to
those
governments
the
deep
regret
with
which
the
president
had
witnessed
this
inattention
to
the
just
claims
of
the
united
states
and
in
demanding
their
prompt
and
satisfactory
adjustment
unless
this
demand
shall
be
complied
with
at
an
early
day
it
will
only
remain
for
this
government
to
adopt
such
other
measures
as
may
be
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
for
itself
that
justice
which
it
has
in
vain
attempted
to
secure
by
peaceful
means
from
the
governments
of
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
while
it
has
shown
and
will
continue
to
show
the
most
sincere
regard
for
the
rights
and
honor
of
these
republics
it
can
not
permit
this
regard
to
be
met
by
an
utter
neglect
on
their
part
of
what
is
due
to
the
government
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
new
granada
we
have
longstanding
causes
of
complaint
arising
out
of
the
unsatisfied
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
that
republic
and
to
these
have
been
more
recently
added
the
outrages
committed
upon
our
citizens
at
panama
in
april
a
treaty
for
the
adjustment
of
these
difficulties
was
concluded
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
minister
of
new
granada
in
september
which
contained
just
and
acceptable
provisions
for
that
purpose
this
treaty
was
transmitted
to
bogota
and
was
ratified
by
the
government
of
new
granada
but
with
certain
amendments
it
was
not
however
returned
to
this
city
until
after
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
the
senate
it
will
be
immediately
transmitted
to
that
body
for
their
advice
and
consent
and
should
this
be
obtained
it
will
remove
all
our
existing
causes
of
complaint
against
new
granada
on
the
subject
of
claims
questions
have
arisen
between
the
two
governments
as
to
the
right
of
new
granada
to
levy
a
tonnage
duty
upon
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
in
its
ports
of
the
isthmus
and
to
levy
a
passenger
tax
upon
our
citizens
arriving
in
that
country
whether
with
a
design
to
remain
there
or
to
pass
from
ocean
to
ocean
by
the
transit
route
and
also
a
tax
upon
the
mail
of
the
united
states
transported
over
the
panama
railroad
the
government
of
new
granada
has
been
informed
that
the
united
states
would
consider
the
collection
of
either
of
these
taxes
as
an
act
in
violation
of
the
treaty
between
the
two
countries
and
as
such
would
be
resisted
by
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
we
are
prepared
to
discuss
these
questions
in
a
spirit
of
amity
and
justice
and
with
a
sincere
desire
to
adjust
them
in
a
satisfactory
manner
a
negotiation
for
that
purpose
has
already
been
commenced
no
effort
has
recently
been
made
to
collect
these
taxes
nor
is
any
anticipated
under
present
circumstances
with
the
empire
of
brazil
our
relations
are
of
the
most
friendly
character
the
productions
of
the
two
countries
and
especially
those
of
an
agricultural
nature
are
such
as
to
invite
extensive
mutual
exchanges
a
large
quantity
of
american
flour
is
consumed
in
brazil
whilst
more
than
treble
the
amount
in
value
of
brazilian
coffee
is
consumed
in
the
united
states
whilst
this
is
the
case
a
heavy
duty
has
been
levied
until
very
recently
upon
the
importation
of
american
flour
into
brazil
i
am
gratified
however
to
be
able
to
inform
you
that
in
september
last
this
has
been
reduced
from
to
about
cents
per
barrel
and
the
duties
on
other
articles
of
our
production
have
been
diminished
in
nearly
the
same
proportion
i
regret
to
state
that
the
government
of
brazil
still
continues
to
levy
an
export
duty
of
about
per
cent
on
coffee
notwithstanding
this
article
is
admitted
free
from
duty
in
the
united
states
this
is
a
heavy
charge
upon
the
consumers
of
coffee
in
our
country
as
we
purchase
half
of
the
entire
surplus
crop
of
that
article
raised
in
brazil
our
minister
under
instructions
will
reiterate
his
efforts
to
have
this
export
duty
removed
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
enlightened
government
of
the
emperor
will
adopt
this
wise
just
and
equal
policy
in
that
event
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
commerce
between
the
two
countries
will
greatly
increase
much
to
the
advantage
of
both
the
claims
of
our
citizens
against
the
government
of
brazil
are
not
in
the
aggregate
of
very
large
amount
but
some
of
these
rest
upon
plain
principles
of
justice
and
their
settlement
ought
not
to
be
longer
delayed
a
renewed
and
earnest
and
i
trust
a
successful
effort
will
be
made
by
our
minister
to
procure
their
final
adjustment
on
the
d
of
june
last
congress
passed
a
joint
resolution
authorizing
the
president
to
adopt
such
measures
and
use
such
force
as
in
his
judgment
may
be
necessary
and
advisable
for
the
purpose
of
the
differences
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
paraguay
in
connection
with
the
attack
on
the
united
states
steamer
water
witch
and
with
other
measures
referred
to
in
his
annual
message
and
on
the
th
of
july
following
they
made
an
appropriation
to
defray
the
expenses
and
compensation
of
a
commissioner
to
that
republic
should
the
president
deem
it
proper
to
make
such
all
appointment
in
compliance
with
these
enactments
i
have
appointed
a
commissioner
who
has
proceeded
to
paraguay
with
full
powers
and
instructions
to
settle
these
differences
in
an
amicable
and
peaceful
manner
if
this
be
practicable
his
experience
and
discretion
justify
the
hope
that
he
may
prove
successful
in
convincing
the
paraguayan
government
that
it
is
due
both
to
honor
and
justice
that
they
should
voluntarily
and
promptly
make
atonement
for
the
wrongs
which
they
have
committed
against
the
united
states
and
indemnify
our
injured
citizens
whom
they
have
forcibly
despoiled
of
their
property
should
our
commissioner
prove
unsuccessful
after
a
sincere
and
earnest
effort
to
accomplish
the
object
of
his
mission
then
no
alternative
will
remain
but
the
employment
of
force
to
obtain
just
satisfaction
from
paraguay
in
view
of
this
contingency
the
secretary
of
the
navy
under
my
direction
has
fitted
out
and
dispatched
a
naval
force
to
rendezvous
near
buenos
ayres
which
it
is
believed
will
prove
sufficient
for
the
occasion
it
is
my
earnest
desire
however
that
it
may
not
be
found
necessary
to
resort
to
this
last
alternative
when
congress
met
in
december
last
the
business
of
the
country
had
just
been
crushed
by
one
of
those
periodical
revulsions
which
are
the
inevitable
consequence
of
our
unsound
and
extravagant
system
of
bank
credits
and
inflated
currency
with
all
the
elements
of
national
wealth
in
abundance
our
manufactures
were
suspended
our
useful
public
and
private
enterprises
were
arrested
and
thousands
of
laborers
were
deprived
of
employment
and
reduced
to
want
universal
distress
prevailed
among
the
commercial
manufacturing
and
mechanical
classes
this
revulsion
was
felt
the
more
severely
in
the
united
states
because
similar
causes
had
produced
the
like
deplorable
effects
throughout
the
commercial
nations
of
europe
all
were
experiencing
sad
reverses
at
the
same
moment
our
manufacturers
everywhere
suffered
severely
not
because
of
the
recent
reduction
in
the
tariff
of
duties
on
imports
but
because
there
was
no
demand
at
any
price
for
their
productions
the
people
were
obliged
to
restrict
themselves
in
their
purchases
to
articles
of
prime
necessity
in
the
general
prostration
of
business
the
iron
manufacturers
in
different
states
probably
suffered
more
than
any
other
class
and
much
destitution
was
the
inevitable
consequence
among
the
great
number
of
workmen
who
had
been
employed
in
this
useful
branch
of
industry
there
could
be
no
supply
where
there
was
no
demand
to
present
an
example
there
could
be
no
demand
for
railroad
iron
after
our
magnificent
system
of
railroads
extending
its
benefits
to
every
portion
of
the
union
had
been
brought
to
a
dead
pause
the
same
consequences
have
resulted
from
similar
causes
to
many
other
branches
of
useful
manufactures
it
is
selfevident
that
where
there
is
no
ability
to
purchase
manufactured
articles
these
can
not
be
sold
and
consequently
must
cease
to
be
produced
no
government
and
especially
a
government
of
such
limited
powers
as
that
of
the
united
states
could
have
prevented
the
late
revulsion
the
whole
commercial
world
seemed
for
years
to
have
been
rushing
to
this
catastrophe
the
same
ruinous
consequences
would
have
followed
in
the
united
states
whether
the
duties
upon
foreign
imports
had
remained
as
they
were
under
the
tariff
of
or
had
been
raised
to
a
much
higher
standard
the
tariff
of
had
no
agency
in
the
result
the
general
causes
existing
throughout
the
world
could
not
have
been
controlled
by
the
legislation
of
any
particular
country
the
periodical
revulsions
which
have
existed
in
our
past
history
must
continue
to
return
at
intervals
so
long
as
our
present
unbounded
system
of
bank
credits
shall
prevail
they
will
however
probably
be
the
less
severe
in
future
because
it
is
not
to
be
expected
at
least
for
many
years
to
come
that
the
commercial
nations
of
europe
with
whose
interests
our
own
are
so
materially
involved
will
expose
themselves
to
similar
calamities
but
this
subject
was
treated
so
much
at
large
in
my
last
annual
message
that
i
shall
not
now
pursue
it
further
still
i
respect
fully
renew
the
recommendation
in
favor
of
the
passage
of
a
uniform
bankrupt
law
applicable
to
banking
institutions
this
is
all
the
direct
power
over
the
subject
which
i
believe
the
federal
government
possesses
such
a
law
would
mitigate
though
it
might
not
prevent
the
evil
the
instinct
of
selfpreservation
might
produce
a
wholesome
restraint
upon
their
banking
business
if
they
knew
in
advance
that
a
suspension
of
specie
payments
would
inevitably
produce
their
civil
death
but
the
effects
of
the
revulsion
are
now
slowly
but
surely
passing
away
the
energy
and
enterprise
of
our
citizens
with
our
unbounded
resources
will
within
the
period
of
another
year
restore
a
state
of
wholesome
industry
and
trade
capital
has
again
accumulated
in
our
large
cities
the
rate
of
interest
is
there
very
low
confidence
is
gradually
reviving
and
so
soon
as
it
is
discovered
that
this
capital
can
be
profitably
employed
in
commercial
and
manufacturing
enterprises
and
in
the
construction
of
railroads
and
other
works
of
public
and
private
improvement
prosperity
will
again
smile
throughout
the
land
it
is
vain
however
to
disguise
the
fact
from
ourselves
that
a
speculative
inflation
of
our
currency
without
a
corresponding
inflation
in
other
countries
whose
manufactures
come
into
competition
with
our
own
must
ever
produce
disastrous
results
to
our
domestic
manufactures
no
tariff
short
of
absolute
prohibition
can
prevent
these
evil
consequences
in
connection
with
this
subject
it
is
proper
to
refer
to
our
financial
condition
the
same
causes
which
have
produced
pecuniary
distress
throughout
the
country
have
so
reduced
the
amount
of
imports
from
foreign
countries
that
the
revenue
has
proved
inadequate
to
meet
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
government
to
supply
the
deficiency
congress
by
the
act
of
december
authorized
the
issue
of
of
treasury
notes
and
this
proving
inadequate
they
authorized
by
the
act
of
june
a
loan
of
to
be
applied
to
the
payment
of
appropriations
made
by
law
no
statesman
would
advise
that
we
should
go
on
increasing
the
national
debt
to
meet
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
this
would
be
a
most
ruinous
policy
in
case
of
war
our
credit
must
be
our
chief
resource
at
least
for
the
first
year
and
this
would
be
greatly
impaired
by
having
contracted
a
large
debt
in
time
of
peace
it
is
our
true
policy
to
increase
our
revenue
so
as
to
equal
our
expenditures
it
would
be
ruinous
to
continue
to
borrow
besides
it
may
be
proper
to
observe
that
the
incidental
protection
thus
afforded
by
a
revenue
tariff
would
at
the
present
moment
to
some
extent
increase
the
confidence
of
the
manufacturing
interests
and
give
a
fresh
impulse
to
our
reviving
business
to
this
surely
no
person
will
object
in
regard
to
the
mode
of
assessing
and
collecting
duties
under
a
strictly
revenue
tariff
i
have
long
entertained
and
often
expressed
the
opinion
that
sound
policy
requires
this
should
be
done
by
specific
duties
in
cases
to
which
these
can
be
properly
applied
they
are
well
adapted
to
commodities
which
are
usually
sold
by
weight
or
by
measure
and
which
from
their
nature
are
of
equal
or
of
nearly
equal
value
such
for
example
are
the
articles
of
iron
of
different
classes
raw
sugar
and
foreign
wines
and
spirits
in
my
deliberate
judgment
specific
duties
are
the
best
if
not
the
only
means
of
securing
the
revenue
against
false
and
fraudulent
invoices
and
such
has
been
the
practice
adopted
for
this
purpose
by
other
commercial
nations
besides
specific
duties
would
afford
to
the
american
manufacturer
the
incidental
advantages
to
which
he
is
fairly
entitled
under
a
revenue
tariff
the
present
system
is
a
sliding
scale
to
his
disadvantage
under
it
when
prices
are
high
and
business
prosperous
the
duties
rise
in
amount
when
he
least
requires
their
aid
on
the
contrary
when
prices
fall
and
he
is
struggling
against
adversity
the
duties
are
diminished
in
the
same
proportion
greatly
to
his
injury
neither
would
there
be
danger
that
a
higher
rate
of
duty
than
that
intended
by
congress
could
be
levied
in
the
form
of
specific
duties
it
would
be
easy
to
ascertain
the
average
value
of
any
imported
article
for
a
series
of
years
and
instead
of
subjecting
it
to
an
ad
valorem
duty
at
a
certain
rate
per
centum
to
substitute
in
its
place
an
equivalent
specific
duty
by
such
an
arrangement
the
consumer
would
not
be
injured
it
is
true
he
might
have
to
pay
a
little
more
duty
on
a
given
article
in
one
year
but
if
so
he
would
pay
a
little
less
in
another
and
in
a
series
of
years
these
would
counterbalance
each
other
and
amount
to
the
same
thing
so
far
as
his
interest
is
concerned
this
inconvenience
would
be
trifling
when
contrasted
with
the
additional
security
thus
afforded
against
frauds
upon
the
revenue
in
which
every
consumer
is
directly
interested
i
have
thrown
out
these
suggestions
as
the
fruit
of
my
own
observation
to
which
congress
in
their
better
judgment
will
give
such
weight
as
they
may
justly
deserve
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
explain
in
detail
the
operations
of
that
department
of
the
government
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
from
all
sources
during
the
fiscal
year
ending

including
the

notes
authorized
by

amount

of
the
year
made
an
aggregate
for
the
service
of
the

of
the
public
expenditures
during
the
fiscal

ending

amounted
to
of
which
were
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
public

and
the
redemption
of

with
the
interest

including
onehalf
of

and
the
estimated

stated

of
which
were
applied
to

and
the

thereon
the

an
excess

placed
by

within
the
command
of
the
secretary
of

by
the

notes
redeemed
and
by
negotiating
the
balance
of
the
loan
authorized
by
the
act
of
june
to
the
extent
of
which
if
realized
during
the
present
fiscal
year
will
leave
a
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
day
of
july
of
the
estimated
receipts
during
the
next
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
which
with
the
aboveestimated
balance
of
make
an
aggregate
for
the
service
of
the
next
fiscal
year
of
the
estimated
expenditures
during
the

ending

are
which
leaves
a
deficit
of
estimated

compared
with
the
estimated
expenditures
for
that
year
commencing
on
july
of
in
addition
to
this
sum
the
postmastergeneral
will
require
from
the
treasury
for
the
service
of
the
postoffice
department
as
explained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
will
increase
the
estimated
deficit
on
june
to
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
this
estimated
deficiency
which
will
be
increased
by
such
appropriations
as
may
be
made
by
congress
not
estimated
for
in
the
report
of
the
treasury
department
as
well
as
to
provide
for
the
gradual
redemption
from
year
to
year
of
the
outstanding
treasury
notes
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
recommends
such
a
revision
of
the
present
tariff
as
will
raise
the
required
amount
after
what
i
have
already
said
i
need
scarcely
add
that
i
concur
in
the
opinion
expressed
in
his
reportthat
the
public
debt
should
not
be
increased
by
an
additional
loanand
would
therefore
strongly
urge
upon
congress
the
duty
of
making
at
their
present
session
the
necessary
provision
for
meeting
these
liabilities
the
public
debt
on
july
the
commencement
of
the
present
fiscal
year
was
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
year
the
sum
of
has
been
negotiated
of
the
loan
authorized
by
the
act
of
june
making
the
present
outstanding
public
debt
exclusive
of
treasury
notes
there
was
on
the
st
of
july
of
treasury
notes
issued
by
authority
of
the
act
of
december
unredeemed
the
sum
of
making
the
amount
of
actual
indebtedness
at
that
date
to
this
will
be
added
during
the
present
fiscal
year
this
being
the
remaining
half
of
the
loan
of
not
yet
negotiated
the
rapid
increase
of
the
public
debt
and
the
necessity
which
exists
for
a
modification
of
the
tariff
to
meet
even
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
ought
to
admonish
us
all
in
our
respective
spheres
of
duty
to
the
practice
of
rigid
economy
the
objects
of
expenditure
should
be
limited
in
number
as
far
as
this
may
be
practicable
and
the
appropriations
necessary
to
carry
them
into
effect
ought
to
be
disbursed
under
the
strictest
accountability
enlightened
economy
does
not
consist
in
the
refusal
to
appropriate
money
for
constitutional
purposes
essential
to
the
defense
progress
and
prosperity
of
the
republic
but
in
taking
care
that
none
of
this
money
shall
be
wasted
by
mismanagement
in
its
application
to
the
objects
designated
by
law
comparisons
between
the
annual
expenditure
at
the
present
time
and
what
it
was
ten
or
twenty
years
ago
are
altogether
fallacious
the
rapid
increase
of
our
country
in
extent
and
population
renders
a
corresponding
increase
of
expenditure
to
some
extent
unavoidable
this
is
constantly
creating
new
objects
of
expenditure
and
augmenting
the
amount
required
for
the
old
the
true
questions
then
are
have
these
objects
been
unnecessarily
multiplied
or
has
the
amount
expended
upon
any
or
all
of
them
been
larger
than
comports
with
due
economy
in
accordance
with
these
principles
the
heads
of
the
different
executive
departments
of
the
government
have
been
instructed
to
reduce
th
eir
estimates
for
the
next
fiscal
year
to
the
lowest
standard
consistent
with
the
efficiency
of
the
service
and
this
duty
they
have
performed
in
a
spirit
of
just
economy
the
estimates
of
the
treasury
war
navy
and
interior
departments
have
each
been
in
some
degree
reduced
and
unless
a
sudden
and
unforeseen
emergency
should
arise
it
is
not
anticipated
that
a
deficiency
will
exist
in
either
within
the
present
or
the
next
fiscal
year
the
postoffice
department
is
placed
in
a
peculiar
position
different
from
the
other
departments
and
to
this
i
shall
hereafter
refer
i
invite
congress
to
institute
a
rigid
scrutiny
to
ascertain
whether
the
expenses
in
all
the
departments
can
not
be
still
further
reduced
and
i
promise
them
all
the
aid
in
my
power
in
pursuing
the
investigation
i
transmit
herewith
the
reports
made
to
me
by
the
secretaries
of
war
of
the
navy
of
the
interior
and
of
the
postmastergeneral
they
each
contain
valuable
information
and
important
recommendations
to
which
i
invite
the
attention
of
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
i
took
occasion
to
recommend
the
immediate
construction
of
ten
small
steamers
of
light
draft
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
efficiency
of
the
navy
congress
responded
to
the
recommendation
by
authorizing
the
construction
of
eight
of
them
the
progress
which
has
been
made
in
executing
this
authority
is
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
i
concur
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
a
greater
number
of
this
class
of
vessels
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
in
a
more
efficient
manner
the
persons
and
property
of
american
citizens
on
the
high
seas
and
in
foreign
countries
as
well
as
in
guarding
more
effectually
our
own
coasts
i
accordingly
recommend
the
passage
of
an
act
for
this
purpose
the
suggestions
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
especially
those
in
regard
to
the
disposition
of
the
public
domain
the
pension
and
bountyland
system
the
policy
toward
the
indians
and
the
amendment
of
our
patent
laws
are
worthy
of
the
serious
consideration
of
congress
the
postoffice
department
occupies
a
position
very
different
from
that
of
the
other
departments
for
many
years
it
was
the
policy
of
the
government
to
render
this
a
selfsustaining
department
and
if
this
can
not
now
be
accomplished
in
the
present
condition
of
the
country
we
ought
to
make
as
near
an
approach
to
it
as
may
be
practicable
the
postmastergeneral
is
placed
in
a
most
embarrassing
position
by
the
existing
laws
he
is
obliged
to
carry
these
into
effect
he
has
no
other
alternative
he
finds
however
that
this
can
not
be
done
without
heavy
demands
upon
the
treasury
over
and
above
what
is
received
for
postage
and
these
have
been
progressively
increasing
from
year
to
year
until
they
amounted
for
the
last
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
to
more
than
whilst
it
is
estimated
that
for
the
present
fiscal
year
they
will
amount
to
these
sums
are
exclusive
of
the
annual
appropriation
of
for
compensation
for
the
mail
service
performed
for
the
two
houses
of
congress
and
the
other
departments
and
officers
of
the
government
in
the
transmission
of
free
matter
the
cause
of
these
large
deficits
is
mainly
attributable
to
the
increased
expense
of
transporting
the
mails
in
the
sum
paid
for
this
service
was
but
a
fraction
above
four
millions
and
a
quarter
since
that
year
it
has
annually
increased
until
in
it
has
reached
more
than
eight
millions
and
a
quarter
and
for
the
service
of
it
is
estimated
that
it
will
amount
to
more
than
the
receipts
of
the
postoffice
department
can
be
made
to
approach
or
to
equal
its
expenditure
only
by
means
of
the
legislation
of
congress
in
applying
any
remedy
care
should
be
taken
that
the
people
shall
not
be
deprived
of
the
advantages
which
they
are
fairly
entitled
to
enjoy
from
the
postoffice
department
the
principal
remedies
recommended
to
the
consideration
of
congress
by
the
postmastergeneral
are
to
restore
the
former
rate
of
postage
upon
single
letters
to
cents
to
substitute
for
the
franking
privilege
the
delivery
to
those
now
entitled
to
enjoy
it
of
postoffice
stamps
for
their
correspondence
and
to
direct
the
department
in
making
contracts
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
to
confine
itself
to
the
payment
of
the
sum
necessary
for
this
single
purpose
without
requiring
it
to
be
transported
in
post
coaches
or
carriages
of
any
particular
description
under
the
present
system
the
expense
to
the
government
is
greatly
increased
by
requiring
that
the
mail
shall
be
carried
in
such
vehicles
as
will
accommodate
passengers
this
will
be
done
without
pay
from
the
department
over
all
roads
where
the
travel
will
remunerate
the
contractors
these
recommendations
deserve
the
grave
consideration
of
congress
i
would
again
call
your
attention
to
the
construction
of
a
pacific
railroad
time
and
reflection
have
but
served
to
confirm
me
in
the
truth
and
justice
of
the
observations
which
i
made
on
this
subject
in
my
last
annual
message
to
which
i
beg
leave
respectfully
to
refer
it
is
freely
admitted
that
it
would
be
inexpedient
for
this
government
to
exercise
the
power
of
constructing
the
pacific
railroad
by
its
own
immediate
agents
such
a
policy
would
increase
the
patronage
of
the
executive
to
a
dangerous
extent
and
introduce
a
system
of
jobbing
and
corruption
which
no
vigilance
on
the
part
of
federal
officials
could
either
prevent
or
detect
this
can
only
be
done
by
the
keen
eye
and
active
and
careful
supervision
of
individual
and
private
interest
the
construction
of
this
road
ought
therefore
to
be
committed
to
companies
incorporated
by
the
states
or
other
agencies
whose
pecuniary
interests
would
be
directly
involved
congress
might
then
assist
them
in
the
work
by
grants
of
land
or
of
money
or
both
under
such
conditions
and
restrictions
as
would
secure
the
transportation
of
troops
and
munitions
of
war
free
from
any
charge
and
that
of
the
united
states
mail
at
a
fair
and
reasonable
price
the
progress
of
events
since
the
commencement
of
your
last
session
has
shown
how
soon
difficulties
disappear
before
a
firm
and
determined
resolution
at
that
time
such
a
road
was
deemed
by
wise
and
patriotic
men
to
be
a
visionary
project
the
great
distance
to
be
overcome
and
the
intervening
mountains
and
deserts
in
the
way
were
obstacles
which
in
the
opinion
of
many
could
not
be
surmounted
now
after
the
lapse
of
but
a
single
year
these
obstacles
it
has
been
discovered
are
far
less
formidable
than
they
were
supposed
to
be
and
mail
stages
with
passengers
now
pass
and
repass
regularly
twice
in
each
week
by
a
common
wagon
road
between
san
francisco
and
st
louis
and
memphis
in
less
than
twentyfive
days
the
service
has
been
as
regularly
performed
as
it
was
in
former
years
between
new
york
and
this
city
whilst
disclaiming
all
authority
to
appropriate
money
for
the
construction
of
this
road
except
that
derived
from
the
warmaking
power
of
the
constitution
there
are
important
collateral
considerations
urging
us
to
undertake
the
work
as
speedily
as
possible
the
first
and
most
momentous
of
these
is
that
such
a
road
would
be
a
powerful
bond
of
union
between
the
states
east
and
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
this
is
so
selfevident
as
to
require
no
illustration
but
again
in
a
commercial
point
of
view
i
consider
this
the
great
question
of
the
day
with
the
eastern
front
of
our
republic
stretching
along
the
atlantic
and
its
western
front
along
the
pacific
if
all
the
parts
should
be
united
by
a
safe
easy
and
rapid
intercommunication
we
must
necessarily
command
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
trade
both
of
europe
and
asia
our
recent
treaties
with
china
and
japan
will
open
these
rich
and
populous
empires
to
our
commerce
and
the
history
of
the
world
proves
that
the
nation
which
has
gained
possession
of
the
trade
with
eastern
asia
has
always
become
wealthy
and
powerful
the
peculiar
geographical
position
of
california
and
our
pacific
possessions
invites
american
capital
and
enterprise
into
this
fruitful
field
to
reap
the
rich
harvest
however
it
is
an
indispensable
prerequisite
that
we
shall
first
have
a
railroad
to
convey
and
circulate
its
products
throughout
every
portion
of
the
union
besides
such
a
railroad
through
our
temperate
latitude
which
would
not
be
impeded
by
the
frosts
and
snows
of
winter
nor
by
the
tropical
heats
of
summer
would
attract
to
itself
much
of
the
travel
and
the
trade
of
all
nations
passing
between
europe
and
asia
on
the
st
of
august
last
lieutenant
j
n
maffit
of
the
united
states
brig
dolphin
captured
the
slaver
echo
formerly
the
putnam
of
new
orleans
near
kay
verde
on
the
coast
of
cuba
with
more
than
african
negroes
on
board
the
prize
under
the
command
of
lieutenant
bradford
of
the
united
states
navy
arrived
at
charleston
on
the
th
august
when
the
negroes
in
number
were
delivered
into
the
custody
of
the
united
states
marshal
for
the
district
of
south
carolina
they
were
first
placed
in
castle
pinckney
and
afterwards
in
fort
sumter
for
safekeeping
and
were
detained
there
until
the
th
september
when
the
survivors
in
number
were
delivered
on
board
the
united
states
steamer
niagara
to
be
transported
to
the
coast
of
africa
under
the
charge
of
the
agent
of
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
the
d
march
in
addition
to
the
acts
prohibiting
the
slave
trade
under
the
second
section
of
this
act
the
president
is
authorized
to
make
such
regulations
and
arrangements
as
he
may
deem
expedient
for
the
safekeeping
support
and
removal
beyond
the
limits
of
the
united
states
of
all
such
negroes
mulattoes
or
persons
of
color
captured
by
vessels
of
the
united
states
as
may
be
delivered
to
the
marshal
of
the
district
into
which
they
are
brought
and
to
appoint
a
proper
person
or
persons
residing
upon
the
coast
of
africa
as
agent
or
agents
for
receiving
the
negroes
mulattoes
or
persons
of
color
delivered
from
on
board
vessels
seized
in
the
prosecution
of
the
slave
trade
by
commanders
of
united
states
armed
vessels
a
doubt
immediately
arose
as
to
the
true
construction
of
this
act
it
is
quite
clear
from
its
terms
that
the
president
was
aut
horized
to
provide
for
the
safekeeping
support
and
removal
of
these
negroes
up
till
the
time
of
their
delivery
to
the
agent
on
the
coast
of
africa
but
no
express
provision
was
made
for
their
protection
and
support
after
they
had
reached
the
place
of
their
destination
still
an
agent
was
to
be
pointed
to
receive
them
in
africa
and
it
could
not
have
been
supposed
that
congress
intended
he
should
desert
them
at
the
moment
they
were
received
and
turn
them
loose
on
that
inhospitable
coast
to
perish
for
want
of
food
or
to
become
again
the
victims
of
the
slave
trade
had
this
been
the
intention
of
congress
the
employment
of
an
agent
to
receive
them
who
is
required
to
reside
on
the
coast
was
unnecessary
and
they
might
have
been
landed
by
our
vessels
anywhere
in
africa
and
left
exposed
to
the
sufferings
and
the
fate
which
would
certainly
await
them
mr
monroe
in
his
special
message
of
december
at
the
first
session
after
the
act
was
passed
announced
to
congress
what
in
his
opinion
was
its
true
construction
he
believed
it
to
be
his
duty
under
it
to
follow
these
unfortunates
into
africa
and
make
provision
for
them
there
until
they
should
be
able
to
provide
for
themselves
in
communicating
this
interpretation
of
the
act
to
congress
he
stated
that
some
doubt
had
been
entertained
as
to
its
true
intent
and
meaning
and
he
submitted
the
question
to
them
so
that
they
might
should
it
be
deemed
advisable
amend
the
same
before
further
proceedings
are
had
under
it
nothing
was
done
by
congress
to
explain
the
act
and
mr
monroe
proceeded
to
carry
it
into
execution
according
to
his
own
interpretation
this
then
became
the
practical
construction
when
the
africans
from
on
board
the
echo
were
delivered
to
the
marshal
at
charleston
it
became
my
duty
to
consider
what
disposition
ought
to
be
made
of
them
under
the
law
for
many
reasons
it
was
expedient
to
remove
them
from
that
locality
as
speedily
as
possible
although
the
conduct
of
the
authorities
and
citizens
of
charleston
in
giving
countenance
to
the
execution
of
the
law
was
just
what
might
have
been
expected
from
their
high
character
yet
a
prolonged
continuance
of
africans
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
that
city
could
not
have
failed
to
become
a
source
of
inconvenience
and
anxiety
to
its
inhabitants
where
to
send
them
was
the
question
there
was
no
portion
of
the
coast
of
africa
to
which
they
could
be
removed
with
any
regard
to
humanity
except
to
liberia
under
these
circumstances
an
agreement
was
entered
into
with
the
colonization
society
on
the
th
of
september
last
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
transmitted
under
which
the
society
engaged
for
the
consideration
of
to
receive
these
africans
in
liberia
from
the
agent
of
the
united
states
and
furnish
them
during
the
period
of
one
year
thereafter
with
comfortable
shelter
clothing
provisions
and
medical
attendance
causing
the
children
to
receive
schooling
and
all
whether
children
or
adults
to
be
instructed
in
the
arts
of
civilized
life
suitable
to
their
condition
this
aggregate
of
was
based
upon
an
allowance
of
for
each
individual
and
as
there
has
been
considerable
mortality
among
them
and
may
be
more
before
they
reach
africa
the
society
have
agreed
in
an
equitable
spirit
to
make
such
a
deduction
from
the
amount
as
under
the
circumstances
may
appear
just
and
reasonable
this
can
not
be
fixed
until
we
shall
ascertain
the
actual
number
which
may
become
a
charge
to
the
society
it
was
also
distinctly
agreed
that
under
no
circumstances
shall
this
government
be
called
upon
for
any
additional
expenses
the
agents
of
the
society
manifested
a
laudable
desire
to
conform
to
the
wishes
of
the
government
throughout
the
transaction
they
assured
me
that
after
a
careful
calculation
they
would
be
required
to
expend
the
sum
of
on
each
individual
in
complying
with
the
agreement
and
they
would
have
nothing
left
to
remunerate
them
for
their
care
trouble
and
responsibility
at
all
events
i
could
make
no
better
arrangement
and
there
was
no
other
alternative
during
the
period
when
the
government
itself
through
its
own
agents
undertook
the
task
of
providing
for
captured
negroes
in
africa
the
cost
per
head
was
very
much
greater
there
having
been
no
outstanding
appropriation
applicable
to
this
purpose
i
could
not
advance
any
money
on
the
agreement
i
therefore
recommend
that
an
appropriation
may
be
made
of
the
amount
necessary
to
carry
it
into
effect
other
captures
of
a
similar
character
may
and
probably
will
be
made
by
our
naval
forces
and
i
earnestly
recommend
that
congress
may
amend
the
second
section
of
the
act
of
march
so
as
to
free
its
construction
from
the
ambiguity
which
has
so
long
existed
and
render
the
duty
of
the
president
plain
in
executing
its
provisions
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
regard
the
local
interests
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
the
residence
of
congress
and
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
we
can
not
fail
to
feel
a
deep
concern
in
its
welfare
this
is
heightened
by
the
high
character
and
the
peaceful
and
orderly
conduct
of
its
resident
inhabitants
i
can
not
conclude
without
performing
the
agreeable
duty
of
expressing
my
gratification
that
congress
so
kindly
responded
to
the
recommendation
of
my
last
annual
message
by
affording
me
sufficient
time
before
the
close
of
their
late
session
for
the
examination
of
all
the
bills
presented
to
me
for
approval
this
change
in
the
practice
of
congress
has
proved
to
be
a
wholesome
reform
it
exerted
a
beneficial
influence
on
the
transaction
of
legislative
business
and
elicited
the
general
approbation
of
the
country
it
enabled
congress
to
adjourn
with
that
dignity
and
deliberation
so
becoming
to
the
representatives
of
this
great
republic
without
having
crowded
into
general
appropriation
bills
provisions
foreign
to
their
nature
and
of
doubtful
constitutionality
and
expediency
let
me
warmly
and
strongly
commend
this
precedent
established
by
themselves
as
a
guide
to
their
proceedings
during
the
present
session

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
the
constitution
it
has
now
become
my
duty
to
give
to
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommend
to
their
consideration
such
measures
as
i
judge
to
be
necessary
and
expedient
but
first
and
above
all
our
thanks
are
due
to
almighty
god
for
the
numerous
benefits
which
he
has
bestowed
upon
this
people
and
our
united
prayers
ought
to
ascend
to
him
that
he
would
continue
to
bless
our
great
republic
in
time
to
come
as
he
has
blessed
it
in
time
past
since
the
adjournment
of
the
last
congress
our
constituents
have
enjoyed
an
unusual
degree
of
health
the
earth
has
yielded
her
fruits
abundantly
and
has
bountifully
rewarded
the
toil
of
the
husbandman
our
great
staples
have
commanded
high
prices
and
up
till
within
a
brief
period
our
manufacturing
mineral
and
mechanical
occupations
have
largely
partaken
of
the
general
prosperity
we
have
possessed
all
the
elements
of
material
wealth
in
rich
abundance
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
these
advantages
our
country
in
its
monetary
interests
is
at
the
present
moment
in
a
deplorable
condition
in
the
midst
of
unsurpassed
plenty
in
all
the
productions
of
agriculture
and
in
all
the
elements
of
national
wealth
we
find
our
manufactures
suspended
our
public
works
retarded
our
private
enterprises
of
different
kinds
abandoned
and
thousands
of
useful
laborers
thrown
out
of
employment
and
reduced
to
want
the
revenue
of
the
government
which
is
chiefly
derived
from
duties
on
imports
from
abroad
has
been
greatly
reduced
whilst
the
appropriations
made
by
congress
at
its
last
session
for
the
current
fiscal
year
are
very
large
in
amount
under
these
circumstances
a
loan
may
be
required
before
the
close
of
your
present
session
but
this
although
deeply
to
be
regretted
would
prove
to
be
only
a
slight
misfortune
when
compared
with
the
suffering
and
distress
prevailing
among
the
people
with
this
the
government
can
not
fail
deeply
to
sympathize
though
it
may
be
without
the
power
to
extend
relief
it
is
our
duty
to
inquire
what
has
produced
such
unfortunate
results
and
whether
their
recurrence
can
be
prevented
in
all
former
revulsions
the
blame
might
have
been
fairly
attributed
to
a
variety
of
cooperating
causes
but
not
so
upon
the
present
occasion
it
is
apparent
that
our
existing
misfortunes
have
proceeded
solely
from
our
extravagant
and
vicious
system
of
paper
currency
and
bank
credits
exciting
the
people
to
wild
speculations
and
gambling
in
stocks
these
revulsions
must
continue
to
recur
at
successive
intervals
so
long
as
the
amount
of
the
paper
currency
and
bank
loans
and
discounts
of
the
country
shall
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
irresponsible
banking
institutions
which
from
the
very
law
of
their
nature
will
consult
the
interest
of
their
stockholders
rather
than
the
public
welfare
the
framers
of
the
constitution
when
they
gave
to
congress
the
power
to
coin
money
and
to
regulate
the
value
thereof
and
prohibited
the
states
from
coining
money
emitting
bills
of
credit
or
making
anything
but
gold
and
silver
coin
a
tender
in
payment
of
debts
supposed
they
had
protected
the
people
against
the
evils
of
an
excessive
and
irredeemable
paper
currency
they
are
not
responsible
for
the
existing
anomaly
that
a
government
endowed
with
the
sovereign
attribute
of
coining
money
and
regulating
the
value
thereof
should
have
no
power
to
prevent
others
from
driving
this
coin
out
of
the
country
and
filling
up
the
channels
of
circulation
with
paper
which
does
not
represent
gold
and
silver
it
is
one
of
the
highest
and
most
responsible
duties
of
government
to
insure
to
the
people
a
sound
circulating
medium
the
amount
of
which
ought
to
be
adapted
with
the
utmost
possible
wisdom
and
skill
to
the
wants
of
internal
trade
and
foreign
exchanges
if
this
be
either
greatly
above
or
greatly
below
the
proper
standard
the
marketable
value
of
every
mans
property
is
increased
or
diminished
in
the
same
proportion
and
injustice
to
individuals
as
well
as
incalculable
evils
to
the
community
are
the
consequence
unfortunately
under
the
construction
of
the
federal
constitution
which
has
now
prevailed
too
long
to
be
changed
this
important
and
delicate
duty
has
been
dissevered
from
the
coining
power
and
virtually
transferred
to
more
than
state
banks
acting
independently
of
each
other
and
regulating
their
paper
issues
almost
exclusively
by
a
regard
to
the
present
interest
of
their
stockholders
exercising
the
sovereign
power
of
providing
a
paper
currency
instead
of
coin
for
the
country
the
first
duty
which
these
banks
owe
to
the
public
is
to
keep
in
their
vaults
a
sufficient
amount
of
gold
and
silver
to
insure
the
convertibility
of
their
notes
into
coin
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
no
bank
ought
ever
to
be
chartered
without
such
restrictions
on
its
business
as
to
secure
this
result
all
other
restrictions
are
comparatively
vain
this
is
the
only
true
touchstone
the
only
efficient
regulator
of
a
paper
currencythe
only
one
which
can
guard
the
public
against
overissues
and
bank
suspensions
as
a
collateral
and
eventual
security
it
is
doubtless
wise
and
in
all
cases
ought
to
be
required
that
banks
shall
hold
an
amount
of
united
states
or
state
securities
equal
to
their
notes
in
circulation
and
pledged
for
their
redemption
this
however
furnishes
no
adequate
security
against
overissue
on
the
contrary
it
may
be
perverted
to
inflate
the
currency
indeed
it
is
possible
by
this
means
to
convert
all
the
debts
of
the
united
states
and
state
governments
into
bank
notes
without
reference
to
the
specie
required
to
redeem
them
however
valuable
these
securities
may
be
in
themselves
they
can
not
be
converted
into
gold
and
silver
at
the
moment
of
pressure
as
our
experience
teaches
in
sufficient
time
to
prevent
bank
suspensions
and
the
depreciation
of
bank
notes
in
england
which
is
to
a
considerable
extent
a
papermoney
country
though
vastly
behind
our
own
in
this
respect
it
was
deemed
advisable
anterior
to
the
act
of
parliament
of
which
wisely
separated
the
issue
of
notes
from
the
banking
department
for
the
bank
of
england
always
to
keep
on
hand
gold
and
silver
equal
to
onethird
of
its
combined
circulation
and
deposits
if
this
proportion
was
no
more
than
sufficient
to
secure
the
convertibility
of
its
notes
with
the
whole
of
great
britain
and
to
some
extent
the
continent
of
europe
as
a
field
for
its
circulation
rendering
it
almost
impossible
that
a
sudden
and
immediate
run
to
a
dangerous
amount
should
be
made
upon
it
the
same
proportion
would
certainly
be
insufficient
under
our
banking
system
each
of
our
banks
has
but
a
limited
circumference
for
its
circulation
and
in
the
course
of
a
very
few
days
the
depositors
and
note
holders
might
demand
from
such
a
bank
a
sufficient
amount
in
specie
to
compel
it
to
suspend
even
although
it
had
coin
in
its
vaults
equal
to
onethird
of
its
immediate
liabilities
and
yet
i
am
not
aware
with
the
exception
of
the
banks
of
louisiana
that
any
state
bank
throughout
the
union
has
been
required
by
its
charter
to
keep
this
or
any
other
proportion
of
gold
and
silver
compared
with
the
amount
of
its
combined
circulation
and
deposits
what
has
been
the
consequence
in
a
recent
report
made
by
the
treasury
department
on
the
condition
of
the
banks
throughout
the
different
states
according
to
returns
dated
nearest
to
january
the
aggregate
amount
of
actual
specie
in
their
vaults
is
of
their
circulation
and
of
their
deposits
thus
it
appears
that
these
banks
in
the
aggregate
have
considerably
less
than
one
dollar
in
seven
of
gold
and
silver
compared
with
their
circulation
and
deposits
it
was
palpable
therefore
that
the
very
first
pressure
must
drive
them
to
suspension
and
deprive
the
people
of
a
convertible
currency
with
all
its
disastrous
consequences
it
is
truly
wonderful
that
they
should
have
so
long
continued
to
preserve
their
credit
when
a
demand
for
the
payment
of
oneseventh
of
their
immediate
liabilities
would
have
driven
them
into
insolvency
and
this
is
the
condition
of
the
banks
notwithstanding
that
four
hundred
millions
of
gold
from
california
have
flowed
in
upon
us
within
the
last
eight
years
and
the
tide
still
continues
to
flow
indeed
such
has
been
the
extravagance
of
bank
credits
that
the
banks
now
hold
a
considerably
less
amount
of
specie
either
in
proportion
to
their
capital
or
to
their
circulation
and
deposits
combined
than
they
did
before
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
whilst
in
the
year
their
specie
in
proportion
to
their
capital
was
more
than
equal
to
one
dollar
for
four
and
a
half
in
it
does
not
amount
to
one
dollar
for
every
six
dollars
and
thirtythree
cents
of
their
capital
in
the
year
the
specie
was
equal
within
a
very
small
fraction
to
one
dollar
in
five
of
their
circulation
and
deposits
in
it
is
not
equal
to
one
dollar
in
seven
and
a
half
of
their
circulation
and
deposits
from
this
statement
it
is
easy
to
account
for
our
financial
history
for
the
last
forty
years
it
has
been
a
history
of
extravagant
expansions
in
the
business
of
the
country
followed
by
ruinous
contractions
at
successive
intervals
the
best
and
most
enterprising
men
have
been
tempted
to
their
ruin
by
excessive
bank
loans
of
mere
paper
credit
exciting
them
to
extravagant
importations
of
foreign
goods
wild
speculations
and
ruinous
and
demoralizing
stock
gambling
when
the
crisis
arrives
as
arrive
it
must
the
banks
can
extend
no
relief
to
the
people
in
a
vain
struggle
to
redeem
their
liabilities
in
specie
they
are
compelled
to
contract
their
loans
and
their
issues
and
at
last
in
the
hour
of
distress
when
their
assistance
is
most
needed
they
and
their
debtors
together
sink
into
insolvency
it
is
this
paper
system
of
extravagant
expansion
raising
the
nominal
price
of
every
article
far
beyond
its
real
value
when
compared
with
the
cost
of
similar
articles
in
countries
whose
circulation
is
wisely
regulated
which
has
prevented
us
from
competing
in
our
own
markets
with
foreign
manufacturers
has
produced
extravagant
importations
and
has
counteracted
the
effect
of
the
la
rge
incidental
protection
afforded
to
our
domestic
manufactures
by
the
present
revenue
tariff
but
for
this
the
branches
of
our
manufactures
composed
of
raw
materials
the
production
of
our
own
countrysuch
as
cotton
iron
and
woolen
fabricswould
not
only
have
acquired
almost
exclusive
possession
of
the
home
market
but
would
have
created
for
themselves
a
foreign
market
throughout
the
world
deplorable
however
as
may
be
our
present
financial
condition
we
may
yet
indulge
in
bright
hopes
for
the
future
no
other
nation
has
ever
existed
which
could
have
endured
such
violent
expansions
and
contractions
of
paper
credits
without
lasting
injury
yet
the
buoyancy
of
youth
the
energies
of
our
population
and
the
spirit
which
never
quails
before
difficulties
will
enable
us
soon
to
recover
from
our
present
financial
embarrassments
and
may
even
occasion
us
speedily
to
forget
the
lesson
which
they
have
taught
in
the
meantime
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
by
all
proper
means
within
its
power
to
aid
in
alleviating
the
sufferings
of
the
people
occasioned
by
the
suspension
of
the
banks
and
to
provide
against
a
recurrence
of
the
same
calamity
unfortunately
in
either
aspect
of
the
case
it
can
do
but
little
thanks
to
the
independent
treasury
the
government
has
not
suspended
payment
as
it
was
compelled
to
do
by
the
failure
of
the
banks
in
it
will
continue
to
discharge
its
liabilities
to
the
people
in
gold
and
silver
its
disbursements
in
coin
will
pass
into
circulation
and
materially
assist
in
restoring
a
sound
currency
from
its
high
credit
should
we
be
compelled
to
make
a
temporary
loan
it
can
be
effected
on
advantageous
terms
this
however
shall
if
possible
be
avoided
but
if
not
then
the
amount
shall
be
limited
to
the
lowest
practicable
sum
i
have
therefore
determined
that
whilst
no
useful
government
works
already
in
progress
shall
be
suspended
new
works
not
already
commenced
will
be
postponed
if
this
can
be
done
without
injury
to
the
country
those
necessary
for
its
defense
shall
proceed
as
though
there
had
been
no
crisis
in
our
monetary
affairs
but
the
federal
government
can
not
do
much
to
provide
against
a
recurrence
of
existing
evils
even
if
insurmountable
constitutional
objections
did
not
exist
against
the
creation
of
a
national
bank
this
would
furnish
no
adequate
preventive
security
the
history
of
the
last
bank
of
the
united
states
abundantly
proves
the
truth
of
this
assertion
such
a
bank
could
not
if
it
would
regulate
the
issues
and
credits
of
state
banks
in
such
a
manner
as
to
prevent
the
ruinous
expansions
and
contractions
in
our
currency
which
afflicted
the
country
throughout
the
existence
of
the
late
bank
or
secure
us
against
future
suspensions
in
an
effort
was
made
by
the
bank
of
england
to
curtail
the
issues
of
the
country
banks
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
the
paper
currency
had
been
expanded
to
a
ruinous
extent
and
the
bank
put
forth
all
its
power
to
contract
it
in
order
to
reduce
prices
and
restore
the
equilibrium
of
the
foreign
exchanges
it
accordingly
commenced
a
system
of
curtailment
of
its
loans
and
issues
in
the
vain
hope
that
the
joint
stock
and
private
banks
of
the
kingdom
would
be
compelled
to
follow
its
example
it
found
however
that
as
it
contracted
they
expanded
and
at
the
end
of
the
process
to
employ
the
language
of
a
very
high
official
authority
whatever
reduction
of
the
paper
circulation
was
effected
by
the
bank
of
england
in
was
more
than
made
up
by
the
issues
of
the
country
banks
but
a
bank
of
the
united
states
would
not
if
it
could
restrain
the
issues
and
loans
of
the
state
banks
because
its
duty
as
a
regulator
of
the
currency
must
often
be
in
direct
conflict
with
the
immediate
interest
of
its
stockholders
if
we
expect
one
agent
to
restrain
or
control
another
their
interests
must
at
least
in
some
degree
be
antagonistic
but
the
directors
of
a
bank
of
the
united
states
would
feel
the
same
interest
and
the
same
inclination
with
the
directors
of
the
state
banks
to
expand
the
currency
to
accommodate
their
favorites
and
friends
with
loans
and
to
declare
large
dividends
such
has
been
our
experience
in
regard
to
the
last
bank
after
all
we
must
mainly
rely
upon
the
patriotism
and
wisdom
of
the
states
for
the
prevention
and
redress
of
the
evil
if
they
will
afford
us
a
real
specie
basis
for
our
paper
circulation
by
increasing
the
denomination
of
bank
notes
first
to
twenty
and
afterwards
to
fifty
dollars
if
they
will
require
that
the
banks
shall
at
all
times
keep
on
hand
at
least
one
dollar
of
gold
and
silver
for
every
three
dollars
of
their
circulation
and
deposits
and
if
they
will
provide
by
a
selfexecuting
enactment
which
nothing
can
arrest
that
the
moment
they
suspend
they
shall
go
into
liquidation
i
believe
that
such
provisions
with
a
weekly
publication
by
each
bank
of
a
statement
of
its
condition
would
go
far
to
secure
us
against
future
suspensions
of
specie
payments
congress
in
my
opinion
possess
the
power
to
pass
a
uniform
bankrupt
law
applicable
to
all
banking
institutions
throughout
the
united
states
and
i
strongly
recommend
its
exercise
this
would
make
it
the
irreversible
organic
law
of
each
banks
existence
that
a
suspension
of
specie
payments
shall
produce
its
civil
death
the
instinct
of
selfpreservation
would
then
compel
it
to
perform
its
duties
in
such
a
manner
as
to
escape
the
penalty
and
preserve
its
life
the
existence
of
banks
and
the
circulation
of
bank
paper
are
so
identified
with
the
habits
of
our
people
that
they
can
not
at
this
day
be
suddenly
abolished
without
much
immediate
injury
to
the
country
if
we
could
confine
them
to
their
appropriate
sphere
and
prevent
them
from
administering
to
the
spirit
of
wild
and
reckless
speculation
by
extravagant
loans
and
issues
they
might
be
continued
with
advantage
to
the
public
but
this
i
say
after
long
and
much
reflection
if
experience
shall
prove
it
to
be
impossible
to
enjoy
the
facilities
which
wellregulated
banks
might
afford
without
at
the
same
time
suffering
the
calamities
which
the
excesses
of
the
banks
have
hitherto
inflicted
upon
the
country
it
would
then
be
far
the
lesser
evil
to
deprive
them
altogether
of
the
power
to
issue
a
paper
currency
and
confine
them
to
the
functions
of
banks
of
deposit
and
discount
our
relations
with
foreign
governments
are
upon
the
whole
in
a
satisfactory
condition
the
diplomatic
difficulties
which
existed
between
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
that
of
great
britain
at
the
adjournment
of
the
last
congress
have
been
happily
terminated
by
the
appointment
of
a
british
minister
to
this
country
who
has
been
cordially
received
whilst
it
is
greatly
to
the
interest
as
i
am
convinced
it
is
the
sincere
desire
of
the
governments
and
people
of
the
two
countries
to
be
on
terms
of
intimate
friendship
with
each
other
it
has
been
our
misfortune
almost
always
to
have
had
some
irritating
if
not
dangerous
outstanding
question
with
great
britain
since
the
origin
of
the
government
we
have
been
employed
in
negotiating
treaties
with
that
power
and
afterwards
in
discussing
their
true
intent
and
meaning
in
this
respect
the
convention
of
april
commonly
called
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
has
been
the
most
unfortunate
of
all
because
the
two
governments
place
directly
opposite
and
contradictory
constructions
upon
its
first
and
most
important
article
whilst
in
the
united
states
we
believed
that
this
treaty
would
place
both
powers
upon
an
exact
equality
by
the
stipulation
that
neither
will
ever
occupy
or
fortify
or
colonize
or
assume
or
exercise
any
dominion
over
any
part
of
central
america
it
is
contended
by
the
british
government
that
the
true
construction
of
this
language
has
left
them
in
the
rightful
possession
of
all
that
portion
of
central
america
which
was
in
their
occupancy
at
the
date
of
the
treaty
in
fact
that
the
treaty
is
a
virtual
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
of
the
right
of
great
britain
either
as
owner
or
protector
to
the
whole
extensive
coast
of
central
america
sweeping
round
from
the
rio
hondo
to
the
port
and
harbor
of
san
juan
de
nicaragua
together
with
the
adjacent
bay
islands
except
the
comparatively
small
portion
of
this
between
the
sarstoon
and
cape
honduras
according
to
their
construction
the
treaty
does
no
more
than
simply
prohibit
them
from
extending
their
possessions
in
central
america
beyond
the
present
limits
it
is
not
too
much
to
assert
that
if
in
the
united
states
the
treaty
had
been
considered
susceptible
of
such
a
construction
it
never
would
have
been
negotiated
under
the
authority
of
the
president
nor
would
it
have
received
the
approbation
of
the
senate
the
universal
conviction
in
the
united
states
was
that
when
our
government
consented
to
violate
its
traditional
and
timehonored
policy
and
to
stipulate
with
a
foreign
government
never
to
occupy
or
acquire
territory
in
the
central
american
portion
of
our
own
continent
the
consideration
for
this
sacrifice
was
that
great
britain
should
in
this
respect
at
least
be
placed
in
the
same
position
with
ourselves
whilst
we
have
no
right
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
the
british
government
in
their
construction
of
the
treaty
it
is
at
the
same
time
my
deliberate
conviction
that
this
construction
is
in
opposition
both
to
its
letter
and
its
spirit
under
the
late
administration
negotiations
were
instituted
between
the
two
governments
for
the
purpose
if
possible
of
removing
these
difficulties
and
a
treaty
having
this
laudable
object
in
view
was
signed
at
london
on
the
th
october
and
was
submitted
by
the
president
to
the
senate
on
the
following
th
of
december
whether
this
treaty
either
in
its
original
or
amended
form
would
have
accomplished
the
object
intended
without
giving
birth
to
new
and
embarrassing
complications
between
the
two
governments
may
perhaps
be
well
questioned
certain
it
is
however
it
was
rendered
much
less
objectionable
by
the
different
amendments
made
to
it
by
the
senate
the
treaty
as
amended
was
ratified
by
me
on
the
th
march
and
was
transmitted
to
london
for
ratification
by
the
british
government
that
government
expressed
its
willingnes
s
to
concur
in
all
the
amendments
made
by
the
senate
with
the
single
exception
of
the
clause
relating
to
ruatan
and
the
other
islands
in
the
bay
of
honduras
the
article
in
the
original
treaty
as
submitted
to
the
senate
after
reciting
that
these
islands
and
their
inhabitants
having
been
by
a
convention
bearing
date
the
th
day
of
august
between
her
britannic
majesty
and
the
republic
of
honduras
constituted
and
declared
a
free
territory
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
said
republic
of
honduras
stipulated
that
the
two
contracting
parties
do
hereby
mutually
engage
to
recognize
and
respect
in
all
future
time
the
independence
and
rights
of
the
said
free
territory
as
a
part
of
the
republic
of
honduras
upon
an
examination
of
this
convention
between
great
britain
and
honduras
of
the
th
august
it
was
found
that
whilst
declaring
the
bay
islands
to
be
a
free
territory
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
republic
of
honduras
it
deprived
that
republic
of
rights
without
which
its
sovereignty
over
them
could
scarcely
be
said
to
exist
it
divided
them
from
the
remainder
of
honduras
and
gave
to
their
inhabitants
a
separate
government
of
their
own
with
legislative
executive
and
judicial
officers
elected
by
themselves
it
deprived
the
government
of
honduras
of
the
taxing
power
in
every
form
and
exempted
the
people
of
the
islands
from
the
performance
of
military
duty
except
for
their
own
exclusive
defense
it
also
prohibited
that
republic
from
erecting
fortifications
upon
them
for
their
protection
thus
leaving
them
open
to
invasion
from
any
quarter
and
finally
it
provided
that
slavery
shall
not
at
any
time
hereafter
be
permitted
to
exist
therein
had
honduras
ratified
this
convention
she
would
have
ratified
the
establishment
of
a
state
substantially
independent
within
her
own
limits
and
a
state
at
all
times
subject
to
british
influence
and
control
moreover
had
the
united
states
ratified
the
treaty
with
great
britain
in
its
original
form
we
should
have
been
bound
to
recognize
and
respect
in
all
future
time
these
stipulations
to
the
prejudice
of
honduras
being
in
direct
opposition
to
the
spirit
and
meaning
of
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
as
understood
in
the
united
states
the
senate
rejected
the
entire
clause
and
substituted
in
its
stead
a
simple
recognition
of
the
sovereign
right
of
honduras
to
these
islands
in
the
following
language
the
two
contracting
parties
do
hereby
mutually
engage
to
recognize
and
respect
the
islands
of
ruatan
bonaco
utila
barbaretta
helena
and
moral
situate
in
the
bay
of
honduras
and
off
the
coast
of
the
republic
of
honduras
as
under
the
sovereignty
and
as
part
of
the
said
republic
of
honduras
great
britain
rejected
this
amendment
assigning
as
the
only
reason
that
the
ratifications
of
the
convention
of
the
th
august
between
her
and
honduras
had
not
been
exchanged
owing
to
the
hesitation
of
that
government
had
this
been
done
it
is
stated
that
her
majestys
government
would
have
had
little
difficulty
in
agreeing
to
the
modification
proposed
by
the
senate
which
then
would
have
had
in
effect
the
same
signification
as
the
original
wording
whether
this
would
have
been
the
effect
whether
the
mere
circumstance
of
the
exchange
of
the
ratifications
of
the
british
convention
with
honduras
prior
in
point
of
time
to
the
ratification
of
our
treaty
with
great
britain
would
in
effect
have
had
the
same
signification
as
the
original
wording
and
thus
have
nullified
the
amendment
of
the
senate
may
well
be
doubted
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
that
the
question
has
never
arisen
the
british
government
immediately
after
rejecting
the
treaty
as
amended
proposed
to
enter
into
a
new
treaty
with
the
united
states
similar
in
all
respects
to
the
treaty
which
they
had
just
refused
to
ratify
if
the
united
states
would
consent
to
add
to
the
senates
clear
and
unqualified
recognition
of
the
sovereignty
of
honduras
over
the
bay
islands
the
following
conditional
stipulation
whenever
and
so
soon
as
the
republic
of
honduras
shall
have
concluded
and
ratified
a
treaty
with
great
britain
by
which
great
britain
shall
have
ceded
and
the
republic
of
honduras
shall
have
accepted
the
said
islands
subject
to
the
provisions
and
conditions
contained
in
such
treaty
this
proposition
was
of
course
rejected
after
the
senate
had
refused
to
recognize
the
british
convention
with
honduras
of
the
th
august
with
full
knowledge
of
its
contents
it
was
impossible
for
me
necessarily
ignorant
of
the
provisions
and
conditions
which
might
be
contained
in
a
future
convention
between
the
same
parties
to
sanction
them
in
advance
the
fact
is
that
when
two
nations
like
great
britain
and
the
united
states
mutually
desirous
as
they
are
and
i
trust
ever
may
be
of
maintaining
the
most
friendly
relations
with
each
other
have
unfortunately
concluded
a
treaty
which
they
understand
in
senses
directly
opposite
the
wisest
course
is
to
abrogate
such
a
treaty
by
mutual
consent
and
to
commence
anew
had
this
been
done
promptly
all
difficulties
in
central
america
would
most
probably
ere
this
have
been
adjusted
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
parties
the
time
spent
in
discussing
the
meaning
of
the
clayton
and
bulwer
treaty
would
have
been
devoted
to
this
praiseworthy
purpose
and
the
task
would
have
been
the
more
easily
accomplished
because
the
interest
of
the
two
countries
in
central
america
is
identical
being
confined
to
securing
safe
transits
over
all
the
routes
across
the
isthmus
whilst
entertaining
these
sentiments
i
shall
nevertheless
not
refuse
to
contribute
to
any
reasonable
adjustment
of
the
central
american
questions
which
is
not
practically
inconsistent
with
the
american
interpretation
of
the
treaty
overtures
for
this
purpose
have
been
recently
made
by
the
british
government
in
a
friendly
spirit
which
i
cordially
reciprocate
but
whether
this
renewed
effort
will
result
in
success
i
am
not
yet
prepared
to
express
an
opinion
a
brief
period
will
determine
with
france
our
ancient
relations
of
friendship
still
continue
to
exist
the
french
government
have
in
several
recent
instances
which
need
not
be
enumerated
evinced
a
spirit
of
good
will
and
kindness
toward
our
country
which
i
heartily
reciprocate
it
is
notwithstanding
much
to
be
regretted
that
two
nations
whose
productions
are
of
such
a
character
as
to
invite
the
most
extensive
exchanges
and
freest
commercial
intercourse
should
continue
to
enforce
ancient
and
obsolete
restrictions
of
trade
against
each
other
our
commercial
treaty
with
france
is
in
this
respect
an
exception
from
our
treaties
with
all
other
commercial
nations
it
jealously
levies
discriminating
duties
both
on
tonnage
and
on
articles
the
growth
produce
or
manufacture
of
the
one
country
when
arriving
in
vessels
belonging
to
the
other
more
than
forty
years
ago
on
the
d
march
congress
passed
an
act
offering
to
all
nations
to
admit
their
vessels
laden
with
their
national
productions
into
the
ports
of
the
united
states
upon
the
same
terms
with
our
own
vessels
provided
they
would
reciprocate
to
us
similar
advantages
this
act
confined
the
reciprocity
to
the
productions
of
the
respective
foreign
nations
who
might
enter
into
the
proposed
arrangement
with
the
united
states
the
act
of
may
removed
this
restriction
and
offered
a
similar
reciprocity
to
all
such
vessels
without
reference
to
the
origin
of
their
cargoes
upon
these
principles
our
commercial
treaties
and
arrangements
have
been
rounded
except
with
france
and
let
us
hope
that
this
exception
may
not
long
exist
our
relations
with
russia
remain
as
they
have
ever
been
on
the
most
friendly
footing
the
present
emperor
as
well
as
his
predecessors
have
never
failed
when
the
occasion
offered
to
manifest
their
good
will
to
our
country
and
their
friendship
has
always
been
highly
appreciated
by
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
with
all
other
european
governments
except
that
of
spain
our
relations
are
as
peaceful
as
we
could
desire
i
regret
to
say
that
no
progress
whatever
has
been
made
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
toward
the
settlement
of
any
of
the
numerous
claims
of
our
citizens
against
the
spanish
government
besides
the
outrage
committed
on
our
flag
by
the
spanish
war
frigate
ferrolana
on
the
high
seas
off
the
coast
of
cuba
in
march
by
firing
into
the
american
mail
steamer
el
dorado
and
detaining
and
searching
her
remains
unacknowledged
and
unredressed
the
general
tone
and
temper
of
the
spanish
government
toward
that
of
the
united
states
are
much
to
be
regretted
our
present
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
madrid
has
asked
to
be
recalled
and
it
is
my
purpose
to
send
out
a
new
minister
to
spain
with
special
instructions
on
all
questions
pending
between
the
two
governments
and
with
a
determination
to
have
them
speedily
and
amicably
adjusted
if
this
be
possible
in
the
meantime
whenever
our
minister
urges
the
just
claims
of
our
citizens
on
the
notice
of
the
spanish
government
he
is
met
with
the
objection
that
congress
has
never
made
the
appropriation
recommended
by
president
polk
in
his
annual
message
of
december
to
be
paid
to
the
spanish
government
for
the
purpose
of
distribution
among
the
claimants
in
the
amistad
case
a
similar
recommendation
was
made
by
my
immediate
predecessor
in
his
message
of
december
and
entirely
concurring
with
both
in
the
opinion
that
this
indemnity
is
justly
due
under
the
treaty
with
spain
of
the
th
of
october
i
earnestly
recommend
such
an
appropriation
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
a
treaty
of
friendship
and
commerce
was
concluded
at
constantinople
on
the
th
december
between
the
united
states
and
persia
the
ratifications
of
which
were
exchanged
at
constantinople
on
the
th
june
and
the
treaty
was
proclaimed
by
the
president
on
the
th
august
this
treaty
it
is
believed
will
prove
beneficial
to
american
commerce
the
shah
has
manifested
an
earnest
disposition
to
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
our
country
and
has
expressed
a
strong
wish
that
we
should
be
represented
at
teheran
by
a
minister
plenipotentiary
and
i
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
for
this
purpose
recent
occurrences
i
n
china
have
been
unfavorable
to
a
revision
of
the
treaty
with
that
empire
of
the
d
july
with
a
view
to
the
security
and
extension
of
our
commerce
the
twentyfourth
article
of
this
treaty
stipulated
for
a
revision
of
it
in
case
experience
should
prove
this
to
be
requisite
in
which
case
the
two
governments
will
at
the
expiration
of
twelve
years
from
the
date
of
said
convention
treat
amicably
concerning
the
same
by
means
of
suitable
persons
appointed
to
conduct
such
negotiations
these
twelve
years
expired
on
the
d
july
but
long
before
that
period
it
was
ascertained
that
important
changes
in
the
treaty
were
necessary
and
several
fruitless
attempts
were
made
by
the
commissioner
of
the
united
states
to
effect
these
changes
another
effort
was
about
to
be
made
for
the
same
purpose
by
our
commissioner
in
conjunction
with
the
ministers
of
england
and
france
but
this
was
suspended
by
the
occurrence
of
hostilities
in
the
canton
river
between
great
britain
and
the
chinese
empire
these
hostilities
have
necessarily
interrupted
the
trade
of
all
nations
with
canton
which
is
now
in
a
state
of
blockade
and
have
occasioned
a
serious
loss
of
life
and
property
meanwhile
the
insurrection
within
the
empire
against
the
existing
imperial
dynasty
still
continues
and
it
is
difficult
to
anticipate
what
will
be
the
result
under
these
circumstances
i
have
deemed
it
advisable
to
appoint
a
distinguished
citizen
of
pennsylvania
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
proceed
to
china
and
to
avail
himself
of
any
opportunities
which
may
offer
to
effect
changes
in
the
existing
treaty
favorable
to
american
commerce
he
left
the
united
states
for
the
place
of
his
destination
in
july
last
in
the
war
steamer
minnesota
special
ministers
to
china
have
also
been
appointed
by
the
governments
of
great
britain
and
france
whilst
our
minister
has
been
instructed
to
occupy
a
neutral
position
in
reference
to
the
existing
hostilities
at
canton
he
will
cordially
cooperate
with
the
british
and
french
ministers
in
all
peaceful
measures
to
secure
by
treaty
stipulations
those
just
concessions
to
commerce
which
the
nations
of
the
world
have
a
right
to
expect
and
which
china
can
not
long
be
permitted
to
withhold
from
assurances
received
i
entertain
no
doubt
that
the
three
ministers
will
act
in
harmonious
concert
to
obtain
similar
commercial
treaties
for
each
of
the
powers
they
represent
we
can
not
fail
to
feel
a
deep
interest
in
all
that
concerns
the
welfare
of
the
independent
republics
on
our
own
continent
as
well
as
of
the
empire
of
brazil
our
difficulties
with
new
granada
which
a
short
time
since
bore
so
threatening
an
aspect
are
it
is
to
be
hoped
in
a
fair
train
of
settlement
in
a
manner
just
and
honorable
to
both
parties
the
isthmus
of
central
america
including
that
of
panama
is
the
great
highway
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
over
which
a
large
portion
of
the
commerce
of
the
world
is
destined
to
pass
the
united
states
are
more
deeply
interested
than
any
other
nation
in
preserving
the
freedom
and
security
of
all
the
communications
across
this
isthmus
it
is
our
duty
therefore
to
take
care
that
they
shall
not
be
interrupted
either
by
invasions
from
our
own
country
or
by
wars
between
the
independent
states
of
central
america
under
our
treaty
with
new
granada
of
the
th
december
we
are
bound
to
guarantee
the
neutrality
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
through
which
the
panama
railroad
passes
as
well
as
the
rights
of
sovereignty
and
property
which
new
granada
has
and
possesses
over
the
said
territory
this
obligation
is
rounded
upon
equivalents
granted
by
the
treaty
to
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
under
these
circumstances
i
recommend
to
congress
the
passage
of
an
act
authorizing
the
president
in
case
of
necessity
to
employ
the
land
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
to
carry
into
effect
this
guaranty
of
neutrality
and
protection
i
also
recommend
similar
legislation
for
the
security
of
any
other
route
across
the
isthmus
in
which
we
may
acquire
an
interest
by
treaty
with
the
independent
republics
on
this
continent
it
is
both
our
duty
and
our
interest
to
cultivate
the
most
friendly
relations
we
can
never
feel
indifferent
to
their
fate
and
must
always
rejoice
in
their
prosperity
unfortunately
both
for
them
and
for
us
our
example
and
advice
have
lost
much
of
their
influence
in
consequence
of
the
lawless
expeditions
which
have
been
fitted
out
against
some
of
them
within
the
limits
of
our
country
nothing
is
better
calculated
to
retard
our
steady
material
progress
or
impair
our
character
as
a
nation
than
the
toleration
of
such
enterprises
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
it
is
one
of
the
first
and
highest
duties
of
any
independent
state
in
its
relations
with
the
members
of
the
great
family
of
nations
to
restrain
its
people
from
acts
of
hostile
aggression
against
their
citizens
or
subjects
the
most
eminent
writers
on
public
law
do
not
hesitate
to
denounce
such
hostile
acts
as
robbery
and
murder
weak
and
feeble
states
like
those
of
central
america
may
not
feel
themselves
able
to
assert
and
vindicate
their
rights
the
case
would
be
far
different
if
expeditions
were
set
on
foot
within
our
own
territories
to
make
private
war
against
a
powerful
nation
if
such
expeditions
were
fitted
out
from
abroad
against
any
portion
of
our
own
country
to
burn
down
our
cities
murder
and
plunder
our
people
and
usurp
our
government
we
should
call
any
power
on
earth
to
the
strictest
account
for
not
preventing
such
enormities
ever
since
the
administration
of
general
washington
acts
of
congress
have
been
enforced
to
punish
severely
the
crime
of
setting
on
foot
a
military
expedition
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
to
proceed
from
thence
against
a
nation
or
state
with
whom
we
are
at
peace
the
present
neutrality
act
of
april
is
but
little
more
than
a
collection
of
preexisting
laws
under
this
act
the
president
is
empowered
to
employ
the
land
and
naval
forces
and
the
militia
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
carrying
on
of
any
such
expedition
or
enterprise
from
the
territories
and
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
the
collectors
of
customs
are
authorized
and
required
to
detain
any
vessel
in
port
when
there
is
reason
to
believe
she
is
about
to
take
part
in
such
lawless
enterprises
when
it
was
first
rendered
probable
that
an
attempt
would
be
made
to
get
up
another
unlawful
expedition
against
nicaragua
the
secretary
of
state
issued
instructions
to
the
marshals
and
district
attorneys
which
were
directed
by
the
secretaries
of
war
and
the
navy
to
the
appropriate
army
and
navy
officers
requiring
them
to
be
vigilant
and
to
use
their
best
exertions
in
carrying
into
effect
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
notwithstanding
these
precautions
the
expedition
has
escaped
from
our
shores
such
enterprises
can
do
no
possible
good
to
the
country
but
have
already
inflicted
much
injury
both
on
its
interests
and
its
character
they
have
prevented
peaceful
emigration
from
the
united
states
to
the
states
of
central
america
which
could
not
fail
to
prove
highly
beneficial
to
all
the
parties
concerned
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
alone
our
citizens
have
sustained
heavy
losses
from
the
seizure
and
closing
of
the
transit
route
by
the
san
juan
between
the
two
oceans
the
leader
of
the
recent
expedition
was
arrested
at
new
orleans
but
was
discharged
on
giving
bail
for
his
appearance
in
the
insufficient
sum
of
i
commend
the
whole
subject
to
the
serious
attention
of
congress
believing
that
our
duty
and
our
interest
as
well
as
our
national
character
require
that
we
should
adopt
such
measures
as
will
be
effectual
in
restraining
our
citizens
from
committing
such
outrages
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
the
president
of
paraguay
has
refused
to
ratify
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
that
state
as
amended
by
the
senate
the
signature
of
which
was
mentioned
in
the
message
of
my
predecessor
to
congress
at
the
opening
of
its
session
in
december
the
reasons
assigned
for
this
refusal
will
appear
in
the
correspondence
herewith
submitted
it
being
desirable
to
ascertain
the
fitness
of
the
river
la
plata
and
its
tributaries
for
navigation
by
steam
the
united
states
steamer
water
witch
was
sent
thither
for
that
purpose
in
this
enterprise
was
successfully
carried
on
until
february
when
whilst
in
the
peaceful
prosecution
of
her
voyage
up
the
parana
river
the
steamer
was
fired
upon
by
a
paraguayan
fort
the
fire
was
returned
but
as
the
water
witch
was
of
small
force
and
not
designed
for
offensive
operations
she
retired
from
the
conflict
the
pretext
upon
which
the
attack
was
made
was
a
decree
of
the
president
of
paraguay
of
october
prohibiting
foreign
vessels
of
war
from
navigating
the
rivers
of
that
state
as
paraguay
however
was
the
owner
of
but
one
bank
of
the
river
of
that
name
the
other
belonging
to
corientes
a
state
of
the
argentine
confederation
the
right
of
its
government
to
expect
that
such
a
decree
would
be
obeyed
can
not
be
acknowledged
but
the
water
witch
was
not
properly
speaking
a
vessel
of
war
she
was
a
small
steamer
engaged
in
a
scientific
enterprise
intended
for
the
advantage
of
commercial
states
generally
under
these
circumstances
i
am
constrained
to
consider
the
attack
upon
her
as
unjustifiable
and
as
calling
for
satisfaction
from
the
paraguayan
government
citizens
of
the
united
states
also
who
were
established
in
business
in
paraguay
have
had
their
property
seized
and
taken
from
them
and
have
otherwise
been
treated
by
the
authorities
in
an
insulting
and
arbitrary
manner
which
requires
redress
a
demand
for
these
purposes
will
be
made
in
a
firm
but
conciliatory
spirit
this
will
the
more
probably
be
granted
if
the
executive
shall
have
authority
to
use
other
means
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
this
is
accordingly
recommended
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
in
detail
the
alarming
condition
of
the
territory
of
kansas
at
the
time
of
my
inauguration
the
opposing
parties
then
stood
in
hostile
array
against
each
other
and
any
accident
might
have
relighted
the
flames
of
civil
war
besides
at
this
critical
moment
kansas
was
lef
t
without
a
governor
by
the
resignation
of
governor
geary
on
the
th
of
february
previous
the
territorial
legislature
had
passed
a
law
providing
for
the
election
of
delegates
on
the
third
monday
of
june
to
a
convention
to
meet
on
the
first
monday
of
september
for
the
purpose
of
framing
a
constitution
preparatory
to
admission
into
the
union
this
law
was
in
the
main
fair
and
just
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
all
the
qualified
electors
had
not
registered
themselves
and
voted
under
its
provisions
at
the
time
of
the
election
for
delegates
an
extensive
organization
existed
in
the
territory
whose
avowed
object
it
was
if
need
be
to
put
down
the
lawful
government
by
force
and
to
establish
a
government
of
their
own
under
the
socalled
topeka
constitution
the
persons
attached
to
this
revolutionary
organization
abstained
from
taking
any
part
in
the
election
the
act
of
the
territorial
legislature
had
omitted
to
provide
for
submitting
to
the
people
the
constitution
which
might
be
framed
by
the
convention
and
in
the
excited
state
of
public
feeling
throughout
kansas
an
apprehension
extensively
prevailed
that
a
design
existed
to
force
upon
them
a
constitution
in
relation
to
slavery
against
their
will
in
this
emergency
it
became
my
duty
as
it
was
my
unquestionable
right
having
in
view
the
union
of
all
good
citizens
in
support
of
the
territorial
laws
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
true
construction
of
the
provisions
concerning
slavery
contained
in
the
organic
act
of
congress
of
the
th
may
congress
declared
it
to
be
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
this
act
not
to
legislate
slavery
into
any
territory
or
state
nor
to
exclude
it
therefrom
but
to
leave
the
people
thereof
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
under
it
kansas
when
admitted
as
a
state
was
to
be
received
into
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitution
may
prescribe
at
the
time
of
their
admission
did
congress
mean
by
this
language
that
the
delegates
elected
to
frame
a
constitution
should
have
authority
finally
to
decide
the
question
of
slavery
or
did
they
intend
by
leaving
it
to
the
people
that
the
people
of
kansas
themselves
should
decide
this
question
by
a
direct
vote
on
this
subject
i
confess
i
had
never
entertained
a
serious
doubt
and
therefore
in
my
instructions
to
governor
walker
of
the
th
march
last
i
merely
said
that
when
a
constitution
shall
be
submitted
to
the
people
of
the
territory
they
must
be
protected
in
the
exercise
of
their
right
of
voting
for
or
against
that
instrument
and
the
fair
expression
of
the
popular
will
must
not
be
interrupted
by
fraud
or
violence
in
expressing
this
opinion
it
was
far
from
my
intention
to
interfere
with
the
decision
of
the
people
of
kansas
either
for
or
against
slavery
from
this
i
have
always
carefully
abstained
intrusted
with
the
duty
of
taking
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
my
only
desire
was
that
the
people
of
kansas
should
furnish
to
congress
the
evidence
required
by
the
organic
act
whether
for
or
against
slavery
and
in
this
manner
smooth
their
passage
into
the
union
in
emerging
from
the
condition
of
territorial
dependence
into
that
of
a
sovereign
state
it
was
their
duty
in
my
opinion
to
make
known
their
will
by
the
votes
of
the
majority
on
the
direct
question
whether
this
important
domestic
institution
should
or
should
not
continue
to
exist
indeed
this
was
the
only
possible
mode
in
which
their
will
could
be
authentically
ascertained
the
election
of
delegates
to
a
convention
must
necessarily
take
place
in
separate
districts
from
this
cause
it
may
readily
happen
as
has
often
been
the
case
that
a
majority
of
the
people
of
a
state
or
territory
are
on
one
side
of
a
question
whilst
a
majority
of
the
representatives
from
the
several
districts
into
which
it
is
divided
may
be
upon
the
other
side
this
arises
front
the
fact
that
in
some
districts
delegates
may
be
elected
by
small
majorities
whilst
in
others
those
of
different
sentiments
may
receive
majorities
sufficiently
great
not
only
to
overcome
the
votes
given
for
the
former
but
to
leave
a
large
majority
of
the
whole
people
in
direct
opposition
to
a
majority
of
the
delegates
besides
our
history
proves
that
influences
may
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
representative
sufficiently
powerful
to
induce
him
to
disregard
the
will
of
his
constituents
the
truth
is
that
no
other
authentic
and
satisfactory
mode
exists
of
ascertaining
the
will
of
a
majority
of
the
people
of
any
state
or
territory
on
an
important
and
exciting
question
like
that
of
slavery
in
kansas
except
by
leaving
it
to
a
direct
vote
how
wise
then
was
it
for
congress
to
pass
over
all
subordinate
and
intermediate
agencies
and
proceed
directly
to
the
source
of
all
legitimate
power
under
our
institutions
how
vain
would
any
other
principle
prove
in
practice
this
may
be
illustrated
by
the
case
of
kansas
should
she
be
admitted
into
the
union
with
a
constitution
either
maintaining
or
abolishing
slavery
against
the
sentiment
of
the
people
this
could
have
no
other
effect
than
to
continue
and
to
exasperate
the
existing
agitation
during
the
brief
period
required
to
make
the
constitution
conform
to
the
irresistible
will
of
the
majority
the
friends
and
supporters
of
the
nebraska
and
kansas
act
when
struggling
on
a
recent
occasion
to
sustain
its
wise
provisions
before
the
great
tribunal
of
the
american
people
never
differed
about
its
true
meaning
on
this
subject
everywhere
throughout
the
union
they
publicly
pledged
their
faith
and
their
honor
that
they
would
cheerfully
submit
the
question
of
slavery
to
the
decision
of
the
bona
fide
people
of
kansas
without
any
restriction
or
qualification
whatever
all
were
cordially
united
upon
the
great
doctrine
of
popular
sovereignty
which
is
the
vital
principle
of
our
free
institutions
had
it
then
been
insinuated
from
any
quarter
that
it
would
be
a
sufficient
compliance
with
the
requisitions
of
the
organic
law
for
the
members
of
a
convention
thereafter
to
be
elected
to
withhold
the
question
of
slavery
from
the
people
and
to
substitute
their
own
will
for
that
of
a
legally
ascertained
majority
of
all
their
constituents
this
would
have
been
instantly
rejected
everywhere
they
remained
true
to
the
resolution
adopted
on
a
celebrated
occasion
recognizing
the
right
of
the
people
of
all
the
territories
including
kansas
and
nebraska
acting
through
the
legally
and
fairly
expressed
will
of
a
majority
of
actual
residents
and
whenever
the
number
of
their
inhabitants
justifies
it
to
form
a
constitution
with
or
without
slavery
and
be
admitted
into
the
union
upon
terms
of
perfect
equality
with
the
other
states
the
convention
to
frame
a
constitution
for
kansas
met
on
the
first
monday
of
september
last
they
were
called
together
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
the
territorial
legislature
whose
lawful
existence
had
been
recognized
by
congress
in
different
forms
and
by
different
enactments
a
large
proportion
of
the
citizens
of
kansas
did
not
think
proper
to
register
their
names
and
to
vote
at
the
election
for
delegates
but
an
opportunity
to
do
this
having
been
fairly
afforded
their
refusal
to
avail
themselves
of
their
right
could
in
no
manner
affect
the
legality
of
the
convention
this
convention
proceeded
to
frame
a
constitution
for
kansas
and
finally
adjourned
on
the
th
day
of
november
but
little
difficulty
occurred
in
the
convention
except
on
the
subject
of
slavery
the
truth
is
that
the
general
provisions
of
our
recent
state
constitutions
are
so
similar
and
i
may
add
so
excellent
that
the
difference
between
them
is
not
essential
under
the
earlier
practice
of
the
government
no
constitution
framed
by
the
convention
of
a
territory
preparatory
to
its
admission
into
the
union
as
a
state
had
been
submitted
to
the
people
i
trust
however
the
example
set
by
the
last
congress
requiring
that
the
constitution
of
minnesota
should
be
subject
to
the
approval
and
ratification
of
the
people
of
the
proposed
state
may
be
followed
on
future
occasions
i
took
it
for
granted
that
the
convention
of
kansas
would
act
in
accordance
with
this
example
rounded
as
it
is
on
correct
principles
and
hence
my
instructions
to
governor
walker
in
favor
of
submitting
the
constitution
to
the
people
were
expressed
in
general
and
unqualified
terms
in
the
kansasnebraska
act
however
this
requirement
as
applicable
to
the
whole
constitution
had
not
been
inserted
and
the
convention
were
not
bound
by
its
terms
to
submit
any
other
portion
of
the
instrument
to
an
election
except
that
which
relates
to
the
domestic
institution
of
slavery
this
will
be
rendered
clear
by
a
simple
reference
to
its
language
it
was
not
to
legislate
slavery
into
any
territory
or
state
nor
to
exclude
it
therefrom
but
to
leave
the
people
thereof
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
according
to
the
plain
construction
of
the
sentence
the
words
domestic
institutions
have
a
direct
as
they
have
an
appropriate
reference
to
slavery
domestic
institutions
are
limited
to
the
family
the
relation
between
master
and
slave
and
a
few
others
are
domestic
institutions
and
are
entirely
distinct
from
institutions
of
a
political
character
besides
there
was
no
question
then
before
congress
nor
indeed
has
there
since
been
any
serious
question
before
the
people
of
kansas
or
the
country
except
that
which
relates
to
the
domestic
institution
of
slavery
the
convention
after
an
angry
and
excited
debate
finally
determined
by
a
majority
of
only
two
to
submit
the
question
of
slavery
to
the
people
though
at
the
last
fortythree
of
the
fifty
delegates
present
affixed
their
signatures
to
the
constitution
a
large
majority
of
the
convention
were
in
favor
of
establishing
slavery
in
kansas
they
accordingly
inserted
an
article
in
the
constitution
for
this
purpose
similar
in
form
to
those
which
had
been
adopted
by
other
territorial
conventions
in
the
schedule
however
providing
for
the
transition
from
a
territorial
to
a
state
government
the
question
has
been
fairly
and
explicitly
referred
to
the
people
whether
they
will
have
a
constitution
with

or
without
slavery
it
declares
that
before
the
constitution
adopted
by
the
convention
shall
be
sent
to
congress
for
admission
into
the
union
as
a
state
an
election
shall
be
held
to
decide
this
question
at
which
all
the
white
male
inhabitants
of
the
territory
above
the
age
of
are
entitled
to
vote
they
are
to
vote
by
ballot
and
the
ballots
cast
at
said
election
shall
be
indorsed
constitution
with
slavery
and
constitution
with
no
slavery
if
there
be
a
majority
in
favor
of
the
constitution
with
slavery
then
it
is
to
be
transmitted
to
congress
by
the
president
of
the
convention
in
its
original
form
if
on
the
contrary
there
shall
be
a
majority
in
favor
of
the
constitution
with
no
slavery
then
the
article
providing
for
slavery
shall
be
stricken
from
the
constitution
by
the
president
of
this
convention
and
it
is
expressly
declared
that
no
slavery
shall
exist
in
the
state
of
kansas
except
that
the
right
of
property
in
slaves
now
in
the
territory
shall
in
no
manner
be
interfered
with
and
in
that
event
it
is
made
his
duty
to
have
the
constitution
thus
ratified
transmitted
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
the
admission
of
the
state
into
the
union
at
this
election
every
citizen
will
have
an
opportunity
of
expressing
his
opinion
by
his
vote
whether
kansas
shall
be
received
into
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
and
thus
this
exciting
question
may
be
peacefully
settled
in
the
very
mode
required
by
the
organic
law
the
election
will
be
held
under
legitimate
authority
and
if
any
portion
of
the
inhabitants
shall
refuse
to
vote
a
fair
opportunity
to
do
so
having
been
presented
this
will
be
their
own
voluntary
act
and
they
alone
will
be
responsible
for
the
consequences
whether
kansas
shall
be
a
free
or
a
slave
state
must
eventually
under
some
authority
be
decided
by
an
election
and
the
question
can
never
be
more
clearly
or
distinctly
presented
to
the
people
than
it
is
at
the
present
moment
should
this
opportunity
be
rejected
she
may
be
involved
for
years
in
domestic
discord
and
possibly
in
civil
war
before
she
can
again
make
up
the
issue
now
so
fortunately
tendered
and
again
reach
the
point
she
has
already
attained
kansas
has
for
some
years
occupied
too
much
of
the
public
attention
it
is
high
time
this
should
be
directed
to
far
more
important
objects
when
once
admitted
into
the
union
whether
with
or
without
slavery
the
excitement
beyond
her
own
limits
will
speedily
pass
away
and
she
will
then
for
the
first
time
be
left
as
she
ought
to
have
been
long
since
to
manage
her
own
affairs
in
her
own
way
if
her
constitution
on
the
subject
of
slavery
or
on
any
other
subject
be
displeasing
to
a
majority
of
the
people
no
human
power
can
prevent
them
from
changing
it
within
a
brief
period
under
these
circumstances
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
the
peace
and
quiet
of
the
whole
country
are
not
of
greater
importance
than
the
mere
temporary
triumph
of
either
of
the
political
parties
in
kansas
should
the
constitution
without
slavery
be
adopted
by
the
votes
of
the
majority
the
rights
of
property
in
slaves
now
in
the
territory
are
reserved
the
number
of
these
is
very
small
but
if
it
were
greater
the
provision
would
be
equally
just
and
reasonable
the
slaves
were
brought
into
the
territory
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
are
now
the
property
of
their
masters
this
point
has
at
length
been
finally
decided
by
the
highest
judicial
tribunal
of
the
country
and
this
upon
the
plain
principle
that
when
a
confederacy
of
sovereign
states
acquire
a
new
territory
at
their
joint
expense
both
equality
and
justice
demand
that
the
citizens
of
one
and
all
of
them
shall
have
the
right
to
take
into
it
whatsoever
is
recognized
as
property
by
the
common
constitution
to
have
summarily
confiscated
the
property
in
slaves
already
in
the
territory
would
have
been
an
act
of
gross
injustice
and
contrary
to
the
practice
of
the
older
states
of
the
union
which
have
abolished
slavery
a
territorial
government
was
established
for
utah
by
act
of
congress
approved
the
th
september
and
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
were
thereby
extended
over
it
so
far
as
the
same
or
any
provisions
thereof
may
be
applicable
this
act
provided
for
the
appointment
by
the
president
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
of
a
governor
who
was
to
be
ex
officio
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
a
secretary
three
judges
of
the
supreme
court
a
marshal
and
a
district
attorney
subsequent
acts
provided
for
the
appointment
of
the
officers
necessary
to
extend
our
land
and
our
indian
system
over
the
territory
brigham
young
was
appointed
the
first
governor
on
the
th
september
and
has
held
the
office
ever
since
whilst
governor
young
has
been
both
governor
and
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
throughout
this
period
he
has
been
at
the
same
time
the
head
of
the
church
called
the
latterday
saints
and
professes
to
govern
its
members
and
dispose
of
their
property
by
direct
inspiration
and
authority
from
the
almighty
his
power
has
been
therefore
absolute
over
both
church
and
state
the
people
of
utah
almost
exclusively
belong
to
this
church
and
believing
with
a
fanatical
spirit
that
he
is
governor
of
the
territory
by
divine
appointment
they
obey
his
commands
as
if
these
were
direct
revelations
from
heaven
if
therefore
he
chooses
that
his
government
shall
come
into
collision
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
members
of
the
mormon
church
will
yield
implicit
obedience
to
his
will
unfortunately
existing
facts
leave
but
little
doubt
that
such
is
his
determination
without
entering
upon
a
minute
history
of
occurrences
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
all
the
officers
of
the
united
states
judicial
and
executive
with
the
single
exception
of
two
indian
agents
have
found
it
necessary
for
their
own
personal
safety
to
withdraw
from
the
territory
and
there
no
longer
remains
any
government
in
utah
but
the
despotism
of
brigham
young
this
being
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
territory
i
could
not
mistake
the
path
of
duty
as
chief
executive
magistrate
i
was
bound
to
restore
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution
and
laws
within
its
limits
in
order
to
effect
this
purpose
i
appointed
a
new
governor
and
other
federal
officers
for
utah
and
sent
with
them
a
military
force
for
their
protection
and
to
aid
as
a
posse
comitatus
in
case
of
need
in
the
execution
of
the
laws
with
the
religious
opinions
of
the
mormons
as
long
as
they
remained
mere
opinions
however
deplorable
in
themselves
and
revolting
to
the
moral
and
religious
sentiments
of
all
christendom
i
had
no
right
to
interfere
actions
alone
when
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
become
the
legitimate
subjects
for
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
magistrate
my
instructions
to
governor
cumming
have
therefore
been
framed
in
strict
accordance
with
these
principles
at
their
date
a
hope
was
indulged
that
no
necessity
might
exist
for
employing
the
military
in
restoring
and
maintaining
the
authority
of
the
law
but
this
hope
has
now
vanished
governor
young
has
by
proclamation
declared
his
determination
to
maintain
his
power
by
force
and
has
already
committed
acts
of
hostility
against
the
united
states
unless
he
should
retrace
his
steps
the
territory
of
utah
will
be
in
a
state
of
open
rebellion
he
has
committed
these
acts
of
hostility
notwithstanding
major
van
vliet
an
officer
of
the
army
sent
to
utah
by
the
commanding
general
to
purchase
provisions
for
the
troops
had
given
him
the
strongest
assurances
of
the
peaceful
intentions
of
the
government
and
that
the
troops
would
only
be
employed
as
a
posse
comitatus
when
called
on
by
the
civil
authority
to
aid
in
the
execution
of
the
laws
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
governor
young
has
long
contemplated
this
result
he
knows
that
the
continuance
of
his
despotic
power
depends
upon
the
exclusion
of
all
settlers
from
the
territory
except
those
who
will
acknowledge
his
divine
mission
and
implicitly
obey
his
will
and
that
an
enlightened
public
opinion
there
would
soon
prostrate
institutions
at
war
with
the
laws
both
of
god
and
man
he
has
therefore
for
several
years
in
order
to
maintain
his
independence
been
industriously
employed
in
collecting
and
fabricating
arms
and
munitions
of
war
and
in
disciplining
the
mormons
for
military
service
as
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
he
has
had
an
opportunity
of
tampering
with
the
indian
tribes
and
exciting
their
hostile
feelings
against
the
united
states
this
according
to
our
information
he
has
accomplished
in
regard
to
some
of
these
tribes
while
others
have
remained
true
to
their
allegiance
and
have
communicated
his
intrigues
to
our
indian
agents
he
has
laid
in
a
store
of
provisions
for
three
years
which
in
case
of
necessity
as
he
informed
major
van
vliet
he
will
conceal
and
then
take
to
the
mountains
and
bid
defiance
to
all
the
powers
of
the
government
a
great
part
of
all
this
may
be
idle
boasting
but
yet
no
wise
government
will
lightly
estimate
the
efforts
which
may
be
inspired
by
such
frenzied
fanaticism
as
exists
among
the
mormons
in
utah
this
is
the
first
rebellion
which
has
existed
in
our
territories
and
humanity
itself
requires
that
we
should
put
it
down
in
such
a
manner
that
it
shall
be
the
last
to
trifle
with
it
would
be
to
encourage
it
and
to
render
it
formidable
we
ought
to
go
there
with
such
an
imposing
force
as
to
convince
these
deluded
people
that
resistance
would
be
vain
and
thus
spare
the
effusion
of
blood
we
can
in
this
manner
best
convince
them
that
we
are
their
friends
not
their
enemies
in
order
to
accomplish
this
object
it
will
be
necessary
according
to
the
estimate
of
the
war
department
to
raise
four
additional
regiments
and
this
i
earnestly
recommend
to
congress
at
the
present
moment
of
depression
in
the
revenues
of
the
country
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
recommend
such
a
measure
but
i
feel
confident
of
the
support
of
congress
cost
what
it
may
in
suppressing
the
insurrection
and
in
restoring
and
maintaining
the
sovereignty
of
the
constitution
and
laws
over
the
territory
of
utah
i
recommend
to
congress
the
establishment
of
a
ter
ritorial
government
over
arizona
incorporating
with
it
such
portions
of
new
mexico
as
they
may
deem
expedient
i
need
scarcely
adduce
arguments
in
support
of
this
recommendation
we
are
bound
to
protect
the
lives
and
the
property
of
our
citizens
inhabiting
arizona
and
these
are
now
without
any
efficient
protection
their
present
number
is
already
considerable
and
is
rapidly
increasing
notwithstanding
the
disadvantages
under
which
they
labor
besides
the
proposed
territory
is
believed
to
be
rich
in
mineral
and
agricultural
resources
especially
in
silver
and
copper
the
mails
of
the
united
states
to
california
are
now
carried
over
it
throughout
its
whole
extent
and
this
route
is
known
to
be
the
nearest
and
believed
to
be
the
best
to
the
pacific
long
experience
has
deeply
convinced
me
that
a
strict
construction
of
the
powers
granted
to
congress
is
the
only
true
as
well
as
the
only
safe
theory
of
the
constitution
whilst
this
principle
shall
guide
my
public
conduct
i
consider
it
clear
that
under
the
warmaking
power
congress
may
appropriate
money
for
the
construction
of
a
military
road
through
the
territories
of
the
united
states
when
this
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
defense
of
any
of
the
states
against
foreign
invasion
the
constitution
has
conferred
upon
congress
power
to
declare
war
to
raise
and
support
armies
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy
and
to
call
forth
the
militia
to
repel
invasions
these
high
sovereign
powers
necessarily
involve
important
and
responsible
public
duties
and
among
them
there
is
none
so
sacred
and
so
imperative
as
that
of
preserving
our
soil
from
the
invasion
of
a
foreign
enemy
the
constitution
has
therefore
left
nothing
on
this
point
to
construction
but
expressly
requires
that
the
united
states
shall
protect
each
of
them
the
states
against
invasion
now
if
a
military
road
over
our
own
territories
be
indispensably
necessary
to
enable
us
to
meet
and
repel
the
invader
it
follows
as
a
necessary
consequence
not
only
that
we
possess
the
power
but
it
is
our
imperative
duty
to
construct
such
a
road
it
would
be
an
absurdity
to
invest
a
government
with
the
unlimited
power
to
make
and
conduct
war
and
at
the
same
time
deny
to
it
the
only
means
of
reaching
and
defeating
the
enemy
at
the
frontier
without
such
a
road
it
is
quite
evident
we
can
not
protect
california
and
our
pacific
possessions
against
invasion
we
can
not
by
any
other
means
transport
men
and
munitions
of
war
from
the
atlantic
states
in
sufficient
time
successfully
to
defend
these
remote
and
distant
portions
of
the
republic
experience
has
proved
that
the
routes
across
the
isthmus
of
central
america
are
at
best
but
a
very
uncertain
and
unreliable
mode
of
communication
but
even
if
this
were
not
the
case
they
would
at
once
be
closed
against
us
in
the
event
of
war
with
a
naval
power
so
much
stronger
than
our
own
as
to
enable
it
to
blockade
the
ports
at
either
end
of
these
routes
after
all
therefore
we
can
only
rely
upon
a
military
road
through
our
own
territories
and
ever
since
the
origin
of
the
government
congress
has
been
in
the
practice
of
appropriating
money
from
the
public
treasury
for
the
construction
of
such
roads
the
difficulties
and
the
expense
of
constructing
a
military
railroad
to
connect
our
atlantic
and
pacific
states
have
been
greatly
exaggerated
the
distance
on
the
arizona
route
near
the
thirtysecond
parallel
of
north
latitude
between
the
western
boundary
of
texas
on
the
rio
grande
and
the
eastern
boundary
of
california
on
the
colorado
from
the
best
explorations
now
within
our
knowledge
does
not
exceed
miles
and
the
face
of
the
country
is
in
the
main
favorable
for
obvious
reasons
the
government
ought
not
to
undertake
the
work
itself
by
means
of
its
own
agents
this
ought
to
be
committed
to
other
agencies
which
congress
might
assist
either
by
grants
of
land
or
money
or
by
both
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
they
may
deem
most
beneficial
for
the
country
provision
might
thus
be
made
not
only
for
the
safe
rapid
and
economical
transportation
of
troops
and
munitions
of
war
but
also
of
the
public
mails
the
commercial
interests
of
the
whole
country
both
east
and
west
would
be
greatly
promoted
by
such
a
road
and
above
all
it
would
be
a
powerful
additional
bond
of
union
and
although
advantages
of
this
kind
whether
postal
commercial
or
political
can
not
confer
constitutional
power
yet
they
may
furnish
auxiliary
arguments
in
favor
of
expediting
a
work
which
in
my
judgment
is
clearly
embraced
within
the
warmaking
power
for
these
reasons
i
commend
to
the
friendly
consideration
of
congress
the
subject
of
the
pacific
railroad
without
finally
committing
myself
to
any
particular
route
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
furnish
a
detailed
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
public
finances
and
of
the
respective
branches
of
the
public
service
devolved
upon
that
department
of
the
government
by
this
report
it
appears
that
the
amount
of
revenue
received
from
all
sources
into
the
treasury
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
the
th
june
was
which
amount
with
the
balance
of
remaining
in
the
treasury
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
made
an
aggregate
for
the
service
of
the
year
of
the
public
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
th
june
amounted
to
of
which
were
applied
to
the
redemption
of
the
public
debt
including
interest
and
premium
leaving
in
the
treasury
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
fiscal
year
on
the
st
july
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
fiscal
year
commencing
st
july
were
and
the
estimated
receipts
of
the
remaining
three
quarters
to
the
th
june
are
making
with
the
balance
before
stated
an
aggregate
of
for
the
service
of
the
present
fiscal
year
the
actual
expenditures
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
fiscal
year
were
of
which
were
applied
to
the
redemption
of
the
public
debt
including
interest
and
premium
the
probable
expenditures
of
the
remaining
three
quarters
to
th
june
are
including
interest
on
the
public
debt
making
an
aggregate
of
leaving
an
estimated
balance
in
the
treasury
at
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
of
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
fiscal
year
was
the
amount
redeemed
since
the
st
of
july
was
leaving
a
balance
unredeemed
at
this
time
of
the
amount
of
estimated
expenditures
for
the
remaining
three
quarters
of
the
present
fiscal
year
will
in
all
probability
be
increased
from
the
causes
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
his
suggestion
therefore
that
authority
should
be
given
to
supply
any
temporary
deficiency
by
the
issue
of
a
limited
amount
of
treasury
notes
is
approved
and
i
accordingly
recommend
the
passage
of
such
a
law
as
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
the
tariff
of
march
has
been
in
operation
for
so
short
a
period
of
time
and
under
circumstances
so
unfavorable
to
a
just
development
of
its
results
as
a
revenue
measure
that
i
should
regard
it
as
inexpedient
at
least
for
the
present
to
undertake
its
revision
i
transmit
herewith
the
reports
made
to
me
by
the
secretaries
of
war
and
of
the
navy
of
the
interior
and
of
the
postmastergeneral
they
all
contain
valuable
and
important
information
and
suggestions
which
i
commend
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
i
have
already
recommended
the
raising
of
four
additional
regiments
and
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
presents
strong
reasons
proving
this
increase
of
the
army
under
existing
circumstances
to
be
indispensable
i
would
call
the
special
attention
of
congress
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
favor
of
the
construction
of
ten
small
war
steamers
of
light
draft
for
some
years
the
government
has
been
obliged
on
many
occasions
to
hire
such
steamers
from
individuals
to
supply
its
pressing
wants
at
the
present
moment
we
have
no
armed
vessel
in
the
navy
which
can
penetrate
the
rivers
of
china
we
have
but
few
which
can
enter
any
of
the
harbors
south
of
norfolk
although
many
millions
of
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
annually
pass
in
and
out
of
these
harbors
some
of
our
most
valuable
interests
and
most
vulnerable
points
are
thus
left
exposed
this
class
of
vessels
of
light
draft
great
speed
and
heavy
guns
would
be
formidable
in
coast
defense
the
cost
of
their
construction
will
not
be
great
and
they
will
require
but
a
comparatively
small
expenditure
to
keep
them
in
commission
in
time
of
peace
they
will
prove
as
effective
as
much
larger
vessels
and
more
useful
one
of
them
should
be
at
every
station
where
we
maintain
a
squadron
and
three
or
four
should
be
constantly
employed
on
our
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
economy
utility
and
efficiency
combine
to
recommend
them
as
almost
indispensable
ten
of
these
small
vessels
would
be
of
incalculable
advantage
to
the
naval
service
and
the
whole
cost
of
their
construction
would
not
exceed
or
each
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
worthy
of
grave
consideration
it
treats
of
the
numerous
important
and
diversified
branches
of
domestic
administration
intrusted
to
him
by
law
among
these
the
most
prominent
are
the
public
lands
and
our
relations
with
the
indians
our
system
for
the
disposal
of
the
public
lands
originating
with
the
fathers
of
the
republic
has
been
improved
as
experience
pointed
the
way
and
gradually
adapted
to
the
growth
and
settlement
of
our
western
states
and
territories
it
has
worked
well
in
practice
already
thirteen
states
and
seven
territories
have
been
carved
out
of
these
lands
and
still
more
than
a
thousand
millions
of
acres
remain
unsold
what
a
boundless
prospect
this
presents
to
our
country
of
future
prosperity
and
power
we
have
heretofore
disposed
of
acres
of
the
public
land
whilst
the
public
lands
as
a
source
of
revenue
are
of
great
importance
their
importance
is
far
greater
as
furnishing
homes
for
a
hardy
and
independent
race
of
honest
and
industrious
citizens
who
desire
to
subdue
and
cultivate
the
soil
they
ought
to
be
administered
mainly
with
a
view
of
promoting
this
wise
and
benevolent
policy
in
appropriating
them
for
any
other
purpose
we
ought
to
use
even
greater
economy
than
if
they
had
be
en
converted
into
money
and
the
proceeds
were
already
in
the
public
treasury
to
squander
away
this
richest
and
noblest
inheritance
which
any
people
have
ever
enjoyed
upon
objects
of
doubtful
constitutionality
or
expediency
would
be
to
violate
one
of
the
most
important
trusts
ever
committed
to
any
people
whilst
i
do
not
deny
to
congress
the
power
when
acting
bona
fide
as
a
proprietor
to
give
away
portions
of
them
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
value
of
the
remainder
yet
considering
the
great
temptation
to
abuse
this
power
we
can
not
be
too
cautious
in
its
exercise
actual
settlers
under
existing
laws
are
protected
against
other
purchasers
at
the
public
sales
in
their
right
of
preemption
to
the
extent
of
a
quarter
section
or
acres
of
land
the
remainder
may
then
be
disposed
of
at
public
or
entered
at
private
sale
in
unlimited
quantities
speculation
has
of
late
years
prevailed
to
a
great
extent
in
the
public
lands
the
consequence
has
been
that
large
portions
of
them
have
become
the
property
of
individuals
and
companies
and
thus
the
price
is
greatly
enhanced
to
those
who
desire
to
purchase
for
actual
settlement
in
order
to
limit
the
area
of
speculation
as
much
as
possible
the
extinction
of
the
indian
title
and
the
extension
of
the
public
surveys
ought
only
to
keep
pace
with
the
tide
of
emigration
if
congress
should
hereafter
grant
alternate
sections
to
states
or
companies
as
they
have
done
heretofore
i
recommend
that
the
intermediate
sections
retained
by
the
government
should
be
subject
to
preemption
by
actual
settlers
it
ought
ever
to
be
our
cardinal
policy
to
reserve
the
public
lands
as
much
as
may
be
for
actual
settlers
and
this
at
moderate
prices
we
shall
thus
not
only
best
promote
the
prosperity
of
the
new
states
and
territories
and
the
power
of
the
union
but
shall
secure
homes
for
our
posterity
for
many
generations
the
extension
of
our
limits
has
brought
within
our
jurisdiction
many
additional
and
populous
tribes
of
indians
a
large
proportion
of
which
are
wild
untractable
and
difficult
to
control
predatory
and
warlike
in
their
disposition
and
habits
it
is
impossible
altogether
to
restrain
them
from
committing
aggressions
on
each
other
as
well
as
upon
our
frontier
citizens
and
those
emigrating
to
our
distant
states
and
territories
hence
expensive
military
expeditions
are
frequently
necessary
to
overawe
and
chastise
the
more
lawless
and
hostile
the
present
system
of
making
them
valuable
presents
to
influence
them
to
remain
at
peace
has
proved
ineffectual
it
is
believed
to
be
the
better
policy
to
colonize
them
in
suitable
localities
where
they
can
receive
the
rudiments
of
education
and
be
gradually
induced
to
adopt
habits
of
industry
so
far
as
the
experiment
has
been
tried
it
has
worked
well
in
practice
and
it
will
doubtless
prove
to
be
less
expensive
than
the
present
system
the
whole
number
of
indians
within
our
territorial
limits
is
believed
to
be
from
the
best
data
in
the
interior
department
about
the
tribes
of
cherokees
choctaws
chickasaws
and
creeks
settled
in
the
territory
set
apart
for
them
west
of
arkansas
are
rapidly
advancing
in
education
and
in
all
the
arts
of
civilization
and
selfgovernment
and
we
may
indulge
the
agreeable
anticipation
that
at
no
very
distant
day
they
will
be
incorporated
into
the
union
as
one
of
the
sovereign
states
it
will
be
seen
from
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
that
the
postoffice
department
still
continues
to
depend
on
the
treasury
as
it
has
been
compelled
to
do
for
several
years
past
for
an
important
portion
of
the
means
of
sustaining
and
extending
its
operations
their
rapid
growth
and
expansion
are
shown
by
a
decennial
statement
of
the
number
of
postoffices
and
the
length
of
postroads
commencing
with
the
year
in
that
year
there
were
postoffices
in
in
and
in
they
number
in
this
year
postoffices
have
been
established
and
discontinued
leaving
a
net
increase
of
the
postmasters
of
offices
are
appointed
by
the
president
the
length
of
postroads
in
was
miles
in
miles
in
miles
and
in
the
year
there
are
miles
of
postroad
including
miles
of
railroad
on
which
the
mails
are
transported
the
expenditures
of
the
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
june
as
adjusted
by
the
auditor
amounted
to
to
defray
these
expenditures
there
was
to
the
credit
of
the
department
on
the
st
july
the
sum
of
the
gross
revenue
of
the
year
including
the
annual
allowances
for
the
transportation
of
free
mail
matter
produced
and
the
remainder
was
supplied
by
the
appropriation
from
the
treasury
of
granted
by
the
act
of
congress
approved
august
and
by
the
appropriation
of
made
by
the
act
of
march
leaving
to
be
carried
to
the
credit
of
the
department
in
the
accounts
of
the
current
year
i
commend
to
your
consideration
the
report
of
the
department
in
relation
to
the
establishment
of
the
overland
mail
route
from
the
mississippi
river
to
san
francisco
cal
the
route
was
selected
with
my
full
concurrence
as
the
one
in
my
judgment
best
calculated
to
attain
the
important
objects
contemplated
by
congress
the
late
disastrous
monetary
revulsion
may
have
one
good
effect
should
it
cause
both
the
government
and
the
people
to
return
to
the
practice
of
a
wise
and
judicious
economy
both
in
public
and
private
expenditures
an
overflowing
treasury
has
led
to
habits
of
prodigality
and
extravagance
in
our
legislation
it
has
induced
congress
to
make
large
appropriations
to
objects
for
which
they
never
would
have
provided
had
it
been
necessary
to
raise
the
amount
of
revenue
required
to
meet
them
by
increased
taxation
or
by
loans
we
are
now
compelled
to
pause
in
our
career
and
to
scrutinize
our
expenditures
with
the
utmost
vigilance
and
in
performing
this
duty
i
pledge
my
cooperation
to
the
extent
of
my
constitutional
competency
it
ought
to
be
observed
at
the
same
time
that
true
public
economy
does
not
consist
in
withholding
the
means
necessary
to
accomplish
important
national
objects
intrusted
to
us
by
the
constitution
and
especially
such
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
common
defense
in
the
present
crisis
of
the
country
it
is
our
duty
to
confine
our
appropriations
to
objects
of
this
character
unless
in
cases
where
justice
to
individuals
may
demand
a
different
course
in
all
cases
care
ought
to
be
taken
that
the
money
granted
by
congress
shall
be
faithfully
and
economically
applied
under
the
federal
constitution
every
bill
which
shall
have
passed
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
shall
before
it
become
a
law
be
approved
and
signed
by
the
president
and
if
not
approved
he
shall
return
it
with
his
objections
to
that
house
in
which
it
shall
have
originated
in
order
to
perform
this
high
and
responsible
duty
sufficient
time
must
be
allowed
the
president
to
read
and
examine
every
bill
presented
to
him
for
approval
unless
this
be
afforded
the
constitution
becomes
a
dead
letter
in
this
particular
and
even
worse
it
becomes
a
means
of
deception
our
constituents
seeing
the
presidents
approval
and
signature
attached
to
each
act
of
congress
are
induced
to
believe
that
he
has
actually
performed
his
duty
when
in
truth
nothing
is
in
many
cases
more
unfounded
from
the
practice
of
congress
such
an
examination
of
each
bill
as
the
constitution
requires
has
been
rendered
impossible
the
most
important
business
of
each
session
is
generally
crowded
into
its
last
hours
and
the
alternative
presented
to
the
president
is
either
to
violate
the
constitutional
duty
which
he
owes
to
the
people
and
approve
bills
which
for
want
of
time
it
is
impossible
he
should
have
examined
or
by
his
refusal
to
do
this
subject
the
country
and
individuals
to
great
loss
and
inconvenience
besides
a
practice
has
grown
up
of
late
years
to
legislate
in
appropriation
bills
at
the
last
hours
of
the
session
on
new
and
important
subjects
this
practice
constrains
the
president
either
to
suffer
measures
to
become
laws
which
he
does
not
approve
or
to
incur
the
risk
of
stopping
the
wheels
of
the
government
by
vetoing
an
appropriation
bill
formerly
such
bills
were
confined
to
specific
appropriations
for
carrying
into
effect
existing
laws
and
the
wellestablished
policy
of
the
country
and
little
time
was
then
requited
by
the
president
for
their
examination
for
my
own
part
i
have
deliberately
determined
that
i
shall
approve
no
bills
which
i
have
not
examined
and
it
will
be
a
case
of
extreme
and
most
urgent
necessity
which
shall
ever
induce
me
to
depart
from
this
rule
i
therefore
respectfully
but
earnestly
recommend
that
the
two
houses
would
allow
the
president
at
least
two
days
previous
to
the
adjournment
of
each
session
within
which
no
new
bill
shall
be
presented
to
him
for
approval
under
the
existing
joint
rule
one
day
is
allowed
but
this
rule
has
been
hitherto
so
constantly
suspended
in
practice
that
important
bills
continue
to
be
presented
to
him
up
till
the
very
last
moments
of
the
session
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
no
great
public
inconvenience
can
arise
from
the
want
of
time
to
examine
their
provisions
because
the
constitution
has
declared
that
if
a
bill
be
presented
to
the
president
within
the
last
ten
days
of
the
session
he
is
not
required
to
return
it
either
with
an
approval
or
with
a
veto
in
which
case
it
shall
not
be
a
law
it
may
then
lie
over
and
be
taken
up
and
passed
at
the
next
session
great
inconvenience
would
only
be
experienced
in
regard
to
appropriation
bills
but
fortunately
under
the
late
excellent
law
allowing
a
salary
instead
of
a
per
diem
to
members
of
congress
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
a
called
session
will
be
greatly
reduced
i
can
not
conclude
without
commending
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
interest
of
the
people
of
this
district
without
a
representative
on
the
floor
of
congress
they
have
for
this
very
reason
peculiar
claims
upon
our
just
regard
to
this
i
know
from
my
long
acquaintance
with
them
they
are
eminently
entitled

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
constitution
requires
that
the
president
shall
from
time
to
time
not
only
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
such
measures
as
he
may
judge
necessary
and
expedient
but
also
that
he
shall
give
information
to
them
of
the
state
of
the
union
to
do
this
fully
involves
exposition
of
all
matters
in
the
actual
condition
of
the
country
domestic
or
foreign
which
essentially
concern
the
general
welfare
while
performing
his
constitutional
duty
in
this
respect
the
president
does
not
speak
merely
to
express
personal
convictions
but
as
the
executive
minister
of
the
government
enabled
by
his
position
and
called
upon
by
his
official
obligations
to
scan
with
an
impartial
eye
the
interests
of
the
whole
and
of
every
part
of
the
united
states
of
the
condition
of
the
domestic
interests
of
the
unionits
agriculture
mines
manufactures
navigation
and
commerceit
is
necessary
only
to
say
that
the
internal
prosperity
of
the
country
its
continuous
and
steady
advancement
in
wealth
and
population
and
in
private
as
well
as
public
wellbeing
attest
the
wisdom
of
our
institutions
and
the
predominant
spirit
of
intelligence
and
patriotism
which
notwithstanding
occasional
irregularities
of
opinion
or
action
resulting
from
popular
freedom
has
distinguished
and
characterized
the
people
of
america
in
the
brief
interval
between
the
termination
of
the
last
and
the
commencement
of
the
present
session
of
congress
the
public
mind
has
been
occupied
with
the
care
of
selecting
for
another
constitutional
term
the
president
and
vicepresident
of
the
united
states
the
determination
of
the
persons
who
are
of
right
or
contingently
to
preside
over
the
administration
of
the
government
is
under
our
system
committed
to
the
states
and
the
people
we
appeal
to
them
by
their
voice
pronounced
in
the
forms
of
law
to
call
whomsoever
they
will
to
the
high
post
of
chief
magistrate
and
thus
it
is
that
as
the
senators
represent
the
respective
states
of
the
union
and
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
several
constituencies
of
each
state
so
the
president
represents
the
aggregate
population
of
the
united
states
their
election
of
him
is
the
explicit
and
solemn
act
of
the
sole
sovereign
authority
of
the
union
it
is
impossible
to
misapprehend
the
great
principles
which
by
their
recent
political
action
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
sanctioned
and
announced
they
have
asserted
the
constitutional
equality
of
each
and
all
of
the
states
of
the
union
as
states
they
have
affirmed
the
constitutional
equality
of
each
and
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
citizens
whatever
their
religion
wherever
their
birth
or
their
residence
they
have
maintained
the
inviolability
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
different
sections
of
the
union
and
they
have
proclaimed
their
devoted
and
unalterable
attachment
to
the
union
and
to
the
constitution
as
objects
of
interest
superior
to
all
subjects
of
local
or
sectional
controversy
as
the
safeguard
of
the
rights
of
all
as
the
spirit
and
the
essence
of
the
liberty
peace
and
greatness
of
the
republic
in
doing
this
they
have
at
the
same
time
emphatically
condemned
the
idea
of
organizing
in
these
united
states
mere
geographical
parties
of
marshaling
in
hostile
array
toward
each
other
the
different
parts
of
the
country
north
or
south
east
or
west
schemes
of
this
nature
fraught
with
incalculable
mischief
and
which
the
considerate
sense
of
the
people
has
rejected
could
have
had
countenance
in
no
part
of
the
country
had
they
not
been
disguised
by
suggestions
plausible
in
appearance
acting
upon
an
excited
state
of
the
public
mind
induced
by
causes
temporary
in
their
character
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
transient
in
their
influence
perfect
liberty
of
association
for
political
objects
and
the
widest
scope
of
discussion
are
the
received
and
ordinary
conditions
of
government
in
our
country
our
institutions
framed
in
the
spirit
of
confidence
in
the
intelligence
and
integrity
of
the
people
do
not
forbid
citizens
either
individually
or
associated
together
to
attack
by
writing
speech
or
any
other
methods
short
of
physical
force
the
constitution
and
the
very
existence
of
the
union
under
the
shelter
of
this
great
liberty
and
protected
by
the
laws
and
usages
of
the
government
they
assail
associations
have
been
formed
in
some
of
the
states
of
individuals
who
pretending
to
seek
only
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
institution
of
slavery
into
the
present
or
future
inchoate
states
of
the
union
are
really
inflamed
with
desire
to
change
the
domestic
institutions
of
existing
states
to
accomplish
their
objects
they
dedicate
themselves
to
the
odious
task
of
depreciating
the
government
organization
which
stands
in
their
way
and
of
calumniating
with
indiscriminate
invective
not
only
the
citizens
of
particular
states
with
whose
laws
they
find
fault
but
all
others
of
their
fellow
citizens
throughout
the
country
who
do
not
participate
with
them
in
their
assaults
upon
the
constitution
framed
and
adopted
by
our
fathers
and
claiming
for
the
privileges
it
has
secured
and
the
blessings
it
has
conferred
the
steady
support
and
grateful
reverence
of
their
children
they
seek
an
object
which
they
well
know
to
be
a
revolutionary
one
they
are
perfectly
aware
that
the
change
in
the
relative
condition
of
the
white
and
black
races
in
the
slaveholding
states
which
they
would
promote
is
beyond
their
lawful
authority
that
to
them
it
is
a
foreign
object
that
it
can
not
be
effected
by
any
peaceful
instrumentality
of
theirs
that
for
them
and
the
states
of
which
they
are
citizens
the
only
path
to
its
accomplishment
is
through
burning
cities
and
ravaged
fields
and
slaughtered
populations
and
all
there
is
most
terrible
in
foreign
complicated
with
civil
and
servile
war
and
that
the
first
step
in
the
attempt
is
the
forcible
disruption
of
a
country
embracing
in
its
broad
bosom
a
degree
of
liberty
and
an
amount
of
individual
and
public
prosperity
to
which
there
is
no
parallel
in
history
and
substituting
in
its
place
hostile
governments
driven
at
once
and
inevitably
into
mutual
devastation
and
fratricidal
carnage
transforming
the
now
peaceful
and
felicitous
brotherhood
into
a
vast
permanent
camp
of
armed
men
like
the
rival
monarchies
of
europe
and
asia
well
knowing
that
such
and
such
only
are
the
means
and
the
consequences
of
their
plans
and
purposes
they
endeavor
to
prepare
the
people
of
the
united
states
for
civil
war
by
doing
everything
in
their
power
to
deprive
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
moral
authority
and
to
undermine
the
fabric
of
the
union
by
appeals
to
passion
and
sectional
prejudice
by
indoctrinating
its
people
with
reciprocal
hatred
and
by
educating
them
to
stand
face
to
face
as
enemies
rather
than
shoulder
to
shoulder
as
friends
it
is
by
the
agency
of
such
unwarrantable
interference
foreign
and
domestic
that
the
minds
of
many
otherwise
good
citizens
have
been
so
inflamed
into
the
passionate
condemnation
of
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
southern
states
as
at
length
to
pass
insensibly
to
almost
equally
passion
late
hostility
toward
their
fellowcitizens
of
those
states
and
thus
finally
to
fall
into
temporary
fellowship
with
the
avowed
and
active
enemies
of
the
constitution
ardently
attached
to
liberty
in
the
abstract
they
do
not
stop
to
consider
practically
how
the
objects
they
would
attain
can
be
accomplished
nor
to
reflect
that
even
if
the
evil
were
as
great
as
they
deem
it
they
have
no
remedy
to
apply
and
that
it
can
be
only
aggravated
by
their
violence
and
unconstitutional
action
a
question
which
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
problems
of
social
institution
political
economy
and
statesmanship
they
treat
with
unreasoning
intemperance
of
thought
and
language
extremes
beget
extremes
violent
attack
from
the
north
finds
its
inevitable
consequence
in
the
growth
of
a
spirit
of
angry
defiance
at
the
south
thus
in
the
progress
of
events
we
had
reached
that
consummation
which
the
voice
of
the
people
has
now
so
pointedly
rebuked
of
the
attempt
of
a
portion
of
the
states
by
a
sectional
organization
and
movement
to
usurp
the
control
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
i
confidently
believe
that
the
great
body
of
those
who
inconsiderately
took
this
fatal
step
are
sincerely
attached
to
the
constitution
and
the
union
they
would
upon
deliberation
shrink
with
unaffected
horror
from
any
conscious
act
of
disunion
or
civil
war
but
they
have
entered
into
a
path
which
leads
nowhere
unless
it
be
to
civil
war
and
disunion
and
which
has
no
other
possible
outlet
they
have
proceeded
thus
far
in
that
direction
in
consequence
of
the
successive
stages
of
their
progress
having
consisted
of
a
series
of
secondary
issues
each
of
which
professed
to
be
confined
within
constitutional
and
peaceful
limits
but
which
attempted
indirectly
what
few
men
were
willing
to
do
directly
that
is
to
act
aggressively
against
the
constitutional
rights
of
nearly
onehalf
of
the
thirtyone
states
in
the
long
series
of
acts
of
indirect
aggression
the
first
was
the
strenuous
agitation
by
citizens
of
the
northern
states
in
congress
and
out
of
it
of
the
question
of
negro
emancipation
in
the
southern
states
the
second
step
in
this
path
of
evil
consisted
of
acts
of
the
people
of
the
northern
states
and
in
several
instances
of
their
governments
aimed
to
facilitate
the
escape
of
persons
held
to
service
in
the
southern
states
and
to
prevent
their
extradition
when
reclaimed
according
to
law
and
in
virtue
of
express
provisions
of
the
constitution
to
promote
this
object
legislative
enactments
and
other
means
were
adopted
to
take
away
or
defeat
rights
which
the
constitution
solemnly
guaranteed
in
order
to
nullify
the
then
existing
act
of
congress
concerning
the
extradition
of
fugitives
from
service
laws
were
enacted
in
many
states
forbidding
their
officers
under
the
severest
penalties
to
participate
in
the
execution
of
any
act
of
congress
whatever
in
this
way
that
system
of
harmonious
cooperation
between
the
authorities
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
several
state
s
for
the
maintenance
of
their
common
institutions
which
existed
in
the
early
years
of
the
republic
was
destroyed
conflicts
of
jurisdiction
came
to
be
frequent
and
congress
found
itself
compelled
for
the
support
of
the
constitution
and
the
vindication
of
its
power
to
authorize
the
appointment
of
new
officers
charged
with
the
execution
of
its
acts
as
if
they
and
the
officers
of
the
states
were
the
ministers
respectively
of
foreign
governments
in
a
state
of
mutual
hostility
rather
than
fellowmagistrates
of
a
common
country
peacefully
subsisting
under
the
protection
of
one
wellconstituted
union
thus
here
also
aggression
was
followed
by
reaction
and
the
attacks
upon
the
constitution
at
this
point
did
but
serve
to
raise
up
new
barriers
for
its
defense
and
security
the
third
stage
of
this
unhappy
sectional
controversy
was
in
connection
with
the
organization
of
territorial
governments
and
the
admission
of
new
states
into
the
union
when
it
was
proposed
to
admit
the
state
of
maine
by
separation
of
territory
from
that
of
massachusetts
and
the
state
of
missouri
formed
of
a
portion
of
the
territory
ceded
by
france
to
the
united
states
representatives
in
congress
objected
to
the
admission
of
the
latter
unless
with
conditions
suited
to
particular
views
of
public
policy
the
imposition
of
such
a
condition
was
successfully
resisted
but
at
the
same
period
the
question
was
presented
of
imposing
restrictions
upon
the
residue
of
the
territory
ceded
by
france
that
question
was
for
the
time
disposed
of
by
the
adoption
of
a
geographical
line
of
limitation
in
this
connection
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
when
france
of
her
own
accord
resolved
for
considerations
of
the
most
farsighted
sagacity
to
cede
louisiana
to
the
united
states
and
that
accession
was
accepted
by
the
united
states
the
latter
expressly
engaged
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
ceded
territory
shall
be
incorporated
in
the
union
of
the
united
states
and
admitted
as
soon
as
possible
according
to
the
principles
of
the
federal
constitution
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
the
rights
advantages
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
meantime
they
shall
be
maintained
and
protected
in
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
liberty
property
and
the
religion
which
they
profess
that
is
to
say
while
it
remains
in
a
territorial
condition
its
inhabitants
are
maintained
and
protected
in
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
liberty
and
property
with
a
right
then
to
pass
into
the
condition
of
states
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
with
the
original
states
the
enactment
which
established
the
restrictive
geographical
line
was
acquiesced
in
rather
than
approved
by
the
states
of
the
union
it
stood
on
the
statute
book
however
for
a
number
of
years
and
the
people
of
the
respective
states
acquiesced
in
the
reenactment
of
the
principle
as
applied
to
the
state
of
texas
and
it
was
proposed
to
acquiesce
in
its
further
application
to
the
territory
acquired
by
the
united
states
from
mexico
but
this
proposition
was
successfully
resisted
by
the
representatives
from
the
northern
states
who
regardless
of
the
statute
line
insisted
upon
applying
restriction
to
the
new
territory
generally
whether
lying
north
or
south
of
it
thereby
repealing
it
as
a
legislative
compromise
and
on
the
part
of
the
north
persistently
violating
the
compact
if
compact
there
was
thereupon
this
enactment
ceased
to
have
binding
virtue
in
any
sense
whether
as
respects
the
north
or
the
south
and
so
in
effect
it
was
treated
on
the
occasion
of
the
admission
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
organization
of
the
territories
of
new
mexico
utah
and
washington
such
was
the
state
of
this
question
when
the
time
arrived
for
the
organization
of
the
territories
of
kansas
and
nebraska
in
the
progress
of
constitutional
inquiry
and
reflection
it
had
now
at
length
come
to
be
seen
clearly
that
congress
does
not
possess
constitutional
power
to
impose
restrictions
of
this
character
upon
any
present
or
future
state
of
the
union
in
a
long
series
of
decisions
on
the
fullest
argument
and
after
the
most
deliberate
consideration
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
finally
determined
this
point
in
every
form
under
which
the
question
could
arise
whether
as
affecting
public
or
private
rightsin
questions
of
the
public
domain
of
religion
of
navigation
and
of
servitude
the
several
states
of
the
union
are
by
force
of
the
constitution
coequal
in
domestic
legislative
power
congress
can
not
change
a
law
of
domestic
relation
in
the
state
of
maine
no
more
can
it
in
the
state
of
missouri
any
statute
which
proposes
to
do
this
is
a
mere
nullity
it
takes
away
no
right
it
confers
none
if
it
remains
on
the
statute
book
unrepealed
it
remains
there
only
as
a
monument
of
error
and
a
beacon
of
warning
to
the
legislator
and
the
statesman
to
repeal
it
will
be
only
to
remove
imperfection
from
the
statutes
without
affecting
either
in
the
sense
of
permission
or
of
prohibition
the
action
of
the
states
or
of
their
citizens
still
when
the
nominal
restriction
of
this
nature
already
a
dead
letter
in
law
was
in
terms
repealed
by
the
last
congress
in
a
clause
of
the
act
organizing
the
territories
of
kansas
and
nebraska
that
repeal
was
made
the
occasion
of
a
widespread
and
dangerous
agitation
it
was
alleged
that
the
original
enactment
being
a
compact
of
perpetual
moral
obligation
its
repeal
constituted
an
odious
breach
of
faith
an
act
of
congress
while
it
remains
unrepealed
more
especially
if
it
be
constitutionally
valid
in
the
judgment
of
those
public
functionaries
whose
duty
it
is
to
pronounce
on
that
point
is
undoubtedly
binding
on
the
conscience
of
each
good
citizen
of
the
republic
but
in
what
sense
can
it
be
asserted
that
the
enactment
in
question
was
invested
with
perpetuity
and
entitled
to
the
respect
of
a
solemn
compact
between
whom
was
the
compact
no
distinct
contending
powers
of
the
government
no
separate
sections
of
the
union
treating
as
such
entered
into
treaty
stipulations
on
the
subject
it
was
a
mere
clause
of
an
act
of
congress
and
like
any
other
controverted
matter
of
legislation
received
its
final
shape
and
was
passed
by
compromise
of
the
conflicting
opinions
or
sentiments
of
the
members
of
congress
but
if
it
had
moral
authority
over
mens
consciences
to
whom
did
this
authority
attach
not
to
those
of
the
north
who
had
repeatedly
refused
to
confirm
it
by
extension
and
who
had
zealously
striven
to
establish
other
and
incompatible
regulations
upon
the
subject
and
if
as
it
thus
appears
the
supposed
compact
had
no
obligatory
force
as
to
the
north
of
course
it
could
not
have
had
any
as
to
the
south
for
all
such
compacts
must
be
mutual
and
of
reciprocal
obligation
it
has
not
unfrequently
happened
that
lawgivers
with
undue
estimation
of
the
value
of
the
law
they
give
or
in
the
view
of
imparting
to
it
peculiar
strength
make
it
perpetual
in
terms
but
they
can
not
thus
bind
the
conscience
the
judgment
and
the
will
of
those
who
may
succeed
them
invested
with
similar
responsibilities
and
clothed
with
equal
authority
more
careful
investigation
may
prove
the
law
to
be
unsound
in
principle
experience
may
show
it
to
be
imperfect
in
detail
and
impracticable
in
execution
and
then
both
reason
and
right
combine
not
merely
to
justify
but
to
require
its
repeal
the
constitution
supreme
as
it
is
over
all
the
departments
of
the
governmentlegislative
executive
and
judicialis
open
to
amendment
by
its
very
terms
and
congress
or
the
states
may
in
their
discretion
propose
amendment
to
it
solemn
compact
though
it
in
truth
is
between
the
sovereign
states
of
the
union
in
the
present
instance
a
political
enactment
which
had
ceased
to
have
legal
power
or
authority
of
any
kind
was
repealed
the
position
assumed
that
congress
had
no
moral
right
to
enact
such
repeal
was
strange
enough
and
singularly
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
argument
came
from
those
who
openly
refused
obedience
to
existing
laws
of
the
land
having
the
same
popular
designation
and
quality
as
compromise
acts
nay
more
who
unequivocally
disregarded
and
condemned
the
most
positive
and
obligatory
injunctions
of
the
constitution
itself
and
sought
by
every
means
within
their
reach
to
deprive
a
portion
of
their
fellowcitizens
of
the
equal
enjoyment
of
those
rights
and
privileges
guaranteed
alike
to
all
by
the
fundamental
compact
of
our
union
this
argument
against
the
repeal
of
the
statute
line
in
question
was
accompanied
by
another
of
congenial
character
and
equally
with
the
former
destitute
of
foundation
in
reason
and
truth
it
was
imputed
that
the
measure
originated
in
the
conception
of
extending
the
limits
of
slave
labor
beyond
those
previously
assigned
to
it
and
that
such
was
its
natural
as
well
as
intended
effect
and
these
baseless
assumptions
were
made
in
the
northern
states
the
ground
of
unceasing
assault
upon
constitutional
right
the
repeal
in
terms
of
a
statute
which
was
already
obsolete
and
also
null
for
unconstitutionality
could
have
no
influence
to
obstruct
or
to
promote
the
propagation
of
conflicting
views
of
political
or
social
institution
when
the
act
organizing
the
territories
of
kansas
and
nebraska
was
passed
the
inherent
effect
upon
that
portion
of
the
public
domain
thus
opened
to
legal
settlement
was
to
admit
settlers
from
all
the
states
of
the
union
alike
each
with
his
convictions
of
public
policy
and
private
interest
there
to
found
in
their
discretion
subject
to
such
limitations
as
the
constitution
and
acts
of
congress
might
prescribe
new
states
hereafter
to
be
admitted
into
the
union
it
was
a
free
field
open
alike
to
all
whether
the
statute
line
of
assumed
restriction
were
repealed
or
not
that
repeal
did
not
open
to
free
competition
of
the
diverse
opinions
and
domestic
institutions
a
field
which
without
such
repeal
would
have
been
closed
against
them
it
found
that
field
of
competition
already
opened
in
fact
and
in
law
all
the
repeal
did
was
to
relieve
the
statute
book
of
an
objectionable
enactment
unconstitutional
in
effect
and
injurious
in
terms
to
a
large
portion
of
the
states
is
it
the
fact
that
in
all
the
unsettled
regions
of
th
e
united
states
if
emigration
be
left
free
to
act
in
this
respect
for
itself
without
legal
prohibitions
on
either
side
slave
labor
will
spontaneously
go
everywhere
in
preference
to
free
labor
is
it
the
fact
that
the
peculiar
domestic
institutions
of
the
southern
states
possess
relatively
so
much
of
vigor
that
wheresoever
an
avenue
is
freely
opened
to
all
the
world
they
will
penetrate
to
the
exclusion
of
those
of
the
northern
states
is
it
the
fact
that
the
former
enjoy
compared
with
the
latter
such
irresistibly
superior
vitality
independent
of
climate
soil
and
all
other
accidental
circumstances
as
to
be
able
to
produce
the
supposed
result
in
spite
of
the
assumed
moral
and
natural
obstacles
to
its
accomplishment
and
of
the
more
numerous
population
of
the
northern
states
the
argument
of
those
who
advocate
the
enactment
of
new
laws
of
restriction
and
condemn
the
repeal
of
old
ones
in
effect
avers
that
their
particular
views
of
government
have
no
selfextending
or
selfsustaining
power
of
their
own
and
will
go
nowhere
unless
forced
by
act
of
congress
and
if
congress
do
but
pause
for
a
moment
in
the
policy
of
stern
coercion
if
it
venture
to
try
the
experiment
of
leaving
men
to
judge
for
themselves
what
institutions
will
best
suit
them
if
it
be
not
strained
up
to
perpetual
legislative
exertion
on
this
pointif
congress
proceed
thus
to
act
in
the
very
spirit
of
liberty
it
is
at
once
charged
with
aiming
to
extend
slave
labor
into
all
the
new
territories
of
the
united
states
of
course
these
imputations
on
the
intentions
of
congress
in
this
respect
conceived
as
they
were
in
prejudice
and
disseminated
in
passion
are
utterly
destitute
of
any
justification
in
the
nature
of
things
and
contrary
to
all
the
fundamental
doctrines
and
principles
of
civil
liberty
and
selfgovernment
while
therefore
in
general
the
people
of
the
northern
states
have
never
at
any
time
arrogated
for
the
federal
government
the
power
to
interfere
directly
with
the
domestic
condition
of
persons
in
the
southern
states
but
on
the
contrary
have
disavowed
all
such
intentions
and
have
shrunk
from
conspicuous
affiliation
with
those
few
who
pursue
their
fanatical
objects
avowedly
through
the
contemplated
means
of
revolutionary
change
of
the
government
and
with
acceptance
of
the
necessary
consequencesa
civil
and
servile
waryet
many
citizens
have
suffered
themselves
to
be
drawn
into
one
evanescent
political
issue
of
agitation
after
another
appertaining
to
the
same
set
of
opinions
and
which
subsided
as
rapidly
as
they
arose
when
it
came
to
be
seen
as
it
uniformly
did
that
they
were
incompatible
with
the
compacts
of
the
constitution
and
the
existence
of
the
union
thus
when
the
acts
of
some
of
the
states
to
nullify
the
existing
extradition
law
imposed
upon
congress
the
duty
of
passing
a
new
one
the
country
was
invited
by
agitators
to
enter
into
party
organization
for
its
repeal
but
that
agitation
speedily
ceased
by
reason
of
the
impracticability
of
its
object
so
when
the
statute
restriction
upon
the
institutions
of
new
states
by
a
geographical
line
had
been
repealed
the
country
was
urged
to
demand
its
restoration
and
that
project
also
died
almost
with
its
birth
then
followed
the
cry
of
alarm
from
the
north
against
imputed
southern
encroachments
which
cry
sprang
in
reality
from
the
spirit
of
revolutionary
attack
on
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
south
and
after
a
troubled
existence
of
a
few
months
has
been
rebuked
by
the
voice
of
a
patriotic
people
of
this
last
agitation
one
lamentable
feature
was
that
it
was
carried
on
at
the
immediate
expense
of
the
peace
and
happiness
of
the
people
of
the
territory
of
kansas
that
was
made
the
battlefield
not
so
much
of
opposing
factions
or
interests
within
itself
as
of
the
conflicting
passions
of
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
revolutionary
disorder
in
kansas
had
its
origin
in
projects
of
intervention
deliberately
arranged
by
certain
members
of
that
congress
which
enacted
the
law
for
the
organization
of
the
territory
and
when
propagandist
colonization
of
kansas
had
thus
been
undertaken
in
one
section
of
the
union
for
the
systematic
promotion
of
its
peculiar
views
of
policy
there
ensued
as
a
matter
of
course
a
counteraction
with
opposite
views
in
other
sections
of
the
union
in
consequence
of
these
and
other
incidents
many
acts
of
disorder
it
is
undeniable
have
been
perpetrated
in
kansas
to
the
occasional
interruption
rather
than
the
permanent
suspension
of
regular
government
aggressive
and
most
reprehensible
incursions
into
the
territory
were
undertaken
both
in
the
north
and
the
south
and
entered
it
on
its
northern
border
by
the
way
of
iowa
as
well
as
on
the
eastern
by
way
of
missouri
and
there
has
existed
within
it
a
state
of
insurrection
against
the
constituted
authorities
not
without
countenance
from
inconsiderate
persons
in
each
of
the
great
sections
of
the
union
but
the
difficulties
in
that
territory
have
been
extravagantly
exaggerated
for
purposes
of
political
agitation
elsewhere
the
number
and
gravity
of
the
acts
of
violence
have
been
magnified
partly
by
statements
entirely
untrue
and
partly
by
reiterated
accounts
of
the
same
rumors
or
facts
thus
the
territory
has
been
seemingly
filled
with
extreme
violence
when
the
whole
amount
of
such
acts
has
not
been
greater
than
what
occasionally
passes
before
us
in
single
cities
to
the
regret
of
all
good
citizens
but
without
being
regarded
as
of
general
or
permanent
political
consequence
imputed
irregularities
in
the
elections
had
in
kansas
like
occasional
irregularities
of
the
same
description
in
the
states
were
beyond
the
sphere
of
action
of
the
executive
but
incidents
of
actual
violence
or
of
organized
obstruction
of
law
pertinaciously
renewed
from
time
to
time
have
been
met
as
they
occurred
by
such
means
as
were
available
and
as
the
circumstances
required
and
nothing
of
this
character
now
remains
to
affect
the
general
peace
of
the
union
the
attempt
of
a
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
territory
to
erect
a
revolutionary
government
though
sedulously
encouraged
and
supplied
with
pecuniary
aid
from
active
agents
of
disorder
in
some
of
the
states
has
completely
failed
bodies
of
armed
men
foreign
to
the
territory
have
been
prevented
from
entering
or
compelled
to
leave
it
predatory
bands
engaged
in
acts
of
rapine
under
cover
of
the
existing
political
disturbances
have
been
arrested
or
dispersed
and
every
welldisposed
person
is
now
enabled
once
more
to
devote
himself
in
peace
to
the
pursuits
of
prosperous
industry
for
the
prosecution
of
which
he
undertook
to
participate
in
the
settlement
of
the
territory
it
affords
me
unmingled
satisfaction
thus
to
announce
the
peaceful
condition
of
things
in
kansas
especially
considering
the
means
to
which
it
was
necessary
to
have
recourse
for
the
attainment
of
the
end
namely
the
employment
of
a
part
of
the
military
force
of
the
united
states
the
withdrawal
of
that
force
from
its
proper
duty
of
defending
the
country
against
foreign
foes
or
the
savages
of
the
frontier
to
employ
it
for
the
suppression
of
domestic
insurrection
is
when
the
exigency
occurs
a
matter
of
the
most
earnest
solicitude
on
this
occasion
of
imperative
necessity
it
has
been
done
with
the
best
results
and
my
satisfaction
in
the
attainment
of
such
results
by
such
means
is
greatly
enhanced
by
the
consideration
that
through
the
wisdom
and
energy
of
the
present
executive
of
kansas
and
the
prudence
firmness
and
vigilance
of
the
military
officers
on
duty
there
tranquillity
has
been
restored
without
one
drop
of
blood
having
been
shed
in
its
accomplishment
by
the
forces
of
the
united
states
the
restoration
of
comparative
tranquillity
in
that
territory
furnishes
the
means
of
observing
calmly
and
appreciating
at
their
just
value
the
events
which
have
occurred
there
and
the
discussions
of
which
the
government
of
the
territory
has
been
the
subject
we
perceive
that
controversy
concerning
its
future
domestic
institutions
was
inevitable
that
no
human
prudence
no
form
of
legislation
no
wisdom
on
the
part
of
congress
could
have
prevented
it
it
is
idle
to
suppose
that
the
particular
provisions
of
their
organic
law
were
the
cause
of
agitation
those
provisions
were
but
the
occasion
or
the
pretext
of
an
agitation
which
was
inherent
in
the
nature
of
things
congress
legislated
upon
the
subject
in
such
terms
as
were
most
consonant
with
the
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
which
underlies
our
government
it
could
not
have
legislated
otherwise
without
doing
violence
to
another
great
principle
of
our
institutionsthe
imprescriptible
right
of
equality
of
the
several
states
we
perceive
also
that
sectional
interests
and
party
passions
have
been
the
great
impediment
to
the
salutary
operation
of
the
organic
principles
adopted
and
the
chief
cause
of
the
successive
disturbances
in
kansas
the
assumption
that
because
in
the
organization
of
the
territories
of
nebraska
and
kansas
congress
abstained
from
imposing
restraints
upon
them
to
which
certain
other
territories
had
been
subject
therefore
disorders
occurred
in
the
latter
territory
is
emphatically
contradicted
by
the
fact
that
none
have
occurred
in
the
former
those
disorders
were
not
the
consequence
in
kansas
of
the
freedom
of
selfgovernment
conceded
to
that
territory
by
congress
but
of
unjust
interference
on
the
part
of
persons
not
inhabitants
of
the
territory
such
interference
wherever
it
has
exhibited
itself
by
acts
of
insurrectionary
character
or
of
obstruction
to
process
of
law
has
been
repelled
or
suppressed
by
all
the
means
which
the
constitution
and
the
laws
place
in
the
hands
of
the
executive
in
those
parts
of
the
united
states
where
by
reason
of
the
inflamed
state
of
the
public
mind
false
rumors
and
misrepresentations
have
the
greatest
currency
it
has
been
assumed
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
executive
not
only
to
suppress
insurrectionary
movements
in
kansas
but
also
to
see
to
the
regularity
of
local
elections
it
needs
little
argument
to
show
that
the
president
has
no
such
power
all
government
in
the
united
states
rests
substantially
upon
popular
election
th
e
freedom
of
elections
is
liable
to
be
impaired
by
the
intrusion
of
unlawful
votes
or
the
exclusion
of
lawful
ones
by
improper
influences
by
violence
or
by
fraud
but
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
themselves
the
all
sufficient
guardians
of
their
own
rights
and
to
suppose
that
they
will
not
remedy
in
due
season
any
such
incidents
of
civil
freedom
is
to
suppose
them
to
have
ceased
to
be
capable
of
selfgovernment
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
not
power
to
interpose
in
elections
to
see
to
their
freedom
to
canvass
their
votes
or
to
pass
upon
their
legality
in
the
territories
any
more
than
in
the
states
if
he
had
such
power
the
government
might
be
republican
in
form
but
it
would
be
a
monarchy
in
fact
and
if
he
had
undertaken
to
exercise
it
in
the
case
of
kansas
he
would
have
been
justly
subject
to
the
charge
of
usurpation
and
of
violation
of
the
dearest
rights
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
unwise
laws
equally
with
irregularities
at
elections
are
in
periods
of
great
excitement
the
occasional
incidents
of
even
the
freest
and
best
political
institutions
but
all
experience
demonstrates
that
in
a
country
like
ours
where
the
right
of
selfconstitution
exists
in
the
completest
form
the
attempt
to
remedy
unwise
legislation
by
resort
to
revolution
is
totally
out
of
place
inasmuch
as
existing
legal
institutions
afford
more
prompt
and
efficacious
means
for
the
redress
of
wrong
i
confidently
trust
that
now
when
the
peaceful
condition
of
kansas
affords
opportunity
for
calm
reflection
and
wise
legislation
either
the
legislative
assembly
of
the
territory
or
congress
will
see
that
no
act
shall
remain
on
its
statute
book
violative
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
or
subversive
of
the
great
objects
for
which
that
was
ordained
and
established
and
will
take
all
other
necessary
steps
to
assure
to
its
inhabitants
the
enjoyment
without
obstruction
or
abridgment
of
all
the
constitutional
rights
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
contemplated
by
the
organic
law
of
the
territory
full
information
in
relation
to
recent
events
in
this
territory
will
be
found
in
the
documents
communicated
herewith
from
the
departments
of
state
and
war
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
particular
information
concerning
the
financial
condition
of
the
government
and
the
various
branches
of
the
public
service
connected
with
the
treasury
department
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
receipts
from
customs
were
for
the
first
time
more
than
and
from
all
sources
which
with
the
balance
on
hand
up
to
the
st
of
july
made
the
total
resources
of
the
year
amount
to
the
expenditures
including
in
execution
of
the
treaty
with
mexico
and
excluding
sums
paid
on
account
of
the
public
debt
amounted
to
and
including
the
latter
to
the
payment
on
this
account
having
amounted
to
on
the
th
of
march
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
was
there
was
a
subsequent
increase
of
for
the
debt
of
texas
making
a
total
of
of
this
the
sum
of
including
premium
has
been
discharged
reducing
the
debt
to
all
which
might
be
paid
within
a
year
without
embarrassing
the
public
service
but
being
not
yet
due
and
only
redeemable
at
the
option
of
the
holder
can
not
be
pressed
to
payment
by
the
government
on
examining
the
expenditures
of
the
last
five
years
it
will
be
seen
that
the
average
deducting
payments
on
account
of
the
public
debt
and
paid
by
treaty
to
mexico
has
been
but
about
it
is
believed
that
under
an
economical
administration
of
the
government
the
average
expenditure
for
the
ensuing
five
years
will
not
exceed
that
sum
unless
extraordinary
occasion
for
its
increase
should
occur
the
acts
granting
bounty
lands
will
soon
have
been
executed
while
the
extension
of
our
frontier
settlements
will
cause
a
continued
demand
for
lands
and
augmented
receipts
probably
from
that
source
these
considerations
will
justify
a
reduction
of
the
revenue
from
customs
so
as
not
to
exceed
fortyeight
or
fifty
million
dollars
i
think
the
exigency
for
such
reduction
is
imperative
and
again
urge
it
upon
the
consideration
of
congress
the
amount
of
reduction
as
well
as
the
manner
of
effecting
it
are
questions
of
great
and
general
interest
it
being
essential
to
industrial
enterprise
and
the
public
prosperity
as
well
as
the
dictate
of
obvious
justice
that
the
burden
of
taxation
be
made
to
rest
as
equally
as
possible
upon
all
classes
and
all
sections
and
interests
of
the
country
i
have
heretofore
recommended
to
your
consideration
the
revision
of
the
revenue
laws
prepared
under
the
direction
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
also
legislation
upon
some
special
questions
affecting
the
business
of
that
department
more
especially
the
enactment
of
a
law
to
punish
the
abstraction
of
official
books
or
papers
from
the
files
of
the
government
and
requiring
all
such
books
and
papers
and
all
other
public
property
to
be
turned
over
by
the
outgoing
officer
to
his
successor
of
a
law
requiring
disbursing
officers
to
deposit
all
public
money
in
the
vaults
of
the
treasury
or
in
other
legal
depositories
where
the
same
are
conveniently
accessible
and
a
law
to
extend
existing
penal
provisions
to
all
persons
who
may
become
possessed
of
public
money
by
deposit
or
otherwise
and
who
shall
refuse
or
neglect
on
due
demand
to
pay
the
same
into
the
treasury
i
invite
your
attention
anew
to
each
of
these
objects
the
army
during
the
past
year
has
been
so
constantly
employed
against
hostile
indians
in
various
quarters
that
it
can
scarcely
be
said
with
propriety
of
language
to
have
been
a
peace
establishment
its
duties
have
been
satisfactorily
performed
and
we
have
reason
to
expect
as
a
result
of
the
years
operations
greater
security
to
the
frontier
inhabitants
than
has
been
hitherto
enjoyed
extensive
combinations
among
the
hostile
indians
of
the
territories
of
washington
and
oregon
at
one
time
threatened
the
devastation
of
the
newly
formed
settlements
of
that
remote
portion
of
the
country
from
recent
information
we
are
permitted
to
hope
that
the
energetic
and
successful
operations
conducted
there
will
prevent
such
combinations
in
future
and
secure
to
those
territories
an
opportunity
to
make
steady
progress
in
the
development
of
their
agricultural
and
mineral
resources
legislation
has
been
recommended
by
me
on
previous
occasions
to
cure
defects
in
the
existing
organization
and
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
army
and
further
observation
has
but
served
to
confirm
me
in
the
views
then
expressed
and
to
enforce
on
my
mind
the
conviction
that
such
measures
are
not
only
proper
but
necessary
i
have
in
addition
to
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
a
change
of
policy
in
the
distribution
of
troops
and
to
the
necessity
of
providing
a
more
rapid
increase
of
the
military
armament
for
details
of
these
and
other
subjects
relating
to
the
army
i
refer
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
the
condition
of
the
navy
is
not
merely
satisfactory
but
exhibits
the
most
gratifying
evidences
of
increased
vigor
as
it
is
comparatively
small
it
is
more
important
that
it
should
be
as
complete
as
possible
in
all
the
elements
of
strength
that
it
should
be
efficient
in
the
character
of
its
officers
in
the
zeal
and
discipline
of
its
men
in
the
reliability
of
its
ordnance
and
in
the
capacity
of
its
ships
in
all
these
various
qualities
the
navy
has
made
great
progress
within
the
last
few
years
the
execution
of
the
law
of
congress
of
february
to
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
navy
has
been
attended
by
the
most
advantageous
results
the
law
for
promoting
discipline
among
the
men
is
found
convenient
and
salutary
the
system
of
granting
an
honorable
discharge
to
faithful
seamen
on
the
expiration
of
the
period
of
their
enlistment
and
permitting
them
to
reenlist
after
a
leave
of
absence
of
a
few
months
without
cessation
of
pay
is
highly
beneficial
in
its
influence
the
apprentice
system
recently
adopted
is
evidently
destined
to
incorporate
into
the
service
a
large
number
of
our
countrymen
hitherto
so
difficult
to
procure
several
hundred
american
boys
are
now
on
a
three
years
cruise
in
our
national
vessels
and
will
return
welltrained
seamen
in
the
ordnance
department
there
is
a
decided
and
gratifying
indication
of
progress
creditable
to
it
and
to
the
country
the
suggestions
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
regard
to
further
improvement
in
that
branch
of
the
service
i
commend
to
your
favorable
action
the
new
frigates
ordered
by
congress
are
now
afloat
and
two
of
them
in
active
service
they
are
superior
models
of
naval
architecture
and
with
their
formidable
battery
add
largely
to
public
strength
and
security
i
concur
in
the
views
expressed
by
the
secretary
of
the
department
in
favor
of
a
still
further
increase
of
our
naval
force
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
presents
facts
and
views
in
relation
to
internal
affairs
over
which
the
supervision
of
his
department
extends
of
much
interest
and
importance
the
aggregate
sales
of
the
public
lands
during
the
last
fiscal
year
amount
to
acres
for
which
has
been
received
the
sum
of
during
the
same
period
there
have
been
located
with
military
scrip
and
land
warrants
and
for
other
purposes
acres
thus
making
a
total
aggregate
of
acres
on
the
th
of
september
last
surveys
had
been
made
of
acres
a
large
proportion
of
which
is
ready
for
market
the
suggestions
in
this
report
in
regard
to
the
complication
and
progressive
expansion
of
the
business
of
the
different
bureaus
of
the
department
to
the
pension
system
to
the
colonization
of
indian
tribes
and
the
recommendations
in
relation
to
various
improvements
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
especially
commended
to
your
consideration
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
presents
fully
the
condition
of
that
department
of
the
government
its
expenditures
for
the
last
fiscal
year
were
and
its
gross
receipts
making
an
excess
of
expenditure
over
receipts
of
the
deficiency
of
this
department
is
thus
greater
than
for
the
year
ending
june
of
this
deficiency
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
additional
compensation
allowed
to
postmasters
by
the
act
of
congress
of
june
the

mail
facilities
in
every
part
of
the
country
have
been
very
much
increased
in
that
period
and
the
large
addition
of
railroad
service
amounting
to
miles
has
added
largely
to
the
cost
of
transportation
the
inconsiderable
augmentation
of
the
income
of
the
postoffice
department
under
the
reduced
rates
of
postage
and
its
increasing
expenditures
must
for
the
present
make
it
dependent
to
some
extent
upon
the
treasury
for
support
the
recommendations
of
the
postmastergeneral
in
relation
to
the
abolition
of
the
franking
privilege
and
his
views
on
the
establishment
of
mail
steamship
lines
deserve
the
consideration
of
congress
i
also
call
the
special
attention
of
congress
to
the
statement
of
the
postmastergeneral
respecting
the
sums
now
paid
for
the
transportation
of
mails
to
the
panama
railroad
company
and
commend
to
their
early
and
favorable
consideration
the
suggestions
of
that
officer
in
relation
to
new
contracts
for
mail
transportation
upon
that
route
and
also
upon
the
tehuantepec
and
nicaragua
routes
the
united
states
continue
in
the
enjoyment
of
amicable
relations
with
all
foreign
powers
when
my
last
annual
message
was
transmitted
to
congress
two
subjects
of
controversy
one
relating
to
the
enlistment
of
soldiers
in
this
country
for
foreign
service
and
the
other
to
central
america
threatened
to
disturb
the
good
understanding
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
of
the
progress
and
termination
of
the
former
question
you
were
informed
at
the
time
and
the
other
is
now
in
the
way
of
satisfactory
adjustment
the
object
of
the
convention
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
of
the
th
of
april
was
to
secure
for
the
benefit
of
all
nations
the
neutrality
and
the
common
use
of
any
transit
way
or
interoceanic
communication
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
which
might
be
opened
within
the
limits
of
central
america
the
pretensions
subsequently
asserted
by
great
britain
to
dominion
or
control
over
territories
in
or
near
two
of
the
routes
those
of
nicaragua
and
honduras
were
deemed
by
the
united
states
not
merely
incompatible
with
the
main
object
of
the
treaty
but
opposed
even
to
its
express
stipulations
occasion
of
controversy
on
this
point
has
been
removed
by
an
additional
treaty
which
our
minister
at
london
has
concluded
and
which
will
be
immediately
submitted
to
the
senate
for
its
consideration
should
the
proposed
supplemental
arrangement
be
concurred
in
by
all
the
parties
to
be
affected
by
it
the
objects
contemplated
by
the
original
convention
will
have
been
fully
attained
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
of
the
th
of
june
which
went
into
effective
operation
in
put
an
end
to
causes
of
irritation
between
the
two
countries
by
securing
to
the
united
states
the
right
of
fishery
on
the
coast
of
the
british
north
american
provinces
with
advantages
equal
to
those
enjoyed
by
british
subjects
besides
the
signal
benefits
of
this
treaty
to
a
large
class
of
our
citizens
engaged
in
a
pursuit
connected
to
no
inconsiderable
degree
with
our
national
prosperity
and
strength
it
has
had
a
favorable
effect
upon
other
interests
in
the
provision
it
made
for
reciprocal
freedom
of
trade
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
provinces
in
america
the
exports
of
domestic
articles
to
those
provinces
during
the
last
year
amounted
to
more
than
exceeding
those
of
the
preceding
year
by
nearly
and
the
imports
therefrom
during
the
same
period
amounted
to
more
than
twentyone
million
an
increase
of
six
million
upon
those
of
the
previous
year
the
improved
condition
of
this
branch
of
our
commerce
is
mainly
attributable
to
the
abovementioned
treaty
provision
was
made
in
the
first
article
of
that
treaty
for
a
commission
to
designate
the
mouths
of
rivers
to
which
the
common
right
of
fishery
on
the
coast
of
the
united
states
and
the
british
provinces
was
not
to
extend
this
commission
has
been
employed
a
part
of
two
seasons
but
without
much
progress
in
accomplishing
the
object
for
which
it
was
instituted
in
consequence
of
a
serious
difference
of
opinion
between
the
commissioners
not
only
as
to
the
precise
point
where
the
rivers
terminate
but
in
many
instances
as
to
what
constitutes
a
river
these
difficulties
however
may
be
overcome
by
resort
to
the
umpirage
provided
for
by
the
treaty
the
efforts
perseveringly
prosecuted
since
the
commencement
of
my
administration
to
relieve
our
trade
to
the
baltic
from
the
exaction
of
sound
dues
by
denmark
have
not
yet
been
attended
with
success
other
governments
have
also
sought
to
obtain
a
like
relief
to
their
commerce
and
denmark
was
thus
induced
to
propose
an
arrangement
to
all
the
european
powers
interested
in
the
subject
and
the
manner
in
which
her
proposition
was
received
warranting
her
to
believe
that
a
satisfactory
arrangement
with
them
could
soon
be
concluded
she
made
a
strong
appeal
to
this
government
for
temporary
suspension
of
definite
action
on
its
part
in
consideration
of
the
embarrassment
which
might
result
to
her
european
negotiations
by
an
immediate
adjustment
of
the
question
with
the
united
states
this
request
has
been
acceded
to
upon
the
condition
that
the
sums
collected
after
the
th
of
june
last
and
until
the
th
of
june
next
from
vessels
and
cargoes
belonging
to
our
merchants
are
to
be
considered
as
paid
under
protest
and
subject
to
future
adjustment
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
an
arrangement
between
denmark
and
the
maritime
powers
of
europe
on
the
subject
will
be
soon
concluded
and
that
the
pending
negotiation
with
the
united
states
may
then
be
resumed
and
terminated
in
a
satisfactory
manner
with
spain
no
new
difficulties
have
arisen
nor
has
much
progress
been
made
in
the
adjustment
of
pending
ones
negotiations
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
our
commercial
intercourse
with
the
island
of
cuba
of
some
of
its
burdens
and
providing
for
the
more
speedy
settlement
of
local
disputes
growing
out
of
that
intercourse
have
not
yet
been
attended
with
any
results
soon
after
the
commencement
of
the
late
war
in
europe
this
government
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
all
maritime
nations
two
principles
for
the
security
of
neutral
commerceone
that
the
neutral
flag
should
cover
enemies
goods
except
articles
contraband
of
war
and
the
other
that
neutral
property
on
board
merchant
vessels
of
belligerents
should
be
exempt
from
condemnation
with
the
exception
of
contraband
articles
these
were
not
presented
as
new
rules
of
international
law
having
been
generally
claimed
by
neutrals
though
not
always
admitted
by
belligerents
one
of
the
parties
to
the
war
russia
as
well
as
several
neutral
powers
promptly
acceded
to
these
propositions
and
the
two
other
principal
belligerents
great
britain
and
france
having
consented
to
observe
them
for
the
present
occasion
a
favorable
opportunity
seemed
to
be
presented
for
obtaining
a
general
recognition
of
them
both
in
europe
and
america
but
great
britain
and
france
in
common
with
most
of
the
states
of
europe
while
forbearing
to
reject
did
not
affirmatively
act
upon
the
overtures
of
the
united
states
while
the
question
was
in
this
position

representatives
of
russia

prussia
sardinia
and
turkey
assembled
at
paris
took
into
consideration
the
subject
of
maritime
rights
and
put
forth
a
declaration
containing
the
two
principles
which
this
government
had
submitted
nearly
two
years
before
to
the
consideration
of
maritime
powers
and
adding
thereto
the
following
propositions
privateering
is
and
remains
abolished
and
blockades
in
order
to
be
binding
must
be
effective
that
is
to
say
maintained
by
a
force
sufficient
really
to
prevent
access
to
the
coast
of
the
enemy
and
to
the
declaration
thus
composed
of
four
points
two
of
which
had
already
been
proposed
by
the
united
states
this
government
has
been
invited
to
accede
by
all
the
powers
represented
at
paris
except
great
britain
and
turkey
to
the
last
of
the
two
additional
propositionsthat
in
relation
to
blockadesthere
can
certainly
be
no
objection
it
is
merely
the
definition
of
what
shall
constitute
the
effectual
investment
of
a
blockaded
place
a
definition
for
which
this
government
has
always
contended
claiming
indemnity
for
losses
where
a
practical
violation
of
the
rule
thus
defined
has
been
injurious
to
our
commerce
as
to
the
remaining
article
of
the
declaration
of
the
conference
of
paris
that
privateering
is
and
remains
abolished
i
certainly
can
not
ascribe
to
the
powers
represented
in
the
conference
of
paris
any
but
liberal
and
philanthropic
views
in
the
attempt
to
change
the
unquestionable
rule
of
maritime
law
in
regard
to
privateering
their
proposition
was
doubtless
intended
to
imply
approval
of
the
principle
that
private
property
upon
the
ocean
although
it
might
belong
to
the
citizens
of
a
belligerent
state
should
be
exempted
from
capture
and
had
that
proposition
been
so
framed
as
to
give
full
effect
to
the
principle
it
would
have
received
my
ready
assent
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
but
the
measure
proposed
is
inadequate
to
that
purpose
it
is
true
that
if
adopted
private
property
upon
the
ocean
would
be
withdrawn
from
one
mode
of
plunder
but
left
exposed
meanwhile
to
another
mode
which
could
be
used
with
increased
effectiveness
the
aggressive
capacity
of
great
naval
powers
would
be
thereby
augmented
while
the
defensive
ability
of
others
would
be
reduced
though
the
surrender
of
the
means
of
prosecuting
hostilities
by
employing
privateers
as
proposed
by
the
conference
of
paris
is
mutual
in
terms
yet
in
practical
effect
it
would
be
the
relinquishment
of
a
right
of
little
value
to
one
class
of
states
but
of
essential
importance
to
another
and
a
far
larger
class
it
ought
not
to
have
been
anticipated
that
a
measure
so
inadequate
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
proposed
object
and
so
unequal
in
its
operation
would
receive
the
assent
of
all
maritime
powers
private
property
would
be
still
left
to
the
depredations
of
the
public
armed
cruisers
i
have
expressed
a
readiness
on
the
part
of
this
government
to
accede
to
all
the
principles
contained
in
the
declaration
of
the
conference
of
pari
s
provided
that
the
one
relating
to
the
abandonment
of
privateering
can
be
so
amended
as
to
effect
the
object
for
which
as
is
presumed
it
was
intendedthe
immunity
of
private
property
on
the
ocean
from
hostile
capture
to
effect
this
object
it
is
proposed
to
add
to
the
declaration
that
privateering
is
and
remains
abolished
the
following
amendment
and
that
the
private
property
of
subjects
and
citizens
of
a
belligerent
on
the
high
seas
shall
be
exempt
from
seizure
by
the
public
armed
vessels
of
the
other
belligerent
except
it
be
contraband
this
amendment
has
been
presented
not
only
to
the
powers
which
have
asked
our
assent
to
the
declaration
to
abolish
privateering
but
to
all
other
maritime
states
thus
far
it
has
not
been
rejected
by
any
and
is
favorably
entertained
by
all
which
have
made
any
communication
in
reply
several
of
the
governments
regarding
with
favor
the
proposition
of
the
united
states
have
delayed
definitive
action
upon
it
only
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
with
others
parties
to
the
conference
of
paris
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
stating
however
that
the
emperor
of
russia
has
entirely
and
explicitly
approved
of
that
modification
and
will
cooperate
in
endeavoring
to
obtain
the
assent
of
other
powers
and
that
assurances
of
a
similar
purport
have
been
received
in
relation
to
the
disposition
of
the
emperor
of
the
french
the
present
aspect
of
this
important
subject
allows
us
to
cherish
the
hope
that
a
principle
so
humane
in
its
character
so
just
and
equal
in
its
operation
so
essential
to
the
prosperity
of
commercial
nations
and
so
consonant
to
the
sentiments
of
this
enlightened
period
of
the
world
will
command
the
approbation
of
all
maritime
powers
and
thus
be
incorporated
into
the
code
of
international
law
my
views
on
the
subject
are
more
fully
set
forth
in
the
reply
of
the
secretary
of
state
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
transmitted
to
the
communications
on
the
subject
made
to
this
government
especially
to
the
communication
of
france
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
at
all
times
regarded
with
friendly
interest
the
other
states
of
america
formerly
like
this
country
european
colonies
and
now
independent
members
of
the
great
family
of
nations
but
the
unsettled
condition
of
some
of
them
distracted
by
frequent
revolutions
and
thus
incapable
of
regular
and
firm
internal
administration
has
tended
to
embarrass
occasionally
our
public
intercourse
by
reason
of
wrongs
which
our
citizens
suffer
at
their
hands
and
which
they
are
slow
to
redress
unfortunately
it
is
against
the
republic
of
mexico
with
which
it
is
our
special
desire
to
maintain
a
good
understanding
that
such
complaints
are
most
numerous
and
although
earnestly
urged
upon
its
attention
they
have
not
as
yet
received
the
consideration
which
this
government
had
a
right
to
expect
while
reparation
for
past
injuries
has
been
withheld
others
have
been
added
the
political
condition
of
that
country
however
has
been
such
as
to
demand
forbearance
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
i
shall
continue
my
efforts
to
procure
for
the
wrongs
of
our
citizens
that
redress
which
is
indispensable
to
the
continued
friendly
association
of
the
two
republics
the
peculiar
condition
of
affairs
in
nicaragua
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
year
rendered
it
important
that
this
government
should
have
diplomatic
relations
with
that
state
through
its
territory
had
been
opened
one
of
the
principal
thoroughfares
across
the
isthmus
connecting
north
and
south
america
on
which
a
vast
amount
of
property
was
transported
and
to
which
our
citizens
resorted
in
great
numbers
in
passing
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
of
the
united
states
the
protection
of
both
required
that
the
existing
power
in
that
state
should
be
regarded
as
a
responsible
government
and
its
minister
was
accordingly
received
but
he
remained
here
only
a
short
time
soon
thereafter
the
political
affairs
of
nicaragua
underwent
unfavorable
change
and
became
involved
in
much
uncertainty
and
confusion
diplomatic
representatives
from
two
contending
parties
have
been
recently
sent
to
this
government
but
with
the
imperfect
information
possessed
it
was
not
possible
to
decide
which
was
the
government
de
facto
and
awaiting
further
developments
i
have
refused
to
receive
either
questions
of
the
most
serious
nature
are
pending
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
new
granada
the
government
of
that
republic
undertook
a
year
since
to
impose
tonnage
duties
on
foreign
vessels
in
her
ports
but
the
purpose
was
resisted
by
this
government
as
being
contrary
to
existing
treaty
stipulations
with
the
united
states
and
to
rights
conferred
by
charter
upon
the
panama
railroad
company
and
was
accordingly
refurbished
at
that
time
it
being
admitted
that
our
vessels
were
entitled
to
be
exempt
from
tonnage
duty
in
the
free
ports
of
panama
and
aspinwall
but
the
purpose
has
been
recently
revived
on
the
part
of
new
granada
by
the
enactment
of
a
law
to
subject
vessels
visiting
her
ports
to
the
tonnage
duty
of
cents
per
ton
and
although
the
law
has
not
been
put
in
force
yet
the
right
to
enforce
it
is
still
asserted
and
may
at
any
time
be
acted
on
by
the
government
of
that
republic
the
congress
of
new
granada
has
also
enacted
a
law
during
the
last
year
which
levies
a
tax
of
more
than
on
every
pound
of
mail
matter
transported
across
the
isthmus
the
sum
thus
required
to
be
paid
on
the
mails
of
the
united
states
would
be
nearly
annually
in
addition
to
the
large
sum
payable
by
contract
to
the
panama
railroad
company
if
the
only
objection
to
this
exaction
were
the
exorbitancy
of
its
amount
it
could
not
be
submitted
to
by
the
united
states
the
imposition
of
it
however
would
obviously
contravene
our
treaty
with
new
granada
and
infringe
the
contract
of
that
republic
with
the
panama
railroad
company
the
law
providing
for
this
tax
was
by
its
terms
to
take
effect
on
the
st
of
september
last
but
the
local
authorities
on
the
isthmus
have
been
induced
to
suspend
its
execution
and
to
await
further
instructions
on
the
subject
from
the
government
of
the
republic
i
am
not
yet
advised
of
the
determination
of
that
government
if
a
measure
so
extraordinary
in
its
character
and
so
clearly
contrary
to
treaty
stipulations
and
the
contract
rights
of
the
panama
railroad
company
composed
mostly
of
american
citizens
should
be
persisted
in
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
resist
its
execution
i
regret
exceedingly
that
occasion
exists
to
invite
your
attention
to
a
subject
of
still
graver
import
in
our
relations
with
the
republic
of
new
granada
on
the
th
day
of
april
last
a
riotous
assemblage
of
the
inhabitants
of
panama
committed
a
violent
and
outrageous
attack
on
the
premises
of
the
railroad
company
and
the
passengers
and
other
persons
in
or
near
the
same
involving
the
death
of
several
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
pillage
of
many
others
and
the
destruction
of
a
large
amount
of
property
belonging
to
the
railroad
company
i
caused
full
investigation
of
that
event
to
be
made
and
the
result
shows
satisfactorily
that
complete
responsibility
for
what
occurred
attaches
to
the
government
of
new
granada
i
have
therefore
demanded
of
that
government
that
the
perpetrators
of
the
wrongs
in
question
should
be
punished
that
provision
should
be
made
for
the
families
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
were
killed
with
full
indemnity
for
the
property
pillaged
or
destroyed
the
present
condition
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
in
so
far
as
regards
the
security
of
persons
and
property
passing
over
it
requires
serious
consideration
recent
incidents
tend
to
show
that
the
local
authorities
can
not
be
relied
on
to
maintain
the
public
peace
of
panama
and
there
is
just
ground
for
apprehension
that
a
portion
of
the
inhabitants
are
meditating
further
outrages
without
adequate
measures
for
the
security
and
protection
of
persons
or
property
having
been
taken
either
by
the
state
of
panama
or
by
the
general
government
of
new
granada
under
the
guaranties
of
treaty
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
by
the
outlay
of
several
million
dollars
constructed
a
railroad
across
the
isthmus
and
it
has
become
the
main
route
between
our
atlantic
and
pacific
possessions
over
which
multitudes
of
our
citizens
and
a
vast
amount
of
property
are
constantly
passing
to
the
security
and
protection
of
all
which
and
the
continuance
of
the
public
advantages
involved
it
is
impossible
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
be
indifferent
i
have
deemed
the
danger
of
the
recurrence
of
scenes
of
lawless
violence
in
this
quarter
so
imminent
as
to
make
it
my
duty
to
station
a
part
of
our
naval
force
in
the
harbors
of
panama
and
aspinwall
in
order
to
protect
the
persons
and
property
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
those
ports
and
to
insure
to
them
safe
passage
across
the
isthmus
and
it
would
in
my
judgment
be
unwise
to
withdraw
the
naval
force
now
in
those
ports
until
by
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
republic
of
new
granada
or
otherwise
some
adequate
arrangement
shall
have
been
made
for
the
protection
and
security
of
a
line
of
interoceanic
communication
so
important
at
this
time
not
to
the
united
states
only
but
to
all
other
maritime
states
both
of
europe
and
america
meanwhile
negotiations
have
been
instituted
by
means
of
a
special
commission
to
obtain
from
new
granada
full
indemnity
for
injuries
sustained
by
our
citizens
on
the
isthmus
and
satisfactory
security
for
the
general
interests
of
the
united
states
in
addressing
to
you
my
last
annual
message
the
occasion
seems
to
me
an
appropriate
one
to
express
my
congratulations
in
view
of
the
peace
greatness
and
felicity
which
the
united
states
now
possess
and
enjoy
to
point
you
to
the
state
of
the
various
departments
of
the
government
and
of
all
the
great
branches
of
the
public
service
civil
and
military
in
order
to
speak
of
the
intelligence
and
the
integrity
which
pervades
the
whole
would
be
to
indicate
but
imperfectly
the
administrative
condition
of
the
country
and
the
beneficial
effects
of
that
on
the
general
welfare
nor
would
it
suffice
to
say
that
the
nation
is
actually

at
peace
at
home
and
abroad
that
its
industrial
interests
are
prosperous
that
the
canvas
of
its
mariners
whitens
every
sea
and
the
plow
of
its
husbandmen
is
marching
steadily
onward
to
the
bloodless
conquest
of
the
continent
that
cities
and
populous
states
are
springing
up
as
if
by
enchantment
from
the
bosom
of
oar
western
wilds
and
that
the
courageous
energy
of
our
people
is
making
of
these
united
states
the
great
republic
of
the
world
these
results
have
not
been
attained
without
passing
through
trials
and
perils
by
experience
of
which
and
thus
only
nations
can
harden
into
manhood
our
forefathers
were
trained
to
the
wisdom
which
conceived
and
the
courage
which
achieved
independence
by
the
circumstances
which
surrounded
them
and
they
were
thus
made
capable
of
the
creation
of
the
republic
it
devolved
on
the
next
generation
to
consolidate
the
work
of
the
revolution
to
deliver
the
country
entirely
from
the
influences
of
conflicting
transatlantic
partialities
or
antipathies
which
attached
to
our
colonial
and
revolutionary
history
and
to
organize
the
practical
operation
of
the
constitutional
and
legal
institutions
of
the
union
to
us
of
this
generation
remains
the
not
less
noble
task
of
maintaining
and
extending
the
national
power
we
have
at
length
reached
that
stage
of
our
countrys
career
in
which
the
dangers
to
be
encountered
and
the
exertions
to
be
made
are
the
incidents
not
of
weakness
but
of
strength
in
foreign
relations
we
have
to
attemper
our
power
to
the
less
happy
condition
of
other
republics
in
america
and
to
place
ourselves
in
the
calmness
and
conscious
dignity
of
right
by
the
side
of
the
greatest
and
wealthiest
of
the
empires
of
europe
in
domestic
relations
we
have
to
guard
against
the
shock
of
the
discontents
the
ambitions
the
interests
and
the
exuberant
and
therefore
sometimes
irregular
impulses
of
opinion
or
of
action
which
are
the
natural
product
of
the
present
political
elevation
the
selfreliance
and
the
restless
spirit
of
enterprise
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
shall
prepare
to
surrender
the
executive
trust
to
my
successor
and
retire
to
private
life
with
sentiments
of
profound
gratitude
to
the
good
providence
which
during
the
period
of
my
administration
has
vouchsafed
to
carry
the
country
through
many
difficulties
domestic
and
foreign
and
which
enables
me
to
contemplate
the
spectacle
of
amicable
and
respectful
relations
between
ours
and
all
other
governments
and
the
establishment
of
constitutional
order
and
tranquillity
throughout
the
union

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
provides
that
congress
shall
assemble
annually
on
the
first
monday
of
december
and
it
has
been
usual
for
the
president
to
make
no
communication
of
a
public
character
to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
until
advised
of
their
readiness
to
receive
it
i
have
deferred
to
this
usage
until
the
close
of
the
first
month
of
the
session
but
my
convictions
of
duty
will
not
permit
me
longer
to
postpone
the
discharge
of
the
obligation
enjoined
by
the
constitution
upon
the
president
to
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommend
to
their
consideration
such
measures
as
he
shall
judge
necessary
and
expedient
it
is
matter
of
congratulation
that
the
republic
is
tranquilly
advancing
in
a
career
of
prosperity
and
peace
whilst
relations
of
amity
continue
to
exist
between
the
united
states
and
all
foreign
powers
with
some
of
them
grave
questions
are
depending
which
may
require
the
consideration
of
congress
of
such
questions
the
most
important
is
that
which
has
arisen
out
of
the
negotiations
with
great
britain
in
reference
to
central
america
by
the
convention
concluded
between
the
two
governments
on
the
th
of
april
both
parties
covenanted
that
neither
will
ever
occupy
or
fortify
or
colonize
or
assume
or
exercise
any
dominion
over
nicaragua
costa
rica
the
mosquito
coast
or
any
part
of
central
america
it
was
the
undoubted
understanding
of
the
united
states
in
making
this
treaty
that
all
the
present
states
of
the
former
republic
of
central
america
and
the
entire
territory
of
each
would
thenceforth
enjoy
complete
independence
and
that
both
contracting
parties
engaged
equally
and
to
the
same
extent
for
the
present
and
for
the
future
that
if
either
then
had
any
claim
of
right
in
central
america
such
claim
and
all
occupation
or
authority
under
it
were
unreservedly
relinquished
by
the
stipulations
of
the
convention
and
that
no
dominion
was
thereafter
to
be
exercised
or
assumed
in
any
part
of
central
america
by
great
britain
or
the
united
states
this
government
consented
to
restrictions
in
regard
to
a
region
of
country
wherein
we
had
specific
and
peculiar
interests
only
upon
the
conviction
that
the
like
restrictions
were
in
the
same
sense
obligatory
on
great
britain
but
for
this
understanding
of
the
force
and
effect
of
the
convention
it
would
never
have
been
concluded
by
us
so
clear
was
this
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
that
in
correspondence
contemporaneous
with
the
ratification
of
the
convention
it
was
distinctly
expressed
that
the
mutual
covenants
of
nonoccupation
were
not
intended
to
apply
to
the
british
establishment
at
the
balize
this
qualification
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
fact
that
in
virtue
of
successive
treaties
with
previous
sovereigns
of
the
country
great
britain
had
obtained
a
concession
of
the
right
to
cut
mahogany
or
dyewoods
at
the
balize
but
with
positive
exclusion
of
all
domain
or
sovereignty
and
thus
it
confirms
the
natural
construction
and
understood
import
of
the
treaty
as
to
all
the
rest
of
the
region
to
which
the
stipulations
applied
it
however
became
apparent
at
an
early
day
after
entering
upon
the
discharge
of
my
present
functions
that
great
britain
still
continued
in
the
exercise
or
assertion
of
large
authority
in
all
that
part
of
central
america
commonly
called
the
mosquito
coast
and
covering
the
entire
length
of
the
state
of
nicaragua
and
a
part
of
costa
rica
that
she
regarded
the
balize
as
her
absolute
domain
and
was
gradually
extending
its
limits
at
the
expense
of
the
state
of
honduras
and
that
she
had
formally
colonized
a
considerable
insular
group
known
as
the
bay
islands
and
belonging
of
right
to
that
state
all
these
acts
or
pretensions
of
great
britain
being
contrary
to
the
rights
of
the
states
of
central
america
and
to
the
manifest
tenor
of
her
stipulations
with
the
united
states
as
understood
by
this
government
have
been
made
the
subject
of
negotiation
through
the
american
minister
in
london
i
transmit
herewith
the
instructions
to
him
on
the
subject
and
the
correspondence
between
him
and
the
british
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
by
which
you
will
perceive
that
the
two
governments
differ
widely
and
irreconcilably
as
to
the
construction
of
the
convention
and
its
effect
on
their
respective
relations
to
central
america
great
britain
so
construes
the
convention
as
to
maintain
unchanged
all
her
previous
pretensions
over
the
mosquito
coast
and
in
different
parts
of
central
america
these
pretensions
as
to
the
mosquito
coast
are
founded
on
the
assumption
of
political
relation
between
great
britain
and
the
remnant
of
a
tribe
of
indians
on
that
coast
entered
into
at
a
time
when
the
whole
country
was
a
colonial
possession
of
spain
it
can
not
be
successfully
controverted
that
by
the
public
law
of
europe
and
america
no
possible
act
of
such
indians
or
their
predecessors
could
confer
on
great
britain
any
political
rights
great
britain
does
not
allege
the
assent
of
spain
as
the
origin
of
her
claims
on
the
mosquito
coast
she
has
on
the
contrary
by
repeated
and
successive
treaties
renounced
and
relinquished
all
pretensions
of
her
own
and
recognized
the
full
and
sovereign
rights
of
spain
in
the
most
unequivocal
terms
yet
these
pretensions
so
without
solid
foundation
in
the
beginning
and
thus
repeatedly
abjured
were
at
a
recent
period
revived
by
great
britain
against
the
central
american
states
the
legitimate
successors
to
all
the
ancient
jurisdiction
of
spain
in
that
region
they
were
first
applied
only
to
a
defined
part
of
the
coast
of
nicaragua
afterwards
to
the
whole
of
its
atlantic
coast
and
lastly
to
a
part
of
the
coast
of
costa
rica
and
they
are
now
reasserted
to
this
extent
notwithstanding
engagements
to
the
united
states
on
the
eastern
coast
of
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
the
interference
of
great
britain
though
exerted
at
one
time
in
the
form
of
military
occupation
of
the
port
of
san
juan
del
norte
then
in
the
peaceful
possession
of
the
appropriate
authorities
of
the
central
american
states
is
now
presented
by
her
as
the
rightful
exercise
of
a
protectorship
over
the
mosquito
tribe
of
indians
but
the
establishment
at
the
balize
now
reaching
far
beyond
its
treaty
limits
into
the
state
of
honduras
and
that
of
the
bay
islands
appertaining
of
right
to
the
same
state
are
as
distinctly
colonial
governments
as
those
of
jamaica
or
canada
and
therefore
contrary
to
the
very
letter
as
well
as
the
spirit
of
the
convention
with
the
united
states
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
ratification
and
now
is
understood
by
this
government
the
interpretation
which
the
british
government
thus
in
assertion
and
act
persists
in
ascribing
to
the
convention
entirely
changes
its
character
while
it
holds
us
to
all
our
obligations
it
in
a
great
measure
releases
great
britain
from
those
which
constituted
the
consideration
of
this
government
for
entering
into
the
convention
it
is
impossible
in
my
judgment
for
the
united
states
to
acquiesce
in
such
a
construction
of
the
respective
relations
of
the
two
governments
to
central
america
to
a
renewed
call
by
this
government
upon
great
britain
to
abide
by
and
carry
into
effect
the
stipulations
of
the
convention
according
to
its
obvious
import
by
withdrawing
from
the
possession
or
colonization
of
portions
of
the
central
american
states
of
honduras
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
the
british
government
has
at
length
replied
affirming
that
the
operation
of
the
treaty
is
prospective
only
and
did
not
require
great
britain
to
abandon
or
contract
any
possessions
held
by
her
in
central
america
at
the
date
of
its
conclusion
this
reply
substitutes
a
partial
issue
in
the
place
of
the
general
one
presented
by
the
united
states
the
british
government
passes
over
the
question
of
the
rights
of
great
britain
real
or
supposed
in
central
america
and
assumes
that
she
had
such
rights
at
the
date
of
the
treaty
and
that
those
rights
comprehended
the
protectorship
of
the
mosquito
indians
the
extended
jurisdiction
and
limits
of
the
balize
and
the
colony
of
the
bay
islands
and
thereupon
proceeds
by
implication
to
infer
that
if
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
be
merely
future
in
effect
great
britain
may
still
continue
to
hold
the
contested
portions
of
central
america
the
united
states
can
not
admit
either
the
inference
or
the
premises
we
steadily
deny
that
at
the
date
of
the
treaty
great
britain
had
any
possessions
there
other
than
the
limited
and
peculiar
establishment
at
the
balize
and
maintain
that
if
she
had
any
they
were
surrendered
by
the
convention
this
government
recognizing
the
obligations
of
the
treaty
has
of
course
desired
to
see
it
executed
in
good
faith
by
both
parties
and
in
the
discussion
therefore
has
not
looked
to
rights
which
we
might
assert
independently
of
the
treaty
in
consideration
of
our
geographical
position
and
of
other
circumstances
which
create
for
us
relations
to
the
central
american
states
different
from
those
of
any
government
of
europe
the
british
government
in
its
last
communication
although
well
knowing
the
views
of
the
united
states
still
declares
that
it
sees
no
reason
why
a
conciliatory
spirit
may
not
enable
the
two
governments
to
overcome
all
obstacles
to
a
satisfactory
adjustment
of
the
subject
assured
of
the
correctness
of
the
construction
of
the
treaty
constantly
adhered
to
by
this
government
and
resolved
to
insist
on
the
rights
of
the
united
states
yet
actuated
also
by
the
same
desire
which
is
avowed
by
the
british
government
to
remove
all
causes
of
serious
misunderstanding
between
two
nations
associated
by
so
many
ties
of
interest
and
kindred
it
has
appeared
to
me
proper
not
to
consider
an
amicable
solution
of
the
controversy
hopeless
there
is
however
reason
to
apprehend
that
with
great
britain
in
the
actual
occupation
of
the
disputed
territories
and
the
treaty
therefore
practically
null
so
far
as
regards
our
rights
this
international
difficulty
can
not
long
remain
undetermined
without
involving
in
serious
danger
the
friendly
relations
which
it
is
the
inter
est
as
well
as
the
duty
of
both
countries
to
cherish
and
preserve
it
will
afford
me
sincere
gratification
if
future
efforts
shall
result
in
the
success
anticipated
heretofore
with
more
confidence
than
the
aspect
of
the
case
permits
me
now
to
entertain
one
other
subject
of
discussion
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
has
grown
out
of
the
attempt
which
the
exigencies
of
the
war
in
which
she
is
engaged
with
russia
induced
her
to
make
to
draw
recruits
from
the
united
states
it
is
the
traditional
and
settled
policy
of
the
united
states
to
maintain
impartial
neutrality
during
the
wars
which
from
time
to
time
occur
among
the
great
powers
of
the
world
performing
all
the
duties
of
neutrality
toward
the
respective
belligerent
states
we
may
reasonably
expect
them
not
to
interfere
with
our
lawful
enjoyment
of
its
benefits
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
such
hostilities
our
citizens
retained
the
individual
right
to
continue
all
their
accustomed
pursuits
by
land
or
by
sea
at
home
or
abroad
subject
only
to
such
restrictions
in
this
relation
as
the
laws
of
war
the
usage
of
nations
or
special
treaties
may
impose
and
it
is
our
sovereign
right
that
our
territory
and
jurisdiction
shall
not
be
invaded
by
either
of
the
belligerent
parties
for
the
transit
of
their
armies
the
operations
of
their
fleets
the
levy
of
troops
for
their
service
the
fitting
out
of
cruisers
by
or
against
either
or
any
other
act
or
incident
of
war
and
these
undeniable
rights
of
neutrality
individual
and
national
the
united
states
will
under
no
circumstances
surrender
in
pursuance
of
this
policy
the
laws
of
the
united
states
do
not
forbid
their
citizens
to
sell
to
either
of
the
belligerent
powers
articles
contraband
of
war
or
take
munitions
of
war
or
soldiers
on
board
their
private
ships
for
transportation
and
although
in
so
doing
the
individual
citizen
exposes
his
property
or
person
to
some
of
the
hazards
of
war
his
acts
do
not
involve
any
breach
of
national
neutrality
nor
of
themselves
implicate
the
government
thus
during
the
progress
of
the
present
war
in
europe
our
citizens
have
without
national
responsibility
therefor
sold
gunpowder
and
arms
to
all
buyers
regardless
of
the
destination
of
those
articles
our
merchantmen
have
been
and
still
continue
to
be
largely
employed
by
great
britain
and
by
france
in
transporting
troops
provisions
and
munitions
of
war
to
the
principal
seat
of
military
operations
and
in
bringing
home
their
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
but
such
use
of
our
mercantile
marine
is
not
interdicted
either
by
the
international
or
by
our
municipal
law
and
therefore
does
not
compromise
our
neutral
relations
with
russia
but
our
municipal
law
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
nations
peremptorily
forbids
not
only
foreigners
but
our
own
citizens
to
fit
out
within
the
united
states
a
vessel
to
commit
hostilities
against
any
state
with
which
the
united
states
are
at
peace
or
to
increase
the
force
of
any
foreign
armed
vessel
intended
for
such
hostilities
against
a
friendly
state
whatever
concern
may
have
been
felt
by
either
of
the
belligerent
powers
lest
private
armed
cruisers
or
other
vessels
in
the
service
of
one
might
be
fitted
out
in
the
ports
of
this
country
to
depredate
on
the
property
of
the
other
all
such
fears
have
proved
to
be
utterly
groundless
our
citizens
have
been
withheld
from
any
such
act
or
purpose
by
good
faith
and
by
respect
for
the
law
while
the
laws
of
the
union
are
thus
peremptory
in
their
prohibition
of
the
equipment
or
armament
of
belligerent
cruisers
in
our
ports
they
provide
not
less
absolutely
that
no
person
shall
within
the
territory
or
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
enlist
or
enter
himself
or
hire
or
retain
another
person
to
enlist
or
enter
himself
or
to
go
beyond
the
limits
or
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
with
intent
to
be
enlisted
or
entered
in
the
service
of
any
foreign
state
either
as
a
soldier
or
as
a
marine
or
seaman
on
board
of
any
vessel
of
war
letter
of
marque
or
privateer
and
these
enactments
are
also
in
strict
conformity
with
the
law
of
nations
which
declares
that
no
state
has
the
right
to
raise
troops
for
land
or
sea
service
in
another
state
without
its
consent
and
that
whether
forbidden
by
the
municipal
law
or
not
the
very
attempt
to
do
it
without
such
consent
is
an
attack
on
the
national
sovereignty
such
being
the
public
rights
and
the
municipal
law
of
the
united
states
no
solicitude
on
the
subject
was
entertained
by
this
government
when
a
year
since
the
british
parliament
passed
an
act
to
provide
for
the
enlistment
of
foreigners
in
the
military
service
of
great
britain
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
act
or
in
its
public
history
indicated
that
the
british
government
proposed
to
attempt
recruitment
in
the
united
states
nor
did
it
ever
give
intimation
of
such
intention
to
this
government
it
was
matter
of
surprise
therefore
to
find
subsequently
that
the
engagement
of
persons
within
the
united
states
to
proceed
to
halifax
in
the
british
province
of
nova
scotia
and
there
enlist
in
the
service
of
great
britain
was
going
on
extensively
with
little
or
no
disguise
ordinary
legal
steps
were
immediately
taken
to
arrest
and
punish
parties
concerned
and
so
put
an
end
to
acts
infringing
the
municipal
law
and
derogatory
to
our
sovereignty
meanwhile
suitable
representations
on
the
subject
were
addressed
to
the
british
government
thereupon
it
became
known
by
the
admission
of
the
british
government
itself
that
the
attempt
to
draw
recruits
from
this
country
originated
with
it
or
at
least
had
its
approval
and
sanction
but
it
also
appeared
that
the
public
agents
engaged
in
it
had
stringent
instructions
not
to
violate
the
municipal
law
of
the
united
states
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
it
should
have
been
supposed
that
troops
could
be
raised
here
by
great
britain
without
violation
of
the
municipal
law
the
unmistakable
object
of
the
law
was
to
prevent
every
such
act
which
if
performed
must
be
either
in
violation
of
the
law
or
in
studied
evasion
of
it
and
in
either
alternative
the
act
done
would
be
alike
injurious
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
in
the
meantime
the
matter
acquired
additional
importance
by
the
recruitments
in
the
united
states
not
being
discontinued
and
the
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
they
were
prosecuted
upon
a
systematic
plan
devised
by
official
authority
that
recruiting
rendezvous
had
been
opened
in
our
principal
cities
and
depots
for
the
reception
of
recruits
established
on
our
frontier
and
the
whole
business
conducted
under
the
supervision
and
by
the
regular
cooperation
of
british
officers
civil
and
military
some
in
the
north
american
provinces
and
some
in
the
united
states
the
complicity
of
those
officers
in
an
undertaking
which
could
only
be
accomplished
by
defying
our
laws
throwing
suspicion
over
our
attitude
of
neutrality
and
disregarding
our
territorial
rights
is
conclusively
proved
by
the
evidence
elicited
on
the
trial
of
such
of
their
agents
as
have
been
apprehended
and
convicted
some
of
the
officers
thus
implicated
are
of
high
official
position
and
many
of
them
beyond
our
jurisdiction
so
that
legal
proceedings
could
not
reach
the
source
of
the
mischief
these
considerations
and
the
fact
that
the
cause
of
complaint
was
not
a
mere
casual
occurrence
trot
a
deliberate
design
entered
upon
with
full
knowledge
of
our
laws
and
national
policy
and
conducted
by
responsible
public
functionaries
impelled
me
to
present
the
case
to
the
british
government
in
order
to
secure
not
only
a
cessation
of
the
wrong
but
its
reparation
the
subject
is
still
under
discussion
the
result
of
which
will
be
communicated
to
you
in
due
time
i
repeat
the
recommendation
submitted
to
the
last
congress
that
provision
be
made
for
the
appointment
of
a
commissioner
in
connection
with
great
britain
to
survey
and
establish
the
boundary
line
which
divides
the
territory
of
washington
from
the
contiguous
british
possessions
by
reason
of
the
extent
and
importance
of
the
country
in
dispute
there
has
been
imminent
danger
of
collision
between
the
subjects
of
great
britain
and
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
including
their
respective
authorities
in
that
quarter
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
arrangement
has
contributed
hitherto
to
induce
on
both
sides
forbearance
to
assert
by
force
what
each
claims
as
a
right
continuance
of
delay
on
the
part
of
the
two
governments
to
act
in
the
matter
will
increase
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
the
controversy
misunderstanding
exists
as
to
the
extent
character
and
value
of
the
possessory
rights
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
and
the
property
of
the
pugets
sound
agricultural
company
reserved
in
our
treaty
with
great
britain
relative
to
the
territory
of
oregon
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
cession
of
the
rights
of
both
companies
to
the
united
states
which
would
be
the
readiest
means
of
terminating
all
questions
can
be
obtained
on
reasonable
terms
and
with
a
view
to
this
end
i
present
the
subject
to
the
attention
of
congress
the
colony
of
newfoundland
having
enacted
the
laws
required
by
the
treaty
of
the
th
of
june
is
now
placed
on
the
same
footing
in
respect
to
commercial
intercourse
with
the
united
states
as
the
other
british
north
american
provinces
the
commission
which
that
treaty
contemplated
for
determining
the
rights
of
fishery
in
rivers
and
mouths
of
rivers
on
the
coasts
of
the
united
states
and
the
british
north
american
provinces
has
been
organized
and
has
commenced
its
labors
to
complete
which
there
are
needed
further
appropriations
for
the
service
of
another
season
in
pursuance
of
the
authority
conferred
by
a
resolution
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
passed
on
the
d
of
march
last
notice
was
given
to
denmark
on
the
th
day
of
april
of
the
intention
of
this
government
to
avail
itself
of
the
stipulation
of
the
subsisting
convention
of
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
between
that
kingdom
and
the
united
states
whereby
either
party
might
after
ten
years
terminate
the
same
at
the
expiration
of
one
year
from
the
date
of
notice
for
that
purpose
the
considerations
which
led
me
to
call
the
attention
o
f
congress
to
that
convention
and
induced
the
senate
to
adopt
the
resolution
referred
to
still
continue
in
full
force
the
convention
contains
an
article
which
although
it
does
not
directly
engage
the
united
states
to
submit
to
the
imposition
of
tolls
on
the
vessels
and
cargoes
of
americans
passing
into
or
from
the
baltic
sea
during
the
continuance
of
the
treaty
yet
may
by
possibility
be
construed
as
implying
such
submission
the
exaction
of
those
tolls
not
being
justified
by
any
principle
of
international
law
it
became
the
right
and
duty
of
the
united
states
to
relieve
themselves
from
the
implication
of
engagement
on
the
subject
so
as
to
be
perfectly
free
to
act
in
the
premises
in
such
way
as
their
public
interests
and
honor
shall
demand
i
remain
of
the
opinion
that
the
united
states
ought
not
to
submit
to
the
payment
of
the
sound
dues
not
so
much
because
of
their
amount
which
is
a
secondary
matter
but
because
it
is
in
effect
the
recognition
of
the
right
of
denmark
to
treat
one
of
the
great
maritime
highways
of
nations
as
a
close
sea
and
prevent
the
navigation
of
it
as
a
privilege
for
which
tribute
may
be
imposed
upon
those
who
have
occasion
to
use
it
this
government
on
a
former
occasion
not
unlike
the
present
signalized
its
determination
to
maintain
the
freedom
of
the
seas
and
of
the
great
natural
channels
of
navigation
the
barbary
states
had
for
a
long
time
coerced
the
payment
of
tribute
from
all
nations
whose
ships
frequented
the
mediterranean
to
the
last
demand
of
such
payment
made
by
them
the
united
states
although
suffering
less
by
their
depredations
than
many
other
nations
returned
the
explicit
answer
that
we
preferred
war
to
tribute
and
thus
opened
the
way
to
the
relief
of
the
commerce
of
the
world
from
an
ignominious
tax
so
long
submitted
to
by
the
more
powerful
nations
of
europe
if
the
manner
of
payment
of
the
sound
dues
differ
from
that
of
the
tribute
formerly
conceded
to
the
barbary
states
still
their
exaction
by
denmark
has
no
better
foundation
in
right
each
was
in
its
origin
nothing
but
a
tax
on
a
common
natural
right
extorted
by
those
who
were
at
that
time
able
to
obstruct
the
free
and
secure
enjoyment
of
it
but
who
no
longer
possess
that
power
denmark
while
resisting
our
assertion
of
the
freedom
of
the
baltic
sound
and
belts
has
indicated
a
readiness
to
make
some
new
arrangement
on
the
subject
and
has
invited
the
governments
interested
including
the
united
states
to
be
represented
in
a
convention
to
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
and
considering
a
proposition
which
she
intends
to
submit
for
the
capitalization
of
the
sound
dues
and
the
distribution
of
the
sum
to
be
paid
as
commutation
among
the
governments
according
to
the
respective
proportions
of
their
maritime
commerce
to
and
from
the
baltic
i
have
declined
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
to
accept
this
invitation
for
the
most
cogent
reasons
one
is
that
denmark
does
not
offer
to
submit
to
the
convention
the
question
of
her
right
to
levy
the
sound
dues
the
second
is
that
if
the
convention
were
allowed
to
take
cognizance
of
that
particular
question
still
it
would
not
be
competent
to
deal
with
the
great
international
principle
involved
which
affects
the
right
in
other
cases
of
navigation
and
commercial
freedom
as
well
as
that
of
access
to
the
baltic
above
all
by
the
express
terms
of
the
proposition
it
is
contemplated
that
the
consideration
of
the
sound
dues
shall
be
commingled
with
and
made
subordinate
to
a
matter
wholly
extraneousthe
balance
of
power
among
the
governments
of
europe
while
however
rejecting
this
proposition
and
insisting
on
the
right
of
free
transit
into
and
from
the
baltic
i
have
expressed
to
denmark
a
willingness
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
share
liberally
with
other
powers
in
compensating
her
for
any
advantages
which
commerce
shall
hereafter
derive
from
expenditures
made
by
her
for
the
improvement
and
safety
of
the
navigation
of
the
sound
or
belts
i
lay
before
you
herewith
sundry
documents
on
the
subject
in
which
my
views
are
more
fully
disclosed
should
no
satisfactory
arrangement
be
soon
concluded
i
shall
again
call
your
attention
to
the
subject
with
recommendation
of
such
measures
as
may
appear
to
be
required
in
order
to
assert
and
secure
the
rights
of
the
united
states
so
far
as
they
are
affected
by
the
pretensions
of
denmark
i
announce
with
much
gratification
that
since
the
adjournment
of
the
last
congress
the
question
then
existing
between
this
government
and
that
of
france
respecting
the
french
consul
at
san
francisco
has
been
satisfactorily
determined
and
that
the
relations
of
the
two
governments
continue
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
nature
a
question
also
which
has
been
pending
for
several
years
between
the
united
states
and
the
kingdom
of
greece
growing
out
of
the
sequestration
by
public
authorities
of
that
country
of
property
belonging
to
the
present
american
consul
at
athens
and
which
had
been
the
subject
of
very
earnest
discussion
heretofore
has
recently
been
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
party
interested
and
of
both
governments
with
spain
peaceful
relations
are
still
maintained
and
some
progress
has
been
made
in
securing
the
redress
of
wrongs
complained
of
by
this
government
spain
has
not
only
disavowed
and
disapproved
the
conduct
of
the
officers
who
illegally
seized
and
detained
the
steamer
black
warrior
at
havana
but
has
also
paid
the
sum
claimed
as
indemnity
for
the
loss
thereby
inflicted
on
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
consequence
of
a
destructive
hurricane
which
visited
cuba
in
the
supreme
authority
of
that
island
issued
a
decree
permitting
the
importation
for
the
period
of
six
months
of
certain
building
materials
and
provisions
free
of
duty
but
revoked
it
when
about
half
the
period
only
had
elapsed
to
the
injury
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
had
proceeded
to
act
on
the
faith
of
that
decree
the
spanish
government
refused
indemnification
to
the
parties
aggrieved
until
recently
when
it
was
assented
to
payment
being
promised
to
be
made
so
soon
as
the
amount
due
can
be
ascertained
satisfaction
claimed
for
the
arrest
and
search
of
the
steamer
el
dorado
has
not
yet
been
accorded
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
be
and
that
case
with
others
continues
to
be
urged
on
the
attention
of
the
spanish
government
i
do
not
abandon
the
hope
of
concluding
with
spain
some
general
arrangement
which
if
it
do
not
wholly
prevent
the
recurrence
of
difficulties
in
cuba
will
render
them
less
frequent
and
whenever
they
shall
occur
facilitate
their
more
speedy
settlement
the
interposition
of
this
government
has
been
invoked
by
many
of
its
citizens
on
account
of
injuries
done
to
their
persons
and
property
for
which
the
mexican
republic
is
responsible
the
unhappy
situation
of
that
country
for
some
time
past
has
not
allowed
its
government
to
give
due
consideration
to
claims
of
private
reparation
and
has
appeared
to
call
for
and
justify
some
forbearance
in
such
matters
on
the
part
of
this
government
but
if
the
revolutionary
movements
which
have
lately
occurred
in
that
republic
end
in
the
organization
of
a
stable
government
urgent
appeals
to
its
justice
will
then
be
made
and
it
may
be
hoped
with
success
for
the
redress
of
all
complaints
of
our
citizens
in
regard
to
the
american
republics
which
from
their
proximity
and
other
considerations
have
peculiar
relations
to
this
government
while
it
has
been
my
constant
aim
strictly
to
observe
all
the
obligations
of
political
friendship
and
of
good
neighborhood
obstacles
to
this
have
arisen
in
some
of
them
from
their
own
insufficient
power
to
cheek
lawless
irruptions
which
in
effect
throws
most
of
the
task
on
the
united
states
thus
it
is
that
the
distracted
internal
condition
of
the
state
of
nicaragua
has
made
it
incumbent
on
me
to
appeal
to
the
good
faith
of
our
citizens
to
abstain
from
unlawful
intervention
in
its
affairs
and
to
adopt
preventive
measures
to
the
same
end
which
on
a
similar
occasion
had
the
best
results
in
reassuring
the
peace
of
the
mexican
states
of
sonora
and
lower
california
since
the
last
session
of
congress
a
treaty
of
amity
commerce
and
navigation
and
for
the
surrender
of
fugitive
criminals
with
the
kingdom
of
the
two
sicilies
a
treaty
of
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
with
nicaragua
and
a
convention
of
commercial
reciprocity
with
the
hawaiian
kingdom
have
been
negotiated
the
latter
kingdom
and
the
state
of
nicaragua
have
also
acceded
to
a
declaration
recognizing
as
international
rights
the
principles
contained
in
the
convention
between
the
united
states
and
russia
of
july
these
treaties
and
conventions
will
be
laid
before
the
senate
for
ratification
the
statements
made
in
my
last
annual
message
respecting
the
anticipated
receipts
and
expenditures
of
the
treasury
have
been
substantially
verified
it
appears
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
the
receipts
during
the
last
fiscal
year
ending
june
from
all
sources
were
and
that
the
public
expenditures
for
the
same
period
exclusive
of
payments
on
account
of
the
public
debt
amounted
to
during
the
same
period
the
payments
made
in
redemption
of
the
public
debt
including
interest
and
premium
amounted
to
the
balance
in
the
treasury
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
fiscal
year
july
was
the
receipts
for
the
first
quarter
and
the
estimated
receipts
for
the
remaining
three
quarters
amount
together
to
thus
affording
in
all
as
the
available
resources
of
the
current
fiscal
year
the
sum
of
if
to
the
actual
expenditures
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
current
fiscal
year
be
added
the
probable
expenditures
for
the
remaining
three
quarters
as
estimated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
sum
total
will
be
thereby
leaving
an
estimated
balance
in
the
treasury
on
july
of
in
the
aboveestimated
expenditures
of
the
present
fiscal
year
are
included
to
meet
the
last
installment
of
the
ten
millions
provided
for
in
the
late
treaty
with
mexico
and
appropriated
on
account
of
the
debt
due
to
texas
which
two
sums
make
an
aggregate
amount
of
and
reduce
the
expenditures
actual
or
estimated
for
ordinary
objec
ts
of
the
year
to
the
sum
of
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
fiscal
year
was
and
deduction
being
made
of
subsequent
payments
the
whole
public
debt
of
the
federal
government
remaining
at
this
time
is
less
than
the
remnant
of
certain
other
government
stocks
amounting
to
referred
to
in
my
last
message
as
outstanding
has
since
been
paid
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
devise
a
system
superior
to
that
by
which
the
fiscal
business
of
the
government
is
now
conducted
notwithstanding
the
great
number
of
public
agents
of
collection
and
disbursement
it
is
believed
that
the
checks
and
guards
provided
including
the
requirement
of
monthly
returns
render
it
scarcely
possible
for
any
considerable
fraud
on
the
part
of
those
agents
or
neglect
involving
hazard
of
serious
public
loss
to
escape
detection
i
renew
however
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
by
me
of
the
enactment
of
a
law
declaring
it
felony
on
the
part
of
public
officers
to
insert
false
entries
in
their
books
of
record
or
account
or
to
make
false
returns
and
also
requiring
them
on
the
termination
of
their
service
to
deliver
to
their
successors
all
books
records
and
other
objects
of
a
public
nature
in
their
custody
derived
as
our
public
revenue
is
in
chief
part
from
duties
on
imports
its
magnitude
affords
gratifying
evidence
of
the
prosperity
not
only
of
our
commerce
but
of
the
other
great
interests
upon
which
that
depends
the
principle
that
all
moneys
not
required
for
the
current
expenses
of
the
government
should
remain
for
active
employment
in
the
hands
of
the
people
and
the
conspicuous
fact
that
the
annual
revenue
from
all
sources
exceeds
by
many
millions
of
dollars
the
amount
needed
for
a
prudent
and
economical
administration
of
public
affairs
can
not
fail
to
suggest
the
propriety
of
an
early
revision
and
reduction
of
the
tariff
of
duties
on
imports
it
is
now
so
generally
conceded
that
the
purpose
of
revenue
alone
can
justify
the
imposition
of
duties
on
imports
that
in
readjusting
the
impost
tables
and
schedules
which
unquestionably
require
essential
modifications
a
departure
from
the
principles
of
the
present
tariff
is
not
anticipated
the
army
during
the
past
year
has
been
actively
engaged
in
defending
the
indian
frontier
the
state
of
the
service
permitting
but
few
and
small
garrisons
in
our
permanent
fortifications
the
additional
regiments
authorized
at
the
last
session
of
congress
have
been
recruited
and
organized
and
a
large
portion
of
the
troops
have
already
been
sent
to
the
field
all
the
duties
which
devolve
on
the
military
establishment
have
been
satisfactorily
performed
and
the
dangers
and
privations
incident
to
the
character
of
the
service
required
of
our
troops
have
furnished
additional
evidence
of
their
courage
zeal
and
capacity
to
meet
any
requisition
which
their
country
may
make
upon
them
for
the
details
of
the
military
operations
the
distribution
of
the
troops
and
additional
provisions
required
for
the
military
service
i
refer
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
accompanying
documents
experience
gathered
from
events
which
have
transpired
since
my
last
annual
message
has
but
served
to
confirm
the
opinion
then
expressed
of
the
propriety
of
making
provision
by
a
retired
list
for
disabled
officers
and
for
increased
compensation
to
the
officers
retained
on
the
list
for
active
duty
all
the
reasons
which
existed
when
these
measures
were
recommended
on
former
occasions
continue
without
modification
except
so
far
as
circumstances
have
given
to
some
of
them
additional
force
the
recommendations
heretofore
made
for
a
partial
reorganization
of
the
army
are
also
renewed
the
thorough
elementary
education
given
to
those
officers
who
commenced
their
service
with
the
grade
of
cadet
qualifies
them
to
a
considerable
extent
to
perform
the
duties
of
every
arm
of
the
service
but
to
give
the
highest
efficiency
to
artillery
requires
the
practice
and
special
study
of
many
years
and
it
is
not
therefore
believed
to
be
advisable
to
maintain
in
time
of
peace
a
larger
force
of
that
arm
than
can
be
usually
employed
in
the
duties
appertaining
to
the
service
of
field
and
siege
artillery
the
duties
of
the
staff
in
all
its
various
branches
belong
to
the
movements
of
troops
and
the
efficiency
of
an
army
in
the
field
would
materially
depend
upon
the
ability
with
which
those
duties
are
discharged
it
is
not
as
in
the
case
of
the
artillery
a
specialty
but
requires
also
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
duties
of
an
officer
of
the
line
and
it
is
not
doubted
that
to
complete
the
education
of
an
officer
for
either
the
line
or
the
general
staff
it
is
desirable
that
he
shall
have
served
in
both
with
this
view
it
was
recommended
on
a
former
occasion
that
the
duties
of
the
staff
should
be
mainly
performed
by
details
from
the
line
and
with
conviction
of
the
advantages
which
would
result
from
such
a
change
it
is
again
presented
for
the
consideration
of
congress
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
herewith
submitted
exhibits
in
full
the
naval
operations
of
the
past
year
together
with
the
present
condition
of
the
service
and
it
makes
suggestions
of
further
legislation
to
which
your
attention
is
invited
the
construction
of
the
six
steam
frigates
for
which
appropriations
were
made
by
the
last
congress
has
proceeded
in
the
most
satisfactory
manner
and
with
such
expedition
as
to
warrant
the
belief
that
they
will
be
ready
for
service
early
in
the
coming
spring
important
as
this
addition
to
our
naval
force
is
it
still
remains
inadequate
to
the
contingent
exigencies
of
the
protection
of
the
extensive
seacoast
and
vast
commercial
interests
of
the
united
states
in
view
of
this
fact
and
of
the
acknowledged
wisdom
of
the
policy
of
a
gradual
and
systematic
increase
of
the
navy
an
appropriation
is
recommended
for
the
construction
of
six
steam
sloops
of
war
in
regard
to
the
steps
taken
in
execution
of
the
act
of
congress
to
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
navy
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
more
than
to
express
entire
concurrence
in
the
observations
on
that
subject
presented
by
the
secretary
in
his
report
it
will
be
perceived
by
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
that
the
gross
expenditure
of
the
department
for
the
last
fiscal
year
was
and
the
gross
receipts
making
an
excess
of
expenditure
over
receipts
of
and
that
the
cost
of
mail
transportation
during
that
year
was
greater
than
the
previous
year
much
of
the
heavy
expenditures
to
which
the
treasury
is
thus
subjected
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
large
quantity
of
printed
matter
conveyed
by
the
mails
either
franked
or
liable
to
no
postage
by
law
or
to
very
low
rates
of
postage
compared
with
that
charged
on
letters
and
to
the
great
cost
of
mail
service
on
railroads
and
by
ocean
steamers
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
on
the
subject
deserve
the
consideration
of
congress
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
will
engage
your
attention
as
well
for
useful
suggestions
it
contains
as
for
the
interest
and
importance
of
the
subjects
to
which
they
refer
the
aggregate
amount
of
public
land
sold
during
the
last
fiscal
year
located
with
military
scrip
or
land
warrants
taken
up
under
grants
for
roads
and
selected
as
swamp
lands
by
states
is
acres
of
which
the
portion
sold
was
acres
yielding
in
receipts
the
sum
of
in
the
same
period
of
time
acres
have
been
surveyed
but
in
consideration
of
the
quantity
already
subject
to
entry
no
additional
tracts
have
been
brought
into
market
the
peculiar
relation
of
the
general
government
to
the
district
of
columbia
renders
it
proper
to
commend
to
your
care
not
only
its
material
but
also
its
moral
interests
including
education
more
especially
in
those
parts
of
the
district
outside
of
the
cities
of
washington
and
georgetown
the
commissioners
appointed
to
revise
and
codify
the
laws
of
the
district
have
made
such
progress
in
the
performance
of
their
task
as
to
insure
its
completion
in
the
time
prescribed
by
the
act
of
congress
information
has
recently
been
received
that
the
peace
of
the
settlements
in
the
territories
of
oregon
and
washington
is
disturbed
by
hostilities
on
the
part
of
the
indians
with
indications
of
extensive
combinations
of
a
hostile
character
among
the
tribes
in
that
quarter
the
more
serious
in
their
possible
effect
by
reason
of
the
undetermined
foreign
interests
existing
in
those
territories
to
which
your
attention
has
already
been
especially
invited
efficient
measures
have
been
taken
which
it
is
believed
will
restore
quiet
and
afford
protection
to
our
citizens
in
the
territory
of
kansas
there
have
been
acts
prejudicial
to
good
order
but
as
yet
none
have
occurred
under
circumstances
to
justify
the
interposition
of
the
federal
executive
that
could
only
be
in
case
of
obstruction
to
federal
law
or
of
organized
resistance
to
territorial
law
assuming
the
character
of
insurrection
which
if
it
should
occur
it
would
be
my
duty
promptly
to
overcome
and
suppress
i
cherish
the
hope
however
that
the
occurrence
of
any
such
untoward
event
will
be
prevented
by
the
sound
sense
of
the
people
of
the
territory
who
by
its
organic
law
possessing
the
right
to
determine
their
own
domestic
institutions
are
entitled
while
deporting
themselves
peacefully
to
the
free
exercise
of
that
right
and
must
be
protected
in
the
enjoyment
of
it
without
interference
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
of
any
of
the
states
the
southern
boundary
line
of
this
territory
has
never
been
surveyed
and
established
the
rapidly
extending
settlements
in
that
region
and
the
fact
that
the
main
route
between
independence
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
new
mexico
is
contiguous
in
this
line
suggest
the
probability
that
embarrassing
questions
of
jurisdiction
may
consequently
arise
for
these
and
other
considerations
i
commend
the
subject
to
your
early
attention
i
have
thus
passed
in
review
the
general
state
of
the
union
including
such
particular
concerns
of
the
federal
government
whether
of
domestic
or
foreign
relation
as
it
appeared
to
me
desirable
and
useful
to
bring
to
the
special
notice
of
congress
unlike
the
great
sta
tes
of
europe
and
asia
and
many
of
those
of
america
these
united
states
are
wasting
their
strength
neither
in
foreign
war
nor
domestic
strife
whatever
of
discontent
or
public
dissatisfaction
exists
is
attributable
to
the
imperfections
of
human
nature
or
is
incident
to
all
governments
however
perfect
which
human
wisdom
can
devise
such
subjects
of
political
agitation
as
occupy
the
public
mind
consist
to
a
great
extent
of
exaggeration
of
inevitable
evils
or
over
zeal
in
social
improvement
or
mere
imagination
of
grievance
having
but
remote
connection
with
any
of
the
constitutional
functions
or
duties
of
the
federal
government
to
whatever
extent
these
questions
exhibit
a
tendency
menacing
to
the
stability
of
the
constitution
or
the
integrity
of
the
union
and
no
further
they
demand
the
consideration
of
the
executive
and
require
to
be
presented
by
him
to
congress
before
the
thirteen
colonies
became
a
confederation
of
independent
states
they
were
associated
only
by
community
of
transatlantic
origin
by
geographical
position
and
by
the
mutual
tie
of
common
dependence
on
great
britain
when
that
tie
was
sundered
they
severally
assumed
the
powers
and
rights
of
absolute
selfgovernment
the
municipal
and
social
institutions
of
each
its
laws
of
property
and
of
personal
relation
even
its
political
organization
were
such
only
as
each
one
chose
to
establish
wholly
without
interference
from
any
other
in
the
language
of
the
declaration
of
independence
each
state
had
full
power
to
levy
war
conclude
peace
contract
alliances
establish
commerce
and
to
do
all
other
acts
and
things
which
independent
states
may
of
right
do
the
several
colonies
differed
in
climate
in
soil
in
natural
productions
in
religion
in
systems
of
education
in
legislation
and
in
the
forms
of
political
administration
and
they
continued
to
differ
in
these
respects
when
they
voluntarily
allied
themselves
as
states
to
carry
on
the
war
of
the
revolution
the
object
of
that
war
was
to
disenthrall
the
united
colonies
from
foreign
rule
which
had
proved
to
be
oppressive
and
to
separate
them
permanently
from
the
mother
country
the
political
result
was
the
foundation
of
a
federal
republic
of
the
free
white
men
of
the
colonies
constituted
as
they
were
in
distinct
and
reciprocally
independent
state
governments
as
for
the
subject
races
whether
indian
or
african
the
wise
and
brave
statesmen
of
that
day
being
engaged
in
no
extravagant
scheme
of
social
change
left
them
as
they
were
and
thus
preserved
themselves
and
their
posterity
from
the
anarchy
and
the
everrecurring
civil
wars
which
have
prevailed
in
other
revolutionized
european
colonies
of
america
when
the
confederated
states
found
it
convenient
to
modify
the
conditions
of
their
association
by
giving
to
the
general
government
direct
access
in
some
respects
to
the
people
of
the
states
instead
of
confining
it
to
action
on
the
states
as
such
they
proceeded
to
frame
the
existing
constitution
adhering
steadily
to
one
guiding
thought
which
was
to
delegate
only
such
power
as
was
necessary
and
proper
to
the
execution
of
specific
purposes
or
in
other
words
to
retain
as
much
as
possible
consistently
with
those
purposes
of
the
independent
powers
of
the
individual
states
for
objects
of
common
defense
and
security
they
intrusted
to
the
general
government
certain
carefully
defined
functions
leaving
all
others
as
the
undelegated
rights
of
the
separate
independent
sovereignties
such
is
the
constitutional
theory
of
our
government
the
practical
observance
of
which
has
carried
us
and
us
alone
among
modern
republics
through
nearly
three
generations
of
time
without
the
cost
of
one
drop
of
blood
shed
in
civil
war
with
freedom
and
concert
of
action
it
has
enabled
us
to
contend
successfully
on
the
battlefield
against
foreign
foes
has
elevated
the
feeble
colonies
into
powerful
states
and
has
raised
our
industrial
productions
and
our
commerce
which
transports
them
to
the
level
of
the
richest
and
the
greatest
nations
of
europe
and
the
admirable
adaptation
of
our
political
institutions
to
their
objects
combining
local
selfgovernment
with
aggregate
strength
has
established
the
practicability
of
a
government
like
ours
to
cover
a
continent
with
confederate
states
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
in
effect
that
congress
of
sovereignties
which
good
men
in
the
old
world
have
sought
for
but
could
never
attain
and
which
imparts
to
america
an
exemption
from
the
mutable
leagues
for
common
action
from
the
wars
the
mutual
invasions
and
vague
aspirations
after
the
balance
of
power
which
convulse
from
time
to
time
the
governments
of
europe
our
cooperative
action
rests
in
the
conditions
of
permanent
confederation
prescribed
by
the
constitution
our
balance
of
power
is
in
the
separate
reserved
rights
of
the
states
and
their
equal
representation
in
the
senate
that
independent
sovereignty
in
every
one
of
the
states
with
its
reserved
rights
of
local
selfgovernment
assured
to
each
by
their
coequal
power
in
the
senate
was
the
fundamental
condition
of
the
constitution
without
it
the
union
would
never
have
existed
however
desirous
the
larger
states
might
be
to
reorganize
the
government
so
as
to
give
to
their
population
its
proportionate
weight
in
the
common
counsels
they
knew
it
was
impossible
unless
they
conceded
to
the
smaller
ones
authority
to
exercise
at
least
a
negative
influence
on
all
the
measures
of
the
government
whether
legislative
or
executive
through
their
equal
representation
in
the
senate
indeed
the
larger
states
themselves
could
not
have
failed
to
perceive
that
the
same
power
was
equally
necessary
to
them
for
the
security
of
their
own
domestic
interests
against
the
aggregate
force
of
the
general
government
in
a
word
the
original
states
went
into
this
permanent
league
on
the
agreed
premises
of
exerting
their
common
strength
for
the
defense
of
the
whole
and
of
all
its
parts
but
of
utterly
excluding
all
capability
of
reciprocal
aggression
each
solemnly
bound
itself
to
all
the
others
neither
to
undertake
nor
permit
any
encroachment
upon
or
intermeddling
with
anothers
reserved
rights
where
it
was
deemed
expedient
particular
rights
of
the
states
were
expressly
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
but
in
all
things
besides
these
rights
were
guarded
by
the
limitation
of
the
powers
granted
and
by
express
reservation
of
all
powers
not
granted
in
the
compact
of
union
thus
the
great
power
of
taxation
was
limited
to
purposes
of
common
defense
and
general
welfare
excluding
objects
appertaining
to
the
local
legislation
of
the
several
states
and
those
purposes
of
general
welfare
and
common
defense
were
afterwards
defined
by
specific
enumeration
as
being
matters
only
of
corelation
between
the
states
themselves
or
between
them
and
foreign
governments
which
because
of
their
common
and
general
nature
could
not
be
left
to
the
separate
control
of
each
state
of
the
circumstances
of
local
condition
interest
and
rights
in
which
a
portion
of
the
states
constituting
one
great
section
of
the
union
differed
from
the
rest
and
from
another
section
the
most
important
was
the
peculiarity
of
a
larger
relative
colored
population
in
the
southern
than
in
the
northern
states
a
population
of
this
class
held
in
subjection
existed
in
nearly
all
the
states
but
was
more
numerous
and
of
more
serious
concernment
in
the
south
than
in
the
north
on
account
of
natural
differences
of
climate
and
production
and
it
was
foreseen
that
for
the
same
reasons
while
this
population
would
diminish
and
sooner
or
later
cease
to
exist
in
some
states
it
might
increase
in
others
the
peculiar
character
and
magnitude
of
this
question
of
local
rights
not
in
material
relations
only
but
still
more
in
social
ones
caused
it
to
enter
into
the
special
stipulations
of
the
constitution
hence
while
the
general
government
as
well
by
the
enumerated
powers
granted
to
it
as
by
those
not
enumerated
and
therefore
refused
to
it
was
forbidden
to
touch
this
matter
in
the
sense
of
attack
or
offense
it
was
placed
under
the
general
safeguard
of
the
union
in
the
sense
of
defense
against
either
invasion
or
domestic
violence
like
all
other
local
interests
of
the
several
states
each
state
expressly
stipulated
as
well
for
itself
as
for
each
and
all
of
its
citizens
and
every
citizen
of
each
state
became
solemnly
bound
by
his
allegiance
to
the
constitution
that
any
person
held
to
service
or
labor
in
one
state
escaping
into
another
should
not
in
consequence
of
any
law
or
regulation
thereof
be
discharged
from
such
service
or
labor
but
should
be
delivered
up
on
claim
of
the
party
to
whom
such
service
or
labor
might
be
due
by
the
laws
of
his
state
thus
and
thus
only
by
the
reciprocal
guaranty
of
all
the
rights
of
every
state
against
interference
on
the
part
of
another
was
the
present
form
of
government
established
by
our
fathers
and
transmitted
to
us
and
by
no
other
means
is
it
possible
for
it
to
exist
if
one
state
ceases
to
respect
the
rights
of
another
and
obtrusively
intermeddles
with
its
local
interests
if
a
portion
of
the
states
assume
to
impose
their
institutions
on
the
others
or
refuse
to
fulfill
their
obligations
to
them
we
are
no
longer
united
friendly
states
but
distracted
hostile
ones
with
little
capacity
left
of
common
advantage
but
abundant
means
of
reciprocal
injury
and
mischief
practically
it
is
immaterial
whether
aggressive
interference
between
the
states
or
deliberate
refusal
on
the
part
of
any
one
of
them
to
comply
with
constitutional
obligations
arise
from
erroneous
conviction
or
blind
prejudice
whether
it
be
perpetrated
by
direction
or
indirection
in
either
case
it
is
full
of
threat
and
of
danger
to
the
durability
of
the
union
placed
in
the
office
of
chief
magistrate
as
the
executive
agent
of
the
whole
country
bound
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
and
specially
enjoined
by
the
constitution
to
give
information
to
congress
on
the
state
of
the
union
it
would
be
palpable
neglect
of
duty
on
my
part
to
pass
over
a
subject
like
this
which
beyond
all
things
at
the
present
time
vitally
concerns
individual
and
public
security
it
has
bee
n
matter
of
painful
regret
to
see
states
conspicuous
for
their
services
in
rounding
this
republic
and
equally
sharing
its
advantages
disregard
their
constitutional
obligations
to
it
although
conscious
of
their
inability
to
heal
admitted
and
palpable
social
evils
of
their
own
and
which
are
completely
within
their
jurisdiction
they
engage
in
the
offensive
and
hopeless
undertaking
of
reforming
the
domestic
institutions
of
other
states
wholly
beyond
their
control
and
authority
in
the
vain
pursuit
of
ends
by
them
entirely
unattainable
and
which
they
may
not
legally
attempt
to
compass
they
peril
the
very
existence
of
the
constitution
and
all
the
countless
benefits
which
it
has
conferred
while
the
people
of
the
southern
states
confine
their
attention
to
their
own
affairs
not
presuming
officiously
to
intermeddle
with
the
social
institutions
of
the
northern
states
too
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
latter
are
permanently
organized
in
associations
to
inflict
injury
on
the
former
by
wrongful
acts
which
would
be
cause
of
war
as
between
foreign
powers
and
only
fail
to
be
such
in
our
system
because
perpetrated
under
cover
of
the
union
is
it
possible
to
present
this
subject
as
truth
and
the
occasion
require
without
noticing
the
reiterated
but
groundless
allegation
that
the
south
has
persistently
asserted
claims
and
obtained
advantages
in
the
practical
administration
of
the
general
government
to
the
prejudice
of
the
north
and
in
which
the
latter
has
acquiesced
that
is
the
states
which
either
promote
or
tolerate
attacks
on
the
rights
of
persons
and
of
property
in
other
states
to
disguise
their
own
injustice
pretend
or
imagine
and
constantly
aver
that
they
whose
constitutional
rights
are
thus
systematically
assailed
are
themselves
the
aggressors
at
the
present
time
this
imputed
aggression
resting
as
it
does
only
in
the
vague
declamatory
charges
of
political
agitators
resolves
itself
into
misapprehension
or
misinterpretation
of
the
principles
and
facts
of
the
political
organization
of
the
new
territories
of
the
united
states
what
is
the
voice
of
history
when
the
ordinance
which
provided
for
the
government
of
the
territory
northwest
of
the
river
ohio
and
for
its
eventual
subdivision
into
new
states
was
adopted
in
the
congress
of
the
confederation
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
question
of
future
relative
power
as
between
the
states
which
retained
and
those
which
did
not
retain
a
numerous
colored
population
escaped
notice
or
failed
to
be
considered
and
yet
the
concession
of
that
vast
territory
to
the
interests
and
opinions
of
the
northern
states
a
territory
now
the
seat
of
five
among
the
largest
members
of
the
union
was
in
great
measure
the
act
of
the
state
of
virginia
and
of
the
south
when
louisiana
was
acquired
by
the
united
states
it
was
an
acquisition
not
less
to
the
north
than
to
the
south
for
while
it
was
important
to
the
country
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
mississippi
to
become
the
emporium
of
the
country
above
it
so
also
it
was
even
more
important
to
the
whole
union
to
have
that
emporium
and
although
the
new
province
by
reason
of
its
imperfect
settlement
was
mainly
regarded
as
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
yet
in
fact
it
extended
to
the
opposite
boundaries
of
the
united
states
with
far
greater
breadth
above
than
below
and
was
in
territory
as
in
everything
else
equally
at
least
an
accession
to
the
northern
states
it
is
mere
delusion
and
prejudice
therefore
to
speak
of
louisiana
as
acquisition
in
the
special
interest
of
the
south
the
patriotic
and
just
men
who
participated
in
the
act
were
influenced
by
motives
far
above
all
sectional
jealousies
it
was
in
truth
the
great
event
which
by
completing
for
us
the
possession
of
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
with
commercial
access
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
imparted
unity
and
strength
to
the
whole
confederation
and
attached
together
by
indissoluble
ties
the
east
and
the
west
as
well
as
the
north
and
the
south
as
to
florida
that
was
but
the
transfer
by
spain
to
the
united
states
of
territory
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
mississippi
in
exchange
for
large
territory
which
the
united
states
transferred
to
spain
on
the
west
side
of
that
river
as
the
entire
diplomatic
history
of
the
transaction
serves
to
demonstrate
moreover
it
was
an
acquisition
demanded
by
the
commercial
interests
and
the
security
of
the
whole
union
in
the
meantime
the
people
of
the
united
states
had
grown
up
to
a
proper
consciousness
of
their
strength
and
in
a
brief
contest
with
france
and
in
a
second
serious
war
with
great
britain
they
had
shaken
off
all
which
remained
of
undue
reverence
for
europe
and
emerged
from
the
atmosphere
of
those
transatlantic
influences
which
surrounded
the
infant
republic
and
had
begun
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
full
and
systematic
development
of
the
internal
resources
of
the
union
among
the
evanescent
controversies
of
that
period
the
most
conspicuous
was
the
question
of
regulation
by
congress
of
the
social
condition
of
the
future
states
to
be
rounded
in
the
territory
of
louisiana
the
ordinance
for
the
government
of
the
territory
northwest
of
the
river
ohio
had
contained
a
provision
which
prohibited
the
use
of
servile
labor
therein
subject
to
the
condition
of
the
extraditions
of
fugitives
from
service
due
in
any
other
part
of
the
united
states
subsequently
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
this
provision
ceased
to
remain
as
a
law
for
its
operation
as
such
was
absolutely
superseded
by
the
constitution
but
the
recollection
of
the
fact
excited
the
zeal
of
social
propagandism
in
some
sections
of
the
confederation
and
when
a
second
state
that
of
missouri
came
to
be
formed
in
the
territory
of
louisiana
proposition
was
made
to
extend
to
the
latter
territory
the
restriction
originally
applied
to
the
country
situated
between
the
rivers
ohio
and
mississippi
most
questionable
as
was
this
proposition
in
all
its
constitutional
relations
nevertheless
it
received
the
sanction
of
congress
with
some
slight
modifications
of
line
to
save
the
existing
rights
of
the
intended
new
state
it
was
reluctantly
acquiesced
in
by
southern
states
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
cause
of
peace
and
of
the
union
not
only
of
the
rights
stipulated
by
the
treaty
of
louisiana
but
of
the
principle
of
equality
among
the
states
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
it
was
received
by
the
northern
states
with
angry
and
resentful
condemnation
and
complaint
because
it
did
not
concede
all
which
they
had
exactingly
demanded
having
passed
through
the
forms
of
legislation
it
took
its
place
in
the
statute
book
standing
open
to
repeal
like
any
other
act
of
doubtful
constitutionality
subject
to
be
pronounced
null
and
void
by
the
courts
of
law
and
possessing
no
possible
efficacy
to
control
the
rights
of
the
states
which
might
thereafter
be
organized
out
of
any
part
of
the
original
territory
of
louisiana
in
all
this
if
any
aggression
there
were
any
innovation
upon
preexisting
rights
to
which
portion
of
the
union
are
they
justly
chargeable
this
controversy
passed
away
with
the
occasion
nothing
surviving
it
save
the
dormant
letter
of
the
statute
but
long
afterwards
when
by
the
proposed
accession
of
the
republic
of
texas
the
united
states
were
to
take
their
next
step
in
territorial
greatness
a
similar
contingency
occurred
and
became
the
occasion
for
systematized
attempts
to
intervene
in
the
domestic
affairs
of
one
section
of
the
union
in
defiance
of
their
rights
as
states
and
of
the
stipulations
of
the
constitution
these
attempts
assumed
a
practical
direction
in
the
shape
of
persevering
endeavors
by
some
of
the
representatives
in
both
houses
of
congress
to
deprive
the
southern
states
of
the
supposed
benefit
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
authorizing
the
organization
of
the
state
of
missouri
but
the
good
sense
of
the
people
and
the
vital
force
of
the
constitution
triumphed
over
sectional
prejudice
and
the
political
errors
of
the
day
and
the
state
of
texas
returned
to
the
union
as
she
was
with
social
institutions
which
her
people
had
chosen
for
themselves
and
with
express
agreement
by
the
reannexing
act
that
she
should
be
susceptible
of
subdivision
into
a
plurality
of
states
whatever
advantage
the
interests
of
the
southern
states
as
such
gained
by
this
were
far
inferior
in
results
as
they
unfolded
in
the
progress
of
time
to
those
which
sprang
from
previous
concessions
made
by
the
south
to
every
thoughtful
friend
of
the
union
to
the
true
lovers
of
their
country
to
all
who
longed
and
labored
for
the
full
success
of
this
great
experiment
of
republican
institutions
it
was
cause
of
gratulation
that
such
an
opportunity
had
occurred
to
illustrate
our
advancing
power
on
this
continent
and
to
furnish
to
the
world
additional
assurance
of
the
strength
and
stability
of
the
constitution
who
would
wish
to
see
florida
still
a
european
colony
who
would
rejoice
to
hail
texas
as
a
lone
star
instead
of
one
in
the
galaxy
of
states
who
does
not
appreciate
the
incalculable
benefits
of
the
acquisition
of
louisiana
and
yet
narrow
views
and
sectional
purposes
would
inevitably
have
excluded
them
all
from
the
union
but
another
struggle
on
the
same
point
ensued
when
our
victorious
armies
returned
from
mexico
and
it
devolved
on
congress
to
provide
for
the
territories
acquired
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
the
great
relations
of
the
subject
had
now
become
distinct
and
clear
to
the
perception
of
the
public
mind
which
appreciated
the
evils
of
sectional
controversy
upon
the
question
of
the
admission
of
new
states
in
that
crisis
intense
solicitude
pervaded
the
nation
but
the
patriotic
impulses
of
the
popular
heart
guided
by
the
admonitory
advice
of
the
father
of
his
country
rose
superior
to
all
the
difficulties
of
the
incorporation
of
a
new
empire
into
the
union
in
the
counsels
of
congress
there
was
manifested
extreme
antagonism
of
opinion
and
action
between
some
representatives
who
sought
by
the
abusive
and
unconstitutional
employment
of
the
legislative
powers
of
the
government
to
interfere
in
the
condition
of
the
inchoate
states
and
to
impose
their
own
social
theories
upon
the
latter
and
other
repr
esentatives
who
repelled
the
interposition
of
the
general
government
in
this
respect
and
maintained
the
selfconstituting
rights
of
the
states
in
truth
the
thing
attempted
was
in
form
alone
action
of
the
general
government
while
in
reality
it
was
the
endeavor
by
abuse
of
legislative
power
to
force
the
ideas
of
internal
policy
entertained
in
particular
states
upon
allied
independent
states
once
more
the
constitution
and
the
union
triumphed
signally
the
new
territories
were
organized
without
restrictions
on
the
disputed
point
and
were
thus
left
to
judge
in
that
particular
for
themselves
and
the
sense
of
constitutional
faith
proved
vigorous
enough
in
congress
not
only
to
accomplish
this
primary
object
but
also
the
incidental
and
hardly
less
important
one
of
so
amending
the
provisions
of
the
statute
for
the
extradition
of
fugitives
from
service
as
to
place
that
public
duty
under
the
safeguard
of
the
general
government
and
thus
relieve
it
from
obstacles
raised
up
by
the
legislation
of
some
of
the
states
vain
declamation
regarding
the
provisions
of
law
for
the
extradition
of
fugitives
from
service
with
occasional
episodes
of
frantic
effort
to
obstruct
their
execution
by
riot
and
murder
continued
for
a
brief
time
to
agitate
certain
localities
but
the
true
principle
of
leaving
each
state
and
territory
to
regulate
its
own
laws
of
labor
according
to
its
own
sense
of
right
and
expediency
had
acquired
fast
hold
of
the
public
judgment
to
such
a
degree
that
by
common
consent
it
was
observed
in
the
organization
of
the
territory
of
washington
when
more
recently
it
became
requisite
to
organize
the
territories
of
nebraska
and
kansas
it
was
the
natural
and
legitimate
if
not
the
inevitable
consequence
of
previous
events
and
legislation
that
the
same
great
and
sound
principle
which
had
already
been
applied
to
utah
and
new
mexico
should
be
applied
to
themthat
they
should
stand
exempt
from
the
restrictions
proposed
in
the
act
relative
to
the
state
of
missouri
these
restrictions
were
in
the
estimation
of
many
thoughtful
men
null
from
the
beginning
unauthorized
by
the
constitution
contrary
to
the
treaty
stipulations
for
the
cession
of
louisiana
and
inconsistent
with
the
equality
of
these
states
they
had
been
stripped
of
all
moral
authority
by
persistent
efforts
to
procure
their
indirect
repeal
through
contradictory
enactments
they
had
been
practically
abrogated
by
the
legislation
attending
the
organization
of
utah
new
mexico
and
washington
if
any
vitality
remained
in
them
it
would
have
been
taken
away
in
effect
by
the
new
territorial
acts
in
the
form
originally
proposed
to
the
senate
at
the
first
session
of
the
last
congress
it
was
manly
and
ingenuous
as
well
as
patriotic
and
just
to
do
this
directly
and
plainly
and
thus
relieve
the
statute
book
of
an
act
which
might
be
of
possible
future
injury
but
of
no
possible
future
benefit
and
the
measure
of
its
repeal
was
the
final
consummation
and
complete
recognition
of
the
principle
that
no
portion
of
the
united
states
shall
undertake
through
assumption
of
the
powers
of
the
general
government
to
dictate
the
social
institutions
of
any
other
portion
the
scope
and
effect
of
the
language
of
repeal
were
not
left
in
doubt
it
was
declared
in
terms
to
be
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
this
act
not
to
legislate
slavery
into
any
territory
or
state
nor
to
exclude
it
therefrom
but
to
leave
the
people
thereof
perfectly
free
to
form
and
regulate
their
domestic
institutions
in
their
own
way
subject
only
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
measure
could
not
be
withstood
upon
its
merits
alone
it
was
attacked
with
violence
on
the
false
or
delusive
pretext
that
it
constituted
a
breach
of
faith
never
was
objection
more
utterly
destitute
of
substantial
justification
when
before
was
it
imagined
by
sensible
men
that
a
regulative
or
declarative
statute
whether
enacted
ten
or
forty
years
ago
is
irrepealable
that
an
act
of
congress
is
above
the
constitution
if
indeed
there
were
in
the
facts
any
cause
to
impute
bad
faith
it
would
attach
to
those
only
who
have
never
ceased
from
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
restrictive
provision
to
the
present
day
to
denounce
and
condemn
it
who
have
constantly
refused
to
complete
it
by
needful
supplementary
legislation
who
have
spared
no
exertion
to
deprive
it
of
moral
force
who
have
themselves
again
and
again
attempted
its
repeal
by
the
enactment
of
incompatible
provisions
and
who
by
the
inevitable
reactionary
effect
of
their
own
violence
on
the
subject
awakened
the
country
to
perception
of
the
true
constitutional
principle
of
leaving
the
matter
involved
to
the
discretion
of
the
people
of
the
respective
existing
or
incipient
states
it
is
not
pretended
that
this
principle
or
any
other
precludes
the
possibility
of
evils
in
practice
disturbed
as
political
action
is
liable
to
be
by
human
passions
no
form
of
government
is
exempt
from
inconveniences
but
in
this
case
they
are
the
result
of
the
abuse
and
not
of
the
legitimate
exercise
of
the
powers
reserved
or
conferred
in
the
organization
of
a
territory
they
are
not
to
be
charged
to
the
great
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
on
the
contrary
they
disappear
before
the
intelligence
and
patriotism
of
the
people
exerting
through
the
ballot
box
their
peaceful
and
silent
but
irresistible
power
if
the
friends
of
the
constitution
are
to
have
another
struggle
its
enemies
could
not
present
a
more
acceptable
issue
than
that
of
a
state
whose
constitution
clearly
embraces
a
republican
form
of
government
being
excluded
from
the
union
because
its
domestic
institutions
may
not
in
all
respects
comport
with
the
ideas
of
what
is
wise
and
expedient
entertained
in
some
other
state
fresh
from
groundless
imputations
of
breach
of
faith
against
others
men
will
commence
the
agitation
of
this
new
question
with
indubitable
violation
of
an
express
compact
between
the
independent
sovereign
powers
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
republic
of
texas
as
well
as
of
the
older
and
equally
solemn
compacts
which
assure
the
equality
of
all
the
states
but
deplorable
as
would
be
such
a
violation
of
compact
in
itself
and
in
all
its
direct
consequences
that
is
the
very
least
of
the
evils
involved
when
sectional
agitators
shall
have
succeeded
in
forcing
on
this
issue
can
their
pretensions
fail
to
be
met
by
counter
pretensions
will
not
different
states
be
compelled
respectively
to
meet
extremes
with
extremes
and
if
either
extreme
carry
its
point
what
is
that
so
far
forth
but
dissolution
of
the
union
if
a
new
state
formed
from
the
territory
of
the
united
states
be
absolutely
excluded
from
admission
therein
that
fact
of
itself
constitutes
the
disruption
of
union
between
it
and
the
other
states
but
the
process
of
dissolution
could
not
stop
there
would
not
a
sectional
decision
producing
such
result
by
a
majority
of
votes
either
northern
or
southern
of
necessity
drive
out
the
oppressed
and
aggrieved
minority
and
place
in
presence
of
each
other
two
irreconcilably
hostile
confederations
it
is
necessary
to
speak
thus
plainly
of
projects
the
offspring
of
that
sectional
agitation
now
prevailing
in
some
of
the
states
which
are
as
impracticable
as
they
are
unconstitutional
and
which
if
persevered
in
must
and
will
end
calamitously
it
is
either
disunion
and
civil
war
or
it
is
mere
angry
idle
aimless
disturbance
of
public
peace
and
tranquillity
disunion
for
what
if
the
passionate
rage
of
fanaticism
and
partisan
spirit
did
not
force
the
fact
upon
our
attention
it
would
be
difficult
to
believe
that
any
considerable
portion
of
the
people
of
this
enlightened
country
could
have
so
surrendered
themselves
to
a
fanatical
devotion
to
the
supposed
interests
of
the
relatively
few
africans
in
the
united
states
as
totally
to
abandon
and
disregard
the
interests
of
the
americans
to
trample
under
foot
the
injunctions
of
moral
and
constitutional
obligation
and
to
engage
in
plans
of
vindictive
hostility
against
those
who
are
associated
with
them
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
common
heritage
of
our
national
institutions
nor
is
it
hostility
against
their
fellowcitizens
of
one
section
of
the
union
alone
the
interests
the
honor
the
duty
the
peace
and
the
prosperity
of
the
people
of
all
sections
are
equally
involved
and
imperiled
in
this
question
and
are
patriotic
men
in
any
part
of
the
union
prepared
on
such
issue
thus
madly
to
invite
all
the
consequences
of
the
forfeiture
of
their
constitutional
engagements
it
is
impossible
the
storm
of
frenzy
and
faction
must
inevitably
dash
itself
in
vain
against
the
unshaken
rock
of
the
constitution
i
shall
never
doubt
it
i
know
that
the
union
is
stronger
a
thousand
times
than
all
the
wild
and
chimerical
schemes
of
social
change
which
are
generated
one
after
another
in
the
unstable
minds
of
visionary
sophists
and
interested
agitators
i
rely
confidently
on
the
patriotism
of
the
people
on
the
dignity
and
selfrespect
of
the
states
on
the
wisdom
of
congress
and
above
all
on
the
continued
gracious
favor
of
almighty
god
to
maintain
against
all
enemies
whether
at
home
or
abroad
the
sanctity
of
the
constitution
and
the
integrity
of
the
union

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
past
has
been
an
eventful
year
and
will
be
hereafter
referred
to
as
a
marked
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
world
while
we
have
been
happily
preserved
from
the
calamities
of
war
our
domestic
prosperity
has
not
been
entirely
uninterrupted
the
crops
in
portions
of
the
country
have
been
nearly
cut
off
disease
has
prevailed
to
a
greater
extent
than
usual
and
the
sacrifice
of
human
life
through
casualties
by
sea
and
land
is
without
parallel
but
the
pestilence
has
swept
by
and
restored
salubrity
invites
the
absent
to
their
homes
and
the
return
of
business
to
its
ordinary
channels
if
the
earth
has
rewarded
the
labor
of
the
husbandman
less
bountifully
than
in
preceding
seasons
it
has
left
him
with
abundance
for
domestic
wants
and
a
large
surplus
for
exportation
in
the
present
therefore
as
in
the
past
we
find
ample
grounds
for
reverent
thankfulness
to
the
god
of
grace
and
providence
for
his
protecting
care
and
merciful
dealings
with
us
as
a
people
although
our
attention
has
been
arrested
by
painful
interest
in
passing
events
yet
our
country
feels
no
more
than
the
slight
vibrations
of
the
convulsions
which
have
shaken
europe
as
individuals
we
can
not
repress
sympathy
with
human
suffering
nor
regret
for
the
causes
which
produce
it
as
a
nation
we
are
reminded
that
whatever
interrupts
the
peace
or
checks
the
prosperity
of
any
part
of
christendom
tends
more
or
less
to
involve
our
own
the
condition
of
states
is
not
unlike
that
of
individuals
they
are
mutually
dependent
upon
each
other
amicable
relations
between
them
and
reciprocal
good
will
are
essential
for
the
promotion
of
whatever
is
desirable
in
their
moral
social
and
political
condition
hence
it
has
been
my
earnest
endeavor
to
maintain
peace
and
friendly
intercourse
with
all
nations
the
wise
theory
of
this
government
so
early
adopted
and
steadily
pursued
of
avoiding
all
entangling
alliances
has
hitherto
exempted
it
from
many
complications
in
which
it
would
otherwise
have
become
involved
notwithstanding
this
our
clearly
defined
and
wellsustained
course
of
action
and
our
geographical
position
so
remote
from
europe
increasing
disposition
has
been
manifested
by
some
of
its
governments
to
supervise
and
in
certain
respects
to
direct
our
foreign
policy
in
plans
for
adjusting
the
balance
of
power
among
themselves
they
have
assumed
to
take
us
into
account
and
would
constrain
us
to
conform
our
conduct
to
their
views
one
or
another
of
the
powers
of
europe
has
from
time
to
time
undertaken
to
enforce
arbitrary
regulations
contrary
in
many
respects
to
established
principles
of
international
law
that
law
the
united
states
have
in
their
foreign
intercourse
uniformly
respected
and
observed
and
they
can
not
recognize
any
such
interpolations
therein
as
the
temporary
interests
of
others
may
suggest
they
do
not
admit
that
the
sovereigns
of
one
continent
or
of
a
particular
community
of
states
can
legislate
for
all
others
leaving
the
transatlantic
nations
to
adjust
their
political
system
in
the
way
they
may
think
best
for
their
common
welfare
the
independent
powers
of
this
continent
may
well
assert
the
right
to
be
exempt
from
all
annoying
interference
on
their
part
systematic
abstinence
from
intimate
political
connection
with
distant
foreign
nations
does
not
conflict
with
giving
the
widest
range
to
our
foreign
commerce
this
distinction
so
clearly
marked
in
history
seems
to
have
been
overlooked
or
disregarded
by
some
leading
foreign
states
our
refusal
to
be
brought
within
and
subjected
to
their
peculiar
system
has
i
fear
created
a
jealous
distrust
of
our
conduct
and
induced
on
their
part
occasional
acts
of
disturbing
effect
upon
our
foreign
relations
our
present
attitude
and
past
course
give
assurances
which
should
not
be
questioned
that
our
purposes
are
not
aggressive
nor
threatening
to
the
safety
and
welfare
of
other
nations
our
military
establishment
in
time
of
peace
is
adapted
to
maintain
exterior
defenses
and
to
preserve
order
among
the
aboriginal
tribes
within
the
limits
of
the
union
our
naval
force
is
intended
only
for
the
protection
of
our
citizens
abroad
and
of
our
commerce
diffused
as
it
is
over
all
the
seas
of
the
globe
the
government
of
the
united
states
being
essentially
pacific
in
policy
stands
prepared
to
repel
invasion
by
the
voluntary
service
of
a
patriotic
people
and
provides
no
permanent
means
of
foreign
aggression
these
considerations
should
allay
all
apprehension
that
we
are
disposed
to
encroach
on
the
rights
or
endanger
the
security
of
other
states
some
european
powers
have
regarded
with
disquieting
concern
the
territorial
expansion
of
the
united
states
this
rapid
growth
has
resulted
from
the
legitimate
exercise
of
sovereign
rights
belonging
alike
to
all
nations
and
by
many
liberally
exercised
under
such
circumstances
it
could
hardly
have
been
expected
that
those
among
them
which
have
within
a
comparatively
recent
period
subdued
and
absorbed
ancient
kingdoms
planted
their
standards
on
every
continent
and
now
possess
or
claim
the
control
of
the
islands
of
every
ocean
as
their
appropriate
domain
would
look
with
unfriendly
sentiments
upon
the
acquisitions
of
this
country
in
every
instance
honorably
obtained
or
would
feel
themselves
justified
in
imputing
our
advancement
to
a
spirit
of
aggression
or
to
a
passion
for
political
predominance
our
foreign
commerce
has
reached
a
magnitude
and
extent
nearly
equal
to
that
of
the
first
maritime
power
of
the
earth
and
exceeding
that
of
any
other
over
this
great
interest
in
which
not
only
our
merchants
but
all
classes
of
citizens
at
least
indirectly
are
concerned
it
is
the
duty
of
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
the
government
to
exercise
a
careful
supervision
and
adopt
proper
measures
for
its
protection
the
policy
which
i
had
in
view
in
regard
to
this
interest
embraces
its
future
as
well
as
its
present
security
long
experience
has
shown
that
in
general
when
the
principal
powers
of
europe
are
engaged
in
war
the
rights
of
neutral
nations
are
endangered
this
consideration
led
in
the
progress
of
the
war
of
our
independence
to
the
formation
of
the
celebrated
confederacy
of
armed
neutrality
a
primary
object
of
which
was
to
assert
the
doctrine
that
free
ships
make
free
goods
except
in
the
case
of
articles
contraband
of
wara
doctrine
which
from
the
very
commencement
of
our
national
being
has
been
a
cherished
idea
of
the
statesmen
of
this
country
at
one
period
or
another
every
maritime
power
has
by
some
solemn
treaty
stipulation
recognized
that
principle
and
it
might
have
been
hoped
that
it
would
come
to
be
universally
received
and
respected
as
a
rule
of
international
law
but
the
refusal
of
one
power
prevented
this
and
in
the
next
great
war
which
ensuedthat
of
the
french
revolutionit
failed
to
be
respected
among
the
belligerent
states
of
europe
notwithstanding
this
the
principle
is
generally
admitted
to
be
a
sound
and
salutary
one
so
much
so
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
existing
war
in
europe
great
britain
and
france
announced
their
purpose
to
observe
it
for
the
present
not
however
as
a
recognized
international
fight
but
as
a
mere
concession
for
the
time
being
the
cooperation
however
of
these
two
powerful
maritime
nations
in
the
interest
of
neutral
rights
appeared
to
me
to
afford
an
occasion
inviting
and
justifying
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
a
renewed
effort
to
make
the
doctrine
in
question
a
principle
of
international
law
by
means
of
special
conventions
between
the
several
powers
of
europe
and
america
accordingly
a
proposition
embracing
not
only
the
rule
that
free
ships
make
free
goods
except
contraband
articles
but
also
the
less
contested
one
that
neutral
property
other
than
contraband
though
on
board
enemys
ships
shall
be
exempt
from
confiscation
has
been
submitted
by
this
government
to
those
of
europe
and
america
russia
acted
promptly
in
this
matter
and
a
convention
was
concluded
between
that
country
and
the
united
states
providing
for
the
observance
of
the
principles
announced
not
only
as
between
themselves
but
also
as
between
them
and
all
other
nations
which
shall
enter
into
like
stipulations
none
of
the
other
powers
have
as
yet
taken
final
action
on
the
subject
i
am
not
aware
however
that
any
objection
to
the
proposed
stipulations
has
been
made
but
on
the
contrary
they
are
acknowledged
to
be
essential
to
the
security
of
neutral
commerce
and
the
only
apparent
obstacle
to
their
general
adoption
is
in
the
possibility
that
it
may
be
encumbered
by
inadmissible
conditions
the
king
of
the
two
sicilies
has
expressed
to
our
minister
at
naples
his
readiness
to
concur
in
our
proposition
relative
to
neutral
rights
and
to
enter
into
a
convention
on
that
subject
the
king
of
prussia
entirely
approves
of
the
project
of
a
treaty
to
the
same
effect
submitted
to
him
but
proposes
an
additional
article
providing
for
the
renunciation
of
privateering
such
an
article
for
most
obvious
reasons
is
much
desired
by
nations
having
naval
establishments
large
in
proportion
to
their
foreign
commerce
if
it
were
adopted
as
an
international
rule
the
commerce
of
a
nation
having
comparatively
a
small
naval
force
would
be
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
its
enemy
in
case
of
war
with
a
power
of
decided
naval
superiority
the
bare
statement
of
the
condition
in
which
the
united
states
would
be
placed
after
having
surrendered
the
right
to
resort
to
privateers
in
the
event
of
war
with
a
belligerent
of
naval
supremacy
will
show
that
this
government
could
never
listen
to
such
a
proposition
the
navy
of
the
first
maritime
power
in
europe
is
at
least
ten
times
as
large
as
that
of
the
united
states
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
two
countries
is
nearly
equal
and
about
equally
exposed
to
hostile
depredations
in
war
between
that
power
and
the
united
states
without
resort
on
our
part
to
our
mercantile
marine
the
means
of
our
enemy
to
inflict
injury
upon
our
commerce
would
be
tenfold
greater
than
ours
to
retaliate
we
could
not
extricate
our
country
from
this
unequal
condition
with
such
an
enemy
unless
we
at
once
dep
arted
from
our
present
peaceful
policy
and
became
a
great
naval
power
nor
would
this
country
be
better
situated
in
war
with
one
of
the
secondary
naval
powers
though
the
naval
disparity
would
be
less
the
greater
extent
and
more
exposed
condition
of
our
widespread
commerce
would
give
any
of
them
a
like
advantage
over
us
the
proposition
to
enter
into
engagements
to
forego
a
resort
to
privateers
in
case
this
country
should
be
forced
into
war
with
a
great
naval
power
is
not
entitled
to
more
favorable
consideration
than
would
be
a
proposition
to
agree
not
to
accept
the
services
of
volunteers
for
operations
on
land
when
the
honor
or
the
rights
of
our
country
require
it
to
assume
a
hostile
attitude
it
confidently
relies
upon
the
patriotism
of
its
citizens
not
ordinarily
devoted
to
the
military
profession
to
augment
the
army
and
the
navy
so
as
to
make
them
fully
adequate
to
the
emergency
which
calls
them
into
action
the
proposal
to
surrender
the
right
to
employ
privateers
is
professedly
founded
upon
the
principle
that
private
property
of
unoffending
noncombatants
though
enemies
should
be
exempt
from
the
ravages
of
war
but
the
proposed
surrender
goes
but
little
way
in
carrying
out
that
principle
which
equally
requires
that
such
private
property
should
not
be
seized
or
molested
by
national
ships
of
war
should
the
leading
powers
of
europe
concur
in
proposing
as
a
rule
of
international
law
to
exempt
private
property
upon
the
ocean
from
seizure
by
public
armed
cruisers
as
well
as
by
privateers
the
united
states
will
readily
meet
them
upon
that
broad
ground
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
relative
to
coast
fisheries
and
to
reciprocal
trade
with
the
british
north
american
provinces
have
been
exchanged
and
some
of
its
anticipated
advantages
are
already
enjoyed
by
us
although
its
full
execution
was
to
abide
certain
acts
of
legislation
not
yet
fully
performed
so
soon
as
it
was
ratified
great
britain
opened
to
our
commerce
the
free
navigation
of
the
river
st
lawrence
and
to
our
fishermen
unmolested
access
to
the
shores
and
bays
from
which
they
had
been
previously
excluded
on
the
coasts
of
her
north
american
provinces
in
return
for
which
she
asked
for
the
introduction
free
of
duty
into
the
ports
of
the
united
states
of
the
fish
caught
on
the
same
coast
by
british
fishermen
this
being
the
compensation
stipulated
in
the
treaty
for
privileges
of
the
highest
importance
and
value
to
the
united
states
which
were
thus
voluntarily
yielded
before
it
became
effective
the
request
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
reasonable
one
but
it
could
not
be
acceded
to
from
want
of
authority
to
suspend
our
laws
imposing
duties
upon
all
foreign
fish
in
the
meantime
the
treasury
department
issued
a
regulation
for
ascertaining
the
duties
paid
or
secured
by
bonds
on
fish
caught
on
the
coasts
of
the
british
provinces
and
brought
to
our
markets
by
british
subjects
after
the
fishing
grounds
had
been
made
fully
accessible
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
a
proposition
which
will
be
submitted
to
you
for
authority
to
refund
the
duties
and
cancel
the
bonds
thus
received
the
provinces
of
canada
and
new
brunswick
have
also
anticipated
the
full
operation
of
the
treaty
by
legislative
arrangements
respectively
to
admit
free
of
duty
the
products
of
the
united
states
mentioned
in
the
free
list
of
the
treaty
and
an
arrangement
similar
to
that
regarding
british
fish
has
been
made
for
duties
now
chargeable
on
the
products
of
those
provinces
enumerated
in
the
same
free
list
and
introduced
therefrom
into
the
united
states
a
proposition
for
refunding
which
will
in
my
judgment
be
in
like
manner
entitled
to
your
favorable
consideration
there
is
difference
of
opinion
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
as
to
the
boundary
line
of
the
territory
of
washington
adjoining
the
british
possessions
on
the
pacific
which
has
already
led
to
difficulties
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
and
local
authorities
of
the
two
governments
i
recommend
that
provision
he
made
for
a
commission
to
be
joined
by
one
on
the
part
of
her
britannic
majesty
for
the
purpose
of
running
and
establishing
the
line
in
controversy
certain
stipulations
of
the
third
and
fourth
articles
of
the
treaty
concluded
by
the
united
states
and
great
britain
in
regarding
possessory
rights
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
and
property
of
the
pugets
sound
agricultural
company
have
given
rise
to
serious
disputes
and
it
is
important
to
all
concerned
that
summary
means
of
settling
them
amicably
should
be
devised
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
an
arrangement
can
be
made
on
just
terms
for
the
extinguishment
of
the
rights
in
question
embracing
also
the
right
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
to
the
navigation
of
the
river
columbia
and
i
therefore
suggest
to
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
making
a
contingent
appropriation
for
that
purpose
france
was
the
early
and
efficient
ally
of
the
united
states
in
their
struggle
for
independence
from
that
time
to
the
present
with
occasional
slight
interruptions
cordial
relations
of
friendship
have
existed
between
the
governments
and
people
of
the
two
countries
the
kindly
sentiments
cherished
alike
by
both
nations
have
led
to
extensive
social
and
commercial
intercourse
which
i
trust
will
not
be
interrupted
or
checked
by
any
casual
event
of
an
apparently
unsatisfactory
character
the
french
consul
at
san
francisco
was
not
long
since
brought
into
the
united
states
district
court
at
that
place
by
compulsory
process
as
a
witness
in
favor
of
another
foreign
consul
in
violation
as
the
french
government
conceives
of
his
privileges
under
our
consular
convention
with
france
there
being
nothing
in
the
transaction
which
could
imply
any
disrespect
to
france
or
its
consul
such
explanation
has
been
made
as
i
hope
will
be
satisfactory
subsequently
misunderstanding
arose
on
the
subject
of
the
french
government
having
as
it
appeared
abruptly
excluded
the
american
minister
to
spain
from
passing
through
france
on
his
way
from
london
to
madrid
but
that
government
has
unequivocally
disavowed
any
design
to
deny
the
right
of
transit
to
the
minister
of
the
united
states
and
after
explanations
to
this
effect
he
has
resumed
his
journey
and
actually
returned
through
france
to
spain
i
herewith
lay
before
congress
the
correspondence
on
this
subject
between
our
envoy
at
paris
and
the
minister
of
foreign
relations
of
the
french
government
the
position
of
our
affairs
with
spain
remains
as
at
the
close
of
the
last
session
internal
agitation
assuming
very
nearly
the
character
of
political
revolution
has
recently
convulsed
that
country
the
late
ministers
were
violently
expelled
from
power
and
men
of
very
different
views
in
relation
to
its
internal
affairs
have
succeeded
since
this
change
there
has
been
no
propitious
opportunity
to
resume
and
press
on
negotiations
for
the
adjustment
of
serious
questions
of
difficulty
between
the
spanish
government
and
the
united
states
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
our
minister
will
find
the
present
government
more
favorably
inclined
than
the
preceding
to
comply
with
our
just
demands
and
to
make
suitable
arrangements
for
restoring
harmony
and
preserving
peace
between
the
two
countries
negotiations
are
pending
with
denmark
to
discontinue
the
practice
of
levying
tolls
on
our
vessels
and
their
cargoes
passing
through
the
sound
i
do
not
doubt
that
we
can
claim
exemption
therefrom
as
a
matter
of
right
it
is
admitted
on
all
hands
that
this
exaction
is
sanctioned
not
by
the
general
principles
of
the
law
of
nations
but
only
by
special
conventions
which
most
of
the
commercial
nations
have
entered
into
with
denmark
the
fifth
article
of
our
treaty
of
with
denmark
provides
that
there
shall
not
be
paid
on
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
and
their
cargoes
when
passing
through
the
sound
higher
duties
than
those
of
the
most
favored
nations
this
may
be
regarded
as
an
implied
agreement
to
submit
to
the
tolls
during
the
continuance
of
the
treaty
and
consequently
may
embarrass
the
assertion
of
our
right
to
be
released
therefrom
there
are
also
other
provisions
in
the
treaty
which
ought
to
be
modified
it
was
to
remain
in
force
for
ten
years
and
until
one
year
after
either
party
should
give
notice
to
the
other
of
intention
to
terminate
it
i
deem
it
expedient
that
the
contemplated
notice
should
be
given
to
the
government
of
denmark
the
naval
expedition
dispatched
about
two
years
since
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
relations
with
the
empire
of
japan
has
been
ably
and
skillfully
conducted
to
a
successful
termination
by
the
officer
to
whom
it
was
intrusted
a
treaty
opening
certain
of
the
ports
of
that
populous
country
has
been
negotiated
and
in
order
to
give
full
effect
thereto
it
only
remains
to
exchange
ratifications
and
adopt
requisite
commercial
regulations
the
treaty
lately
concluded
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
settled
some
of
our
most
embarrassing
difficulties
with
that
country
but
numerous
claims
upon
it
for
wrongs
and
injuries
to
our
citizens
remained
unadjusted
and
many
new
cases
have
been
recently
added
to
the
former
list
of
grievances
our
legation
has
been
earnest
in
its
endeavors
to
obtain
from
the
mexican
government
a
favorable
consideration
of
these
claims
but
hitherto
without
success
this
failure
is
probably
in
some
measure
to
be
ascribed
to
the
disturbed
condition
of
that
country
it
has
been
my
anxious
desire
to
maintain
friendly
relations
with
the
mexican
republic
and
to
cause
its
rights
and
territories
to
be
respected
not
only
by
our
citizens
but
by
foreigners
who
have
resorted
to
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
organizing
hostile
expeditions
against
some
of
the
states
of
that
republic
the
defenseless
condition
in
which
its
frontiers
have
been
left
has
stimulated
lawless
adventurers
to
embark
in
these
enterprises
and
greatly
increased
the
difficulty
of
enforcing
our
obligations
of
neutrality
regarding
it
as
my
solemn
duty
to
fulfill
efficiently
these
obligations
not
only
toward
mexico
but

other
foreign
nations
i
have
exerted
all
the
powers
with
which
i
am
invested
to
defeat
such
proceedings
and
bring
to
punishment
those
who
by
taking
a
part
therein
violated
our
laws
the
energy
and
activity
of
our
civil
and
military
authorities
have
frustrated
the
designs
of
those
who
meditated
expeditions
of
this
character
except
in
two
instances
one
of
these
composed
of
foreigners
was
at
first
countenanced
and
aided
by
the
mexican
government
itself
it
having
been
deceived
as
to
their
real
object
the
other
small
in
number
eluded
the
vigilance
of
the
magistrates
at
san
francisco
and
succeeded
in
reaching
the
mexican
territories
but
the
effective
measures
taken
by
this
government
compelled
the
abandonment
of
the
undertaking
the
commission
to
establish
the
new
line
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
the
th
of
december
last
has
been
organized
and
the
work
is
already
commenced
our
treaties
with
the
argentine
confederation
and
with
the
republics
of
uruguay
and
paraguay
secure
to
us
the
free
navigation
of
the
river
la
plata
and
some
of
its
larger
tributaries
but
the
same
success
has
not
attended
our
endeavors
to
open
the
amazon
the
reasons
in
favor
of
the
free
use
of
that
river
i
had
occasion
to
present
fully
in
a
former
message
and
considering
the
cordial
relations
which
have
long
existed
between
this
government
and
brazil
it
may
be
expected
that
pending
negotiations
will
eventually
reach
a
favorable
result
convenient
means
of
transit
between
the
several
parts
of
a
country
are
not
only
desirable
for
the
objects
of
commercial
and
personal
communication
but
essential
to
its
existence
under
one
government
separated
as
are
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
of
the
united
states
by
the
whole
breadth
of
the
continent
still
the
inhabitants
of
each
are
closely
bound
together
by
community
of
origin
and
institutions
and
by
strong
attachment
to
the
union
hence
the
constant
and
increasing
intercourse
and
vast
interchange
of
commercial
productions
between
these
remote
divisions
of
the
republic
at
the
present
time
the
most
practicable
and
only
commodious
routes
for
communication
between
them
are
by
the
way
of
the
isthmus
of
central
america
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
to
secure
these
avenues
against
all
danger
of
interruption
in
relation
to
central
america
perplexing
questions
existed
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
at
the
time
of
the
cession
of
california
these
as
well
as
questions
which
subsequently
arose
concerning
interoceanic
communication
across
the
isthmus
were
as
it
was
supposed
adjusted
by
the
treaty
of
april
but
unfortunately
they
have
been
reopened
by
serious
misunderstanding
as
to
the
import
of
some
or
its
provisions
a
readjustment
of
which
is
now
under
consideration
our
minister
at
london
has
made
strenuous
efforts
to
accomplish
this
desirable
object
but
has
not
yet
found
it
possible
to
bring
the
negotiations
to
a
termination
as
incidental
to
these
questions
i
deem
it
proper
to
notice
an
occurrence
which
happened
in
central
america
near
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
congress
so
soon
as
the
necessity
was
perceived
of
establishing
interoceanic
communications
across
the
isthmus
a
company
was
organized
under
the
authority
of
the
state
of
nicaragua
but
composed
for
the
most
part
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
opening
such
a
transit
way
by
the
river
san
juan
and
lake
nicaragua
which
soon
became
an
eligible
and
much
used
route
in
the
transportation
of
our
citizens
and
their
property
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
meanwhile
and
in
anticipation
of
the
completion
and
importance
of
this
transit
way
a
number
of
adventurers
had
taken
possession
of
the
old
spanish
port
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
san
juan
in
open
defiance
of
the
state
or
states
of
central
america
which
upon
their
becoming
independent
had
rightfully
succeeded
to
the
local
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
of
spain
these
adventurers
undertook
to
change
the
name
of
the
place
from
san
juan
del
norte
to
greytown
and
though
at
first
pretending
to
act
as
the
subjects
of
the
fictitious
sovereign
of
the
mosquito
indians
they
subsequently
repudiated
the
control
of
any
power
whatever
assumed
to
adopt
a
distinct
political
organization
and
declared
themselves
an
independent
sovereign
state
if
at
some
time
a
faint
hope
was
entertained
that
they
might
become
a
stable
and
respectable
community
that
hope
soon
vanished
they
proceeded
to
assert
unfounded
claims
to
civil
jurisdiction
over
punta
arenas
a
position
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
san
juan
which
was
in
possession
under
a
title
wholly
independent
of
them
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
interested
in
the
nicaragua
transit
company
and
which
was
indispensably
necessary
to
the
prosperous
operation
of
that
route
across
the
isthmus
the
company
resisted
their
groundless
claims
whereupon
they
proceeded
to
destroy
some
of
its
buildings
and
attempted
violently
to
dispossess
it
at
a
later
period
they
organized
a
strong
force
for
the
purpose
of
demolishing
the
establishment
at
punta
arenas
but
this
mischievous
design
was
defeated
by
the
interposition
of
one
of
our
ships
of
war
at
that
time
in
the
harbor
of
san
juan
subsequently
to
this
in
may
last
a
body
of
men
from
greytown
crossed
over
to
punta
arenas
arrogating
authority
to
arrest
on
the
charge
of
murder
a
captain
of
one
of
the
steamboats
of
the
transit
company
being
well
aware
that
the
claim
to
exercise
jurisdiction
there
would
be
resisted
then
as
it
had
been
on
previous
occasions
they
went
prepared
to
assert
it
by
force
of
arms
our
minister
to
central
america
happened
to
be
present
on
that
occasion
believing
that
the
captain
of
the
steamboat
was
innocent
for
he
witnessed
the
transaction
on
which
the
charge
was
founder
and
believing
also
that
the
intruding
party
having
no
jurisdiction
over
the
place
where
they
proposed
to
make
the
arrest
would
encounter
desperate
resistance
if
they
persisted
in
their
purpose
he
interposed
effectually
to
prevent
violence
and
bloodshed
the
american
minister
afterwards
visited
greytown
and
whilst
he
was
there
a
mob
including
certain
of
the
socalled
public
functionaries
of
the
place
surrounded
the
house
in
which
he
was
avowing
that
they
had
come
to
arrest
him
by
order
of
some
person
exercising
the
chief
authority
while
parleying
with
them
he
was
wounded
by
a
missile
from
the
crowd
a
boat
dispatched
from
the
american
steamer
northern
light
to
release
him
from
the
perilous
situation
in
which
he
was
understood
to
be
was
fired
into
by
the
town
guard
and
compelled
to
return
these
incidents
together
with
the
known
character
of
the
population
of
greytown
and
their
excited
state
induced
just
apprehensions
that
the
lives
and
property
of
our
citizens
at
punta
arenas
would
be
in
imminent
danger
after
the
departure
of
the
steamer
with
her
passengers
for
new
york
unless
a
guard
was
left
for
their
protection
for
this
purpose
and
in
order
to
insure
the
safety
of
passengers
and
property
passing
over
the
route
a
temporary
force
was
organized
at
considerable
expense
to
the
united
states
for
which
provision
was
made
at
the
last
session
of
congress
this
pretended
community
a
heterogeneous
assemblage
gathered
from
various
countries
and
composed
for
the
most
part
of
blacks
and
persons
of
mixed
blood
had
previously
given
other
indications
of
mischievous
and
dangerous
propensities
early
in
the
same
month
property
was
clandestinely
abstracted
from
the
depot
of
the
transit
company
and
taken
to
greytown
the
plunderers
obtained
shelter
there
and
their
pursuers
were
driven
back
by
its
people
who
not
only
protected
the
wrongdoers
and
shared
the
plunder
but
treated
with
rudeness
and
violence
those
who
sought
to
recover
their
property
such
in
substance
are
the
facts
submitted
to
my
consideration
and
proved
by
trustworthy
evidence
i
could
not
doubt
that
the
case
demanded
the
interposition
of
this
government
justice
required
that
reparation
should
be
made
for
so
many
and
such
gross
wrongs
and
that
a
course
of
insolence
and
plunder
tending
directly
to
the
insecurity
of
the
lives
of
numerous
travelers
and
of
the
rich
treasure
belonging
to
our
citizens
passing
over
this
transit
way
should
be
peremptorily
arrested
whatever
it
might
be
in
other
respects
the
community
in
question
in
power
to
do
mischief
was
not
despicable
it
was
well
provided
with
ordnance
small
arms
and
ammunition
and
might
easily
seize
on
the
unarmed
boats
freighted
with
millions
of
property
which
passed
almost
daily
within
its
reach
it
did
not
profess
to
belong
to
any
regular
government
and
had
in
fact
no
recognized
dependence
on
or
connection
with
anyone
to
which
the
united
states
or
their
injured
citizens
might
apply
for
redress
or
which
could
be
held
responsible
in
any
way
for
the
outrages
committed
not
standing
before
the
world
in
the
attitude
of
an
organized
political
society
being
neither
competent
to
exercise
the
rights
nor
to
discharge
the
obligations
of
a
government
it
was
in
fact
a
marauding
establishment
too
dangerous
to
be
disregarded
and
too
guilty
to
pass
unpunished
and
yet
incapable
of
being
treated
in
any
other
way
than
as
a
piratical
resort
of
outlaws
or
a
camp
of
savages
depredating
on
emigrant
trains
or
caravans
and
the
frontier
settlements
of
civilized
states
seasonable
notice
was
given
to
the
people
of
greytown
that
this
government
required
them
to
repair
the
injuries
they
had
done
to
our
citizens
and
to
make
suitable
apology
for
their
insult
of
our
minister
and
that
a
ship
of
war
would
be
dispatched
thither
to
enforce
compliance
with
these
demands
but
the
notice
passed
unheeded
thereupon
a
commander
of
the
navy
in
charge
of
the
sloop
of
war
cyane
was
ordered
to
repeat
the
demands
and
to
insist
upon
a
compliance
therewith
finding
that
neither
the
populace
nor
those
assuming
to
have
authority
over
them
manifested
any
disposition
to
make
the
required
reparation
or
even
to
offer
excuse
for
their
conduct
he
warned
them
by
a
public
proclamation
that
if
they
did
not
give
satisfaction
within
a
time
specified
he
would
bombar
d
the
town
by
this
procedure
he
afforded
them
opportunity
to
provide
for
their
personal
safety
to
those
also
who
desired
to
avoid
loss
of
property
in
the
punishment
about
to
be
inflicted
on
the
offending
town
he
furnished
the
means
of
removing
their
effects
by
the
boats
of
his
own
ship
and
of
a
steamer
which
he
procured
and
tendered
to
them
for
that
purpose
at
length
perceiving
no
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
town
to
comply
with
his
requisitions
he
appealed
to
the
commander
of
her
britannic
majestys
schooner
bermuda
who
was
seen
to
have
intercourse
and
apparently
much
influence
with
the
leaders
among
them
to
interpose
and
persuade
them
to
take
some
course
calculated
to
save
the
necessity
of
resorting
to
the
extreme
measure
indicated
in
his
proclamation
but
that
officer
instead
of
acceding
to
the
request
did
nothing
more
than
to
protest
against
the
contemplated
bombardment
no
steps
of
any
sort
were
taken
by
the
people
to
give
the
satisfaction
required
no
individuals
if
any
there
were
who
regarded
themselves
as
not
responsible
for
the
misconduct
of
the
community
adopted
any
means
to
separate
themselves
from
the
fate
of
the
guilty
the
several
charges
on
which
the
demands
for
redress
were
founded
had
been
publicly
known
to
all
for
some
time
and
were
again
announced
to
them
they
did
not
deny
any
of
these
charges
they
offered
no
explanation
nothing
in
extenuation
of
their
conduct
but
contumaciously
refused
to
hold
any
intercourse
with
the
commander
of
the
cyane
by
their
obstinate
silence
they
seemed
rather
desirous
to
provoke
chastisement
than
to
escape
it
there
is
ample
reason
to
believe
that
this
conduct
of
wanton
defiance
on
their
part
is
imputable
chiefly
to
the
delusive
idea
that
the
american
government
would
be
deterred
from
punishing
them
through
fear
of
displeasing
a
formidable
foreign
power
which
they
presumed
to
think
looked
with
complacency
upon
their
aggressive
and
insulting
deportment
toward
the
united
states
the
cyane
at
length
fired
upon
the
town
before
much
injury
had
been
done
the
fire
was
twice
suspended
in
order
to
afford
opportunity
for
an
arrangement
but
this
was
declined
most
of
the
buildings
of
the
place
of
little
value
generally
were
in
the
sequel
destroyed
but
owing
to
the
considerate
precautions
taken
by
our
naval
commander
there
was
no
destruction
of
life
when
the
cyane
was
ordered
to
central
america
it
was
confidently
hoped
and
expected
that
no
occasion
would
arise
for
a
resort
to
violence
and
destruction
of
property
and
loss
of
life
instructions
to
that
effect
were
given
to
her
commander
and
no
extreme
act
would
have
been
requisite
had
not
the
people
themselves
by
their
extraordinary
conduct
in
the
affair
frustrated
all
the
possible
mild
measures
for
obtaining
satisfaction
a
withdrawal
from
the
place
the
object
of
his
visit
entirely
defeated
would
under
the
circumstances
in
which
the
commander
of
the
cyane
found
himself
have
been
absolute
abandonment
of
all
claim
of
our
citizens
for
indemnification
and
submissive
acquiescence
in
national
indignity
it
would
have
encouraged
in
these
lawless
men
a
spirit
of
insolence
and
rapine
most
dangerous
to
the
lives
and
property
of
our
citizens
at
punta
arenas
and
probably
emboldened
them
to
grasp
at
the
treasures
and
valuable
merchandise
continually
passing
over
the
nicaragua
route
it
certainly
would
have
been
most
satisfactory
to
me
if
the
objects
of
the
cyanes
mission
could
have
been
consummated
without
any
act
of
public
force
but
the
arrogant
contumacy
of
the
offenders
rendered
it
impossible
to
avoid
the
alternative
either
to
break
up
their
establishment
or
to
leave
them
impressed
with
the
idea
that
they
might
persevere
with
impunity
in
a
career
of
insolence
and
plunder
this
transaction
has
been
the
subject
of
complaint
on
the
part
of
some
foreign
powers
and
has
been
characterized
with
more
of
harshness
than
of
justice
if
comparisons
were
to
be
instituted
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
present
repeated
instances
in
the
history
of
states
standing
in
the
very
front
of
modern
civilization
where
communities
far
less
offending
and
more
defenseless
than
greytown
have
been
chastised
with
much
greater
severity
and
where
not
cities
only
have
been
laid
in
ruins
but
human
life
has
been
recklessly
sacrificed
and
the
blood
of
the
innocent
made
profusely
to
mingle
with
that
of
the
guilty
passing
from
foreign
to
domestic
affairs
your
attention
is
naturally
directed
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
country
always
a
subject
of
general
interest
for
complete
and
exact
information
regarding
the
finances
and
the
various
branches
of
the
public
service
connected
therewith
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
from
which
it
will
appear
that
the
amount
of
revenue
during
the
last
fiscal
year
from
all
sources
was
and
that
the
public
expenditures
for
the
same
period
exclusive
of
payments
on
account
of
the
public
debt
amounted
to
during
the
same
period
the
payments
made
in
redemption
of
the
public
debt
including
interest
and
premium
amounted
to
to
the
sum
total
of
the
receipts
of
that
year
is
to
be
added
a
balance
remaining
in
the
treasury
at
the
commencement
thereof
amounting
to
and
at
the
close
of
the
same
year
a
corresponding
balance
amounting
to
of
receipts
above
expenditures
also
remained
in
the
treasury
although
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
receipts
of
the
current
fiscal
year
are
not
likely
to
equal
in
amount
those
of
the
last
yet
they
will
undoubtedly
exceed
the
amount
of
expenditures
by
at
least
i
shall
therefore
continue
to
direct
that
the
surplus
revenue
be
applied
so
far
as
it
can
be
judiciously
and
economically
done
to
the
reduction
of
the
public
debt
the
amount
of
which
at
the
commencement
of
the
last
fiscal
year
was
of
which
there
had
been
paid
on
the
th
day
of
november
the
sum
of
leaving
a
balance
of
outstanding
public
debt
of
only
redeemable
at
different
periods
within
fourteen
years
there
are
also
remnants
of
other
government
stocks
most
of
which
are
already
due
and
on
which
the
interest
has
ceased
but
which
have
not
yet
been
presented
for
payment
amounting
to
this
statement
exhibits
the
fact
that
the
annual
income
of
the
government
greatly
exceeds
the
amount
of
its
public
debt
which
latter
remains
unpaid
only
because
the
time
of
payment
has
not
yet
matured
and
it
can
not
be
discharged
at
once
except
at
the
option
of
public
creditors
who
prefer
to
retain
the
securities
of
the
united
states
and
the
other
fact
not
less
striking
that
the
annual
revenue
from
all
sources
exceeds
by
many
millions
of
dollars
the
amount
needed
for
a
prudent
and
economical
administration
of
the
government
the
estimates
presented
to
congress
from
the
different
executive
departments
at
the
last
session
amounted
to
and
the
appropriations
made
to
the
sum
of
of
this
excess
of
appropriations
over
estimates
however
more
than
twenty
millions
was
applicable
to
extraordinary
objects
having
no
reference
to
the
usual
annual
expenditures
among
these
objects
was
embraced
ten
millions
to
meet
the
third
article
of
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
so
that
in
fact
for
objects
of
ordinary
expenditure
the
appropriations
were
limited
to
considerably
less
than
i
therefore
renew
my
recommendation
for
a
reduction
of
the
duties
on
imports
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
presents
a
series
of
tables
showing
the
operation
of
the
revenue
system
for
several
successive
years
and
as
the
general
principle
of
reduction
of
duties
with
a
view
to
revenue
and
not
protection
may
now
be
regarded
as
the
settled
policy
of
the
country
i
trust
that
little
difficulty
will
be
encountered
in
settling
the
details
of
a
measure
to
that
effect
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
recommend
a
change
in
the
laws
which
recent
experience
has
shown
to
be
essential
to
the
protection
of
the
government
there
is
no
express
provision
of
law
requiring
the
records
and
papers
of
a
public
character
of
the
several
officers
of
the
government
to
be
left
in
their
offices
for
the
use
of
their
successors
nor
any
provision
declaring
it
felony
on
their
part
to
make
false
entries
in
the
books
or
return
false
accounts
in
the
absence
of
such
express
provision
by
law
the
outgoing
officers
in
many
instances
have
claimed
and
exercised
the
right
to
take
into
their
own
possession
important
books
and
papers
on
the
ground
that
these
were
their
private
property
and
have
placed
them
beyond
the
reach
of
the
government
conduct
of
this
character
brought
in
several
instances
to
the
notice
of
the
present
secretary
of
the
treasury
naturally
awakened
his
suspicion
and
resulted
in
the
disclosure
that
at
four
portsnamely
oswego
toledo
sandusky
and
milwaukeethe
treasury
had
by
false
entries
been
defrauded
within
the
four
years
next
preceding
march
of
the
sum
of
the
great
difficulty
with
which
the
detection
of
these
frauds
has
been
attended
in
consequence
of
the
abstraction
of
books
and
papers
by
the
retiring
officers
and
the
facility
with
which
similar
frauds
in
the
public
service
may
be
perpetrated
render
the
necessity
of
new
legal
enactments
in
the
respects
above
referred
to
quite
obvious
for
other
material
modifications
of
the
revenue
laws
which
seem
to
me
desirable
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
report
and
the
tables
which
accompany
it
furnish
ample
proofs
of
the
solid
foundation
on
which
the
financial
security
of
the
country
rests
and
of
the
salutary
influence
of
the
independenttreasury
system
upon
commerce
and
all
monetary
operations
the
experience
of
the
last
year
furnishes
additional
reasons
i
regret
to
say
of
a
painful
character
for
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
to
provide
for
increasing
the
military
force
employed
in
the
territory
inhabited
by
the
indians
the
settlerson
the
frontier
have
suffered
much
from
the
incursions
of
predatory
bands
and
large
parties
of
emigrants
to
our
pacific
possessions
have
been
massacred
with
impunity
the
recurrence
of
such
scenes
can
only
be
prevented
by
teaching
these
wild
tribes
the
power
of
and
their
responsibility
to
the
united

states
from
the
garrisons
of
our
frontier
posts
it
is
only
possible
to
detach
troops
in
small
bodies
and
though
these
have
on
all
occasions
displayed
a
gallantry
and
a
stern
devotion
to
duty
which
on
a
larger
field
would
have
commanded
universal
admiration
they
have
usually
suffered
severely
in
these
conflicts
with
superior
numbers
and
have
sometimes
been
entirely
sacrificed
all
the
disposable
force
of
the
army
is
already
employed
on
this
service
and
is
known
to
be
wholly
inadequate
to
the
protection
which
should
be
afforded
the
public
mind
of
the
country
has
been
recently
shocked
by
savage
atrocities
committed
upon
defenseless
emigrants
and
border
settlements
and
hardly
less
by
the
unnecessary
destruction
of
valuable
lives
where
inadequate
detachments
of
troops
have
undertaken
to
furnish
the
needed
aid
without
increase
of
the
military
force
these
scenes
will
be
repeated
it
is
to
be
feared
on
a
larger
scale
and
with
more
disastrous
consequences
congress
i
am
sure
will
perceive
that
the
plainest
duties
and
responsibilities
of
government
are
involved
in
this
question
and
i
doubt
not
that
prompt
action
may
be
confidently
anticipated
when
delay
must
be
attended
by
such
fearful
hazards
the
bill
of
the
last
session
providing
for
an
increase
of
the
pay
of
the
rank
and
file
of
the
army
has
had
beneficial
results
not
only
in
facilitating
enlistments
but
in
obvious
improvement
in
the
class
of
men
who
enter
the
service
i
regret
that
corresponding
consideration
was
not
bestowed
on
the
officers
who
in
view
of
their
character
and
services
and
the
expenses
to
which
they
are
necessarily
subject
receive
at
present
what
is
in
my
judgment
inadequate
compensation
the
valuable
services
constantly
rendered
by
the
army
and
its
inestimable
importance
as
the
nucleus
around
which
the
volunteer
forces
of
the
nation
can
promptly
gather
in
the
hour
of
danger
sufficiently
attest
the
wisdom
of
maintaining
a
military
peace
establishment
but
the
theory
of
our
system
and
the
wise
practice
under
it
require
that
any
proposed
augmentation
in
time
of
peace
be
only
commensurate
with
our
extended
limits
and
frontier
relations
while
scrupulously
adhering
to
this
principle
i
find
in
existing
circumstances
a
necessity
for
increase
of
our
military
force
and
it
is
believed
that
four
new
regiments
two
of
infantry
and
two
of
mounted
men
will
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
present
exigency
if
it
were
necessary
carefully
to
weigh
the
cost
in
a
case
of
such
urgency
it
would
be
shown
that
the
additional
expense
would
be
comparatively
light
with
the
increase
of
the
numerical
force
of
the
army
should
i
think
be
combined
certain
measures
of
reform
in
its
organic
arrangement
and
administration
the
present
organization
is
the
result
of
partial
legislation
often
directed
to
special
objects
and
interests
and
the
laws
regulating
rank
and
command
having
been
adopted
many
years
ago
from
the
british
code
are
not
always
applicable
to
our
service
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
the
system
should
be
deficient
in
the
symmetry
and
simplicity
essential
to
the
harmonious
working
of
its
several
parts
and
require
a
careful
revision
the
present
organization
by
maintaining
large
staff
corps
or
departments
separates
many
officers
from
that
close
connection
with
troops
and
those
active
duties
in
the
field
which
are
deemed
requisite
to
qualify
them
for
the
varied
responsibilities
of
high
command
were
the
duties
of
the
army
staff
mainly
discharged
by
officers
detached
from
their
regiments
it
is
believed
that
the
special
service
would
be
equally
well
performed
and
the
discipline
and
instruction
of
the
army
be
improved
while
due
regard
to
the
security
of
the
rights
of
officers
and
to
the
nice
sense
of
honor
which
should
be
cultivated
among
them
would
seem
to
exact
compliance
with
the
established
rule
of
promotion
in
ordinary
cases
still
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
range
of
promotion
by
selection
which
is
now
practically
confined
to
the
grade
of
general
officers
might
be
somewhat
extended
with
benefit
to
the
public
service
observance
of
the
rule
of
seniority
sometimes
leads
especially
in
time
of
peace
to
the
promotion
of
officers
who
after
meritorious
and
even
distinguished
service
may
have
been
rendered
by
age
or
infirmity
incapable
of
performing
active
duty
and
whose
advancement
therefore
would
tend
to
impair
the
efficiency
of
the
army
suitable
provision
for
this
class
of
officers
by
the
creation
of
a
retired
list
would
remedy
the
evil
without
wounding
the
just
pride
of
men
who
by
past
services
have
established
a
claim
to
high
consideration
in
again
commending
this
measure
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
i
would
suggest
that
the
power
of
placing
officers
on
the
retired
list
be
limited
to
one
year
the
practical
operation
of
the
measure
would
thus
be
tested
and
if
after
the
lapse
of
years
there
should
be
occasion
to
renew
the
provision
it
can
be
reproduced
with
any
improvements
which
experience
may
indicate
the
present
organization
of
the
artillery
into
regiments
is
liable
to
obvious
objections
the
service
of
artillery
is
that
of
batteries
and
an
organization
of
batteries
into
a
corps
of
artillery
would
be
more
consistent
with
the
nature
of
their
duties
a
large
part
of
the
troops
now
called
artillery
are
and
have
been
on
duty
as
infantry
the
distinction
between
the
two
arms
being
merely
nominal
this
nominal
artillery
in
our
service
is
disproportionate
to
the
whole
force
and
greater
than
the
wants
of
the
country
demand
i
therefore
commend
the
discontinuance
of
a
distinction
which
has
no
foundation
in
either
the
arms
used
or
the
character
of
the
service
expected
to
be
performed
in
connection
with
the
proposition
for
the
increase
of
the
army
i
have
presented
these
suggestions
with
regard
to
certain
measures
of
reform
as
the
complement
of
a
system
which
would
produce
the
happiest
results
from
a
given
expenditure
and
which
i
hope
may
attract
the
early
attention
and
be
deemed
worthy
of
the
approval
of
congress
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
having
reference
to
more
ample
provisions
for
the
discipline
and
general
improvement
in
the
character
of
seamen
and
for
the
reorganization
and
gradual
increase
of
the
navy
i
deem
eminently
worthy
of
your
favorable
consideration
the
principles
which
have
controlled
our
policy
in
relation
to
the
permanent
military
force
by
sea
and
land
are
sound
consistent
with
the
theory
of
our
system
and
should
by
no
means
be
disregarded
but
limiting
the
force
to
the
objects
particularly
set
forth
in
the
preceding
part
of
this
message
we
should
not
overlook
the
present
magnitude
and
prospective
extension
of
our
commercial
marine
nor
fail
to
give
due
weight
to
the
fact
that
besides
the
miles
of
atlantic
seaboard
we
have
now
a
pacific
coast
stretching
from
mexico
to
the
british
possessions
in
the
north
teeming
with
wealth
and
enterprise
and
demanding
the
constant
presence
of
ships
of
war
the
augmentation
of
the
navy
has
not
kept
pace
with
the
duties
properly
and
profitably
assigned
to
it
in
time
of
peace
and
it
is
inadequate
for
the
large
field
of
its
operations
not
merely
in
the
present
but
still
more
in
the
progressively
increasing
exigencies
of
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
i
cordially
approve
of
the
proposed
apprentice
system
for
our
national
vessels
recommended
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
occurrence
during
the
last
few
months
of
marine
disasters
of
the
most
tragic
nature
involving
great
loss
of
human
life
has
produced
intense
emotions
of
sympathy
and
sorrow
throughout
the
country
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
all
these
calamitous
events
are
wholly
attributable
to
the
necessary
and
inevitable
dangers
of
the
sea
the
merchants
mariners
and
shipbuilders
of
the
united
states
are
it
is
true
unsurpassed
in
farreaching
enterprise
skill
intelligence
and
courage
by
any
others
in
the
world
but
with
the
increasing
amount
of
our
commercial
tonnage
in
the
aggregate
and
the
larger
size
and
improved
equipment
of
the
ships
now
constructed
a
deficiency
in
the
supply
of
reliable
seamen
begins
to
be
very
seriously
felt
the
inconvenience
may
perhaps
be
met
in
part
by
due
regulation
for
the
introduction
into
our
merchant
ships
of
indented
apprentices
which
while
it
would
afford
useful
and
eligible
occupation
to
numerous
young
men
would
have
a
tendency
to
raise
the
character
of
seamen
as
a
class
and
it
is
deserving
of
serious
reflection
whether
it
may
not
be
desirable
to
revise
the
existing
laws
for
the
maintenance
of
discipline
at
sea
upon
which
the
security
of
life
and
property
on
the
ocean
must
to
so
great
an
extent
depend
although
much
attention
has
already
been
given
by
congress
to
the
proper
construction
and
arrangement
of
steam
vessels
and
all
passenger
ships
still
it
is
believed
that
the
resources
of
science
and
mechanical
skill
in
this
direction
have
not
been
exhausted
no
good
reason
exists
for
the
marked
distinction
which
appears
upon
our
statutes
between
the
laws
for
protecting
life
and
property
at
sea
and
those
for
protecting
them
on
land
in
most
of
the
states
severe
penalties
are
provided
to
punish
conductors
of
trains
engineers
and
others
employed
in
the
transportation
of
persons
by
railway
or
by
steamboats
on
rivers
why
should
not
the
same
principle
be
applied
to
acts
of
insubordination
cowardice
or
other
misconduct
on
the
part
of
masters
and
mariners
producing
injury
or
death
to
passengers
on
the
high
seas
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
any
of
the
states
and
where
such
delinquencies
can
be
reached
only
by
the
power
of
congress
the
whole
subject
is
earnestly
commended
to
your
consideration
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
to
which
you
are
referred
for
many
interesting
details
in
relation
to
this
important
and
rapidly
extending
branch
of
the
public
service
shows
that
the
expenditure
of
the
year
ending
june
including
of
balance
due
to
foreign
offices
amounted
to
the
gross
receipts
during
the
same
period
amounted
to
exhibiting
an
expenditure
over
income
of
and
a
diminution
of
deficiency
as
compared
with
the
last
year
of
the
increase
of
th
e
revenue
of
the
department
for
the
year
ending
june
over
the
preceding
year
was
no
proportionate
increase
however
can
be
anticipated
for
the
current
year
in
consequence
of
the
act
of
congress
of
june
providing
for
increased
compensation
to
all
postmasters
from
these
statements
it
is
apparent
that
the
postoffice
department
instead
of
defraying
its
expenses
according
to
the
design
at
the
time
of
its
creation
is
now
and
under
existing
laws
must
continue
to
be
to
no
small
extent
a
charge
upon
the
general
treasury
the
cost
of
mail
transportation
during
the
year
ending
june
exceeds
the
cost
of
the
preceding
year
by
i
again
call
your
attention
to
the
subject
of
mail
transportation
by
ocean
steamers
and
commend
the
suggestions
of
the
postmaster
general
to
your
early
attention
during
the
last
fiscal
year
acres
of
the
public
lands
have
been
surveyed
and
acres
brought
into
market
the
number
of
acres
sold
is
and
the
amount
received
therefor
the
aggregate
amount
of
lands
sold
located
under
military
scrip
and
land
warrants
selected
as
swamp
lands
by
states
and
by
locating
under
grants
for
roads
is
upward
of
acres
the
increase
of
lands
sold
over
the
previous
year
is
about
acres
and
the
sales
during
the
first
two
quarters
of
the
current
year
present
the
extraordinary
result
of
five
and
a
half
millions
sold
exceeding
by
nearly
acres
the
sales
of
the
corresponding
quarters
of
the
last
year
the
commendable
policy
of
the
government
in
relation
to
setting
apart
public
domain
for
those
who
have
served
their
country
in
time
of
war
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
since
no
less
than
acres
have
been
applied
to
this
object
the
suggestions
which
i
submitted
in
my
annual
message
of
last
year
in
reference
to
grants
of
land
in
aid
of
the
construction
of
railways
were
less
full
and
explicit
than
the
magnitude
of
the
subject
and
subsequent
developments
would
seem
to
render
proper
and
desirable
of
the
soundness
of
the
principle
then
asserted
with
regard
to
the
limitation
of
the
power
of
congress
i
entertain
no
doubt
but
in
its
application
it
is
not
enough
that
the
value
of
lands
in
a
particular
locality
may
be
enhanced
that
in
fact
a
larger
amount
of
money
may
probably
be
received
in
a
given
time
for
alternate
sections
than
could
have
been
realized
for
all
the
sections
without
the
impulse
and
influence
of
the
proposed
improvements
a
prudent
proprietor
looks
beyond
limited
sections
of
his
domain
beyond
present
results
to
the
ultimate
effect
which
a
particular
line
of
policy
is
likely
to
produce
upon
all
his
possessions
and
interests
the
government
which
is
trustee
in
this
matter
for
the
people
of
the
states
is
bound
to
take
the
same
wise
and
comprehensive
view
prior
to
and
during
the
last
session
of
congress
upward
of
acres
of
land
were
withdrawn
from
public
sale
with
a
view
to
applications
for
grants
of
this
character
pending
before
congress
a
careful
review
of
the
whole
subject
led
me
to
direct
that
all
such
orders
be
abrogated
and
the
lands
restored
to
market
and
instructions
were
immediately
given
to
that
effect
the
applications
at
the
last
session
contemplated
the
construction
of
more
than
miles
of
road
and
grants
to
the
amount
of
nearly
acres
of
the
public
domain
even
admitting
the
right
on
the
part
of
congress
to
be
unquestionable
is
it
quite
clear
that
the
proposed
grants
would
be
productive
of
good
and
not
evil
the
different
projects
are
confined
for
the
present
to
eleven
states
of
this
union
and
one
territory
the
reasons
assigned
for
the
grants
show
that
it
is
proposed
to
put
the
works
speedily
in
process
of
construction
when
we
reflect
that
since
the
commencement
of
the
construction
of
railways
in
the
united
states
stimulated
as
they
have
been
by
the
large
dividends
realized
from
the
earlier
works
over
the
great
thoroughfares
and
between
the
most
important
points
of
commerce
and
population
encouraged
by
state
legislation
and
pressed
forward
by
the
amazing
energy
of
private
enterprise
only
miles
have
been
completed
in
all
the
states
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
when
we
see
the
crippled
condition
of
many
works
commenced
and
prosecuted
upon
what
were
deemed
to
be
sound
principles
and
safe
calculations
when
we
contemplate
the
enormous
absorption
of
capital
withdrawn
from
the
ordinary
channels
of
business
the
extravagant
rates
of
interest
at
this
moment
paid
to
continue
operations
the
bankruptcies
not
merely
in
money
but
in
character
and
the
inevitable
effect
upon
finances
generally
can
it
be
doubted
that
the
tendency
is
to
run
to
excess
in
this
matter
is
it
wise
to
augment
this
excess
by
encouraging
hopes
of
sudden
wealth
expected
to
flow
from
magnificent
schemes
dependent
upon
the
action
of
congress
does
the
spirit
which
has
produced
such
results
need
to
be
stimulated
or
checked
is
it
not
the
better
rule
to
leave
all
these
works
to
private
enterprise
regulated
and
when
expedient
aided
by
the
cooperation
of
states
if
constructed
by
private
capital
the
stimulant
and
the
check
go
together
and
furnish
a
salutary
restraint
against
speculative
schemes
and
extravagance
but
it
is
manifest
that
with
the
most
effective
guards
there
is
danger
of
going
too
fast
and
too
far
we
may
well
pause
before
a
proposition
contemplating
a
simultaneous
movement
for
the
construction
of
railroads
which
in
extent
will
equal
exclusive
of
the
great
pacific
road
and
all
its
branches
nearly
onethird
of
the
entire
length
of
such
works
now
completed
in
the
united
states
and
which
can
not
cost
with
equipments
less
than
the
dangers
likely
to
result
from
combinations
of
interests
of
this
character
can
hardly
be
overestimated
but
independently
of
these
considerations
where
is
the
accurate
knowledge
the
comprehensive
intelligence
which
shall
discriminate
between
the
relative
claims
of
these
twenty
eight
proposed
roads
in
eleven
states
and
one
territory
where
will
you
begin
and
where
end
if
to
enable
these
companies
to
execute
their
proposed
works
it
is
necessary
that
the
aid
of
the
general
government
be
primarily
given
the
policy
will
present
a
problem
so
comprehensive
in
its
bearings
and
so
important
to
our
political
and
social
wellbeing
as
to
claim
in
anticipation
the
severest
analysis
entertaining
these
views
i
recur
with
satisfaction
to
the
experience
and
action
of
the
last
session
of
congress
as
furnishing
assurance
that
the
subject
will
not
fail
to
elicit
a
careful
reexamination
and
rigid
scrutiny
it
was
my
intention
to
present
on
this
occasion
some
suggestions
regarding
internal
improvements
by
the
general
government
which
want
of
time
at
the
close
of
the
last
session
prevented
my
submitting
on
the
return
to
the
house
of
representatives
with
objections
of
the
bill
entitled
an
act
making
appropriations
for
the
repair
preservation
and
completion
of
certain
public
works
heretofore
commenced
under
the
authority
of
law
but
the
space
in
this
communication
already
occupied
with
other
matter
of
immediate
public
exigency
constrains
me
to
reserve
that
subject
for
a
special
message
which
will
be
transmitted
to
the
two
houses
of
congress
at
an
early
day
the
judicial
establishment
of
the
united
states
requires
modification
and
certain
reforms
in
the
manner
of
conducting
the
legal
business
of
the
government
are
also
much
needed
but
as
i
have
addressed
you
upon
both
of
these
subjects
at
length
before
i
have
only
to
call
your
attention
to
the
suggestions
then
made
my
former
recommendations
in
relation
to
suitable
provision
for
various
objects
of
deep
interest
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
of
columbia
are
renewed
many
of
these
objects
partake
largely
of
a
national
character
and
are
important
independently
of
their
relation
to
the
prosperity
of
the
only
considerable
organized
community
in
the
union
entirely
unrepresented
in
congress
i
have
thus
presented
suggestions
on
such
subjects
as
appear
to
me
to
be
of
particular
interest
or
importance
and
therefore
most
worthy
of
consideration
during
the
short
remaining
period
allotted
to
the
labors
of
the
present
congress
our
forefathers
of
the
thirteen
united
colonies
in
acquiring
their
independence
and
in
rounding
this
republic
of
the
united
states
of
america
have
devolved
upon
us
their
descendants
the
greatest
and
the
most
noble
trust
ever
committed
to
the
hands
of
man
imposing
upon
all
and
especially
such
as
the
public
will
may
have
invested
for
the
time
being
with
political
functions
the
most
sacred
obligations
we
have
to
maintain
inviolate
the
great
doctrine
of
the
inherent
right
of
popular
selfgovernment
to
reconcile
the
largest
liberty
of
the
individual
citizen
with
complete
security
of
the
public
order
to
render
cheerful
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
land
to
unite
in
enforcing
their
execution
and
to
frown
indignantly
on
all
combinations
to
resist
them
to
harmonize
a
sincere
and
ardent
devotion
to
the
institutions
of
religions
faith
with
the
most
universal
religious
toleration
to
preserve
the
rights
of
all
by
causing
each
to
respect
those
of
the
other
to
carry
forward
every
social
improvement
to
the
uttermost
limit
of
human
perfectibility
by
the
free
action
of
mind
upon
mind
not
by
the
obtrusive
intervention
of
misapplied
force
to
uphold
the
integrity
and
guard
the
limitations
of
our
organic
law
to
preserve
sacred
from
all
touch
of
usurpation
as
the
very
palladium
of
our
political
salvation
the
reserved
rights
and
powers
of
the
several
states
and
of
the
people
to
cherish
with
loyal
fealty
and
devoted
affection
this
union
as
the
only
sure
foundation
on
which
the
hopes
of
civil
liberty
rest
to
administer
government
with
vigilant
integrity
and
rigid
economy
to
cultivate
peace
and
friendship
with
foreign
nations
and
to
demand
and
exact
equal
justice
from
all
but
to
do
wrong
to
none
to
eschew
intermeddling
with
the
national
policy
and
the
domestic
repose
of
other
governments
and
to
repel
it
from
our
own
never
to
shrink
from
war
when
the
rights
and
the
honor
of
the
country
call
us
to
arms
but
to
cultivate
in
preference
the
arts
of
peace
seek
enlargement
of
the
rights
of
neutrality
and
elevate
and
liberalize
the
intercourse
of
nations
and
b
y
such
just
and
honorable
means
and
such
only
whilst
exalting
the
condition
of
the
republic
to
assure
to
it
the
legitimate
influence
and
the
benign
authority
of
a
great
example
amongst
all
the
powers
of
christendom
under
the
solemnity
of
these
convictions
the
blessing
of
almighty
god
is
earnestly
invoked
to
attend
upon
your
deliberations
and
upon
all
the
counsels
and
acts
of
the
government
to
the
end
that
with
common
zeal
and
common
efforts
we
may
in
humble
submission
to
the
divine
will
cooperate
for
the
promotion
of
the
supreme
good
of
these
united
states

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
interest
with
which
the
people
of
the
republic
anticipate
the
assembling
of
congress
and
the
fulfillment
on
that
occasion
of
the
duty
imposed
upon
a
new
president
is
one
of
the
best
evidences
of
their
capacity
to
realize
the
hopes
of
the
founders
of
a
political
system
at
once
complex
and
symmetrical
while
the
different
branches
of
the
government
are
to
a
certain
extent
independent
of
each
other
the
duties
of
all
alike
have
direct
reference
to
the
source
of
power
fortunately
under
this
system
no
man
is
so
high
and
none
so
humble
in
the
scale
of
public
station
as
to
escape
from
the
scrutiny
or
to
be
exempt
from
the
responsibility
which
all
official
functions
imply
upon
the
justice
and
intelligence
of
the
masses
in
a
government
thus
organized
is
the
sole
reliance
of
the
confederacy
and
the
only
security
for
honest
and
earnest
devotion
to
its
interests
against
the
usurpations
and
encroachment
of
power
on
the
one
hand
and
the
assaults
of
personal
ambition
on
the
other
the
interest
of
which
i
have
spoken
is
inseparable
from
an
inquiring
selfgoverning
community
but
stimulated
doubtless
at
the
present
time
by
the
unsettled
condition
of
our
relations
with
several
foreign
powers
by
the
new
obligations
resulting
from
a
sudden
extension
of
the
field
of
enterprise
by
the
spirit
with
which
that
field
has
been
entered
and
the
amazing
energy
with
which
its
resources
for
meeting
the
demands
of
humanity
have
been
developed
although
disease
assuming
at
one
time
the
characteristics
of
a
widespread
and
devastating
pestilence
has
left
its
sad
traces
upon
some
portions
of
our
country
we
have
still
the
most
abundant
cause
for
reverent
thankfulness
to
god
for
an
accumulation
of
signal
mercies
showered
upon
us
as
a
nation
it
is
well
that
a
consciousness
of
rapid
advancement
and
increasing
strength
be
habitually
associated
with
an
abiding
sense
of
dependence
upon
him
who
holds
in
his
hands
the
destiny
of
men
and
of
nations
recognizing
the
wisdom
of
the
broad
principle
of
absolute
religious
toleration
proclaimed
in
our
fundamental
law
and
rejoicing
in
the
benign
influence
which
it
has
exerted
upon
our
social
and
political
condition
i
should
shrink
from
a
clear
duty
did
i
fail
to
express
my
deepest
conviction
that
we
can
place
no
secure
reliance
upon
any
apparent
progress
if
it
be
not
sustained
by
national
integrity
resting
upon
the
great
truths
affirmed
and
illustrated
by
divine
revelation
in
the
midst
of
our
sorrow
for
the
afflicted
and
suffering
it
has
been
consoling
to
see
how
promptly
disaster
made
true
neighbors
of
districts
and
cities
separated
widely
from
each
other
and
cheering
to
watch
the
strength
of
that
common
bond
of
brotherhood
which
unites
all
hearts
in
all
parts
of
this
union
when
danger
threatens
from
abroad
or
calamity
impends
over
us
at
home
our
diplomatic
relations
with
foreign
powers
have
undergone
no
essential
change
since
the
adjournment
of
the
last
congress
with
some
of
them
questions
of
a
disturbing
character
are
still
pending
but
there
are
good
reasons
to
believe
that
these
may
all
be
amicably
adjusted
for
some
years
past
great
britain
has
so
construed
the
first
article
of
the
convention
of
the
th
of
april
in
regard
to
the
fisheries
on
the
northeastern
coast
as
to
exclude
our
citizens
from
some
of
the
fishing
grounds
to
which
they
freely
resorted
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
subsequent
to
the
date
of
that
treaty
the
united
states
have
never
acquiesced
in
this
construction
but
have
always
claimed
for
their
fishermen
all
the
rights
which
they
had
so
long
enjoyed
without
molestation
with
a
view
to
remove
all
difficulties
on
the
subject
to
extend
the
rights
of
our
fishermen
beyond
the
limits
fixed
by
the
convention
of
and
to
regulate
trade
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
north
american
provinces
a
negotiation
has
been
opened
with
a
fair
prospect
of
a
favorable
result
to
protect
our
fishermen
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
rights
and
prevent
collision
between
them
and
british
fishermen
i
deemed
it
expedient
to
station
a
naval
force
in
that
quarter
during
the
fishing
season
embarrassing
questions
have
also
arisen
between
the
two
governments
in
regard
to
central
america
great
britain
has
proposed
to
settle
them
by
an
amicable
arrangement
and
our
minister
at
london
is
instructed
to
enter
into
negotiations
on
that
subject
a
commission
for
adjusting
the
claims
of
our
citizens
against
great
britain
and
those
of
british
subjects
against
the
united
states
organized
under
the
convention
of
the
th
of
february
last
is
now
sitting
in
london
for
the
transaction
of
business
it
is
in
many
respects
desirable
that
the
boundary
line
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
provinces
in
the
northwest
as
designated
in
the
convention
of
the
th
of
june
and
especially
that
part
which
separates
the
territory
of
washington
from
the
british
possessions
on
the
north
should
be
traced
and
marked
i
therefore
present
the
subject
to
your
notice
with
france
our
relations
continue
on
the
most
friendly
footing
the
extensive
commerce
between
the
united
states
and
that
country
might
it
is
conceived
be
released
from
some
unnecessary
restrictions
to
the
mutual
advantage
of
both
parties
with
a
view
to
this
object
some
progress
has
been
made
in
negotiating
a
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
independently
of
our
valuable
trade
with
spain
we
have
important
political
relations
with
her
growing
out
of
our
neighborhood
to
the
islands
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
since
the
last
congress
no
attempts
have
been
made
by
unauthorized
expeditions
within
the
united
states
against
either
of
those
colonies
should
any
movement
be
manifested
within
our
limits
all
the
means
at
my
command
will
be
vigorously
exerted
to
repress
it
several
annoying
occurrences
have
taken
place
at
havana
or
in
the
vicinity
of
the
island
of
cuba
between
our
citizens
and
the
spanish
authorities
considering
the
proximity
of
that
island
to
our
shores
lying
as
it
does
in
the
track
of
trade
between
some
of
our
principal
cities
and
the
suspicious
vigilance
with
which
foreign
intercourse
particularly
that
with
the
united
states
is
there
guarded
a
repetition
of
such
occurrences
may
well
be
apprehended
as
no
diplomatic
intercourse
is
allowed
between
our
consul
at
havana
and
the
captaingeneral
of
cuba
ready
explanations
can
not
be
made
or
prompt
redress
afforded
where
injury
has
resulted
all
complaint
on
the
part
of
our
citizens
under
the
present
arrangement
must
be
in
the
first
place
presented
to
this
government
and
then
referred
to
spain
spain
again
refers
it
to
her
local
authorities
in
cuba
for
investigation
and
postpones
an
answer
till
she
has
heard
from
those
authorities
to
avoid
these
irritating
and
vexatious
delays
a
proposition
has
been
made
to
provide
for
a
direct
appeal
for
redress
to
the
captaingeneral
by
our
consul
in
behalf
of
our
injured
fellowcitizens
hitherto
the
government
of
spain
has
declined
to
enter
into
any
such
arrangement
this
course
on
her
part
is
deeply
regretted
for
without
some
arrangement
of
this
kind
the
good
understanding
between
the
two
countries
may
be
exposed
to
occasional
interruption
our
minister
at
madrid
is
instructed
to
renew
the
proposition
and
to
press
it
again
upon
the
consideration
of
her
catholic
majestys
government
for
several
years
spain
has
been
calling
the
attention
of
this
government
to
a
claim
for
losses
by
some
of
her
subjects
in
the
case
of
the
schooner
amistad
this
claim
is
believed
to
rest
on
the
obligations
imposed
by
our
existing
treaty
with
that
country
its
justice
was
admitted
in
our
diplomatic
correspondence
with
the
spanish
government
as
early
as
march
and
one
of
my
predecessors
in
his
annual
message
of
that
year
recommended
that
provision
should
be
made
for
its
payment
in
january
last
it
was
again
submitted
to
congress
by
the
executive
it
has
received
a
favorable
consideration
by
committees
of
both
branches
but
as
yet
there
has
been
no
final
action
upon
it
i
conceive
that
good
faith
requires
its
prompt
adjustment
and
i
present
it
to
your
early
and
favorable
consideration
martin
koszta
a
hungarian
by
birth
came
to
this
country
in
and
declared
his
intention
in
due
form
of
law
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
after
remaining
here
nearly
two
years
he
visited
turkey
while
at
smyrna
he
was
forcibly
seized
taken
on
board
an
austrian
brig
of
war
then
lying
in
the
harbor
of
that
place
and
there
confined
in
irons
with
the
avowed
design
to
take
him
into
the
dominions
of
austria
our
consul
at
smyrna
and
legation
at
constantinople
interposed
for
his
release
but
their
efforts
were
ineffectual
while
thus
in
prison
commander
ingraham
with
the
united
states
ship
of
war
st
louis
arrived
at
smyrna
and
after
inquiring
into
the
circumstances
of
the
case
came
to
the
conclusion
that
koszta
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
this
government
and
took
energetic
and
prompt
measures
for
his
release
under
an
arrangement
between
the
agents
of
the
united
states
and
of
austria
he
was
transferred
to
the
custody
of
the
french
consulgeneral
at
smyrna
there
to
remain
until
he
should
be
disposed
of
by
the
mutual
agreement
of
the
consuls
of
the
respective
governments
at
that
place
pursuant
to
that
agreement
he
has
been
released
and
is
now
in
the
united
states
the
emperor
of
austria
has
made
the
conduct
of
our
officers
who
took
part
in
this
transaction
a
subject
of
grave
complaint
regarding
koszta
as
still
his
subject
and
claiming
a
right
to
seize
him
within
the
limits
of
the
turkish
empire
he
has
demanded
of
this
government
its
consent
to
the
surrender
of
the
prisoner
a
disavowal
of
the
acts
of
its
agents
and
satisfaction
for
the
alleged
outrage
after
a
careful
consideration
of
the
case
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
koszta
was
seized
without
legal
authority
at
smyrna
that
he
was
wrongfully
detained
on
board
of
the
austrian
brig
of
war
that
at
the
time
of
his
seizure
he
was
clothed
with
the
nationality
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
acts
of
our
officers
under
the
circumsta
nces
of
the
case
were
justifiable
and
their
conduct
has
been
fully
approved
by
me
and
a
compliance
with
the
several
demands
of
the
emperor
of
austria
has
been
declined
for
a
more
full
account
of
this
transaction
and
my
views
in
regard
to
it
i
refer
to
the
correspondence
between
the
charge
daffaires
of
austria
and
the
secretary
of
state
which
is
herewith
transmitted
the
principles
and
policy
therein
maintained
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
will
whenever
a
proper
occasion
occurs
be
applied
and
enforced
the
condition
of
china
at
this
time
renders
it
probable
that
some
important
changes
will
occur
in
that
vast
empire
which
will
lead
to
a
more
unrestricted
intercourse
with
it
the
commissioner
to
that
country
who
has
been
recently
appointed
is
instructed
to
avail
himself
of
all
occasions
to
open
and
extend
our
commercial
relations
not
only
with
the
empire
of
china
but
with
other
asiatic
nations
in
an
expedition
was
sent
to
japan
under
the
command
of
commodore
perry
for
the
purpose
of
opening
commercial
intercourse
with
that
empire
intelligence
has
been
received
of
his
arrival
there
and
of
his
having
made
known
to
the
emperor
of
japan
the
object
of
his
visit
but
it
is
not
yet
ascertained
how
far
the
emperor
will
be
disposed
to
abandon
his
restrictive
policy
and
open
that
populous
country
to
a
commercial
intercourse
with
the
united
states
it
has
been
my
earnest
desire
to
maintain
friendly
intercourse
with
the
governments
upon
this
continent
and
to
aid
them
in
preserving
good
understanding
among
themselves
with
mexico
a
dispute
has
arisen
as
to
the
true
boundary
line
between
our
territory
of
new
mexico
and
the
mexican
state
of
chihuahua
a
former
commissioner
of
the
united
states
employed
in
running
that
line
pursuant
to
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
made
a
serious
mistake
in
determining
the
initial
point
on
the
rio
grande
but
inasmuch
as
his
decision
was
clearly
a
departure
from
the
directions
for
tracing
the
boundary
contained
in
that
treaty
and
was
not
concurred
in
by
the
surveyor
appointed
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
whose
concurrence
was
necessary
to
give
validity
to
that
decision
this
government
is
not
concluded
thereby
but
that
of
mexico
takes
a
different
view
of
the
subject
there
are
also
other
questions
of
considerable
magnitude
pending
between
the
two
republics
our
minister
in
mexico
has
ample
instructions
to
adjust
them
negotiations
have
been
opened
but
sufficient
progress
has
not
been
made
therein
to
enable
me
to
speak
of
the
probable
result
impressed
with
the
importance
of
maintaining
amicable
relations
with
that
republic
and
of
yielding
with
liberality
to
all
her
just
claims
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
an
arrangement
mutually
satisfactory
to
both
countries
may
be
concluded
and
a
lasting
friendship
between
them
confirmed
and
perpetuated
congress
having
provided
for
a
full
mission
to
the
states
of
central
america
a
minister
was
sent
thither
in
july
last
as
yet
he
has
had
time
to
visit
only
one
of
these
states
nicaragua
where
he
was
received
in
the
most
friendly
manner
it
is
hoped
that
his
presence
and
good
offices
will
have
a
benign
effect
in
composing
the
dissensions
which
prevail
among
them
and
in
establishing
still
more
intimate
and
friendly
relations
between
them
respectively
and
between
each
of
them
and
the
united
states
considering
the
vast
regions
of
this
continent
and
the
number
of
states
which
would
be
made
accessible
by
the
free
navigation
of
the
river
amazon
particular
attention
has
been
given
to
this
subject
brazil
through
whose
territories
it
passes
into
the
ocean
has
hitherto
persisted
in
a
policy
so
restricted
in
regard
to
the
use
of
this
river
as
to
obstruct
and
nearly
exclude
foreign
commercial
intercourse
with
the
states
which
lie
upon
its
tributaries
and
upper
branches
our
minister
to
that
country
is
instructed
to
obtain
a
relaxation
of
that
policy
and
to
use
his
efforts
to
induce
the
brazilian
government
to
open
to
common
use
under
proper
safeguards
this
great
natural
highway
for
international
trade
several
of
the
south
american
states
are
deeply
interested
in
this
attempt
to
secure
the
free
navigation
of
the
amazon
and
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
their
cooperation
in
the
measure
as
the
advantages
of
free
commercial
intercourse
among
nations
are
better
understood
more
liberal
views
are
generally
entertained
as
to
the
common
rights
of
all
to
the
free
use
of
those
means
which
nature
has
provided
for
international
communication
to
these
more
liberal
and
enlightened
views
it
is
hoped
that
brazil
will
conform
her
policy
and
remove
all
unnecessary
restrictions
upon
the
free
use
of
a
river
which
traverses
so
many
states
and
so
large
a
part
of
the
continent
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
the
republic
of
paraguay
and
the
argentine
confederation
have
yielded
to
the
liberal
policy
still
resisted
by
brazil
in
regard
to
the
navigable
rivers
within
their
respective
territories
treaties
embracing
this
subject
among
others
have
been
negotiated
with
these
governments
which
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
at
the
present
session
a
new
branch
of
commerce
important
to
the
agricultural
interests
of
the
united
states
has
within
a
few
years
past
been
opened
with
peru
notwithstanding
the
inexhaustible
deposits
of
guano
upon
the
islands
of
that
country
considerable
difficulties
are
experienced
in
obtaining
the
requisite
supply
measures
have
been
taken
to
remove
these
difficulties
and
to
secure
a
more
abundant
importation
of
the
article
unfortunately
there
has
been
a
serious
collision
between
our
citizens
who
have
resorted
to
the
chincha
islands
for
it
and
the
peruvian
authorities
stationed
there
redress
for
the
outrages
committed
by
the
latter
was
promptly
demanded
by
our
minister
at
lima
this
subject
is
now
under
consideration
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
peru
is
disposed
to
offer
adequate
indemnity
to
the
aggrieved
parties
we
are
thus
not
only
at
peace
with
all
foreign
countries
but
in
regard
to
political
affairs
are
exempt
from
any
cause
of
serious
disquietude
in
our
domestic
relations
the
controversies
which
have
agitated
the
country
heretofore
are
passing
away
with
the
causes
which
produced
them
and
the
passions
which
they
had
awakened
or
if
any
trace
of
them
remains
it
may
be
reasonably
hoped
that
it
will
only
be
perceived
in
the
zealous
rivalry
of
all
good
citizens
to
testify
their
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
states
their
devotion
to
the
union
and
their
common
determination
that
each
one
of
the
states
its
institutions
its
welfare
and
its
domestic
peace
shall
be
held
alike
secure
under
the
sacred
aegis
of
the
constitution
this
new
league
of
amity
and
of
mutual
confidence
and
support
into
which
the
people
of
the
republic
have
entered
happily
affords
inducement
and
opportunity
for
the
adoption
of
a
more
comprehensive
and
unembarrassed
line
of
policy
and
action
as
to
the
great
material
interests
of
the
country
whether
regarded
in
themselves
or
in
connection
with
the
powers
of
the
civilized
world
the
united
states
have
continued
gradually
and
steadily
to
expand
through
acquisitions
of
territory
which
how
much
soever
some
of
them
may
have
been
questioned
are
now
universally
seen
and
admitted
to
have
been
wise
in
policy
just
in
character
and
a
great
element
in
the
advancement
of
our
country
and
with
it
of
the
human
race
in
freedom
in
prosperity
and
in
happiness
the
thirteen
states
have
grown
to
be
thirtyone
with
relations
reaching
to
europe
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
to
the
distant
realms
of
asia
i
am
deeply
sensible
of
the
immense
responsibility
which
the
present
magnitude
of
the
republic
and
the
diversity
and
multiplicity
of
its
interests
devolves
upon
me
the
alleviation
of
which
so
far
as
relates
to
the
immediate
conduct
of
the
public
business
is
first
in
my
reliance
on
the
wisdom
and
patriotism
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
and
secondly
in
the
directions
afforded
me
by
the
principles
of
public
polity
affirmed
by
our
fathers
of
the
epoch
of
sanctioned
by
long
experience
and
consecrated
anew
by
the
overwhelming
voice
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
recurring
to
these
principles
which
constitute
the
organic
basis
of
union
we
perceive
that
vast
as
are
the
functions
and
the
duties
of
the
federal
government
vested
in
or
intrusted
to
its
three
great
departmentsthe
legislative
executive
and
judicialyet
the
substantive
power
the
popular
force
and
the
large
capacities
for
social
and
material
development
exist
in
the
respective
states
which
all
being
of
themselves
wellconstituted
republics
as
they
preceded
so
they
alone
are
capable
of
maintaining
and
perpetuating
the
american
union
the
federal
government
has
its
appropriate
line
of
action
in
the
specific
and
limited
powers
conferred
on
it
by
the
constitution
chiefly
as
to
those
things
in
which
the
states
have
a
common
interest
in
their
relations
to
one
another
and
to
foreign
governments
while
the
great
mass
of
interests
which
belong
to
cultivated
menthe
ordinary
business
of
life
the
springs
of
industry
all
the
diversified
personal
and
domestic
affairs
of
societyrest
securely
upon
the
general
reserved
powers
of
the
people
of
the
several
states
there
is
the
effective
democracy
of
the
nation
and
there
the
vital
essence
of
its
being
and
its
greatness
of
the
practical
consequences
which
flow
from
the
nature
of
the
federal
government
the
primary
one
is
the
duty
of
administering
with
integrity
and
fidelity
the
high
trust
reposed
in
it
by
the
constitution
especially
in
the
application
of
the
public
funds
as
drawn
by
taxation
from
the
people
and
appropriated
to
specific
objects
by
congress
happily
i
have
no
occasion
to
suggest
any
radical
changes
in
the
financial
policy
of
the
government
ours
is
almost
if
not
absolutely
the
solitary
power
of
christendom
having
a
surplus
revenue
drawn
immediately
from
imposts
on
commerce
and
therefore
measured
by
the
spontaneous
enterprise
and
national
prosperity
of
the
country
with
such
indirect
relation
to
agriculture
manufactures
and
the
products
of
the
earth
and
sea
as
to
violate
no
constitutional
doctrine
and
y
et
vigorously
promote
the
general
welfare
neither
as
to
the
sources
of
the
public
treasure
nor
as
to
the
manner
of
keeping
and
managing
it
does
any
grave
controversy
now
prevail
there
being
a
general
acquiescence
in
the
wisdom
of
the
present
system
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
exhibit
in
detail
the
state
of
the
public
finances
and
the
condition
of
the
various
branches
of
the
public
service
administered
by
that
department
of
the
government
the
revenue
of
the
country
levied
almost
insensibly
to
the
taxpayer
goes
on
from
year
to
year
increasing
beyond
either
the
interests
or
the
prospective
wants
of
the
government
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
there
remained
in
the
treasury
a
balance
of
the
public
revenue
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
amounted
to
from
customs
and
to
from
public
lands
and
other
miscellaneous
sources
amounting
together
to
while
the
public
expenditures
for
the
same
period
exclusive
of
payments
on
account
of
the
public
debt
amounted
to
leaving
a
balance
of
of
receipts
above
expenditures
this
fact
of
increasing
surplus
in
the
treasury
became
the
subject
of
anxious
consideration
at
a
very
early
period
of
my
administration
and
the
path
of
duty
in
regard
to
it
seemed
to
me
obvious
and
clear
namely
first
to
apply
the
surplus
revenue
to
the
discharge
of
the
public
debt
so
far
as
it
could
judiciously
be
done
and
secondly
to
devise
means
for
the
gradual
reduction
of
the
revenue
to
the
standard
of
the
public
exigencies
of
these
objects
the
first
has
been
in
the
course
of
accomplishment
in
a
manner
and
to
a
degree
highly
satisfactory
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
of
all
classes
was
on
the
th
of
march
payments
on
account
of
which
have
been
made
since
that
period
to
the
amount
of
leaving
unpaid
and
in
continuous
course
of
liquidation
the
sum
of
these
payments
although
made
at
the
market
price
of
the
respective
classes
of
stocks
have
been
effected
readily
and
to
the
general
advantage
of
the
treasury
and
have
at
the
same
time
proved
of
signal
utility
in
the
relief
they
have
incidentally
afforded
to
the
money
market
and
to
the
industrial
and
commercial
pursuits
of
the
country
the
second
of
the
abovementioned
objects
that
of
the
reduction
of
the
tariff
is
of
great
importance
and
the
plan
suggested
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
is
to
reduce
the
duties
on
certain
articles
and
to
add
to
the
free
list
many
articles
now
taxed
and
especially
such
as
enter
into
manufactures
and
are
not
largely
or
at
all
produced
in
the
country
is
commended
to
your
candid
and
careful
consideration
you
will
find
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
also
abundant
proof
of
the
entire
adequacy
of
the
present
fiscal
system
to
meet
all
the
requirements
of
the
public
service
and
that
while
properly
administered
it
operates
to
the
advantage
of
the
community
in
ordinary
business
relations
i
respectfully
ask
your
attention
to
sundry
suggestions
of
improvements
in
the
settlement
of
accounts
especially
as
regards
the
large
sums
of
outstanding
arrears
due
to
the
government
and
of
other
reforms
in
the
administrative
action
of
his
department
which
are
indicated
by
the
secretary
as
also
to
the
progress
made
in
the
construction
of
marine
hospitals
customhouses
and
of
a
new
mint
in
california
and
assay
office
in
the
city
of
new
york
heretofore
provided
for
by
congress
and
also
to
the
eminently
successful
progress
of
the
coast
survey
and
of
the
light
house
board
among
the
objects
meriting
your
attention
will
be
important
recommendations
from
the
secretaries
of
war
and
navy
i
am
fully
satisfied
that
the
navy
of
the
united
states
is
not
in
a
condition
of
strength
and
efficiency
commensurate
with
the
magnitude
of
our
commercial
and
other
interests
and
commend
to
your
especial
attention
the
suggestions
on
this
subject
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
army
which
under
our
system
must
always
be
regarded
with
the
highest
interest
as
a
nucleus
around
which
the
volunteer
forces
of
the
nation
gather
in
the
hour
of
danger
requires
augmentation
or
modification
to
adapt
it
to
the
present
extended
limits
and
frontier
relations
of
the
country
and
the
condition
of
the
indian
tribes
in
the
interior
of
the
continent
the
necessity
of
which
will
appear
in
the
communications
of
the
secretaries
of
war
and
the
interior
in
the
administration
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
the
gross
expenditure
was
and
the
gross
receipts
during
the
same
period
showing
that
the
current
revenue
failed
to
meet
the
current
expenses
of
the
department
by
the
sum
of
the
causes
which
under
the
present
postal
system
and
laws
led
inevitably
to
this
result
are
fully
explained
by
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
one
great
cause
being
the
enormous
rates
the
department
has
been
compelled
to
pay
for
mail
service
rendered
by
railroad
companies
the
exhibit
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
of
the
income
and
expenditures
by
mail
steamers
will
be
found
peculiarly
interesting
and
of
a
character
to
demand
the
immediate
action
of
congress
numerous
and
flagrant
frauds
upon
the
pension
bureau
have
been
brought
to
light
within
the
last
year
and
in
some
instances
merited
punishments
inflicted
but
unfortunately
in
others
guilty
parties
have
escaped
not
through
the
want
of
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
a
conviction
but
in
consequence
of
the
provisions
of
limitation
in
the
existing
laws
from
the
nature
of
these
claims
the
remoteness
of
the
tribunals
to
pass
upon
them
and
the
mode
in
which
the
proof
is
of
necessity
furnished
temptations
to
crime
have
been
greatly
stimulated
by
the
obvious
difficulties
of
detection
the
defects
in
the
law
upon
this
subject
are
so
apparent
and
so
fatal
to
the
ends
of
justice
that
your
early
action
relating
to
it
is
most
desirable
during
the
last
fiscal
year
acres
of
the
public
lands
have
been
surveyed
and
acres
brought
into
market
within
the
same
period
the
sales
by
public
purchase
and
private
entry
amounted
to
acres
located
under
military
bountys
and
warrants

located
under
other
certificates

ceded
to
the

as

objects

which
is
an
increase
in
quantity

and
located

warrants
and
grants
of

over
the

immediately
preceding
the
quantity
of

sold
during
the
second
and
third
quarters
of

the
amount
received
therefor
was
the
quantity

and
third

of
the

was

and
the
amount
received
therefor
the
whole
number
of

issued
under

prior
to
the

acres

have
been
issued
to

under

act
of
th
february
calling
for
acres
under
acts
of
september
and
march
calling
for
acres
making
a
total
of
acres
it
is
believed
that
experience
has
verified
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
the
present
system
with
regard
to
the
public
domain
in
most
essential
particulars
you
will
perceive
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
opinions
which
have
often
been
expressed
in
relation
to
the
operation
of
the
land
system
as
not
being
a
source
of
revenue
to
the
federal
treasury
were
erroneous
the
net
profits
from
the
sale
of
the
public
lands
to
june
amounted
to
the
sum
of
i
recommend
the
extension
of
the
land
system
over
the
territories
of
utah
and
new
mexico
with
such
modifications
as
their
peculiarities
may
require
regarding
our
public
domain
as
chiefly
valuable
to
provide
homes
for
the
industrious
and
enterprising
i
am
not
prepared
to
recommend
any
essential
change
in
the
land
system
except
by
modifications
in
favor
of
the
actual
settler
and
an
extension
of
the
preemption
principle
in
certain
cases
for
reasons
and
on
grounds
which
will
be
fully
developed
in
the
reports
to
be
laid
before
you
congress
representing
the
proprietors
of
the
territorial
domain
and
charged
especially
with
power
to
dispose
of
territory
belonging
to
the
united
states
has
for
a
long
course
of
years
beginning
with
the
administration
of
mr
jefferson
exercised
the
power
to
construct
roads
within
the
territories
and
there
are
so
many
and
obvious
distinctions
between
this
exercise
of
power
and
that
of
making
roads
within
the
states
that
the
former
has
never
been
considered
subject
to
such
objections
as
apply
to
the
latter
and
such
may
now
be
considered
the
settled
construction
of
the
power
of
the
federal
government
upon
the
subject
numerous
applications
have
been
and
no
doubt
will
continue
to
be
made
for
grants
of
land
in
aid
of
the
construction
of
railways
it
is
not
believed
to
be
within
the
intent
and
meaning
of
the
constitution
that
the
power
to
dispose
of
the
public
domain
should
be
used
otherwise
than
might
be
expected
from
a
prudent
proprietor
and
therefore
that
grants
of
land
to
aid
in
the
construction
of
roads
should
be
restricted
to
cases
where
it
would
be
for
the
interest
of
a
proprietor
under
like
circumstances
thus
to
contribute
to
the
construction
of
these
works
for
the
practical
operation
of
such
grants
thus
far
in
advancing
the
interests
of
the
states
in
which
the
works
are
located
and
at
the
same
time
the
substantial
interests
of
all
the
other
states
by
enhancing
the
value
and
promoting
the
rapid
sale
of
the
public
domain
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
a
careful
examination
however
will
show
that
this
experience
is
the
result
of
a
just
discrimination
and
will
be
far
from
affording
encouragement
to
a
reckless
or
indiscriminate
extension
of
the
principle
i
commend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
men
of
genius
of
our
country
who
by
their
inventions
and
discoveries
in
science
and
arts
have
contributed
largely
to
the
improvements
of
the
age
without
in
many
instances
securing
for
themselves
anything
like
an
adequate
reward
for
many
interesting
details
upon
this
subject
i
refer
y
ou
to
the
appropriate
reports
and
especially
urge
upon
your
early
attention
the
apparently
slight
but
really
important
modifications
of
existing
laws
therein
suggested
the
liberal
spirit
which
has
so
long
marked
the
action
of
congress
in
relation
to
the
district
of
columbia
will
i
have
no
doubt
continue
to
be
manifested
the
erection
of
an
asylum
for
the
insane
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
has
been
somewhat
retarded
by
the
great
demand
for
materials
and
labor
during
the
past
summer
but
full
preparation
for
the
reception
of
patients
before
the
return
of
another
winter
is
anticipated
and
there
is
the
best
reason
to
believe
from
the
plan
and
contemplated
arrangements
which
have
been
devised
with
the
large
experience
furnished
within
the
last
few
years
in
relation
to
the
nature
and
treatment
of
the
disease
that
it
will
prove
an
asylum
indeed
to
this
most
helpless
and
afflicted
class
of
sufferers
and
stand
as
a
noble
monument
of
wisdom
and
mercy
under
the
acts
of
congress
of
august
and
of
march
designed
to
secure
for
the
cities
of
washington
and
georgetown
an
abundant
supply
of
good
and
wholesome
water
it
became
my
duty
to
examine
the
report
and
plans
of
the
engineer
who
had
charge
of
the
surveys
under
the
act
first
named
the
best
if
not
the
only
plan
calculated
to
secure
permanently
the
object
sought
was
that
which
contemplates
taking
the
water
from
the
great
falls
of
the
potomac
and
consequently
i
gave
to
it
my
approval
for
the
progress
and
present
condition
of
this
important
work
and
for
its
demands
so
far
as
appropriations
are
concerned
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
the
present
judicial
system
of
the
united
states
has
now
been
in
operation
for
so
long
a
period
of
time
and
has
in
its
general
theory
and
much
of
its
details
become
so
familiar
to
the
country
and
acquired
so
entirely
the
public
confidence
that
if
modified
in
any
respect
it
should
only
be
in
those
particulars
which
may
adapt
it
to
the
increased
extent
population
and
legal
business
of
the
united
states
in
this
relation
the
organization
of
the
courts
is
now
confessedly
inadequate
to
the
duties
to
be
performed
by
them
in
consequence
of
which
the
states
of
florida
wisconsin
iowa
texas
and
california
and
districts
of
other
states
are
in
effect
excluded
from
the
full
benefits
of
the
general
system
by
the
functions
of
the
circuit
court
being
devolved
on
the
district
judges
in
all
those
states
or
parts
of
states
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
a
due
regard
to
justice
require
that
all
the
states
of
the
union
should
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
in
regard
to
the
judicial
tribunals
i
therefore
commend
to
your
consideration
this
important
subject
which
in
my
judgment
demands
the
speedy
action
of
congress
i
will
present
to
you
if
deemed
desirable
a
plan
which
i
am
prepared
to
recommend
for
the
enlargement
and
modification
of
the
present
judicial
system
the
act
of
congress
establishing
the
smithsonian
institution
provided
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
other
persons
therein
designated
should
constitute
an
establishment
by
that
name
and
that
the
members
should
hold
stated
and
special
meetings
for
the
supervision
of
the
affairs
of
the
institution
the
organization
not
having
taken
place
it
seemed
to
me
proper
that
it
should
be
effected
without
delay
this
has
been
done
and
an
occasion
was
thereby
presented
for
inspecting
the
condition
of
the
institution
and
appreciating
its
successful
progress
thus
far
and
its
high
promise
of
great
and
general
usefulness
i
have
omitted
to
ask
your
favorable
consideration
for
the
estimates
of
works
of
a
local
character
in
twentyseven
of
the
thirtyone
states
amounting
to
because
independently
of
the
grounds
which
have
so
often
been
urged
against
the
application
of
the
federal
revenue
for
works
of
this
character
inequality
with
consequent
injustice
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
proposition
and
because
the
plan
has
proved
entirely
inadequate
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
objects
sought
the
subject
of
internal
improvements
claiming
alike
the
interest
and
good
will
of
all
has
nevertheless
been
the
basis
of
much
political
discussion
and
has
stood
as
a
deepgraven
line
of
division
between
statesmen
of
eminent
ability
and
patriotism
the
rule
of
strict
construction
of
all
powers
delegated
by
the
states
to
the
general
government
has
arrayed
itself
from
time
to
time
against
the
rapid
progress
of
expenditures
from
the
national
treasury
on
works
of
a
local
character
within
the
states
memorable
as
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
this
subject
is
the
message
of
president
jackson
of
the
th
of
may
which
met
the
system
of
internal
improvements
in
its
comparative
infancy
but
so
rapid
had
been
its
growth
that
the
projected
appropriations
in
that
year
for
works
of
this
character
had
risen
to
the
alarming
amount
of
more
than
in
that
message
the
president
admitted
the
difficulty
of
bringing
back
the
operations
of
the
government
to
the
construction
of
the
constitution
set
up
in
and
marked
it
as
an
admonitory
proof
of
the
necessity
of
guarding
that
instrument
with
sleepless
vigilance
against
the
authority
of
precedents
which
had
not
the
sanction
of
its
most
plainly
defined
powers
our
government
exists
under
a
written
compact
between
sovereign
states
uniting
for
specific
objects
and
with
specific
grants
to
their
general
agent
if
then
in
the
progress
of
its
administration
there
have
been
departures
from
the
terms
and
intent
of
the
compact
it
is
and
will
ever
be
proper
to
refer
back
to
the
fixed
standard
which
our
fathers
left
us
and
to
make
a
stern
effort
to
conform
our
action
to
it
it
would
seem
that
the
fact
of
a
principle
having
been
resisted
from
the
first
by
many
of
the
wisest
and
most
patriotic
men
of
the
republic
and
a
policy
having
provoked
constant
strife
without
arriving
at
a
conclusion
which
can
be
regarded
as
satisfactory
to
its
most
earnest
advocates
should
suggest
the
inquiry
whether
there
may
not
be
a
plan
likely
to
be
crowned
by
happier
results
without
perceiving
any
sound
distinction
or
intending
to
assert
any
principle
as
opposed
to
improvements
needed
for
the
protection
of
internal
commerce
which
does
not
equally
apply
to
improvements
upon
the
seaboard
for
the
protection
of
foreign
commerce
i
submit
to
you
whether
it
may
not
be
safely
anticipated
that
if
the
policy
were
once
settled
against
appropriations
by
the
general
government
for
local
improvements
for
the
benefit
of
commerce
localities
requiring
expenditures
would
not
by
modes
and
means
clearly
legitimate
and
proper
raise
the
fund
necessary
for
such
constructions
as
the
safety
or
other
interests
of
their
commerce
might
require
if
that
can
be
regarded
as
a
system
which
in
the
experience
of
mere
than
thirty
years
has
at
no
time
so
commanded
the
public
judgment
as
to
give
it
the
character
of
a
settled
policy
which
though
it
has
produced
some
works
of
conceded
importance
has
been
attended
with
an
expenditure
quite
disproportionate
to
their
value
and
has
resulted
in
squandering
large
sums
upon
objects
which
have
answered
no
valuable
purpose
the
interests
of
all
the
states
require
it
to
be
abandoned
unless
hopes
may
be
indulged
for
the
future
which
find
no
warrant
in
the
past
with
an
anxious
desire
for
the
completion
of
the
works
which
are
regarded
by
all
good
citizens
with
sincere
interest
i
have
deemed
it
my
duty
to
ask
at
your
hands
a
deliberate
reconsideration
of
the
question
with
a
hope
that
animated
by
a
desire
to
promote
the
permanent
and
substantial
interests
of
the
country
your
wisdom
may
prove
equal
to
the
task
of
devising
and
maturing
a
plan
which
applied
to
this
subject
may
promise
something
better
than
constant
strife
the
suspension
of
the
powers
of
local
enterprise
the
exciting
of
vain
hopes
and
the
disappointment
of
cherished
expectations
in
expending
the
appropriations
made
by
the
last
congress
several
cases
have
arisen
in
relation
to
works
for
the
improvement
of
harbors
which
involve
questions
as
to
the
right
of
soil
and
jurisdiction
and
have
threatened
conflict
between
the
authority
of
the
state
and
general
governments
the
right
to
construct
a
breakwater
jetty
or
dam
would
seem
necessarily
to
carry
with
it
the
power
to
protect
and
preserve
such
constructions
this
can
only
be
effectually
done
by
having
jurisdiction
over
the
soil
but
no
clause
of
the
constitution
is
found
on
which
to
rest
the
claim
of
the
united
states
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
soil
of
a
state
except
that
conferred
by
the
eighth
section
of
the
first
article
of
the
constitution
it
is
then
submitted
whether
in
all
cases
where
constructions
are
to
be
erected
by
the
general
government
the
right
of
soil
should
not
first
be
obtained
and
legislative
provision
be
made
to
cover
all
such
cases
for
the
progress
made
in
the
construction
of
roads
within
the
territories
as
provided
for
in
the
appropriations
of
the
last
congress
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
there
is
one
subject
of
a
domestic
nature
which
from
its
intrinsic
importance
and
the
many
interesting
questions
of
future
policy
which
it
involves
can
not
fail
to
receive
your
early
attention
i
allude
to
the
means
of
communication
by
which
different
parts
of
the
wide
expanse
of
our
country
are
to
be
placed
in
closer
connection
for
purposes
both
of
defense
and
commercial
intercourse
and
more
especially
such
as
appertain
to
the
communication
of
those
great
divisions
of
the
union
which
lie
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
rocky
mountains
that
the
government
has
not
been
unmindful
of
this
heretofore
is
apparent
from
the
aid
it
has
afforded
through
appropriations
for
mail
facilities
and
other
purposes
but
the
general
subject
will
now
present
itself
under
aspects
more
imposing
and
more
purely
national
by
reason
of
the
surveys
ordered
by
congress
and
now
in
the
process
of
completion
for
communication
by
railway
across
the
continent
and
wholly
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
the
power
to
declare
war
to
raise
and
support
armies
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy
and
to
call
for
th
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
suppress
insurrections
and
repel
invasions
was
conferred
upon
congress
as
means
to
provide
for
the
common
defense
and
to
protect
a
territory
and
a
population
now
widespread
and
vastly
multiplied
as
incidental
to
and
indispensable
for
the
exercise
of
this
power
it
must
sometimes
be
necessary
to
construct
military
roads
and
protect
harbors
of
refuge
to
appropriations
by
congress
for
such
objects
no
sound
objection
can
be
raised
happily
for
our
country
its
peaceful
policy
and
rapidly
increasing
population
impose
upon
us
no
urgent
necessity
for
preparation
and
leave
but
few
trackless
deserts
between
assailable
points
and
a
patriotic
people
ever
ready
and
generally
able
to
protect
them
these
necessary
links
the
enterprise
and
energy
of
our
people
are
steadily
and
boldly
struggling
to
supply
all
experience
affirms
that
wherever
private
enterprise
will
avail
it
is
most
wise
for
the
general
government
to
leave
to
that
and
individual
watchfulness
the
location
and
execution
of
all
means
of
communication
the
surveys
before
alluded
to
were
designed
to
ascertain
the
most
practicable
and
economical
route
for
a
railroad
from
the
river
mississippi
to
the
pacific
ocean
parties
are
now
in
the
field
making
explorations
where
previous
examinations
had
not
supplied
sufficient
data
and
where
there
was
the
best
reason
to
hope
the
object
sought
might
be
found
the
means
and
time
being
both
limited
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
all
the
accurate
knowledge
desired
will
be
obtained
but
it
is
hoped
that
much
and
important
information
will
be
added
to
the
stock
previously
possessed
and
that
partial
if
not
full
reports
of
the
surveys
ordered
will
be
received
in
time
for
transmission
to
the
two
houses
of
congress
on
or
before
the
first
monday
in
february
next
as
required
by
the
act
of
appropriation
the
magnitude
of
the
enterprise
contemplated
has
aroused
and
will
doubtless
continue
to
excite
a
very
general
interest
throughout
the
country
in
its
political
its
commercial
and
its
military
bearings
it
has
varied
great
and
increasing
claims
to
consideration
the
heavy
expense
the
great
delay
and
at
times
fatality
attending
travel
by
either
of
the
isthmus
routes
have
demonstrated
the
advantage
which
would
result
from
interterritorial
communication
by
such
safe
and
rapid
means
as
a
railroad
would
supply
these
difficulties
which
have
been
encountered
in
a
period
of
peace
would
be
magnified
and
still
further
increased
in
time
of
war
but
whilst
the
embarrassments
already
encountered
and
others
under
new
contingencies
to
be
anticipated
may
serve
strikingly
to
exhibit
the
importance
of
such
a
work
neither
these
nor
all
considerations
combined
can
have
an
appreciable
value
when
weighed
against
the
obligation
strictly
to
adhere
to
the
constitution
and
faithfully
to
execute
the
powers
it
confers
within
this
limit
and
to
the
extent
of
the
interest
of
the
government
involved
it
would
seem
both
expedient
and
proper
if
an
economical
and
practicable
route
shall
be
found
to
aid
by
all
constitutional
means
in
the
construction
of
a
road
which
will
unite
by
speedy
transit
the
populations
of
the
pacific
and
atlantic
states
to
guard
against
misconception
it
should
be
remarked
that
although
the
power
to
construct
or
aid
in
the
construction
of
a
road
within
the
limits
of
a
territory
is
not
embarrassed
by
that
question
of
jurisdiction
which
would
arise
within
the
limits
of
a
state
it
is
nevertheless
held
to
be
of
doubtful
power
and
more
than
doubtful
propriety
even
within
the
limits
of
a
territory
for
the
general
government
to
undertake
to
administer
the
affairs
of
a
railroad
a
canal
or
other
similar
construction
and
therefore
that
its
connection
with
a
work
of
this
character
should
be
incidental
rather
than
primary
i
will
only
add
at
present
that
fully
appreciating
the
magnitude
of
the
subject
and
solicitous
that
the
atlantic
and
pacific
shores
of
the
republic
may
be
bound
together
by
inseparable
ties
of
common
interest
as
well
as
of
common
fealty
and
attachment
to
the
union
i
shall
be
disposed
so
far
as
my
own
action
is
concerned
to
follow
the
lights
of
the
constitution
as
expounded
and
illustrated
by
those
whose
opinions
and
expositions
constitute
the
standard
of
my
political
faith
in
regard
to
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
it
is
i
trust
not
necessary
to
say
that
no
grandeur
of
enterprise
and
no
present
urgent
inducement
promising
popular
favor
will
lead
me
to
disregard
those
lights
or
to
depart
from
that
path
which
experience
has
proved
to
be
safe
and
which
is
now
radiant
with
the
glow
of
prosperity
and
legitimate
constitutional
progress
we
can
afford
to
wait
but
we
can
not
afford
to
overlook
the
ark
of
our
security
it
is
no
part
of
my
purpose
to
give
prominence
to
any
subject
which
may
properly
be
regarded
as
set
at
rest
by
the
deliberate
judgment
of
the
people
but
while
the
present
is
bright
with
promise
and
the
future
full
of
demand
and
inducement
for
the
exercise
of
active
intelligence
the
past
can
never
be
without
useful
lessons
of
admonition
and
instruction
if
its
dangers
serve
not
as
beacons
they
will
evidently
fail
to
fulfill
the
object
of
a
wise
design
when
the
grave
shall
have
closed
over
all
who
are
now
endeavoring
to
meet
the
obligations
of
duty
the
year
will
be
recurred
to
as
a
period
filled
with
anxious
apprehension
a
successful
war
had
just
terminated
peace
brought
with
it
a
vast
augmentation
of
territory
disturbing
questions
arose
bearing
upon
the
domestic
institutions
of
one
portion
of
the
confederacy
and
involving
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
states
but
notwithstanding
differences
of
opinion
and
sentiment
which
then
existed
in
relation
to
details
and
specific
provisions
the
acquiescence
of
distinguished
citizens
whose
devotion
to
the
union
can
never
be
doubted
has
given
renewed
vigor
to
our
institutions
and
restored
a
sense
of
repose
and
security
to
the
public
mind
throughout
the
confederacy
that
this
repose
is
to
suffer
no
shock
during
my
official
term
if
i
have
power
to
avert
it
those
who
placed
me
here
may
be
assured
the
wisdom
of
men
who
knew
what
independence
cost
who
had
put
all
at
stake
upon
the
issue
of
the
revolutionary
struggle
disposed
of
the
subject
to
which
i
refer
in
the
only
way
consistent
with
the
union
of
these
states
and
with
the
march
of
power
and
prosperity
which
has
made
us
what
we
are
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
from
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
until
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
revolution
had
passed
to
their
graves
or
through
the
infirmities
of
age
and
wounds
had
ceased
to
participate
actively
in
public
affairs
there
was
not
merely
a
quiet
acquiescence
in
but
a
prompt
vindication
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
states
the
reserved
powers
were
scrupulously
respected
no
statesman
put
forth
the
narrow
views
of
casuists
to
justify
interference
and
agitation
but
the
spirit
of
the
compact
was
regarded
as
sacred
in
the
eye
of
honor
and
indispensable
for
the
great
experiment
of
civil
liberty
which
environed
by
inherent
difficulties
was
yet
borne
forward
in
apparent
weakness
by
a
power
superior
to
all
obstacles
there
is
no
condemnation
which
the
voice
of
freedom
will
not
pronounce
upon
us
should
we
prove
faithless
to
this
great
trust
while
men
inhabiting
different
parts
of
this
vast
continent
can
no
more
be
expected
to
hold
the
same
opinions
or
entertain
the
same
sentiments
than
every
variety
of
climate
or
soil
can
be
expected
to
furnish
the
same
agricultural
products
they
can
unite
in
a
common
object
and
sustain
common
principles
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
that
object
the
gallant
men
of
the
south
and
the
north
could
stand
together
during
the
struggle
of
the
revolution
they
could
stand
together
in
the
more
trying
period
which
succeeded
the
clangor
of
arms
as
their
united
valor
was
adequate
to
all
the
trials
of
the
camp
and
dangers
of
the
field
so
their
united
wisdom
proved
equal
to
the
greater
task
of
founding
upon
a
deep
and
broad
basis
institutions
which
it
has
been
our
privilege
to
enjoy
and
will
ever
be
our
most
sacred
duty
to
sustain
it
is
but
the
feeble
expression
of
a
faith
strong
and
universal
to
say
that
their
sons
whose
blood
mingled
so
often
upon
the
same
field
during
the
war
of
and
who
have
more
recently
borne
in
triumph
the
flag
of
the
country
upon
a
foreign
soil
will
never
permit
alienation
of
feeling
to
weaken
the
power
of
their
united
efforts
nor
internal
dissensions
to
paralyze
the
great
arm
of
freedom
uplifted
for
the
vindication
of
selfgovernment
i
have
thus
briefly
presented
such
suggestions
as
seem
to
me
especially
worthy
of
your
consideration
in
providing
for
the
present
you
can
hardly
fail
to
avail
yourselves
of
the
light
which
the
experience
of
the
past
casts
upon
the
future
the
growth
of
our
population
has
now
brought
us
in
the
destined
career
of
our
national
history
to
a
point
at
which
it
well
behooves
us
to
expand
our
vision
over
the
vast
prospective
the
successive
decennial
returns
of
the
census
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
have
revealed
a
law
of
steady
progressive
development
which
may
be
stated
in
general
terms
as
a
duplication
every
quarter
century
carried
forward
from
the
point
already
reached
for
only
a
short
period
of
time
as
applicable
to
the
existence
of
a
nation
this
law
of
progress
if
unchecked
will
bring
us
to
almost
incredible
results
a
large
allowance
for
a
diminished
proportional
effect
of
emigration
would
not
very
materially
reduce
the
estimate
while
the
increased
average
duration
of
human
life
known
to
have
already
resulted
from
the
scientific
and
hygienic
improvements
of
the
past
fifty
years
will
tend
to
keep
up
through
the
next
fifty
or
perhaps
hundred
the
same
ratio
of
growth
which
has
been
thus
revealed
in
our
past
progress
and
to
the
influence
of
these
causes
may
be
added
the
influx
of
laboring
masses
from
eastern
asia
to
the
pacific
side
of
our
possessions
together
with
the
probable
accession
of
the
populations
already
existing
in
other
parts
of
our
hemisphere
which
within
the
period
in
question
will
feel
with

yearly
increasing
force
the
natural
attraction
of
so
vast
powerful
and
prosperous
a
confederation
of
selfgoverning
republics
and
will
seek
the
privilege
of
being
admitted
within
its
safe
and
happy
bosom
transferring
with
themselves
by
a
peaceful
and
healthy
process
of
incorporation
spacious
regions
of
virgin
and
exuberant
soil
which
are
destined
to
swarm
with
the
fast
growing
and
fastspreading
millions
of
our
race
these
considerations
seem
fully
to
justify
the
presumption
that
the
law
of
population
above
stated
will
continue
to
act
with
undiminished
effect
through
at
least
the
next
half
century
and
that
thousands
of
persons
who
have
already
arrived
at
maturity
and
are
now
exercising
the
rights
of
freemen
will
close
their
eyes
on
the
spectacle
of
more
than
of
population
embraced
within
the
majestic
proportions
of
the
american
union
it
is
not
merely
as
an
interesting
topic
of
speculation
that
i
present
these
views
for
your
consideration
they
have
important
practical
bearings
upon
all
the
political
duties
we
are
called
upon
to
perform
heretofore
our
system
of
government
has
worked
on
what
may
be
termed
a
miniature
scale
in
comparison
with
the
development
which
it
must
thus
assume
within
a
future
so
near
at
hand
as
scarcely
to
be
beyond
the
present
of
the
existing
generation
it
is
evident
that
a
confederation
so
vast
and
so
varied
both
in
numbers
and
in
territorial
extent
in
habits
and
in
interests
could
only
be
kept
in
national
cohesion
by
the
strictest
fidelity
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
as
understood
by
those
who
have
adhered
to
the
most
restricted
construction
of
the
powers
granted
by
the
people
and
the
states
interpreted
and
applied
according
to
those
principles
the
great
compact
adapts
itself
with
healthy
ease
and
freedom
to
an
unlimited
extension
of
that
benign
system
of
federative
selfgovernment
of
which
it
is
our
glorious
and
i
trust
immortal
charter
let
us
then
with
redoubled
vigilance
be
on
our
guard
against
yielding
to
the
temptation
of
the
exercise
of
doubtful
powers
even
under
the
pressure
of
the
motives
of
conceded
temporary
advantage
and
apparent
temporary
expediency
the
minimum
of
federal
government
compatible
with
the
maintenance
of
national
unity
and
efficient
action
in
our
relations
with
the
rest
of
the
world
should
afford
the
rule
and
measure
of
construction
of
our
powers
under
the
general
clauses
of
the
constitution
a
spirit
of
strict
deference
to
the
sovereign
rights
and
dignity
of
every
state
rather
than
a
disposition
to
subordinate
the
states
into
a
provincial
relation
to
the
central
authority
should
characterize
all
our
exercise
of
the
respective
powers
temporarily
vested
in
us
as
a
sacred
trust
from
the
generous
confidence
of
our
constituents
in
like
manner
as
a
manifestly
indispensable
condition
of
the
perpetuation
of
the
union
and
of
the
realization
of
that
magnificent
national
future
adverted
to
does
the
duty
become
yearly
stronger
and
clearer
upon
us
as
citizens
of
the
several
states
to
cultivate
a
fraternal
and
affectionate
spirit
language
and
conduct
in
regard
to
other
states
and
in
relation
to
the
varied
interests
institutions
and
habits
of
sentiment
and
opinion
which
may
respectively
characterize
them
mutual
forbearance
respect
and
noninterference
in
our
personal
action
as
citizens
and
an
enlarged
exercise
of
the
most
liberal
principles
of
comity
in
the
public
dealings
of
state
with
state
whether
in
legislation
or
in
the
execution
of
laws
are
the
means
to
perpetuate
that
confidence
and
fraternity
the
decay
of
which
a
mere
political
union
on
so
vast
a
scale
could
not
long
survive
in
still
another
point
of
view
is
an
important
practical
duty
suggested
by
this
consideration
of
the
magnitude
of
dimensions
to
which
our
political
system
with
its
corresponding
machinery
of
government
is
so
rapidly
expanding
with
increased
vigilance
does
it
require
us
to
cultivate
the
cardinal
virtues
of
public
frugality
and
official
integrity
and
purity
public
affairs
ought
to
be
so
conducted
that
a
settled
conviction
shall
pervade
the
entire
union
that
nothing
short
of
the
highest
tone
and
standard
of
public
morality
marks
every
part
of
the
administration
and
legislation
of
the
general
government
thus
will
the
federal
system
whatever
expansion
time
and
progress
may
give
it
continue
more
and
more
deeply
rooted
in
the
love
and
confidence
of
the
people
that
wise
economy
which
is
as
far
removed
from
parsimony
as
from
corrupt
and
corrupting
extravagance
that
single
regard
for
the
public
good
which
will
frown
upon
all
attempts
to
approach
the
treasury
with
insidious
projects
of
private
interest
cloaked
under
public
pretexts
that
sound
fiscal
administration
which
in
the
legislative
department
guards
against
the
dangerous
temptations
incident
to
overflowing
revenue
and
in
the
executive
maintains
an
unsleeping
watchfulness
against
the
tendency
of
all
national
expenditure
to
extravagance
while
they
are
admitted
elementary
political
duties
may
i
trust
be
deemed
as
properly
adverted
to
and
urged
in
view
of
the
more
impressive
sense
of
that
necessity
which
is
directly
suggested
by
the
considerations
now
presented
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
the
vicepresident
of
the
united
states
has
passed
from
the
scenes
of
earth
without
having
entered
upon
the
duties
of
the
station
to
which
he
had
been
called
by
the
voice
of
his
countrymen
having
occupied
almost
continuously
for
more
than
thirty
years
a
seat
in
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
and
having
by
his
singular
purity
and
wisdom
secured
unbounded
confidence
and
universal
respect
his
failing
health
was
watched
by
the
nation
with
painful
solicitude
his
loss
to
the
country
under
all
the
circumstances
has
been
justly
regarded
as
irreparable
in
compliance
with
the
act
of
congress
of
march
the
oath
of
office
was
administered
to
him
on
the
th
of
that
month
at
ariadne
estate
near
matanzas
in
the
island
of
cuba
but
his
strength
gradually
declined
and
was
hardly
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
return
to
his
home
in
alabama
where
on
the
th
day
of
april
in
the
most
calm
and
peaceful
way
his
long
and
eminently
useful
career
was
terminated
entertaining
unlimited
confidence
in
your
intelligent
and
patriotic
devotion
to
the
public
interest
and
being
conscious
of
no
motives
on
my
part
which
are
not
inseparable
from
the
honor
and
advancement
of
my
country
i
hope
it
may
be
my
privilege
to
deserve
and
secure
not
only
your
cordial
cooperation
in
great
public
measures
but
also
those
relations
of
mutual
confidence
and
regard
which
it
is
always
so
desirable
to
cultivate
between
members
of
coordinate
branches
of
the
government

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
under
the
benignant
providence
of
almighty
god
the
representatives
of
the
states
and
of
the
people
are
again
brought
together
to
deliberate
for
the
public
good
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
to
the
sovereign
arbiter
of
all
human
events
should
be
commensurate
with
the
boundless
blessings
which
we
enjoy
peace
plenty
and
contentment
reign
throughout
our
borders
and
our
beloved
country
presents
a
sublime
moral
spectacle
to
the
world
the
troubled
and
unsettled
condition
of
some
of
the
principal
european
powers
has
had
a
necessary
tendency
to
check
and
embarrass
trade
and
to
depress
prices
throughout
all
commercial
nations
but
notwithstanding
these
causes
the
united
states
with
their
abundant
products
have
felt
their
effects
less
severely
than
any
other
country
and
all
our
great
interests
are
still
prosperous
and
successful
in
reviewing
the
great
events
of
the
past
year
and
contrasting
the
agitated
and
disturbed
state
of
other
countries
with
our
own
tranquil
and
happy
condition
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
that
we
are
the
most
favored
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
while
the
people
of
other
countries
are
struggling
to
establish
free
institutions
under
which
man
may
govern
himself
we
are
in
the
actual
enjoyment
of
thema
rich
inheritance
from
our
fathers
while
enlightened
nations
of
europe
are
convulsed
and
distracted
by
civil
war
or
intestine
strife
we
settle
all
our
political
controversies
by
the
peaceful
exercise
of
the
rights
of
freemen
at
the
ballot
box
the
great
republican
maxim
so
deeply
engraven
on
the
hearts
of
our
people
that
the
will
of
the
majority
constitutionally
expressed
shall
prevail
is
our
sure
safeguard
against
force
and
violence
it
is
a
subject
of
just
pride
that
our
fame
and
character
as
a
nation
continue
rapidly
to
advance
in
the
estimation
of
the
civilized
world
to
our
wise
and
free
institutions
it
is
to
be
attributed
that
while
other
nations
have
achieved
glory
at
the
price
of
the
suffering
distress
and
impoverishment
of
their
people
we
have
won
our
honorable
position
in
the
midst
of
an
uninterrupted
prosperity
and
of
an
increasing
individual
comfort
and
happiness
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
our
relations
with
all
nations
are
friendly
and
pacific
advantageous
treaties
of
commerce
have
been
concluded
within
the
last
four
years
with
new
granada
peru
the
two
sicilies
belgium
hanover
oldenburg
and
mecklenburgschwerin
pursuing
our
example
the
restrictive
system
of
great
britain
our
principal
foreign
customer
has
been
relaxed
a
more
liberal
commercial
policy
has
been
adopted
by
other
enlightened
nations
and
our
trade
has
been
greatly
enlarged
and
extended
our
country
stands
higher
in
the
respect
of
the
world
than
at
any
former
period
to
continue
to
occupy
this
proud
position
it
is
only
necessary
to
preserve
peace
and
faithfully
adhere
to
the
great
and
fundamental
principle
of
our
foreign
policy
of
noninterference
in
the
domestic
concerns
of
other
nations
we
recognize
in
all
nations
the
right
which
we
enjoy
ourselves
to
change
and
reform
their
political
institutions
according
to
their
own
will
and
pleasure
hence
we
do
not
look
behind
existing
governments
capable
of
maintaining
their
own
authority
we
recognize
all
such
actual
governments
not
only
from
the
dictates
of
true
policy
but
from
a
sacred
regard
for
the
independence
of
nations
while
this
is
our
settled
policy
it
does
not
follow
that
we
can
ever
be
indifferent
spectators
of
the
progress
of
liberal
principles
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
hailed
with
enthusiasm
and
delight
the
establishment
of
the
french
republic
as
we
now
hail
the
efforts
in
progress
to
unite
the
states
of
germany
in
a
confederation
similar
in
many
respects
to
our
own
federal
union
if
the
great
and
enlightened
german
states
occupying
as
they
do
a
central
and
commanding
position
in
europe
shall
succeed
in
establishing
such
a
confederated
government
securing
at
the
same
time
to
the
citizens
of
each
state
local
governments
adapted
to
the
peculiar
condition
of
each
with
unrestricted
trade
and
intercourse
with
each
other
it
will
be
an
important
era
in
the
history
of
human
events
whilst
it
will
consolidate
and
strengthen
the
power
of
germany
it
must
essentially
promote
the
cause
of
peace
commerce
civilization
and
constitutional
liberty
throughout
the
world
with
all
the
governments
on
this
continent
our
relations
it
is
believed
are
now
on
a
more
friendly
and
satisfactory
footing
than
they
have
ever
been
at
any
former
period
since
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
mexico
our
intercourse
with
the
government
of
that
republic
has
been
of
the
most
friendly
character
the
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
states
to
mexico
has
been
received
and
accredited
and
a
diplomatic
representative
from
mexico
of
similar
rank
has
been
received
and
accredited
by
this
government
the
amicable
relations
between
the
two
countries
which
had
been
suspended
have
been
happily
restored
and
are
destined
i
trust
to
be
long
preserved
the
two
republics
both
situated
on
this
continent
and
with
coterminous
territories
have
every
motive
of
sympathy
and
of
interest
to
bind
them
together
in
perpetual
amity
this
gratifying
condition
of
our
foreign
relations
renders
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
call
your
attention
more
specifically
to
them
it
has
been
my
constant
aim
and
desire
to
cultivate
peace
and
commerce
with
all
nations
tranquility
at
home
and
peaceful
relations
abroad
constitute
the
true
permanent
policy
of
our
country
war
the
scourge
of
nations
sometimes
becomes
inevitable
but
is
always
to
be
avoided
when
it
can
be
done
consistently
with
the
rights
and
honor
of
a
nation
one
of
the
most
important
results
of
the
war
into
which
we
were
recently
forced
with
a
neighboring
nation
is
the
demonstration
it
has
afforded
of
the
military
strength
of
our
country
before
the
late
war
with
mexico
european
and
other
foreign
powers
entertained
imperfect
and
erroneous
views
of
our
physical
strength
as
a
nation
and
of
our
ability
to
prosecute
war
and
especially
a
war
waged
out
of
out
own
country
they
saw
that
our
standing
army
on
the
peace
establishment
did
not
exceed
men
accustomed
themselves
to
maintain
in
peace
large
standing
armies
for
the
protection
of
thrones
against
their
own
subjects
as
well
as
against
foreign
enemies
they
had
not
conceived
that
it
was
possible
for
a
nation
without
such
an
army
well
disciplined
and
of
long
service
to
wage
war
successfully
they
held
in
low
repute
our
militia
and
were
far
from
regarding
them
as
an
effective
force
unless
it
might
be
for
temporary
defensive
operations
when
invaded
on
our
own
soil
the
events
of
the
late
war
with
mexico
have
not
only
undeceived
them
but
have
removed
erroneous
impressions
which
prevailed
to
some
extent
even
among
a
portion
of
our
own
countrymen
that
war
has
demonstrated
that
upon
the
breaking
out
of
hostilities
not
anticipated
and
for
which
no
previous
preparation
had
been
made
a
volunteer
army
of
citizen
soldiers
equal
to
veteran
troops
and
in
numbers
equal
to
any
emergency
can
in
a
short
period
be
brought
into
the
field
unlike
what
would
have
occurred
in
any
other
country
we
were
under
no
necessity
of
resorting
to
drafts
or
conscriptions
on
the
contrary
such
was
the
number
of
volunteers
who
patriotically
tendered
their
services
that
the
chief
difficulty
was
in
making
selections
and
determining
who
should
be
disappointed
and
compelled
to
remain
at
home
our
citizen
soldiers
are
unlike
those
drawn
from
the
population
of
any
other
country
they
are
composed
indiscriminately
of
all
professions
and
pursuitsof
farmers
lawyers
physicians
merchants
manufacturers
mechanics
and
laborersand
this
not
only
among
the
officers
but
the
private
soldiers
in
the
ranks
our
citizen
soldiers
are
unlike
those
of
any
other
country
in
other
respects
they
are
armed
and
have
been
accustomed
from
their
youth
up
to
handle
and
use
firearms
and
a
large
proportion
of
them
especially
in
the
western
and
more
newly
settled
states
are
expert
marksmen
they
are
men
who
have
a
reputation
to
maintain
at
home
by
their
good
conduct
in
the
field
they
are
intelligent
and
there
is
an
individuality
of
character
which
is
found
in
the
ranks
of
no
other
army
in
battle
each
private
man
as
well
as
every
officer
rights
not
only
for
his
country
but
for
glory
and
distinction
among
his
fellowcitizens
when
he
shall
return
to
civil
life
the
war
with
mexico
has
demonstrated
not
only
the
ability
of
the
government
to
organize
a
numerous
army
upon
a
sudden
call
but
also
to
provide
it
with
all
the
munitions
and
necessary
supplies
with
dispatch
convenience
and
ease
and
to
direct
its
operations
with
efficiency
the
strength
of
our
institutions
has
not
only
been
displayed
in
the
valor
and
skill
of
our
troops
engaged
in
active
service
in
the
field
but
in
the
organization
of
those
executive
branches
which
were
charged
with
the
general
direction
and
conduct
of
the
war
while
too
great
praise
can
not
be
bestowed
upon
the
officers
and
men
who
fought
our
battles
it
would
be
unjust
to
withhold
from
those
officers
necessarily
stationed
at
home
who
were
charged
with
the
duty
of
furnishing
the
army
in
proper
time
and
at
proper
places
with
all
the
munitions
of
war
and
other
supplies
so
necessary
to
make
it
efficient
the
commendation
to
which
they
are
entitled
the
credit
due
to
this
class
of
our
officers
is
the
greater
when
it
is
considered
that
no
army
in
ancient
or
modern
times
was
even
better
appointed
or
provided
than
our
army
in
mexico
operating
in
an
enemys
country
removed
miles
from
the
seat
of
the
federal
government
its
different
corps
spread
over
a
vast
extent
of
territory
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
miles
apart
from
each
other
nothing
short
of
the
untiring
vigilance
and
extraordinary
energy
of
these
officers
could
have
enabled
them
to
provide
the
army
at
all
points
and
in
proper
season
with
all
that
was
required
for
the
most
efficient
service
it
is
but
an
act
of
justice
to
declare
that
the
officers
in
c
harge
of
the
several
executive
bureaus
all
under
the
immediate
eye
and
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
war
performed
their
respective
duties
with
ability
energy
and
efficiency
they
have
reaped
less
of
the
glory
of
the
war
not
having
been
personally
exposed
to
its
perils
in
battle
than
their
companions
in
arms
but
without
their
forecast
efficient
aid
and
cooperation
those
in
the
field
would
not
have
been
provided
with
the
ample
means
they
possessed
of
achieving
for
themselves
and
their
country
the
unfading
honors
which
they
have
won
for
both
when
all
these
facts
are
considered
it
may
cease
to
be
a
matter
of
so
much
amazement
abroad
how
it
happened
that
our
noble
army
in
mexico
regulars
and
volunteers
were
victorious
upon
every
battlefield
however
fearful
the
odds
against
them
the
war
with
mexico
has
thus
fully
developed
the
capacity
of
republican
governments
to
prosecute
successfully
a
just
and
necessary
foreign
war
with
all
the
vigor
usually
attributed
to
more
arbitrary
forms
of
government
it
has
been
usual
for
writers
on
public
law
to
impute
to
republics
a
want
of
that
unity
concentration
of
purpose
and
vigor
of
execution
which
are
generally
admitted
to
belong
to
the
monarchical
and
aristocratic
forms
and
this
feature
of
popular
government
has
been
supposed
to
display
itself
more
particularly
in
the
conduct
of
a
war
carried
on
in
an
enemys
territory
the
war
with
great
britain
in
was
to
a
great
extent
confined
within
our
own
limits
and
shed
but
little
light
on
this
subject
but
the
war
which
we
have
just
closed
by
an
honorable
peace
evinces
beyond
all
doubt
that
a
popular
representative
government
is
equal
to
any
emergency
which
is
likely
to
arise
in
the
affairs
of
a
nation
the
war
with
mexico
has
developed
most
strikingly
and
conspicuously
another
feature
in
our
institutions
it
is
that
without
cost
to
the
government
or
danger
to
our
liberties
we
have
in
the
bosom
of
our
society
of
freemen
available
in
a
just
and
necessary
war
virtually
a
standing
army
of
armed
citizen
soldiers
such
as
fought
the
battles
of
mexico
but
our
military
strength
does
not
consist
alone
in
our
capacity
for
extended
and
successful
operations
on
land
the
navy
is
an
important
arm
of
the
national
defense
if
the
services
of
the
navy
were
not
so
brilliant
as
those
of
the
army
in
the
late
war
with
mexico
it
was
because
they
had
no
enemy
to
meet
on
their
own
element
while
the
army
had
opportunity
of
performing
more
conspicuous
service
the
navy
largely
participated
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
both
branches
of
the
service
performed
their
whole
duty
to
the
country
for
the
able
and
gallant
services
of
the
officers
and
men
of
the
navy
acting
independently
as
well
as
in
cooperation
with
our
troops
in
the
conquest
of
the
californias
the
capture
of
vera
cruz
and
the
seizure
and
occupation
of
other
important
positions
on
the
gulf
and
pacific
coasts
the
highest
praise
is
due
their
vigilance
energy
and
skill
rendered
the
most
effective
service
in
excluding
munitions
of
war
and
other
supplies
from
the
enemy
while
they
secured
a
safe
entrance
for
abundant
supplies
for
our
own
army
our
extended
commerce
was
nowhere
interrupted
and
for
this
immunity
from
the
evils
of
war
the
country
is
indebted
to
the
navy
high
praise
is
due
to
the
officers
of
the
several
executive
bureaus
navyyards
and
stations
connected
with
the
service
all
under
the
immediate
direction
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
the
industry
foresight
and
energy
with
which
everything
was
directed
and
furnished
to
give
efficiency
to
that
branch
of
the
service
the
same
vigilance
existed
in
directing
the
operations
of
the
navy
as
of
the
army
there
was
concert
of
action
and
of
purpose
between
the
heads
of
the
two
arms
of
the
service
by
the
orders
which
were
from
time
to
time
issued
our
vessels
of
war
on
the
pacific
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
were
stationed
in
proper
time
and
in
proper
positions
to
cooperate
efficiently
with
the
army
by
this
means
their
combined
power
was
brought
to
bear
successfully
on
the
enemy
the
great
results
which
have
been
developed
and
brought
to
light
by
this
war
will
be
of
immeasurable
importance
in
the
future
progress
of
our
country
they
will
tend
powerfully
to
preserve
us
from
foreign
collisions
and
to
enable
us
to
pursue
uninterruptedly
our
cherished
policy
of
peace
with
all
nations
entangling
alliances
with
none
occupying
as
we
do
a
more
commanding
position
among
nations
than
at
any
former
period
our
duties
and
our
responsibilities
to
ourselves
and
to
posterity
are
correspondingly
increased
this
will
be
the
more
obvious
when
we
consider
the
vast
additions
which
have
been
recently
made
to
our
territorial
possessions
and
their
great
importance
and
value
within
less
than
four
years
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
union
has
been
consummated
all
conflicting
title
to
the
oregon
territory
south
of
the
fortyninth
degree
of
north
latitude
being
all
that
was
insisted
on
by
any
of
my
predecessors
has
been
adjusted
and
new
mexico
and
upper
california
have
been
acquired
by
treaty
the
area
of
these
several
territories
according
to
a
report
carefully
prepared
by
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
from
the
most
authentic
information
in
his
possession
and
which
is
herewith
transmitted
contains
square
miles
or
acres
while
the
area
of
the
remaining
twentynine
states
and
the
territory
not
yet
organized
into
states
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
contains
square
miles
or
acres
these
estimates
show
that
the
territories
recently
acquired
and
over
which
our
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
dominion
have
been
extended
constitute
a
country
more
than
half
as
large
as
all
that
which
was
held
by
the
united
states
before
their
acquisition
if
oregon
be
excluded
from
the
estimate
there
will
still
remain
within
the
limits
of
texas
new
mexico
and
california
square
miles
or
acres
being
an
addition
equal
to
more
than
onethird
of
all
the
territory
owned
by
the
united
states
before
their
acquisition
and
including
oregon
nearly
as
great
an
extent
of
territory
as
the
whole
of
europe
russia
only
excepted
the
mississippi
so
lately
the
frontier
of
our
country
is
now
only
its
center
with
the
addition
of
the
late
acquisitions
the
united
states
are
now
estimated
to
be
nearly
as
large
as
the
whole
of
europe
it
is
estimated
by
the
superintendent
of
the
coast
survey
in
the
accompanying
report
that
the
extent
of
the
seacoast
of
texas
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
upward
of
miles
of
the
coast
of
upper
california
on
the
pacific
of
miles
and
of
oregon
including
the
straits
of
fuca
of
miles
making
the
whole
extent
of
seacoast
on
the
pacific
miles
and
the
whole
extent
on
both
the
pacific
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
miles
the
length
of
the
coast
on
the
atlantic
from
the
northern
limits
of
the
united
states
around
the
capes
of
florida
to
the
sabine
on
the
eastern
boundary
of
texas
is
estimated
to
be
miles
so
that
the
addition
of
seacoast
including
oregon
is
very
nearly
twothirds
as
great
as
all
we
possessed
before
and
excluding
oregon
is
an
addition
of
miles
being
nearly
equal
to
onehalf
of
the
extent
of
coast
which
we
possessed
before
these
acquisitions
we
have
now
three
great
maritime
frontson
the
atlantic
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
pacificmaking
in
the
whole
an
extent
of
seacoast
exceeding
miles
this
is
the
extent
of
the
seacoast
of
the
united
states
not
including
bays
sounds
and
small
irregularities
of
the
main
shore
and
of
the
sea
islands
if
these
be
included
the
length
of
the
shore
line
of
coast
as
estimated
by
the
superintendent
of
the
coast
survey
in
his
report
would
be
miles
it
would
be
difficult
to
calculate
the
value
of
these
immense
additions
to
our
territorial
possessions
texas
lying
contiguous
to
the
western
boundary
of
louisiana
embracing
within
its
limits
a
part
of
the
navigable
tributary
waters
of
the
mississippi
and
an
extensive
seacoast
could
not
long
have
remained
in
the
hands
of
a
foreign
power
without
endangering
the
peace
of
our
southwestern
frontier
her
products
in
the
vicinity
of
the
tributaries
of
the
mississippi
must
have
sought
a
market
through
these
streams
running
into
and
through
our
territory
and
the
danger
of
irritation
and
collision
of
interests
between
texas
as
a
foreign
state
and
ourselves
would
have
been
imminent
while
the
embarrassments
in
the
commercial
intercourse
between
them
must
have
been
constant
and
unavoidable
had
texas
fallen
into
the
hands
or
under
the
influence
and
control
of
a
strong
maritime
or
military
foreign
power
as
she
might
have
done
these
dangers
would
have
been
still
greater
they
have
been
avoided
by
her
voluntary
and
peaceful
annexation
to
the
united
states
texas
from
her
position
was
a
natural
and
almost
indispensable
part
of
our
territories
fortunately
she
has
been
restored
to
our
country
and
now
constitutes
one
of
the
states
of
our
confederacy
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
the
salubrity
of
climate
the
fertility
of
soil
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
production
of
some
of
our
most
valuable
staple
commodities
and
her
commercial
advantages
must
soon
make
her
one
of
our
most
populous
states
new
mexico
though
situated
in
the
interior
and
without
a
seacoast
is
known
to
contain
much
fertile
land
to
abound
in
rich
mines
of
the
precious
metals
and
to
be
capable
of
sustaining
a
large
population
from
its
position
it
is
the
intermediate
and
connecting
territory
between
our
settlements
and
our
possessions
in
texas
and
those
on
the
pacific
coast
upper
california
irrespective
of
the
vast
mineral
wealth
recently
developed
there
holds
at
this
day
in
point
of
value
and
importance
to
the
rest
of
the
union
the
same
relation
that
louisiana
did
when
that
fine
territory
was
acquired
from
france
fortyfive
years
ago
extending
nearly
ten
degrees
of
latitude
along
the
pacific
and
embracing
the
only
safe
and
commodious
harbors
on
that
coast
for
many
hundred
miles
with
a
temperate
climate
and
an
extensive
interior
of
fertile
lands
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
estimate
its
wealth
until
it
shall
be
brought
under
the
government
of
our
laws
and
its
resources
fully
developed
from
its
position
it
must
comman
d
the
rich
commerce
of
china
of
asia
of
the
islands
of
the
pacific
of
western
mexico
of
central
america
the
south
american
states
and
of
the
russian
possessions
bordering
on
that
ocean
a
great
emporium
will
doubtless
speedily
arise
on
the
californian
coast
which
may
be
destined
to
rival
in
importance
new
orleans
itself
the
depot
of
the
vast
commerce
which
must
exist
on
the
pacific
will
probably
be
at
some
point
on
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
will
occupy
the
same
relation
to
the
whole
western
coast
of
that
ocean
as
new
orleans
does
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
this
depot
our
numerous
whale
ships
will
resort
with
their
cargoes
to
trade
refit
and
obtain
supplies
this
of
itself
will
largely
contribute
to
build
up
a
city
which
would
soon
become
the
center
of
a
great
and
rapidly
increasing
commerce
situated
on
a
safe
harbor
sufficiently
capacious
for
all
the
navies
as
well
as
the
marine
of
the
world
and
convenient
to
excellent
timber
for
shipbuilding
owned
by
the
united
states
it
must
become
our
great
western
naval
depot
it
was
known
that
mines
of
the
precious
metals
existed
to
a
considerable
extent
in
california
at
the
time
of
its
acquisition
recent
discoveries
render
it
probable
that
these
mines
are
more
extensive
and
valuable
than
was
anticipated
the
accounts
of
the
abundance
of
gold
in
that
territory
are
of
such
an
extraordinary
character
as
would
scarcely
command
belief
were
they
not
corroborated
by
the
authentic
reports
of
officers
in
the
public
service
who
have
visited
the
mineral
district
and
derived
the
facts
which
they
detail
from
personal
observation
reluctant
to
credit
the
reports
in
general
circulation
as
to
the
quantity
of
gold
the
officer
commanding
our
forces
in
california
visited
the
mineral
district
in
july
last
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
accurate
information
on
the
subject
his
report
to
the
war
department
of
the
result
of
his
examination
and
the
facts
obtained
on
the
spot
is
herewith
laid
before
congress
when
he
visited
the
country
there
were
about
persons
engaged
in
collecting
gold
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
number
of
persons
so
employed
has
since
been
augmented
the
explorations
already
made
warrant
the
belief
that
the
supply
is
very
large
and
that
gold
is
found
at
various
places
in
an
extensive
district
of
country
information
received
from
officers
of
the
navy
and
other
sources
though
not
so
full
and
minute
confirms
the
accounts
of
the
commander
of
our
military
force
in
california
it
appears
also
from
these
reports
that
mines
of
quicksilver
are
found
in
the
vicinity
of
the
gold
region
one
of
them
is
now
being
worked
and
is
believed
to
be
among
the
most
productive
in
the
world
the
effects
produced
by
the
discovery
of
these
rich
mineral
deposits
and
the
success
which
has
attended
the
labors
of
those
who
have
resorted
to
them
have
produced
a
surprising
change
in
the
state
of
affairs
in
california
labor
commands
a
most
exorbitant
price
and
all
other
pursuits
but
that
of
searching
for
the
precious
metals
are
abandoned
nearly
the
whole
of
the
male
population
of
the
country
have
gone
to
the
gold
districts
ships
arriving
on
the
coast
are
deserted
by
their
crews
and
their
voyages
suspended
for
want
of
sailors
our
commanding
officer
there
entertains
apprehensions
that
soldiers
can
not
be
kept
in
the
public
service
without
a
large
increase
of
pay
desertions
in
his
command
have
become
frequent
and
he
recommends
that
those
who
shall
withstand
the
strong
temptation
and
remain
faithful
should
be
rewarded
this
abundance
of
gold
and
the
allengrossing
pursuit
of
it
have
already
caused
in
california
an
unprecedented
rise
in
the
price
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
that
we
may
the
more
speedily
and
fully
avail
ourselves
of
the
undeveloped
wealth
of
these
mines
it
is
deemed
of
vast
importance
that
a
branch
of
the
mint
of
the
united
states
be
authorized
to
be
established
at
your
present
session
in
california
among
other
signal
advantages
which
would
result
from
such
an
establishment
would
be
that
of
raising
the
gold
to
its
par
value
in
that
territory
a
branch
mint
of
the
united
states
at
the
great
commercial
depot
on
the
west
coast
would
convert
into
our
own
coin
not
only
the
gold
derived
from
our
own
rich
mines
but
also
the
bullion
and
specie
which
our
commerce
may
bring
from
the
whole
west
coast
of
central
and
south
america
the
west

the
adjacent

the
richest

of

the
bullion
and
specie
drawn
from
these
countries
and
especially
from
those
of
western
mexico
and
peru
to
an
amount
in
value
of
many
millions
of
dollars
are
now
annually
diverted
and
carried
by
the
ships
of
great
britain
to
her
own
ports
to
be
recoined
or
used
to
sustain
her
national
bank
and
thus
contribute
to
increase
her
ability
to
command
so
much
of
the
commerce
of
the
world
if
a
branch
mint
be
established
at
the
great
commercial
point
upon
that
coast
a
vast
amount
of
bullion
and
specie
would
flow
thither
to
be
recoined
and
pass
thence
to
new
orleans
new
york
and
other
atlantic
cities
the
amount
of
our
constitutional
currency
at
home
would
be
greatly
increased
while
its
circulation
abroad
would
be
promoted
it
is
well
known
to
our
merchants
trading
to
china
and
the
west
coast
of
america
that
great
inconvenience
and
loss
are
experienced
from
the
fact
that
our
coins
are
not
current
at
their
par
value
in
those
countries
the
powers
of
europe
far
removed
from
the
west
coast
of
america
by
the
atlantic
ocean
which
intervenes
and
by
a
tedious
and
dangerous
navigation
around
the
southern
cape
of
the
continent
of
america
can
never
successfully
compete
with
the
united
states
in
the
rich
and
extensive
commerce
which
is
opened
to
us
at
so
much
less
cost
by
the
acquisition
of
california
the
vast
importance
and
commercial
advantages
of
california
have
heretofore
remained
undeveloped
by
the
government
of
the
country
of
which
it
constituted
a
part
now
that
this
fine
province
is
a
part
of
our
country
all
the
states
of
the
union
some
more
immediately
and
directly
than
others
are
deeply
interested
in
the
speedy
development
of
its
wealth
and
resources
no
section
of
our
country
is
more
interested
or
will
be
more
benefited
than
the
commercial
navigating
and
manufacturing
interests
of
the
eastern
states
our
planting
and
farming
interests
in
every
part
of
the
union
will
be
greatly
benefited
by
it
as
our
commerce
and
navigation
are
enlarged
and
extended
our
exports
of
agricultural
products
and
of
manufactures
will
be
increased
and
in
the
new
markets
thus
opened
they
can
not
fail
to
command
remunerating
and
profitable
prices
the
acquisition
of
california
and
new
mexico
the
settlement
of
the
oregon
boundary
and
the
annexation
of
texas
extending
to
the
rio
grande
are
results
which
combined
are
of
greater
consequence
and
will
add
more
to
the
strength
and
wealth
of
the
nation
than
any
which
have
preceded
them
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
but
to
effect
these
great
results
not
only
california
but
new
mexico
must
be
brought
under
the
control
of
regularly
organized
governments
the
existing
condition
of
california
and
of
that
part
of
new
mexico
lying
west
of
the
rio
grande
and
without
the
limits
of
texas
imperiously
demands
that
congress
should
at
its
present
session
organize
territorial
governments
over
them
upon
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
mexico
on
the
th
of
may
last
the
temporary
governments
which
had
been
established
over
new
mexico
and
california
by
our
military
and
naval
commanders
by
virtue
of
the
rights
of
war
ceased
to
derive
any
obligatory
force
from
that
source
of
authority
and
having
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
all
government
and
control
over
them
under
the
authority
of
mexico
had
ceased
to
exist
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
establishing
territorial
governments
over
them
i
recommended
the
subject
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
in
my
message
communicating
the
ratified
treaty
of
peace
on
the
th
of
july
last
and
invoked
their
action
at
that
session
congress
adjourned
without
making
any
provision
for
their
government
the
inhabitants
by
the
transfer
of
their
country
had
become
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
our
laws
and
constitution
and
yet
were
left
without
any
regularly
organized
government
since
that
time
the
very
limited
power
possessed
by
the
executive
has
been
exercised
to
preserve
and
protect
them
from
the
inevitable
consequences
of
a
state
of
anarchy
the
only
government
which
remained
was
that
established
by
the
military
authority
during
the
war
regarding
this
to
be
a
de
facto
government
and
that
by
the
presumed
consent
of
the
inhabitants
it
might
be
continued
temporarily
they
were
advised
to
conform
and
submit
to
it
for
the
short
intervening
period
before
congress
would
again
assemble
and
could
legislate
on
the
subject
the
views
entertained
by
the
executive
on
this
point
are
contained
in
a
communication
of
the
secretary
of
state
dated
the
th
of
october
last
which
was
forwarded
for
publication
to
california
and
new
mexico
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
transmitted

small
military
force
of
the
regular
army
which
was
serving
within
the
limits
of
the
acquired
territories
at
the
close
of
the
war
was
retained
in
them
and
additional
forces
have
been
ordered
there
for
the
protection
of
the
inhabitants
and
to
preserve
and
secure
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
united
states
no
revenue
has
been
or
could

in

because
congress
failed
to
authorize
the
establishment
of
customhouses
or
the
appointment
of
officers
for

purpose
the

by

it
is
our
solemn
duty
to
provide
with
the
least
practicable
delay
for
new

and
california
regularly
organized
territorial
governments
the
causes
of
the
failure
to
do
this
at
the
last
session
of
congress
are
well
known
and
deeply
to
be
regretted
with
the
opening
prospects
of
increased
prosperity
and
national
greatness
which
the
acquisition
of
these
rich
and
extensive
territorial
possessions
affords
how
irrational
it
would
be
to
forego
or
to
reject
these
advantages
by
the
agitation
of
a
domestic
question
which
is
coeval
with
the
existence
of
our
government
itself
and
to
endanger
by
internal
strifes
geographical
divisions
and
heated
contests
for
political
power
or
for
any
other
cause
the
harmony
of
the
glorious
union
of
our
confederated
statesthat
union
which
binds
us
together
as
one
people
and
which
for
sixty
years
has
been
our
shield
and
protection
against
every
danger
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
of
posterity
how
trivial
and
insignificant
will
be
all
our
internal
divisions
and
struggles
compared
with
the
preservation
of
this
union
of
the
states
in
all
its
vigor
and
with
all
its
countless
blessings
no
patriot
would
foment
and
excite
geographical
and
sectional
divisions
no
lover
of
his
country
would
deliberately
calculate
the
value
of
the
union
future
generations
would
look
in
amazement
upon
the
folly
of
such
a
course
other
nations
at
the
present
day
would
look
upon
it
with
astonishment
and
such
of
them
as
desire
to
maintain
and
perpetuate
thrones
and
monarchical
or
aristocratical
principles
will
view
it
with
exultation
and
delight
because
in
it
they
will
see
the
elements
of
faction
which
they
hope
must
ultimately
overturn
our
system
ours
is
the
great
example
of
a
prosperous
and
free
selfgoverned
republic
commanding
the
admiration
and
the
imitation
of
all
the
lovers
of
freedom
throughout
the
world
how
solemn
therefore
is
the
duty
how
impressive
the
call
upon
us
and
upon
all
parts
of
our
country
to
cultivate
a
patriotic
spirit
of
harmony
of
goodfellowship
of
compromise
and
mutual
concession
in
the
administration
of
the
incomparable
system
of
government
formed
by
our
fathers
in
the
midst
of
almost
insuperable
difficulties
and
transmitted
to
us
with
the
injunction
that
we
should
enjoy
its
blessings
and
hand
it
down
unimpaired
to
those
who
may
come
after
us
in
view
of
the
high
and
responsible
duties
which
we
owe
to
ourselves
and
to
mankind
i
trust
you
may
be
able
at
your
present
session
to
approach
the
adjustment
of
the
only
domestic
question
which
seriously
threatens
or
probably
ever
can
threaten
to
disturb
the
harmony
and
successful
operations
of
our
system
the
immensely
valuable
possessions
of
new
mexico
and
california
are
already
inhabited
by
a
considerable
population
attracted
by
their
great
fertility
their
mineral
wealth
their
commercial
advantages
and
the
salubrity
of
the
climate
emigrants
from
the
older
states
in
great
numbers
are
already
preparing
to
seek
new
homes
in
these
inviting
regions
shall
the
dissimilarity
of
the
domestic
institutions
in
the
different
states
prevent
us
from
providing
for
them
suitable
governments
these
institutions
existed
at
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
but
the
obstacles
which
they
interposed
were
overcome
by
that
spirit
of
compromise
which
is
now
invoked
in
a
conflict
of
opinions
or
of
interests
real
or
imaginary
between
different
sections
of
our
country
neither
can
justly
demand
all
which
it
might
desire
to
obtain
each
in
the
true
spirit
of
our
institutions
should
concede
something
to
the
other
our
gallant
forces
in
the
mexican
war
by
whose
patriotism
and
unparalleled
deeds
of
arms
we
obtained
these
possessions
as
an
indemnity
for
our
just
demands
against
mexico
were
composed
of
citizens
who
belonged
to
no
one
state
or
section
of
our
union
they
were
men
from
slaveholding
and
nonslaveholding
states
from
the
north
and
the
south
from
the
east
and
the
west
they
were
all
companions
in
arms
and
fellowcitizens
of
the
same
common
country
engaged
in
the
same
common
cause
when
prosecuting
that
war
they
were
brethren
and
friends
and
shared
alike
with
each
other
common
toils
dangers
and
sufferings
now
when
their
work
is
ended
when
peace
is
restored
and
they
return
again
to
their
homes
put
off
the
habiliments
of
war
take
their
places
in
society
and
resume
their
pursuits
in
civil
life
surely
a
spirit
of
harmony
and
concession
and
of
equal
regard
for
the
rights
of
all
and
of
all
sections
of
the
union
ought
to
prevail
in
providing
governments
for
the
acquired
territoriesthe
fruits
of
their
common
service
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
and
of
every
state
contributed
to
defray
the
expenses
of
that
war
and
it
would
not
be
just
for
any
one
section
to
exclude
another
from
all
participation
in
the
acquired
territory
this
would
not
be
in
consonance
with
the
just
system
of
government
which
the
framers
of
the
constitution
adopted
the
question
is
believed
to
be
rather
abstract
than
practical
whether
slavery
ever
can
or
would
exist
in
any
portion
of
the
acquired
territory
even
if
it
were
left
to
the
option
of
the
slaveholding
states
themselves
from
the
nature
of
the
climate
and
productions
in
much
the
larger
portion
of
it
it
is
certain
it
could
never
exist
and
in
the
remainder
the
probabilities
are
it
would
not
but
however
this
may
be
the
question
involving
as
it
does
a
principle
of
equality
of
rights
of
the
separate
and
several
states
as
equal
copartners
in
the
confederacy
should
not
be
disregarded
in
organizing
governments
over
these
territories
no
duty
imposed
on
congress
by
the
constitution
requires
that
they
should
legislate
on
the
subject
of
slavery
while
their
power
to
do
so
is
not
only
seriously
questioned
but
denied
by
many
of
the
soundest
expounders
of
that
instrument
whether
congress
shall
legislate
or
not
the
people
of
the
acquired
territories
when
assembled
in
convention
to
form
state
constitutions
will
possess
the
sole
and
exclusive
power
to
determine
for
themselves
whether
slavery
shall
or
shall
not
exist
within
their
limits
if
congress
shall
abstain
from
interfering
with
the
question
the
people
of
these
territories
will
be
left
free
to
adjust
it
as
they
may
think
proper
when
they
apply
for
admission
as
states
into
the
union
no
enactment
of
congress
could
restrain
the
people
of
any
of
the
sovereign
states
of
the
union
old
or
new
north
or
south
slaveholding
or
nonslaveholding
from
determining
the
character
of
their
own
domestic
institutions
as
they
may
deem
wise
and
proper
any
and
all
the
states
possess
this
right
and
congress
can
not
deprive
them
of
it
the
people
of
georgia
might
if
they
chose
so
alter
their
constitution
as
to
abolish
slavery
within
its
limits
and
the
people
of
vermont
might
so
alter
their
constitution
as
to
admit
slavery
within
its
limits
both
states
would
possess
the
right
though
as
all
know
it
is
not
probable
that
either
would
exert
it
it
is
fortunate
for
the
peace
and
harmony
of
the
union
that
this
question
is
in
its
nature
temporary
and
can
only
continue
for
the
brief
period
which
will
intervene
before
california
and
new
mexico
may
be
admitted
as
states
into
the
union
from
the
tide
of
population
now
flowing
into
them
it
is
highly
probable
that
this
will
soon
occur
considering
the
several
states
and
the
citizens
of
the
several
states
as
equals
and
entitled
to
equal
rights
under
the
constitution
if
this
were
an
original
question
it
might
well
be
insisted
on
that
the
principle
of
noninterference
is
the
true
doctrine
and
that
congress
could
not
in
the
absence
of
any
express
grant
of
power
interfere
with
their
relative
rights
upon
a
great
emergency
however
and
under
menacing
dangers
to
the
union
the
missouri
compromise
line
in
respect
to
slavery
was
adopted
the
same
line
was
extended
farther
west
in
the
acquisition
of
texas
after
an
acquiescence
of
nearly
thirty
years
in
the
principle
of
compromise
recognized
and
established
by
these
acts
and
to
avoid
the
danger
to
the
union
which
might
follow
if
it
were
now
disregarded
i
have
heretofore
expressed
the
opinion
that
that
line
of
compromise
should
be
extended
on
the
parallel
of
from
the
western
boundary
of
texas
where
it
now
terminates
to
the
pacific
ocean
this
is
the
middle
ground
of
compromise
upon
which
the
different
sections
of
the
union
may
meet
as
they
have
heretofore
met
if
this
be
done
it
is
confidently
believed
a
large
majority
of
the
people
of
every
section
of
the
country
however
widely
their
abstract
opinions
on
the
subject
of
slavery
may
differ
would
cheerfully
and
patriotically
acquiesce
in
it
and
peace
and
harmony
would
again
fill
our
borders
the
restriction
north
of
the
line
was
only
yielded
to
in
the
case
of
missouri
and
texas
upon
a
principle
of
compromise
made
necessary
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
harmony
and
possibly
the
existence
of
the
union
it
was
upon
these
considerations
that
at
the
close
of
your
last
session
i
gave
my
sanction
to
the
principle
of
the
missouri
compromise
line
by
approving
and
signing
the
bill
to
establish
the
territorial
government
of
oregon
from
a
sincere
desire
to
preserve
the
harmony
of
the
union
and
in
deference
for
the
acts
of
my
predecessors
i
felt
constrained
to
yield
my
acquiescence
to
the
extent
to
which
they
had
gone
in
compromising
this
delicate
and
dangerous
question
but
if
congress
shall
now
reverse
the
decision
by
which
the
missouri
compromise
was
effected
and
shall
propose
to
extend
the
restriction
over
the
whole
territory
south
as
well
as
north
of
the
parallel
of
it
will
cease
to
be
a
compromise
and
must
be
regarded
as
an
original
question
if
congress
instead
of
observing
the
course
of
noninterference
lea
ving
the
adoption
of
their
own
domestic
institutions
to
the
people
who
may

if
instead
of
extending
the
missouri
compromise
line
to
the

shall
prefer
to
submit
the
legal
and
constitutional
questions
which
may
arise
to
the
decision
of
the
judicial
tribunals
as
was
proposed
in
a
bill
which
passed
the

at

session
an
adjustment
may
be
effected
in
this
mode
if
the
whole
subject
be
referred
to
the
judiciary
all
parts
of
the
union
should
cheerfully
acquiesce
in
the
final
decision
of
the
tribunal
created
by
the
constitution
for
the
settlement
of
all
questions
which
may
arise
under
the
constitution
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
congress
is
earnestly
invoked
for
the
sake
of
the
union
its
harmony
and
our
continued
prosperity
as
a
nation
to
adjust
at
its
present
session
this
the
only
dangerous
question
which
lies
in
our
path
if
not
in
some
one
of
the
modes
suggested
in
some
other
which
may
be
satisfactory
in
anticipation
of
the
establishment
of
regular
governments
over
the
acquired
territories
a
joint
commission
of
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
has
been
ordered
to
proceed
to
the
coast
of
california
and
oregon
for
the
purpose
of
making
reconnoissances
and
a
report
as
to
the
proper
sites
for
the
erection
of
fortifications
or
other
defensive
works
on
land
and
of
suitable
situations
for
naval
stations
the
information
which
may
be
expected
from
a
scientific
and
skillful
examination
of
the
whole
face
of
the
coast
will
be
eminently
useful
to
congress
when
they
come
to
consider
the
propriety
of
making
appropriations
for
these
great
national
objects
proper
defenses
on
land
will
be
necessary
for
the
security
and
protection
of
our
possessions
and
the
establishment
of
navyyards
and
a
dock
for
the
repair
and
construction
of
vessels
will
be
important
alike
to
our
navy
and
commercial
marine
without
such
establishments
every
vessel
whether
of
the
navy
or
of
the
merchant
service
requiring
repair
must
at
great
expense
come
round
cape
horn
to
one
of
our
atlantic
yards
for
that
purpose
with
such
establishments
vessels
it
is
believed
may
be
built
or
repaired
as
cheaply
in
california
as
upon
the
atlantic
coast
they
would
give
employment
to
many
of
our
enterprising
shipbuilders
and
mechanics
and
greatly
facilitate
and
enlarge
our
commerce
in
the
pacific
as
it
is
ascertained
that
mines
of
gold
silver
copper
and
quicksilver
exist
in
new
mexico
and
california
and
that
nearly
all
the
lands
where
they
are
found
belong
to
the
united
states
it
is
deemed
important
to
the
public
interest
that
provision
be
made
for
a
geological
and
mineralogical
examination
of
these
regions
measures
should
be
adopted
to
preserve
the
mineral
lands
especially
such
as
contain
the
precious
metals
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
or
if
brought
into
market
to
separate
them
from
the
farming
lands
and
dispose
of
them
in
such
manner
as
to
secure
a
large
return
of
money
to
the
treasury
and
at
the
same
time
to
lead
to
the
development
of
their
wealth
by
individual
proprietors
and
purchasers
to
do
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
provide
for
an
immediate
survey
and
location
of
the
lots
if
congress
should
deem
it
proper
to
dispose
of
the
mineral
lands
they
should
be
sold
in
small
quantities
and
at
a
fixed
minimum
price
i
recommend
that
surveyorsgenerals
offices
be
authorized
to
be
established
in
new
mexico
and
california
and
provision
made
for
surveying
and
bringing
the
public
lands
into
market
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
in
disposing
of
these
lands
i
recommend
that
the
right
of
preemption
be
secured
and
liberal
grants
made
to
the
early
emigrants
who
have
settled
or
may
settle
upon
them
it
will
be
important
to
extend
our
revenue
laws
over
these
territories
and
especially
over
california
at
an
early
period
there
is
already
a
considerable
commerce
with
california
and
until
ports
of
entry
shall
be
established
and
collectors
appointed
no
revenue
can
be
received
if
these
and
other
necessary
and
proper
measures
be
adopted
for
the
development
of
the
wealth
and
resources
of
new
mexico
and
california
and
regular
territorial
governments
be
established
over
them
such
will
probably
be
the
rapid
enlargement
of
our
commerce
and
navigation
and
such
the
addition
to
the
national
wealth
that
the
present
generation
may
live
to
witness
the
controlling
commercial
and
monetary
power
of
the
world
transferred
from
london
and
other
european
emporiums
to
the
city
of
new
york
the
apprehensions
which
were
entertained
by
some
of
our
statesmen
in
the
earlier
periods
of
the
government
that
our
system
was
incapable
of
operating
with
sufficient
energy
and
success
over
largely
extended
territorial
limits
and
that
if
this
were
attempted
it
would
fall
to
pieces
by
its
own
weakness
have
been
dissipated
by
our
experience
by
the
division
of
power
between
the
states
and
federal
government
the
latter
is
found
to
operate
with
as
much
energy
in
the
extremes
as
in
the
center
it
is
as
efficient
in
the
remotest
of
the
thirty
states
which
now
compose
the
union
as
it
was
in
the
thirteen
states
which
formed
our
constitution
indeed
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
if
our
present
population
had
been
confined
within
the
limits
of
the
original
thirteen
states
the
tendencies
to
centralization
and
consolidation
would
not
have
been
such
as
to
have
encroached
upon
the
essential
reserved
rights
of
the
states
and
thus
to
have
made
the
federal
government
a
widely
different
one
practically
from
what
it
is
in
theory
and
was
intended
to
be
by
its
framers
so
far
from
entertaining
apprehensions
of
the
safety
of
our
system
by
the
extension
of
our
territory
the
belief
is
confidently
entertained
that
each
new
state
gives
strength
and
an
additional
guaranty
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
itself
in
pursuance
of
the
provisions
of
the
thirteenth
article
of
the
treaty
of
peace
friendship
limits
and
settlement
with
the
republic
of
mexico
and
of
the
act
of
july
claims
of
our
citizens
which
had
been
already
liquidated
and
decided
against
the
mexican
republic
amounting
with
the
interest
thereon
to
have
been
liquidated
and
paid
there
remain
to
be
paid
of
these
claims
congress
at
its
last
session
having
made
no
provision
for
executing
the
fifteenth
article
of
the
treaty
by
which
the
united
states
assume
to
make
satisfaction
for
the
unliquidated
claims
of
our
citizens
against
mexico
to
an
amount
not
exceeding
three
and
a
quarter
millions
of
dollars
the
subject
is
again
recommended
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
treaty
with
mexico
took
place
on
the
th
of
may
within
one
year
after
that
time
the
commissioner
and
surveyor
which
each
government
stipulates
to
appoint
are
required
to
meet
at
the
port
of
san
diego
and
proceed
to
run
and
mark
the
said
boundary
in
its
whole
course
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
bravo
del
norte
it
will
be
seen
from
this
provision
that
the
period
within
which
a
commissioner
and
surveyor
of
the
respective
governments
are
to
meet
at
san
diego
will
expire
on
the
th
of
may
congress
at
the
close
of
its
last
session
made
an
appropriation
for
the
expenses
of
running
and
marking
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
countries
but
did
not
fix
the
amount
of
salary
which
should
be
paid
to
the
commissioner
and
surveyor
to
be
appointed
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
it
is
desirable
that
the
amount
of
compensation
which
they
shall
receive
should
be
prescribed
by
law
and
not
left
as
at
present
to
executive
discretion
measures
were
adopted
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
to
organize
the
territorial
government
of
oregon
as
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
last
the
governor
and
marshal
of
the
territory
accompanied
by
a
small
military
escort
left
the
frontier
of
missouri
in
september
last
and
took
the
southern
route
by
the
way
of
santa
fe
and
the
river
gila
to
california
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
thence
in
one
of
our
vessels
of
war
to
their
destination
the
governor
was
fully
advised
of
the
great
importance
of
his
early
arrival
in
the
country
and
it
is
confidently
believed
he
may
reach
oregon
in
the
latter
part
of
the
present
month
or
early
in
the
next
the
other
officers
for
the
territory
have
proceeded
by
sea
in
the
month
of
may
last
i
communicated
information
to
congress
that
an
indian
war
had
broken
out
in
oregon
and
recommended
that
authority
be
given
to
raise
an
adequate
number
of
volunteers
to
proceed
without
delay
to
the
assistance
of
our
fellowcitizens
in
that
territory
the
authority
to
raise
such
a
force
not
having
been
granted
by
congress
as
soon
as
their
services
could
be
dispensed
with
in
mexico
orders
were
issued
to
the
regiment
of
mounted
riflemen
to
proceed
to
jefferson
barracks
in
missouri
and
to
prepare
to
march
to
oregon
as
soon
as
the
necessary
provision
could
be
made
shortly
before
it
was
ready
to
march
it
was
arrested
by
the
provision
of
the
act
passed
by
congress
on
the
last
day
of
the
last
session
which
directed
that
all
the
noncommissioned
officers
musicians
and
privates
of
that
regiment
who
had
been
in
service
in
mexico
should
upon
their
application
be
entitled
to
be
discharged
the
effect
of
this
provision
was
to
disband
the
rank
and
file
of
the
regiment
and
before
their
places
could
be
filled
by
recruits
the
season
had
so
far
advanced
that
it
was
impracticable
for
it
to
proceed
until
the
opening
of
the
next
spring
in
the
month
of
october
last
the
accompanying
communication
was
received
from
the
governor
of
the
temporary
government
of
oregon
giving
information
of
the
continuance
of
the
indian
disturbances
and
of
the
destitution
and
defenseless
condition
of
the
inhabitants
orders
were
immediately
transmitted
to
the
commander
of
our
squadron
in
the
pacific
to
dispatch
to
their
assistance
a
part
of
the
naval
forces
on
that
station
to
furnish
them
with
arms
and
ammunition
and
to
continue
to
give
them
such
aid
and
protection
as
the
navy
could
afford
until
the
army
could
reach
the
country
it
is
the
policy
of
humanity
and
one
which
has
always
been
pursued
by
the
united
states
to
cultivate
the
good
will
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
of
t
his
continent
and
to
restrain
them
from
making
war
and
indulging
in
excesses
by
mild
means
rather
than
by
force
that
this
could
have
been
done
with
the
tribes
in
oregon
had
that
territory
been
brought
under
the
government
of
our
laws
at
an
earlier
period
and
had
other
suitable
measures
been
adopted
by
congress
such
as
now
exist
in
our
intercourse
with
the
other
indian
tribes
within
our
limits
can
not
be
doubted
indeed
the
immediate
and
only
cause
of
the
existing
hostility
of
the
indians
of
oregon
is
represented
to
have
been
the
long
delay
of
the
united
states
in
making
to
them
some
trifling
compensation
in
such
articles
as
they
wanted
for
the
country
now
occupied
by
our
emigrants
which
the
indians
claimed
and
over
which
they
formerly
roamed
this
compensation
had
been
promised
to
them
by
the
temporary
government
established
in
oregon
but
its
fulfillment
had
been
postponed
from
time
to
time
for
nearly
two
years
whilst
those
who
made
it
had
been
anxiously
waiting
for
congress
to
establish
a
territorial
government
over
the
country
the
indians
became
at
length
distrustful
of
their
good
faith
and
sought
redress
by
plunder
and
massacre
which
finally
led
to
the
present
difficulties
a
few
thousand
dollars
in
suitable
presents
as
a
compensation
for
the
country
which
had
been
taken
possession
of
by
our
citizens
would
have
satisfied
the
indians
and
have
prevented
the
war
a
small
amount
properly
distributed
it
is
confidently
believed
would
soon
restore
quiet
in
this
indian
war
our
fellowcitizens
of
oregon
have
been
compelled
to
take
the
field
in
their
own
defense
have
performed
valuable
military
services
and
been
subjected
to
expenses
which
have
fallen
heavily
upon
them
justice
demands
that
provision
should
be
made
by
congress
to
compensate
them
for
their
services
and
to
refund
to
them
the
necessary
expenses
which
they
have
incurred
i
repeat
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
to
congress
that
provision
be
made
for
the
appointment
of
a
suitable
number
of
indian
agents
to
reside
among
the
tribes
of
oregon
and
that
a
small
sum
be
appropriated
to
enable
these
agents
to
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
them
if
this
be
done
the
presence
of
a
small
military
force
will
be
all
that
is
necessary
to
keep
them
in
check
and
preserve
peace
i
recommend
that
similar
provisions
be
made
as
regards
the
tribes
inhabiting
northern
texas
new
mexico
california
and
the
extensive
region
lying
between
our
settlements
in
missouri
and
these
possessions
as
the
most
effective
means
of
preserving
peace
upon
our
borders
and
within
the
recently
acquired
territories
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
present
in
his
annual
report
a
highly
satisfactory
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
finances
the
imports
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
were
of
the
value
of
of
which
the
amount
exported
was
leaving
in
the
country
for
domestic
use
the
value
of
the
exports
for
the
same
period
was
consisting
of
domestic
productions
amounting
to
and
of
foreign
articles
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
same
period
exclusive
of
loans
amounted
to
of
which
there
was
derived
from
customs
from
sales
of
public
lands
and
from
miscellaneous
and
incidental
sources
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
revenue
from
customs
for
the
last
fiscal
year
exceeded
by
the
estimate
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
last
annual
report
and
that
the
aggregate
receipts
during
the
same
period
from
customs
lands
and
miscellaneous
sources
also
exceeded
the
estimate
by
the
sum
of
indicating
however
a
very
near
approach
in
the
estimate
to
the
actual
result
the
expenditures
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
including
those
for
the
war
and
exclusive
of
payments
of
principal
and
interest
for
the
public
debt
were
it
is
estimated
that
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
including
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
july
last
will
amount
to
the
sum
of
of
which
it
is
estimated
will
be
derived
from
customs
from
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
and
from
miscellaneous
and
incidental
sources
including
the
premium
upon
the
loan
and
the
amount
paid
and
to
be
paid
into
the
treasury
on
account
of
military
contributions
in
mexico
and
the
sales
of
arms
and
vessels
and
other
public
property
rendered
unnecessary
for
the
use
of
the
government
by
the
termination
of
the
war
and
from
loans
already
negotiated
including
treasury
notes
funded
which
together
with
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
july
last
make
the
sum
estimated
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
including
the
necessary
payment
on
account
of
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
public
debt

the
principal

interest
of
the
first
installment

th
of

next
and
other
expenditures
growing
out
of
the
war
to
be
paid
during
the
present
year
will
amount
including
the
reimbursement
of
treasury
notes
to
the
sum
of
leaving
an
estimated
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of

of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
present
as
required
by
law
the
estimate
of
the
receipts
and
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
as
estimated
for
that
year
are
including
for
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
and
for
the
principal
and
interest
due
to
mexico
on
the
th
of

leaving
the
sum
of
which
it
is
believed
will
be
ample
for
the
ordinary
peace
expenditures
the
operations
of
the
tariff
act
of
have
been
such
during
the
past
year
as
fully
to
meet
the
public
expectation
and
to
confirm
the
opinion
heretofore
expressed
of
the
wisdom
of
the
change
in
our
revenue
system
which
was
effected
by
it
the
receipts
under
it
into
the
treasury
for
the
first
fiscal
year
after
its
enactment
exceeded
by
the
sum
of
the
amount
collected
during
the
last
fiscal
year
under
the
tariff
act
of
ending
the
th
of

the
total
revenue
realized
from

commencement
of

on

th
of
september
last
being
twentytwo
months
was
being
a
much
larger
sum
than
was
ever
before
received
from
duties
during
any
equal
period
under
the
tariff
acts
of
and
whilst
by
the
repeal
of
highly
protective
and
prohibitory
duties
the
revenue
has
been
increased
the
taxes
on
the
people
have
been
diminished
they
have
been
relieved
from
the
heavy
amounts
with
which
they
were
burthened
under
former
laws
in
the
form
of
increased
prices
or
bounties
paid
to
favored
classes
and
pursuits
the
predictions
which
were
made
that
the
tariff
act
of
would
reduce
the
amount
of
revenue
below
that
collected
under
the
act
of
and
would
prostrate
the
business
and
destroy
the
prosperity
of
the
country
have
not
been
verified
with
an
increased
and
increasing
revenue
the
finances
are
in
a
highly
flourishing
condition
agriculture
commerce
and
navigation
are
prosperous
the
prices
of
manufactured
fabrics
and
of
other
products
are
much
less
injuriously
affected
than
was
to
have
been
anticipated
from
the
unprecedented
revulsions
which
during
the
last
and
the
present
year
have
overwhelmed
the
industry
and
paralyzed
the
credit
and
commerce
of
so
many
great
and
enlightened
nations
of
europe
severe
commercial
revulsions
abroad
have
always
heretofore
operated
to
depress
and
often
to
affect
disastrously
almost
every
branch
of
american
industry
the
temporary
depression
of
a
portion
of
our
manufacturing
interests
is
the
effect
of
foreign
causes
and
is
far
less
severe
than
has
prevailed
on
all
former
similar
occasions
it
is
believed
that
looking
to
the
great
aggregate
of
all
our
interests
the
whole
country
was
never
more
prosperous
than
at
the
present
period
and
never
more
rapidly
advancing
in
wealth
and
population
neither
the
foreign
war
in
which
we
have
been
involved
nor
the
loans
which
have
absorbed
so
large
a
portion
of
our
capital
nor
the
commercial
revulsion
in
great
britain
in
nor
the
paralysis
of
credit
and
commerce
throughout
europe
in
have
affected
injuriously
to
any
considerable
extent
any
of
the
great
interests
of
the
country
or
arrested
our
onward
march
to
greatness
wealth
and
power
had
the
disturbances
in
europe
not
occurred
our
commerce
would
undoubtedly
have
been
still
more
extended
and
would
have
added
still
more
to
the
national
wealth
and
public
prosperity
but
notwithstanding
these
disturbances
the
operations
of
the
revenue
system
established
by
the
tariff
act
of
have
been
so
generally
beneficial
to
the
government
and
the
business
of
the
country
that
no
change
in
its
provisions
is
demanded
by
a
wise
public
policy
and
none
is
recommended
the
operations
of
the
constitutional
treasury
established
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
in
the
receipt
custody
and
disbursement
of
the
public
money
have
continued
to
be
successful
under
this
system
the
public
finances
have
been
carried
through
a
foreign
war
involving
the
necessity
of
loans
and
extraordinary
expenditures
and
requiring
distant
transfers
and
disbursements
without
embarrassment
and
no
loss
has
occurred
of
any
of
the
public
money
deposited
under
its
provisions
whilst
it
has
proved
to
be
safe
and
useful
to
the
government
its
effects
have
been
most
beneficial
upon
the
business
of
the
country
it
has
tended
powerfully
to
secure
an
exemption
from
that
inflation
and
fluctuation
of
the
paper
currency
so
injurious
to
domestic
industry
and
rendering
so
uncertain
the
rewards
of
labor
and
it
is
believed
has
largely
contributed
to
preserve
the
whole
country
from
a
serious
commercial
revulsion
such
as
often
occurred
under
the
bank
deposit
system
in
the
year
there
was
a
revulsion
in
the
business
of
great
britain
of
great
extent
and
intensity
which
was
followed
by
failures
in
that
kingdom
unprecedented
in
number
and
amount
of
losses
this
is
believed
to
be
the
first
instance
when
such
disastrous
bankruptcies
occurring
in
a
country
with
which
we
have
such
extensive
commerce
produced
little
or
no
injurious
effect
upon
our
trade
or
currency
we
remained
but
little
affected
in
our
money
market
and
our
business
and
industry
were
still
prosperous
and
progressive
during
the
present
year
nearly
the
whole
continent
of
europe
has
been
convulsed
by
civil
wa
r
and
revolutions
attended
by
numerous
bankruptcies
by
an
unprecedented
fall
in
their
public
securities
and
an
almost
universal
paralysis
of
commerce
and
industry
and
yet
although
our
trade
and
the
prices
of
our
products
must
have
been
somewhat
unfavorably
affected
by
these
causes
we
have
escaped
a
revulsion
our
money
market
is
comparatively
easy
and
public
and
private
credit
have
advanced
and
improved
it
is
confidently
believed
that
we
have
been
saved
from
their
effect
by
the
salutary
operation
of
the
constitutional
treasury
it
is
certain
that
if
the
twentyfour
millions
of
specie
imported
into
the
country
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
had
gone
into
the
banks
as
to
a
great
extent
it
must
have
done
it
would
in
the
absence
of
this
system
have
been
made
the
basis
of
augmented
bank
paper
issues
probably
to
an
amount
not
less
than
or
producing
as
an
inevitable
consequence
of
an
inflated
currency
extravagant
prices
for
a
time
and
wild
speculation
which
must
have
been
followed
on
the
reflux
to
europe
the
succeeding
year
of
so
much
of
that
specie
by
the
prostration
of
the
business
of
the
country
the
suspension
of
the
banks
and
most
extensive
bankruptcies
occurring
as
this
would
have
done
at
a
period
when
the
country
was
engaged
in
a
foreign
war
when
considerable
loans
of
specie
were
required
for
distant
disbursements
and
when
the
banks
the
fiscal
agents
of
the
government
and
the
depositories
of
its
money
were
suspended
the
public
credit
must
have
sunk
and
many
millions
of
dollars
as
was
the
case
during
the
war
of
must
have
been
sacrificed
in
discounts
upon
loans
and
upon
the
depreciated
paper
currency
which
the
government
would
have
been
compelled
to
use
under
the
operations
of
the
constitutional
treasury
not
a
dollar
has
been
lost
by
the
depreciation
of
the
currency
the
loans
required
to
prosecute
the
war
with
mexico
were
negotiated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
above
par
realizing
a
large
premium
to
the
government
the
restraining
effect
of
the
system
upon
the
tendencies
to
excessive
paper
issues
by
banks
has
saved
the
government
from
heavy
losses
and
thousands
of
our
business
men
from
bankruptcy
and
ruin
the
wisdom
of
the
system
has
been
tested
by
the
experience
of
the
last
two
years
and
it
is
the
dictate
of
sound
policy
that
it
should
remain
undisturbed
the
modifications
in
some
of
the
details
of
this
measure
involving
none
of
its
essential
principles
heretofore
recommended
are
again
presented
for
your
favorable
consideration
in
my
message
of
the
th
of
july
last
transmitting
to
congress
the
ratified
treaty
of
peace
with
mexico
i
recommended
the
adoption
of
measures
for
the
speedy
payment
of
the
public
debt
in
reiterating
that
recommendation
i
refer
you
to
the
considerations
presented
in
that
message
in
its
support
the
public
debt
including
that
authorized
to
be
negotiated
in
pursuance
of
existing
laws
and
including
treasury
notes
amounted
at
that
time
to
funded
stock
of
the
united
states
amounting
to
about
half
a
million
of
dollars
has
been
purchased
as
authorized
by
law
since
that
period
and
the
public
debt
has
thus
been
reduced
the
details
of
which
will
be
presented
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
estimates
of
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
is
believed
will
be
ample
for
all
necessary
purposes
if
the
appropriations
made
by
congress
shall
not
exceed
the
amount
estimated
the
means
in
the
treasury
will
be
sufficient
to
defray
all
the
expenses
of
the
government
to
pay
off
the
next
installment
of
to
mexico
which
will
fall
due
on
the
th
of
may
next
and
still
a
considerable
surplus
will
remain
which
should
be
applied
to
the
further
purchase
of
the
public
stock
and
reduction
of
the
debt
should
enlarged
appropriations
be
made
the
necessary
consequence
will
be
to
postpone
the
payment
of
the
debt
though
our
debt
as
compared
with
that
of
most
other
nations
is
small
it
is
our
true
policy
and
in
harmony
with
the
genius
of
our
institutions
that
we
should
present
to
the
world
the
rare
spectacle
of
a
great
republic
possessing
vast
resources
and
wealth
wholly
exempt
from
public
indebtedness
this
would
add
still
more
to
our
strength
and
give
to
us
a
still
more
commanding
position
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
the
public
expenditures
should
be
economical
and
be
confined
to
such
necessary
objects
as
are
clearly
within
the
powers
of
congress
all
such
as
are
not
absolutely
demanded
should
be
postponed
and
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
should
be
a
cardinal
principle
of
our
public
policy
for
the
reason
assigned
in
my
last
annual
message
i
repeat
the
recommendation
that
a
branch
of
the
mint
of
the
united
states
be
established
at
the
city
of
new
york
the
importance
of
this
measure
is
greatly
increased
by
the
acquisition
of
the
rich
mines
of
the
precious
metals
in
new
mexico
and
california
and
especially
in
the
latter
i
repeat
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
in
favor
of
the
graduation
and
reduction
of
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
have
been
long
offered
in
the
market
and
have
remained
unsold
and
in
favor
of
extending
the
rights
of
preemption
to
actual
settlers
on
the
unsurveyed
as
well
as
the
surveyed
lands
the
condition
and
operations
of
the
army
and
the
state
of
other
branches
of
the
public
service
under
the
supervision
of
the
war
department
are
satisfactorily
presented
in
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
on
the
return
of
peace
our
forces
were
withdrawn
from
mexico
and
the
volunteers
and
that
portion
of
the
regular
army
engaged
for
the
war
were
disbanded
orders
have
been
issued
for
stationing
the
forces
of
our
permanent
establishment
at
various
positions
in
our
extended
country
where
troops
may
be
required
owing
to
the
remoteness
of
some
of
these
positions
the
detachments
have
not
yet
reached
their
destination
notwithstanding
the
extension
of
the
limits
of
our
country
and
the
forces
required
in
the
new
territories
it
is
confidently
believed
that
our
present
military
establishment
is
sufficient
for
all
exigencies
so
long
as
our
peaceful
relations
remain
undisturbed
of
the
amount
of
military
contributions
collected
in
mexico
the
sum
of
was
applied
toward
the
payment
of
the
first
installment
due
under
the
treaty
with
mexico
the
further
sum
of
has
been
paid
into
the
treasury
and
unexpended
balances
still
remain
in
the
hands
of
disbursing
officers
and
those
who
were
engaged
in
the
collection
of
these
moneys
after
the
proclamation
of
peace
no
further
disbursements
were
made
of
any
unexpended
moneys
arising
from
this
source
the
balances
on
hand
were
directed
to
be
paid
into
the
treasury
and
individual
claims
on
the
fund
will
remain
unadjusted
until
congress
shall
authorize
their
settlement
and
payment
these
claims
are
not
considerable
in
number
or
amount
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
suggestions
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
regard
to
legislation
on
this
subject
our
indian
relations
are
presented
in
a
most
favorable
view
in
the
report
from
the
war
department
the
wisdom
of
our
policy
in
regard
to
the
tribes
within
our
limits
is
clearly
manifested
by
their
improved
and
rapidly
improving
condition
a
most
important
treaty
with
the
menomonies
has
been
recently
negotiated
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
person
by
which
all
their
land
in
the
state
of
wisconsinbeing
about
acreshas
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
this
treaty
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
ratification
at
an
early
period
of
your
present
session
within
the
last
four
years
eight
important
treaties
have
been
negotiated
with
different
indian
tribes
and
at
a
cost
of
indian
lands
to
the
amount
of
more
than
acres
have
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
and
provision
has
been
made
for
settling
in
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
the
tribes
which
occupied
this
large
extent
of
the
public
domain
the
title
to
all
the
indian
lands
within
the
several
states
of
our
union
with
the
exception
of
a
few
small
reservations
is
now
extinguished
and
a
vast
region
opened
for
settlement
and
cultivation
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
gives
a
satisfactory
exhibit
of
the
operations
and
condition
of
that
branch
of
the
public
service
a
number
of
small
vessels
suitable
for
entering
the
mouths
of
rivers
were
judiciously
purchased
during
the
war
and
gave
great
efficiency
to
the
squadron
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
the
return
of
peace
when
no
longer
valuable
for
naval
purposes
and
liable
to
constant
deterioration
they
were
sold
and
the
money
placed
in
the
treasury
the
number
of
men
in
the
naval
service
authorized
by
law
during
the
war
has
been
reduced
by
discharges
below
the
maximum
fixed
for
the
peace
establishment
adequate
squadrons
are
maintained
in
the
several
quarters
of
the
globe
where
experience
has
shown
their
services
may
be
most
usefully
employed
and
the
naval
service
was
never
in
a
condition
of
higher
discipline
or
greater
efficiency
i
invite
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
on
the
subject
of
the
marine
corps
the
reduction
of
the
corps
at
the
end
of
the
war
required
that
four
officers
of
each
of
the
three
lower
grades
should
be
dropped
from
the
rolls
a
board
of
officers
made
the
selection
and
those
designated
were
necessarily
dismissed
but
without
any
alleged
fault
i
concur
in
opinion
with
the
secretary
that
the
service
would
be
improved
by
reducing
the
number
of
landsmen
and
increasing
the
marines
such
a
measure
would
justify
an
increase
of
the
number
of
officers
to
the
extent
of
the
reduction
by
dismissal
and
still
the
corps
would
have
fewer
officers
than
a
corresponding
number
of
men
in
the
army
the
contracts
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
in
steamships
convertible
into
war
steamers
promise
to
realize
all
the
benefits
to
our
commerce
and
to
the
navy
which
were
anticipated
the
first
steamer
thus
secured
to
the
government
was
launched
in
january
there
are
now
seven
and
in
another
year
there
will
probably
be
not
less
than
seventeen
afloat
w
hile
this
great
national
advantage
is
secured
our
social
and
commercial
intercourse
is
increased
and
promoted
with
germany
great
britain
and
other
parts
of
europe
with
all
the
countries
on
the
west
coast
of
our
continent
especially
with
oregon
and
california
and
between
the
northern
and
southern
sections
of
the
united
states
considerable
revenue
may
be
expected
from
postages
but
the
connected
line
from
new
york
to
chagres
and
thence
across
the
isthmus
to
oregon
can
not
fail
to
exert
a
beneficial
influence
not
now
to
be
estimated
on
the
interests
of
the
manufactures
commerce
navigation
and
currency
of
the
united
states
as
an
important
part
of
the
system
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
establishment
of
the
proposed
line
of
steamers
between
new
orleans
and
vera
cruz
it
promises
the
most
happy
results
in
cementing
friendship
between
the
two
republics
and
extending
reciprocal
benefits
to
the
trade
and
manufactures
of
both
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
will
make
known
to
you
the
operations
of
that
department
for
the
past
year
it
is
gratifying
to
find
the
revenues
of
the
department
under
the
rates
of
postage
now
established
by
law
so
rapidly
increasing
the
gross
amount
of
postages
during
the
last
fiscal
year
amounted
to
exceeding
the
annual
average
received
for
the
nine
years
immediately
preceding
the
passage
of
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
by
the
sum
of
and
exceeding
the
amount
received
for
the
year
ending
the
th
of

by
the
sum
of
the
expenditures
for
the
year
excluding
the
sum
of
allowed
by
congress
at
its
last
session
to
individual
claimants
and
including
the
sum
of
paid
for
the
services
of
the
line
of
steamers
between
bremen
and
new
york
amounted
to
which
is
less
than
the
annual

the
nine

of

itself
a

cheappostage
system
is
the
best
means
of
diffusing
intelligence
among
the
people
and
is
of
so
much
importance
in
a
country
so
extensive
as
that
of
the
united
states
that
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
for
its
improvement
nothing
can
retard
the
onward
progress
of
our
country
and
prevent
us
from
assuming
and
maintaining
the
first
rank
among
nations
but
a
disregard
of
the
experience
of
the
past
and
a
recurrence
to
an
unwise
public
policy
we
have
just
closed
a
foreign
war
by
an
honorable
peacea
war
rendered
necessary
and
unavoidable
in
vindication
of
the
national
rights
and
honor
the
present
condition
of
the
country
is
similar
in
some
respects
to
that
which
existed
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
war
with
great
britain
in
and
the
occasion
is
deemed
to
be
a
proper
one
to
take
a
retrospect
of
the
measures
of
public
policy
which
followed
that
war
there
was
at
that
period
of
our
history
a
departure
from
our
earlier
policy
the
enlargement
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
by
construction
which
obtained
was
not
warranted
by
any
just
interpretation
of
the
constitution
a
few
years
after
the
close
of
that
war
a
series
of
measures
was
adopted
which
united
and
combined
constituted
what
was
termed
by
their
authors
and
advocates
the
american
system
the
introduction
of
the
new
policy
was
for
a
time
favored
by
the
condition
of
the
country
by
the
heavy
debt
which
had
been
contracted
during
the
war
by
the
depression
of
the
public
credit
by
the
deranged
state
of
the
finances
and
the
currency
and
by
the
commercial
and
pecuniary
embarrassment
which
extensively
prevailed
these
were
not
the
only
causes
which
led
to
its
establishment
the
events
of
the
war
with
great
britain
and
the
embarrassments
which
had
attended
its
prosecution
had
left
on
the
minds
of
many
of
our
statesmen
the
impression
that
our
government
was
not
strong
enough
and
that
to
wield
its
resources
successfully
in
great
emergencies
and
especially
in
war
more
power
should
be
concentrated
in
its
hands
this
increased
power
they
did
not
seek
to
obtain
by
the
legitimate
and
prescribed
modean
amendment
of
the
constitutionbut
by
construction
they
saw
governments
in
the
old
world
based
upon
different
orders
of
society
and
so
constituted
as
to
throw
the
whole
power
of
nations
into
the
hands
of
a
few
who
taxed
and
controlled
the
many
without
responsibility
or
restraint
in
that
arrangement
they
conceived
the
strength
of
nations
in
war
consisted
there
was
also
something
fascinating
in
the
ease
luxury
and
display
of
the
higher
orders
who
drew
their
wealth
from
the
toil
of
the
laboring
millions
the
authors
of
the
system
drew
their
ideas
of
political
economy
from
what
they
had
witnessed
in
europe
and
particularly
in
great
britain
they
had
viewed
the
enormous
wealth
concentrated
in
few
hands
and
had
seen
the
splendor
of
the
overgrown
establishments
of
an
aristocracy
which
was
upheld
by
the
restrictive
policy
they
forgot
to
look
down
upon
the
poorer
classes
of
the
english
population
upon
whose
daily
and
yearly
labor
the
great
establishments
they
so
much
admired
were
sustained
and
supported
they
failed
to
perceive
that
the
scantily
fed
and
halfclad
operatives
were
not
only
in
abject
poverty
but
were
bound
in
chains
of
oppressive
servitude
for
the
benefit
of
favored
classes
who
were
the
exclusive
objects
of
the
care
of
the
government
it
was
not
possible
to
reconstruct
society
in
the
united
states
upon
the
european
plan
here
there
was
a
written
constitution
by
which
orders
and
titles
were
not
recognized
or
tolerated
a
system
of
measures
was
therefore
devised
calculated
if
not
intended
to
withdraw
power
gradually
and
silently
from
the
states
and
the
mass
of
the
people
and
by
construction
to
approximate
our
government
to
the
european
models
substituting
an
aristocracy
of
wealth
for
that
of
orders
and
titles
without
reflecting
upon
the
dissimilarity
of
our
institutions
and
of
the
condition
of
our
people
and
those
of
europe
they
conceived
the
vain
idea
of
building
up
in
the
united
states
a
system
similar
to
that
which
they
admired
abroad
great
britain
had
a
national
bank
of
large
capital
in
whose
hands
was
concentrated
the
controlling
monetary
and
financial
power
of
the
nationan
institution
wielding
almost
kingly
power
and
exerting
vast
influence
upon
all
the
operations
of
trade
and
upon
the
policy
of
the
government
itself
great
britain
had
an
enormous
public
debt
and
it
had
become
a
part
of
her
public
policy
to
regard
this
as
a
public
blessing
great
britain
had
also
a
restrictive
policy
which
placed
fetters
and
burdens
on
trade
and
trammeled
the
productive
industry
of
the
mass
of
the
nation
by
her
combined
system
of
policy
the
landlords
and
other
property
holders
were
protected
and
enriched
by
the
enormous
taxes
which
were
levied
upon
the
labor
of
the
country
for
their
advantage
imitating
this
foreign
policy
the
first
step
in
establishing
the
new
system
in
the
united
states
was
the
creation
of
a
national
bank
not
foreseeing
the
dangerous
power
and
countless
evils
which
such
an
institution
might
entail
on
the
country
nor
perceiving
the
connection
which
it
was
designed
to
form
between
the
bank
and
the
other
branches
of
the
miscalled
american
system
but
feeling
the
embarrassments
of
the
treasury
and
of
the
business
of
the
country
consequent
upon
the
war
some
of
our
statesmen
who
had
held
different
and
sounder
views
were
induced
to
yield
their
scruples
and
indeed
settled
convictions
of
its
unconstitutionality
and
to
give
it
their
sanction
as
an
expedient
which
they
vainly
hoped
might
produce
relief
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
error
as
the
subsequent
history
and
final
catastrophe
of
that
dangerous
and
corrupt
institution
have
abundantly
proved
the
bank
with
its
numerous
branches
ramified
into
the
states
soon
brought
many
of
the
active
political
and
commercial
men
in
different
sections
of
the
country
into
the
relation
of
debtors
to
it
and
dependents
upon
it
for
pecuniary
favors
thus
diffusing
throughout
the
mass
of
society
a
great
number
of
individuals
of
power
and
influence
to
give
tone
to
public
opinion
and
to
act
in
concert
in
cases
of
emergency
the
corrupt
power
of
such
a
political
engine
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
speculation
having
been
displayed
in
numerous
instances
but
most
signally
in
the
political
struggles
of
and
in
oppos
ition
to
the
public
will
represented
by
a
fearless
and
patriotic
president
but
the
bank
was
but
one
branch
of
the
new
system
a
public
debt
of
more
than
existed
and
it
is
not
to
be
disguised
that
many
of
the
authors
of
the
new
system
did
not
regard
its
speedy
payment
as
essential
to
the
public
prosperity
but
looked
upon
its
continuance
as
no
national
evil
whilst
the
debt
existed
it
furnished
aliment
to
the
national
bank
and
rendered
increased
taxation
necessary
to
the
amount
of
the
interest
exceeding
annually
this
operated
in
harmony
with
the
next
branch
of
the
new
system
which
was
a
high
protective
tariff
this
was
to
afford
bounties
to
favored
classes
and
particular
pursuits
at
the
expense
of
all
others
a
proposition
to
tax
the
whole
people
for
the
purpose
of
enriching
a
few
was
too
monstrous
to
be
openly
made
the
scheme
was
therefore
veiled
under
the
plausible
but
delusive
pretext
of
a
measure
to
protect
home
industry
and
many
of
our
people
were
for
a
time
led
to
believe
that
a
tax
which
in
the
main
fell
upon
labor
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
laborer
who
paid
it
this
branch
of
the
system
involved
a
partnership
between
the
government
and
the
favored
classes
the
former
receiving
the
proceeds
of
the
tax
imposed
on
articles
imported
and
the
latter
the
increased
price
of
similar
articles
produced
at
home
caused
by
such
tax
it
is
obvious
that
the
portion
to
be
received
by
the
favored
classes
would
as
a
general
rule
be
increased
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
the
rates
of
tax
imposed
and
diminished
as
those
rates
were
reduced
to
the
revenue
standard
required
by
the
wants
of
the
government
the
rates
required
to
produce
a
sufficient
revenue
for
the
ordinary
expenditures
of
government
for
necessary
purposes
were
not
likely
to
give
to
the
private
partners
in
this
scheme
profits
sufficient
to
satisfy
their
cupidity
and
hence
a
variety
of
expedients
and
pretexts
were
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
enlarging
the
expenditures
and
thereby
creating
a
necessity
for
keeping
up
a
high
protective
tariff
the
effect
of
this
policy
was
to
interpose
artificial
restrictions
upon
the
natural
course
of
the
business
and
trade
of
the
country
and
to
advance
the
interests
of
large
capitalists
and
monopolists
at
the
expense
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
who
were
taxed
to
increase
their
wealth
another
branch
of
this
system
was
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
internal
improvements
capable
of
indefinite
enlargement
and
sufficient
to
swallow
up
as
many
millions
annually
as
could
be
exacted
from
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
country
this
was
a
convenient
and
necessary
adjunct
of
the
protective
tariff
it
was
to
be
the
great
absorbent
of
any
surplus
which
might
at
any
time
accumulate
in
the
treasury
and
of
the
taxes
levied
on
the
people
not
for
necessary
revenue
purposes
but
for
the
avowed
object
of
affording
protection
to
the
favored
classes
auxiliary
to
the
same
end
if
it
was
not
an
essential
part
of
the
system
itself
was
the
scheme
which
at
a
later
period
obtained
for
distributing
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
among
the
states
other
expedients
were
devised
to
take
money
out
of
the
treasury
and
prevent
its
coming
in
from
any
other
source
than
the
protective
tariff
the
authors
and
supporters
of
the
system
were
the
advocates
of
the
largest
expenditures
whether
for
necessary
or
useful
purposes
or
not
because
the
larger
the
expenditures
the
greater
was
the
pretext
for
high
taxes
in
the
form
of
protective
duties
these
several
measures
were
sustained
by
popular
names
and
plausible
arguments
by
which
thousands
were
deluded
the
bank
was
represented
to
be
an
indispensable
fiscal
agent
for
the
government
was
to
equalize
exchanges
and
to
regulate
and
furnish
a
sound
currency
always
and
everywhere
of
uniform
value
the
protective
tariff
was
to
give
employment
to
american
labor
at
advanced
prices
was
to
protect
home
industry
and
furnish
a
steady
market
for
the
farmer
internal
improvements
were
to
bring
trade
into
every
neighborhood
and
enhance
the
value
of
every
mans
property
the
distribution
of
the
land
money
was
to
enrich
the
states
finish
their
public
works
plant
schools
throughout
their
borders
and
relieve
them
from
taxation
but
the
fact
that
for
every
dollar
taken
out
of
the
treasury
for
these
objects
a
much
larger
sum
was
transferred
from
the
pockets
of
the
people
to
the
favored
classes
was
carefully
concealed
as
was
also
the
tendency
if
not
the
ultimate
design
of
the
system
to
build
up
an
aristocracy
of
wealth
to
control
the
masses
of
society
and
monopolize
the
political
power
of
the
country
the
several
branches
of
this
system
were
so
intimately
blended
together
that
in
their
operation
each
sustained
and
strengthened
the
others
their
joint
operation
was
to
add
new
burthens
of
taxation
and
to
encourage
a
largely
increased
and
wasteful
expenditure
of
public
money
it
was
the
interest
of
the
bank
that
the
revenue
collected
and
the
disbursements
made
by
the
government
should
be
large
because
being
the
depository
of
the
public
money
the
larger
the
amount
the
greater
would
be
the
bank
profits
by
its
use
it
was
the
interest
of
the
favored
classes
who
were
enriched
by
the
protective
tariff
to
have
the
rates
of
that
protection
as
high
as
possible
for
the
higher
those
rates
the
greater
would
be
their
advantage
it
was
the
interest
of
the
people
of
all
those
sections
and
localities
who
expected
to
be
benefited
by
expenditures
for
internal
improvements
that
the
amount
collected
should
be
as
large
as
possible
to
the
end
that
the
sum
disbursed
might
also
be
the
larger
the
states
being
the
beneficiaries
in
the
distribution
of
the
land
money
had
an
interest
in
having
the
rates
of
tax
imposed
by
the
protective
tariff
large
enough
to
yield
a
sufficient
revenue
from
that
source
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
government
without
disturbing
or
taking
from
them
the
land
fund
so
that
each
of
the
branches
constituting
the
system
had
a
common
interest
in
swelling
the
public
expenditures
they
had
a
direct
interest
in
maintaining
the
public
debt
unpaid
and
increasing
its
amount
because
this
would
produce
an
annual
increased
drain
upon
the
treasury
to
the
amount
of
the
interest
and
render
augmented
taxes
necessary
the
operation
and
necessary
effect
of
the
whole
system
were
to
encourage
large
and
extravagant
expenditures
and
thereby
to
increase
the
public
patronage
and
maintain
a
rich
and
splendid
government
at
the
expense
of
a
taxed
and
impoverished
people
it
is
manifest
that
this
scheme
of
enlarged
taxation
and
expenditures
had
it
continued
to
prevail
must
soon
have
converted
the
government
of
the
union
intended
by
its
framers
to
be
a
plain
cheap
and
simple
confederation
of
states
united
together
for
common
protection
and
charged
with
a
few
specific
duties
relating
chiefly
to
our
foreign
affairs
into
a
consolidated
empire
depriving
the
states
of
their
reserved
rights
and
the
people
of
their
just
power
and
control
in
the
administration
of
their
government
in
this
manner
the
whole
form
and
character
of
the
government
would
be
changed
not
by
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
but
by
resorting
to
an
unwarrantable
and
unauthorized
construction
of
that
instrument
the
indirect
mode
of
levying
the
taxes
by
a
duty
on
imports
prevents
the
mass
of
the
people
from
readily
perceiving
the
amount
they
pay
and
has
enabled
the
few
who
are
thus
enriched
and
who
seek
to
wield
the
political
power
of
the
country
to
deceive
and
delude
them
were
the
taxes
collected
by
a
direct
levy
upon
the
people
as
is
the
case
in
the
states
this
could
not
occur
the
whole
system
was
resisted
from
its
inception
by
many
of
our
ablest
statesmen
some
of
whom
doubted
its
constitutionality
and
its
expediency
while
others
believed
it
was
in
all
its
branches
a
flagrant
and
dangerous
infraction
of
the
constitution
that
a
national
bank
a
protective
tarifflevied
not
to
raise
the
revenue
needed
but
for
protection
merelyinternal
improvements
and
the
distribution
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
public
lands
are
measures
without
the
warrant
of
the
constitution
would
upon
the
maturest
consideration
seem
to
be
clear
it
is
remarkable
that
no
one
of
these
measures
involving
such
momentous
consequences
is
authorized
by
any
express
grant
of
power
in
the
constitution
no
one
of
them
is
incident
to
as
being
necessary
and
proper
for
the
execution
of
the
specific
powers
granted
by
the
constitution
the
authority
under
which
it
has
been
attempted
to
justify
each
of
them
is
derived
from
inferences
and
constructions
of
the
constitution
which
its
letter
and
its
whole
object
and
design
do
not
warrant
is
it
to
be
conceived
that
such
immense
powers
would
have
been
left
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
mere
inferences
and
doubtful
constructions
had
it
been
intended
to
confer
them
on
the
federal
government
it
is
but
reasonable
to
conclude
that
it
would
have
been
done
by
plain
and
unequivocal
grants
this
was
not
done
but
the
whole
structure
of
which
the
american
system
consisted
was
reared
on
no
other
or
better
foundation
than
forced
implications
and
inferences
of
power
which
its
authors
assumed
might
be
deduced
by
construction
from
the
constitution
but
it
has
been
urged
that
the
national
bank
which
constituted
so
essential
a
branch
of
this
combined
system
of
measures
was
not
a
new
measure
and
that
its
constitutionality
had
been
previously
sanctioned
because
a
bank
had
been
chartered
in
and
had
received
the
official
signature
of
president
washington
a
few
facts
will
show
the
just
weight
to
which
this
precedent
should
be
entitled
as
bearing
upon
the
question
of
constitutionality
great
division
of
opinion
upon
the
subject
existed
in
congress
it
is
well
known
that
president
washington
entertained
serious
doubts
both
as
to
the
constitutionality
and
expediency
of
the
measure
and
while
the
bill
was
before
him
for
his
official
approval
or
disapproval
so
great
were
these
doubts
that
he
required
the
opinion
in
writing
of
the
members
of
his
cabinet
to
aid
him
in
arriving
at
a
decision
his
cabinet
gave
their
opinions
and
were
divided
upon
the
subject
gene
ral
hamilton
being
in
favor
of
and
mr
jefferson
and
mr
randolph
being
opposed
to
the
constitutionality
and
expediency
of
the
bank
it
is
well
known
also
that
president
washington
retained
the
bill
from
monday
the
th
when
it
was
presented
to
him
until
friday
the
th
of
february
being
the
last
moment
permitted
him
by
the
constitution
to
deliberate
when
he
finally
yielded
to
it
his
reluctant
assent
and
gave
it
his
signature
it
is
certain
that
as
late
as
the
d
of
february
being
the
ninth
day
after
the
bill
was
presented
to
him
he
had
arrived
at
no
satisfactory
conclusion
for
on
that
day
he
addressed
a
note
to
general
hamilton
in
which
he
informs
him
that
this
bill
was
presented
to
me
by
the
joint
committee
of
congress
at
oclock
on
monday
the
th
instant
and
he
requested
his
opinion
to
what
precise
period
by
legal
interpretation
of
the
constitution
can
the
president
retain
it
in
his
possession
before
it
becomes
a
law
by
the
lapse
of
ten
days
if
the
proper
construction
was
that
the
day
on
which
the
bill
was
presented
to
the
president
and
the
day
on
which
his
action
was
had
upon
it
were
both
to
be
counted
inclusive
then
the
time
allowed
him
within
which
it
would
be
competent
for
him
to
return
it
to
the
house
in
which
it
originated
with
his
objections
would
expire
on
thursday
the
th
of
february
general
hamilton
on
the
same
day
returned
an
answer
in
which
he
states
i
give
it
as
my
opinion
that
you
have
ten
days
exclusive
of
that
on
which
the
bill
was
delivered
to
you
and
sundays
hence
in
the
present
case
if
it
is
returned
on
friday
it
will
be
in
time
by
this
construction
which
the
president
adopted
he
gained
another
day
for
deliberation
and
it
was
not
until
the
th
of
february
that
he
signed
the
bill
thus
affording
conclusive
proof
that
he
had
at
last
obtained
his
own
consent
to
sign
it
not
without
great
and
almost
insuperable
difficulty
additional
light
has
been
recently
shed
upon
the
serious
doubts
which
he
had
on
the
subject
amounting
at
one
time
to
a
conviction
that
it
was
his
duty
to
withhold
his
approval
from
the
bill
this
is
found
among
the
manuscript
papers
of
mr
madison
authorized
to
be
purchased
for
the
use
of
the
government
by
an
act
of
the
last
session
of
congress
and
now
for
the
first
time
accessible
to
the
public
from
these
papers
it
appears
that
president
washington
while
he
yet
held
the
bank
bill
in
his
hands
actually
requested
mr
madison
at
that
time
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
prepare
the
draft
of
a
veto
message
for
him
mr
madison
at
his
request
did
prepare
the
draft
of
such
a
message
and
sent
it
to
him
on
the
st
of
february
a
copy
of
this
original
draft
in
mr
madisons
own
handwriting
was
carefully
preserved
by
him
and
is
among
the
papers
lately
purchased
by
congress
it
is
preceded
by
a
note
written
on
the
same
sheet
which
is
also
in
mr
madisons
handwriting
and
is
as
follows
february
copy
of
a
paper
made
out
and
sent
to
the
president
at
his
request
to
be
ready
in
case
his
judgment
should
finally
decide
against
the
bill
for
incorporating
a
national
bank
the
bill
being
then
before
him
among
the
objections
assigned
in
this
paper
to
the
bill
and
which
were
submitted
for
the
consideration
of
the
president
are
the
following
i
object
to
the
bill
because
it
is
an
essential
principle
of
the
government
that
powers
not
delegated
by
the
constitution
can
not
be
rightfully
exercised
because
the
power
proposed
by
the
bill
to
be
exercised
is
not
expressly
delegated
and
because
i
can
not
satisfy
myself
that
it
results
from
any
express
power
by
fair
and
safe
rules
of
interpretation
the
weight
of
the
precedent
of
the
bank
of
and
the
sanction
of
the
great
name
of
washington
which
has
been
so
often
invoked
in
its
support
are
greatly
weakened
by
the
development
of
these
facts
the
experiment
of
that
bank
satisfied
the
country
that
it
ought
not
to
be
continued
and
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
congress
refused
to
recharter
it
it
would
have
been
fortunate
for
the
country
and
saved
thousands
from
bankruptcy
and
ruin
had
our
public
men
of
resisted
the
temporary
pressure
of
the
times
upon
our
financial
and
pecuniary
interests
and
refused
to
charter
the
second
bank
of
this
the
country
became
abundantly
satisfied
and
at
the
close
of
its
twenty
years
duration
as
in
the
case
of
the
first
bank
it
also
ceased
to
exist
under
the
repeated
blows
of
president
jackson
it
reeled
and
fell
and
a
subsequent
attempt
to
charter
a
similar
institution
was
arrested
by
the
veto
of
president
tyler
mr
madison
in
yielding
his
signature
to
the
charter
of
did
so
upon
the
ground
of
the
respect
due
to
precedents
and
as
he
subsequently
declared
the
bank
of
the
united
states
though
on
the
original
question
held
to
be
unconstitutional
received
the
executive
signature
it
is
probable
that
neither
the
bank
of
nor
that
of
would
have
been
chartered
but
for
the
embarrassments
of
the
government
in
its
finances
the
derangement
of
the
currency
and
the
pecuniary
pressure
which
existed
the
first
the
consequence
of
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
the
second
the
consequence
of
the
war
of
both
were
resorted
to
in
the
delusive
hope
that
they
would
restore
public
credit
and
afford
relief
to
the
government
and
to
the
business
of
the
country
those
of
our
public
men
who
opposed
the
whole
american
system
at
its
commencement
and
throughout
its
progress
foresaw
and
predicted
that
it
was
fraught
with
incalculable
mischiefs
and
must
result
in
serious
injury
to
the
best
interests
of
the
country
for
a
series
of
years
their
wise
counsels
were
unheeded
and
the
system
was
established
it
was
soon
apparent
that
its
practical
operation
was
unequal
and
unjust
upon
different
portions
of
the
country
and
upon
the
people
engaged
in
different
pursuits
all
were
equally
entitled
to
the
favor
and
protection
of
the
government
it
fostered
and
elevated
the
money
power
and
enriched
the
favored
few
by
taxing
labor
and
at
the
expense
of
the
many
its
effect
was
to
make
the
rich
richer
and
the
poor
poorer
its
tendency
was
to
create
distinctions
in
society
based
on
wealth
and
to
give
to
the
favored
classes
undue
control
and
sway
in
our
government
it
was
an
organized
money
power
which
resisted
the
popular
will
and
sought
to
shape
and
control
the
public
policy
under
the
pernicious
workings
of
this
combined
system
of
measures
the
country
witnessed
alternate
seasons
of
temporary
apparent
prosperity
of
sudden
and
disastrous
commercial
revulsions
of
unprecedented
fluctuation
of
prices
and
depression
of
the
great
interests
of
agriculture
navigation
and
commerce
of
general
pecuniary
suffering
and
of
final
bankruptcy
of
thousands
after
a
severe
struggle
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
system
was
overthrown
the
bank
has
been
succeeded
by
a
practical
system
of
finance
conducted
and
controlled
solely
by
the
government
the
constitutional
currency
has
been
restored
the
public
credit
maintained
unimpaired
even
in
a
period
of
a
foreign
war
and
the
whole
country
has
become
satisfied
that
banks
national
or
state
are
not
necessary
as
fiscal
agents
of
the
government
revenue
duties
have
taken
the
place
of
the
protective
tariff
the
distribution
of
the
money
derived
from
the
sale
of
the
public
lands
has
been
abandoned
and
the
corrupting
system
of
internal
improvements
it
is
hoped
has
been
effectually
checked
it
is
not
doubted
that
if
this
whole
train
of
measures
designed
to
take
wealth
from
the
many
and
bestow
it
upon
the
few
were
to
prevail
the
effect
would
be
to
change
the
entire
character
of
the
government
one
only
danger
remains
it
is
the
seductions
of
that
branch
of
the
system
which
consists
in
internal
improvements
holding
out
as
it
does
inducements
to
the
people
of
particular
sections
and
localities
to
embark
the
government
in
them
without
stopping
to
calculate
the
inevitable
consequences
this
branch
of
the
system
is
so
intimately
combined
and
linked
with
the
others
that
as
surely
as
an
effect
is
produced
by
an
adequate
cause
if
it
be
resuscitated
and
revived
and
firmly
established
it
requires
no
sagacity
to
foresee
that
it
will
necessarily
and
speedily
draw
after
it
the
reestablishment
of
a
national
bank
the
revival
of
a
protective
tariff
the
distribution
of
the
land
money
and
not
only
the
postponement
to
the
distant
future
of
the
payment
of
the
present
national
debt
but
its
annual
increase
i
entertain
the
solemn
conviction
that
if
the
internalimprovement
branch
of
the
american
system
be
not
firmly
resisted
at
this
time
the
whole
series
of
measures
composing
it
will
be
speedily
reestablished
and
the
country
be
thrown
back
from
its
present
high
state
of
prosperity
which
the
existing
policy
has
produced
and
be
destined
again
to
witness
all
the
evils
commercial
revulsions
depression
of
prices
and
pecuniary
embarrassments
through
which
we
have
passed
during
the
last
twentyfive
years
to
guard
against
consequences
so
ruinous
is
an
object
of
high
national
importance
involving
in
my
judgment
the
continued
prosperity
of
the
country
i
have
felt
it
to
be
an
imperative
obligation
to
withhold
my
constitutional
sanction
from
two
bills
which
had
passed
the
two
houses
of
congress
involving
the
principle
of
the
internal
improvement
branch
of
the
american
system
and
conflicting
in
their
provisions
with
the
views
here
expressed
this
power
conferred
upon
the
president
by
the
constitution
i
have
on
three
occasions
during
my
administration
of
the
executive
department
of
the
government
deemed
it
my
duty
to
exercise
and
on
this
last
occasion
of
making
to
congress
an
annual
communication
of
the
state
of
the
union
it
is
not
deemed
inappropriate
to
review
the
principles
and
considerations
which
have
governed
my
action
i
deem
this
the
more
necessary
because
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
sixty
years
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
this
undoubted
constitutional
power
by
the
president
has
for
the
first
time
been
drawn
seriously
in
question
by
a
portion
of
my
fellowcitizens
the
constitution
provides
that
every
bill
which
shall
have
passed
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
shall
before
it
beco
me
a
law
be
presented
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
if
he
approve
he
shall
sign
it
but
if
not
he
shall
return
it
with
his
objections
to
that
house
in
which
it
shall
have
originated
who
shall
enter
the
objections
at
large
on
their
journal
and
proceed
to
reconsider
it
the
preservation
of
the
constitution
from
infraction
is
the
presidents
highest
duty
he
is
bound
to
discharge
that
duty
at
whatever
hazard
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
those
who
may
differ
with
him
in
opinion
he
is
bound
to
discharge
it
as
well
by
his
obligations
to
the
people
who
have
clothed
him
with
his
exalted
trust
as
by
his
oath
of
office
which
he
may
not
disregard
nor
are
the
obligations
of
the
president
in
any
degree
lessened
by
the
prevalence
of
views
different
from
his
own
in
one
or
both
houses
of
congress
it
is
not
alone
hasty
and
inconsiderate
legislation
that
he
is
required
to
check
but
if
at
any
time
congress
shall
after
apparently
full
deliberation
resolve
on
measures
which
he
deems
subversive
of
the
constitution
or
of
the
vital
interests
of
the
country
it
is
his
solemn
duty
to
stand
in
the
breach
and
resist
them
the
president
is
bound
to
approve
or
disapprove
every
bill
which
passes
congress
and
is
presented
to
him
for
his
signature
the
constitution
makes
this
his
duty
and
he
can
not
escape
it
if
he
would
he
has
no
election
in
deciding
upon
any
bill
presented
to
him
he
must
exercise
his
own
best
judgment
if
he
can
not
approve
the
constitution
commands
him
to
return
the
bill
to
the
house
in
which
it
originated
with
his
objections
and
if
he
fail
to
do
this
within
ten
days
sundays
excepted
it
shall
become
a
law
without
his
signature
right
or
wrong
he
may
be
overruled
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
each
house
and
in
that
event
the
bill
becomes
a
law
without
his
sanction
if
his
objections
be
not
thus
overruled
the
subject
is
only
postponed
and
is
referred
to
the
states
and
the
people
for
their
consideration
and
decision
the
presidents
power
is
negative
merely
and
not
affirmative
he
can
enact
no
law
the
only
effect
therefore
of
his
withholding
his
approval
of
a
bill
passed
by
congress
is
to
suffer
the
existing
laws
to
remain
unchanged
and
the
delay
occasioned
is
only
that
required
to
enable
the
states
and
the
people
to
consider
and
act
upon
the
subject
in
the
election
of
public
agents
who
will
carry
out
their
wishes
and
instructions
any
attempt
to
coerce
the
president
to
yield
his
sanction
to
measures
which
he
can
not
approve
would
be
a
violation
of
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
palpable
and
flagrant
and
if
successful
would
break
down
the
independence
of
the
executive
department
and
make
the
president
elected
by
the
people
and
clothed
by
the
constitution
with
power
to
defend
their
rights
the
mere
instrument
of
a
majority
of
congress
a
surrender
on
his
part
of
the
powers
with
which
the
constitution
has
invested
his
office
would
effect
a
practical
alteration
of
that
instrument
without
resorting
to
the
prescribed
process
of
amendment
with
the
motives
or
considerations
which
may
induce
congress
to
pass
any
bill
the
president
can
have
nothing
to
do
he
must
presume
them
to
be
as
pure
as
his
own
and
look
only
to
the
practical
effect
of
their
measures
when
compared
with
the
constitution
or
the
public
good
but
it
has
been
urged
by
those
who
object
to
the
exercise
of
this
undoubted
constitutional
power
that
it
assails
the
representative
principle
and
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
that
there
is
greater
safety
in
a
numerous
representative
body
than
in
the
single
executive
created
by
the
constitution
and
that
the
executive
veto
is
a
oneman
power
despotic
in
its
character
to
expose
the
fallacy
of
this
objection
it
is
only
necessary
to
consider
the
frame
and
true
character
of
our
system
ours
is
not
a
consolidated
empire
but
a
confederated
union
the
states
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
were
coordinate
coequal
and
separate
independent
sovereignties
and
by
its
adoption
they
did
not
lose
that
character
they
clothed
the
federal
government
with
certain
powers
and
reserved
all
others
including
their
own
sovereignty
to
themselves
they
guarded
their
own
rights
as
states
and
the
rights
of
the
people
by
the
very
limitations
which
they
incorporated
into
the
federal
constitution
whereby
the
different
departments
of
the
general
government
were
checks
upon
each
other
that
the
majority
should
govern
is
a
general
principle
controverted
by
none
but
they
must
govern
according
to
the
constitution
and
not
according
to
an
undefined
and
unrestrained
discretion
whereby
they
may
oppress
the
minority
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
they
may
be
temporarily
misled
and
that
their
representatives
legislative
and
executive
may
be
mistaken
or
influenced
in
their
action
by
improper
motives
they
have
therefore
interposed
between
themselves
and
the
laws
which
may
be
passed
by
their
public
agents
various
representations
such
as
assemblies
senates
and
governors
in
their
several
states
a
house
of
representatives
a
senate
and
a
president
of
the
united
states
the
people
can
by
their
own
direct
agency
make
no
law
nor
can
the
house
of
representatives
immediately
elected
by
them
nor
can
the
senate
nor
can
both
together
without
the
concurrence
of
the
president
or
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
happily
for
themselves
the
people
in
framing
our
admirable
system
of
government
were
conscious
of
the
infirmities
of
their
representatives
and
in
delegating
to
them
the
power
of
legislation
they
have
fenced
them
around
with
checks
to
guard
against
the
effects
of
hasty
action
of
error
of
combination
and
of
possible
corruption
error
selfishness
and
faction
have
often
sought
to
rend
asunder
this
web
of
checks
and
subject
the
government
to
the
control
of
fanatic
and
sinister
influences
but
these
efforts
have
only
satisfied
the
people
of
the
wisdom
of
the
checks
which
they
have
imposed
and
of
the
necessity
of
preserving
them
unimpaired
the
true
theory
of
our
system
is
not
to
govern
by
the
acts
or
decrees
of
any
one
set
of
representatives
the
constitution
interposes
checks
upon
all
branches
of
the
government
in
order
to
give
time
for
error
to
be
corrected
and
delusion
to
pass
away
but
if
the
people
settle
down
into
a
firm
conviction
different
from
that
of
their
representatives
they
give
effect
to
their
opinions
by
changing
their
public
servants
the
checks
which
the
people
imposed
on
their
public
servants
in
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
are
the
best
evidence
of
their
capacity
for
selfgovernment
they
know
that
the
men
whom
they
elect
to
public
stations
are
of
like
infirmities
and
passions
with
themselves
and
not
to
be
trusted
without
being
restricted
by
coordinate
authorities
and
constitutional
limitations
who
that
has
witnessed
the
legislation
of
congress
for
the
last
thirty
years
will
say
that
he
knows
of
no
instance
in
which
measures
not
demanded
by
the
public
good
have
been
carried
who
will
deny
that
in
the
state
governments
by
combinations
of
individuals
and
sections
in
derogation
of
the
general
interest
banks
have
been
chartered
systems
of
internal
improvements
adopted
and
debts
entailed
upon
the
people
repressing
their
growth
and
impairing
their
energies
for
years
to
come
after
so
much
experience
it
can
not
be
said
that
absolute
unchecked
power
is
safe
in
the
hands
of
any
one
set
of
representatives
or
that
the
capacity
of
the
people
for
selfgovernment
which
is
admitted
in
its
broadest
extent
is
a
conclusive
argument
to
prove
the
prudence
wisdom
and
integrity
of
their
representatives
the
people
by
the
constitution
have
commanded
the
president
as
much
as
they
have
commanded
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
to
execute
their
will
they
have
said
to
him
in
the
constitution
which
they
require
he
shall
take
a
solemn
oath
to
support
that
if
congress
pass
any
bill
which
he
can
not
approve
he
shall
return
it
to
the
house
in
which
it
originated
with
his
objections
in
withholding
from
it
his
approval
and
signature
he
is
executing
the
will
of
the
people
constitutionally
expressed
as
much
as
the
congress
that
passed
it
no
bill
is
presumed
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
popular
will
until
it
shall
have
passed
through
all
the
branches
of
the
government
required
by
the
constitution
to
make
it
a
law
a
bill
which
passes
the
house
of
representatives
may
be
rejected
by
the
senate
and
so
a
bill
passed
by
the
senate
may
be
rejected
by
the
house
in
each
case
the
respective
houses
exercise
the
veto
power
on
the
other
congress
and
each
house
of
congress
hold
under
the
constitution
a
check
upon
the
president
and
he
by
the
power
of
the
qualified
veto
a
check
upon
congress
when
the
president
recommends
measures
to
congress
he
avows
in
the
most
solemn
form
his
opinions
gives
his
voice
in
their
favor
and
pledges
himself
in
advance
to
approve
them
if
passed
by
congress
if
he
acts
without
due
consideration
or
has
been
influenced
by
improper
or
corrupt
motives
or
if
from
any
other
cause
congress
or
either
house
of
congress
shall
differ
with
him
in
opinion
they
exercise
their
veto
upon
his
recommendations
and
reject
them
and
there
is
no
appeal
from
their
decision
but
to
the
people
at
the
ballot
box
these
are
proper
checks
upon
the
executive
wisely
interposed
by
the
constitution
none
will
be
found
to
object
to
them
or
to
wish
them
removed
it
is
equally
important
that
the
constitutional
checks
of
the
executive
upon
the
legislative
branch
should
be
preserved
if
it
be
said
that
the
representatives
in
the
popular
branch
of
congress
are
chosen
directly
by
the
people
it
is
answered
the
people
elect
the
president
if
both
houses
represent
the
states
and
the
people
so
does
the
president
the
president
represents
in
the
executive
department
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
as
each
member
of
the
legislative
department
represents
portions
of
them
the
doctrine
of
restriction
upon
legislative
and
executive
power
while
a
wellsettled
public
opinion
is
enabled
within
a
reasonable
time
to
accomplish
its
ends
has
made
our
country
what
it
is
and
has
opened
to
us
a
career
of
glory

and
happiness
to
which
all
other
nations
have
been
strangers
in
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
veto
the
president
is
responsible
not
only
to
an
enlightened
public
opinion
but
to
the
people
of
the
whole
union
who
elected
him
as
the
representatives
in
the
legislative
branches
who
differ
with
him
in
opinion
are
responsible
to
the
people
of
particular
states
or
districts
who
compose
their
respective
constituencies
to
deny
to
the
president
the
exercise
of
this
power
would
be
to
repeal
that
provision
of
the
constitution
which
confers
it
upon
him
to
charge
that
its
exercise
unduly
controls
the
legislative
will
is
to
complain
of
the
constitution
itself
if
the
presidential
veto
be
objected
to
upon
the
ground
that
it
checks
and
thwarts
the
popular
will
upon
the
same
principle
the
equality
of
representation
of
the
states
in
the
senate
should
be
stricken
out
of
the
constitution
the
vote
of
a
senator
from
delaware
has
equal
weight
in
deciding
upon
the
most
important
measures
with
the
vote
of
a
senator
from
new
york
and
yet
the
one
represents
a
state
containing
according
to
the
existing
apportionment
of
representatives
in
the
house
of
representatives
but
one
thirtyfourth
part
of
the
population
of
the
other
by
the
constitutional
composition
of
the
senate
a
majority
of
that
body
from
the
smaller
states
represent
less
than
onefourth
of
the
people
of
the
union
there
are
thirty
states
and
under
the
existing
apportionment
of
representatives
there
are
members
in
the
house
of
representatives
sixteen
of
the
smaller
states
are
represented
in
that
house
by
but
members
and
yet
the
senators
from
these
states
constitute
a
majority
of
the
senate
so
that
the
president
may
recommend
a
measure
to
congress
and
it
may
receive
the
sanction
and
approval
of
more
than
threefourths
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
all
the
senators
from
the
large
states
containing
more
than
threefourths
of
the
whole
population
of
the
united
states
and
yet
the
measure
may
be
defeated
by
the
votes
of
the
senators
from
the
smaller
states
none
it
is
presumed
can
be
found
ready
to
change
the
organization
of
the
senate
on
this
account
or
to
strike
that
body
practically
out
of
existence
by
requiring
that
its
action
shall
be
conformed
to
the
will
of
the
more
numerous
branch
upon
the
same
principle
that
the
veto
of
the
president
should
be
practically
abolished
the
power
of
the
vicepresident
to
give
the
casting
vote
upon
an
equal
division
of
the
senate
should
be
abolished
also
the
vicepresident
exercises
the
veto
power
as
effectually
by
rejecting
a
bill
by
his
casting
vote
as
the
president
does
by
refusing
to
approve
and
sign
it
this
power
has
been
exercised
by
the
vicepresident
in
a
few
instances
the
most
important
of
which
was
the
rejection
of
the
bill
to
recharter
the
bank
of
the
united
states
in
it
may
happen
that
a
bill
may
be
passed
by
a
large
majority
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
may
be
supported
by
the
senators
from
the
larger
states
and
the
vicepresident
may
reject
it
by
giving
his
vote
with
the
senators
from
the
smaller
states
and
yet
none
it
is
presumed
are
prepared
to
deny
to
him
the
exercise
of
this
power
under
the
constitution
but
it
is
in
point
of
fact
untrue
that
an
act
passed
by
congress
is
conclusive
evidence
that
it
is
an
emanation
of
the
popular
will
a
majority
of
the
whole
number
elected
to
each
house
of
congress
constitutes
a
quorum
and
a
majority
of
that
quorum
is
competent
to
pass
laws
it
might
happen
that
a
quorum
of
the
house
of
representatives
consisting
of
a
single
member
more
than
half
of
the
whole
number
elected
to
that
house
might
pass
a
bill
by
a
majority
of
a
single
vote
and
in
that
case
a
fraction
more
than
onefourth
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
would
be
represented
by
those
who
voted
for
it
it
might
happen
that
the
same
bill
might
be
passed
by
a
majority
of
one
of
a
quorum
of
the
senate
composed
of
senators
from
the
fifteen
smaller
states
and
a
single
senator
from
a
sixteenth
state
and
if
the
senators
voting
for
it
happened
to
be
from
the
eight
of
the
smallest
of
these
states
it
would
be
passed
by
the
votes
of
senators
from
states
having
but
fourteen
representatives
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
containing
less
than
onesixteenth
of
the
whole
population
of
the
united
states
this
extreme
case
is
stated
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
the
mere
passage
of
a
bill
by
congress
is
no
conclusive
evidence
that
those
who
passed
it
represent
the
majority
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
or
truly
reflect
their
will
if
such
an
extreme
case
is
not
likely
to
happen
cases
that
approximate
it
are
of
constant
occurrence
it
is
believed
that
not
a
single
law
has
been
passed
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
upon
which
all
the
members
elected
to
both
houses
have
been
present
and
voted
many
of
the
most
important
acts
which
have
passed
congress
have
been
carried
by
a
close
vote
in
thin
houses
many
instances
of
this
might
be
given
indeed
our
experience
proves
that
many
of
the
most
important
acts
of
congress
are
postponed
to
the
last
days
and
often
the
last
hours
of
a
session
when
they
are
disposed
of
in
haste
and
by
houses
but
little
exceeding
the
number
necessary
to
form
a
quorum
besides
in
most
of
the
states
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
are
chosen
by
pluralities
and
not
by
majorities
of
all
the
voters
in
their
respective
districts
and
it
may
happen
that
a
majority
of
that
house
may
be
returned
by
a
less
aggregate
vote
of
the
people
than
that
received
by
the
minority
if
the
principle
insisted
on
be
sound
then
the
constitution
should
be
so
changed
that
no
bill
shall
become
a
law
unless
it
is
voted
for
by
members
representing
in
each
house
a
majority
of
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
we
must
remodel
our
whole
system
strike
down
and
abolish
not
only
the
salutary
checks
lodged
in
the
executive
branch
but
must
strike
out
and
abolish
those
lodged
in
the
senate
also
and
thus
practically
invest
the
whole
power
of
the
government
in
a
majority
of
a
single
assemblya
majority
uncontrolled
and
absolute
and
which
may
become
despotic
to
conform
to
this
doctrine
of
the
right
of
majorities
to
rule
independent
of
the
checks
and
limitations
of
the
constitution
we
must
revolutionize
our
whole
system
we
must
destroy
the
constitutional
compact
by
which
the
several
states
agreed
to
form
a
federal
union
and
rush
into
consolidation
which
must
end
in
monarchy
or
despotism
no
one
advocates
such
a
proposition
and
yet
the
doctrine
maintained
if
carried
out
must
lead
to
this
result
one
great
object
of
the
constitution
in
conferring
upon
the
president
a
qualified
negative
upon
the
legislation
of
congress
was
to
protect
minorities
from
injustice
and
oppression
by
majorities
the
equality
of
their
representation
in
the
senate
and
the
veto
power
of
the
president
are
the
constitutional
guaranties
which
the
smaller
states
have
that
their
rights
will
be
respected
without
these
guaranties
all
their
interests
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
majorities
in
congress
representing
the
larger
states
to
the
smaller
and
weaker
states
therefore
the
preservation
of
this
power
and
its
exercise
upon
proper
occasions
demanding
it
is
of
vital
importance
they
ratified
the
constitution
and
entered
into
the
union
securing
to
themselves
an
equal
representation
with
the
larger
states
in
the
senate
and
they
agreed
to
be
bound
by
all
laws
passed
by
congress
upon
the
express
condition
and
none
other
that
they
should
be
approved
by
the
president
or
passed
his
objections
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
upon
this
condition
they
have
a
right
to
insist
as
a
part
of
the
compact
to
which
they
gave
their
assent
a
bill
might
be
passed
by
congress
against
the
will
of
the
whole
people
of
a
particular
state
and
against
the
votes
of
its
senators
and
all
its
representatives
however
prejudicial
it
might
be
to
the
interests
of
such
state
it
would
be
bound
by
it
if
the
president
shall
approve
it
or
it
shall
be
passed
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
but
it
has
a
right
to
demand
that
the
president
shall
exercise
his
constitutional
power
and
arrest
it
if
his
judgment
is
against
it
if
he
surrender
this
power
or
fail
to
exercise
it
in
a
case
where
he
can
not
approve
it
would
make
his
formal
approval
a
mere
mockery
and
would
be
itself
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
dissenting
state
would
become
bound
by
a
law
which
had
not
been
passed
according
to
the
sanctions
of
the
constitution
the
objection
to
the
exercise
of
the
veto
power
is
founded
upon
an
idea
respecting
the
popular
will
which
if
carried
out
would
annihilate
state
sovereignty
and
substitute
for
the
present
federal
government
a
consolidation
directed
by
a
supposed
numerical
majority
a
revolution
of
the
government
would
be
silently
effected
and
the
states
would
be
subjected
to
laws
to
which
they
had
never
given
their
constitutional
consent
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
invested
with
the
power
to
declare
and
has
declared
acts
of
congress
passed
with
the
concurrence
of
the
senate
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
approval
of
the
president
to
be
unconstitutional
and
void
and
yet
none
it
is
presumed
can
be
found
who
will
be
disposed
to
strip
this
highest
judicial
tribunal
under
the
constitution
of
this
acknowledged
powera
power
necessary
alike
to
its
independence
and
the
rights
of
individuals
for
the
same
reason
that
the
executive
veto
should
according
to
the
doctrine
maintained
be
rendered
nugatory
and
be
practically
expunged
from
the
constitution
this
power
of
the
court
should
also
be
rendered
nugatory
and
be
expunged
because
it
restrains
the
legislative
and
executive
will
and
because
the
exercise
of
such
a
power
by
the
court
may
be
regarded
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
indeed
there
is
more
reason
for
striking
this
power
of
the
court
from
the
constitution
than
there
is
that
of
the
qualified
veto
of
the
president
because
the
decision
of
the
court
is
final
and
can
never
be
reversed
even
though
both
houses
of
congress
and
the
president
shou
ld
be
unanimous
in
opposition
to
it
whereas
the
veto
of
the
president
may
be
overruled
by
a
vote
of
twothirds
of
both
houses
of
congress
or
by
the
people
at
the
polls
it
is
obvious
that
to
preserve
the
system
established
by
the
constitution
each
of
the
coordinate
branches
of
the
governmentthe
executive
legislative
and
judicialmust
be
left
in
the
exercise
of
its
appropriate
powers
if
the
executive
or
the
judicial
branch
be
deprived
of
powers
conferred
upon
either
as
checks
on
the
legislative
the
preponderance
of
the
latter
will
become
disproportionate
and
absorbing
and
the
others
impotent
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
great
objects
for
which
they
were
established
organized
as
they
are
by
the
constitution
they
work
together
harmoniously
for
the
public
good
if
the
executive
and
the
judiciary
shall
be
deprived
of
the
constitutional
powers
invested
in
them
and
of
their
due
proportions
the
equilibrium
of
the
system
must
be
destroyed
and
consolidation
with
the
most
pernicious
results
must
ensuea
consolidation
of
unchecked
despotic
power
exercised
by
majorities
of
the
legislative
branch
the
executive
legislative
and
judicial
each
constitutes
a
separate
coordinate
department
of
the
government
and
each
is
independent
of
the
others
in
the
performance
of
their
respective
duties
under
the
constitution
neither
can
in
its
legitimate
action
control
the
others
they
each
act
upon
their
several
responsibilities
in
their
respective
spheres
but
if
the
doctrines
now
maintained
be
correct
the
executive
must
become
practically
subordinate
to
the
legislative
and
the
judiciary
must
become
subordinate
to
both
the
legislative
and
the
executive
and
thus
the
whole
power
of
the
government
would
be
merged
in
a
single
department
whenever
if
ever
this
shall
occur
our
glorious
system
of
wellregulated
selfgovernment
will
crumble
into
ruins
to
be
succeeded
first
by
anarchy
and
finally
by
monarchy
or
despotism
i
am
far
from
believing
that
this
doctrine
is
the
sentiment
of
the
american
people
and
during
the
short
period
which
remains
in
which
it
will
be
my
duty
to
administer
the
executive
department
it
will
be
my
aim
to
maintain
its
independence
and
discharge
its
duties
without
infringing
upon
the
powers
or
duties
of
either
of
the
other
departments
of
the
government
the
power
of
the
executive
veto
was
exercised
by
the
first
and
most
illustrious
of
my
predecessors
and
by
four
of
his
successors
who
preceded
me
in
the
administration
of
the
government
and
it
is
believed
in
no
instance
prejudicially
to
the
public
interests
it
has
never
been
and
there
is
but
little
danger
that
it
ever
can
be
abused
no
president
will
ever
desire
unnecessarily
to
place
his
opinion
in
opposition
to
that
of
congress
he
must
always
exercise
the
power
reluctantly
and
only
in
cases
where
his
convictions
make
it
a
matter
of
stern
duty
which
he
can
not
escape
indeed
there
is
more
danger
that
the
president
from
the
repugnance
he
must
always
feel
to
come
in
collision
with
congress
may
fail
to
exercise
it
in
cases
where
the
preservation
of
the
constitution
from
infraction
or
the
public
good
may
demand
it
than
that
he
will
ever
exercise
it
unnecessarily
or
wantonly
during
the
period
i
have
administered
the
executive
department
of
the
government
great
and
important
questions
of
public
policy
foreign
and
domestic
have
arisen
upon
which
it
was
my
duty
to
act
it
may
indeed
be
truly
said
that
my
administration
has
fallen
upon
eventful
times
i
have
felt
most
sensibly
the
weight
of
the
high
responsibilities
devolved
upon
me
with
no
other
object
than
the
public
good
the
enduring
fame
and
permanent
prosperity
of
my
country
i
have
pursued
the
convictions
of
my
own
best
judgment
the
impartial
arbitrament
of
enlightened
public
opinion
present
and
future
will
determine
how
far
the
public
policy
i
have
maintained
and
the
measures
i
have
from
time
to
time
recommended
may
have
tended
to
advance
or
retard
the
public
prosperity
at
home
and
to
elevate
or
depress
the
estimate
of
our
national
character
abroad
invoking
the
blessings
of
the
almighty
upon
your
deliberations
at
your
present
important
session
my
ardent
hope
is
that
in
a
spirit
of
harmony
and
concord
you
may
be
guided
to
wise
results
and
such
as
may
redound
to
the
happiness
the
honor
and
the
glory
of
our
beloved

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
annual
meeting
of
congress
is
always
an
interesting
event
the
representatives
of
the
states
and
of
the
people
come
fresh
from
their
constituents
to
take
counsel
together
for
the
common
good
after
an
existence
of
near
threefourths
of
a
century
as
a
free
and
independent
republic
the
problem
no
longer
remains
to
be
solved
whether
man
is
capable
of
selfgovernment
the
success
of
our
admirable
system
is
a
conclusive
refutation
of
the
theories
of
those
in
other
countries
who
maintain
that
a
favored
few
are
born
to
rule
and
that
the
mass
of
mankind
must
be
governed
by
force
subject
to
no
arbitrary
or
hereditary
authority
the
people
are
the
only
sovereigns
recognized
by
our
constitution
numerous
emigrants
of
every
lineage
and
language
attracted
by
the
civil
and
religious
freedom
we
enjoy
and
by
our
happy
condition
annually
crowd
to
our
shores
and
transfer
their
heart
not
less
than
their
allegiance
to
the
country
whose
dominion
belongs
alone
to
the
people
no
country
has
been
so
much
favored
or
should
acknowledge
with
deeper
reverence
the
manifestations
of
the
divine
protection
an
all
wise
creator
directed
and
guarded
us
in
our
infant
struggle
for
freedom
and
has
constantly
watched
over
our
surprising
progress
until
we
have
become
one
of
the
great
nations
of
the
earth
it
is
in
a
country
thus
favored
and
under
a
government
in
which
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
hold
their
authority
for
limited
periods
alike
from
the
people
and
where
all
are
responsible
to
their
respective
constituencies
that
it
is
again
my
duty
to
communicate
with
congress
upon
the
state
of
the
union
and
the
present
condition
of
public
affairs
during
the
past
year
the
most
gratifying
proofs
are
presented
that
our
country
has
been
blessed
with
a
widespread
and
universal
prosperity
there
has
been
no
period
since
the
government
was
founded
when
all
the
industrial
pursuits
of
our
people
have
been
more
successful
or
when
labor
in
all
branches
of
business
has
received
a
fairer
or
better
reward
from
our
abundance
we
have
been
enabled
to
perform
the
pleasing
duty
of
furnishing
food
for
the
starving
millions
of
less
favored
countries
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
bounties
of
providence
at
home
such
as
have
rarely
fallen
to
the
lot
of
any
people
it
is
cause
of
congratulation
that
our
intercourse
with
all
the
powers
of
the
earth
except
mexico
continues
to
be
of
an
amicable
character
it
has
ever
been
our
cherished
policy
to
cultivate
peace
and
good
will
with
all
nations
and
this
policy
has
been
steadily
pursued
by
me
no
change
has
taken
place
in
our
relations
with
mexico
since
the
adjournment
of
the
last
congress
the
war
in
which
the
united
states
were
forced
to
engage
with
the
government
of
that
country
still
continues
i
deem
it
unnecessary
after
the
full
exposition
of
them
contained
in
my
message
of
the
th
of
may
and
in
my
annual
message
at
the
commencement
of
the
session
of
congress
in
december
last
to
reiterate
the
serious
causes
of
complaint
which
we
had
against
mexico
before
she
commenced
hostilities
it
is
sufficient
on
the
present
occasion
to
say
that
the
wanton
violation
of
the
rights
of
person
and
property
of
our
citizens
committed
by
mexico
her
repeated
acts
of
bad
faith
through
a
long
series
of
years
and
her
disregard
of
solemn
treaties
stipulating
for
indemnity
to
our
injured
citizens
not
only
constituted
ample
cause
of
war
on
our
part
but
were
of
such
an
aggravated
character
as
would
have
justified
us
before
the
whole
world
in
resorting
to
this
extreme
remedy
with
an
anxious
desire
to
avoid
a
rupture
between
the
two
countries
we
forbore
for
years
to
assert
our
clear
rights
by
force
and
continued
to
seek
redress
for
the
wrongs
we
had
suffered
by
amicable
negotiation
in
the
hope
that
mexico
might
yield
to
pacific
counsels
and
the
demands
of
justice
in
this
hope
we
were
disappointed
our
minister
of
peace
sent
to
mexico
was
insultingly
rejected
the
mexican
government
refused
even
to
hear
the
terms
of
adjustment
which
he
was
authorized
to
propose
and
finally
under
wholly
unjustifiable
pretexts
involved
the
two
countries
in
war
by
invading
the
territory
of
the
state
of
texas
striking
the
first
blow
and
shedding
the
blood
of
our
citizens
on
our
own
soil
though
the
united
states
were
the
aggrieved
nation
mexico
commenced
the
war
and
we
were
compelled
in
selfdefense
to
repel
the
invader
and
to
vindicate
the
national
honor
and
interests
by
prosecuting
it
with
vigor
until
we
could
obtain
a
just
and
honorable
peace
on
learning
that
hostilities
had
been
commenced
by
mexico
i
promptly
communicated
that
fact
accompanied
with
a
succinct
statement
of
our
other
causes
of
complaint
against
mexico
to
congress
and
that
body
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
may
declared
that
by
the
act
of
the
republic
of
mexico
a
state
of
war
exists
between
that
government
and
the
united
states
this
act
declaring
the
war
to
exist
by
the
act
of
the
republic
of
mexico
and
making
provision
for
its
prosecution
to
a
speedy
and
successful
termination
was
passed
with
great
unanimity
by
congress
there
being
but
two
negative
votes
in
the
senate
and
but
fourteen
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
existence
of
the
war
having
thus
been
declared
by
congress
it
became
my
duty
under
the
constitution
and
the
laws
to
conduct
and
prosecute
it
this
duty
has
been
performed
and
though
at
every
stage
of
its
progress
i
have
manifested
a
willingness
to
terminate
it
by
a
just
peace
mexico
has
refused
to
accede
to
any
terms
which
could
be
accepted
by
the
united
states
consistently
with
the
national
honor
and
interest
the
rapid
and
brilliant
successes
of
our
arms
and
the
vast
extent
of
the
enemys
territory
which
had
been
overrun
and
conquered
before
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
congress
were
fully
known
to
that
body
since
that
time
the
war
has
been
prosecuted
with
increased
energy
and
i
am
gratified
to
state
with
a
success
which
commands
universal
admiration
history
presents
no
parallel
of
so
many
glorious
victories
achieved
by
any
nation
within
so
short
a
period
our
army
regulars
and
volunteers
have
covered
themselves
with
imperishable
honors
whenever
and
wherever
our
forces
have
encountered
the
enemy
though
he
was
in
vastly
superior
numbers
and
often
intrenched
in
fortified
positions
of
his
own
selection
and
of
great
strength
he
has
been
defeated
too
much
praise
can
not
be
bestowed
upon
our
officers
and
men
regulars
and
volunteers
for
their
gallantry
discipline
indomitable
courage
and
perseverance
all
seeking
the
post
of
danger
and
vying
with
each
other
in
deeds
of
noble
daring
while
every
patriots
heart
must
exult
and
a
just
national
pride
animate
every
bosom
in
beholding
the
high
proofs
of
courage
consummate
military
skill
steady
discipline
and
humanity
to
the
vanquished
enemy
exhibited
by
our
gallant
army
the
nation
is
called
to
mourn
over
the
loss
of
many
brave
officers
and
soldiers
who
have
fallen
in
defense
of
their
countrys
honor
and
interests
the
brave
dead
met
their
melancholy
fate
in
a
foreign
land
nobly
discharging
their
duty
and
with
their
countrys
flag
waving
triumphantly
in
the
face
of
the
foe
their
patriotic
deeds
are
justly
appreciated
and
will
long
be
remembered
by
their
grateful
countrymen
the
parental
care
of
the
government
they
loved
and
served
should
be
extended
to
their
surviving
families
shortly
after
the
adjournment
of
the
last
session
of
congress
the
gratifying
intelligence
was
received
of
the
signal
victory
of
buena
vista
and
of
the
fall
of
the
city
of
vera
cruz
and
with
it
the
strong
castle
of
san
juan
de
ulloa
by
which
it
was
defended
believing
that
after
these
and
other
successes
so
honorable
to
our
arms
and
so
disastrous
to
mexico
the
period
was
propitious
to
afford
her
another
opportunity
if
she
thought
proper
to
embrace
it
to
enter
into
negotiations
for
peace
a
commissioner
was
appointed
to
proceed
to
the
headquarters
of
our
army
with
full
powers
to
enter
upon
negotiations
and
to
conclude
a
just
and
honorable
treaty
of
peace
he
was
not
directed
to
make
any
new
overtures
of
peace
but
was
the
bearer
of
a
dispatch
from
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
to
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
mexico
in
reply
to
one
received
from
the
latter
of
the
d
of
february
in
which
the
mexican
government
was
informed
of
his
appointment
and
of
his
presence
at
the
headquarters
of
our
army
and
that
he
was
invested
with
full
powers
to
conclude
a
definitive
treaty
of
peace
whenever
the
mexican
government
might
signify
a
desire
to
do
so
while
i
was
unwilling
to
subject
the
united
states
to
another
indignant
refusal
i
was
yet
resolved
that
the
evils
of
the
war
should
not
be
protracted
a
day
longer
than
might
be
rendered
absolutely
necessary
by
the
mexican
government
care
was
taken
to
give
no
instructions
to
the
commissioner
which
could
in
any
way
interfere
with
our
military
operations
or
relax
our
energies
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
he
possessed
no
authority
in
any
manner
to
control
these
operations
he
was
authorized
to
exhibit
his
instructions
to
the
general
in
command
of
the
army
and
in
the
event
of
a
treaty
being
concluded
and
ratified
on
the
part
of
mexico
he
was
directed
to
give
him
notice
of
that
fact
on
the
happening
of
such
contingency
and
on
receiving
notice
thereof
the
general
in
command
was
instructed
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
suspend
further
active
military
operations
until
further
orders
these
instructions
were
given
with
a
view
to
intermit
hostilities
until
the
treaty
thus
ratified
by
mexico
could
be
transmitted
to
washington
and
receive
the
action
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
commissioner
was
also
directed
on
reaching
the
army
to
deliver
to
the
general
in
command
the
dispatch
which
he
bore
from
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
mexico
and
on
receiving
it
the
general
was
instructed
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
cause
it
to
be
transmitted
to
the
commander
of
the
mexican
forces
with
a
quest
that
it
might
be
communicated
to
his
government
the
commissioner
did
not
reach
the
headqua
rters
of
the
army
until
after
another
brilliant
victory
had
crowned
our
arms
at
cerro
gordo
the
dispatch
which
he
bore
from
the
secretary
of
war
to
the
general
in
command
of
the
army
was
received
by
that
officer
then
at
jalapa
on
the
th
of
may
together
with
the
dispatch
from
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
mexico
having
been
transmitted
to
him
from
vera
cruz
the
commissioner
arrived
at
the
headquarters
of
the
army
a
few
days
afterwards
his
presence
with
the
army
and
his
diplomatic
character
were
made
known
to
the
mexican
government
from
puebla
on
the
th
of
june
by
the
transmission
of
the
dispatch
from
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
mexico
many
weeks
elapsed
after
its
receipt
and
no
overtures
were
made
nor
was
any
desire
expressed
by
the
mexican
government
to
enter
into
negotiations
for
peace
our
army
pursued
its
march
upon
the
capital
and
as
it
approached
it
was
met
by
formidable
resistance
our
forces
first
encountered
the
enemy
and
achieved
signal
victories
in
the
severely
contested
battles
of
contreras
and
churubusco
it
was
not
until
after
these
actions
had
resulted
in
decisive
victories
and
the
capital
of
the
enemy
was
within
our
power
that
the
mexican
government
manifested
any
disposition
to
enter
into
negotiations
for
peace
and
even
then
as
events
have
proved
there
is
too
much
reason
to
believe
they
were
insincere
and
that
in
agreeing
to
go
through
the
forms
of
negotiation
the
object
was
to
gain
time
to
strengthen
the
defenses
of
their
capital
and
to
prepare
for
fresh
resistance
the
general
in
command
of
the
army
deemed
it
expedient
to
suspend
hostilities
temporarily
by
entering
into
an
armistice
with
a
view
to
the
opening
of
negotiations
commissioners
were
appointed
on
the
part
of
mexico
to
meet
the
commissioner
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
the
result
of
the
conferences
which
took
place
between
these
functionaries
of
the
two
governments
was
a
failure
to
conclude
a
treaty
of
peace
the
commissioner
of
the
united
states
took
with
him
the
project
of
a
treaty
already
prepared
by
the
terms
of
which
the
indemnity
required
by
the
united
states
was
a
cession
of
territory
it
is
well
known
that
the
only
indemnity
which
it
is
in
the
power
of
mexico
to
make
in
satisfaction
of
the
just
and
longdeferred
claims
of
our
citizens
against
her
and
the
only
means
by
which
she
can
reimburse
the
united
states
for
the
expenses
of
the
war
is
a
cession
to
the
united
states
of
a
portion
of
her
territory
mexico
has
no
money
to
pay
and
no
other
means
of
making
the
required
indemnity
if
we
refuse
this
we
can
obtain
nothing
else
to
reject
indemnity
by
refusing
to
accept
a
cession
of
territory
would
be
to
abandon
all
our
just
demands
and
to
wage
the
war
bearing
all
its
expenses
without
a
purpose
or
definite
object
a
state
of
war
abrogates
treaties
previously
existing
between
the
belligerents
and
a
treaty
of
peace
puts
an
end
to
all
claims
for
indemnity
for
tortious
acts
committed
under
the
authority
of
one
government
against
the
citizens
or
subjects
of
another
unless
they
are
provided
for
in
its
stipulations
a
treaty
of
peace
which
would
terminate
the
existing
war
without
providing
for
indemnity
would
enable
mexico
the
acknowledged
debtor
and
herself
the
aggressor
in
the
war
to
relieve
herself
from
her
just
liabilities
by
such
a
treaty
our
citizens
who
hold
just
demands
against
her
would
have
no
remedy
either
against
mexico
or
their
own
government
our
duty
to
these
citizens
must
forever
prevent
such
a
peace
and
no
treaty
which
does
not
provide
ample
means
of
discharging
these
demands
can
receive
my
sanction
a
treaty
of
peace
should
settle
all
existing
differences
between
the
two
countries
if
an
adequate
cession
of
territory
should
be
made
by
such
a
treaty
the
united
states
should
release
mexico
from
all
her
liabilities
and
assume
their
payment
to
our
own
citizens
if
instead
of
this
the
united
states
were
to
consent
to
a
treaty
by
which
mexico
should
again
engage
to
pay
the
heavy
amount
of
indebtedness
which
a
just
indemnity
to
our
government
and
our
citizens
would
impose
on
her
it
is
notorious
that
she
does
not
possess
the
means
to
meet
such
an
undertaking
from
such
a
treaty
no
result
could
be
anticipated
but
the
same
irritating
disappointments
which
have
heretofore
attended
the
violations
of
similar
treaty
stipulations
on
the
part
of
mexico
such
a
treaty
would
be
but
a
temporary
cessation
of
hostilities
without
the
restoration
of
the
friendship
and
good
understanding
which
should
characterize
the
future
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
that
congress
contemplated
the
acquisition
of
territorial
indemnity
when
that
body
made
provision
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
is
obvious
congress
could
not
have
meant
when
in
may
they
appropriated
and
authorized
the
president
to
employ
the
militia
and
naval
and
military
forces
of
the
united
states
and
to
accept
the
services
of
volunteers
to
enable
him
to
prosecute
the
war
and
when
at
their
last
session
and
after
our
army
had
invaded
mexico
they
made
additional
appropriations
and
authorized
the
raising
of
additional
troops
for
the
same
purpose
that
no
indemnity
was
to
be
obtained
from
mexico
at
the
conclusion
of
the
war
and
yet
it
was
certain
that
if
no
mexican
territory
was
acquired
no
indemnity
could
be
obtained
it
is
further
manifest
that
congress
contemplated
territorial
indemnity
from
the
fact
that
at
their
last
session
an
act
was
passed
upon
the
executive
recommendation
appropriating
with
that
express
object
this
appropriation
was
made
to
enable
the
president
to
conclude
a
treaty
of
peace
limits
and
boundaries
with
the
republic
of
mexico
to
be
used
by
him
in
the
event
that
said
treaty
when
signed
by
the
authorized
agents
of
the
two
governments
and
duly
ratified
by
mexico
shall
call
for
the
expenditure
of
the
same
or
any
part
thereof
the
object
of
asking
this
appropriation
was
distinctly
stated
in
the
several
messages
on
the
subject
which
i
communicated
to
congress
similar
appropriations
made
in
and
which
were
referred
to
were
intended
to
be
applied
in
part
consideration
for
the
cession
of
louisiana
and
the
floridas
in
like
manner
it
was
anticipated
that
in
settling
the
terms
of
a
treaty
of
limits
and
boundaries
with
mexico
a
cession
of
territory
estimated
to
be
of
greater
value
than
the
amount
of
our
demands
against
her
might
be
obtained
and
that
the
prompt
payment
of
this
sum
in
part
consideration
for
the
territory
ceded
on
the
conclusion
of
a
treaty
and
its
ratification
on
her
part
might
be
an
inducement
with
her
to
make
such
a
cession
of
territory
as
would
be
satisfactory
to
the
united
states
and
although
the
failure
to
conclude
such
a
treaty
has
rendered
it
unnecessary
to
use
any
part
of
the
appropriated
by
that
act
and
the
entire
sum
remains
in
the
treasury
it
is
still
applicable
to
that
object
should
the
contingency
occur
making
such
application
proper
the
doctrine
of
no
territory
is
the
doctrine
of
no
indemnity
and
if
sanctioned
would
be
a
public
acknowledgment
that
our
country
was
wrong
and
that
the
war
declared
by
congress
with
extraordinary
unanimity
was
unjust
and
should
be
abandonedan
admission
unfounded
in
fact
and
degrading
to
the
national
character
the
terms
of
the
treaty
proposed
by
the
united
states
were
not
only
just
to
mexico
but
considering
the
character
and
amount
of
our
claims
the
unjustifiable
and
unprovoked
commencement
of
hostilities
by
her
the
expenses
of
the
war
to
which
we
have
been
subjected
and
the
success
which
had
attended
our
arms
were
deemed
to
be
of
a
most
liberal
character
the
commissioner
of
the
united
states
was
authorized
to
agree
to
the
establishment
of
the
rio
grande
as
the
boundary
from
its
entrance
into
the
gulf
to
its
intersection
with
the
southern
boundary
of
new
mexico
in
north
latitude
about
degree
and
to
obtain
a
cession
to
the
united
states
of
the
provinces
of
new
mexico
and
the
californias
and
the
privilege
of
the
right
of
way
across
the
isthmus
of
tehuantepec
the
boundary
of
the
rio
grande
and
the
cession
to
the
united
states
of
new
mexico
and
upper
california
constituted
an
ultimatum
which
our
commissioner
was
under
no
circumstances
to
yield
that
it
might
be
manifest
not
only
to
mexico
but
to
all
other
nations
that
the
united
states
were
not
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
a
feeble
power
by
insisting
upon
wrestling
from
her
all
the
other
provinces
including
many
of
her
principal
towns
and
cities
which
we
had
conquered
and
held
in
our
military
occupation
but
were
willing
to
conclude
a
treaty
in
a
spirit
of
liberality
our
commissioner
was
authorized
to
stipulate
for
the
restoration
to
mexico
of
all
our
other
conquests
as
the
territory
to
be
acquired
by
the
boundary
proposed
might
be
estimated
to
be
of
greater
value
than
a
fair
equivalent
for
our
just
demands
our
commissioner
was
authorized
to
stipulate
for
the
payment
of
such
additional
pecuniary
consideration
as
was
deemed
reasonable
the
terms
of
a
treaty
proposed
by
the
mexican
commissioners
were
wholly
inadmissible
they
negotiated
as
if
mexico
were
the
victorious
and
not
the
vanquished
party
they
must
have
known
that
their
ultimatum
could
never
be
accepted
it
required
the
united
states
to
dismember
texas
by
surrendering
to
mexico
that
part
of
the
territory
of
that
state
lying
between
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
included
within
her
limits
by
her
laws
when
she
was
an
independent
republic
and
when
she
was
annexed
to
the
united
states
and
admitted
by
congress
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union
it
contained
no
provision
for
the
payment
by
mexico
of
the
just
claims
of
our
citizens
it
required
indemnity
to
mexican
citizens
for
injuries
they
may
have
sustained
by
our
troops
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
it
demanded
the
right
for
mexico
to
levy
and
collect
the
mexican
tariff
of
duties
on
goods
imported
into
her
ports
while
in
our
military
occupation
during
the
war
and
the
owners
of
which
had
paid
to
officers
of
the
united
states
the
military
contributions
which
had
been
levied
upon
them
and
it
offered
to
cede
to
the
united
states
for
a

pecuniary
consideration
that
part
of
upper
california
lying
north
of
latitude
such
were
the
unreasonable
terms
proposed
by
the
mexican
commissioners
the
cession
to
the
united
states
by
mexico
of
the
provinces
of
new
mexico
and
the
californias
as
proposed
by
the
commissioner
of
the
united
states
it
was
believed
would
be
more
in
accordance
with
the
convenience
and
interests
of
both
nations
than
any
other
cession
of
territory
which
it
was
probable
mexico
could
be
induced
to
make
it
is
manifest
to
all
who
have
observed
the
actual
condition
of
the
mexican
government
for
some
years
past
and
at
present
that
if
these
provinces
should
be
retained
by
her
she
could
not
long
continue
to
hold
and
govern
them
mexico
is
too
feeble
a
power
to
govern
these
provinces
lying
as
they
do
at
a
distance
of
more
than
miles
from
her
capital
and
if
attempted
to
be
retained
by
her
they
would
constitute
but
for
a
short
time
even
nominally
a
part
of
her
dominions
this
would
be
especially
the
case
with
upper
california
the
sagacity
of
powerful
european
nations
has
long
since
directed
their
attention
to
the
commercial
importance
of
that
province
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
moment
the
united
states
shall
relinquish
their
present
occupation
of
it
and
their
claim
to
it
as
indemnity
an
effort
would
be
made
by
some
foreign
power
to
possess
it
either
by
conquest
or
by
purchase
if
no
foreign
government
should
acquire
it
in
either
of
these
modes
an
independent
revolutionary
government
would
probably
be
established
by
the
inhabitants
and
such
foreigners
as
may
remain
in
or
remove
to
the
country
as
soon
as
it
shall
be
known
that
the
united
states
have
abandoned
it
such
a
government
would
be
too
feeble
long
to
maintain
its
separate
independent
existence
and
would
finally
become
annexed
to
or
be
a
dependent
colony
of
some
more
powerful
state
should
any
foreign
government
attempt
to
possess
it
as
a
colony
or
otherwise
to
incorporate
it
with
itself
the
principle
avowed
by
president
monroe
in
and
reaffirmed
in
my
first
annual
message
that
no
foreign
power
shall
with
our
consent
be
permitted
to
plant
or
establish
any
new
colony
or
dominion
on
any
part
of
the
north
american
continent
must
be
maintained
in
maintaining
this
principle
and
in
resisting
its
invasion
by
any
foreign
power
we
might
be
involved
in
other
wars
more
expensive
and
more
difficult
than
that
in
which
we
are
now
engaged
the
provinces
of
new
mexico
and
the
californias
are
contiguous
to
the
territories
of
the
united
states
and
if
brought
under
the
government
of
our
laws
their
resourcesmineral
agricultural
manufacturing
and
commercialwould
soon
be
developed
upper
california
is
bounded
on
the
north
by
our
oregon
possessions
and
if
held
by
the
united
states
would
soon
be
settled
by
a
hardy
enterprising
and
intelligent
portion
of
our
population
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
other
harbors
along
the
californian
coast
would
afford
shelter
for
our
navy
for
our
numerous
whale
ships
and
other
merchant
vessels
employed
in
the
pacific
ocean
and
would
in
a
short
period
become
the
marts
of
an
extensive
and
profitable
commerce
with
china
and
other
countries
of
the
east
these
advantages
in
which
the
whole
commercial
world
would
participate
would
at
once
be
secured
to
the
united
states
by
the
cession
of
this
territory
while
it
is
certain
that
as
long
as
it
remains
a
part
of
the
mexican
dominions
they
can
be
enjoyed
neither
by
mexico
herself
nor
by
any
other
nation
new
mexico
is
a
frontier
province
and
has
never
been
of
any
considerable
value
to
mexico
from
its
locality
it
is
naturally
connected
with
our
western
settlements
the
territorial
limits
of
the
state
of
texas
too
as
defined
by
her
laws
before
her
admission
into
our
union
embrace
all
that
portion
of
new
mexico
lying
east
of
the
rio
grande
while
mexico
still
claims
to
hold
this
territory
as
a
part
of
her
dominions
the
adjustment
of
this
question
of
boundary
is
important
there
is
another
consideration
which
induced
the
belief
that
the
mexican
government
might
even
desire
to
place
this
province
under
the
protection
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
numerous
bands
of
fierce
and
warlike
savages
wander
over
it
and
upon
its
borders
mexico
has
been
and
must
continue
to
be
too
feeble
to
restrain
them
from
committing
depredations
robberies
and
murders
not
only
upon
the
inhabitants
of
new
mexico
itself
but
upon
those
of
the
other
northern
states
of
mexico
it
would
be
a
blessing
to
all
these
northern
states
to
have
their
citizens
protected
against
them
by
the
power
of
the
united
states
at
this
moment
many
mexicans
principally
females
and
children
are
in
captivity
among
them
if
new
mexico
were
held
and
governed
by
the
united
states
we
could
effectually
prevent
these
tribes
from
committing
such
outrages
and
compel
them
to
release
these
captives
and
restore
them
to
their
families
and
friends
in
proposing
to
acquire
new
mexico
and
the
californias
it
was
known
that
but
an
inconsiderable
portion
of
the
mexican
people
would
be
transferred
with
them
the
country
embraced
within
these
provinces
being
chiefly
an
uninhabited
region
these
were
the
leading
considerations
which
induced
me
to
authorize
the
terms
of
peace
which
were
proposed
to
mexico
they
were
rejected
and
negotiations
being
at
an
end
hostilities
were
renewed
an
assault
was
made
by
our
gallant
army
upon
the
strongly
fortified
places
near
the
gates
of
the
city
of
mexico
and
upon
the
city
itself
and
after
several
days
of
severe
conflict
the
mexican
forces
vastly
superior
in
number
to
our
own
were
driven
from
the
city
and
it
was
occupied
by
our
troops
immediately
after
information
was
received
of
the
unfavorable
result
of
the
negotiations
believing
that
his
continued
presence
with
the
army
could
be
productive
of
no
good
i
determined
to
recall
our
commissioner
a
dispatch
to
this
effect
was
transmitted
to
him
on
the
th
of
october
last
the
mexican
government
will
be
informed
of
his
recall
and
that
in
the
existing
state
of
things
i
shall
not
deem
it
proper
to
make
any
further
overtures
of
peace
but
shall
be
at
all
times
ready
to
receive
and
consider
any
proposals
which
may
be
made
by
mexico
since
the
liberal
proposition
of
the
united
states
was
authorized
to
be
made
in
april
last
large
expenditures
have
been
incurred
and
the
precious
blood
of
many
of
our
patriotic
fellowcitizens
has
been
shed
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
this
consideration
and
the
obstinate
perseverance
of
mexico
in
protracting
the
war
must
influence
the
terms
of
peace
which
it
may
be
deemed
proper
hereafter
to
accept
our
arms
having
been
everywhere
victorious
having
subjected
to
our
military
occupation
a
large
portion
of
the
enemys
country
including
his
capital
and
negotiations
for
peace
having
failed
the
important
questions
arise
in
what
manner
the
war
ought
to
be
prosecuted
and
what
should
be
our
future
policy
i
can
not
doubt
that
we
should
secure
and
render
available
the
conquests
which
we
have
already
made
and
that
with
this
view
we
should
hold
and
occupy
by
our
naval
and
military
forces
all
the
ports
towns
cities
and
provinces
now
in
our
occupation
or
which
may
hereafter
fall
into
our
possession
that
we
should
press
forward
our
military
operations
and
levy
such
military
contributions
on
the
enemy
as
may
as
far
as
practicable
defray
the
future
expenses
of
the
war
had
the
government
of
mexico
acceded
to
the
equitable
and
liberal
terms
proposed
that
mode
of
adjustment
would
have
been
preferred
mexico
having
declined
to
do
this
and
failed
to
offer
any
other
terms
which
could
be
accepted
by
the
united
states
the
national
honor
no
less
than
the
public
interests
requires
that
the
war
should
be
prosecuted
with
increased
energy
and
power
until
a
just
and
satisfactory
peace
can
be
obtained
in
the
meantime
as
mexico
refuses
all
indemnity
we
should
adopt
measures
to
indemnify
ourselves
by
appropriating
permanently
a
portion
of
her
territory
early
after
the
commencement
of
the
war
new
mexico
and
the
californias
were
taken
possession
of
by
our
forces
our
military
and
naval
commanders
were
ordered
to
conquer
and
hold
them
subject
to
be
disposed
of
by
a
treaty
of
peace
these
provinces
are
now
in
our
undisputed
occupation
and
have
been
so
for
many
months
all
resistance
on
the
part
of
mexico
having
ceased
within
their
limits
i
am
satisfied
that
they
should
never
be
surrendered
to
mexico
should
congress
concur
with
me
in
this
opinion
and
that
they
should
be
retained
by
the
united
states
as
indemnity
i
can
perceive
no
good
reason
why
the
civil
jurisdiction
and
laws
of
the
united
states
should
not
at
once
be
extended
over
them
to
wait
for
a
treaty
of
peace
such
as
we
are
willing
to
make
by
which
our
relations
toward
them
would
not
be
changed
can
not
be
good
policy
whilst
our
own
interest
and
that
of
the
people
inhabiting
them
require
that
a
stable
responsible
and
free
government
under
our
authority
should
as
soon
as
possible
be
established
over
them
should
congress
therefore
determine
to
hold
these
provinces
permanently
and
that
they
shall
hereafter
be
considered
as
constituent
parts
of
our
country
the
early
establishment
of
territorial
governments
over
them
will
be
important
for
the
more
perfect
protection
of
persons
and
property
and
i
recommend
that
such
territorial
governments
be
established
it
will
promote
peace
and
tranquillity
among
the
inhabitants
by
allaying
all
apprehension
that
they
may
still
entertain
of
being
again
subjected
to
the
jurisdiction
of
mexico
i
invite
the
early
and
favorable
consideration
of
congress
to
this
important
subject
besides
new
mexico
and
the
californias
there
are
other
mexican
provinces
which
have
been
reduced
to
our
possession
by
conquest
these
other
mexican
provinces
are
now
governed
by
our
military
and
naval
commanders
under
the
general
authority
which
is
conferred
upon
a
conqueror
by
the
laws
of
war
they
should
continue
to
be
held
as
a
means
of
coercing
mexico
to
accede
to
just
terms
of
peace
civil
as
well
as
military
officers
are
required
to
conduct
such
a
government
adequate
compensation
to
be
drawn
from
contr
ibutions
levied
on
the
enemy
should
be
fixed
by
law
for
such
officers
as
may
be
thus
employed
what
further
provision
may
become
necessary
and
what
final
disposition
it
may
be
proper
to
make
of
them
must
depend
on
the
future
progress
of
the
war
and
the
course
which
mexico
may
think
proper
hereafter
to
pursue
with
the
views
i
entertain
i
can
not
favor
the
policy
which
has
been
suggested
either
to
withdraw
our
army
altogether
or
to
retire
to
a
designated
line
and
simply
hold
and
defend
it
to
withdraw
our
army
altogether
from
the
conquests
they
have
made
by
deeds
of
unparalleled
bravery
and
at
the
expense
of
so
much
blood
and
treasure
in
a
just
war
on
our
part
and
one
which
by
the
act
of
the
enemy
we
could
not
honorably
have
avoided
would
be
to
degrade
the
nation
in
its
own
estimation
and
in
that
of
the
world
to
retire
to
a
line
and
simply
hold
and
defend
it
would
not
terminate
the
war
on
the
contrary
it
would
encourage
mexico
to
persevere
and
tend
to
protract
it
indefinitely
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
mexico
after
refusing
to
establish
such
a
line
as
a
permanent
boundary
when
our
victorious
army
are
in
possession
of
her
capital
and
in
the
heart
of
her
country
would
permit
us
to
hold
it
without
resistance
that
she
would
continue
the
war
and
in
the
most
harassing
and
annoying
forms
there
can
be
no
doubt
a
border
warfare
of
the
most
savage
character
extending
over
a
long
line
would
be
unceasingly
waged
it
would
require
a
large
army
to
be
kept
constantly
in
the
field
stationed
at
posts
and
garrisons
along
such
a
line
to
protect
and
defend
it
the
enemy
relieved
from
the
pressure
of
our
arms
on
his
coasts
and
in
the
populous
parts
of
the
interior
would
direct
his
attention
to
this
line
and
selecting
an
isolated
post
for
attack
would
concentrate
his
forces
upon
it
this
would
be
a
condition
of
affairs
which
the
mexicans
pursuing
their
favorite
system
of
guerrilla
warfare
would
probably
prefer
to
any
other
were
we
to
assume
a
defensive
attitude
on
such
a
line
all
the
advantages
of
such
a
state
of
war
would
be
on
the
side
of
the
enemy
we
could
levy
no
contributions
upon
him
or
in
any
other
way
make
him
feel
the
pressure
of
the
war
but
must
remain
inactive
and
await
his
approach
being
in
constant
uncertainty
at
what
point
on
the
line
or
at
what
time
he
might
make
an
assault
he
may
assemble
and
organize
an
overwhelming
force
in
the
interior
on
his
own
side
of
the
line
and
concealing
his
purpose
make
a
sudden
assault
upon
some
one
of
our
posts
so
distant
from
any
other
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
timely
succor
or
reenforcements
and
in
this
way
our
gallant
army
would
be
exposed
to
the
danger
of
being
cut
off
in
detail
or
if
by
their
unequaled
bravery
and
prowess
everywhere
exhibited
during
this
war
they
should
repulse
the
enemy
their
numbers
stationed
at
any
one
post
may
be
too
small
to
pursue
him
if
the
enemy
be
repulsed
in
one
attack
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
retreat
to
his
own
side
of
the
line
and
being
in
no
fear
of
a
pursuing
army
may
reenforce
himself
at
leisure
for
another
attack
on
the
same
or
some
other
post
he
may
too
cross
the
line
between
our
posts
make
rapid
incursions
into
the
country
which
we
hold
murder
the
inhabitants
commit
depredations
on
them
and
then
retreat
to
the
interior
before
a
sufficient
force
can
be
concentrated
to
pursue
him
such
would
probably
be
the
harassing
character
of
a
mere
defensive
war
on
our
part
if
our
forces
when
attacked
or
threatened
with
attack
be
permitted
to
cross
the
line
drive
back
the
enemy
and
conquer
him
this
would
be
again
to
invade
the
enemys
country
after
having
lost
all
the
advantages
of
the
conquests
we
have
already
made
by
having
voluntarily
abandoned
them
to
hold
such
a
line
successfully
and
in
security
it
is
far
from
being
certain
that
it
would
not
require
as
large
an
army
as
would
be
necessary
to
hold
all
the
conquests
we
have
already
made
and
to
continue
the
prosecution
of
the
war
in
the
heart
of
the
enemys
country
it
is
also
far
from
being
certain
that
the
expenses
of
the
war
would
be
diminished
by
such
a
policy
i
am
persuaded
that
the
best
means
of
vindicating
the
national
honor
and
interest
and
of
bringing
the
war
to
an
honorable
close
will
be
to
prosecute
it
with
increased
energy
and
power
in
the
vital
parts
of
the
enemys
country
in
my
annual
message
to
congress
of
december
last
i
declared
that
the
war
has
not
been
waged
with
a
view
to
conquest
but
having
been
commenced
by
mexico
it
has
been
carried
into
the
enemys
country
and
will
be
vigorously
prosecuted
there
with
a
view
to
obtain
an
honorable
peace
and
thereby
secure
ample
indemnity
for
the
expenses
of
the
war
as
well
as
to
our
muchinjured
citizens
who
hold
large
pecuniary
demands
against
mexico
such
in
my
judgment
continues
to
be
our
true
policy
indeed
the
only
policy
which
will
probably
secure
a
permanent
peace
it
has
never
been
contemplated
by
me
as
an
object
of
the
war
to
make
a
permanent
conquest
of
the
republic
of
mexico
or
to
annihilate
her
separate
existence
as
an
independent
nation
on
the
contrary
it
has
ever
been
my
desire
that
she
should
maintain
her
nationality
and
under
a
good
government
adapted
to
her
condition
be
a
free
independent
and
prosperous
republic
the
united
states
were
the
first
among
the
nations
to
recognize
her
independence
and
have
always
desired
to
be
on
terms
of
amity
and
good
neighborhood
with
her
this
she
would
not
suffer
by
her
own
conduct
we
have
been
compelled
to
engage
in
the
present
war
in
its
prosecution
we
seek
not
her
overthrow
as
a
nation
but
in
vindicating
our
national
honor
we
seek
to
obtain
redress
for
the
wrongs
she
has
done
us
and
indemnity
for
our
just
demands
against
her
we
demand
an
honorable
peace
and
that
peace
must
bring
with
it
indemnity
for
the
past
and
security
for
the
future
hitherto
mexico
has
refused
all
accommodation
by
which
such
a
peace
could
be
obtained
whilst
our
armies
have
advanced
from
victory
to
victory
from
the
commencement
of
the
war
it
has
always
been
with
the
olive
branch
of
peace
in
their
hands
and
it
has
been
in
the
power
of
mexico
at
every
step
to
arrest
hostilities
by
accepting
it
one
great
obstacle
to
the
attainment
of
peace
has
undoubtedly
arisen
from
the
fact
that
mexico
has
been
so
long
held
in
subjection
by
one
faction
or
military
usurper
after
another
and
such
has
been
the
condition
of
insecurity
in
which
their
successive
governments
have
been
placed
that
each
has
been
deterred
from
making
peace
lest
for
this
very
cause
a
rival
faction
might
expel
it
from
power
such
was
the
fate
of
president
herreras
administration
in
for
being
disposed
even
to
listen
to
the
overtures
of
the
united
states
to
prevent
the
war
as
is
fully
confirmed
by
an
official
correspondence
which
took
place
in
the
month
of
august
last
between
him
and
his
government
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
communicated
for
this
cause
alone
the
revolution
which
displaced
him
from
power
was
set
on
foot
by
general
paredes
such
may
be
the
condition
of
insecurity
of
the
present
government
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
peaceable
and
welldisposed
inhabitants
of
mexico
are
convinced
that
it
is
the
true
interest
of
their
country
to
conclude
an
honorable
peace
with
the
united
states
but
the
apprehension
of
becoming
the
victims
of
some
military
faction
or
usurper
may
have
prevented
them
from
manifesting
their
feelings
by
any
public
act
the
removal
of
any
such
apprehension
would
probably
cause
them
to
speak
their
sentiments
freely
and
to
adopt
the
measures
necessary
for
the
restoration
of
peace
with
a
people
distracted
and
divided
by
contending
factions
and
a
government
subject
to
constant
changes
by
successive
revolutions
the
continued
successes
of
our
arms
may
fail
to
secure
a
satisfactory
peace
in
such
event
it
may
become
proper
for
our
commanding
generals
in
the
field
to
give
encouragement
and
assurances
of
protection
to
the
friends
of
peace
in
mexico
in
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
a
free
republican
government
of
their
own
choice
able
and
willing
to
conclude
a
peace
which
would
be
just
to
them
and
secure
to
us
the
indemnity
we
demand
this
may
become
the
only
mode
of
obtaining
such
a
peace
should
such
be
the
result
the
war
which
mexico
has
forced
upon
us
would
thus
be
converted
into
an
enduring
blessing
to
herself
after
finding
her
torn
and
distracted
by
factions
and
ruled
by
military
usurpers
we
should
then
leave
her
with
a
republican
government
in
the
enjoyment
of
real
independence
and
domestic
peace
and
prosperity
performing
all
her
relative
duties
in
the
great
family
of
nations
and
promoting
her
own
happiness
by
wise
laws
and
their
faithful
execution
if
after
affording
this
encouragement
and
protection
and
after
all
the
persevering
and
sincere
efforts
we
have
made
from
the
moment
mexico
commenced
the
war
and
prior
to
that
time
to
adjust
our
differences
with
her
we
shall
ultimately
fail
then
we
shall
have
exhausted
all
honorable
means
in
pursuit
of
peace
and
must
continue
to
occupy
her
country
with
our
troops
taking
the
full
measure
of
indemnity
into
our
own
hands
and
must
enforce
the
terms
which
our
honor
demands
to
act
otherwise
in
the
existing
state
of
things
in
mexico
and
to
withdraw
our
army
without
a
peace
would
not
only
leave
all
the
wrongs
of
which
we
complain
unredressed
but
would
be
the
signal
for
new
and
fierce
civil
dissensions
and
new
revolutionsall
alike
hostile
to
peaceful
relations
with
the
united
states
besides
there
is
danger
if
our
troops
were
withdrawn
before
a
peace
was
conducted
that
the
mexican
people
wearied
with
successive
revolutions
and
deprived
of
protection
for
their
persons
and
property
might
at
length
be
inclined
to
yield
to
foreign
influences
and
to
cast
themselves
into
the
arms
of
some
european
monarch
for
protection
from
the
anarchy
and
suffering
which
would
ensue
this
for
our
own
safety
and
in
pursuance
of
our
established
policy
we
should
be
compelled
to
resist
we
could
never
consent
that
mexico
should
be
thus
converted
into
a
monarchy
governed
by
a
foreign
prince
mexico
is
our
near
neighbor
and
her
boundaries
are
coter
minous
with
our
own
through
the
whole
extent
across
the
north
american
continent
from
ocean
to
ocean
both
politically
and
commercially
we
have
the
deepest
interest
in
her
regeneration
and
prosperity
indeed
it
is
impossible
that
with
any
just
regard
to
our
own
safety
we
can
ever
become
indifferent
to
her
fate
it
may
be
that
the
mexican
government
and
people
have
misconstrued
or
misunderstood
our
forbearance
and
our
objects
in
desiring
to
conclude
an
amicable
adjustment
of
the
existing
differences
between
the
two
countries
they
may
have
supposed
that
we
would
submit
to
terms
degrading
to
the
nation
or
they
may
have
drawn
false
inferences
from
the
supposed
division
of
opinion
in
the
united
states
on
the
subject
of
the
war
and
may
have
calculated
to
gain
much
by
protracting
it
and
indeed
that
we
might
ultimately
abandon
it
altogether
without
insisting
on
any
indemnity
territorial
or
otherwise
whatever
may
be
the
false
impressions
under
which
they
have
acted
the
adoption
and
prosecution
of
the
energetic
policy
proposed
must
soon
undeceive
them
in
the
future
prosecution
of
the
war
the
enemy
must
be
made
to
feel
its
pressure
more
than
they
have
heretofore
done
at
its
commencement
it
was
deemed
proper
to
conduct
it
in
a
spirit
of
forbearance
and
liberality
with
this
end
in
view
early
measures
were
adopted
to
conciliate
as
far
as
a
state
of
war
would
permit
the
mass
of
the
mexican
population
to
convince
them
that
the
war
was
waged
not
against
the
peaceful
inhabitants
of
mexico
but
against
their
faithless
government
which
had
commenced
hostilities
to
remove
from
their
minds
the
false
impressions
which
their
designing
and
interested
rulers
had
artfully
attempted
to
make
that
the
war
on
our
part
was
one
of
conquest
that
it
was
a
war
against
their
religion
and
their
churches
which
were
to
be
desecrated
and
overthrown
and
that
their
rights
of
person
and
private
property
would
be
violated
to
remove
these
false
impressions
our
commanders
in
the
field
were
directed
scrupulously
to
respect
their
religion
their
churches
and
their
church
property
which
were
in
no
manner
to
be
violated
they
were
directed
also
to
respect
the
rights
of
persons
and
property
of
all
who
should
not
take
up
arms
against
us
assurances
to
this
effect
were
given
to
the
mexican
people
by
major
general
taylor
in
a
proclamation
issued
in
pursuance
of
instructions
from
the
secretary
of
war
in
the
month
of
june
and
again
by
majorgeneral
scott
who
acted
upon
his
own
convictions
of
the
propriety
of
issuing
it
in
a
proclamation
of
the
th
of
may
in
this
spirit
of
liberality
and
conciliation
and
with
a
view
to
prevent
the
body
of
the
mexican
population
from
taking
up
arms
against
us
was
the
war
conducted
on
our
part
provisions
and
other
supplies
furnished
to
our
army
by
mexican
citizens
were
paid
for
at
fair
and
liberal
prices
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
months
it
became
apparent
that
these
assurances
and
this
mild
treatment
had
failed
to
produce
the
desired
effect
upon
the
mexican
population
while
the
war
had
been
conducted
on
our
part
according
to
the
most
humane
and
liberal
principles
observed
by
civilized
nations
it
was
waged
in
a
far
different
spirit
on
the
part
of
mexico
not
appreciating
our
forbearance
the
mexican
people
generally
became
hostile
to
the
united
states
and
availed
themselves
of
every
opportunity
to
commit
the
most
savage
excesses
upon
our
troops
large
numbers
of
the
population
took
up
arms
and
engaging
in
guerrilla
warfare
robbed
and
murdered
in
the
most
cruel
manner
individual
soldiers
or
small
parties
whom
accident
or
other
causes
had
separated
from
the
main
body
of
our
army
bands
of
guerrilleros
and
robbers
infested
the
roads
harassed
our
trains
and
whenever
it
was
in
their
power
cut
off
our
supplies
the
mexicans
having
thus
shown
themselves
to
be
wholly
incapable
of
appreciating
our
forbearance
and
liberality
it
was
deemed
proper
to
change
the
manner
of
conducting
the
war
by
making
them
feel
its
pressure
according
to
the
usages
observed
under
similar
circumstances
by
all
other
civilized
nations
accordingly
as
early
as
the
d
of
september
instructions
were
given
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
majorgeneral
taylor
to
draw
supplies
for
our
army
from
the
enemy
without
paying
for
them
and
to
require
contributions
for
its
support
if
in
that
way
he
was
satisfied
he
could
get
abundant
supplies
for
his
forces
in
directing
the
execution
of
these
instructions
much
was
necessarily
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
commanding
officer
who
was
best
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
by
which
he
was
surrounded
the
wants
of
the
army
and
the
practicability
of
enforcing
the
measure
general
taylor
on
the
th
of
october
replied
from
monterey
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
hitherto
and
is
so
now
to
sustain
the
army
to
any
extent
by
forced
contributions
of
money
or
supplies
for
the
reasons
assigned
by
him
he
did
not
adopt
the
policy
of
his
instructions
but
declared
his
readiness
to
do
so
should
the
army
in
its
future
operations
reach
a
portion
of
the
country
which
may
be
made
to
supply
the
troops
with
advantage
he
continued
to
pay
for
the
articles
of
supply
which
were
drawn
from
the
enemys
country
similar
instructions
were
issued
to
majorgeneral
scott
on
the
d
of
april
who
replied
from
jalapa
on
the
th
of
may
that
if
it
be
expected
that
the
army
is
to
support
itself
by
forced
contributions
levied
upon
the
country
we
may
ruin
and
exasperate
the
inhabitants
and
starve
ourselves
the
same
discretion
was
given
to
him
that
had
been
to
general
taylor
in
this
respect
general
scott
for
the
reasons
assigned
by
him
also
continued
to
pay
for
the
articles
of
supply
for
the
army
which
were
drawn
from
the
enemy
after
the
army
had
reached
the
heart
of
the
most
wealthy
portion
of
mexico
it
was
supposed
that
the
obstacles
which
had
before
that
time
prevented
it
would
not
be
such
as
to
render
impracticable
the
levy
of
forced
contributions
for
its
support
and
on
the
st
of
september
and
again
on
the
th
of
october
the
order
was
repeated
in
dispatches
addressed
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
general
scott
and
his
attention
was
again
called
to
the
importance
of
making
the
enemy
bear
the
burdens
of
the
war
by
requiring
them
to
furnish
the
means
of
supporting
our
army
and
he
was
directed
to
adopt
this
policy
unless
by
doing
so
there
was
danger
of
depriving
the
army
of
the
necessary
supplies
copies
of
these
dispatches
were
forwarded
to
general
taylor
for
his
government
on
the
st
of
march
last
i
caused
an
order
to
be
issued
to
our
military
and
naval
commanders
to
levy
and
collect
a
military
contribution
upon
all
vessels
and
merchandise
which
might
enter
any
of
the
ports
of
mexico
in
our
military
occupation
and
to
apply
such
contributions
toward
defraying
the
expenses
of
the
war
by
virtue
of
the
right
of
conquest
and
the
laws
of
war
the
conqueror
consulting
his
own
safety
or
convenience
may
either
exclude
foreign
commerce
altogether
from
all
such
ports
or
permit
it
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
he
may
prescribe
before
the
principal
ports
of
mexico
were
blockaded
by
our
navy
the
revenue
derived
from
import
duties
under
the
laws
of
mexico
was
paid
into
the
mexican
treasury
after
these
ports
had
fallen
into
our
military
possession
the
blockade
was
raised
and
commerce
with
them
permitted
upon
prescribed
terms
and
conditions
they
were
opened
to
the
trade
of
all
nations
upon
the
payment
of
duties
more
moderate
in
their
amount
than
those
which
had
been
previously
levied
by
mexico
and
the
revenue
which
was
formerly
paid
into
the
mexican
treasury
was
directed
to
be
collected
by
our
military
and
naval
officers
and
applied
to
the
use
of
our
army
and
navy
care
was
taken
that
the
officers
soldiers
and
sailors
of
our
army
and
navy
should
be
exempted
from
the
operations
of
the
order
and
as
the
merchandise
imported
upon
which
the
order
operated
must
be
consumed
by
mexican
citizens
the
contributions
exacted
were
in
effect
the
seizure
of
the
public
revenues
of
mexico
and
the
application
of
them
to
our
own
use
in
directing
this
measure
the
object
was
to
compel
the
enemy
to
contribute
as
far
as
practicable
toward
the
expenses
of
the
war
for
the
amount
of
contributions
which
have
been
levied
in
this
form
i
refer
you
to
the
accompanying
reports
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
by
which
it
appears
that
a
sum
exceeding
half
a
million
of
dollars
has
been
collected
this
amount
would
undoubtedly
have
been
much
larger
but
for
the
difficulty
of
keeping
open
communications
between
the
coast
and
the
interior
so
as
to
enable
the
owners
of
the
merchandise
imported
to
transport
and
vend
it
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
it
is
confidently
expected
that
this
difficulty
will
to
a
great
extent
be
soon
removed
by
our
increased
forces
which
have
been
sent
to
the
field
measures
have
recently
been
adopted
by
which
the
internal
as
well
as
the
external
revenues
of
mexico
in
all
places
in
our
military
occupation
will
be
seized
and
appropriated
to
the
use
of
our
army
and
navy
the
policy
of
levying
upon
the
enemy
contributions
in
every
form
consistently
with
the
laws
of
nations
which
it
may
be
practicable
for
our
military
commanders
to
adopt
should
in
my
judgment
be
rigidly
enforced
and
orders
to
this
effect
have
accordingly
been
given
by
such
a
policy
at
the
same
time
that
our
own
treasury
will
be
relieved
from
a
heavy
drain
the
mexican
people
will
be
made
to
feel
the
burdens
of
the
war
and
consulting
their
own
interests
may
be
induced
the
more
readily
to
require
their
rulers
to
accede
to
a
just
peace
after
the
adjournment
of
the
last
session
of
congress
events
transpired
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
which
in
my
judgment
required
a
greater
number
of
troops
in
the
field
than
had
been
anticipated
the
strength
of
the
army
was
accordingly
increased
by
accepting
the
services
of
all
the
volunteer
forces
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
may
without
putting
a
construction
on
that
act
the
correctness
of
which
was
seriously
questioned
the
volunteer
forces
now
in
the
field
with
those
which
had
been
acc
epted
to
serve
for
twelve
months
and
were
discharged
at
the
end
of
their
term
of
service
exhaust
the
men
authorized
by
that
act
had
it
been
clear
that
a
proper
construction
of
the
act
warranted
it
the
services
of
an
additional
number
would
have
been
called
for
and
accepted
but
doubts
existing
upon
this
point
the
power
was
not
exercised
it
is
deemed
important
that
congress
should
at
an
early
period
of
their
session
confer
the
authority
to
raise
an
additional
regular
force
to
serve
during
the
war
with
mexico
and
to
be
discharged
upon
the
conclusion
and
ratification
of
a
treaty
of
peace
i
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
views
presented
by
the
secretary
of
war
in
his
report
upon
this
subject
i
recommend
also
that
authority
be
given
by
law
to
call
for
and
accept
the
services
of
an
additional
number
of
volunteers
to
be
exercised
at
such
time
and
to
such
extent
as
the
emergencies
of
the
service
may
require
in
prosecuting
the
war
with
mexico
whilst
the
utmost
care
has
been
taken
to
avoid
every
just
cause
of
complaint
on
the
part
of
neutral
nations
and
none
has
been
given
liberal
privileges
have
been
granted
to
their
commerce
in
the
ports
of
the
enemy
in
our
military
occupation
the
difficulty
with
the
brazilian
government
which
at
one
time
threatened
to
interrupt
the
friendly
relations
between
the
two
countries
will
i
trust
be
speedily
adjusted
i
have
received
information
that
an
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
the
united
states
will
shortly
be
appointed
by
his
imperial
majesty
and
it
is
hoped
that
he
will
come
instructed
and
prepared
to
adjust
all
remaining
differences
between
the
two
governments
in
a
manner
acceptable
and
honorable
to
both
in
the
meantime
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
nothing
will
occur
to
interrupt
our
amicable
relations
with
brazil
it
has
been
my
constant
effort
to
maintain
and
cultivate
the
most
intimate
relations
of
friendship
with
all
the
independent
powers
of
south
america
and
this
policy
has
been
attended
with
the
happiest
results
it
is
true
that
the
settlement
and
payment
of
many
just
claims
of
american
citizens
against
these
nations
have
been
long
delayed
the
peculiar
position
in
which
they
have
been
placed
and
the
desire
on
the
part
of
my
predecessors
as
well
as
myself
to
grant
them
the
utmost
indulgence
have
hitherto
prevented
these
claims
from
being
urged
in
a
manner
demanded
by
strict
justice
the
time
has
arrived
when
they
ought
to
be
finally
adjusted
and
liquidated
and
efforts
are
now
making
for
that
purpose
it
is
proper
to
inform
you
that
the
government
of
peru
has
in
good
faith
paid
the
first
two
installments
of
the
indemnity
of
each
and
the
greater
portion
of
the
interest
due
thereon
in
execution
of
the
convention
between
that
government
and
the
united
states
the
ratifications
of
which
were
exchanged
at
lima
on
the
st
of
october
the
attorneygeneral
of
the
united
states
early
in
august
last
completed
the
adjudication
of
the
claims
under
this
convention
and
made
his
report
thereon
in
pursuance
of
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
the
sums
to
which
the
claimants
are
respectively
entitled
will
be
paid
on
demand
at
the
treasury
i
invite
the
early
attention
of
congress
to
the
present
condition
of
our
citizens
in
china
under
our
treaty
with
that
power
american
citizens
are
withdrawn
from
the
jurisdiction
whether
civil
or
criminal
of
the
chinese
government
and
placed
under
that
of
our
public
functionaries
in
that
country
by
these
alone
can
our
citizens
be
tried
and
punished
for
the
commission
of
any
crime
by
these
alone
can
questions
be
decided
between
them
involving
the
rights
of
persons
and
property
and
by
these
alone
can
contracts
be
enforced
into
which
they
may
have
entered
with
the
citizens
or
subjects
of
foreign
powers
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
united
states
lying
in
the
waters
of
the
five
ports
of
china
open
to
foreign
commerce
are
under
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
officers
of
their
own
government
until
congress
shall
establish
competent
tribunals
to
try
and
punish
crimes
and
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
civil
cases
in
china
american
citizens
there
are
subject
to
no
law
whatever
crimes
may
be
committed
with
impunity
and
debts
may
be
contracted
without
any
means
to
enforce
their
payment
inconveniences
have
already
resulted
from
the
omission
of
congress
to
legislate
upon
the
subject
and
still
greater
are
apprehended
the
british
authorities
in
china
have
already
complained
that
this
government
has
not
provided
for
the
punishment
of
crimes
or
the
enforcement
of
contracts
against
american
citizens
in
that
country
whilst
their
government
has
established
tribunals
by
which
an
american
citizen
can
recover
debts
due
from
british
subjects
accustomed
as
the
chinese
are
to
summary
justice
they
could
not
be
made
to
comprehend
why
criminals
who
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
should
escape
with
impunity
in
violation
of
treaty
obligations
whilst
the
punishment
of
a
chinese
who
had
committed
any
crime
against
an
american
citizen
would
be
rigorously
exacted
indeed
the
consequences
might
be
fatal
to
american
citizens
in
china
should
a
flagrant
crime
be
committed
by
any
one
of
them
upon
a
chinese
and
should
trial
and
punishment
not
follow
according
to
the
requisitions
of
the
treaty
this
might
disturb
if
not
destroy
our
friendly
relations
with
that
empire
and
cause
an
interruption
of
our
valuable
commerce
our
treaties
with
the
sublime
porte
tripoli
tunis
morocco
and
muscat
also
require
the
legislation
of
congress
to
carry
them
into
execution
though
the
necessity
for
immediate
action
may
not
be
so
urgent
as
in
regard
to
china
the
secretary
of
state
has
submitted
an
estimate
to
defray
the
expense
of
opening
diplomatic
relations
with
the
papal
states
the
interesting
political
events
now
in
progress
in
these
states
as
well
as
a
just
regard
to
our
commercial
interests
have
in
my
opinion
rendered
such
a
measure
highly
expedient
estimates
have
also
been
submitted
for
the
outfits
and
salaries
of
charges
daffaires
to
the
republics
of
bolivia
guatemala
and
ecuador
the
manifest
importance
of
cultivating
the
most
friendly
relations
with
all
the
independent
states
upon
this
continent
has
induced
me
to
recommend
appropriations
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
these
missions
i
recommend
to
congress
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
be
paid
to
the
spanish
government
for
the
purpose
of
distribution
among
the
claimants
in
the
amistad
case
i
entertain
the
conviction
that
this
is
due
to
spain
under
the
treaty
of
the
th
of
october
and
moreover
that
from
the
earnest
manner
in
which
the
claim
continues
to
be
urged
so
long
as
it
shall
remain
unsettled
it
will
be
a
source
of
irritation
and
discord
between
the
two
countries
which
may
prove
highly
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
the
united
states
good
policy
no
less
than
a
faithful
compliance
with
our
treaty
obligations
requires
that
the
inconsiderable
appropriation
demanded
should
be
made
a
detailed
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
finances
will
be
presented
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
imports
for
the
last
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
were
of
the
value
of
of
which
the
amount
exported
was
leaving
in
the
country
for
domestic
use
the
value
of
the
exports
for
the
same
period
was
of
which
consisted
of
domestic
productions
and
of
foreign
articles
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
same
period
amounted
to
of
which
there
was
derived
from
customs
from
sales
of
public
lands
and
from
incidental
and
miscellaneous
sources
the
last
fiscal
year
during
which
this
amount
was
received
embraced
five
months
under
the
operation
of
the
tariff
act
of
and
seven
months
during
which
the
tariff
act
of
was
in
force
during
the
five

under
the
act
of
the
amount
received
from
customs
was
and
during
the
seven
months
under
the
act
of
the
amount
received
was
the
net
revenue
from
customs
during
the
year
ending
on

the

actually
incurred
including
treasury
notes
was
the
public

due
on
the
th
of
march
including
treasury
notes
was
and
consequently
the
addition
made
to
the
public
debt
since
that
time
is
of
the
loan
of
twentythree
millions
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
january
the
sum
of
five
millions
was
paid
out
to
the
public
creditors
or
exchanged
at
par
for
specie
the
remaining
eighteen
millions
was
offered
for
specie
to
the
highest
bidder
not
below
par
by
an
advertisement
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
published
from
the
th
of
february
until
the
th
of
april
when
it
was
awarded
to
the
several
highest
bidders
at
premiums
varying
from
oneeighth
of
per
cent
to
per
cent
above
par
the
premium
has
been
paid
into
the
treasury
and
the
sums
awarded

deposited
in
specie
in
the
treasury
as
fast
as
it
was
required
by
the
wants
of
the
government
to
meet
the
expenditures
for
the
remainder
of
the
present
and
for
the
next
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
a
further
loan
in
aid
of
the
ordinary
revenues
of
the
government
will
be
necessary
retaining
a
sufficient
surplus
in
the
treasury
the
loan
required
for
the
remainder
of
the
present
fiscal
year
will
be
about
if
the
duty
on
tea
and
coffee
be
imposed
and
the
graduation
of
the
price
of
the
public
lands
shall
be
made
at
an
early
period
of
your
session
as
recommended
the
loan
for
the
present
fiscal
year
may
be
reduced
to
the
loan
may
be
further
reduced
by
whatever
amount
of
expenditures
can
be
saved
by
military
contributions
collected
in
mexico
the
most
vigorous
measures
for
the
augmentation
of
these
contributions
have
been
directed
and
a
very
considerable
sum
is
expected
from
that
source
its
amount
can
not
however
be
calculated
with
any
certainty
it
is
recommended
that
the
loan
to
be
made
be
authorized
upon
the
same
terms
and
for
the
same
time
as
that
which
was
authorized
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
the
th
of
january
should
the
war
with
mexico
be
continued
until
the
th
of
june
it
is
estimated
that
a
further
loan
of
will
be
required
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
that
day
in
case
no
duty
be
imposed
on
tea
and
coffee
and
the
public
lands
be
not
reduced
and
graduated
in
price
and
no
military
contributions
shall
be
collected
in
mexico
if
the
duty
on
tea
and
coffee
be
imposed
and
the
lands
be
reduced
and
graduated
in
price
as
proposed
the
loan
may
be
reduced
to
and
will
be
subject
to
be
still
further
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
military
contributions
which
may
be
collected
in
mexico
it
is
not
proposed
however
at
present
to
ask
congress
for
authority
to
negotiate
this
loan
for
the
next
fiscal
year
as
it
is
hoped
that
the
loan
asked
for
the
remainder
of
the
present
fiscal
year
aided
by
military
contributions
which
may
be
collected
in
mexico
may
be
sufficient
if
contrary
to
my
expectation
there
should
be
a
necessity
for
it
the
fact
will
be
communicated
to
congress
in
time
for
their
action
during
the
present
session
in
no
event
will
a
sum
exceeding
of
this
amount
be
needed
before
the
meeting
of
the
session
of
congress
in
december
the
act
of
the
th
of
july
reducing
the
duties
on
imports
has
been
in
force
since
the
st
of
december
last
and
i
am
gratified
to
state
that
all
the
beneficial
effects
which
were
anticipated
from
its
operation
have
been
fully
realized
the
public
revenue
derived
from
customs
during
the
year
ending
on
the
st
of
december
exceeds
by
more
than
the
amount
received
in
the
preceding
year
under
the
operation
of
the
act
of
which
was
superseded
and
repealed
by
it
its
effects
are
visible
in
the
great
and
almost
unexampled
prosperity
which
prevails
in
every
branch
of
business
while
the
repeal
of
the
prohibitory
and
restrictive
duties
of
the
act
of
and
the
substitution
in
their
place
of
reasonable
revenue
rates
levied
on
articles
imported
according
to
their
actual
value
has
increased
the
revenue
and
augmented
our
foreign
trade
all
the
great
interests
of
the
country
have
been
advanced
and
promoted
the
great
and
important
interests
of
agriculture
which
had
been
not
only
too
much
neglected
but
actually
taxed
under
the
protective
policy
for
the
benefit
of
other
interests
have
been
relieved
of
the
burdens
which
that
policy
imposed
on
them
and
our
farmers
and
planters
under
a
more
just
and
liberal
commercial
policy
are
finding
new
and
profitable
markets
abroad
for
their
augmented
products
our
commerce
is
rapidly
increasing
and
is
extending
more
widely
the
circle
of
international
exchanges
great
as
has
been
the
increase
of
our
imports
during
the
past
year
our
exports
of
domestic
products
sold
in
foreign
markets
have
been
still
greater
our
navigating
interest
is
eminently
prosperous
the
number
of
vessels
built
in
the
united
states
has
been
greater
than
during
any
preceding
period
of
equal
length
large
profits
have
been
derived
by
those
who
have
constructed
as
well
as
by
those
who
have
navigated
them
should
the
ratio
of
increase
in
the
number
of
our
merchant
vessels
be
progressive
and
be
as
great
for
the
future
as
during
the
past
year
the
time
is
not
distant
when
our
tonnage
and
commercial
marine
will
be
larger
than
that
of
any
other
nation
in
the
world
whilst
the
interests
of
agriculture
of
commerce
and
of
navigation
have
been
enlarged
and
invigorated
it
is
highly
gratifying
to
observe
that
our
manufactures
are
also
in
a
prosperous
condition
none
of
the
ruinous
effects
upon
this
interest
which
were
apprehended
by
some
as
the
result
of
the
operation
of
the
revenue
system
established
by
the
act
of
have
been
experienced
on
the
contrary
the
number
of
manufactories
and
the
amount
of
capital
invested
in
them
is
steadily
and
rapidly
increasing
affording
gratifying
proofs
that
american
enterprise
and
skill
employed
in
this
branch
of
domestic
industry
with
no
other
advantages
than
those
fairly
and
incidentally
accruing
from
a
just
system
of
revenue
duties
are
abundantly
able
to
meet
successfully
all
competition
from
abroad
and
still
derive
fair
and
remunerating
profits
while
capital
invested
in
manufactures
is
yielding
adequate
and
fair
profits
under
the
new
system
the
wages
of
labor
whether
employed
in
manufactures
agriculture
commerce
or
navigation
have
been
augmented
the
toiling
millions
whose
daily
labor
furnishes
the
supply
of
food
and
raiment
and
all
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
are
receiving
higher
wages
and
more
steady
and
permanent
employment
than
in
any
other
country
or
at
any
previous
period
of
our
own
history
so
successful
have
been
all
branches
of
our
industry
that
a
foreign
war
which
generally
diminishes
the
resources
of
a
nation
has
in
no
essential
degree
retarded
our
onward
progress
or
checked
our
general
prosperity
with
such
gratifying
evidences
of
prosperity
and
of
the
successful
operation
of
the
revenue
act
of
every
consideration
of
public
policy
recommends
that
it
shall
remain
unchanged
it
is
hoped
that
the
system
of
impost
duties
which
it
established
may
be
regarded
as
the
permanent
policy
of
the
country
and
that
the
great
interests
affected
by
it
may
not
again
be
subject
to
be
injuriously
disturbed
as
they
have
heretofore
been
by
frequent
and
sometimes
sudden
changes
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
revenue
and
without
changing
or
modifying
the
rates
imposed
by
the
act
of
on
the
dutiable
articles
embraced
by
its
provisions
i
again
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
expediency
of
levying
a
revenue
duty
on
tea
and
coffee
the
policy
which
exempted
these
articles
from
duty
during
peace
and
when
the
revenue
to
be
derived
from
them
was
not
needed
ceases
to
exist
when
the
country
is
engaged
in
war
and
requires
the
use
of
all
of
its
available
resources
it
is
a
tax
which
would
be
so
generally
diffused
among
the
people
that
it
would
be
felt
oppressively
by
none
and
be
complained
of
by
none
it
is
believed
that
there
are
not
in
the
list
of
imported
articles
any
which
are
more
properly
the
subject
of
war
duties
than
tea
and
coffee
it
is
estimated
that
would
be
derived
annually
by
a
moderate
duty
imposed
on
these
articles
should
congress
avail
itself
of
this
additional
source
of
revenue
not
only
would
the
amount
of
the
public
loan
rendered
necessary
by
the
war
with
mexico
be
diminished
to
that
extent
but
the
public
credit
and
the
public
confidence
in
the
ability
and
determination
of
the
government
to
meet
all
its
engagements
promptly
would
be
more
firmly
established
and
the
reduced
amount
of
the
loan
which
it
may
be
necessary
to
negotiate
could
probably
be
obtained
at
cheaper
rates
congress
is
therefore
called
upon
to
determine
whether
it
is
wiser
to
impose
the
war
duties
recommended
or
by
omitting
to
do
so
increase
the
public
debt
annually
so
long
as
loans
shall
be
required
to
prosecute
the
war
and
afterwards
provide
in
some
other
form
to
pay
the
semiannual
interest
upon
it
and
ultimately
to
extinguish
the
principal
if
in
addition
to
these
duties
congress
should
graduate
and
reduce
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
experience
has
proved
will
not
command
the
price
placed
upon
them
by
the
government
an
additional
annual
income
to
the
treasury
of
between
half
a
million
and
a
million
of
dollars
it
is
estimated
would
be
derived
from
this
source
should
both
measures
receive
the
sanction
of
congress
the
annual
amount
of
public
debt
necessary
to
be
contracted
during
the
continuance
of
the
war
would
be
reduced
near
the
duties
recommended
to
be
levied
on
tea
and
coffee
it
is
proposed
shall
be
limited
in
their
duration
to
the
end
of
the
war
and
until
the
public
debt
rendered
necessary
to
be
contracted
by
it
shall
be
discharged
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
to
be
contracted
should
be
limited
to
the
lowest
practicable
sum
and
should
be
extinguished
as
early
after
the
conclusion
of
the
war
as
the
means
of
the
treasury
will
permit
with
this
view
it
is
recommended
that
as
soon
as
the
war
shall
be
over
all
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
not
needed
for
other
indispensable
objects
shall
constitute
a
sinking
fund
and
be
applied
to
the
purchase
of
the
funded
debt
and
that
authority
be
conferred
by
laws
for
that
purpose
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
to
establish
a
warehousing
system
has
been
in
operation
more
than
a
year
and
has
proved
to
be
an
important
auxiliary
to
the
tariff
act
of
in
augmenting
the
revenue
and
extending
the
commerce
of
the
country
whilst
it
has
tended
to
enlarge
commerce
it
has
been
beneficial
to
our
manufactures
by
diminishing
forced
sales
at
auction
of
foreign
goods
at
low
prices
to
raise
the
duties
to
be
advanced
on
them
and
by
checking
fluctuations
in
the
market
the
system
although
sanctioned
by
the
experience
of
other
countries
was
entirely
new
in
the
united
states
and
is
susceptible
of
improvement
in
some
of
its
provisions
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
upon
whom
was
devolved
large
discretionary
powers
in
carrying
this
measure
into
effect
has
collected
and
is
now
collating
the
practica
l
results
of
the
system
in
other
countries
where
it
has
long
been
established
and
will
report
at
an
early
period
of
your
session
such
further
regulations
suggested
by
the
investigation
as
may
render
it
still
more
effective
and
beneficial
by
the
act
to
provide
for
the
better
organization
of
the
treasury
and
for
the
collection
safekeeping
and
disbursement
of
the
public
revenue
all
banks
were
discontinued
as
fiscal
agents
of
the
government
and
the
paper
currency
issued
by
them
was
no
longer
permitted
to
be
received
in
payment
of
public
dues
the
constitutional
treasury
created
by
this
act
went
into
operation
on
the
st
of
january
last
under
the
system
established
by
it
the
public
moneys
have
been
collected
safely
kept
and
disbursed
by
the
direct
agency
of
officers
of
the
government
in
gold
and
silver
and
transfers
of
large
amounts
have
been
made
from
points
of
collection
to
points
of
disbursement
without
loss
to
the
treasury
or
injury
or
inconvenience
to
the
trade
of
the
country
while
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
have
been
conducted
with
regularity
and
ease
under
this
system
it
has
had
a
salutary
effect
in
checking
and
preventing
an
undue
inflation
of
the
paper
currency
issued
by
the
banks
which
exist
under
state
charters
requiring
as
it
does
all
dues
to
the
government
to
be
paid
in
gold
and
silver
its
effect
is
to
restrain
excessive
issues
of
bank
paper
by
the
banks
disproportioned
to
the
specie
in
their
vaults
for
the
reason
that
they
are
at
all
times
liable
to
be
called
on
by
the
holders
of
their
notes
for
their
redemption
in
order
to
obtain
specie
for
the
payment
of
duties
and
other
public
dues
the
banks
therefore
must
keep
their
business
within
prudent
limits
and
be
always
in
a
condition
to
meet
such
calls
or
run
the
hazard
of
being
compelled
to
suspend
specie
payments
and
be
thereby
discredited
the
amount
of
specie
imported
into
the
united
states
during
the
last
fiscal
year
was
of
which
there
was
retained
in
the
country
had
the
former
financial
system
prevailed
and
the
public
moneys
been
placed
on
deposit
in
the
banks
nearly
the
whole
of
this
amount
would
have
gone
into
their
vaults
not
to
be
thrown
into
circulation
by
them
but
to
be
withheld
from
the
hands
of
the
people
as
a
currency
and
made
the
basis
of
new
and
enormous
issues
of
bank
paper
a
large
proportion
of
the
specie
imported
has
been
paid
into
the
treasury
for
public
dues
and
after
having
been
to
a
great
extent
recoined
at
the
mint
has
been
paid
out
to
the
public
creditors
and
gone
into
circulation
as
a
currency
among
the
people
the
amount
of
gold
and
silver
coin
now
in
circulation
in
the
country
is
larger
than
at
any
former
period
the
financial
system
established
by
the
constitutional
treasury
has
been
thus
far
eminently
successful
in
its
operations
and
i
recommend
an
adherence
to
all
its
essential
provisions
and
especially
to
that
vital
provision
which
wholly
separates
the
government
from
all
connection
with
banks
and
excludes
bank
paper
from
all
revenue
receipts
in
some
of
its
details
not
involving
its
general
principles
the
system
is
defective
and
will
require
modification
these
defects
and
such
amendments
as
are
deemed
important
were
set
forth
in
the
last
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
these
amendments
are
again
recommended
to
the
early
and
favorable
consideration
of
congress
during
the
past
year
the
coinage
at
the
mint
and
its
branches
has
exceeded
this
has
consisted
chiefly
in
converting
the
coins
of
foreign
countries
into
american
coin
the
largest
amount
of
foreign
coin
imported
has
been
received
at
new
york
and
if
a
branch
mint
were
established
at
that
city
all
the
foreign
coin
received
at
that
port
could
at
once
be
converted
into
our
own
coin
without
the
expense
risk
and
delay
of
transporting
it
to
the
mint
for
that
purpose
and
the
amount
recoined
would
be
much
larger
experience
has
proved
that
foreign
coin
and
especially
foreign
gold
coin
will
not
circulate
extensively
as
a
currency
among
the
people
the
important
measure
of
extending
our
specie
circulation
both
of
gold
and
silver
and
of
diffusing
it
among
the
people
can
only
be
effected
by
converting
such
foreign
coin
into
american
coin
i
repeat
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
for
the
establishment
of
a
branch
of
the
mint
of
the
united
states
at
the
city
of
new
york
all
the
public
lands
which
had
been
surveyed
and
were
ready
for
market
have
been
proclaimed
for
sale
during
the
past
year
the
quantity
offered
and
to
be
offered
for
sale
under
proclamations
issued
since
the
st
of
january
last
amounts
to
acres
the
prosperity
of
the
western
states
and
territories
in
which
these
lands
lie
will
be
advanced
by
their
speedy
sale
by
withholding
them
from
market
their
growth
and
increase
of
population
would
be
retarded
while
thousands
of
our
enterprising
and
meritorious
frontier
population
would
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
securing
freeholds
for
themselves
and
their
families
but
in
addition
to
the
general
considerations
which
rendered
the
early
sale
of
these
lands
proper
it
was
a
leading
object
at
this
time
to
derive
as
large
a
sum
as
possible
from
this
source
and
thus
diminish
by
that
amount
the
public
loan
rendered
necessary
by
the
existence
of
a
foreign
war
it
is
estimated
that
not
less
than
acres
of
the
public
lands
will
be
surveyed
and
be
in
a
condition
to
be
proclaimed
for
sale
during
the
year
in
my
last
annual
message
i
presented
the
reasons
which
in
my
judgment
rendered
it
proper
to
graduate
and
reduce
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
have
remained
unsold
for
long
periods
after
they
had
been
offered
for
sale
at
public
auction
many
millions
of
acres
of
public
lands
lying
within
the
limits
of
several
of
the
western
states
have
been
offered
in
the
market
and
been
subject
to
sale
at
private
entry
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
large
quantities
for
more
than
thirty
years
at
the
lowest
price
prescribed
by
the
existing
laws
and
it
has
been
found
that
they
will
not
command
that
price
they
must
remain
unsold
and
uncultivated
for
an
indefinite
period
unless
the
price
demanded
for
them
by
the
government
shall
be
reduced
no
satisfactory
reason
is
perceived
why
they
should
be
longer
held
at
rates
above
their
real
value
at
the
present
period
an
additional
reason
exists
for
adopting
the
measure
recommended
when
the
country
is
engaged
in
a
foreign
war
and
we
must
necessarily
resort
to
loans
it
would
seem
to
be
the
dictate
of
wisdom
that
we
should
avail
ourselves
of
all
our
resources
and
thus
limit
the
amount
of
the
public
indebtedness
to
the
lowest
possible
sum
i
recommend
that
the
existing
laws
on
the
subject
of
preemption
rights
be
amended
and
modified
so
as
to
operate
prospectively
and
to
embrace
all
who
may
settle
upon
the
public
lands
and
make
improvements
upon
them
before
they
are
surveyed
as
well
as
afterwards
in
all
cases
where
such
settlements
may
be
made
after
the
indian
title
shall
have
been
extinguished
if
the
right
of
preemption
be
thus
extended
it
will
embrace
a
large
and
meritorious
class
of
our
citizens
it
will
increase
the
number
of
small
freeholders
upon
our
borders
who
will
be
enabled
thereby
to
educate
their
children
and
otherwise
improve
their
condition
while
they
will
be
found
at
all
times
as
they
have
ever
proved
themselves
to
be
in
the
hour
of
danger
to
their
country
among
our
hardiest
and
best
volunteer
soldiers
ever
ready
to
attend
to
their
services
in
cases
of
emergencies
and
among
the
last
to
leave
the
field
as
long
as
an
enemy
remains
to
be
encountered
such
a
policy
will
also
impress
these
patriotic
pioneer
emigrants
with
deeper
feelings
of
gratitude
for
the
parental
care
of
their
government
when
they
find
their
dearest
interests
secured
to
them
by
the
permanent
laws
of
the
land
and
that
they
are
no
longer
in
danger
of
losing
their
homes
and
hardearned
improvements
by
being
brought
into
competition
with
a
more
wealthy
class
of
purchasers
at
the
land
sales
the
attention
of
congress
was
invited
at
their
last
and
the
preceding
session
to
the
importance
of
establishing
a
territorial
government
over
our
possessions
in
oregon
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
there
was
no
legislation
on
the
subject
our
citizens
who
inhabit
that
distant
region
of
country
are
still
left
without
the
protection
of
our
laws
or
any
regularly
organized
government
before
the
question
of
limits
and
boundaries
of
the
territory
of
oregon
was
definitely
settled
from
the
necessity
of
their
condition
the
inhabitants
had
established
a
temporary
government
of
their
own
besides
the
want
of
legal
authority
for
continuing
such
a
government
it
is
wholly
inadequate
to
protect
them
in
their
rights
of
person
and
property
or
to
secure
to
them
the
enjoyment
of
the
privileges
of
other
citizens
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
they
should
have
the
right
of
suffrage
be
represented
in
a
territorial
legislature
and
by
a
delegate
in
congress
and
possess
all
the
rights
and
privileges
which
citizens
of
other
portions
of
the
territories
of
the
united
states
have
heretofore
enjoyed
or
may
now
enjoy
our
judicial
system
revenue
laws
laws
regulating
trade
and
intercourse
with
the
indian
tribes
and
the
protection
of
our
laws
generally
should
be
extended
over
them
in
addition
to
the
inhabitants
in
that
territory
who
had
previously
emigrated
to
it
large
numbers
of
our
citizens
have
followed
them
during
the
present
year
and
it
is
not
doubted
that
during
the
next
and
subsequent
years
their
numbers
will
be
greatly
increased
congress
at
its
last
session
established
post
routes
leading
to
oregon
and
between
different
points
within
that
territory
and
authorized
the
establishment
of
postoffices
at
astoria
and
such
other
places
on
the
coasts
of
the
pacific
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
as
the
public
interests
may
require
postoffices
have
accordingly
been
established
deputy
postmasters
appointed
and
provision
made
for
the
transportation
of
the
mails
the
preservation
of
peace
with
the
indian
tribes
residing
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
will
re
nder
it
proper
that
authority
should
be
given
by
law
for
the
appointment
of
an
adequate
number
of
indian
agents
to
reside
among
them
i
recommend
that
a
surveyorgenerals
office
be
established
in
that
territory
and
that
the
public
lands
be
surveyed
and
brought
into
market
at
an
early
period
i
recommend
also
that
grants
upon
liberal
terms
of
limited
quantities
of
the
public
lands
be
made
to
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
have
emigrated
or
may
hereafter
within
a
prescribed
period
emigrate
to
oregon
and
settle
upon
them
these
hardy
and
adventurous
citizens
who
have
encountered
the
dangers
and
privations
of
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
and
have
at
length
found
an
abiding
place
for
themselves
and
their
families
upon
the
utmost
verge
of
our
western
limits
should
be
secured
in
the
homes
which
they
have
improved
by
their
labor
i

a
detailed
account
of
the
operations
of
the
various
branches
of
the
public
service
connected
with
the
department
under
his
charge
the
duties
devolving
on
this
department
have
been
unusually
onerous
and
responsible
during
the
past
year
and
have
been
discharged
with
ability
and
success
pacific
relations
continue
to
exist
with
the
various
indian
tribes
and
most
of
them
manifest
a
strong
friendship
for
the
united
states
some
depredations
were
committed
during
the
past
year
upon
our
trains
transporting
supplies
for
the
army
on
the
road
between
the
western
border
of
missouri
and
santa
fe
these
depredations
which
are
supposed
to
have
been
committed
by
bands
from
the
region
of
new
mexico
have
been
arrested
by
the
presence
of
a
military
force
ordered
out
for
that
purpose
some
outrages
have
been
perpetrated
by
a
portion
of
the
northwestern
bands
upon
the
weaker
and
comparatively
defenseless
neighboring
tribes
prompt
measures
were
taken
to
prevent
such
occurrences
in
future
between
and
indians
belonging
to
several
tribes
have
been
removed
during
the
year
from
the
east
of
the
mississippi
to
the
country
allotted
to
them
west
of
that
river
as
their
permanent
home
and
arrangements
have
been
made
for
others
to
follow
since
the
treaty
of
with
the
cherokees
the
feuds
among
them
appear
to
have
subsided
and
they
have
become
more
united
and
contented
than
they
have
been
for
many
years
past
the
commissioners
appointed
in
pursuance
of
the
act
of
june
to
settle
claims
arising
under
the
treaty
of
with
that
tribe
have
executed
their
duties
and
after
a
patient
investigation
and
a
full
and
fair
examination
of
all
the
cases
brought
before
them
closed
their
labors
in
the
month
of
july
last
this
is
the
fourth
board
of
commissioners
which
has
been
organized
under
this
treaty
ample
opportunity
has
been
afforded
to
all
those
interested
to
bring
forward
their
claims
no
doubt
is
entertained
that
impartial
justice
has
been
done
by
the
late
board
and
that
all
valid
claims
embraced
by
the
treaty
have
been
considered
and
allowed
this
result
and
the
final
settlement
to
be
made
with
this
tribe
under
the
treaty
of
which
will
be
completed
and
laid
before
you
during
your
session
will
adjust
all
questions
of
controversy
between
them
and
the
united
states
and
produce
a
state
of
relations
with
them
simple
well
defined
and
satisfactory
under
the
discretionary
authority
conferred
by
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
last
the
annuities
due
to
the
various
tribes
have
been
paid
during
the
present
year
to
the
heads
of
families
instead
of
to
their
chiefs
or
such
persons
as
they
might
designate
as
required
by
the
law
previously
existing
this
mode
of
payment
has
given
general
satisfaction
to
the
great
body
of
the
indians
justice
has
been
done
to
them
and
they
are
grateful
to
the
government
for
it
a
few
chiefs
and
interested
persons
may
object
to
this
mode
of
payment
but
it
is
believed
to
be
the
only
mode
of
preventing
fraud
and
imposition
from
being
practiced
upon
the
great
body
of
common
indians
constituting
a
majority
of
all
the
tribes
it
is
gratifying
to
perceive
that
a
number
of
the
tribes
have
recently
manifested
an
increased
interest
in
the
establishment
of
schools
among
them
and
are
making
rapid
advances
in
agriculture
some
of
them
producing
a
sufficient
quantity
of
food
for
their
support
and
in
some
cases
a
surplus
to
dispose
of
to
their
neighbors
the
comforts
by
which
those
who
have
received
even
a
very
limited
education
and
have
engaged
in
agriculture
are
surrounded
tend
gradually
to
draw
off
their
less
civilized
brethren
from
the
precarious
means
of
subsistence
by
the
chase
to
habits
of
labor
and
civilization
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
presents
a
satisfactory
and
gratifying
account
of
the
condition
and
operations
of
the
naval
service
during
the
past
year
our
commerce
has
been
pursued
with
increased
activity
and
with
safety
and
success
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
under
the
protection
of
our
flag
which
the
navy
has
caused
to
be
respected
in
the
most
distant
seas
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
in
the
pacific
the
officers
and
men
of
our
squadrons
have
displayed
distinguished
gallantry
and
performed
valuable
services
in
the
early
stages
of
the
war
with
mexico
her
ports
on
both
coasts
were
blockaded
and
more
recently
many
of
them
have
been
captured
and
held
by
the
navy
when
acting
in
cooperation
with
the
land
forces
the
naval
officers
and
men
have
performed
gallant
and
distinguished
services
on
land
as
well
as
on
water
and
deserve
the
high
commendation
of
the
country
while
other
maritime
powers
are
adding
to
their
navies
large
numbers
of
war
steamers
it
was
a
wise
policy
on
our
part
to
make
similar
additions
to
our
navy
the
four
war
steamers
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
are
in
course
of
construction
in
addition
to
the
four
war
steamers
authorized
by
this
act
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
in
pursuance
of
its
provisions
entered
into
contracts
for
the
construction
of
five
steamers
to
be
employed
in
the
transportation
of
the
united
states
mail
from
new
york
to
new
orleans
touching
at
charleston
savannah
and
havana
and
from
havana
to
chagres
for
three
steamers
to
be
employed
in
like
manner
from
panama
to
oregon
so
as
to
connect
with
the
mail
from
havana
to
chagres
across
the
isthmus
and
for
five
steamers
to
be
employed
in
like
manner
from
new
york
to
liverpool
these
steamers
will
be
the
property
of
the
contractors
but
are
to
be
built
under
the
superintendence
and
direction
of
a
naval
constructor
in
the
employ
of
the
navy
department
and
to
be
so
constructed
as
to
render
them
convertible
at
the
least
possible
expense
into
war
steamers
of
the
first
class
a
prescribed
number
of
naval
officers
as
well
as
a
postoffice
agent
are
to
be
on
board
of
them
and
authority
is
reserved
to
the
navy
department
at
all
times
to
exercise
control
over
said
steamships
and
to
have
the
right
to
take
them
for
the
exclusive
use
and
service
of
the
united
states
upon
making
proper
compensation
to
the
contractors
therefor
whilst
these
steamships
will
be
employed
in
transporting
the
mails
of
the
united
states
coastwise
and
to
foreign
countries
upon
an
annual
compensation
to
be
paid
to
the
owners
they
will
be
always
ready
upon
an
emergency
requiring
it
to
be
converted
into
war
steamers
and
the
right
reserved
to
take
them
for
public
use
will
add
greatly
to
the
efficiency
and
strength
of
this
description
of
our
naval
force
to
the
steamers
thus
authorized
under
contracts
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
should
be
added
five
other
steamers
authorized
under
contracts
made
in
pursuance
of
laws
by
the
postmastergeneral
making
an
addition
in
the
whole
of
eighteen
war
steamers
subject
to
be
taken
for
public
use
as
further
contracts
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
to
foreign
countries
may
be
authorized
by
congress
this
number
may
be
enlarged
indefinitely
the
enlightened
policy
by
which
a
rapid
communication
with
the
various
distant
parts
of
the
globe
is
established
by
means
of
american
built
sea
steamers
would
find
an
ample
reward
in
the
increase
of
our
commerce
and
in
making
our
country
and
its
resources
more
favorably
known
abroad
but
the
national
advantage
is
still
greaterof
having
our
naval
officers
made
familiar
with
steam
navigation
and
of
having
the
privilege
of
taking
the
ships
already
equipped
for
immediate
service
at
a
moments
notice
and
will
be
cheaply
purchased
by
the
compensation
to
be
paid
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
in
them
over
and
above
the
postages
received
a
just
national
pride
no
less
than
our
commercial
interests
would
seem
to
favor
the
policy
of
augmenting
the
number
of
this
description
of
vessels
they
can
be
built
in
our
country
cheaper
and
in
greater
numbers
than
in
any
other
in
the
world
i
refer
you
to
the
accompanying
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
for
a
detailed
and
satisfactory
account
of
the
condition
and
operations
of
that
department
during
the
past
year
it
is
gratifying
to
find
that
within
so
short
a
period
after
the
reduction
in
the
rates
of
postage
and
notwithstanding
the
great
increase
of
mail
service
the
revenue
received
for
the
year
will
be
sufficient
to
defray
all
the
expenses
and
that
no
further
aid
will
be
required
from
the
treasury
for
that
purpose
the
first
of
the
american
mail
steamers
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
was
completed
and
entered
upon
the
service
on
the
st
of
june
last
and
is
now
on
her
third
voyage
to
bremen
and
other
intermediate
ports
the
other
vessels
authorized
under
the
provisions
of
that
act
are
in
course
of
construction
and
will
be
put
upon
the
line
as
soon
as
completed
contracts
have
also
been
made
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
in
a
steamer
from
charleston
to
havana
a
reciprocal
and
satisfactory
postal
arrangement
has
been
made
by
the
postmastergeneral
with
the
authorities
of
bremen
and
no
difficulty
is
apprehended
in
making
similar
arrangements
with
all
other
powers
with
which
we
may
have
communications
by
mail
steamers
except
with
great
britain
on
the
arrival
of
the
first
of
the
american
steamers
bound
to
bremen
at
southampton
in
the
month
of
june
last
the
british
postoffice
directed
the
collection
of
disc
riminating
postages
on
all
letters
and
other
mailable
matter
which
she
took
out
to
great
britain
or
which
went
into
the
british
postoffice
on
their
way
to
france
and
other
parts
of
europe
the
effect
of
the
order
of
the
british
postoffice
is
to
subject
all
letters
and
other
matter
transported
by
american
steamers
to
double
postage
one
postage
having
been
previously
paid
on
them
to
the
united
states
while
letters
transported
in
british
steamers
are
subject
to
pay
but
a
single
postage
this
measure
was
adopted
with
the
avowed
object
of
protecting
the
british
line
of
mail
steamers
now
running
between
boston
and
liverpool
and
if
permitted
to
continue
must
speedily
put
an
end
to
the
transportation
of
all
letters
and
other
matter
by
american
steamers
and
give
to
british
steamers
a
monopoly
of
the
business
a
just
and
fair
reciprocity
is
all
that
we
desire
and
on
this
we
must
insist
by
our
laws
no
such
discrimination
is
made
against
british
steamers
bringing
letters
into
our
ports
but
all
letters
arriving
in
the
united
states
are
subject
to
the
same
rate
of
postage
whether
brought
in
british
or
american
vessels
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
for
a
full
statement
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
of
the
steps
taken
by
him
to
correct
this
inequality
he
has
exerted
all
the
power
conferred
upon
him
by
the
existing
laws
the
minister
of
the
united
states
at
london
has
brought
the
subject
to
the
attention
of
the
british
government
and
is
now
engaged
in
negotiations
for
the
purpose
of
adjusting
reciprocal
postal
arrangements
which
shall
be
equally
just
to
both
countries
should
he
fail
in
concluding
such
arrangements
and
should
great
britain
insist
on
enforcing
the
unequal
and
unjust
measure
she
has
adopted
it
will
become
necessary
to
confer
additional
powers
on
the
postmastergeneral
in
order
to
enable
him
to
meet
the
emergency
and
to
put
our
own
steamers
on
an
equal
footing
with
british
steamers
engaged
in
transporting
the
mails
between
the
two
countries
and
i
recommend
that
such
powers
be
conferred
in
view
of
the
existing
state
of
our
country
i
trust
it
may
not
be
inappropriate
in
closing
this
communication
to
call
to
mind
the
words
of
wisdom
and
admonition
of
the
first
and
most
illustrious
of
my
predecessors
in
his
farewell
address
to
his
countrymen
that
greatest
and
best
of
men
who
served
his
country
so
long
and
loved
it
so
much
foresaw
with
serious
concern
the
danger
to
our
union
of
characterizing
parties
by
geographical
discriminationsnorthern
and
southern
atlantic
and
westernwhence
designing
men
may
endeavor
to
excite
a
belief
that
there
is
a
real
difference
of
local
interests
and
views
and
warned
his
countrymen
against
it
so
deep
and
solemn
was
his
conviction
of
the
importance
of
the
union
and
of
preserving
harmony
between
its
different
parts
that
he
declared
to
his
countrymen
in
that
address
it
is
of
infinite
moment
that
you
should
properly
estimate
the
immense
value
of
your
national
union
to
your
collective
and
individual
happiness
that
you
should
cherish
a
cordial
habitual
and
immovable
attachment
to
it
accustoming
yourselves
to
think
and
speak
of
it
as
of
the
palladium
of
your
political
safety
and
prosperity
watching
for
its
preservation
with
jealous
anxiety
discountenancing
whatever
may
suggest
even
a
suspicion
that
it
can
in
any
event
be
abandoned
and
indignantly
frowning
upon
the
first
dawning
of
every
attempt
to
alienate
any
portion
of
our
country
from
the
rest
or
to
enfeeble
the
sacred
ties
which
now
link
together
the
various
parts
after
the
lapse
of
half
a
century
these
admonitions
of
washington
fall
upon
us
with
all
the
force
of
truth
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
immense
value
of
our
glorious
union
of
confederated
states
to
which
we
are
so
much
indebted
for
our
growth
in
population
and
wealth
and
for
all
that
constitutes
us
a
great
and
a
happy
nation
how
unimportant
are
all
our
differences
of
opinion
upon
minor
questions
of
public
policy
compared
with
its
preservation
and
how
scrupulously
should
we
avoid
all
agitating
topics
which
may
tend
to
distract
and
divide
us
into
contending
parties
separated
by
geographical
lines
whereby
it
may
be
weakened
or
endangered
invoking
the
blessing
of
the
almighty
ruler
of
the
universe
upon
your
deliberations
it
will
be
my
highest
duty
no
less
than
my
sincere
pleasure
to
cooperate

been
our

in

that
though
steadily

rapidly
advancing

we

given
no

complaint
to
any

and
have
enjoyed
the
blessings
of
peace
for
more
than
thirty
years
from
a
policy
so
sacred
to
humanity
and
so
salutary
in
its
effects
upon
our
political
system
we
should
never
be
induced
voluntarily
to
depart
the
existing
war
with
mexico
was
neither
desired
nor
provoked
by
the
united
states
on
the
contrary
all
honorable
means
were
resorted
to
to
avert
it
after
years
of
endurance
of
aggravated
and
unredressed
wrongs
on
our
part
mexico
in
violation
of
solemn
treaty
stipulations
and
of
every
principle
of
justice
recognized
by
civilized
nations
commenced
hostilities
and
thus
by
her
own
act
forced
the
war
upon
us
long
before
the
advance
of
our
army
to
the
left
bank
of
the
rio
grande
we
had
ample
cause
of
war
against
mexico
and
had
the
united
states
resorted
to
this
extremity
we
might
have
appealed
to
the
whole
civilized
world
for
the
justice
of
our
cause
i
deem
it
to
be
my
duty
to
present
to
you
on
the
present
occasion
a
condensed
review
of
the
injuries
we
had
sustained
of
the
causes
which
led
to
the
war
and
of
its
progress
since
its
commencement
this
is
rendered
the
more
necessary
because
of
the
misapprehensions
which
have
to
some
extent
prevailed
as
to
its
origin
and
true
character
the
war
has
been
represented
as
unjust
and
unnecessary
and
as
one
of
aggression
on
our
part
upon
a
weak
and
injured
enemy
such
erroneous
views
though
entertained
by
but
few
have
been
widely
and
extensively
circulated
not
only
at
home
but
have
been
spread
throughout
mexico
and
the
whole
world
a
more
effectual
means
could
not
have
been
devised
to
encourage
the
enemy
and
protract
the
war
than
to
advocate
and
adhere
to
their
cause
and
thus
give
them
aid
and
comfort
it
is
a
source
of
national
pride
and
exultation
that
the
great
body
of
our
people
have
thrown
no
such
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
government
in
prosecuting
the
war
successfully
but
have
shown
themselves
to
be
eminently
patriotic
and
ready
to
vindicate
their
countrys
honor
and
interests
at
any
sacrifice
the
alacrity
and
promptness
with
which
our
volunteer
forces
rushed
to
the
field
on
their
countrys
call
prove
not
only
their
patriotism
but
their
deep
conviction
that
our
cause
is
just
the
wrongs
which
we
have
suffered
from
mexico
almost
ever
since
she
became
an
independent
power
and
the
patient
endurance
with
which
we
have
borne
them
are
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
modern
civilized
nations
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
if
these
wrongs
had
been
resented
and
resisted
in
the
first
instance
the
present
war
might
have
been
avoided
one
outrage
however
permitted
to
pass
with
impunity
almost
necessarily
encouraged
the
perpetration
of
another
until
at
last
mexico
seemed
to
attribute
to
weakness
and
indecision
on
our
part
a
forbearance
which
was
the
offspring
of
magnanimity
and
of
a
sincere
desire
to
preserve
friendly
relations
with
a
sister
republic
scarcely
had
mexico
achieved
her
independence
which
the
united
states
were
the
first
among
the
nations
to
acknowledge
when
she
commenced
the
system
of
insult
and
spoliation
which
she
has
ever
since
pursued
our
citizens
engaged
in
lawful
commerce
were
imprisoned
their
vessels
seized
and
our
flag
insulted
in
her
ports
if
money
was
wanted
the
lawless
seizure
and
confiscation
of
our
merchant
vessels
and
their
cargoes
was
a
ready
resource
and
if
to
accomplish
their
purposes
it
became
necessary
to
imprison
the
owners
captains
and
crews
it
was
done
rulers
superseded
rulers
in
mexico
in
rapid
succession
but
still
there
was
no
change
in
this
system
of
depredation
the
government
of
the
united
states
made
repeated
reclamations
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
but
these
were
answered
by
the
perpetration
of
new
outrages
promises
of
redress
made
by
mexico
in
the
most
solemn
forms
were
postponed
or
evaded
the
files
and
records
of
the
department
of
state
contain
conclusive
proofs
of
numerous
lawless
acts
perpetrated
upon
the
property
and
persons
of
our
citizens
by
mexico
and
of
wanton
insults
to
our
national
flag
the
interposition
of
our
government
to
obtain
redress
was
again
and
again
invoked
under
circumstances
which
no
nation
ought
to
disregard
it
was
hoped
that
these
outrages
would
cease
and
that
mexico
would
be
restrained
by
the
laws
which
regulate
the
conduct
of
civilized
nations
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
after
the
treaty
of
amity
commerce
and
navigation
of
the
th
of
april
was
concluded
between
the
two
republics
but
this
hope
soon
proved
to
be
vain
the
course
of
seizure
and
confiscation
of
the
property
of
our
citizens
the
violation
of
their
persons
and
the
insults
to
our
flag
pursued
by
mexico
previous
to
that
time
were
scarcely
suspended
for
even
a
brief
period
although
the
treaty
so
clearly
defines
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
respective
parties
that
it
is
impossible
to
misunderstand
or
mistake
them
in
less
than
seven
years
after
the
conclusion
of
that
treaty
our
grievances
had
become
so
intolerable
that
in
the
opinion
of
president
jackson
they
should
no
longer
be
endured
in
his
message
to
congress
in
february
he
presented
them
to
the
consideration
of
that
body
and
declared
that
the
length
of
time
since
some
of
the
injuries
have
been
committed
the
repeated
and
unavailing
applications
for
redress
the
wanton
character
of
some
of
the
outrages
upon
the
property
and
persons
of
our
citizens
upon
the
officers
and
flag
of
the
united
states
independent
of
recent
insults
to
this
government
and
people
by
the
late
extraordinary
mexican
minister
would
justify
in
the
eyes
of
all
nations
immediate
war
in
a
spirit
of
kindness
and
forbearance
however
he
recommended
reprisals
as
a
milder
mode
of
redress
he
declared
that
war
should
not
be
used
as
a
remedy
by
just
and
generous
nations
confiding
in
their
strength
for
injuries
committed
if
it
can
be
honorably
avoided
and
added
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
considering
the
present
embarrassed
condition
of
that
country
we
should
act
with
both
wisdom
and
moderation
by
giving
to
mexico
one
more
opportunity
to
atone
for
the
past
before
we
take
redress
into
our
own
hands
to
avoid
all
misconception
on
the
part
of
mexico
as
well
as
to
protect
our
own
national
character
from
reproach
this
opportunity
should
be
given
with
the
avowed
design
and
full
preparation
to
take
immediate
satisfaction
if
it
should
not
be
obtained
on
a
repetition
of
the
demand
for
it
to
this
end
i
recommend
that
an
act
be
passed
authorizing
reprisals
and
the
use
of
the
naval
force
of
the
united
states
by
the
executive
against
mexico
to
enforce
them
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
by
the
mexican
government
to
come
to
an
amicable
adjustment
of
the
matters
in
controversy
between
us
upon
another
demand
thereof
made
from
on
board
out
of
our
vessels
of
war
on
the
coast
of
mexico
committees
of
both
houses
of
congress
to
which
this
message
of
the
president
was
referred
fully
sustained
his
views
of
the
character
of
the
wrongs
which
we
had
suffered
from
mexico
and
recommended
that
another
demand
for
redress
should
be
made
before
authorizing
war
or
reprisals
the
committee
on
foreign
relations
of
the
senate
in
their
report
say
after
such
a
demand
should
prompt
justice
be
refused
by
the
mexican
government
we
may
appeal
to
all
nations
not
only
for
the
equity
and
moderation
with
which
we
shall
have
acted
toward
a
sister
republic
but
for
the
necessity
which
will
then
compel
us
to
seek
redress
for
our
wrongs
either
by
actual
war
or
by
reprisals
the
subject
will
then
be
presented
before
congress
at
the
commencement
of
the
next
session
in
a
clear
and
distinct
form
and
the
committee
can
not
doubt
but
that
such
measures
will
be
immediately
adopted
as
may
be
necessary
to
vindicate
the
honor
of
the
country
and
insure
ample
reparation
to
our
injured
fellowcitizens
the
committee
on
foreign
affairs
of
the
house
of
representatives
made
a
similar
recommendati
on
in
their
report
they
say
that
they
fully
concur
with
the
president
that
ample
cause
exists
for
taking
redress
into
our
own
hands
and
believe
that
we
should
be
justified
in
the
opinion
of
other
nations
for
taking
such
a
step
but
they
are
willing
to
try
the
experiment
of
another
demand
made
in
the
most
solemn
form
upon
the
justice
of
the
mexican
government
before
any
further
proceedings
are
adopted
no
difference
of
opinion
upon
the
subject
is
believed
to
have
existed
in
congress
at
that
time
the
executive
and
legislative
departments
concurred
and
yet
such
has
been
our
forbearance
and
desire
to
preserve
peace
with
mexico
that
the
wrongs
of
which
we
then
complained
and
which
gave
rise
to
these
solemn
proceedings
not
only
remain
unredressed
to
this
day
but
additional
causes
of
complaint
of
an
aggravated
character
have
ever
since
been
accumulating
shortly
after
these
proceedings
a
special
messenger
was
dispatched
to
mexico
to
make
a
final
demand
for
redress
and
on
the
th
of
july
the
demand
was
made
the
reply
of
the
mexican
government
bears
date
on
the
th
of
the
same
month
and
contains
assurances
of
the
anxious
wish
of
the
mexican
government
not
to
delay
the
moment
of
that
final
and
equitable
adjustment
which
is
to
terminate
the
existing
difficulties
between
the
two
governments
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
which
may
contribute
to
the
most
speedy
and
equitable
determination
of
the
subjects
which
have
so
seriously
engaged
the
attention
of
the
american
government
that
the
mexican
government
would
adopt
as
the
only
guides
for
its
conduct
the
plainest
principles
of
public
right
the
sacred
obligations
imposed
by
international
law
and
the
religious
faith
of
treaties
and
that
whatever
reason
and
justice
may
dictate
respecting
each
case
will
be
done
the
assurance
was
further
given
that
the
decision
of
the
mexican
government
upon
each
cause
of
complaint
for
which
redress
had
been
demanded
should
be
communicated
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
the
mexican
minister
at
washington
these
solemn
assurances
in
answer
to
our
demand
for
redress
were
disregarded
by
making
them
however
mexico
obtained
further
delay
president
van
buren
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
of
the
th
of
december
states
that
although
the
larger
number
of
our
demands
for
redress
and
many
of
them
aggravated
cases
of
personal
wrongs
have
been
now
for
years
before
the
mexican
government
and
some
of
the
causes
of
national
complaint
and
those
of
the
most
offensive
character
admitted
of
immediate
simple
and
satisfactory
replies
it
is
only
within
a
few
days
past
that
any
specific
communication
in
answer
to
our
last
demand
made
five
months
ago
has
been
received
from
the
mexican
minister
and
that
for
not
one
of
our
public
complaints
has
satisfaction
been
given
or
offered
that
but
one
of
the
cases
of
personal
wrong
has
been
favorably
considered
and
that
but
four
cases
of
both
descriptions
out
of
all
those
formally
presented
and
earnestly
pressed
have
as
yet
been
decided
upon
by
the
mexican
government
president
van
buren
believing
that
it
would
be
vain
to
make
any
further
attempt
to
obtain
redress
by
the
ordinary
means
within
the
power
of
the
executive
communicated
this
opinion
to
congress
in
the
message
referred
to
in
which
he
said
on
a
careful
and
deliberate
examination
of
their
contents
of
the
correspondence
with
the
mexican
government
and
considering
the
spirit
manifested
by
the
mexican
government
it
has
become
my
painful
duty
to
return
the
subject
as
it
now
stands
to
congress
to
whom
it
belongs
to
decide
upon
the
time
the
mode
and
the
measure
of
redress
had
the
united
states
at
that
time
adopted
compulsory
measures
and
taken
redress
into
their
own
hands
all
our
difficulties
with
mexico
would
probably
have
been
long
since
adjusted
and
the
existing
war
have
been
averted
magnanimity
and
moderation
on
our
part
only
had
the
effect
to
complicate
these
difficulties
and
render
an
amicable
settlement
of
them
the
more
embarrassing
that
such
measures
of
redress
under
similar
provocations
committed
by
any
of
the
powerful
nations
of
europe
would
have
been
promptly
resorted
to
by
the
united
states
can
not
be
doubted
the
national
honor
and
the
preservation
of
the
national
character
throughout
the
world
as
well
as
our
own
selfrespect
and
the
protection
due
to
our
own
citizens
would
have
rendered
such
a
resort
indispensable
the
history
of
no
civilized
nation
in
modern
times
has
presented
within
so
brief
a
period
so
many
wanton
attacks
upon
the
honor
of
its
flag
and
upon
the
property
and
persons
of
its
citizens
as
had
at
that
time
been
borne
by
the
united
states
from
the
mexican
authorities
and
people
but
mexico
was
a
sister
republic
on
the
north
american
continent
occupying
a
territory
contiguous
to
our
own
and
was
in
a
feeble
and
distracted
condition
and
these
considerations
it
is
presumed
induced
congress
to
forbear
still
longer
instead
of
taking
redress
into
our
own
hands
a
new
negotiation
was
entered
upon
with
fair
promises
on
the
part
of
mexico
but
with
the
real
purpose
as
the
event
has
proved
of
indefinitely
postponing
the
reparation
which
we
demanded
and
which
was
so
justly
due
this
negotiation
after
more
than
a
years
delay
resulted
in
the
convention
of
the
th
of
april
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america
upon
the
government
of
the
mexican
republic
the
joint
board
of
commissioners
created
by
this
convention
to
examine
and
decide
upon
these
claims
was
not
organized
until
the
month
of
august
and
under
the
terms
of
the
convention
they
were
to
terminate
their
duties
within
eighteen
months
from
that
time
four
of
the
eighteen
months
were
consumed
in
preliminary
discussions
on
frivolous
and
dilatory
points
raised
by
the
mexican
commissioners
and
it
was
not
until
the
month
of
december
that
they
commenced
the
examination
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
mexico
fourteen
months
only
remained
to
examine
and
decide
upon
these
numerous
and
complicated
cases
in
the
month
of
february
the
term
of
the
commission
expired
leaving
many
claims
undisposed
of
for
want
of
time
the
claims
which
were
allowed
by
the
board
and
by
the
umpire
authorized
by
the
convention
to
decide
in
case
of
disagreement
between
the
mexican
and
american
commissioners
amounted
to
there
were
pending
before
the
umpire
when
the
commission
expired
additional
claims
which
had
been
examined
and
awarded
by
the
american
commissioners
and
had
not
been
allowed
by
the
mexican
commissioners
amounting
to
upon
which
he
did
not
decide
alleging
that
his
authority
had
ceased
with
the
termination
of
the
joint
commission
besides
these
claims
there
were
others
of
american
citizens
amounting
to
which
had
been
submitted
to
the
board
and
upon
which
they
had
not
time
to
decide
before
their
final
adjournment
the
sum
of
which
had
been
awarded
to
the
claimants
was
a
liquidated
and
ascertained
debt
due
by
mexico
about
which
there
could
be
no
dispute
and
which
she
was
bound
to
pay
according
to
the
terms
of
the
convention
soon
after
the
final
awards
for
this
amount
had
been
made
the
mexican
government
asked
for
a
postponement
of
the
time
of
making
payment
alleging
that
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
make
the
payment
at
the
time
stipulated
in
the
spirit
of
forbearing
kindness
toward
a
sister
republic
which
mexico
has
so
long
abused
the
united
states
promptly
complied
with
her
request
a
second
convention
was
accordingly
concluded
between
the
two
governments
on
the
th
of
january
which
upon
its
face
declares
that
this
new
arrangement
is
entered
into
for
the
accommodation
of
mexico
by
the
terms
of
this
convention
all
the
interest
due
on
the
awards
which
had
been
made
in
favor
of
the
claimants
under
the
convention
of
the
th
of
april
was
to
be
paid
to
them
on
the
th
of
april
and
the
principal
of
the
said
awards
and
the
interest
accruing
thereon
was
stipulated
to
be
paid
in
five
years
in
equal
installments
every
three
months
notwithstanding
this
new
convention
was
entered
into
at
the
request
of
mexico
and
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
her
from
embarrassment
the
claimants
have
only
received
the
interest
due
on
the
th
of
april
and
three
of
the
twenty
installments
although
the
payment
of
the
sum
thus
liquidated
and
confessedly
due
by
mexico
to
our
citizens
as
indemnity
for
acknowledged
acts
of
outrage
and
wrong
was
secured
by
treaty
the
obligations
of
which
are
ever
held
sacred
by
all
just
nations
yet
mexico
has
violated
this
solemn
engagement
by
failing
and
refusing
to
make
the
payment
the
two
installments
due
in
april
and
july
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
connected
with
them
have
been
assumed
by
the
united
states
and
discharged
to
the
claimants
but
they
are
still
due
by
mexico
but
this
is
not
all
of
which
we
have
just
cause
of
complaint
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
claimants
whose
cases
were
not
decided
by
the
joint
commission
under
the
convention
of
april
it
was
expressly
stipulated
by
the
sixth
article
of
the
convention
of
the
th
of
january
that
a
new
convention
shall
be
entered
into
for
the
settlement
of
all
claims
of
the
government
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
the
republic
of
mexico
which
were
not
finally
decided
by
the
late
commission
which
met
in
the
city
of
washington
and
of
all
claims
of
the
government
and
citizens
of
mexico
against
the
united
states
in
conformity
with
this
stipulation
a
third
convention
was
concluded
and
signed
at
the
city
of
mexico
on
the
th
of
november
by
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
two
governments
by
which
provision
was
made
for
ascertaining
and
paying
these
claims
in
january
this
convention
was
ratified
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
with
two
amendments
which
were
manifestly
reasonable
in
their
character
upon
a
reference
of
the
amendments
proposed
to
the
government
of
mexico
the
same
evasions
difficulties
and
delays
were
interposed
which
have
so
long
marked
the
policy
of
that
government
toward
the
united
states
it
has
not
even
yet
decided
whether
it
would
or
would
not
accede
to
them
although
the
subject
has
been
repeatedly
pressed
upon
its
consideration
mexico

has
thus
violated
a
second
time
the
faith
of
treaties
by
failing
or
refusing
to
carry
into
effect
the
sixth
article
of
the
convention
of
january
such
is
the
history
of
the
wrongs
which
we
have
suffered
and
patiently
endured
from
mexico
through
a
long
series
of
years
so
far
from
affording
reasonable
satisfaction
for
the
injuries
and
insults
we
had
borne
a
great
aggravation
of
them
consists
in
the
fact
that
while
the
united
states
anxious
to
preserve
a
good
understanding
with
mexico
have
been
constantly
but
vainly
employed
in
seeking
redress
for
past
wrongs
new
outrages
were
constantly
occurring
which
have
continued
to
increase
our
causes
of
complaint
and
to
swell
the
amount
of
our
demands
while
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
were
conducting
a
lawful
commerce
with
mexico
under
the
guaranty
of
a
treaty
of
amity
commerce
and
navigation
many
of
them
have
suffered
all
the
injuries
which
would
have
resulted
from
open
war
this
treaty
instead
of
affording
protection
to
our
citizens
has
been
the
means
of
inviting
them
into
the
ports
of
mexico
that
they
might
be
as
they
have
been
in
numerous
instances
plundered
of
their
property
and
deprived
of
their
personal
liberty
if
they
dared
insist
on
their
rights
had
the
unlawful
seizures
of
american
property
and
the
violation
of
the
personal
liberty
of
our
citizens
to
say
nothing
of
the
insults
to
our
flag
which
have
occurred
in
the
ports
of
mexico
taken
place
on
the
high
seas
they
would
themselves
long
since
have
constituted
a
state
of
actual
war
between
the
two
countries
in
so
long
suffering
mexico
to
violate
her
most
solemn
treaty
obligations
plunder
our
citizens
of
their
property
and
imprison
their
persons
without
affording
them
any
redress
we
have
failed
to
perform
one
of
the
first
and
highest
duties
which
every
government
owes
to
its
citizens
and
the
consequence
has
been
that
many
of
them
have
been
reduced
from
a
state
of
affluence
to
bankruptcy
the
proud
name
of
american
citizen
which
ought
to
protect
all
who
bear
it
from
insult
and
injury
throughout
the
world
has
afforded
no
such
protection
to
our
citizens
in
mexico
we
had
ample
cause
of
war
against
mexico
long
before
the
breaking
out
of
hostilities
but
even
then
we
forbore
to
take
redress
into
our
own
hands
until
mexico
herself
became
the
aggressor
by
invading
our
soil
in
hostile
array
and
shedding
the
blood
of
our
citizens
such
are
the
grave
causes
of
complaint
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
against
mexicocauses
which
existed
long
before
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
american
union
and
yet
animated
by
the
love
of
peace
and
a
magnanimous
moderation
we
did
not
adopt
those
measures
of
redress
which
under
such
circumstances
are
the
justified
resort
of
injured
nations
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
constituted
no
just
cause
of
offense
to
mexico
the
pretext
that
it
did
so
is
wholly
inconsistent
and
irreconcilable
with
wellauthenticated
facts
connected
with
the
revolution
by
which
texas
became
independent
of
mexico
that
this
may
be
the
more
manifest
it
may
be
proper
to
advert
to
the
causes
and
to
the
history
of
the
principal
events
of
that
revolution
texas
constituted
a
portion
of
the
ancient
province
of
louisiana
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
in
the
year
in
the
year
the
united
states
by
the
florida
treaty
ceded
to
spain
all
that
part
of
louisiana
within
the
present
limits
of
texas
and
mexico
by
the
revolution
which
separated
her
from
spain
and
rendered
her
an
independent
nation
succeeded
to
the
rights
of
the
mother
country
over
this
territory
in
the
year
mexico
established
a
federal
constitution
under
which
the
mexican
republic
was
composed
of
a
number
of
sovereign
states
confederated
together
in
a
federal
union
similar
to
our
own
each
of
these
states
had
its
own
executive
legislature
and
judiciary
and
for
all
except
federal
purposes
was
as
independent
of
the
general
government
and
that
of
the
other
states
as
is
pennsylvania
or
virginia
under
our
constitution
texas
and
coahuila
united
and
formed
one
of
these
mexican
states
the
state
constitution
which
they
adopted
and
which
was
approved
by
the
mexican
confederacy
asserted
that
they
were
free
and
independent
of
the
other
mexican
united
states
and
of
every
other
power
and
dominion
whatsoever
and
proclaimed
the
great
principle
of
human
liberty
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
resides
originally
and
essentially
in
the
general
mass
of
the
individuals
who
compose
it
to
the
government
under
this
constitution
as
well
as
to
that
under
the
federal
constitution
the
people
of
texas
owed
allegiance
emigrants
from
foreign
countries
including
the
united
states
were
invited
by
the
colonization
laws
of
the
state
and
of
the
federal
government
to
settle
in
texas
advantageous
terms
were
offered
to
induce
them
to
leave
their
own
country
and
become
mexican
citizens
this
invitation
was
accepted
by
many
of
our
citizens
in
the
full
faith
that
in
their
new
home
they
would
be
governed
by
laws
enacted
by
representatives
elected
by
themselves
and
that
their
lives
liberty
and
property
would
be
protected
by
constitutional
guaranties
similar
to
those
which
existed
in
the
republic
they
had
left
under
a
government
thus
organized
they
continued
until
the
year
when
a
military
revolution
broke
out
in
the
city
of
mexico
which
entirely
subverted
the
federal
and
state
constitutions
and
placed
a
military
dictator
at
the
head
of
the
government
by
a
sweeping
decree
of
a
congress
subservient
to
the
will
of
the
dictator
the
several
state
constitutions
were
abolished
and
the
states
themselves
converted
into
mere
departments
of
the
central
government
the
people
of
texas
were
unwilling
to
submit
to
this
usurpation
resistance
to
such
tyranny
became
a
high
duty
texas
was
fully
absolved
from
all
allegiance
to
the
central
government
of
mexico
from
the
moment
that
government
had
abolished
her
state
constitution
and
in
its
place
substituted
an
arbitrary
and
despotic
central
government
such
were
the
principal
causes
of
the
texan
revolution
the
people
of
texas
at
once
determined
upon
resistance
and
flew
to
arms
in
the
midst
of
these
important
and
exciting
events
however
they
did
not
omit
to
place
their
liberties
upon
a
secure
and
permanent
foundation
they
elected
members
to
a
convention
who
in
the
month
of
march
issued
a
formal
declaration
that
their
political
connection
with
the
mexican
nation
has
forever
ended
and
that
the
people
of
texas
do
now
constitute
a
free
sovereign
and
independent
republic
and
are
fully
invested
with
all
the
rights
and
attributes
which
properly
belong
to
independent
nations
they
also
adopted
for
their
government
a
liberal
republican
constitution
about
the
same
time
santa
anna
then
the
dictator
of
mexico
invaded
texas
with
a
numerous
army
for
the
purpose
of
subduing
her
people
and
enforcing
obedience
to
his
arbitrary
and
despotic
government
on
the
st
of
april
he
was
met
by
the
texan
citizen
soldiers
and
on
that
day
was
achieved
by
them
the
memorable
victory
of
san
jacinto
by
which
they
conquered
their
independence
considering
the
numbers
engaged
on
the
respective
sides
history
does
not
record
a
more
brilliant
achievement
santa
anna
himself
was
among
the
captives
in
the
month
of
may
santa
anna
acknowledged
by
a
treaty
with
the
texan
authorities
in
the
most
solemn
form
the
full
entire
and
perfect
independence
of
the
republic
of
texas
it
is
true
he
was
then
a
prisoner
of
war
but
it
is
equally
true
that
he
had
failed
to
reconquer
texas
and
had
met
with
signal
defeat
that
his
authority
had
not
been
revoked
and
that
by
virtue
of
this
treaty
he
obtained
his
personal
release
by
it
hostilities
were
suspended
and
the
army
which
had
invaded
texas
under
his
command
returned
in
pursuance
of
this
arrangement
unmolested
to
mexico
from
the
day
that
the
battle
of
san
jacinto
was
fought
until
the
present
hour
mexico
has
never
possessed
the
power
to
reconquer
texas
in
the
language
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
in
a
dispatch
to
our
minister
in
mexico
under
date
of
the
th
of
july
mexico
may
have
chosen
to
consider
and
may
still
choose
to
consider
texas
as
having
been
at
all
times
since
and
as
still
continuing
a
rebellious
province
but
the
world
has
been
obliged
to
take
a
very
different
view
of
the
matter
from
the
time
of
the
battle
of
san
jacinto
in
april
to
the
present
moment
texas
has
exhibited
the
same
external
signs
of
national
independence
as
mexico
herself
and
with
quite
as
much
stability
of
government
practically
free
and
independent
acknowledged
as
a
political
sovereignty
by
the
principal
powers
of
the
world
no
hostile
foot
finding
rest
within
her
territory
for
six
or
seven
years
and
mexico
herself
refraining
for
all
that
period
from
any
further
attempt
to
reestablish
her
own
authority
over
that
territory
it
can
not
but
be
surprising
to
find
mr
de
bocanegra
the
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
of
mexico
complaining
that
for
that
whole
period
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
its
government
have
been
favoring
the
rebels
of
texas
and
supplying
them
with
vessels
ammunition
and
money
as
if
the
war
for
the
reduction
of
the
province
of
texas
had
been
constantly
prosecuted
by
mexico
and
her
success
prevented
by
these
influences
from
abroad
in
the
same
dispatch
the
secretary
of
state
affirms
that
since
the
united
states
have
regarded
texas
as
an
independent
sovereignty
as
much
as
mexico
and
that
trade
and
commerce
with
citizens
of
a
government
at
war
with
mexico
can
not
on
that
account
be
regarded
as
an
intercourse
by
which
assistance
and
succor
are
given
to
mexican
rebels
the
whole
current
of
mr
de
bocanegras
remarks
runs
in
the
same
direction
as
if
the
independence
of
texas
had
not
been
acknowledged
it
has
been
acknowledged
it
was
acknowledged
in
against
the
remonstrance
and
protest
of
mexico
and
most
of
the
acts
of
any
importance
of
which
mr
de
bocanegra
complains
flow
necessarily
from
that
recognition
he
speaks
of
texas
as
still
being
an
integral
part
of
the
territory
of
the
mexican
republic
but
he
can
not
but
understand
that
the
united
states
do
not
so
regard
it
the
real
complai
nt
of
mexico
therefore
is
in
substance
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
complaint
against
the
recognition
of
texan
independence
it
may
be
thought
rather
late
to
repeat
that
complaint
and
not
quite
just
to
confine
it
to
the
united
states
to
the
exemption
of
england
france
and
belgium
unless
the
united
states
having
been
the
first
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
mexico
herself
are
to
be
blamed
for
setting
an
example
for
the
recognition
of
that
of
texas
and
he
added
that
the
constitution
public
treaties
and
the
laws
oblige
the
president
to
regard
texas
as
an
independent
state
and
its
territory
as
no
part
of
the
territory
of
mexico
texas
had
been
an
independent
state
with
an
organized
government
defying
the
power
of
mexico
to
overthrow
or
reconquer
her
for
more
than
ten
years
before
mexico
commenced
the
present
war
against
the
united
states
texas
had
given
such
evidence
to
the
world
of
her
ability
to
maintain
her
separate
existence
as
an
independent
nation
that
she
had
been
formally
recognized
as
such
not
only
by
the
united
states
but
by
several
of
the
principal
powers
of
europe
these
powers
had
entered
into
treaties
of
amity
commerce
and
navigation
with
her
they
had
received
and
accredited
her
ministers
and
other
diplomatic
agents
at
their
respective
courts
and
they
had
commissioned
ministers
and
diplomatic
agents
on
their
part
to
the
government
of
texas
if
mexico
notwithstanding
all
this
and
her
utter
inability
to
subdue
or
reconquer
texas
still
stubbornly
refused
to
recognize
her
as
an
independent
nation
she
was
none
the
less
so
on
that
account
mexico
herself
had
been
recognized
as
an
independent
nation
by
the
united
states
and
by
other
powers
many
years
before
spain
of
which
before
her
revolution
she
had
been
a
colony
would
agree
to
recognize
her
as
such
and
yet
mexico
was
at
that
time
in
the
estimation
of
the
civilized
world
and
in
fact
none
the
less
an
independent
power
because
spain
still
claimed
her
as
a
colony
if
spain
had
continued
until
the
present
period
to
assert
that
mexico
was
one
of
her
colonies
in
rebellion
against
her
this
would
not
have
made
her
so
or
changed
the
fact
of
her
independent
existence
texas
at
the
period
of
her
annexation
to
the
united
states
bore
the
same
relation
to
mexico
that
mexico
had
borne
to
spain
for
many
years
before
spain
acknowledged
her
independence
with
this
important
difference
that
before
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
was
consummated
mexico
herself
by
a
formal
act
of
her
government
had
acknowledged
the
independence
of
texas
as
a
nation
it
is
true
that
in
the
act
of
recognition
she
prescribed
a
condition
which
she
had
no
power
or
authority
to
imposethat
texas
should
not
annex
herself
to
any
other
powerbut
this
could
not
detract
in
any
degree
from
the
recognition
which
mexico
then
made
of
her
actual
independence
upon
this
plain
statement
of
facts
it
is
absurd
for
mexico
to
allege
as
a
pretext
for
commencing
hostilities
against
the
united
states
that
texas
is
still
a
part
of
her
territory
but
there
are
those
who
conceding
all
this
to
be
true
assume
the
ground
that
the
true
western
boundary
of
texas
is
the
nueces
instead
of
the
rio
grande
and
that
therefore
in
marching
our
army
to
the
east
bank
of
the
latter
river
we
passed
the
texan
line
and
invaded
the
territory
of
mexico
a
simple
statement
of
facts
known
to
exist
will
conclusively
refute
such
an
assumption
texas
as
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
in
has
been
always
claimed
as
extending
west
to
the
rio
grande
or
rio
bravo
this
fact
is
established
by
the
authority
of
our
most
eminent
statesmen
at
a
period
when
the
question
was
as
well
if
not
better
understood
than
it
is
at
present
during
mr
jeffersons
administration
messrs
monroe
and
pinckney
who
had
been
sent
on
a
special
mission
to
madrid
charged
among
other
things
with
the
adjustment
of
boundary
between
the
two
countries
in
a
note
addressed
to
the
spanish
minister
of
foreign
affairs
under
date
of
the
th
of
january
assert
that
the
boundaries
of
louisiana
as
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
are
the
river
perdido
on
the
east
and
the
river
bravo
on
the
west
and
they
add
that
the
facts
and
principles
which
justify
this
conclusion
are
so
satisfactory
to
our
government
as
to
convince
it
that
the
united
states
have
not
a
better
right
to
the
island
of
new
orleans
under
the
cession
referred
to
than
they
have
to
the
whole
district
of
territory
which
is
above
described
down
to
the
conclusion
of
the
florida
treaty
in
february
by
which
this
territory
was
ceded
to
spain
the
united
states
asserted
and
maintained
their
territorial
rights
to
this
extent
in
the
month
of
june
during
mr
monroes
administration
information
having
been
received
that
a
number
of
foreign
adventurers
had
landed
at
galveston
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
forming
a
settlement
in
that
vicinity
a
special
messenger
was
dispatched
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
instructions
from
the
secretary
of
state
to
warn
them
to
desist
should
they
be
found
there
or
any
other
place
north
of
the
rio
bravo
and
within
the
territory
claimed
by
the
united
states
he
was
instructed
should
they
be
found
in
the
country
north
of
that
river
to
make
known
to
them
the
surprise
with
which
the
president
has
seen
possession
thus
taken
without
authority
from
the
united
states
of
a
place
within
their
territorial
limits
and
upon
which
no
lawful
settlement
can
be
made
without
their
sanction
he
was
instructed
to
call
upon
them
to
avow
under
what
national
authority
they
profess
to
act
and
to
give
them
due
warning
that
the
place
is
within
the
united
states
who
will
suffer
no
permanent
settlement
to
be
made
there
under
any
authority
other
than
their
own
as
late
as
the
th
of
july
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
in
a
note
addressed
to
our
minister
in
mexico
maintains
that
by
the
florida
treaty
of
the
territory
as
far
west
as
the
rio
grande
was
confirmed
to
spain
in
that
note
he
states
that
by
the
treaty
of
the
d
of
february
between
the
united
states
and
spain
the
sabine
was
adopted
as
the
line
of
boundary
between
the
two
powers
up
to
that
period
no
considerable
colonization
had
been
effected
in
texas
but
the
territory
between
the
sabine
and
the
rio
grande
being
confirmed
to
spain
by
the
treaty
applications
were
made
to
that
power
for
grants
of
land
and
such
grants
or
permissions
of
settlement
were
in
fact
made
by
the
spanish
authorities
in
favor
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
proposing
to
emigrate
to
texas
in
numerous
families
before
the
declaration
of
independence
by
mexico
the
texas
which
was
ceded
to
spain
by
the
florida
treaty
of
embraced
all
the
country
now
claimed
by
the
state
of
texas
between
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
the
republic
of
texas
always
claimed
this
river
as
her
western
boundary
and
in
her
treaty
made
with
santa
anna
in
may
he
recognized
it
as
such
by
the
constitution
which
texas
adopted
in
march
senatorial
and
representative
districts
were
organized
extending
west
of
the
nueces
the
congress
of
texas
on
the
th
of
december
passed
an
act
to
define
the
boundaries
of
the
republic
of
texas
in
which
they
declared
the
rio
grande
from
its
mouth
to
its
source
to
be
their
boundary
and
by
the
said
act
they
extended
their
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
over
the
country
up
to
that
boundary
during
a
period
of
more
than
nine
years
which
intervened
between
the
adoption
of
her
constitution
and
her
annexation
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union
texas
asserted
and
exercised
many
acts
of
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
over
the
territory
and
inhabitants
west
of
the
nueces
she
organized
and
defined
the
limits
of
counties
extending
to
the
rio
grande
she
established
courts
of
justice
and
extended
her
judicial
system
over
the
territory
she
established
a
customhouse
and
collected
duties
and
also
postoffices
and
postroads
in
it
she
established
a
land
office
and
issued
numerous
grants
for
land
within
its
limits
a
senator
and
a
representative
residing
in
it
were
elected
to
the
congress
of
the
republic
and
served
as
such
before
the
act
of
annexation
took
place
in
both
the
congress
and
convention
of
texas
which
gave
their
assent
to
the
terms
of
annexation
to
the
united
states
proposed
by
our
congress
were
representatives
residing
west
of
the
nueces
who
took
part
in
the
act
of
annexation
itself
this
was
the
texas
which
by
the
act
of
our
congress
of
the
th
of
december
was
admitted
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
understood
the
state
of
texas
which
they
admitted
into
the
union
to
extend
beyond
the
nueces
is
apparent
from
the
fact
that
on
the
st
of
december
only
two
days
after
the
act
of
admission
they
passed
a
law
to
establish
a
collection
district
in
the
state
of
texas
by
which
they
created
a
port
of
delivery
at
corpus
christi
situated
west
of
the
nueces
and
being
the
same
point
at
which
the
texas
customhouse
under
the
laws
of
that
republic
had
been
located
and
directed
that
a
surveyor
to
collect
the
revenue
should
be
appointed
for
that
port
by
the
president
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
a
surveyor
was
accordingly
nominated
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
and
has
been
ever
since
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
all
these
acts
of
the
republic
of
texas
and
of
our
congress
preceded
the
orders
for
the
advance
of
our
army
to
the
east
bank
of
the
rio
grande
subsequently
congress
passed
an
act
establishing
certain
post
routes
extending
west
of
the
nueces
the
country
west
of
that
river
now
constitutes
a
part
of
one
of
the
congressional
districts
of
texas
and
is
represented
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
senators
from
that
state
were
chosen
by
a
legislature
in
which
the
country
west
of
that
river
was
represented
in
view
of
all
these
facts
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
upon
what
ground
it
can
be
maintained
that
in
occupying
the
country
west
of
the
nueces
with
our
army
with
a
view
solely
to
its
security
and
defense
we
invaded
the
territory
of
mexico
but
it
would
have
been
still
more
difficult
to
justify
the
executive
whose
duty
it
is
to
see
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
execu
ted
if
in
the
face
of
all
these
proceedings
both
of
the
congress
of
texas
and
of
the
united
states
he
had
assumed
the
responsibility
of
yielding
up
the
territory
west
of
the
nueces
to
mexico
or
of
refusing
to
protect
and
defend
this
territory
and
its
inhabitants
including
corpus
christi
as
well
as
the
remainder
of
texas
against
the
threatened
mexican
invasion
but
mexico
herself
has
never
placed
the
war
which
she
has
waged
upon
the
ground
that
our
army
occupied
the
intermediate
territory
between
the
nueces
and
the
rio
grande
her
refuted
pretension
that
texas
was
not
in
fact
an
independent
state
but
a
rebellious
province
was
obstinately
persevered
in
and
her
avowed
purpose
in
commencing
a
war
with
the
united
states
was
to
reconquer
texas
and
to
restore
mexican
authority
over
the
whole
territorynot
to
the
nueces
only
but
to
the
sabine
in
view
of
the
proclaimed
menaces
of
mexico
to
this
effect
i
deemed
it
my
duty
as
a
measure
of
precaution
and
defense
to
order
our
army
to
occupy
a
position
on
our
frontier
as
a
military
post
from
which
our
troops
could
best
resist
and
repel
any
attempted
invasion
which
mexico
might
make
our
army
had
occupied
a
position
at
corpus
christi
west
of
the
nueces
as
early
as
august
without
complaint
from
any
quarter
had
the
nueces
been
regarded
as
the
true
western
boundary
of
texas
that
boundary
had
been
passed
by
our
army
many
months
before
it
advanced
to
the
eastern
bank
of
the
rio
grande
in
my
annual
message
of
december
last
i
informed
congress
that
upon
the
invitation
of
both
the
congress
and
convention
of
texas
i
had
deemed
it
proper
to
order
a
strong
squadron
to
the
coasts
of
mexico
and
to
concentrate
an
efficient
military
force
on
the
western
frontier
of
texas
to
protect
and
defend
the
inhabitants
against
the
menaced
invasion
of
mexico
in
that
message
i
informed
congress
that
the
moment
the
terms
of
annexation
offered
by
the
united
states
were
accepted
by
texas
the
latter
became
so
far
a
part
of
our
own
country
as
to
make
it
our
duty
to
afford
such
protection
and
defense
and
that
for
that
purpose
our
squadron
had
been
ordered
to
the
gulf
and
our
army
to
take
a
position
between
the
nueces
and
the
del
norte
or
rio
grande
and
to
repel
any
invasion
of
the
texan
territory
which
might
be
attempted
by
the
mexican
forces
it
was
deemed
proper
to
issue
this
order
because
soon
after
the
president
of
texas
in
april
had
issued
his
proclamation
convening
the
congress
of
that
republic
for
the
purpose
of
submitting
to
that
body
the
terms
of
annexation
proposed
by
the
united
states
the
government
of
mexico
made
serious
threats
of
invading
the
texan
territory
these
threats
became
more
imposing
as
it
became
more
apparent
in
the
progress
of
the
question
that
the
people
of
texas
would
decide
in
favor
of
accepting
the
terms
of
annexation
and
finally
they
had
assumed
such
a
formidable
character
as
induced
both
the
congress
and
convention
of
texas
to
request
that
a
military
force
should
be
sent
by
the
united
states
into
her
territory
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
and
defending
her
against
the
threatened
invasion
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
good
faith
toward
the
people
of
texas
to
have
refused
to
afford
the
aid
which
they
desired
against
a
threatened
invasion
to
which
they
had
been
exposed
by
their
free
determination
to
annex
themselves
to
our
union
in
compliance
with
the
overture
made
to
them
by
the
joint
resolution
of
our
congress
accordingly
a
portion
of
the
army
was
ordered
to
advance
into
texas
corpus
christi
was
the
position
selected
by
general
taylor
he
encamped
at
that
place
in
august
and
the
army
remained
in
that
position
until
the
th
of
march
when
it
moved
westward
and
on
the
th
of
that
month
reached
the
east
bank
of
the
rio
grande
opposite
to
matamoras
this
movement
was
made
in
pursuance
of
orders
from
the
war
department
issued
on
the
th
of
january
before
these
orders
were
issued
the
dispatch
of
our
minister
in
mexico
transmitting
the
decision
of
the
council
of
government
of
mexico
advising
that
he
should
not
be
received
and
also
the
dispatch
of
our
consul
residing
in
the
city
of
mexico
the
former
bearing
date
on
the
th
and
the
latter
on
the
th
of
december
copies
of
both
of
which
accompanied
my
message
to
congress
of
the
th
of
may
last
were
received
at
the
department
of
state
these
communications
rendered
it
highly
probable
if
not
absolutely
certain
that
our
minister
would
not
be
received
by
the
government
of
general
herrera
it
was
also
well
known
that
but
little
hope
could
be
entertained
of
a
different
result
from
general
paredes
in
case
the
revolutionary
movement
which
he
was
prosecuting
should
prove
successful
as
was
highly
probable
the
partisans
of
paredes
as
our
minister
in
the
dispatch
referred
to
states
breathed
the
fiercest
hostility
against
the
united
states
denounced
the
proposed
negotiation
as
treason
and
openly
called
upon
the
troops
and
the
people
to
put
down
the
government
of
herrera
by
force
the
reconquest
of
texas
and
war
with
the
united
states
were
openly
threatened
these
were
the
circumstances
existing
when
it
was
deemed
proper
to
order
the
army
under
the
command
of
general
taylor
to
advance
to
the
western
frontier
of
texas
and
occupy
a
position
on
or
near
the
rio
grande
the
apprehensions
of
a
contemplated
mexican
invasion
have
been
since
fully
justified
by
the
event
the
determination
of
mexico
to
rush
into
hostilities
with
the
united
states
was
afterwards
manifested
from
the
whole
tenor
of
the
note
of
the
mexican
minister
of
foreign
affairs
to
our
minister
bearing
date
on
the
th
of
march
paredes
had
then
revolutionized
the
government
and
his
minister
after
referring
to
the
resolution
for
the
annexation
of
texas
which
had
been
adopted
by
our
congress
in
march
proceeds
to
declare
that
a
fact
such
as
this
or
to
speak
with
greater
exactness
so
notable
an
act
of
usurpation
created
an
imperious
necessity
that
mexico
for
her
own
honor
should
repel
it
with
proper
firmness
and
dignity
the
supreme
government
had
beforehand
declared
that
it
would
look
upon
such
an
act
as
a
casus
belli
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
declaration
negotiation
was
by
its
very
nature
at
an
end
and
war
was
the
only
recourse
of
the
mexican
government
it
appears
also
that
on
the
th
of
april
following
general
paredes
through
his
minister
of
war
issued
orders
to
the
mexican
general
in
command
on
the
texan
frontier
to
attack
our
army
by
every
means
which
war
permits
to
this
general
paredes
had
been
pledged
to
the
army
and
people
of
mexico
during
the
military
revolution
which
had
brought
him
into
power
on
the
th
of
april
general
paredes
addressed
a
letter
to
the
commander
on
that
frontier
in
which
he
stated
to
him
at
the
present
date
i
suppose
you
at
the
head
of
that
valiant
army
either
fighting
already
or
preparing
for
the
operations
of
a
campaign
and
supposing
you
already
on
the
theater
of
operations
and
with
all
the
forces
assembled
it
is
indispensable
that
hostilities
be
commenced
yourself
taking
the
initiative
against
the
enemy
the
movement
of
our
army
to
the
rio
grande
was
made
by
the
commanding
general
under
positive
orders
to
abstain
from
all
aggressive
acts
toward
mexico
or
mexican
citizens
and
to
regard
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
as
peaceful
unless
mexico
should
declare
war
or
commit
acts
of
hostility
indicative
of
a
state
of
war
and
these
orders
he
faithfully
executed
whilst
occupying
his
position
on
the
east
bank
of
the
rio
grande
within
the
limits
of
texas
then
recently
admitted
as
one
of
the
states
of
our
union
the
commanding
general
of
the
mexican
forces
who
in
pursuance
of
the
orders
of
his
government
had
collected
a
large
army
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
rio
grande
crossed
the
river
invaded
our
territory
and
commenced
hostilities
by
attacking
our
forces
thus
after
all
the
injuries
which
we
had
received
and
borne
from
mexico
and
after
she
had
insultingly
rejected
a
minister
sent
to
her
on
a
mission
of
peace
and
whom
she
had
solemnly
agreed
to
receive
she
consummated
her
long
course
of
outrage
against
our
country
by
commencing
an
offensive
war
and
shedding
the
blood
of
our
citizens
on
our
own
soil
the
united
states
never
attempted
to
acquire
texas
by
conquest
on
the
contrary
at
an
early
period
after
the
people
of
texas
had
achieved
their
independence
they
sought
to
be
annexed
to
the
united
states
at
a
general
election
in
september
they
decided
with
great
unanimity
in
favor
of
annexation
and
in
november
following
the
congress
of
the
republic
authorized
the
appointment
of
a
minister
to
bear
their
request
to
this
government
this
government
however
having
remained
neutral
between
texas
and
mexico
during
the
war
between
them
and
considering
it
due
to
the
honor
of
our
country
and
our
fair
fame
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
that
we
should
not
at
this
early
period
consent
to
annexation
nor
until
it
should
be
manifest
to
the
whole
world
that
the
reconquest
of
texas
by
mexico
was
impossible
refused
to
accede
to
the
overtures
made
by
texas
on
the
th
of
april
after
more
than
seven
years
had
elapsed
since
texas
had
established
her
independence
a
treaty
was
concluded
for
the
annexation
of
that
republic
to
the
united
states
which
was
rejected
by
the
senate
finally
on
the
st
of
march
congress
passed
a
joint
resolution
for
annexing
her
to
the
united
states
upon
certain
preliminary
conditions
to
which
her
assent
was
required
the
solemnities
which
characterized
the
deliberations
and
conduct
of
the
government
and
people
of
texas
on
the
deeply
interesting
questions
presented
by
these
resolutions
are
known
to
the
world
the
congress
the
executive
and
the
people
of
texas
in
a
convention
elected
for
that
purpose
accepted
with
great
unanimity
the
proposed
terms
of
annexation
and
thus
consummated
on
her
part
the
great
act
of
restoring
to
our
federal
union
a
vast
territory
which
had
been
ceded
to
spain
by
the
florida
treaty
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
after
the
joint
resolution
for
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
had
been
passed
by
our
congress
the
mexican
minister
at
washington
addres
sed
a
note
to
the
secretary
of
state
bearing
date
on
the
th
of
march
protesting
against
it
as
an
act
of
aggression
the
most
unjust
which
can
be
found
recorded
in
the
annals
of
modern
history
namely
that
of
despoiling
a
friendly
nation
like
mexico
of
a
considerable
portion
of
her
territory
and
protesting
against
the
resolution
of
annexation
as
being
an
act
whereby
the
province
of
texas
an
integral
portion
of
the
mexican
territory
is
agreed
and
admitted
into
the
american
union
and
he
announced
that
as
a
consequence
his
mission
to
the
united
states
had
terminated
and
demanded
his
passports
which
were
granted
it
was
upon
the
absurd
pretext
made
by
mexico
herself
indebted
for
her
independence
to
a
successful
revolution
that
the
republic
of
texas
still
continued
to
be
notwithstanding
all
that
had
passed
a
province
of
mexico
that
this
step
was
taken
by
the
mexican
minister
every
honorable
effort
has
been
used
by
me
to
avoid
the
war
which
followed
but
all
have
proved
vain
all
our
attempts
to
preserve
peace
have
been
met
by
insult
and
resistance
on
the
part
of
mexico
my
efforts
to
this
end
commenced
in
the
note
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
th
of
march
in
answer
to
that
of
the
mexican
minister
whilst
declining
to
reopen
a
discussion
which
had
already
been
exhausted
and
proving
again
what
was
known
to
the
whole
world
that
texas
had
long
since
achieved
her
independence
the
secretary
of
state
expressed
the
regret
of
this
government
that
mexico
should
have
taken
offense
at
the
resolution
of
annexation
passed
by
congress
and
gave
assurance
that
our
most
strenuous
efforts
shall
be
devoted
to
the
amicable
adjustment
of
every
cause
of
complaint
between
the
two
governments
and
to
the
cultivation
of
the
kindest
and
most
friendly
relations
between
the
sister
republics
that
i
have
acted
in
the
spirit
of
this
assurance
will
appear
from
the
events
which
have
since
occurred
notwithstanding
mexico
had
abruptly
terminated
all
diplomatic
intercourse
with
the
united
states
and
ought
therefore
to
have
been
the
first
to
ask
for
its
resumption
yet
waiving
all
ceremony
i
embraced
the
earliest
favorable
opportunity
to
ascertain
from
the
mexican
government
whether
they
would
receive
an
envoy
from
the
united
states
intrusted
with
full
power
to
adjust
all
the
questions
in
dispute
between
the
two
governments
in
september
i
believed
the
propitious
moment
for
such
an
overture
had
arrived
texas
by
the
enthusiastic
and
almost
unanimous
will
of
her
people
had
pronounced
in
favor
of
annexation
mexico
herself
had
agreed
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
texas
subject
to
a
condition
it
is
true
which
she
had
no
right
to
impose
and
no
power
to
enforce
the
last
lingering
hope
of
mexico
if
she
still
could
have
retained
any
that
texas
would
ever
again
become
one
of
her
provinces
must
have
been
abandoned
the
consul
of
the
united
states
at
the
city
of
mexico
was
therefore
instructed
by
the
secretary
of
state
on
the
th
of
september
to
make
the
inquiry
of
the
mexican
government
the
inquiry
was
made
and
on
the
th
of
october
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
the
mexican
government
in
a
note
addressed
to
our
consul
gave
a
favorable
response
requesting
at
the
same
time
that
our
naval
force
might
be
withdrawn
from
vera
cruz
while
negotiations
should
be
pending
upon
the
receipt
of
this
note
our
naval
force
was
promptly
withdrawn
from
vera
cruz
a
minister
was
immediately
appointed
and
departed
to
mexico
everything
bore
a
promising
aspect
for
a
speedy
and
peaceful
adjustment
of
all
our
difficulties
at
the
date
of
my
annual
message
to
congress
in
december
last
no
doubt
was
entertained
but
that
he
would
be
received
by
the
mexican
government
and
the
hope
was
cherished
that
all
cause
of
misunderstanding
between
the
two
countries
would
be
speedily
removed
in
the
confident
hope
that
such
would
be
the
result
of
his
mission
i
informed
congress
that
i
forbore
at
that
time
to
recommend
such
ulterior
measures
of
redress
for
the
wrongs
and
injuries
we
had
so
long
borne
as
it
would
have
been
proper
to
make
had
no
such
negotiation
been
instituted
to
my
surprise
and
regret
the
mexican
government
though
solemnly
pledged
to
do
so
upon
the
arrival
of
our
minister
in
mexico
refused
to
receive
and
accredit
him
when
he
reached
vera
cruz
on
the
th
of
november
he
found
that
the
aspect
of
affairs
had
undergone
an
unhappy
change
the
government
of
general
herrera
who
was
at
that
time
president
of
the
republic
was
tottering
to
its
fall
general
paredes
a
military
leader
had
manifested
his
determination
to
overthrow
the
government
of
herrera
by
a
military
revolution
and
one
of
the
principal
means
which
he
employed
to
effect
his
purpose
and
render
the
government
of
herrera
odious
to
the
army
and
people
of
mexico
was
by
loudly
condemning
its
determination
to
receive
a
minister
of
peace
from
the
united
states
alleging
that
it
was
the
intention
of
herrera
by
a
treaty
with
the
united
states
to
dismember
the
territory
of
mexico
by
ceding
away
the
department
of
texas
the
government
of
herrera
is
believed
to
have
been
well
disposed
to
a
pacific
adjustment
of
existing
difficulties
but
probably
alarmed
for
its
own
security
and
in
order
to
ward
off
the
danger
of
the
revolution
led
by
paredes
violated
its
solemn
agreement
and
refused
to
receive
or
accredit
our
minister
and
this
although
informed
that
he
had
been
invested
with
full
power
to
adjust
all
questions
in
dispute
between
the
two
governments
among
the
frivolous
pretexts
for
this
refusal
the
principal
one
was
that
our
minister
had
not
gone
upon
a
special
mission
confined
to
the
question
of
texas
alone
leaving
all
the
outrages
upon
our
flag
and
our
citizens
unredressed
the
mexican
government
well
knew
that
both
our
national
honor
and
the
protection
due
to
our
citizens
imperatively
required
that
the
two
questions
of
boundary
and
indemnity
should
be
treated
of
together
as
naturally
and
inseparably
blended
and
they
ought
to
have
seen
that
this
course
was
best
calculated
to
enable
the
united
states
to
extend
to
them
the
most
liberal
justice
on
the
th
of
december
general
herrera
resigned
the
presidency
and
yielded
up
the
government
to
general
paredes
without
a
struggle
thus
a
revolution
was
accomplished
solely
by
the
army
commanded
by
paredes
and
the
supreme
power
in
mexico
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
military
usurper
who
was
known
to
be
bitterly
hostile
to
the
united
states
although
the
prospect
of
a
pacific
adjustment
with
the
new
government
was
unpromising
from
the
known
hostility
of
its
head
to
the
united
states
yet
determined
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
on
our
part
to
restore
friendly
relations
between
the
two
countries
our
minister
was
instructed
to
present
his
credentials
to
the
new
government
and
ask
to
be
accredited
by
it
in
the
diplomatic
character
in
which
he
had
been
commissioned
these
instructions
he
executed
by
his
note
of
the
st
of
march
addressed
to
the
mexican
minister
of
foreign
affairs
but
his
request
was
insultingly
refused
by
that
minister
in
his
answer
of
the
th
of
the
same
month
no
alternative
remained
for
our
minister
but
to
demand
his
passports
and
return
to
the
united
states
thus
was
the
extraordinary
spectacle
presented
to
the
civilized
world
of
a
government
in
violation
of
its
own
express
agreement
having
twice
rejected
a
minister
of
peace
invested
with
full
powers
to
adjust
all
the
existing
differences
between
the
two
countries
in
a
manner
just
and
honorable
to
both
i
am
not
aware
that
modern
history
presents
a
parallel
case
in
which
in
time
of
peace
one
nation
has
refused
even
to
hear
propositions
from
another
for
terminating
existing
difficulties
between
them
scarcely
a
hope
of
adjusting
our
difficulties
even
at
a
remote
day
or
of
preserving
peace
with
mexico
could
be
cherished
while
paredes
remained
at
the
head
of
the
government
he
had
acquired
the
supreme
power
by
a
military
revolution
and
upon
the
most
solemn
pledges
to
wage
war
against
the
united
states
and
to
reconquer
texas
which
he
claimed
as
a
revolted
province
of
mexico
he
had
denounced
as
guilty
of
treason
all
those
mexicans
who
considered
texas
as
no
longer
constituting
a
part
of
the
territory
of
mexico
and
who
were
friendly
to
the
cause
of
peace
the
duration
of
the
war
which
he
waged
against
the
united
states
was
indefinite
because
the
end
which
he
proposed
of
the
reconquest
of
texas
was
hopeless
besides
there
was
good
reason
to
believe
from
all
his
conduct
that
it
was
his
intention
to
convert
the
republic
of
mexico
into
a
monarchy
and
to
call
a
foreign
european
prince
to
the
throne
preparatory
to
this
end
he
had
during
his
short
rule
destroyed
the
liberty
of
the
press
tolerating
that
portion
of
it
only
which
openly
advocated
the
establishment
of
a
monarchy
the
better
to
secure
the
success
of
his
ultimate
designs
he
had
by
an
arbitrary
decree
convoked
a
congress
not
to
be
elected
by
the
free
voice
of
the
people
but
to
be
chosen
in
a
manner
to
make
them
subservient
to
his
will
and
to
give
him
absolute
control
over
their
deliberations
under
all
these
circumstances
it
was
believed
that
any
revolution
in
mexico
founded
upon
opposition
to
the
ambitious
projects
of
paredes
would
tend
to
promote
the
cause
of
peace
as
well
as
prevent
any
attempted
european
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
north
american
continent
both
objects
of
deep
interest
to
the
united
states
any
such
foreign
interference
if
attempted
must
have
been
resisted
by
the
united
states
my
views
upon
that
subject
were
fully
communicated
to
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
in
any
event
it
was
certain
that
no
change
whatever
in
the
government
of
mexico
which
would
deprive
paredes
of
power
could
be
for
the
worse
so
far
as
the
united
states
were
concerned
while
it
was
highly
probable
that
any
change
must
be
for
the
better
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
existing
when
congress
on
the
th
of
may
last
recognized
the
existence
of
the
war
which
had
been
commenced
by
the
government
of
paredes
and
it
became
an
object
of
much
importance
with
a
view
to
a
speedy
settlement
of
our
difficulties
and
the
restoration
o
f
an
honorable
peace
that
paredes
should
not
retain
power
in
mexico
before
that
time
there
were
symptoms
of
a
revolution
in
mexico
favored
as
it
was
understood
to
be
by
the
more
liberal
party
and
especially
by
those
who
were
opposed
to
foreign
interference
and
to
the
monarchical
form
of
government
santa
anna
was
then
in
exile
in
havana
having
been
expelled
from
power
and
banished
from
his
country
by
a
revolution
which
occurred
in
december
but
it
was
known
that
he
had
still
a
considerable
party
in
his
favor
in
mexico
it
was
also
equally
well
known
that
no
vigilance
which
could
be
exerted
by
our
squadron
would
in
all
probability
have
prevented
him
from
effecting
a
landing
somewhere
on
the
extensive
gulf
coast
of
mexico
if
he
desired
to
return
to
his
country
he
had
openly
professed
an
entire
change
of
policy
had
expressed
his
regret
that
he
had
subverted
the
federal
constitution
of
and
avowed
that
he
was
now
in
favor
of
its
restoration
he
had
publicly
declared
his
hostility
in
strongest
terms
to
the
establishment
of
a
monarchy
and
to
european
interference
in
the
affairs
of
his
country
information
to
this
effect
had
been
received
from
sources
believed
to
be
reliable
at
the
date
of
the
recognition
of
the
existence
of
the
war
by
congress
and
was
afterwards
fully
confirmed
by
the
receipt
of
the
dispatch
of
our
consul
in
the
city
of
mexico
with
the
accompanying
documents
which
are
herewith
transmitted
besides
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
must
see
the
ruinous
consequences
to
mexico
of
a
war
with
the
united
states
and
that
it
would
be
his
interest
to
favor
peace
it
was
under
these
circumstances
and
upon
these
considerations
that
it
was
deemed
expedient
not
to
obstruct
his
return
to
mexico
should
he
attempt
to
do
so
our
object
was
the
restoration
of
peace
and
with
that
view
no
reason
was
perceived
why
we
should
take
part
with
paredes
and
aid
him
by
means
of
our
blockade
in
preventing
the
return
of
his
rival
to
mexico
on
the
contrary
it
was
believed
that
the
intestine
divisions
which
ordinary
sagacity
could
not
but
anticipate
as
the
fruit
of
santa
annas
return
to
mexico
and
his
contest
with
paredes
might
strongly
tend
to
produce
a
disposition
with
both
parties
to
restore
and
preserve
peace
with
the
united
states
paredes
was
a
soldier
by
profession
and
a
monarchist
in
principle
he
had
but
recently
before
been
successful
in
a
military
revolution
by
which
he
had
obtained
power
he
was
the
sworn
enemy
of
the
united
states
with
which
he
had
involved
his
country
in
the
existing
war
santa
anna
had
been
expelled
from
power
by
the
army
was
known
to
be
in
open
hostility
to
paredes
and
publicly
pledged
against
foreign
intervention
and
the
restoration
of
monarchy
in
mexico
in
view
of
these
facts
and
circumstances
it
was
that
when
orders
were
issued
to
the
commander
of
our
naval
forces
in
the
gulf
on
the
th
day
of
may
last
the
same
day
on
which
the
existence
of
the
war
was
recognized
by
congress
to
place
the
coasts
of
mexico
under
blockade
he
was
directed
not
to
obstruct
the
passage
of
santa
anna
to
mexico
should
he
attempt
to
return
a
revolution
took
place
in
mexico
in
the
early
part
of
august
following
by
which
the
power
of
paredes
was
overthrown
and
he
has
since
been
banished
from
the
country
and
is
now
in
exile
shortly
afterwards
santa
anna
returned
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
his
return
may
not
yet
prove
to
be
favorable
to
a
pacific
adjustment
of
the
existing
difficulties
it
being
manifestly
his
interest
not
to
persevere
in
the
prosecution
of
a
war
commenced
by
paredes
to
accomplish
a
purpose
so
absurd
as
the
reconquest
of
texas
to
the
sabine
had
paredes
remained
in
power
it
is
morally
certain
that
any
pacific
adjustment
would
have
been
hopeless
upon
the
commencement
of
hostilities
by
mexico
against
the
united
states
the
indignant
spirit
of
the
nation
was
at
once
aroused
congress
promptly
responded
to
the
expectations
of
the
country
and
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
may
last
recognized
the
fact
that
war
existed
by
the
act
of
mexico
between
the
united
states
and
that
republic
and
granted
the
means
necessary
for
its
vigorous
prosecution
being
involved
in
a
war
thus
commenced
by
mexico
and
for
the
justice
of
which
on
our
part
we
may
confidently
appeal
to
the
whole
world
i
resolved
to
prosecute
it
with
the
utmost
vigor
accordingly
the
ports
of
mexico
on
the
gulf
and
on
the
pacific
have
been
placed
under
blockade
and
her
territory
invaded
at
several
important
points
the
reports
from
the
departments
of
war
and
of
the
navy
will
inform
you
more
in
detail
of
the
measures
adopted
in
the
emergency
in
which
our
country
was
placed
and
of
the
gratifying
results
which
have
been
accomplished
the
various
columns
of
the
army
have
performed
their
duty
under
great
disadvantages
with
the
most
distinguished
skill
and
courage
the
victories
of
palo
alto
and
resaca
de
la
palma
and
of
monterey
won
against
greatly
superior
numbers
and
against
most
decided
advantages
in
other
respects
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
were
brilliant
in
their
execution
and
entitle
our
brave
officers
and
soldiers
to
the
grateful
thanks
of
their
country
the
nation
deplores
the
loss
of
the
brave
officers
and
men
who
have
gallantly
fallen
while
vindicating
and
defending
their
countrys
rights
and
honor
it
is
a
subject
of
pride
and
satisfaction
that
our
volunteer
citizen
soldiers
who
so
promptly
responded
to
their
countrys
call
with
an
experience
of
the
discipline
of
a
camp
of
only
a
few
weeks
have
borne
their
part
in
the
hardfought
battle
of
monterey
with
a
constancy
and
courage
equal
to
that
of
veteran
troops
and
worthy
of
the
highest
admiration
the
privations
of
long
marches
through
the
enemys
country
and
through
a
wilderness
have
been
borne
without
a
murmur
by
rapid
movements
the
province
of
new
mexico
with
santa
fe
its
capital
has
been
captured
without
bloodshed
the
navy
has
cooperated
with
the
army
and
rendered
important
services
if
not
so
brilliant
it
is
because
the
enemy
had
no
force
to
meet
them
on
their
own
element
and
because
of
the
defenses
which
nature
has
interposed
in
the
difficulties
of
the
navigation
on
the
mexican
coast
our
squadron
in
the
pacific
with
the
cooperation
of
a
gallant
officer
of
the
army
and
a
small
force
hastily
collected
in
that
distant
country
has
acquired
bloodless
possession
of
the
californias
and
the
american
flag
has
been
raised
at
every
important
point
in
that
province
i
congratulate
you
on
the
success
which
has
thus
attended
our
military
and
naval
operations
in
less
than
seven
months
after
mexico
commenced
hostilities
at
a
time
selected
by
herself
we
have
taken
possession
of
many
of
her
principal
ports
driven
back
and
pursued
her
invading
army
and
acquired
military
possession
of
the
mexican
provinces
of
new
mexico
new
leon
coahuila
tamaulipas
and
the
californias
a
territory
larger
in
extent
than
that
embraced
in
the
original
thirteen
states
of
the
union
inhabited
by
a
considerable
population
and
much
of
it
more
than
miles
from
the
points
at
which
we
had
to
collect
our
forces
and
commence
our
movements
by
the
blockade
the
import
and
export
trade
of
the
enemy
has
been
cut
off
well
may
the
american
people
be
proud
of
the
energy
and
gallantry
of
our
regular
and
volunteer
officers
and
soldiers
the
events
of
these
few
months
afford
a
gratifying
proof
that
our
country
can
under
any
emergency
confidently
rely
for
the
maintenance
of
her
honor
and
the
defense
of
her
rights
on
an
effective
force
ready
at
all
times
voluntarily
to
relinquish
the
comforts
of
home
for
the
perils
and
privations
of
the
camp
and
though
such
a
force
may
be
for
the
time
expensive
it
is
in
the
end
economical
as
the
ability
to
command
it
removes
the
necessity
of
employing
a
large
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
and
proves
that
our
people
love
their
institutions
and
are
ever
ready
to
defend
and
protect
them
while
the
war
was
in
a
course
of
vigorous
and
successful
prosecution
being
still
anxious
to
arrest
its
evils
and
considering
that
after
the
brilliant
victories
of
our
arms
on
the
th
and
th
of
may
last
the
national
honor
could
not
be
compromitted
by
it
another
overture
was
made
to
mexico
by
my
direction
on
the
th
of
july
last
to
terminate
hostilities
by
a
peace
just
and
honorable
to
both
countries
on
the
st
of
august
following
the
mexican
government
declined
to
accept
this
friendly
overture
but
referred
it
to
the
decision
of
a
mexican
congress
to
be
assembled
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
month
i
communicate
to
you
herewith
a
copy
of
the
letter
of
the
secretary
of
state
proposing
to
reopen
negotiations
of
the
answer
of
the
mexican
government
and
of
the
reply
thereto
of
the
secretary
of
state
the
war
will
continue
to
be
prosecuted
with
vigor
as
the
best
means
of
securing
peace
it
is
hoped
that
the
decision
of
the
mexican
congress
to
which
our
last
overture
has
been
referred
may
result
in
a
speedy
and
honorable
peace
with
our
experience
however
of
the
unreasonable
course
of
the
mexican
authorities
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
not
to
relax
in
the
energy
of
our
military
operations
until
the
result
is
made
known
in
this
view
it
is
deemed
important
to
hold
military
possession
of
all
the
provinces
which
have
been
taken
until
a
definitive
treaty
of
peace
shall
have
been
concluded
and
ratified
by
the
two
countries
the
war
has
not
been
waged
with
a
view
to
conquest
but
having
been
commenced
by
mexico
it
has
been
carried
into
the
enemys
country
and
will
be
vigorously
prosecuted
there
with
a
view
to
obtain
an
honorable
peace
and
thereby
secure
ample
indemnity
for
the
expenses
of
the
war
as
well
as
to
our
muchinjured
citizens
who
hold
large
pecuniary
demands
against
mexico
by
the
laws
of
nations
a
conquered
country
is
subject
to
be
governed
by
the
conqueror
during
his
military
possession
and
until
there
is
either
a
treaty
of
peace
or
he
shall
voluntarily
withdraw
from
it
the
old
civil
government
being
necessarily
superseded
it
is
the
right
and
duty
of
the
conqueror
to
secure
his
conquest
and
to
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
civil
order
and
the
rights
of
the
inhabitants
this
right
has
been
exercis
ed
and
this
duty
performed
by
our
military
and
naval
commanders
by
the
establishment
of
temporary
governments
in
some
of
the
conquered
provinces
of
mexico
assimilating
them
as
far
as
practicable
to
the
free
institutions
of
our
own
country
in
the
provinces
of
new
mexico
and
of
the
californias
little
if
any
further
resistance
is
apprehended
from
the
inhabitants
to
the
temporary
governments
which
have
thus
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
and
according
to
the
laws
of
war
been
established
it
may
be
proper
to
provide
for
the
security
of
these
important
conquests
by
making
an
adequate
appropriation
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
fortifications
and
defraying
the
expenses
necessarily
incident
to
the
maintenance
of
our
possession
and
authority
over
them
near
the
close
of
your
last
session
for
reasons
communicated
to
congress
i
deemed
it
important
as
a
measure
for
securing
a
speedy
peace
with
mexico
that
a
sum
of
money
should
be
appropriated
and
placed
in
the
power
of
the
executive
similar
to
that
which
had
been
made
upon
two
former
occasions
during
the
administration
of
president
jefferson
on
the
th
of
february
an
appropriation
of
was
made
and
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
president
its
object
is
well
known
it
was
at
that
time
in
contemplation
to
acquire
louisiana
from
france
and
it
was
intended
to
be
applied
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
which
might
be
paid
for
that
territory
on
the
th
of
february
the
same
sum
was
in
like
manner
appropriated
with
a
view
to
the
purchase
of
the
floridas
from
spain
these
appropriations
were
made
to
facilitate
negotiations
and
as
a
means
to
enable
the
president
to
accomplish
the
important
objects
in
view
though
it
did
not
become
necessary
for
the
president
to
use
these
appropriations
yet
a
state
of
things
might
have
arisen
in
which
it
would
have
been
highly
important
for
him
to
do
so
and
the
wisdom
of
making
them
can
not
be
doubted
it
is
believed
that
the
measure
recommended
at
your
last
session
met
with
the
approbation
of
decided
majorities
in
both
houses
of
congress
indeed
in
different
forms
a
bill
making
an
appropriation
of
passed
each
house
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
it
did
not
become
a
law
the
reasons
which
induced
me
to
recommend
the
measure
at
that
time
still
exist
and
i
again
submit
the
subject
for
your
consideration
and
suggest
the
importance
of
early
action
upon
it
should
the
appropriation
be
made
and
be
not
needed
it
will
remain
in
the
treasury
should
it
be
deemed
proper
to
apply
it
in
whole
or
in
part
it
will
be
accounted
for
as
other
public
expenditures
immediately
after
congress
had
recognized
the
existence
of
the
war
with
mexico
my
attention
was
directed
to
the
danger
that
privateers
might
be
fitted
out
in
the
ports
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
to
prey
upon
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
i
invited
the
special
attention
of
the
spanish
government
to
the
fourteenth
article
of
our
treaty
with
that
power
of
the
th
of
october
under
which
the
citizens
and
subjects
of
either
nation
who
shall
take
commissions
or
letters
of
marque
to
act
as
privateers
against
the
other
shall
be
punished
as
pirates
it
affords
me
pleasure
to
inform
you
that
i
have
received
assurances
from
the
spanish
government
that
this
article
of
the
treaty
shall
be
faithfully
observed
on
its
part
orders
for
this
purpose
were
immediately
transmitted
from
that
government
to
the
authorities
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
to
exert
their
utmost
vigilance
in
preventing
any
attempts
to
fit
out
privateers
in
those
islands
against
the
united
states
from
the
good
faith
of
spain
i
am
fully
satisfied
that
this
treaty
will
be
executed
in
its
spirit
as
well
as
its
letter
whilst
the
united
states
will
on
their
part
faithfully
perform
all
the
obligations
which
it
imposes
on
them
information
has
been
recently
received
at
the
department
of
state
that
the
mexican
government
has
sent
to
havana
blank
commissions
to
privateers
and
blank
certificates
of
naturalization
signed
by
general
salas
the
present
head
of
the
mexican
government
there
is
also
reason
to
apprehend
that
similar
documents
have
been
transmitted
to
other
parts
of
the
world
copies
of
these
papers
in
translation
are
herewith
transmitted
as
the
preliminaries
required
by
the
practice
of
civilized
nations
for
commissioning
privateers
and
regulating
their
conduct
appear
not
to
have
been
observed
and
as
these
commissions
are
in
blank
to
be
filled
up
with
the
names
of
citizens
and
subjects
of
all
nations
who
may
be
willing
to
purchase
them
the
whole
proceeding
can
only
be
construed
as
an
invitation
to
all
the
freebooters
upon
earth
who
are
willing
to
pay
for
the
privilege
to
cruise
against
american
commerce
it
will
be
for
our
courts
of
justice
to
decide
whether
under
such
circumstances
these
mexican
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
shall
protect
those
who
accept
them
and
commit
robberies
upon
the
high
seas
under
their
authority
from
the
pains
and
penalties
of
piracy
if
the
certificates
of
naturalization
thus
granted
be
intended
by
mexico
to
shield
spanish
subjects
from
the
guilt
and
punishment
of
pirates
under
our
treaty
with
spain
they
will
certainly
prove
unavailing
such
a
subterfuge
would
be
but
a
weak
device
to
defeat
the
provisions
of
a
solemn
treaty
i
recommend
that
congress
should
immediately
provide
by
law
for
the
trial
and
punishment
as
pirates
of
spanish
subjects
who
escaping
the
vigilance
of
their
government
shall
be
found
guilty
of
privateering
against
the
united
states
i
do
not
apprehend
serious
danger
from
these
privateers
our
navy
will
be
constantly
on
the
alert
to
protect
our
commerce
besides
in
case
prizes
should
be
made
of
american
vessels
the
utmost
vigilance
will
be
exerted
by
our
blockading
squadron
to
prevent
the
captors
from
taking
them
into
mexican
ports
and
it
is
not
apprehended
that
any
nation
will
violate
its
neutrality
by
suffering
such
prizes
to
be
condemned
and
sold
within
its
jurisdiction
i
recommend
that
congress
should
immediately
provide
by
law
for
granting
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
against
vessels
under
the
mexican
flag
it
is
true
that
there
are
but
few
if
any
commercial
vessels
of
mexico
upon
the
high
seas
and
it
is
therefore
not
probable
that
many
american
privateers
would
be
fitted
out
in
case
a
law
should
pass
authorizing
this
mode
of
warfare
it
is
notwithstanding
certain
that
such
privateers
may
render
good
service
to
the
commercial
interests
of
the
country
by
recapturing
our
merchant
ships
should
any
be
taken
by
armed
vessels
under
the
mexican
flag
as
well
as
by
capturing
these
vessels
themselves
every
means
within
our
power
should
be
rendered
available
for
the
protection
of
our
commerce
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
exhibit
a
detailed
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
finances
the
imports
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
were
of
the
value
of
of
which
the
amount
exported
was
leaving
the
amount
retained
in
the
country
for
domestic
consumption
the
value
of
the
exports
for
the
same
period
was
of
which
consisted
of
domestic
productions
and
of
foreign
articles
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
for
the
same
year
were
of
which
there
was
derived
from
customs
from
the
sales
of
public
lands
and
from
incidental
and
miscellaneous
sources
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
and
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
day
of
july
last
was
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
including
treasury
notes
on
the
st
of
the
present
month
was
of
which
the
sum
of
was
outstanding
on
the
th
of
march
leaving
the
amount
incurred
since
that
time
in
order
to
prosecute
the
war
with
mexico
with
vigor
and
energy
as
the
best
means
of
bringing
it
to
a
speedy
and
honorable
termination
a
further
loan
will
be
necessary
to
meet
the
expenditures
for
the
present
and
the
next
fiscal
year
if
the
war
should
be
continued
until
the
th
of
june
being
the
end
of
the
next
fiscal
year
it
is
estimated
that
an
additional
loan
of
will
be
required
this
estimate
is
made
upon
the
assumption
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
retain
constantly
in
the
treasury
to
guard
against
contingencies
if
such
surplus
were
not
required
to
be
retained
then
a
loan
of
would
be
sufficient
if
however
congress
should
at
the
present
session
impose
a
revenue
duty
on
the
principal
articles
now
embraced
in
the
free
list
it
is
estimated
that
an
additional
annual
revenue
of
about
two
millions
and
a
half
amounting
it
is
estimated
on
the
th
of
june
to
would
be
derived
from
that
source
and
the
loan
required
would
be
reduced
by
that
amount
it
is
estimated
also
that
should
congress
graduate
and
reduce
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
have
been
long
in
the
market
the
additional
revenue
derived
from
that
source
would
be
annually
for
several
years
to
come
between
half
a
million
and
a
million
dollars
and
the
loan
required
may
be
reduced
by
that
amount
also
should
these
measures
be
adopted
the
loan
required
would
not
probably
exceed
or
leaving
in
the
treasury
a
constant
surplus
of
the
loan
proposed
it
is
estimated
will
be
sufficient
to
cover
the
necessary
expenditures
both
for
the
war
and
for
all
other
purposes
up
to
the
th
of
june
and
an
amount
of
this
loan
not
exceeding
onehalf
may
be
required
during
the
present
fiscal
year
and
the
greater
part
of
the
remainder
during
the
first
half
of
the
fiscal
year
succeeding
in
order
that
timely
notice
may
be
given
and
proper
measures
taken
to
effect
the
loan
or
such
portion
of
it
as
may
be
required
it
is
important
that
the
authority
of
congress
to
make
it
be
given
at
an
early
period
of
your
present
session
it
is
suggested
that
the
loan
should
be
contracted
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
with
authority
to
purchase
the
stock
and
pay
it
off
at
an
earlier
period
at
its
market
value
out
of
any
surplus
which
may
at
any
time
be
in
the
treasury
applicable
to
that
purpose
after
the
establishment
of
peace
with
mexico
it
is
supposed
that
a
considerable
surplus
will
exist
and
that
the
debt
may
be
extinguished
in
a
much
shorter
period
than
that
for
which
it
may
be
contracted
the
period
of
twenty
years
as
that
for
which
the
proposed
loan
may
be
contracted
in
prefere
nce
to
a
shorter
period
is
suggested
because
all
experience
both
at
home
and
abroad
has
shown
that
loans
are
effected
upon
much
better
terms
upon
long
time
than
when
they
are
reimbursable
at
short
dates
necessary
as
this
measure
is
to
sustain
the
honor
and
the
interests
of
the
country
engaged
in
a
foreign
war
it
is
not
doubted
but
that
congress
will
promptly
authorize
it
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
july
last
exceeded
notwithstanding
considerable
expenditures
had
been
made
for
the
war
during
the
months
of
may
and
june
preceding
but
for
the
war
the
whole
public
debt
could
and
would
have
been
extinguished
within
a
short
period
and
it
was
a
part
of
my
settled
policy
to
do
so
and
thus
relieve
the
people
from
its
burden
and
place
the
government
in
a
position
which
would
enable
it
to
reduce
the
public
expenditures
to
that
economical
standard
which
is
most
consistent
with
the
general
welfare
and
the
pure
and
wholesome
progress
of
our
institutions
among
our
just
causes
of
complaint
against
mexico
arising
out
of
her
refusal
to
treat
for
peace
as
well
before
as
since
the
war
so
unjustly
commenced
on
her
part
are
the
extraordinary
expenditures
in
which
we
have
been
involved
justice
to
our
own
people
will
make
it
proper
that
mexico
should
be
held
responsible
for
these
expenditures
economy
in
the
public
expenditures
is
at
all
times
a
high
duty
which
all
public
functionaries
of
the
government
owe
to
the
people
this
duty
becomes
the
more
imperative
in
a
period
of
war
when
large
and
extraordinary
expenditures
become
unavoidable
during
the
existence
of
the
war
with
mexico
all
our
resources
should
be
husbanded
and
no
appropriations
made
except
such
as
are
absolutely
necessary
for
its
vigorous
prosecution
and
the
due
administration
of
the
government
objects
of
appropriation
which
in
peace
may
be
deemed
useful
or
proper
but
which
are
not
indispensable
for
the
public
service
may
when
the
country
is
engaged
in
a
foreign
war
be
well
postponed
to
a
future
period
by
the
observance
of
this
policy
at
your
present
session
large
amounts
may
be
saved
to
the
treasury
and
be
applied
to
objects
of
pressing
and
urgent
necessity
and
thus
the
creation
of
a
corresponding
amount
of
public
debt
may
be
avoided
it
is
not
meant
to
recommend
that
the
ordinary
and
necessary
appropriations
for
the
support
of
government
should
be
withheld
but
it
is
well
known
that
at
every
session
of
congress
appropriations
are
proposed
for
numerous
objects
which
may
or
may
not
be
made
without
materially
affecting
the
public
interests
and
these
it
is
recommended
should
not
be
granted
the
act
passed
at
your
last
session
reducing
the
duties
on
imports
not
having
gone
into
operation
until
the
st
of
the
present
month
there
has
not
been
time
for
its
practical
effect
upon
the
revenue
and
the
business
of
the
country
to
be
developed
it
is
not
doubted
however
that
the
just
policy
which
it
adopts
will
add
largely
to
our
foreign
trade
and
promote
the
general
prosperity
although
it
can
not
be
certainly
foreseen
what
amount
of
revenue
it
will
yield
it
is
estimated
that
it
will
exceed
that
produced
by
the
act
of
which
it
superseded
the
leading
principles
established
by
it
are
to
levy
the
taxes
with
a
view
to
raise
revenue
and
to
impose
them
upon
the
articles
imported
according
to
their
actual
value
the
act
of
by
the
excessive
rates
of
duty
which
it
imposed
on
many
articles
either
totally
excluded
them
from
importation
or
greatly
reduced
the
amount
imported
and
thus
diminished
instead
of
producing
revenue
by
it
the
taxes
were
imposed
not
for
the
legitimate
purpose
of
raising
revenue
but
to
afford
advantages
to
favored
classes
at
the
expense
of
a
large
majority
of
their
fellowcitizens
those
employed
in
agriculture
mechanical
pursuits
commerce
and
navigation
were
compelled
to
contribute
from
their
substance
to
swell
the
profits
and
overgrown
wealth
of
the
comparatively
few
who
had
invested
their
capital
in
manufactures
the
taxes
were
not
levied
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
the
articles
upon
which
they
were
imposed
but
widely
departing
from
this
just
rule
the
lighter
taxes
were
in
many
cases
levied
upon
articles
of
luxury
and
high
price
and
the
heavier
taxes
on
those
of
necessity
and
low
price
consumed
by
the
great
mass
of
the
people
it
was
a
system
the
inevitable
effect
of
which
was
to
relieve
favored
classes
and
the
wealthy
few
from
contributing
their
just
proportion
for
the
support
of
government
and
to
lay
the
burden
on
the
labor
of
the
many
engaged
in
other
pursuits
than
manufactures
a
system
so
unequal
and
unjust
has
been
superseded
by
the
existing
law
which
imposes
duties
not
for
the
benefit
or
injury
of
classes
or
pursuits
but
distributes
and
as
far
as
practicable
equalizes
the
public
burdens
among
all
classes
and
occupations
the
favored
classes
who
under
the
unequal
and
unjust
system
which
has
been
repealed
have
heretofore
realized
large
profits
and
many
of
them
amassed
large
fortunes
at
the
expense
of
the
many
who
have
been
made
tributary
to
them
will
have
no
reason
to
complain
if
they
shall
be
required
to
bear
their
just
proportion
of
the
taxes
necessary
for
the
support
of
government
so
far
from
it
it
will
be
perceived
by
an
examination
of
the
existing
law
that
discriminations
in
the
rates
of
duty
imposed
within
the
revenue
principle
have
been
retained
in
their
favor
the
incidental
aid
against
foreign
competition
which
they
still
enjoy
gives
them
an
advantage
which
no
other
pursuits
possess
but
of
this
none
others
will
complain
because
the
duties
levied
are
necessary
for
revenue
these
revenue
duties
including
freights
and
charges
which
the
importer
must
pay
before
he
can
come
in
competition
with
the
home
manufacturer
in
our
markets
amount
on
nearly
all
our
leading
branches
of
manufacture
to
more
than
onethird
of
the
value
of
the
imported
article
and
in
some
cases
to
almost
onehalf
its
value
with
such
advantages
it
is
not
doubted
that
our
domestic
manufacturers
will
continue
to
prosper
realizing
in
wellconducted
establishments
even
greater
profits
than
can
be
derived
from
any
other
regular
business
indeed
so
far
from
requiring
the
protection
of
even
incidental
revenue
duties
our
manufacturers
in
several
leading
branches
are
extending
their
business
giving
evidence
of
great
ingenuity
and
skill
and
of
their
ability
to
compete
with
increased
prospect
of
success
for
the
open
market
of
the
world
domestic
manufactures
to
the
value
of
several
millions
of
dollars
which
can
not
find
a
market
at
home
are
annually
exported
to
foreign
countries
with
such
rates
of
duty
as
those
established
by
the
existing
law
the
system
will
probably
be
permanent
and
capitalists
who
are
made
or
shall
hereafter
make
their
investments
in
manufactures
will
know
upon
what
to
rely
the
country
will
be
satisfied
with
these
rates
because
the
advantages
which
the
manufacturers
still
enjoy
result
necessarily
from
the
collection
of
revenue
for
the
support
of
government
high
protective
duties
from
their
unjust
operation
upon
the
masses
of
the
people
can
not
fail
to
give
rise
to
extensive
dissatisfaction
and
complaint
and
to
constant
efforts
to
change
or
repeal
them
rendering
all
investments
in
manufactures
uncertain
and
precarious
lower
and
more
permanent
rates
of
duty
at
the
same
time
that
they
will
yield
to
the
manufacturer
fair
and
remunerating
profits
will
secure
him
against
the
danger
of
frequent
changes
in
the
system
which
can
not
fail
to
ruinously
affect
his
interests
simultaneously
with
the
relaxation
of
the
restrictive
policy
by
the
united
states
great
britain
from
whose
example
we
derived
the
system
has
relaxed
hers
she
has
modified
her
corn
laws
and
reduced
many
other
duties
to
moderate
revenue
rates
after
ages
of
experience
the
statesmen
of
that
country
have
been
constrained
by
a
stern
necessity
and
by
a
public
opinion
having
its
deep
foundation
in
the
sufferings
and
wants
of
impoverished
millions
to
abandon
a
system
the
effect
of
which
was
to
build
up
immense
fortunes
in
the
hands
of
the
few
and
to
reduce
the
laboring
millions
to
pauperism
and
misery
nearly
in
the
same
ratio
that
labor
was
depressed
capital
was
increased
and
concentrated
by
the
british
protective
policy
the
evils
of
the
system
in
great
britain
were
at
length
rendered
intolerable
and
it
has
been
abandoned
but
not
without
a
severe
struggle
on
the
part
of
the
protected
and
favored
classes
to
retain
the
unjust
advantages
which
they
have
so
long
enjoyed
it
was
to
be
expected
that
a
similar
struggle
would
be
made
by
the
same
classes
in
the
united
states
whenever
an
attempt
was
made
to
modify
or
abolish
the
same
unjust
system
here
the
protective
policy
had
been
in
operation
in
the
united
states
for
a
much
shorter
period
and
its
pernicious
effects
were
not
therefore
so
clearly
perceived
and
felt
enough
however
was
known
of
these
effects
to
induce
its
repeal
it
would
be
strange
if
in
the
face
of
the
example
of
great
britain
our
principal
foreign
customer
and
of
the
evils
of
a
system
rendered
manifest
in
that
country
by
long
and
painful
experience
and
in
the
face
of
the
immense
advantages
which
under
a
more
liberal
commercial
policy
we
are
already
deriving
and
must
continue
to
derive
by
supplying
her
starving
population
with
food
the
united
states
should
restore
a
policy
which
she
has
been
compelled
to
abandon
and
thus
diminish
her
ability
to
purchase
from
us
the
food
and
other
articles
which
she
so
much
needs
and
we
so
much
desire
to
sell
by
the
simultaneous
abandonment
of
the
protective
policy
by
great
britain
and
the
united
states
new
and
important
markets
have
already
been
opened
for
our
agricultural
and
other
products
commerce
and
navigation
have
received
a
new
impulse
labor
and
trade
have
been
released
from
the
artificial
trammels
which
have
so
long
fettered
them
and
to
a
great
extent
reciprocity
in
the
exchange
of
commodities
has
been
introduced
at
the
same
time
by
both
countries
and
greatly
for
the
benefit
of
both
great
britain
has
been
forced
by
the
pressure
of
circumstances
at
home
to
abandon
a
policy
which
has
been
upheld
for
age
s
and
to
open
her
markets
for
our
immense
surplus
of
breadstuffs
and
it
is
confidently
believed
that
other
powers
of
europe
will
ultimately
see
the
wisdom
if
they
be
not
compelled
by
the
pauperism
and
sufferings
of
their
crowded
population
to
pursue
a
similar
policy
our
farmers
are
more
deeply
interested
in
maintaining
the
just
and
liberal
policy
of
the
existing
law
than
any
other
class
of
our
citizens
they
constitute
a
large
majority
of
our
population
and
it
is
well
known
that
when
they
prosper
all
other
pursuits
prosper
also
they
have
heretofore
not
only
received
none
of
the
bounties
or
favors
of
government
but
by
the
unequal
operations
of
the
protective
policy
have
been
made
by
the
burdens
of
taxation
which
it
imposed
to
contribute
to
the
bounties
which
have
enriched
others
when
a
foreign
as
well
as
a
home
market
is
opened
to
them
they
must
receive
as
they
are
now
receiving
increased
prices
for
their
products
they
will
find
a
readier
sale
and
at
better
prices
for
their
wheat
flour
rice
indian
corn
beef
pork
lard
butter
cheese
and
other
articles
which
they
produce
the
home
market
alone
is
inadequate
to
enable
them
to
dispose
of
the
immense
surplus
of
food
and
other
articles
which
they
are
capable
of
producing
even
at
the
most
reduced
prices
for
the
manifest
reason
that
they
can
not
be
consumed
in
the
country
the
united
states
can
from
their
immense
surplus
supply
not
only
the
home
demand
but
the
deficiencies
of
food
required
by
the
whole
world
that
the
reduced
production
of
some
of
the
chief
articles
of
food
in
great
britain
and
other
parts
of
europe
may
have
contributed
to
increase
the
demand
for
our
breadstuffs
and
provisions
is
not
doubted
but
that
the
great
and
efficient
cause
of
this
increased
demand
and
of
increased
prices
consists
in
the
removal
of
artificial
restrictions
heretofore
imposed
is
deemed
to
be
equally
certain
that
our
exports
of
food
already
increased
and
increasing
beyond
former
example
under
the
more
liberal
policy
which
has
been
adopted
will
be
still
vastly
enlarged
unless
they
be
checked
or
prevented
by
a
restoration
of
the
protective
policy
can
not
be
doubted
that
our
commercial
and
navigating
interests
will
be
enlarged
in
a
corresponding
ratio
with
the
increase
of
our
trade
is
equally
certain
while
our
manufacturing
interests
will
still
be
the
favored
interests
of
the
country
and
receive
the
incidental
protection
afforded
them
by
revenue
duties
and
more
than
this
they
can
not
justly
demand
in
my
annual
message
of
december
last
a
tariff
of
revenue
duties
based
upon
the
principles
of
the
existing
law
was
recommended
and
i
have
seen
no
reason
to
change
the
opinions
then
expressed
in
view
of
the
probable
beneficial
effects
of
that
law
i
recommend
that
the
policy
established
by
it
be
maintained
it
has
but
just
commenced
to
operate
and
to
abandon
or
modify
it
without
giving
it
a
fair
trial
would
be
inexpedient
and
unwise
should
defects
in
any
of
its
details
be
ascertained
by
actual
experience
to
exist
these
may
be
hereafter
corrected
but
until
such
defects
shall
become
manifest
the
act
should
be
fairly
tested
it
is
submitted
for
your
consideration
whether
it
may
not
be
proper
as
a
war
measure
to
impose
revenue
duties
on
some
of
the
articles
now
embraced
in
the
free
list
should
it
be
deemed
proper
to
impose
such
duties
with
a
view
to
raise
revenue
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
war
with
mexico
or
to
avoid
to
that
extent
the
creation
of
a
public
debt
they
may
be
repealed
when
the
emergency
which
gave
rise
to
them
shall
cease
to
exist
and
constitute
no
part
of
the
permanent
policy
of
the
country
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
last
to
provide
for
the
better
organization
of
the
treasury
and
for
the
collection
safekeeping
transfer
and
disbursement
of
the
public
revenue
has
been
carried
into
execution
as
rapidly
as
the
delay
necessarily
arising
out
of
the
appointment
of
new
officers
taking
and
approving
their
bonds
and
preparing
and
securing
proper
places
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
money
would
permit
it
is
not
proposed
to
depart
in
any
respect
from
the
principles
or
policy
on
which
this
great
measure
is
rounded
there
are
however
defects
in
the
details
of
the
measure
developed
by
its
practical
operation
which
are
fully
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
which
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
these
defects
would
impair
to
some
extent
the
successful
operation
of
the
law
at
all
times
but
are
especially
embarrassing
when
the
country
is
engaged
in
a
war
when
the
expenditures
are
greatly
increased
when
loans
are
to
be
effected
and
the
disbursements
are
to
be
made
at
points
many
hundred
miles
distant
in
some
cases
from
any
depository
and
a
large
portion
of
them
in
a
foreign
country
the
modifications
suggested
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
are
recommended
to
your
favorable
consideration
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
importance
of
establishing
a
branch
of
the
mint
of
the
united
states
at
new
york
twothirds
of
the
revenue
derived
from
customs
being
collected
at
that
point
the
demand
for
specie
to
pay
the
duties
will
be
large
and
a
branch
mint
where
foreign
coin
and
bullion
could
be
immediately
converted
into
american
coin
would
greatly
facilitate
the
transaction
of
the
public
business
enlarge
the
circulation
of
gold
and
silver
and
be
at
the
same
time
a
safe
depository
of
the
public
money
the
importance
of
graduating
and
reducing
the
price
of
such
of
the
public
lands
as
have
been
long
offered
in
the
market
at
the
minimum
rate
authorized
by
existing
laws
and
remain
unsold
induces
me
again
to
recommend
the
subject
to
your
favorable
consideration
many
millions
of
acres
of
these
lands
have
been
offered
in
the
market
for
more
than
thirty
years
and
larger
quantities
for
more
than
ten
or
twenty
years
and
being
of
an
inferior
quality
they
must
remain
unsalable
for
an
indefinite
period
unless
the
price
at
which
they
may
be
purchased
shall
be
reduced
to
place
a
price
upon
them
above
their
real
value
is
not
only
to
prevent
their
sale
and
thereby
deprive
the
treasury
of
any
income
from
that
source
but
is
unjust
to
the
states
in
which
they
lie
because
it
retards
their
growth
and
increase
of
population
and
because
they
have
no
power
to
levy
a
tax
upon
them
as
upon
other
lands
within
their
limits
held
by
other
proprietors
than
the
united
states
for
the
support
of
their
local
governments
the
beneficial
effects
of
the
graduation
principle
have
been
realized
by
some
of
the
states
owning
the
lands
within
their
limits
in
which
it
has
been
adopted
they
have
been
demonstrated
also
by
the
united
states
acting
as
the
trustee
of
the
chickasaw
tribe
of
indians
in
the
sale
of
their
lands
lying
within
the
states
of
mississippi
and
alabama
the
chickasaw
lands
which
would
not
command
in
the
market
the
minimum
price
established
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
for
the
sale
of
their
lands
were
in
pursuance
of
the
treaty
of
with
that
tribe
subsequently
offered
for
sale
at
graduated
and
reduced
rates
for
limited
periods
the
result
was
that
large
quantities
of
these
lands
were
purchased
which
would
otherwise
have
remained
unsold
the
lands
were
disposed
of
at
their
real
value
and
many
persons
of
limited
means
were
enabled
to
purchase
small
tracts
upon
which
they
have
settled
with
their
families
that
similar
results
would
be
produced
by
the
adoption
of
the
graduation
policy
by
the
united
states
in
all
the
states
in
which
they
are
the
owners
of
large
bodies
of
lands
which
have
been
long
in
the
market
can
not
be
doubted
it
can
not
be
a
sound
policy
to
withhold
large
quantities
of
the
public
lands
from
the
use
and
occupation
of
our
citizens
by
fixing
upon
them
prices
which
experience
has
shown
they
will
not
command
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
wise
policy
to
afford
facilities
to
our
citizens
to
become
the
owners
at
low
and
moderate
rates
of
freeholds
of
their
own
instead
of
being
the
tenants
and
dependents
of
others
if
it
be
apprehended
that
these
lands
if
reduced
in
price
would
be
secured
in
large
quantities
by
speculators
or
capitalists
the
sales
may
be
restricted
in
limited
quantities
to
actual
settlers
or
persons
purchasing
for
purposes
of
cultivation
in
my
last
annual
message
i
submitted
for
the
consideration
of
congress
the
present
system
of
managing
the
mineral
lands
of
the
united
states
and
recommended
that
they
should
be
brought
into
market
and
sold
upon
such
terms
and
under
such
restrictions
as
congress
might
prescribe
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
july
last
the
reserved
lead
mines
and
contiguous
lands
in
the
states
of
illinois
and
arkansas
and
territories
of
wisconsin
and
iowa
were
authorized
to
be
sold
the
act
is
confined
in
its
operation
to
lead
mines
and
contiguous
lands
a
large
portion
of
the
public
lands
containing
copper
and
other
ores
is
represented
to
be
very
valuable
and
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
authorizing
the
sale
of
these
lands
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
from
their
supposed
value
may
in
the
judgment
of
congress
be
deemed
advisable
having
due
regard
to
the
interests
of
such
of
our
citizens
as
may
be
located
upon
them
it
will
be
important
during
your
present
session
to
establish
a
territorial
government
and
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
and
laws
of
the
united
states
over
the
territory
of
oregon
our
laws
regulating
trade
and
intercourse
with
the
indian
tribes
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
should
be
extended
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
for
the
purpose
of
executing
them
and
preserving
friendly
relations
with
the
indian
tribes
within
our
limits
an
additional
number
of
indian
agencies
will
be
required
and
should
be
authorized
by
law
the
establishment
of
customhouses
and
of
postoffices
and
postroads
and
provision
for
the
transportation
of
the
mail
on
such
routes
as
the
public
convenience
will
suggest
require
legislative
authority
it
will
be
proper
also
to
establish
a
surveyorgenerals
office
in
that
territory
and
to
make
the
necessary
provision
for
surveying
the
public
lands
and
bringing
them
into
market
as
our
citizens
who
now
reside
in
that
distant
reg
ion
have
been
subjected
to
many
hardships
privations
and
sacrifices
in
their
emigration
and
by
their
improvements
have
enhanced
the
value
of
the
public
lands
in
the
neighborhood
of
their
settlements
it
is
recommended
that
liberal
grants
be
made
to
them
of
such
portions
of
these
lands
as
they
may
occupy
and
that
similar
grants
or
rights
of
preemption
be
made
to
all
who
may
emigrate
thither
within
a
limited
period
prescribed
by
law
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
contains
detailed
information
relative
to
the
several
branches
of
the
public
service
connected
with
that
department
the
operations
of
the
army
have
been
of
a
satisfactory
and
highly
gratifying
character
i
recommend
to
your
early
and
favorable
consideration
the
measures
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
war
for
speedily
filling
up
the
rank
and
file
of
the
regular
army
for
its
greater
efficiency
in
the
field
and
for
raising
an
additional
force
to
serve
during
the
war
with
mexico
embarrassment
is
likely
to
arise
for
want
of
legal
provision
authorizing
compensation
to
be
made
to
the
agents
employed
in
the
several
states
and
territories
to
pay
the
revolutionary
and
other
pensioners
the
amounts
allowed
them
by
law
your
attention
is
invited
to
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
war
on
this
subject
these
agents
incur
heavy
responsibilities
and
perform
important
duties
and
no
reason
exists
why
they
should
not
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
as
to
compensation
with
other
disbursing
officers
our
relations
with
the
various
indian
tribes
continue
to
be
of
a
pacific
character
the
unhappy
dissensions
which
have
existed
among
the
cherokees
for
many
years
past
have
been
healed
since
my
last
annual
message
important
treaties
have
been
negotiated
with
some
of
the
tribes
by
which
the
indian
title
to
large
tracts
of
valuable
land
within
the
limits
of
the
states
and
territories
has
been
extinguished
and
arrangements
made
for
removing
them
to
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
between
and
of
different
tribes
have
been
removed
to
the
country
provided
for
them
by
treaty
stipulations
and
arrangements
have
been
made
for
others
to
follow
in
our
intercourse
with
the
several
tribes
particular
attention
has
been
given
to
the
important
subject
of
education
the
number
of
schools
established
among
them
has
been
increased
and
additional
means
provided
not
only
for
teaching
them
the
rudiments
of
education
but
of
instructing
them
in
agriculture
and
the
mechanic
arts
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
a
satisfactory
view
of
the
operations
of
the
department
under
his
charge
during
the
past
year
it
is
gratifying
to
perceive
that
while
the
war
with
mexico
has
rendered
it
necessary
to
employ
an
unusual
number
of
our
armed
vessels
on
her
coasts
the
protection
due
to
our
commerce
in
other
quarters
of
the
world
has
not
proved
insufficient
no
means
will
be
spared
to
give
efficiency
to
the
naval
service
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
and
i
am
happy
to
know
that
the
officers
and
men
anxiously
desire
to
devote
themselves
to
the
service
of
their
country
in
any
enterprise
however
difficult
of
execution
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
proposition
to
add
to
each
of
our
foreign
squadrons
an
efficient
sea
steamer
and
as
especially
demanding
attention
the
establishment
at
pensacola
of
the
necessary
means
of
repairing
and
refitting
the
vessels
of
the
navy
employed
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
there
are
other
suggestions
in
the
report
which
deserve
and
i
doubt
not
will
receive
your
consideration
the
progress
and
condition
of
the
mail
service
for
the
past
year
are
fully
presented
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
the
revenue
for
the
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
amounted
to
which
is
less
than
that
of
the
preceding
year
the
payments
for
that
department
during
the
same
time
amounted
to
of
this
sum
have
been
drawn
from
the
treasury
the
disbursements
for
the
year
were
less
than
those
of
the
preceding
year
while
the
disbursements
have
been
thus
diminished
the
mail
facilities
have
been
enlarged
by
new
mail
routes
of
miles
an
increase
of
transportation
of
miles
and
the
establishment
of
new
postoffices
contractors
postmasters
and
others
engaged
in
this
branch
of
the
service
have
performed
their
duties
with
energy
and
faithfulness
deserving
commendation
for
many
interesting
details
connected
with
the
operations
of
this
establishment
you
are
referred
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
and
his
suggestions
for
improving
its
revenues
are
recommended
to
your
favorable
consideration
i
repeat
the
opinion
expressed
in
my
last
annual
message
that
the
business
of
this
department
should
be
so
regulated
that
the
revenues
derived
from
it
should
be
made
to
equal
the
expenditures
and
it
is
believed
that
this
may
be
done
by
proper
modifications
of
the
present
laws
as
suggested
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
without
changing
the

is
to
me
a
source
of
unaffected
satisfaction
to
meet
the
representatives
of
the
states
and
the
people
in
congress
assembled
as
it
will
be
to
receive
the
aid
of
their
combined

performing
for

by

constitution
of
giving
to
you
information
of
the
state
of

and
recommending
to
your
consideration
such
measures
as
in
my
judgment
are
necessary
and
expedient
i
am
happy
that
i
can
congratulate
you
on
the
continued
prosperity
of
our
country
under
the
blessings
of
divine
providence
and
the
benign
influence
of
our
free
institutions
it
stands
before
the
world
a
spectacle
of
national
happiness
with
our
unexampled
advancement
in
all
the
elements
of
national
greatness
the
affection
of
the
people
is
confirmed
for
the
union
of
the
states
and
for
the
doctrines
of
popular
liberty
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
our
government
it
becomes
us
in
humility
to
make
our
devout
acknowledgments
to
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
for
the
inestimable
civil
and
religious
blessings
with
which
we
are
favored
in
calling
the
attention
of
congress
to
our
relations
with
foreign
powers
i
am
gratified
to
be
able
to
state
that
though
with
some
of
them
there
have
existed
since
your
last
session
serious
causes
of
irritation
and
misunderstanding
yet
no
actual
hostilities
have
taken
place
adopting
the
maxim
in
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
affairs
to
ask
nothing
that
is
not
right
and
submit
to
nothing
that
is
wrong
it
has
been
my
anxious
desire
to
preserve
peace
with
all
nations
but
at
the
same
time
to
be
prepared
to
resist
aggression
and
maintain
all
our
just
rights
in
pursuance
of
the
joint
resolution
of
congress
for
annexing
texas
to
the
united
states
my
predecessor
on
the
d
day
of
march
elected
to
submit
the
first
and
second
sections
of
that
resolution
to
the
republic
of
texas
as
an
overture
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
for
her
admission
as
a
state
into
our
union
this
election
i
approved
and
accordingly
the
charge
daffaires
of
the
united
states
in
texas
under
instructions
of
the
th
of
march
presented
these
sections
of
the
resolution
for
the
acceptance
of
that
republic
the
executive
government
the
congress
and
the
people
of
texas
in
convention
have
successively
complied
with
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
joint
resolution
a
constitution
for
the
government
of
the
state
of
texas
formed
by
a
convention
of
deputies
is
herewith
laid
before
congress
it
is
well
known
also
that
the
people
of
texas
at
the
polls
have
accepted
the
terms
of
annexation
and
ratified
the
constitution
i
communicate
to
congress
the
correspondence
between
the
secretary
of
state
and
our
charge
daffaires
in
texas
and
also
the
correspondence
of
the
latter
with
the
authorities
of
texas
together
with
the
official
documents
transmitted
by
him
to
his
own
government
the
terms
of
annexation
which
were
offered
by
the
united
states
having
been
accepted
by
texas
the
public
faith
of
both
parties
is
solemnly
pledged
to
the
compact
of
their
union
nothing
remains
to
consummate
the
event
but
the
passage
of
an
act
by
congress
to
admit
the
state
of
texas
into
the
union
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
strong
reasons
exist
why
this
should
be
done
at
an
early
period
of
the
session
it
will
be
observed
that
by
the
constitution
of
texas
the
existing
government
is
only
continued
temporarily
till
congress
can
act
and
that
the
third
monday
of
the
present
month
is
the
day
appointed
for
holding
the
first
general
election
on
that
day
a
governor
a
lieutenantgovernor
and
both
branches
of
the
legislature
will
be
chosen
by
the
people
the
president
of
texas
is
required
immediately
after
the
receipt
of
official
information
that
the
new
state
has
been
admitted
into
our
union
by
congress
to
convene
the
legislature
and
upon
its
meeting
the
existing
government
will
be
superseded
and
the
state
government
organized
questions
deeply
interesting
to
texas
in
common
with
the
other
states
the
extension
of
our
revenue
laws
and
judicial
system
over
her
people
and
territory
as
well
as
measures
of
a
local
character
will
claim
the
early
attention
of
congress
and
therefore
upon
every
principle
of
republican
government
she
ought
to
be
represented
in
that
body
without
unnecessary
delay
i
can
not
too
earnestly
recommend
prompt
action
on
this
important
subject
as
soon
as
the
act
to
admit
texas
as
a
state
shall
be
passed
the
union
of
the
two
republics
will
be
consummated
by
their
own
voluntary
consent
this
accession
to
our
territory
has
been
a
bloodless
achievement
no
arm
of
force
has
been
raised
to
produce
the
result
the
sword
has
had
no
part
in
the
victory
we
have
not
sought
to
extend
our
territorial
possessions
by
conquest
or
our
republican
institutions
over
a
reluctant
people
it
was
the
deliberate
homage
of
each
people
to
the
great
principle
of
our
federative
union
if
we
consider
the
extent
of
territory
involved
in
the
annexation
its
prospective
influence
on
america
the
means
by
which
it
has
been
accomplished
springing
purely
from
the
choice
of
the
people
themselves
to
share
the
blessings
of
our
union
the
history
of
the
world
may
be
challenged
to
furnish
a
parallel
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
which
at
the
formation
of
the
federal
constitution
was
bounded
by
the
st
marys
on
the
atlantic
has
passed
the
capes
of
florida
and
been
peacefully
extended
to
the
del
norte
in
contemplating
the
grandeur
of
this
event
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
the
result
was
achieved
in
despite
of
the
diplomatic
interference
of
european
monarchies
even
france
the
country
which
had
been
our
ancient
ally
the
country
which
has
a
common
interest
with
us
in
maintaining
the
freedom
of
the
seas
the
country
which
by
the
cession
of
louisiana
first
opened
to
us
access
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
country
with
which
we
have
been
every
year
drawing
more
and
more
closely
the
bonds
of
successful
commerce
most
unexpectedly
and
to
our
unfeigned
regret
took
part
in
an
effort
to
prevent
annexation
and
to
impose
on
texas
as
a
condition
of
the
recognition
of
her
independence
by
mexico
that
she
would
never
join
herself
to
the
united
states
we
may
rejoice
that
the
tranquil
and
pervading
influence
of
the
american
principle
of
selfgovernment
was
sufficient
to
defeat
the
purposes
of
british
and
french
interference
and
that
the
almost
unanimous
voice
of
the
people
of
texas
has
given
to
that
interference
a
peaceful
and
effective
rebuke
from
this
example
european
governments
may
learn
how
vain
diplomatic
arts
and
intrigues
must
ever
prove
upon
this
continent
against
that
system
of
selfgovernment
which
seems
natural
to
our
soil
and
which
will
ever
resist
foreign
interference
toward
texas
i
do
not
doubt
that
a
liberal
and
generous
spirit
will
actuate
congress
in
all
that
concerns
her
interests
and
prosperity
and
that
she
will
never
have
cause
to
regret
that
she
has
united
her
lone
star
to
our
glorious
constellation
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
our
relations
with
mexico
since
your
last
session
have
not
been
of
the
amicable
character
which
it
is
our
desire
to
cultivate
with
all
foreign
nations
on
the
th
day
of
march
last
the
mexican
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
the
united
states
made
a
formal
protest
in
the
name
of
his
government
against
the
joint
resolution
passed
by
congress
for
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
which
he
chose
to
regard
as
a
violation
of
the
rights
of
mexico
and
in
consequence
of
it
he
demanded
his
passports
he
was
informed
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
did
not
consider
this
joint
resolution
as
a
violation
of
any
of
the
rights
of
mexico
or
that
it
afforded
any
just
cause
of
offense
to
his
government
that
the
republic
of
texas
was
an
independent
power
owing
no
allegiance
to
mexico
and
constituting
no
part
of
her
territory
or
rightful
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
he
was
also
assured
that
it
was
the
sincere
desire
of
this
government
to
maintain
with
that
of
mexico
relations
of
peace
and
good
understanding
that
functionary
however
notwithstanding
these
representations
and
assurances
abruptly
terminated
his
mission
and
shortly
afterwards
left
the
country
our
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
mexico
was
refused
all
official
intercourse
with
that
government
and
after
remaining
several
months
by
the
permission
of
his
own
government
he
returned
to
the
united
states
thus
by
the
acts
of
mexico
all
diplomatic
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
was
suspended
since
that
time
mexico
has
until
recently
occupied
an
attitude
of
hostility
toward
the
united
stateshas
been
marshaling
and
organizing
armies
issuing
proclamations
and
avowing
the
intention
to
make
war
on
the
united
states
either
by
an
open
declaration
or
by
invading
texas
both
the
congress
and
convention
of
the
people
of
texas
invited
this
government
to
send
an
army
into
that
territory
to
protect
and
defend
them
against
the
menaced
attack
the
moment
the
terms
of
annexation
offered
by
the
united
states
were
accepted
by
texas
the
latter
became
so
far
a
part
of
our
own
country
as
to
make
it
our
duty
to
afford
such
protection
and
defense
i
therefore
deemed
it
proper
as
a
precautionary
measure
to
order
a
strong
squadron
to
the
coasts
of
mexico
and
to
concentrate
an
efficient
military
force
on
the
western
frontier
of
texas
our
army
was
ordered
to
take
position
in
the
country
between
the
nueces
and
the
del
norte
and
to
repel
any
invasion
of
the
texan
territory
which
might
be
attempted
by
the
mexican
forces
our
squadron
in
the
gulf
was
ordered
to
cooperate
with
the
army
but
though
our
army
and
navy
were
placed
in
a
position
to
defend
our
own
and
the
rights
of
texas
they
were
ordered
to
commit
no
act
of
hostility
against
mexico
unless
she
declared
war
or
was
herself
the
aggressor
by
striking
the
first
blow
the
result
has
been
that
mexico
has
made
no
aggressive
movement
and
our
military
and
naval
commanders
have
executed
their
orders
with
such
discretion
that
the
peace
of
the
two
republ
ics
has
not
been
disturbed
texas
had
declared
her
independence
and
maintained
it
by
her
arms
for
more
than
nine
years
she
has
had
an
organized
government
in
successful
operation
during
that
period
her
separate
existence
as
an
independent
state
had
been
recognized
by
the
united
states
and
the
principal
powers
of
europe
treaties
of
commerce
and
navigation
had
been
concluded
with
her
by
different
nations
and
it
had
become
manifest
to
the
whole
world
that
any
further
attempt
on
the
part
of
mexico
to
conquer
her
or
overthrow
her
government
would
be
vain
even
mexico
herself
had
become
satisfied
of
this
fact
and
whilst
the
question
of
annexation
was
pending
before
the
people
of
texas
during
the
past
summer
the
government
of
mexico
by
a
formal
act
agreed
to
recognize
the
independence
of
texas
on
condition
that
she
would
not
annex
herself
to
any
other
power
the
agreement
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
texas
whether
with
or
without
this
condition
is
conclusive
against
mexico
the
independence
of
texas
is
a
fact
conceded
by
mexico
herself
and
she
had
no
right
or
authority
to
prescribe
restrictions
as
to
the
form
of
government
which
texas
might
afterwards
choose
to
assume
but
though
mexico
can
not
complain
of
the
united
states
on
account
of
the
annexation
of
texas
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
serious
causes
of
misunderstanding
between
the
two
countries
continue
to
exist
growing
out
of
unredressed
injuries
inflicted
by
the
mexican
authorities
and
people
on
the
persons
and
property
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
through
a
long
series
of
years
mexico
has
admitted
these
injuries
but
has
neglected
and
refused
to
repair
them
such
was
the
character
of
the
wrongs
and
such
the
insults
repeatedly
offered
to
american
citizens
and
the
american
flag
by
mexico
in
palpable
violation
of
the
laws
of
nations
and
the
treaty
between
the
two
countries
of
the
th
of
april
that
they
have
been
repeatedly
brought
to
the
notice
of
congress
by
my
predecessors
as
early
as
the
th
of
february
the
president
of
the
united
states
declared
in
a
message
to
congress
that
the
length
of
time
since
some
of
the
injuries
have
been
committed
the
repeated
and
unavailing
applications
for
redress
the
wanton
character
of
some
of
the
outrages
upon
the
property
and
persons
of
our
citizens
upon
the
officers
and
flag
of
the
united
states
independent
of
recent
insults
to
this
government
and
people
by
the
late
extraordinary
mexican
minister
would
justify
in
the
eyes
of
all
nations
immediate
war
he
did
not
however
recommend
an
immediate
resort
to
this
extreme
measure
which
he
declared
should
not
be
used
by
just
and
generous
nations
confiding
in
their
strength
for
injuries
committed
if
it
can
be
honorably
avoided
but
in
a
spirit
of
forbearance
proposed
that
another
demand
be
made
on
mexico
for
that
redress
which
had
been
so
long
and
unjustly
withheld
in
these
views
committees
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
in
reports
made
to
their
respective
bodies
concurred
since
these
proceedings
more
than
eight
years
have
elapsed
during
which
in
addition
to
the
wrongs
then
complained
of
others
of
an
aggravated
character
have
been
committed
on
the
persons
and
property
of
our
citizens
a
special
agent
was
sent
to
mexico
in
the
summer
of
with
full
authority
to
make
another
and
final
demand
for
redress
the
demand
was
made
the
mexican
government
promised
to
repair
the
wrongs
of
which
we
complained
and
after
much
delay
a
treaty
of
indemnity
with
that
view
was
concluded
between
the
two
powers
on
the
th
of
april
and
was
duly
ratified
by
both
governments
by
this
treaty
a
joint
commission
was
created
to
adjudicate
and
decide
on
the
claims
of
american
citizens
on
the
government
of
mexico
the
commission
was
organized
at
washington
on
the
th
day
of
august
their
time
was
limited
to
eighteen
months
at
the
expiration
of
which
they
had
adjudicated
and
decided
claims
amounting
to
in
favor
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
the
mexican
government
leaving
a
large
amount
of
claims
undecided
of
the
latter
the
american
commissioners
had
decided
in
favor
of
our
citizens
claims
amounting
to
which
were
left
unacted
on
by
the
umpire
authorized
by
the
treaty
still
further
claims
amounting
to
between
three
and
four
millions
of
dollars
were
submitted
to
the
board
too
late
to
be
considered
and
were
left
undisposed
of
the
sum
of
decided
by
the
board
was
a
liquidated
and
ascertained
debt
due
by
mexico
to
the
claimants
and
there
was
no
justifiable
reason
for
delaying
its
payment
according
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
it
was
not
however
paid
mexico
applied
for
further
indulgence
and
in
that
spirit
of
liberality
and
forbearance
which
has
ever
marked
the
policy
of
the
united
states
toward
that
republic
the
request
was
granted
and
on
the
th
of
january
a
new
treaty
was
concluded
by
this
treaty
it
was
provided
that
the
interest
due
on
the
awards
in
favor
of
claimants
under
the
convention
of
the
th
of
april
should
be
paid
out
the
th
of
april
and
that
the
principal
of
the
said
awards
and
the
interest
accruing
thereon
shall
be
paid
in
five
years
in
equal
installments
every
three
months
the
said
term
of
five
years
to
commence
on
the
th
day
of
april
aforesaid
the
interest
due
on
the
th
day
of
april
and
the
three
first
of
the
twenty
installments
have
been
paid
seventeen
of
these
installments
remain
unpaid
seven
of
which
are
now
due
the
claims
which
were
left
undecided
by
the
joint
commission
amounting
to
more
than
together
with
other
claims
for
spoliations
on
the
property
of
our
citizens
were
subsequently
presented
to
the
mexican
government
for
payment
and
were
so
far
recognized
that
a
treaty
providing
for
their
examination
and
settlement
by
a
joint
commission
was
concluded
and
signed
at
mexico
on
the
th
day
of
november
this
treaty
was
ratified
by
the
united
states
with
certain
amendments
to
which
no
just
exception
could
have
been
taken
but
it
has
not
yet
received
the
ratification
of
the
mexican
government
in
the
meantime
our
citizens
who
suffered
great
lossesand
some
of
whom
have
been
reduced
from
affluence
to
bankruptcyare
without
remedy
unless
their
rights
be
enforced
by
their
government
such
a
continued
and
unprovoked
series
of
wrongs
could
never
have
been
tolerated
by
the
united
states
had
they
been
committed
by
one
of
the
principal
nations
of
europe
mexico
was
however
a
neighboring
sister
republic
which
following
our
example
had
achieved
her
independence
and
for
whose
success
and
prosperity
all
our
sympathies
were
early
enlisted
the
united
states
were
the
first
to
recognize
her
independence
and
to
receive
her
into
the
family
of
nations
and
have
ever
been
desirous
of
cultivating
with
her
a
good
understanding
we
have
therefore
borne
the
repeated
wrongs
she
has
committed
with
great
patience
in
the
hope
that
a
returning
sense
of
justice
would
ultimately
guide
her
councils
and
that
we
might
if
possible
honorably
avoid
any
hostile
collision
with
her
without
the
previous
authority
of
congress
the
executive
possessed
no
power
to
adopt
or
enforce
adequate
remedies
for
the
injuries
we
had
suffered
or
to
do
more
than
to
be
prepared
to
repel
the
threatened
aggression
on
the
part
of
mexico
after
our
army
and
navy
had
remained
on
the
frontier
and
coasts
of
mexico
for
many
weeks
without
any
hostile
movement
on
her
part
though
her
menaces
were
continued
i
deemed
it
important
to
put
an
end
if
possible
to
this
state
of
things
with
this
view
i
caused
steps
to
be
taken
in
the
month
of
september
last
to
ascertain
distinctly
and
in
an
authentic
form
what
the
designs
of
the
mexican
government
werewhether
it
was
their
intention
to
declare
war
or
invade
texas
or
whether
they
were
disposed
to
adjust
and
settle
in
an
amicable
manner
the
pending
differences
between
the
two
countries
on
the
th
of
november
an
official
answer
was
received
that
the
mexican
government
consented
to
renew
the
diplomatic
relations
which
had
been
suspended
in
march
last
and
for
that
purpose
were
willing
to
accredit
a
minister
from
the
united
states
with
a
sincere
desire
to
preserve
peace
and
restore
relations
of
good
understanding
between
the
two
republics
i
waived
all
ceremony
as
to
the
manner
of
renewing
diplomatic
intercourse
between
them
and
assuming
the
initiative
on
the
th
of
november
a
distinguished
citizen
of
louisiana
was
appointed
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
mexico
clothed
with
full
powers
to
adjust
and
definitively
settle
all
pending
differences
between
the
two
countries
including
those
of
boundary
between
mexico
and
the
state
of
texas
the
minister
appointed
has
set
out
on
his
mission
and
is
probably
by
this
time
near
the
mexican
capital
he
has
been
instructed
to
bring
the
negotiation
with
which
he
is
charged
to
a
conclusion
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
which
it
is
expected
will
be
in
time
to
enable
me
to
communicate
the
result
to
congress
during
the
present
session
until
that
result
is
known
i
forbear
to
recommend
to
congress
such
ulterior
measures
of
redress
for
the
wrongs
and
injuries
we
have
so
long
borne
as
it
would
have
been
proper
to
make
had
no
such
negotiation
been
instituted
congress
appropriated
at
the
last
session
the
sum
of
for
the
payment
of
the
april
and
july
installments
of
the
mexican
indemnities
for
the
year
provided
it
shall
be
ascertained
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
american
government
that
said
installments
have
been
paid
by
the
mexican
government
to
the
agent
appointed
by
the
united
states
to
receive
the
same
in
such
manner
as
to
discharge
all
claim
on
the
mexican
government
and
said
agent
to
be
delinquent
in
remitting
the
money
to
the
united
states
the
unsettled
state
of
our
relations
with
mexico
has
involved
this
subject
in
much
mystery
the
first
information
in
an
authentic
form
from
the
agent
of
the
united
states
appointed
under
the
administration
of
my
predecessor
was
received
at
the
state
department
on
the
th
of
november
last
this
is
contained
in
a
letter
dated
the
th
of
october
addressed
by
him
to
one
of
our
citizens
then
in
mexico
with
a
view
of
having
it
communicated
to
that
department
from
this
it
appears

that
the
agent
on
the
th
of
september
gave
a
receipt
to
the
treasury
of
mexico
for
the
amount
of
the
april
and
july
installments
of
the
indemnity
in
the
same
communication
however
he
asserts
that
he
had
not
received
a
single
dollar
in
cash
but
that
he
holds
such
securities
as
warranted
him
at
the
time
in
giving
the
receipt
and
entertains
no
doubt
but
that
he
will
eventually
obtain
the
money
as
these
installments
appear
never
to
have
been
actually
paid
by
the
government
of
mexico
to
the
agent
and
as
that
government
has
not
therefore
been
released
so
as
to
discharge
the
claim
i
do
not
feel
myself
warranted
in
directing
payment
to
be
made
to
the
claimants
out
of
the
treasury
without
further
legislation
their
case
is
undoubtedly
one
of
much
hardship
and
it
remains
for
congress
to
decide
whether
any
and
what
relief
ought
to
be
granted
to
them
our
minister
to
mexico
has
been
instructed
to
ascertain
the
facts
of
the
case
from
the
mexican
government
in
an
authentic
and
official
form
and
report
the
result
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
my
attention
was
early
directed
to
the
negotiation
which
on
the
th
of
march
last
i
found
pending
at
washington
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
on
the
subject
of
the
oregon
territory
three
several
attempts
had
been
previously
made
to
settle
the
questions
in
dispute
between
the
two
countries
by
negotiation
upon
the
principle
of
compromise
but
each
had
proved
unsuccessful
these
negotiations
took
place
at
london
in
the
years
and
the
two
first
under
the
administration
of
mr
monroe
and
the
last
under
that
of
mr
adams
the
negotiation
of
having
failed
to
accomplish
its
object
resulted
in
the
convention
of
the
th
of
october
of
that
year
by
the
third
article
of
that
convention
it
was
agreed
that
any
country
that
may
be
claimed
by
either
party
on
the
northwest
coast
of
america
westward
of
the
stony
mountains
shall
together
with
its
harbors
bays
and
creeks
and
the
navigation
of
all
rivers
within
the
same
be
free
and
open
for
the
term
of
ten
years
from
the
date
of
the
signature
of
the
present
convention
to
the
vessels
citizens
and
subjects
of
the
two
powers
it
being
well
understood
that
this
agreement
is
not
to
be
construed
to
the
prejudice
of
any
claim
which
either
of
the
two
high
contracting
parties
may
have
to
any
part
of
the
said
country
nor
shall
it
be
taken
to
affect
the
claims
of
any
other
power
or
state
to
any
part
of
the
said
country
the
only
object
of
the
high
contracting
parties
in
that
respect
being
to
prevent
disputes
and
differences
amongst
themselves
the
negotiation
of
was
productive
of
no
result
and
the
convention
of
was
left
unchanged
the
negotiation
of
having
also
failed
to
effect
an
adjustment
by
compromise
resulted
in
the
convention
of
august
by
which
it
was
agreed
to
continue
in
force
for
an
indefinite
period
the
provisions
of
the
third
article
of
the
convention
of
the
th
of
october
and
it
was
further
provided
that
it
shall
be
competent
however
to
either
of
the
contracting
parties
in
case
either
should
think
fit
at
any
time
after
the
th
of
october
on
giving
due
notice
of
twelve
months
to
the
other
contracting
party
to
annul
and
abrogate
this
convention
and
it
shall
in
such
case
be
accordingly
entirely
annulled
and
abrogated
after
the
expiration
of
the
said
term
of
notice
in
these
attempts
to
adjust
the
controversy
the
parallel
of
the
fortyninth
degree
of
north
latitude
had
been
offered
by
the
united
states
to
great
britain
and
in
those
of
and
with
a
further
concession
of
the
free
navigation
of
the
columbia
river
south
of
that
latitude
the
parallel
of
the
fortyninth
degree
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
its
intersection
with
the
northeasternmost
branch
of
the
columbia
and
thence
down
the
channel
of
that
river
to
the
sea
had
been
offered
by
great
britain
with
an
addition
of
a
small
detached
territory
north
of
the
columbia
each
of
these
propositions
had
been
rejected
by
the
parties
respectively
in
october
the
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
states
in
london
was
authorized
to
make
a
similar
offer
to
those
made
in
and
thus
stood
the
question
when
the
negotiation
was
shortly
afterwards
transferred
to
washington
and
on
the
d
of
august
was
formally
opened
under
the
direction
of
my
immediate
predecessor
like
all
the
previous
negotiations
it
was
based
upon
principles
of
compromise
and
the
avowed
purpose
of
the
parties
was
to
treat
of
the
respective
claims
of
the
two
countries
to
the
oregon
territory
with
the
view
to
establish
a
permanent
boundary
between
them
westward
of
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
pacific
ocean
accordingly
on
the
th
of
august
the
british
plenipotentiary
offered
to
divide
the
oregon
territory
by
the
fortyninth
parallel
of
north
latitude
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
northeasternmost
branch
of
the
columbia
river
and
thence
down
that
river
to
the
sea
leaving
the
free
navigation
of
the
river
to
be
enjoyed
in
common
by
both
parties
the
country
south
of
this
line
to
belong
to
the
united
states
and
that
north
of
it
to
great
britain
at
the
same
time
he
proposed
in
addition
to
yield
to
the
united
states
a
detached
territory
north
of
the
columbia
extending
along
the
pacific
and
the
straits
of
fuca
from
bulfinchs
harbor
inclusive
to
hoods
canal
and
to
make
free
to
the
united
states
any
port
or
ports
south
of
latitude
which
they
might
desire
either
on
the
mainland
or
on
quadra
and
vancouvers
island
with
the
exception
of
the
free
ports
this
was
the
same
offer
which
had
been
made
by
the
british
and
rejected
by
the
american
government
in
the
negotiation
of
this
proposition
was
properly
rejected
by
the
american
plenipotentiary
on
the
day
it
was
submitted
this
was
the
only
proposition
of
compromise
offered
by
the
british
plenipotentiary
the
proposition
on
the
part
of
great
britain
having
been
rejected
the
british
plenipotentiary
requested
that
a
proposal
should
be
made
by
the
united
states
for
an
equitable
adjustment
of
the
question
when
i
came
into
office
i
found
this
to
be
the
state
of
the
negotiation
though
entertaining
the
settled
conviction
that
the
british
pretensions
of
title
could
not
be
maintained
to
any
portion
of
the
oregon
territory
upon
any
principle
of
public
law
recognized
by
nations
yet
in
deference
to
what
had
been
done
by
my
predecessors
and
especially
in
consideration
that
propositions
of
compromise
had
been
thrice
made
by
two
preceding
administrations
to
adjust
the
question
on
the
parallel
of
and
in
two
of
them
yielding
to
great
britain
the
free
navigation
of
the
columbia
and
that
the
pending
negotiation
had
been
commenced
on
the
basis
of
compromise
i
deemed
it
to
be
my
duty
not
abruptly
to
break
it
off
in
consideration
too
that
under
the
conventions
of
and
the
citizens
and
subjects
of
the
two
powers
held
a
joint
occupancy
of
the
country
i
was
induced
to
make
another
effort
to
settle
this
longpending
controversy
in
the
spirit
of
moderation
which
had
given
birth
to
the
renewed
discussion
a
proposition
was
accordingly
made
which
was
rejected
by
the
british
plenipotentiary
who
without
submitting
any
other
proposition
suffered
the
negotiation
on
his
part
to
drop
expressing
his
trust
that
the
united
states
would
offer
what
he
saw
fit
to
call
some
further
proposal
for
the
settlement
of
the
oregon
question
more
consistent
with
fairness
and
equity
and
with
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
british
government
the
proposition
thus
offered
and
rejected
repeated
the
offer
of
the
parallel
of
of
north
latitude
which
had
been
made
by
two
preceding
administrations
but
without
proposing
to
surrender
to
great
britain
as
they
had
done
the
free
navigation
of
the
columbia
river
the
right
of
any
foreign
power
to
the
free
navigation
of
any
of
our
rivers
through
the
heart
of
our
country
was
one
which
i
was
unwilling
to
concede
it
also
embraced
a
provision
to
make
free
to
great
britain
any
port
or
ports
on
the
cap
of
quadra
and
vancouvers
island
south
of
this
parallel
had
this
been
a
new
question
coming
under
discussion
for
the
first
time
this
proposition
would
not
have
been
made
the
extraordinary
and
wholly
inadmissible
demands
of
the
british
government
and
the
rejection
of
the
proposition
made
in
deference
alone
to
what
had
been
done
by
my
predecessors
and
the
implied
obligation
which
their
acts
seemed
to
impose
afford
satisfactory
evidence
that
no
compromise
which
the
united
states
ought
to
accept
can
be
effected
with
this
conviction
the
proposition
of
compromise
which
had
been
made
and
rejected
was
by
my
direction
subsequently
withdrawn
and
our
title
to
the
whole
oregon
territory
asserted
and
as
is
believed
maintained
by
irrefragable
facts
and
arguments
the
civilized
world
will
see
in
these
proceedings
a
spirit
of
liberal
concession
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
and
this
government
will
be
relieved
from
all
responsibility
which
may
follow
the
failure
to
settle
the
controversy
all
attempts
at
compromise
having
failed
it
becomes
the
duty
of
congress
to
consider
what
measures
it
may
be
proper
to
adopt
for
the
security
and
protection
of
our
citizens
now
inhabiting
or
who
may
hereafter
inhabit
oregon
and
for
the
maintenance
of
our
just
title
to
that
territory
in
adopting
measures
for
this
purpose
care
should
be
taken
that
nothing
be
done
to
violate
the
stipulations
of
the
convention
of
which
is
still
in
force
the
faith
of
treaties
in
their
letter
and
spirit
has
ever
been
and
i
trust
will
ever
be
scrupulously
observed
by
the
united
states
under
that
convention
a
years
notice
is
required
to
be
given
by
either
party
to
the
other
before
the
joint
occupancy
shall
terminate
and
before
either
can
rightfully
assert
or
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
any
portion
of
the
territory
this
notice
it
would
in
my
judgment
be
proper
to
give
and
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
by
law
for
giving
it
accordingly
and
terminating
in
this
manner
the
convention
of
the
th
of
august
it
will
become
proper
for
congress
to
determine
what
legislation
they
can
in
the
meantime
adopt
without
violating
this
convention
beyond
all
question

the
protection
of
our
laws
and
our
jurisdiction
civil
and
criminal
ought
to
be
immediately
extended
over
our
citizens
in
oregon
they
have
had
just
cause
to
complain
of
our
long
neglect
in
this
particular
and
have
in
consequence
been
compelled
for
their
own
security
and
protection
to
establish
a
provisional
government
for
themselves
strong
in
their
allegiance
and
ardent
in
their
attachment
to
the
united
states
they
have
been
thus
cast
upon
their
own
resources
they
are
anxious
that
our
laws
should
be
extended
over
them
and
i
recommend
that
this
be
done
by
congress
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
in
the
full
extent
to
which
the
british
parliament
have
proceeded
in
regard
to
british
subjects
in
that
territory
by
their
act
of
july
for
regulating
the
fur
trade
and
establishing
a
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
within
certain
parts
of
north
america
by
this
act
great
britain
extended
her
laws
and
jurisdiction
civil
and
criminal
over
her
subjects
engaged
in
the
fur
trade
in
that
territory
by
it
the
courts
of
the
province
of
upper
canada
were
empowered
to
take
cognizance
of
causes
civil
and
criminal
justices
of
the
peace
and
other
judicial
officers
were
authorized
to
be
appointed
in
oregon
with
power
to
execute
all
process
issuing
from
the
courts
of
that
province
and
to
sit
and
hold
courts
of
record
for
the
trial
of
criminal
offenses
and
misdemeanors
not
made
the
subject
of
capital
punishment
and
also
of
civil
cases
where
the
cause
of
action
shall
not
exceed
in
value
the
amount
or
sum
of
lbs
subsequent
to
the
date
of
this
act
of
parliament
a
grant
was
made
from
the
british
crown
to
the
hudsons
bay
company
of
the
exclusive
trade
with
the
indian
tribes
in
the
oregon
territory
subject
to
a
reservation
that
it
shall
not
operate
to
the
exclusion
of
the
subjects
of
any
foreign
states
who
under
or
by
force
of
any
convention
for
the
time
being
between
us
and
such
foreign
states
respectively
may
be
entitled
to
and
shall
be
engaged
in
the
said
trade
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
while
under
this
act
british
subjects
have
enjoyed
the
protection
of
british
laws
and
british
judicial
tribunals
throughout
the
whole
of
oregon
american
citizens
in
the
same
territory
have
enjoyed
no
such
protection
from
their
government
at
the
same
time
the
result
illustrates
the
character
of
our
people
and
their
institutions
in
spite
of
this
neglect
they
have
multiplied
and
their
number
is
rapidly
increasing
in
that
territory
they
have
made
no
appeal
to
arms
but
have
peacefully
fortified
themselves
in
their
new
homes
by
the
adoption
of
republican
institutions
for
themselves
furnishing
another
example
of
the
truth
that
selfgovernment
is
inherent
in
the
american
breast
and
must
prevail
it
is
due
to
them
that
they
should
be
embraced
and
protected
by
our
laws
it
is
deemed
important
that
our
laws
regulating
trade
and
intercourse
with
the
indian
tribes
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
should
be
extended
to
such
tribes
as
dwell
beyond
them
the
increasing
emigration
to
oregon
and
the
care
and
protection
which
is
due
from
the
government
to
its
citizens
in
that
distant
region
make
it
our
duty
as
it
is
our
interest
to
cultivate
amicable
relations
with
the
indian
tribes
of
that
territory
for
this
purpose
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
establishing
an
indian
agency
and
such
subagencies
as
may
be
deemed
necessary
beyond
the
rocky
mountains
for
the
protection
of
emigrants
whilst
on
their
way
to
oregon
against
the
attacks
of
the
indian
tribes
occupying
the
country
through
which
they
pass
i
recommend
that
a
suitable
number
of
stockades
and
blockhouse
forts
be
erected
along
the
usual
route
between
our
frontier
settlements
on
the
missouri
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
that
an
adequate
force
of
mounted
riflemen
be
raised
to
guard
and
protect
them
on
their
journey
the
immediate
adoption
of
these
recommendations
by
congress
will
not
violate
the
provisions
of
the
existing
treaty
it
will
be
doing
nothing
more
for
american
citizens
than
british
laws
have
long
since
done
for
british
subjects
in
the
same
territory
it
requires
several
months
to
perform
the
voyage
by
sea
from
the
atlantic
states
to
oregon
and
although
we
have
a
large
number
of
whale
ships
in
the
pacific
but
few
of
them
afford
an
opportunity
of
interchanging
intelligence
without
great
delay
between
our
settlements
in
that
distant
region
and
the
united
states
an
overland
mail
is
believed
to
be
entirely
practicable
and
the
importance
of
establishing
such
a
mail
at
least
once
a
month
is
submitted
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
it
is
submitted
to
the
wisdom
of
congress
to
determine
whether
at
their
present
session
and
until
after
the
expiration
of
the
years
notice
any
other
measures
may
be
adopted
consistently
with
the
convention
of
for
the
security
of
our
rights
and
the
government
and
protection
of
our
citizens
in
oregon
that
it
will
ultimately
be
wise
and
proper
to
make
liberal
grants
of
land
to
the
patriotic
pioneers
who
amidst
privations
and
dangers
lead
the
way
through
savage
tribes
inhabiting
the
vast
wilderness
intervening
between
our
frontier
settlements
and
oregon
and
who
cultivate
and
are
ever
ready
to
defend
the
soil
i
am
fully
satisfied
to
doubt
whether
they
will
obtain
such
grants
as
soon
as
the
convention
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
shall
have
ceased
to
exist
would
be
to
doubt
the
justice
of
congress
but
pending
the
years
notice
it
is
worthy
of
consideration
whether
a
stipulation
to
this
effect
may
be
made
consistently
with
the
spirit
of
that
convention
the
recommendations
which
i
have
made
as
to
the
best
manner
of
securing
our
rights
in
oregon
are
submitted
to
congress
with
great
deference
should
they
in
their
wisdom
devise
any
other
mode
better
calculated
to
accomplish
the
same
object
it
shall
meet
with
my
hearty
concurrence
at
the
end
of
the
years
notice
should
congress
think
it
proper
to
make
provision
for
giving
that
notice
we
shall
have
reached
a
period
when
the
national
rights
in
oregon
must
either
be
abandoned
or
firmly
maintained
that
they
can
not
be
abandoned
without
a
sacrifice
of
both
national
honor
and
interest
is
too
clear
to
admit
of
doubt
oregon
is
a
part
of
the
north
american
continent
to
which
it
is
confidently
affirmed
the
title
of
the
united
states
is
the
best
now
in
existence
for
the
grounds
on
which
that
title
rests
i
refer
you
to
the
correspondence
of
the
late
and
present
secretary
of
state
with
the
british
plenipotentiary
during
the
negotiation
the
british
proposition
of
compromise
which
would
make
the
columbia
the
line
south
of
with
a
trifling
addition
of
detached
territory
to
the
united
states
north
of
that
river
and
would
leave
on
the
british
side
twothirds
of
the
whole
oregon
territory
including
the
free
navigation
of
the
columbia
and
all
the
valuable
harbors
on
the
pacific
can
never
for
a
moment
be
entertained
by
the
united
states
without
an
abandonment
of
their
just
and
dear
territorial
rights
their
own
selfrespect
and
the
national
honor
for
the
information
of
congress
i
communicate
herewith
the
correspondence
which
took
place
between
the
two
governments
during
the
late
negotiation
the
rapid
extension
of
our
settlements
over
our
territories
heretofore
unoccupied
the
addition
of
new
states
to
our
confederacy
the
expansion
of
free
principles
and
our
rising
greatness
as
a
nation
are
attracting
the
attention
of
the
powers
of
europe
and
lately
the
doctrine
has
been
broached
in
some
of
them
of
a
balance
of
power
on
this
continent
to
check
our
advancement
the
united
states
sincerely
desirous
of
preserving
relations
of
good
understanding
with
all
nations
can
not
in
silence
permit
any
european
interference
on
the
north
american
continent
and
should
any
such
interference
be
attempted
will
be
ready
to
resist
it
at
any
and
all
hazards
it
is
well
known
to
the
american
people
and
to
all
nations
that
this
government
has
never
interfered
with
the
relations
subsisting
between
other
governments
we
have
never
made
ourselves
parties
to
their
wars
or
their
alliances
we
have
not
sought
their
territories
by
conquest
we
have
not
mingled
with
parties
in
their
domestic
struggles
and
believing
our
own
form
of
government
to
be
the
best
we
have
never
attempted
to
propagate
it
by
intrigues
by
diplomacy
or
by
force
we
may
claim
on
this
continent
a
like
exemption
from
european
interference
the
nations
of
america
are
equally
sovereign
and
independent
with
those
of
europe
they
possess
the
same
rights
independent
of
all
foreign
interposition
to
make
war
to
conclude
peace
and
to
regulate
their
internal
affairs
the
people
of
the
united
states
can
not
therefore
view
with
indifference
attempts
of
european
powers
to
interfere
with
the
independent
action
of
the
nations
on
this
continent
the
american
system
of
government
is
entirely
different
from
that
of
europe
jealousy
among
the
different
sovereigns
of
europe
lest
any
one
of
them
might
become
too
powerful
for
the
rest
has
caused
them
anxiously
to
desire
the
establishment
of
what
they
term
the
balance
of
power
it
can
not
be
permitted
to
have
any
application
on
the
north
american
continent
and
especially
to
the
united
states
we
must
ever
maintain
the
principle
that
the
people
of
this
continent
alone
have
the
right
to
decide
their
own
destiny
should
any
portion
of
them
constituting
an
independent
state
propose
to
unite
themselves
with
our
confederacy
this
will
be
a
question
for
them
and
us
to
determine
without
any
foreign
interposition
we
can
never
consent
that
european
powers
shall
interfere
to
prevent
such
a
union
because
it
might
disturb
the
balance
of
power
which
they
may
desire
to
maintain
upon
this
continent
near
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
principle
was
distinctly
announced
to
the
world
in
the
annual
message
of
one
of
my
predecessors
that
the
american
continents
by
the
free
and
independent
condition
which
they
have
assumed
and
maintain
are
henceforth
not
to
be
considered
as
subjects
for
colonization
by
any
european
powers
this
principle
will
apply
with
greatly
increased
force
should
any
european
power
attempt
to
establish
any

new
colony
in
north
america
in
the
existing
circumstances
of
the
world
the
present
is
deemed
a
proper
occasion
to
reiterate
and
reaffirm
the
principle
avowed
by
mr
monroe
and
to
state
my
cordial
concurrence
in
its
wisdom
and
sound
policy
the
reassertion
of
this
principle
especially
in
reference
to
north
america
is
at
this
day
but
the
promulgation
of
a
policy
which
no
european
power
should
cherish
the
disposition
to
resist
existing
rights
of
every
european
nation
should
be
respected
but
it
is
due
alike
to
our
safety
and
our
interests
that
the
efficient
protection
of
our
laws
should
be
extended
over
our
whole
territorial
limits
and
that
it
should
be
distinctly
announced
to
the
world
as
our
settled
policy
that
no
future
european
colony
or
dominion
shall
with
our
consent
be
planted
or
established
on
any
part
of
the
north
american
continent
a
question
has
recently
arisen
under
the
tenth
article
of
the
subsisting
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
prussia
by
this
article
the
consuls
of
the
two
countries
have
the
right
to
sit
as
judges
and
arbitrators
in
such
differences
as
may
arise
between
the
captains
and
crews
of
the
vessels
belonging
to
the
nation
whose
interests
are
committed
to
their
charge
without
the
interference
of
the
local
authorities
unless
the
conduct
of
the
crews
or
of
the
captain
should
disturb
the
order
or
tranquillity
of
the
country
or
the
said
consuls
should
require
their
assistance
to
cause
their
decisions
to
be
carried
into
effect
or
supported
the
prussian
consul
at
new
bedford
in
june
applied
to
mr
justice
story
to
carry
into
effect
a
decision
made
by
him
between
the
captain
and
crew
of
the
prussian
ship
borussia
but
the
request
was
refused
on
the
ground
that
without
previous
legislation
by
congress
the
judiciary
did
not
possess
the
power
to
give
effect
to
this
article
of
the
treaty
the
prussian
government
through
their
minister
here
have
complained
of
this
violation
of
the
treaty
and
have
asked
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
adopt
the
necessary
measures
to
prevent
similar
violations
hereafter
good
faith
to
prussia
as
well
as
to
other
nations
with
whom
we
have
similar
treaty
stipulations
requires
that
these
should
be
faithfully
observed
i
have
deemed
it
proper
therefore
to
lay
the
subject
before
congress
and
to
recommend
such
legislation
as
may
be
necessary
to
give
effect
to
these
treaty
obligations
by
virtue
of
an
arrangement
made
between
the
spanish
government
and
that
of
the
united
states
in
december
american
vessels
since
the
th
of
april
have
been
admitted
to
entry
in
the
ports
of
spain
including
those
of
the
balearic
and
canary
islands
on
payment
of
the
same
tonnage
duty
of
cents
per
ton
as
though
they
had
been
spanish
vessels
and
this
whether
our
vessels
arrive
in
spain
directly
from
the
united
states
or
indirectly
from
any
other
country
when
congress
by
the
act
of
th
july
gave
effect
to
this
arrangement
between
the
two
governments
they
confined
the
reduction
of
tonnage
duty
merely
to
spanish
vessels
coming
from
a
port
in
spain
leaving
the
former
discriminating
duty
to
remain
against
such
vessels
coming
from
a
port
in
any
other
country
it
is
manifestly
unjust
that
whilst
american
vessels
arriving
in
the
ports
of
spain
from
other
countries
pay
no
more
duty
than
spanish
vessels
spanish
vessels
arriving
in
the
ports
of
the
united
states
from
other
countries
should
be
subjected
to
heavy
discriminating
tonnage
duties
this
is
neither
equality
nor
reciprocity
and
is
in
violation
of
the
arrangement
concluded
in
december
between
the
two
countries
the
spanish
government
have
made
repeated
and
earnest
remonstrances
against
this
inequality
and
the
favorable
attention
of
congress
has
been
several
times
invoked
to
the
subject
by
my
predecessors
i
recommend
as
an
act
of
justice
to
spain
that
this
inequality
be
removed
by
congress
and
that
the
discriminating
duties
which
have
been
levied
under
the
act
of
the
th
of
july
on
spanish
vessels
coming
to
the
united
states
from
any
other
foreign
country
be
refunded
this
recommendation
does
not
embrace
spanish
vessels
arriving
in
the
united
states
from
cuba
and
porto
rico
which
will
still
remain
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
june
concerning
tonnage
duty
on
such
vessels
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
july
coffee
was
exempted
from
duty
altogether
this
exemption
was
universal
without
reference
to
the
country
where
it
was
produced
or
the
national
character
of
the
vessel
in
which
it
was
imported
by
the
tariff
act
of
the
th
of
august
this
exemption
from
duty
was
restricted
to
coffee
imported
in
american
vessels
from
the
place
of
its
production
whilst
coffee
imported
under
all
other
circumstances
was
subjected
to
a
duty
of
per
cent
ad
valorem
under
this
act
and
our
existing
treaty
with
the
king
of
the
netherlands
java
coffee
imported
from
the
european
ports
of
that
kingdom
into
the
united
states
whether
in
dutch
or
american
vessels
now
pays
this
rate
of
duty
the
government
of
the
netherlands
complains
that
such
a
discriminating
duty
should
have
been
imposed
on
coffee
the
production
of
one
of
its
colonies
and
which
is
chiefly
brought
from
java
to
the
ports
of
that
kingdom
and
exported
from
thence
to
foreign
countries
our
trade
with
the
netherlands
is
highly
beneficial
to
both
countries
and
our
relations
with
them
have
ever
been
of
the
most
friendly
character
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
i
recommend
that
this
discrimination
should
be
abolished
and
that
the
coffee
of
java
imported
from
the
netherlands
be
placed
upon
the
same
footing
with
that
imported
directly
from
brazil
and
other
countries
where
it
is
produced
under
the
eighth
section
of
the
tariff
act
of
the
th
of
august
a
duty
of
cents
per
gallon
was
imposed
on
port
wine
in
casks
while
on
the
red
wines
of
several
other
countries
when
imported
in
casks
a
duty
of
only
cents
per
gallon
was
imposed
this
discrimination
so
far
as
regarded
the
port
wine
of
portugal
was
deemed
a
violation
of
our
treaty
with
that
power
which
provides
that
no
higher
or
other
duties
shall
be
imposed
on
the
importation
into
the
united
states
of
america
of
any
article
the
growth
produce
or
manufacture
of
the
kingdom
and
possessions
of
portugal
than
such
as
are
or
shall
be
payable
on
the
like
article
being
the
growth
produce
or
manufacture
of
any
other
foreign
country
accordingly
to
give
effect
to
the
treaty
as
well
as
to
the
intention
of
congress
expressed
in
a
proviso
to
the
tariff
act
itself
that
nothing
therein
contained
should
be
so
construed
as
to
interfere
with
subsisting
treaties
with
foreign
nations
a
treasury
circular
was
issued
on
the
th
of
july
which
among
other
things
declared
the
duty
on
the
port
wine
of
portugal
in
casks
under
the
existing
laws
and
treaty
to
be
cents
per
gallon
and
directed
that
the
excess
of
duties
which
had
been
collected
on
such
wine
should
be
refunded
by
virtue
of
another
clause
in
the
same
section
of
the
act
it
is
provided
that
all
imitations
of
port
or
any
other
wines
shall
be
subject
to
the
duty
provided
for
the
genuine
article
imitations
of
port
wine
the
production
of
france
are
imported
to
some
extent
into
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
that
country
now
claims
that
under
a
correct
construction
of
the
act
these
imitations
ought
not
to
pay
a
higher
duty
than
that
imposed
upon
the
original
port
wine
of
portugal
it
appears
to
me
to
be
unequal
and
unjust
that
french
imitations
of
port
wine
should
be
subjected
to
a
duty
of
cents
while
the
more
valuable
article
from
portugal
should
pay
a
duty
of
cents
only
per
gallon
i
therefore
recommend
to
congress
such
legislation
as
may
be
necessary
to
correct
the
inequality
the
late
president
in
his
annual
message
of
december
last
recommended
an
appropriation
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
texan
government
against
the
united
states
which
had
been
previously
adjusted
so
far
as
the
powers
of
the
executive
extend
these
claims
arose
out
of
the
act
of
disarming
a
body
of
texan
troops
under
the
command
of
major
snively
by
an
officer
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
acting
under
the
orders
of
our
government
and
the
forcible
entry
into
the
customhouse
at
bryarlys
landing
on
red
river
by
certain
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
taking
away
therefrom
the
goods
seized
by
the
collector
of
the
customs
as
forfeited
under
the
laws
of
texas
this
was
a
liquidated
debt
ascertained
to
be
due
to
texas
when
an
independent
state
her
acceptance
of
the
terms
of
annexation
proposed
by
the
united
states
does
not
discharge
or
invalidate
the
claim
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
its
payment
the
commissioner
appointed
to
china
during
the
special
session
of
the
senate
in
march
last
shortly
afterwards
set
out
on
his
mission
in
the
united
states
ship
columbus
on
arriving
at
rio
de
janeiro
on
his
passage
the
state
of
his
health
had
become
so
critical
that
by
the
advice
of
his
medical
attendants
he
returned
to
the
united
states
early
in
the
month
of
october
last
commodore
biddle
commanding
the
east
india
squadron
proceeded
on
his
voyage
in
the
columbus
and
was
charged
by
the
commissioner
with
the
duty
of
exchanging
with
the
proper
authorities
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
lately
concluded
with
the
emperor
of
china
since
the
return
of
the
commissioner
to
the
united
states
his
health
has
been
much
improved
and
he
entertains
the
confident
belief
that
he
will
soon
be
able
to
proceed
on
his
mission
unfortunately
differences
continue
to
exist
among
some
of
the
nations
of
south
america
which
following
our
example
have
established
their
independence
while
in
others
internal
dissensions
prevail
it
is
natural
that
our
sympathies
should
be
warmly
enlisted
for
their
welfare
that
we
should
desire
that
all
controversies
between
them
should
be
amicably
adjusted
and
their
governments
administered
in
a
manner
to
protect
the
rights
and
promote
the
prosperity
of
their
people
it
is
contrary
however
to
our
settled
policy
to
interfere
in
their
controversies
whether
external
or
internal
i
have
thus
adverted
to
all
the
subjects
connected
with
our
foreign
relations
to
which
i
deem
it
necess
ary
to
call
your
attention
our
policy
is
not
only
peace
with
all
but
good
will
toward
all
the
powers
of
the
earth
while
we
are
just
to
all
we
require
that
all
shall
be
just
to
us
excepting
the
differences
with
mexico
and
great
britain
our
relations
with
all
civilized
nations
are
of
the
most
satisfactory
character
it
is
hoped
that
in
this
enlightened
age
these
differences
may
be
amicably
adjusted
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
annual
report
to
congress
will
communicate
a
full
statement
of
the
condition
of
our
finances
the
imports
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
were
of
the
value
of
of
which
the
amount
exported
was
leaving
a
balance
of
for
domestic
consumption
the
exports
for
the
same
year
were
of
the
value
of
of
which
the
amount
of
domestic
articles
was
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
during
the
same
year
were
of
which
there
were
derived
from
customs
from
sales
of
public
lands
and
from
incidental
and
miscellaneous
sources
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
of
which
were
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
july
last
was
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
remaining
unpaid
on
the
st
of
october
last
was
further
payments
of
the
public
debt
would
have
been
made
in
anticipation
of
the
period
of
its
reimbursement
under
the
authority
conferred
upon
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
by
the
acts
of
july
and
of
april
and
march
had
not
the
unsettled
state
of
our
relations
with
mexico
menaced
hostile
collision
with
that
power
in
view
of
such
a
contingency
it
was
deemed
prudent
to
retain
in
the
treasury
an
amount
unusually
large
for
ordinary
purposes
a
few
years
ago
our
whole
national
debt
growing
out
of
the
revolution
and
the
war
of
with
great
britain
was
extinguished
and
we
presented
to
the
world
the
rare
and
noble
spectacle
of
a
great
and
growing
people
who
had
fully
discharged
every
obligation
since
that
time
the
existing
debt
has
been
contracted
and
small
as
it
is
in
comparison
with
the
similar
burdens
of
most
other
nations
it
should
be
extinguished
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
should
the
state
of
the
country
permit
and
especially
if
our
foreign
relations
interpose
no
obstacle
it
is
contemplated
to
apply
all
the
moneys
in
the
treasury
as
they
accrue
beyond
what
is
required
for
the
appropriations
by
congress
to
its
liquidation
i
cherish
the
hope
of
soon
being
able
to
congratulate
the
country
on
its
recovering
once
more
the
lofty
position
which
it
so
recently
occupied
our
country
which
exhibits
to
the
world
the
benefits
of
selfgovernment
in
developing
all
the
sources
of
national
prosperity
owes
to
mankind
the
permanent
example
of
a
nation
free
from
the
blighting
influence
of
a
public
debt
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
to
the
importance
of
making
suitable
modifications
and
reductions
of
the
rates
of
duty
imposed
by
our
present
tariff
laws
the
object
of
imposing
duties
on
imports
should
be
to
raise
revenue
to
pay
the
necessary
expenses
of
government
congress
may
undoubtedly
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
discretion
discriminate
in
arranging
the
rates
of
duty
on
different
articles
but
the
discriminations
should
be
within
the
revenue
standard
and
be
made
with
the
view
to
raise
money
for
the
support
of
government
it
becomes
important
to
understand
distinctly
what
is
meant
by
a
revenue
standard
the
maximum
of
which
should
not
be
exceeded
in
the
rates
of
duty
imposed
it
is
conceded
and
experience
proves
that
duties
may
be
laid
so
high
as
to
diminish
or
prohibit
altogether
the
importation
of
any
given
article
and
thereby
lessen
or
destroy
the
revenue
which
at
lower
rates
would
be
derived
from
its
importation
such
duties
exceed
the
revenue
rates
and
are
not
imposed
to
raise
money
for
the
support
of
government
if
congress
levy
a
duty
for
revenue
of
per
cent
on
a
given
article
it
will
produce
a
given
amount
of
money
to
the
treasury
and
will
incidentally
and
necessarily
afford
protection
or
advantage
to
the
amount
of
per
cent
to
the
home
manufacturer
of
a
similar
or
like
article
over
the
importer
if
the
duty
be
raised
to
per
cent
it
will
produce
a
greater
amount
of
money
and
afford
greater
protection
if
it
be
still
raised
to
or
per
cent
and
if
as
it
is
raised
the
revenue
derived
from
it
is
found
to
be
increased
the
protection
or
advantage
will
also
be
increased
but
if
it
be
raised
to
per
cent
and
it
is
found
that
the
revenue
produced
at
that
rate
is
less
than
at
per
cent
it
ceases
to
be
a
revenue
duty
the
precise
point
in
the
ascending
scale
of
duties
at
which
it
is
ascertained
from
experience
that
the
revenue
is
greatest
is
the
maximum
rate
of
duty
which
can
be
laid
for
the
bona
fide
purpose
of
collecting
money
for
the
support
of
government
to
raise
the
duties
higher
than
that
point
and
thereby
diminish
the
amount
collected
is
to
levy
them
for
protection
merely
and
not
for
revenue
as
long
then
as
congress
may
gradually
increase
the
rate
of
duty
on
a
given
article
and
the
revenue
is
increased
by
such
increase
of
duty
they
are
within
the
revenue
standard
when
they
go
beyond
that
point
and
as
they
increase
the
duties
the
revenue
is
diminished
or
destroyed
the
act
ceases
to
have
for
its
object
the
raising
of
money
to
support
government
but
is
for
protection
merely
it
does
not
follow
that
congress
should
levy
the
highest
duty
on
all
articles
of
import
which
they
will
bear
within
the
revenue
standard
for
such
rates
would
probably
produce
a
much
larger
amount
than
the
economical
administration
of
the
government
would
require
nor
does
it
follow
that
the
duties
on
all
articles
should
be
at
the
same
or
a
horizontal
rate
some
articles
will
bear
a
much
higher
revenue
duty
than
others
below
the
maximum
of
the
revenue
standard
congress
may
and
ought
to
discriminate
in
the
rates
imposed
taking
care
so
to
adjust
them
on
different
articles
as
to
produce
in
the
aggregate
the
amount
which
when
added
to
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
of
public
lands
may
be
needed
to
pay
the
economical
expenses
of
the
government
in
levying
a
tariff
of
duties
congress
exercise
the
taxing
power
and
for
purposes
of
revenue
may
select
the
objects
of
taxation
they
may
exempt
certain
articles
altogether
and
permit
their
importation
free
of
duty
on
others
they
may
impose
low
duties
in
these
classes
should
be
embraced
such
articles
of
necessity
as
are
in
general
use
and
especially
such
as
are
consumed
by
the
laborer
and
poor
as
well
as
by
the
wealthy
citizen
care
should
be
taken
that
all
the
great
interests
of
the
country
including
manufactures
agriculture
commerce
navigation
and
the
mechanic
arts
should
as
far
as
may
be
practicable
derive
equal
advantages
from
the
incidental
protection
which
a
just
system
of
revenue
duties
may
afford
taxation
direct
or
indirect
is
a
burden
and
it
should
be
so
imposed
as
to
operate
as
equally
as
may
be
on
all
classes
in
the
proportion
of
their
ability
to
bear
it
to
make
the
taxing
power
an
actual
benefit
to
one
class
necessarily
increases
the
burden
of
the
others
beyond
their
proportion
and
would
be
manifestly
unjust
the
terms
protection
to
domestic
industry
are
of
popular
import
but
they
should
apply
under
a
just
system
to
all
the
various
branches
of
industry
in
our
country
the
farmer
or
planter
who
toils
yearly
in
his
fields
is
engaged
in
domestic
industry
and
is
as
much
entitled
to
have
his
labor
protected
as
the
manufacturer
the
man
of
commerce
the
navigator
or
the
mechanic
who
are
engaged
also
in
domestic
industry
in
their
different
pursuits
the
joint
labors
of
all
these
classes
constitute
the
aggregate
of
the
domestic
industry
of
the
nation
and
they
are
equally
entitled
to
the
nations
protection
no
one
of
them
can
justly
claim
to
be
the
exclusive
recipient
of
protection
which
can
only
be
afforded
by
increasing
burdens
on
the
domestic
industry
of
the
others
if
these
views
be
correct
it
remains
to
inquire
how
far
the
tariff
act
of
is
consistent
with
them
that
many
of
the
provisions
of
that
act
are
in
violation
of
the
cardinal
principles
here
laid
down
all
must
concede
the
rates
of
duty
imposed
by
it
on
some
articles
are
prohibitory
and
on
others
so
high
as
greatly
to
diminish
importations
and
to
produce
a
less
amount
of
revenue
than
would
be
derived
from
lower
rates
they
operate
as
protection
merely
to
one
branch
of
domestic
industry
by
taxing
other
branches
by
the
introduction
of
minimums
or
assumed
and
false
values
and
by
the
imposition
of
specific
duties
the
injustice
and
inequality
of
the
act
of
in
its
practical
operations
on
different
classes
and
pursuits
are
seen
and
felt
many
of
the
oppressive
duties
imposed
by
it
under
the
operation
of
these
principles
range
from
per
cent
to
more
than
per
cent
they
are
prohibitory
on
some
articles
and
partially
so
on
others
and
bear
most
heavily
on
articles
of
common
necessity
and
but
lightly
on
articles
of
luxury
it
is
so
framed
that
much
the
greatest
burden
which
it
imposes
is
thrown
on
labor
and
the
poorer
classes
who
are
least
able
to
bear
it
while
it
protects
capital
and
exempts
the
rich
from
paying
their
just
proportion
of
the
taxation
required
for
the
support
of
government
while
it
protects
the
capital
of
the
wealthy
manufacturer
and
increases
his
profits
it
does
not
benefit
the
operatives
or
laborers
in
his
employment
whose
wages
have
not
been
increased
by
it
articles
of
prime
necessity
or
of
coarse
quality
and
low
price
used
by
the
masses
of
the
people
are
in
many
instances
subjected
by
it
to
heavy
taxes
while
articles
of
finer
quality
and
higher
price
or
of
luxury
which
can
be
used
only
by
the
opulent
are
lightly
taxed
it
imposes
heavy
and
unjust
burdens
on
the
farmer
the
planter
the
commercial
man
and
those
of
all
other
pursuits
except
the
capitalist
who
has
made
his
investments
in
manufactures
all
the
great
interests
of
the
country
are
not
as
nearly
as
may
be
practicable
equally
protected
by
it
the
government
in
theory
knows
no
distinction
of
persons
or
classes
and
should
not
bestow
upon
some
favors
and
privileges
which
all
others
may
not
enjoy
it
was
the
purpose
of
its
illustrious
founders
to
base
the
institutions

which
they
reared
upon
the
great
and
unchanging
principles
of
justice
and
equity
conscious
that
if
administered
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
were
conceived
they
would
be
felt
only
by
the
benefits
which
they
diffused
and
would
secure
for
themselves
a
defense
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
more
powerful
than
standing
armies
and
all
the
means
and
appliances
invented
to
sustain
governments
founded
in
injustice
and
oppression
the
wellknown
fact
that
the
tariff
act
of
was
passed
by
a
majority
of
one
vote
in
the
senate
and
two
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
that
some
of
those
who
felt
themselves
constrained
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
existing
at
the
time
to
vote
in
its
favor
proclaimed
its
defects
and
expressed
their
determination
to
aid
in
its
modification
on
the
first
opportunity
affords
strong
and
conclusive
evidence
that
it
was
not
intended
to
be
permanent
and
of
the
expediency
and
necessity
of
its
thorough
revision
in
recommending
to
congress
a
reduction
of
the
present
rates
of
duty
and
a
revision
and
modification
of
the
act
of
i
am
far
from
entertaining
opinions
unfriendly
to
the
manufacturers
on
the
contrary
i
desire
to
see
them
prosperous
as
far
as
they
can
be
so
without
imposing
unequal
burdens
on
other
interests
the
advantage
under
any
system
of
indirect
taxation
even
within
the
revenue
standard
must
be
in
favor
of
the
manufacturing
interest
and
of
this
no
other
interest
will
complain
i
recommend
to
congress
the
abolition
of
the
minimum
principle
or
assumed
arbitrary
and
false
values
and
of
specific
duties
and
the
substitution
in
their
place
of
ad
valorem
duties
as
the
fairest
and
most
equitable
indirect
tax
which
can
be
imposed
by
the
ad
valorem
principle
all
articles
are
taxed
according
to
their
cost
or
value
and
those
which
are
of
inferior
quality
or
of
small
cost
bear
only
the
just
proportion
of
the
tax
with
those
which
are
of
superior
quality
or
greater
cost
the
articles
consumed
by
all
are
taxed
at
the
same
rate
a
system
of
ad
valorem
revenue
duties
with
proper
discriminations
and
proper
guards
against
frauds
in
collecting
them
it
is
not
doubted
will
afford
ample
incidental
advantages
to
the
manufacturers
and
enable
them
to
derive
as
great
profits
as
can
be
derived
from
any
other
regular
business
it
is
believed
that
such
a
system
strictly
within
the
revenue
standard
will
place
the
manufacturing
interests
on
a
stable
footing
and
inure
to
their
permanent
advantage
while
it
will
as
nearly
as
may
be
practicable
extend
to
all
the
great
interests
of
the
country
the
incidental
protection
which
can
be
afforded
by
our
revenue
laws
such
a
system
when
once
firmly
established
would
be
permanent
and
not
be
subject
to
the
constant
complaints
agitations
and
changes
which
must
ever
occur
when
duties
are
not
laid
for
revenue
but
for
the
protection
merely
of
a
favored
interest
in
the
deliberations
of
congress
on
this
subject
it
is
hoped
that
a
spirit
of
mutual
concession
and
compromise
between
conflicting
interests
may
prevail
and
that
the
result
of
their
labors
may
be
crowned
with
the
happiest
consequences
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
is
provided
that
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law
a
public
treasury
was
undoubtedly
contemplated
and
intended
to
be
created
in
which
the
public
money
should
be
kept
from
the
period
of
collection
until
needed
for
public
uses
in
the
collection
and
disbursement
of
the
public
money
no
agencies
have
ever
been
employed
by
law
except
such
as
were
appointed
by
the
government
directly
responsible
to
it
and
under
its
control
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
money
should
be
confided
to
a
public
treasury
created
by
law
and
under
like
responsibility
and
control
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
could
have
intended
that
a
treasury
should
be
created
as
a
place
of
deposit
and
safekeeping
of
the
public
money
which
was
irresponsible
to
the
government
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution
by
the
act
of
the
d
of
september
to
establish
the
treasury
department
provided
for
the
appointment
of
a
treasurer
and
made
it
his
duty
to
receive
and
keep
the
moneys
of
the
united
states
and
at
all
times
to
submit
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
comptroller
or
either
of
them
the
inspection
of
the
moneys
in
his
hands
that
banks
national
or
state
could
not
have
been
intended
to
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
the
treasury
spoken
of
in
the
constitution
as
keepers
of
the
public
money
is
manifest
from
the
fact
that
at
that
time
there
was
no
national
bank
and
but
three
or
four
state
banks
of
limited
capital
existed
in
the
country
their
employment
as
depositories
was
at
first
resorted
to
to
a
limited
extent
but
with
no
avowed
intention
of
continuing
them
permanently
in
place
of
the
treasury
of
the
constitution
when
they
were
afterwards
from
time
to
time
employed
it
was
from
motives
of
supposed
convenience
our
experience
has
shown
that
when
banking
corporations
have
been
the
keepers
of
the
public
money
and
been
thereby
made
in
effect
the
treasury
the
government
can
have
no
guaranty
that
it
can
command
the
use
of
its
own
money
for
public
purposes
the
late
bank
of
the
united
states
proved
to
be
faithless
the
state
banks
which
were
afterwards
employed
were
faithless
but
a
few
years
ago
with
millions
of
public
money
in
their
keeping
the
government
was
brought
almost
to
bankruptcy
and
the
public
credit
seriously
impaired
because
of
their
inability
or
indisposition
to
pay
on
demand
to
the
public
creditors
in
the
only
currency
recognized
by
the
constitution
their
failure
occurred
in
a
period
of
peace
and
great
inconvenience
and
loss
were
suffered
by
the
public
from
it
had
the
country
been
involved
in
a
foreign
war
that
inconvenience
and
loss
would
have
been
much
greater
and
might
have
resulted
in
extreme
public
calamity
the
public
money
should
not
be
mingled
with
the
private
funds
of
banks
or
individuals
or
be
used
for
private
purposes
when
it
is
placed
in
banks
for
safekeeping
it
is
in
effect
loaned
to
them
without
interest
and
is
loaned
by
them
upon
interest
to
the
borrowers
from
them
the
public
money
is
converted
into
banking
capital
and
is
used
and
loaned
out
for
the
private
profit
of
bank
stockholders
and
when
called
for
as
was
the
case
in
it
may
be
in
the
pockets
of
the
borrowers
from
the
banks
instead
of
being
in
the
public
treasury
contemplated
by
the
constitution
the
framers
of
the
constitution
could
never
have
intended
that
the
money
paid
into
the
treasury
should
be
thus
converted
to
private
use
and
placed
beyond
the
control
of
the
government
banks
which
hold
the
public
money
are
often
tempted
by
a
desire
of
gain
to
extend
their
loans
increase
their
circulation
and
thus
stimulate
if
not
produce
a
spirit
of
speculation
and
extravagance
which
sooner
or
later
must
result
in
ruin
to
thousands
if
the
public
money
be
not
permitted
to
be
thus
used
but
be
kept
in
the
treasure
and
paid
out
to
the
public
creditors
in
gold
and
silver
the
temptation
afforded
by
its
deposit
with
banks
to
an
undue
expansion
of
their
business
would
be
checked
while
the
amount
of
the
constitutional
currency
left
in
circulation
would
be
enlarged
by
its
employment
in
the
public
collections
and
disbursements
and
the
banks
themselves
would
in
consequence
be
found
in
a
safer
and
sounder
condition
at
present
state
banks
are
employed
as
depositories
but
without
adequate
regulation
of
law
whereby
the
public
money
can
be
secured
against
the
casualties
and
excesses
revulsions
suspensions
and
defalcations
to
which
from
overissues
overtrading
an
inordinate
desire
for
gain
or
other
causes
they
are
constantly
exposed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
in
all
cases
when
it
was
practicable
taken
collateral
security
for
the
amount
which
they
hold
by
the
pledge
of
stocks
of
the
united
states
or
such
of
the
states
as
were
in
good
credit
some
of
the
deposit
banks
have
given
this
description
of
security
and
others
have
declined
to
do
so
entertaining
the
opinion
that
the
separation
of
the
moneys
of
the
government
from
banking
institutions
is
indispensable
for
the
safety
of
the
funds
of
the
government
and
the
rights
of
the
people
i
recommend
to
congress
that
provision
be
made
by
law
for
such
separation
and
that
a
constitutional
treasury
be
created
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
money
the
constitutional
treasury
recommended
is
designed
as
a
secure
depository
for
the
public
money
without
any
power
to
make
loans
or
discounts
or
to
issue
any
paper
whatever
as
a
currency
or
circulation
i
can
not
doubt
that
such
a
treasury
as
was
contemplated
by
the
constitution
should
be
independent
of
all
banking
corporations
the
money
of
the
people
should
be
kept
in
the
treasury
of
the
people
created
by
law
and
be
in
the
custody
of
agents
of
the
people
chosen
by
themselves
according
to
the
forms
of
the
constitutionagents
who
are
directly
responsible
to
the
government
who
are
under
adequate
bonds
and
oaths
and
who
are
subject
to
severe
punishments
for
any
embezzlement
private
use
or
misapplication
of
the
public
funds
and
for
any
failure
in
other
respects
to
perform
their
duties
to
say
that
the
people
or
their
government
are
incompetent
or
not
to
be
trusted
with
the
custody
of
their
own
money
in
their
own
treasury
provided
by
themselves
but
must
rely
on
the
presidents
cashiers
and
stockholders
of
banking
corporations
not
appointed
by
them
nor
responsible
to
them
would
be
to
concede
that
they
are
incompetent
for
selfgovernment
in
recommending
the
establishment
of
a
constitutional
treasury
in
which
the
public
money
shall
be
kept
i
desire
that
adequate
provision
be
made
by
law
for
its
safety
and
that
all
executive
discretion
or
control
over
it
shall
be
removed
except
such
as
may
be
necessary
in
directing
its
disbursement
in
pursuance
of
appropriations
made
by
law
under
our
present
land
system
limiting
the
minimum
price
at
which
the
public
lands
can
be
entered
to
per
acre
large
quantities
of
lands
of
inferior
quality
remain
unsold
because
they
will
not
command
that
price
from
the
records
of

the
general
land
office
it
appears
that
of
the
public
lands
remaining
unsold
in
the
several
states
and
territories
in
which
they
are
situated
acres
have
been
in
the
market
subject
to
entry
more
than
twenty
years
acres
for
more
than
fifteen
years
acres
for
more
than
ten
years
and
acres
for
more
than
five
years
much
the
largest
portion
of
these
lands
will
continue
to
be
unsalable
at
the
minimum
price
at
which
they
are
permitted
to
be
sold
so
long
as
large
territories
of
lands
from
which
the
more
valuable
portions
have
not
been
selected
are
annually
brought
into
market
by
the
government
with
the
view
to
the
sale
and
settlement
of
these
inferior
lands
i
recommend
that
the
price
be
graduated
and
reduced
below
the
present
minimum
rate
confining
the
sales
at
the
reduced
prices
to
settlers
and
cultivators
in
limited
quantities
if
graduated
and
reduced
in
price
for
a
limited
term
to
per
acre
and
after
the
expiration
of
that
period
for
a
second
and
third
term
to
lower
rates
a
large
portion
of
these
lands
would
be
purchased
and
many
worthy
citizens
who
are
unable
to
pay
higher
rates
could
purchase
homes
for
themselves
and
their
families
by
adopting
the
policy
of
graduation
and
reduction
of
price
these
inferior
lands
will
be
sold
for
their
real
value
while
the
states
in
which
they
lie
will
be
freed
from
the
inconvenience
if
not
injustice
to
which
they
are
subjected
in
consequence
of
the
united
states
continuing
to
own
large
quantities
of
the
public
lands
within
their
borders
not
liable
to
taxation
for
the
support
of
their
local
governments
i
recommend
the
continuance
of
the
policy
of
granting
preemptions
in
its
most
liberal
extent
to
all
those
who
have
settled
or
may
hereafter
settle
on
the
public
lands
whether
surveyed
or
unsurveyed
to
which
the
indian
title
may
have
been
extinguished
at
the
time
of
settlement
it
has
been
found
by
experience
that
in
consequence
of
combinations
of
purchasers
and
other
causes
a
very
small
quantity
of
the
public
lands
when
sold
at
public
auction
commands
a
higher
price
than
the
minimum
rates
established
by
law
the
settlers
on
the
public
lands
are
however
but
rarely
able
to
secure
their
homes
and
improvements
at
the
public
sales
at
that
rate
because
these
combinations
by
means
of
the
capital
they
command
and
their
superior
ability
to
purchase
render
it
impossible
for
the
settler
to
compete
with
them
in
the
market
by
putting
down
all
competition
these
combinations
of
capitalists
and
speculators
are
usually
enabled
to
purchase
the
lands
including
the
improvements
of
the
settlers
at
the
minimum
price
of
the
government
and
either
turn
them
out
of
their
homes
or
extort
from
them
according
to
their
ability
to
pay
double
or
quadruple
the
amount
paid
for
them
to
the
government
it
is
to
the
enterprise
and
perseverance
of
the
hardy
pioneers
of
the
west
who
penetrate
the
wilderness
with
their
families
suffer
the
dangers
the
privations
and
hardships
attending
the
settlement
of
a
new
country
and
prepare
the
way
for
the
body
of
emigrants
who
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
usually
follow
them
that
we
are
in
a
great
degree
indebted
for
the
rapid
extension
and
aggrandizement
of
our
country
experience
has
proved
that
no
portion
of
our
population
are
more
patriotic
than
the
hardy
and
brave
men
of
the
frontier
or
more
ready
to
obey
the
call
of
their
country
and
to
defend
her
rights
and
her
honor
whenever
and
by
whatever
enemy
assailed
they
should
be
protected
from
the
grasping
speculator
and
secured
at
the
minimum
price
of
the
public
lands
in
the
humble
homes
which
they
have
improved
by
their
labor
with
this
end
in
view
all
vexatious
or
unnecessary
restrictions
imposed
upon
them
by
the
existing
preemption
laws
should
be
repealed
or
modified
it
is
the
true
policy
of
the
government
to
afford
facilities
to
its
citizens
to
become
the
owners
of
small
portions
of
our
vast
public
domain
at
low
and
moderate
rates
the
present
system
of
managing
the
mineral
lands
of
the
united
states
is
believed
to
be
radically
defective
more
than
acres
of
the
public
lands
supposed
to
contain
lead
and
other
minerals
have
been
reserved
from
sale
and
numerous
leases
upon
them
have
been
granted
to
individuals
upon
a
stipulated
rent
the
system
of
granting
leases
has
proved
to
be
not
only
unprofitable
to
the
government
but
unsatisfactory
to
the
citizens
who
have
gone
upon
the
lands
and
must
if
continued
lay
the
foundation
of
much
future
difficulty
between
the
government
and
the
lessees
according
to
the
official
records
the
amount
of
rents
received
by
the
government
for
the
years
and
was
while
the
expenses
of
the
system
during
the
same
period
including
salaries
of
superintendents
agents
clerks
and
incidental
expenses
were
the
income
being
less
than
onefourth
of
the
expenses
to
this
pecuniary
loss
may
be
added
the
injury
sustained
by
the
public
in
consequence
of
the
destruction
of
timber
and
the
careless
and
wasteful
manner
of
working
the
mines
the
system
has
given
rise
to
much
litigation
between
the
united
states
and
individual
citizens
producing
irritation
and
excitement
in
the
mineral
region
and
involving
the
government
in
heavy
additional
expenditures
it
is
believed
that
similar
losses
and
embarrassments
will
continue
to
occur
while
the
present
system
of
leasing
these
lands
remains
unchanged
these
lands
are
now
under
the
superintendence
and
care
of
the
war
department
with
the
ordinary
duties
of
which
they
have
no
proper
or
natural
connection
i
recommend
the
repeal
of
the
present
system
and
that
these
lands
be
placed
under
the
superintendence
and
management
of
the
general
land
office
as
other
public
lands
and
be
brought
into
market
and
sold
upon
such
terms
as
congress
in
their
wisdom
may
prescribe
reserving
to
the
government
an
equitable
percentage
of
the
gross
amount
of
mineral
product
and
that
the
preemption
principle
be
extended
to
resident
miners
and
settlers
upon
them
at
the
minimum
price
which
may
be
established
by
congress
i
refer
you
to
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
information
respecting
the
present
situation
of
the
army
and
its
operations
during
the
past
year
the
state
of
our
defenses
the
condition
of
the
public
works
and
our
relations
with
the
various
indian
tribes
within
our
limits
or
upon
our
borders
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
suggestions
contained
in
that
report
in
relation
to
these
prominent
objects
of
national
interest
when
orders
were
given
during
the
past
summer
for
concentrating
a
military
force
on
the
western
frontier
of
texas
our
troops
were
widely
dispersed
and
in
small
detachments
occupying
posts
remote
from
each
other
the
prompt
and
expeditious
manner
in
which
an
army
embracing
more
than
half
our
peace
establishment
was
drawn
together
on
an
emergency
so
sudden
reflects
great
credit
on
the
officers
who
were
intrusted
with
the
execution
of
these
orders
as
well
as
upon
the
discipline
of
the
army
itself
to
be
in
strength
to
protect
and
defend
the
people
and
territory
of
texas
in
the
event
mexico
should
commence
hostilities
or
invade
her
territories
with
a
large
army
which
she
threatened
i
authorized
the
general
assigned
to
the
command
of
the
army
of
occupation
to
make
requisitions
for
additional
forces
from
several
of
the
states
nearest
the
texan
territory
and
which
could
most
expeditiously
furnish
them
if
in
his
opinion
a
larger
force
than
that
under
his
command
and
the
auxiliary
aid
which
under
like
circumstances
he
was
authorized
to
receive
from
texas
should
be
required
the
contingency
upon
which
the
exercise
of
this
authority
depended
has
not
occurred
the
circumstances
under
which
two
companies
of
state
artillery
from
the
city
of
new
orleans
were
sent
into
texas
and
mustered
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
are
fully
stated
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
i
recommend
to
congress
that
provision
be
made
for
the
payment
of
these
troops
as
well
as
a
small
number
of
texan
volunteers
whom
the
commanding
general
thought
it
necessary
to
receive
or
muster
into
our
service
during
the
last
summer
the
first
regiment
of
dragoons
made
extensive
excursions
through
the
indian
country
on
our
borders
a
part
of
them
advancing
nearly
to
the
possessions
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
in
the
north
and
a
part
as
far
as
the
south
pass
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
head
waters
of
the
tributary
streams
of
the
colorado
of
the
west
the
exhibition
of
this
military
force
among
the
indian
tribes
in
those
distant
regions
and
the
councils
held
with
them
by
the
commanders
of
the
expeditions
it
is
believed
will
have
a
salutary
influence
in
restraining
them
from
hostilities
among
themselves
and
maintaining
friendly
relations
between
them
and
the
united
states
an
interesting
account
of
one
of
these
excursions

been
employed
since
in
exploring
the
country
west
of
the
mississippi
and
beyond
the
rocky
mountains
two
expeditions
have
already
been
brought
to
a
close
and
the
reports
of
that
scientific
and
enterprising
officer
have
furnished
much
interesting
and
valuable
information
he
is
now
engaged
in
a
third
expedition
but
it
is
not
expected
that
this
arduous
service
will
be
completed
in
season
to
enable
me
to
communicate
the
result
to
congress
at
the
present
session
our
relations
with
the
indian
tribes
are
of
a
favorable
character
the
policy
of
removing
them
to
a
country
designed
for
their
permanent
residence
west
of
the
mississippi
and
without
the
limits
of
the
organized
states
and
territories
is
better
appreciated
by
them
than
it
was
a
few
years
ago
while
education
is
now
attended
to
and
the
habits
of
civilized
life
are
gaining
ground
among
them
serious
difficulties
of
long
standing
continue
to
distract
the
several
parties
into
which
the
cherokees
are
unhappily
divided
the
efforts
of
the
government
to
adjust
the
difficulties
between
them
have
heretofore
proved
unsuccessful
and
there
remains
no
probability
that
this
desirable
object
can
be
accomplished
without
the
aid
of

further
legislation
by
congress
i
will
at
an
early
period
of
your
session
present
the
subject
for
your
consideration
accompanied
with
an
exposition
of
the
complaints
and
claims
of
the
several
parties
into
which
the
nation
is
divided
with
a
view
to
the
adoption
of
such
measures
by
congress
as
may
enable
the
executive
to
do
justice
to
them
respectively
and
to
put
an
end
if
possible
to
the
dissensions
which
have
long
prevailed
and
still
prevail
among
them
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
the
present
condition
of
that
branch
of
the
national
defense
and
for
grave
suggestions
having
for
their
object
the
increase
of
its
efficiency
and
a
greater
economy
in
its
management
during
the
past
year
the
officers
and
men
have
performed
their
duty
in
a
satisfactory
manner
the
orders
which
have
been
given
have
been
executed
with
promptness
and
fidelity
a
larger
force
than
has
often
formed
one
squadron
under
our
flag
was
readily
concentrated
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
apparently
without
unusual
effort
it
is
especially
to
be
observed
that
notwithstanding
the
union
of
so
considerable
a
force
no
act
was
committed
that
even
the
jealousy
of
an
irritated
power
could
construe
as
an
act
of
aggression
and
that
the
commander
of
the
squadron
and
his
officers
in
strict
conformity
with
their
instructions
holding
themselves
ever
ready
for
the
most
active
duty
have
achieved
the
still
purer
glory
of
contributing
to
the
preservation
of
peace
it
is
believed
that
at
all
our
foreign
stations
the
honor
of
our
flag
has
been
maintained
and
that
generally
our
ships
of
war
have
been
distinguished
for
their
good
discipline
and
order
i
am
happy
to
add
that
the
display
of
maritime
force
which
was
required
by
the
events
of
the
summer
has
been
made
wholly
within
the
usual
appropriations
for
the
service
of
the
year
so
that
no
additional
appropriations
are
required
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
with
it
the
navigating
interests
have
steadily
and
rapidly
increased
since
the
organization
of
our
government
until
it
is
believed
we
are
now
second
to
but
one
power
in
the
world
and
at
no
distant
day
we
shall
probably
be
inferior
to
none
exposed
as
they
must
be
it
has
been
a
wise
policy
to
afford
to
these
important
interests
protection
with
our
ships
of
war
distributed
in
the
great
highways
of
trade
throughout
the
world
for
more
than
thirty
years
appropriations
have
been
made
and
annually
expended
for
the
gradual
increase
of
our
naval
forces
in
peace
our
navy
performs
the
important
duty
of
protecting
our
commerce
and
in
the
event
of
war
will
be
as
it
has
been
a
most
efficient
means
of
defense
the
successful
use
of
steam
navigation
on
the
ocean
has
been
followed
by
the
introduction
of
war
steamers
in
great
and
increasing
numbers
into
the
navies
of
the
principal
maritime
powers
of
the
world
a
due
regard
to
our
own
safety
and
to
an
efficient
protection
to
our
large
and
increasing
commerce
demands
a
corresponding
increase
on
our
part
no
country
has
greater
facilities
for
the
construction
of
vessels
of
this
description
than
ours
or
can
promise
itself
greater
advantages
from
their
employment
they
are
admirably
adapted
to
the
protection
of
our
commerce
to
the
rapid
transmission
of
intelligence
and
to
the
coast
defense
in
pursuance
of
the
wise
policy
of
a
gradual
increase
of
our
navy
large
supplies
of
liveoak
timber
and
other
materials
for
shipbuilding
have
been
collected
and
are
now
under
shelter
and
in
a
state
of
good
preservation
while
iron
steamers
can
be
built
with
great
facility
in
various
parts
of
the
union
the
use
of
iron
as
a
material
especially
in
the
construction
of
steamers
which
can
enter
with
safety
many
of
the
harbors
along
our
coast
now
inaccessible
to
vessels
of
greater
draft
and
the
practicability
of
constructing
them
in
the
interior
strongly
recommend
that
liberal
appropriations
should
be
made
for
this
important
object
whatever
may
have
been
our
policy
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
government
when
the
nation
was
in
its
infancy
our
shipping
interests
and
commerce
comparatively
small
our
resources
limited
our
population
sparse
and
scarcely
extending
beyond
the
limits
of
the
original
thirteen
states
that
policy
must
be
essentially
different
now
that
we
have
grown
from
three
to
more
than
twenty
millions
of
people
that
our
commerce
carried
in
our
own
ships
is
found
in
every
sea
and
that
our
territorial
boundaries
and
settlements
have
been
so
greatly
expanded
neither
our
commerce
nor
our
long
line
of
coast
on
the
ocean
and
on
the
lakes
can
be
successfully
defended
against
foreign
aggression
by
means
of
fortifications
alone
these
are
essential
at
important
commercial
and
military
points
but
our
chief
reliance
for
this
object
must
be
on
a
wellorganized
efficient
navy
the
benefits
resulting
from
such
a
navy
are
not
confined
to
the
atlantic
states
the
productions
of
the
interior
which
seek
a
market
abroad
are
directly
dependent
on
the
safety
and
freedom
of
our
commerce
the
occupation
of
the
balize
below
new
orleans
by
a
hostile
force
would
embarrass
if
not
stagnate
the
whole
export
trade
of
the
mississippi
and
affect
the
value
of
the
agricultural
products
of
the
entire
valley
of
that
mighty
river
and
its
tributaries
it
has
never
been
our
policy
to
maintain
large
standing
armies
in
time
of
peace
they
are
contrary
to
the
genius
of
our
free
institutions
would
impose
heavy
burdens
on
the
people
and
be
dangerous
to
public
liberty
our
reliance
for
protection
and
defense
on
the
land
must
be
mainly
on
our
citizen
soldiers
who
will
be
ever
ready
as
they
ever
have
been
ready
in
times
past
to
rush
with
alacrity
at
the
call
of
their
country
to
her
defense
this
description
of
force
however
can
not
defend
our
coast
harbors
and
inland
seas
nor
protect
our
commerce
on
the
ocean
or
the
lakes
these
must
be
protected
by
our
navy
considering
an
increased
naval
force
and
especially
of
steam
vessels
corresponding
with
our
growth
and
importance
as
a
nation
and
proportioned
to
the
increased
and
increasing
naval
power
of
other
nations
of
vast
importance
as
regards
our
safety
and
the
great
and
growing
interests
to
be
protected
by
it
i
recommend
the
subject
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
herewith
communicated
contains
a
detailed
statement
of
the
operations
of
his
department
during
the
pass
year
it
will
be
seen
that
the
income
from
postages
will
fall
short
of
the
expenditures
for
the
year
between
and
this
deficiency
has
been
caused
by
the
reduction
of
the
rates
of
postage
which
was
made
by
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
last
no
principle
has
been
more
generally
acquiesced
in
by
the
people
than
that
this
department
should
sustain
itself
by
limiting
its
expenditures
to
its
income
congress
has
never
sought
to
make
it
a
source
of
revenue
for
general
purposes
except
for
a
short
period
during
the
last
war
with
great
britain
nor
should
it
ever
become
a
charge
on
the
general
treasury
if
congress
shall
adhere
to
this
principle
as
i
think
they
ought
it
will
be
necessary
either
to
curtail
the
present
mail
service
so
as
to
reduce
the
expenditures
or
so
to
modify
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
last
as
to
improve
its
revenues
the
extension
of
the
mail
service
and
the
additional
facilities
which
will
be
demanded
by
the
rapid
extension
and
increase
of
population
on
our
western
frontier
will
not
admit
of
such
curtailment
as
will
materially
reduce
the
present
expenditures
in
the
adjustment
of
the
tariff
of
postages
the
interests
of
the
people
demand
that
the
lowest
rates
be
adopted
which
will
produce
the
necessary
revenue
to
meet
the
expenditures
of
the
department
i
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
on
this
subject
under
the
belief
that
such
a
modification
of
the
late
law
may
be
made
as
will
yield
sufficient
revenue
without
further
calls
on
the
treasury
and
with
very
little
change
in
the
present
rates
of
postage
proper
measures
have
been
taken
in
pursuance
of
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
last
for
the
establishment
of
lines
of
mail
steamers
between
this
and
foreign
countries
the
importance
of
this
service
commends
itself
strongly
to
favorable
consideration
with
the
growth
of
our
country
the
public
business
which
devolves
on
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
has
greatly
increased
in
some
respects
the
distribution
of
duties
among
them
seems
to
be
incongruous
and
many
of
these
might
be
transferred
from
one
to
another
with
advantage
to
the
public
interests
a
more
auspicious
time
for
the
consideration
of
this
subject
by
congress
with
a
view
to
system
in
the
organization
of
the
several
departments
and
a
more
appropriate
division
of
the
public
business
will
not
probably
occur
the
most
important
duties
of
the
state
department
relate
to
our
foreign
affairs
by
the
great
enlargement
of
the
family
of
nations
the
increase
of
our
commerce
and
the
corresponding
extension
of
our
consular
system
the
business
of
this
department
has
been
greatly
increased
in
its
present
organization
many
duties
of
a
domestic
nature
and
consisting
of
details
are
devolved
on
the
secretary
of
state
which
do
not
appropriately
belong
to
the
foreign
department
of
the
government
and
may
properly
be
transferred
to
some
other
department
one
of
these
grows
out
of
the
present
state
of
the
law
concerning
the
patent
office
which
a
few
years
since
was
a
subordinate
clerkship
but
has
become
a
distinct
bureau
of
great
importance
with
an
excellent
internal
organization
it
is
still
connected
with
the
state
department
in
the
transaction
of
its
business
questions
of
much
importance
to
inventors
and
to
the
community
frequently
arise
which
by
existing
laws
are
referred
for
decision
to
a
board
of
which
the
secretary
of
state
is
a
member
these
questions
are
legal
and
the
connection
which
now
exists
between
the
state
department
and
the
patent
office
may
with
great
propriety
and
advantage
be
transferred
to
the
attorneygeneral
in
his
last
annual
message
to
congress
mr
madison
invited
attention
to
a
proper
provision
for
the
attorneygeneral
as
an
importan
t
improvement
in
the
executive
establishment
this
recommendation
was
repeated
by
some
of
his
successors
the
official
duties
of
the
attorneygeneral
have
been
much
increased
within
a
few
years
and
his
office
has
become
one
of
great
importance
his
duties
may
be
still
further
increased
with
advantage
to
the
public
interests
as
an
executive
officer
his
residence
and
constant
attention
at
the
seat
of
government
are
required
legal
questions
involving
important
principles
and
large
amounts
of
public
money
are
constantly
referred
to
him
by
the
president
and
executive
departments
for
his
examination
and
decision
the
public
business
under
his
official
management
before
the
judiciary
has
been
so
augmented
by
the
extension
of
our
territory
and
the
acts
of
congress
authorizing
suits
against
the
united
states
for
large
bodies
of
valuable
public
lands
as
greatly
to
increase
his
labors
and
responsibilities
i
therefore
recommend
that
the
attorneygeneral
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
with
the
heads
of
the
other
executive
departments
with
such
subordinate
officers
provided
by
law
for
his
department
as
may
be
required
to
discharge
the
additional
duties
which
have
been
or
may
be
devolved
upon
him
congress
possess
the
power
of
exclusive
legislation
over
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
commend
the
interests
of
its
inhabitants
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
people
of
this
district
have
no
legislative
body
of
their
own
and
must
confide
their
local
as
well
as
their
general
interests
to
representatives
in
whose
election
they
have
no
voice
and
over
whose
official
conduct
they
have
no
control
each
member
of
the
national
legislature
should
consider
himself
as
their
immediate
representative
and
should
be
the
more
ready
to
give
attention
to
their
interests
and
wants
because
he
is
not
responsible
to
them
i
recommend
that
a
liberal
and
generous
spirit
may
characterize
your
measures
in
relation
to
them
i
shall
be
ever
disposed
to
show
a
proper
regard
for
their
wishes
and
within
constitutional
limits
shall
at
all
times
cheerfully
cooperate
with
you
for
the
advancement
of
their
welfare
i
trust
it
may
not
be
deemed
inappropriate
to
the
occasion
for
me
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
memory
of
the
most
eminent
citizen
of
our
country
who
during
the
summer
that
is
gone
by
has
descended
to
the
tomb
the
enjoyment
of
contemplating
at
the
advanced
age
of
near
fourscore
years
the
happy
condition
of
his
country
cheered
the
last
hours
of
andrew
jackson
who
departed
this
life
in
the
tranquil
hope
of
a
blessed
immortality
his
death
was
happy
as
his
life
had
been
eminently
useful
he
had
an
unfaltering
confidence
in
the
virtue
and
capacity
of
the
people
and
in
the
permanence
of
that
free
government
which
he
had
largely
contributed
to
establish
and
defend
his
great
deeds
had
secured
to
him
the
affections
of
his
fellowcitizens
and
it
was
his
happiness
to
witness
the
growth
and
glory
of
his
country
which
he
loved
so
well
he
departed
amidst
the
benedictions
of
millions
of
freemen
the
nation
paid
its
tribute
to
his
memory
at
his
tomb
coming
generations
will
learn
from
his
example
the
love
of
country
and
the
rights
of
man
in
his
language
on
a
similar
occasion
to
the
present
i
now
commend
you
fellowcitizens
to
the
guidance
of
almighty
god
with
a
full
reliance
on
his
merciful
providence
for
the
maintenance
of
our
free
institutions
and
with
an
earnest
supplication
that
whatever
errors
it
may
be
my
lot
to
commit
in
discharging
the
arduous
duties
which
have
devolved
on
me
will
find
a
remedy
in
the
harmony
and
wisdom
of
your
counsels
james

fellowcitizens

our
devout
gratitude
is
due
to
the
supreme
being
for
having
graciously
continued
to
our
beloved
country
through
the
vicissitudes
of
another
year
the
invaluable
blessings
of
health
plenty
and
peace
seldom
has
this
favored
land
been
so
generally
exempted
from
the
ravages
of
disease
or
the
labor
of
the
husbandman
more
amply
rewarded
and
never
before
have
our
relations
with
other
countries
been
placed
on
a
more
favorable
basis
than
that
which
they
so
happily
occupy
at
this
critical
conjuncture
in
the
affairs
of
the
world
a
rigid
and
persevering
abstinence
from
all
interference
with
the
domestic
and
political
relations
of
other
states
alike
due
to
the
genius
and
distinctive
character
of
our
government
and
to
the
principles
by
which
it
is
directed
a
faithful
observance
in
the
management
of
our
foreign
relations
of
the
practice
of
speaking
plainly
dealing
justly
and
requiring
truth
and
justice
in
return
as
the
best
conservatives
of
the
peace
of

a
strict
impartiality
in
our
manifestations
of
friendship
in
the
commercial
privileges
we
concede
and
those
we
require
from
othersthese
accompanied
by
a
disposition
as
prompt
to
maintain
in
every
emergency
our
own
rights
as
we
are
from
principle
averse
to
the
invasion
of

the

family
of
nations
of
which
we
have
just
cause
to
be
proud
and
the
advantages
of
which
are
experienced
by
our
citizens
throughout
every

and
adventurous

remain

our
friendship
or
ignorant
of
the
terms
on
which
it
can
be
acquired
and
by
which
it
can
alone
be
preserved
a
series
of
questions
of
long
standing
difficult
in
their
adjustment
and
important
in
their
consequences
in
which
the
rights
of
our
citizens
and
the
honor
of
the
country
were
deeply
involved
have
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
the
most
of
them
during
the
successful
administration
of
my
immediate
predecessor
been
brought
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
and
the
most
important
of
those
remaining
are
i
am
happy
to
believe
in
a
fair
way
of
being
speedily
and
satisfactorily
adjusted
with
all
the
powers
of
the
world
our
relations
are
those
of
honorable
peace
since
your
adjournment
nothing
serious
has
occurred
to
interrupt
or
threaten
this
desirable
harmony
if
clouds
have
lowered
above
the
other
hemisphere
they
have
not
cast
their
portentous
shadows
upon
our
happy
shores
bound
by
no
entangling
alliances
yet
linked
by
a
common
nature
and
interest
with
the
other
nations
of
mankind
our
aspirations
are
for
the
preservation
of
peace
in
whose
solid
and
civilizing
triumphs
all
may
participate
with
a
generous
emulation
yet
it
behooves
us
to
be
prepared
for
any
event
and
to
be
always
ready
to
maintain
those
just
and
enlightened
principles
of
national
intercourse
for
which
this
government
has
ever
contended
in
the
shock
of
contending
empires
it
is
only
by
assuming
a
resolute
bearing
and
clothing
themselves
with
defensive
armor
that
neutral
nations
can
maintain
their
independent
rights
the
excitement
which
grew
out
of
the
territorial
controversy
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
having
in
a
great
measure
subsided
it
is
hoped
that
a
favorable
period
is
approaching
for
its
final
settlement
both
governments
must
now
be
convinced
of
the
dangers
with
which
the
question
is
fraught
and
it
must
be
their
desire
as
it
is
their
interest
that
this
perpetual
cause
of
irritation
should
be
removed
as
speedily
as
practicable
in
my
last
annual
message
you
were
informed
that
the
proposition
for
a
commission
of
exploration
and
survey
promised
by
great
britain
had
been
received
and
that
a
counter
project
including
also
a
provision
for
the
certain
and
final
adjustment
of
the
limits
in
dispute
was
then
before
the
british
government
for
its
consideration
the
answer
of
that
government
accompanied
by
additional
propositions
of
its
own
was
received
through
its
minister
here
since
your
separation
these
were
promptly
considered
such
as
were
deemed
correct
in
principle
and
consistent
with
a
due
regard
to
the
just
rights
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
maine
concurred
in
and
the
reasons
for
dissenting
from
the
residue
with
an
additional
suggestion
on
our
part
communicated
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
mr
fox
that
minister
not
feeling
himself
sufficiently
instructed
upon
some
of
the
points
raised
in
the
discussion
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
refer
the
matter
to
his
own
government
for
its
further
decision
having
now
been
for
some
time
under
its
advisement
a
speedy
answer
may
be
confidently
expected
from
the
character
of
the
points
still
in
difference
and
the
undoubted
disposition
of
both
parties
to
bring
the
matter
to
an
early
conclusion
i
look
with
entire
confidence
to
a
prompt
and
satisfactory
termination
of
the
negotiation
three
commissioners
were
appointed
shortly
after
the
adjournment
of
congress
under
the
act
of
the
last
session
providing
for
the
exploration
and
survey
of
the
line
which
separates
the
states
of
maine
and
new
hampshire
from
the
british
provinces
they
have
been
actively
employed
until
their
progress
was
interrupted
by
the
inclemency
of
the
season
and
will
resume
their
labors
as
soon
as
practicable
in
the
ensuing
year
it
is
understood
that
their
respective
examinations
will
throw
new
light
upon
the
subject
in
controversy
and
serve
to
remove
any
erroneous
impressions
which
may
have
been
made
elsewhere
prejudicial
to
the
rights
of
the
united
states
it
was
among
other
reasons
with
a
view
of
preventing
the
embarrassments
which
in
our
peculiar
system
of
government
impede
and
complicate
negotiations
involving
the
territorial
rights
of
a
state
that
i
thought
it
my
duty
as
you
have
been
informed
on
a
previous
occasion
to
propose
to
the
british
government
through
its
minister
at
washington
that
early
steps
should
be
taken
to
adjust
the
points
of
difference
on
the
line
of
boundary
from
the
entrance
of
lake
superior
to
the
most
northwestern
point
of
the
lake
of
the
woods
by
the
arbitration
of
a
friendly
power
in
conformity
with
the
seventh
article
of
the
treaty
of
ghent
no
answer
has
yet
been
returned
by
the
british
government
to
this
proposition
with
austria
france
prussia
russia
and
the
remaining
powers
of
europe
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
our
relations
continue
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
with
belgium
a
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
based
upon
liberal
principles
of
reciprocity
and
equality
was
concluded
in
march
last
and
having
been
ratified
by
the
belgian
government
will
be
duly
laid
before
the
senate
it
is
a
subject
of
congratulation
that
it
provides
for
the
satisfactory
adjustment
of
a
longstanding
question
of
controversy
thus
removing
the
only
obstacle
which
could
obstruct
the
friendly
and
mutually
advantageous
intercourse
between
the
two
nations
a
messenger
has
been
dispatched
with
the
hanoverian
treaty
to
berlin
where
according
to
stipulation
the
ratifications
are
to
be
exchanged
i
am
happy
to
announce
to
you
that
after
many
delays
and
difficulties
a
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
between
the
united
states
and
portugal
was
concluded
and
signed
at
lisbon
on
the
th
of
august
last
by
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
two
governments
its
stipulations
are
founded
upon
those
principles
of
mutual
liberality
and
advantage
which
the
united
states
have
always
sought
to
make
the
basis
of
their
intercourse
with
foreign
powers
and
it
is
hoped
they
will
tend
to
foster
and
strengthen
the
commercial
intercourse
of
the
two
countries
under
the
appropriation
of
the
last
session
of
congress
an
agent
has
been
sent
to
germany
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
interests
of
our
tobacco
trade
the
commissioners
appointed
under
the
convention
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
upon
mexico
having
met
and
organized
at
washington
in
august
last
the
papers
in
the
possession
of
the
government
relating
to
those
claims
were
communicated
to
the
board
the
claims
not
embraced
by
that
convention
are
now
the
subject
of
negotiation
between
the
two
governments
through
the
medium
of
our
minister
at
mexico
nothing
has
occurred
to
disturb
the
harmony
of
our
relations
with
the
different
governments
of
south
america
i
regret
however
to
be
obliged
to
inform
you
that
the
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
the
late
republic
of
colombia
have
not
yet
been
satisfied
by
the
separate
governments
into
which
it
has
been
resolved
the
charge
daffaires
of
brazil
having
expressed
the
intention
of
his
government
not
to
prolong
the
treaty
of
it
will
cease
to
be
obligatory
upon
either
party
on
the
th
day
of
december
when
the
extensive
commercial
intercourse
between
the
united
states
and
that
vast
empire
will
no
longer
be
regulated
by
express
stipulations
it
affords
me
pleasure
to
communicate
to
you
that
the
government
of
chili
has
entered
into
an
agreement
to
indemnify
the
claimants
in
the
case
of
the
macectonian
for
american
property
seized
in
and
to
add
that
information
has
also
been
received
which
justifies
the
hope
of
an
early
adjustment
of
the
remaining
claims
upon
that
government
the
commissioners
appointed
in
pursuance
of
the
convention
between
the
united
states
and
texas
for
marking
the
boundary
between
them
have
according
to
the
last
report
received
from
our
commissioner
surveyed
and
established
the
whole
extent
of
the
boundary
north
along
the
western
bank
of
the
sabine
river
from
its
entrance
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
thirtysecond
degree
of
north
latitude
the
commission
adjourned
on
the
th
of
june
last
to
reassemble
on
the
st
of
november
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
accurately
the
intersection
of
the
thirtysecond
degree
of
latitude
with
the
western
bank
of
the
sabine
and
the
meridian
line
thence
to
red
river
it
is
presumed
that
the
work
will
be
concluded
in
the
present
season
the
present
sound
condition
of
their
finances
and
the
success
with
which
embarrassments
in
regard
to
them
at
times
apparently
insurmountable
have
been
overcome
are

matters
upon
which
the
people
and
government
of
the
united
states
may
well
congratulate
themselves
an
overflowing
treasury
however
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
evidence
of
public
prosperity
is
seldom
conducive
to
the
permanent
welfare
of
any
people
and
experience
has
demonstrated
its
incompatibility
with
the
salutary
action
of
political
institutions
like
those
of
the
united
states
our
safest
reliance
for
financial
efficiency
and
independence
has
on
the
contrary
been
found
to
consist
in
ample
resources
unencumbered
with
debt
and
in
this
respect
the
federal
government
occupies
a
singularly
fortunate
and
truly
enviable
position
when
i
entered
upon
the
discharge
of
my
official
duties
in
march
the
act
for
the
distribution
of
the
surplus
revenue
was
in
a
course
of
rapid
execution
nearly
of
the
public
moneys
were
in
pursuance
of
its
provisions
deposited
with
the
states
in
the
months
of
january
april
and
july
of
that
year
in
may
there
occurred
a
general
suspension
of
specie
payments
by
the
banks
including
with
very
few
exceptions
those
in
which
the
public
moneys
were
deposited
and
upon
whose
fidelity
the
government
had
unfortunately
made
itself
dependent
for
the
revenues
which
had
been
collected
from
the
people
and
were
indispensable
to
the
public
service
this
suspension
and
the
excesses
in
banking
and
commerce
out
of
which
it
arose
and
which
were
greatly
aggravated
by
its
occurrence
made
to
a
great
extent
unavailable
the
principal
part
of
the
public
money
then
on
hand
suspended
the
collection
of
many
millions
accruing
on
merchants
bonds
and
greatly
reduced
the
revenue
arising
from
customs
and
the
public
lands
these
effects
have
continued
to
operate
in
various
degrees
to
the
present
period
and
in
addition
to
the
decrease
in
the
revenue
thus
produced
two
and
a
half
millions
of
duties
have
been
relinquished
by
two
biennial
reductions
under
the
act
of
and
probably
as
much
more
upon
the
importation
of
iron
for
railroads
by
special
legislation
whilst
such
has
been
our
condition
for
the
last
four
years
in
relation
to
revenue
we
have
during
the
same
period
been
subjected
to
an
unavoidable
continuance
of
large
extraordinary
expenses
necessarily
growing
out
of
past
transactions
and
which
could
not
be
immediately
arrested
without
great
prejudice
to
the
public
interest
of
these
the
charge
upon
the
treasurer
in
consequence
of
the
cherokee
treaty
alone
without
adverting
to
others
arising
out
of
indian
treaties
has
already
exceeded
that
for
the
prosecution
of
measures
for
the
removal
of
the
seminole
indians
which
were
found
in
progress
has
been
nearly
fourteen
millions
and
the
public
buildings
have
required
the
unusual
sum
of
nearly
three
millions
it
affords
me
however
great
pleasure
to
be
able
to
say
that
from
the
commencement
of
this
period
to
the
present
day
every
demand
upon
the
government
at
home
or
abroad
has
been
promptly
met
this
has
been
done
not
only
without
creating
a
permanent
debt
or
a
resort
to
additional
taxation
in
any
form
but
in
the
midst
of
a
steadily
progressive
reduction
of
existing
burdens
upon
the
people
leaving
still
a
considerable
balance
of
available
funds
which
will
remain
in
the
treasury
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
small
amount
of
treasury
notes
not
exceeding
still
outstanding
and
less
by
twentythree
millions
than
the
united
states
have
in
deposit
with
the
states
is
composed
of
such
only
as
are
not
yet
due
or
have
not
been
presented
for
payment
they
may
be
redeemed
out
of
the
accruing
revenue
if
the
expenditures
do
not
exceed
the
amount
within
which
they
may
it
is
thought
be
kept
without
prejudice
to
the
public
interest
and
the
revenue
shall
prove
to
be
as
large
as
may
justly
be
anticipated
among
the
reflections
arising
from
the
contemplation
of
these
circumstances
one
not
the
least
gratifying
is
the
consciousness
that
the
government
had
the
resolution
and
the
ability
to
adhere
in
every
emergency
to
the
sacred
obligations
of
law
to
execute
all
its
contracts
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
and
thus
to
present
when
most
needed
a
rallying
point
by
which
the
business
of
the
whole
country
might
be
brought
back
to
a
safe
and
unvarying
standarda
result
vitally
important
as
well
to
the
interests
as
to
the
morals
of
the
people
there
can
surely
now
be
no
difference
of
opinion
in
regard
to
the
incalculable
evils
that
would
have
arisen
if
the
government
at
that
critical
moment
had
suffered
itself
to
be
deterred
from
upholding
the
only
true
standard
of
value
either
by
the
pressure
of
adverse
circumstances
or
the
violence
of
unmerited
denunciation
the
manner
in
which
the
people
sustained
the
performance
of
this
duty
was
highly
honorable
to
their
fortitude
and
patriotism
it
can
not
fail
to
stimulate
their
agents
to
adhere
under
all
circumstances
to
the
line
of
duty
and
to
satisfy
them
of
the
safety
with
which
a
course
really
right
and
demanded
by
a
financial
crisis
may
in
a
community
like
ours
be
pursued
however
apparently
severe
its
immediate
operation
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
in
extinguishing
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
national
debt
and
subsequently
in
resisting
every
temptation
to
create
a
new
one
deserves
to
be
regarded
in
the
same
favorable
light
among
the
many
objections
to
a
national
debt
the
certain
tendency
of
public
securities
to
concentrate
ultimately
in
the
coffers
of
foreign
stockholders
is
one
which
is
every
day
gathering
strength
already
have
the
resources
of
many
of
the
states
and
the
future
industry
of
their
citizens
been
indefinitely
mortgaged
to
the
subjects
of
european
governments
to
the
amount
of
twelve
millions
annually
to
pay
the
constantly
accruing
interest
on
borrowed
moneya
sum
exceeding
half
the
ordinary
revenues
of
the
whole
united
states
the
pretext
which
this
relation
affords
to
foreigners
to
scrutinize
the
management
of
our
domestic
affairs
if
not
actually
to
intermeddle
with
them
presents
a
subject
for
earnest
attention
not
to
say
of
serious
alarm
fortunately
the
federal
government
with
the
exception
of
an
obligation
entered
into
in
behalf
of
the
district
of
columbia
which
must
soon
be
discharged
is
wholly
exempt
from
any
such
embarrassment
it
is
also
as
is
believed
the
only
government
which
having
fully
and
faithfully
paid
all
its
creditors
has
also
relieved
itself
entirely
from
debt
to
maintain
a
distinction
so
desirable
and
so
honorable
to
our
national
character
should
be
an
object
of
earnest
solicitude
never
should
a
free
people
if
it
be
possible
to
avoid
it
expose
themselves
to
the
necessity
of
having
to
treat
of
the
peace
the
honor
or
the
safety
of
the
republic
with
the
governments
of
foreign
creditors
who
however
well
disposed
they
may
be
to
cultivate
with
us
in
general
friendly
relations
are
nevertheless
by
the
law
of
their
own
condition
made
hostile
to
the
success
and
permanency
of
political
institutions
like
ours
most
humiliating
may
be
the
embarrassments
consequent
upon
such
a
condition
another
objection
scarcely
less
formidable
to
the
commencement
of
a
new
debt
is
its
inevitable
tendency
to
increase
in
magnitude
and
to
foster
national
extravagance
he
has
been
an
unprofitable
observer
of
events
who
needs
at
this
day
to
be
admonished
of
the
difficulties
which
a
government
habitually
dependent
on
loans
to
sustain
its
ordinary
expenditures
has
to
encounter
in
resisting
the
influences
constantly
exerted
in
favor
of
additional
loans
by
capitalists
who
enrich
themselves
by
government
securities
for
amounts
much
exceeding
the
money
they
actually
advancea
prolific
source
of
individual
aggrandizement
in
all
borrowing
countries
by
stockholders
who
seek
their
gains
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
public
stocks
and
by
the
selfish
importunities
of
applicants
for
appropriations
for
works
avowedly
for
the
accommodation
of
the
public
but
the
real
objects
of
which
are
too
frequently
the
advancement
of
private
interests
the
known
necessity
which
so
many
of
the
states
will
be
under
to
impose
taxes
for
the
payment
of
the
interest
on
their
debts
furnishes
an
additional
and
very
cogent
reason
why
the
federal
governments
should
refrain
from
creating
a
national
debt
by
which
the
people
would
be
exposed
to
double
taxation
for
a
similar
object
we
possess
within
ourselves
ample
resources
for
every
emergency
and
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
our
citizens
in
no
future
exigency
will
be
unwilling
to
supply
the
government
with
all
the
means
asked
for
the
defense
of
the
country
in
time
of
peace
there
can
at
all
events
be
no
justification
for
the
creation
of
a
permanent
debt
by
the
federal
government
its
limited
range
of
constitutional
duties
may
certainly
under
such
circumstances
be
performed
without
such
a
resort
it
has
it
is
seen
been
avoided
during
four
years
of
greater
fiscal
difficulties
than
have
existed
in
a
similar
period
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
one
also
remarkable
for
the
occurrence
of
extraordinary
causes
of
expenditures
but
to
accomplish
so
desirable
an
object
two
things
are
indispensable
first
that
the
action
of
the
federal
government
be
kept
within
the
boundaries
prescribed
by
its
founders
and
secondly
that
all
appropriations
for
objects
admitted
to
be
constitutional
and
the
expenditure
of
them
also
be
subjected
to
a
standard
of
rigid
but
wellconsidered
and
practical
economy
the
first
depends
chiefly
on
the
people
themselvesthe
opinions
they
form
of
the
true
construction
of
the
constitution
and
the
confidence
they
repose
in
the
political
sentiments
of
those
they
select
as
their
representatives
in
the
federal
legislature
the
second
rests
upon
the
fidelity
with
which
their
more
immediate
representatives
and
other
public
functionaries
discharge
the
trusts
committed
to
them
the
duty
of
economizing
the
expenses
of
the
public
service
is
admitted
on
all
hands
yet
there
are
few
subjects
upon
which
there
exists
a
wider
difference
of
opinion
than
is
constantly
manifested
in
regard
to
the
fidelity
with
which
that
duty
is
discharged
neither
diversity
of
sentiment
nor
even
mutual
recriminations
upon
a
point
in
respect
to
which
the
public
mind
is
so
justly
sensitive
can
well

be
entirely
avoided
and
least
so
at
periods
of
great
political
excitement
an
intelligent
people
however
seldom
fail
to
arrive
in
the
end
at
correct
conclusions
in
such
a
matter
practical
economy
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
can
have
no
adverse
influence
to
contend
with
more
powerful
than
a
large
surplus
revenue
and
the
unusually
large
appropriations
for
may
without
doubt
independently
of
the
extraordinary
requisitions
for
the
public
service
growing
out
of
the
state
of
our
indian
relations
be
in
no
inconsiderable
degree
traced
to
this
source
the
sudden
and
rapid
distribution
of
the
large
surplus
then
in
the
treasury
and
the
equally
sudden
and
unprecedentedly
severe
revulsion
in
the
commerce
and
business
of
the
country
pointing
with
unerring
certainty
to
a
great
and
protracted
reduction
of
the
revenue
strengthened
the
propriety
of
the
earliest
practicable
reduction
of
the
public
expenditures
but
to
change
a
system
operating
upon
so
large
a
surface
and
applicable
to
such
numerous
and
diversified
interests
and
objects
was
more
than
the
work
of
a
day
the
attention
of
every
department
of
the
government
was
immediately
and
in
good
faith
directed
to
that
end
and
has
been
so
continued
to
the
present
moment
the
estimates
and
appropriations
for
the
year
the
first
over
which
i
had
any
control
were
somewhat
diminished
the
expenditures
of
were
reduced
those
of
exclusive
of
disbursements
for
public
debt
and
trust
claims
will
probably
not
exceed
twentytwo
and
a
half
millions
being
between
two
and
three
millions
less
than
those
of
the
preceding
year
and
nine
or
ten
millions
less
than
those
of
nor
has
it
been
found
necessary
in
order
to
produce
this
result
to
resort
to
the
power
conferred
by
congress
of
postponing
certain
classes
of
the
public
works
except
by
deferring
expenditures
for
a
short
period
upon
a
limited
portion
of
them
and
which
postponement
terminated
some
time
sinceat
the
moment
the
treasury
department
by
further
receipts
from
the
indebted
banks
became
fully
assured
of
its
ability
to
meet
them
without
prejudice
to
the
public
service
in
other
respects
causes
are
in
operation
which
will
it
is
believed
justify
a
still
further
reduction
without
injury
to
any
important
national
interest
the
expenses
of
sustaining
the
troops
employed
in
florida
have
been
gradually
and
greatly
reduced
through
the
persevering
efforts
of
the
war
department
and
a
reasonable
hope
may
be
entertained
that
the
necessity
for
military
operations
in
that
quarter
will
soon
cease
the
removal
of
the
indians
from
within
our
settled
borders
is
nearly
completed
the
pension
list
one
of
the
heaviest
charges
upon
the
treasury
is
rapidly
diminishing
by
death
the
most
costly
of
our
public
buildings
are
either
finished
or
nearly
so
and
we
may
i
think
safely
promise
ourselves
a
continued
exemption
from
border
difficulties
the
available
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
january
next
is
estimated
at
this
sum
with
the
expected
receipts
from
all
sources
during
the
next
year
will
it
is
believed
be
sufficient
to
enable
the
government
to
meet
every
engagement
and
have
a
suitable
balance
in
the
treasury
at
the
end
of
the
year
if
the
remedial
measures
connected
with
the
customs
and
the
public
lands
heretofore
recommended
are
adopted
and
the
new
appropriations
by
congress
shall
not
carry
the
expenditures
beyond
the
official
estimates
the
new
system
established
by
congress
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
money
prescribing
the
kind
of
currency
to
be
received
for
the
public
revenue
and
providing
additional
guards
and
securities
against
losses
has
now
been
several
mouths
in
operation
although
it
might
be
premature
upon
an
experience
of
such
limited
duration
to
form
a
definite
opinion
in
regard
to
the
extent
of
its
influences
in
correcting
many
evils
under
which
the
federal
government
and
the
country
have
hitherto
suffered
especially
those
that
have
grown
out
of
banking
expansions
a
depreciated
currency
and
official
defalcations
yet
it
is
but
right
to
say
that
nothing
has
occurred
in
the
practical
operation
of
the
system
to
weaken
in
the
slightest
degree
but
much
to
strengthen
the
confident
anticipations
of
its
friends
the
grounds
of
these
have
been
heretofore
so
fully
explained
as
to
require
no
recapitulation
in
respect
to
the
facility
and
convenience
it
affords
in
conducting
the
public
service
and
the
ability
of
the
government
to
discharge
through
its
agency
every
duty
attendant
on
the
collection
transfer
and
disbursement
of
the
public
money
with
promptitude
and
success
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
the
apprehensions
of
those
who
felt
it
to
be
their
duty
to
oppose
its
adoption
have
proved
to
be
unfounded
on
the
contrary
this
branch
of
the
fiscal
affairs
of
the
government
has
been
and
it
is
believed
may
always
be
thus
carried
on
with
every
desirable
facility
and
security
a
few
changes
and
improvements
in
the
details
of
the
system
without
affecting
any
principles
involved
in
it
will
be
submitted
to
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
will
i
am
sure
receive
at
your
hands
that
attention
to
which
they
may
on
examination
be
found
to
be
entitled
i
have
deemed
this
brief
summary
of
our
fiscal
affairs
necessary
to
the
due
performance
of
a
duty
specially
enjoined
upon
me
by
the
constitution
it
will
serve
also
to
illustrate
more
fully
the
principles
by
which
i
have
been
guided
in
reference
to
two
contested
points
in
our
public
policy
which
were
earliest
in
their
development
and
have
been
more
important
in
their
consequences
than
any
that
have
arisen
under
our
complicated
and
difficult
yet
admirable
system
of
government
i
allude
to
a
national
debt
and
a
national
bank
it
was
in
these
that
the
political
contests
by
which
the
country
has
been
agitated
ever
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
a
great
measure
originated
and
there
is
too
much
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
conflicting
interests
and
opposing
principles
thus
marshaled
will
continue
as
heretofore
to
produce
similar
if
not
aggravated
consequences
coming
into
office
the
declared
enemy
of
both
i
have
earnestly
endeavored
to
prevent
a
resort
to
either
the
consideration
that
a
large
public
debt
affords
an
apology
and
produces
in
some
degree
a
necessity
also
for
resorting
to
a
system
and
extent
of
taxation
which
is
not
only
oppressive
throughout
but
is
likewise
so
apt
to
lead
in
the
end
to
the
commission
of
that
most
odious
of
all
offenses
against
the
principles
of
republican
government
the
prostitution
of
political
power
conferred
for
the
general
benefit
to
the
aggrandizement
of
particular
classes
and
the
gratification
of
individual
cupidity
is
alone
sufficient
independently
of
the
weighty
objections
which
have
already
been
urged
to
render
its
creation
and
existence
the
sources
of
bitter
and
unappeasable
discord
if
we
add
to
this
its
inevitable
tendency
to
produce
and
foster
extravagant
expenditures
of
the
public
moneys
by
which
a
necessity
is
created
for
new
loans
and
new
burdens
on
the
people
and
finally
refer
to
the
examples
of
every
government
which
has
existed
for
proof
how
seldom
it
is
that
the
system
when
once
adopted
and
implanted
in
the
policy
of
a
country
has
failed
to
expand
itself
until
public
credit
was
exhausted
and
the
people
were
no
longer
able
to
endure
its
increasing
weight
it
seems
impossible
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
no
benefits
resulting
from
its
career
no
extent
of
conquest
no
accession
of
wealth
to
particular
classes
nor
any
nor
all
its
combined
advantages
can
counterbalance
its
ultimate
but
certain
resultsa
splendid
government
and
an
impoverished
people
if
a
national
bank
was
as
is
undeniable
repudiated
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
as
incompatible
with
the
rights
of
the
states
and
the
liberties
of
the
people
if
from
the
beginning
it
has
been
regarded
by
large
portions
of
our
citizens
as
coming
in
direct
collision
with
that
great
and
vital
amendment
of
the
constitution
which
declares
that
all
powers
not
conferred
by
that
instrument
on
the
general
government
are
reserved
to
the
states
and
to
the
people
if
it
has
been
viewed
by
them
as
the
first
great
step
in
the
march
of
latitudinous
construction
which
unchecked
would
render
that
sacred
instrument
of
as
little
value
as
an
unwritten
constitution
dependent
as
it
would
alone
be
for
its
meaning
on
the
interested
interpretation
of
a
dominant
party
and
affording
no
security
to
the
rights
of
the
minorityif
such
is
undeniably
the
case
what
rational
grounds
could
have
been
conceived
for
anticipating
aught
but
determined
opposition
to
such
an
institution
at
the
present
day
could
a
different
result
have
been
expected
when
the
consequences
which
have
flowed
from
its
creation
and
particularly
from
its
struggles
to
perpetuate
its
existence
had
confirmed
in
so
striking
a
manner
the
apprehensions
of
its
earliest
opponents
when
it
had
been
so
clearly
demonstrated
that
a
concentrated
money
power
wielding
so
vast
a
capital
and
combining
such
incalculable
means
of
influence
may
in
those
peculiar
conjunctures
to
which
this
government
is
unavoidably
exposed
prove
an
overmatch
for
the
political
power
of
the
people
themselves
when
the
true
character
of
its
capacity
to
regulate
according
to
its
will
and
its
interests
and
the
interests
of
its
favorites
the
value
and
production
of
the
labor
and
property
of
every
man
in
this
extended
country
had
been
so
fully
and
fearfully
developed
when
it
was
notorious
that
all
classes
of
this
great
community
had
by
means
of
the
power
and
influence
it
thus
possesses
been
infected
to
madness
with
a
spirit
of
heedless
speculation
when
it
had
been
seen
that
secure
in
the
support
of
the
combination
of
influences
by
which
it
was
surrounded
it
could
violate
its
charter
and
set
the
laws
at
defiance
with
impunity
and
when
too
it
had
become
most
apparent
that
to
believe
that
such
an
accumulation
of
powers
can
ever
be
granted
without
the
certainty
of
being
abused
was
to
indulge
in
a
fatal
delusion
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
a
permanent
debt
and
its
inevitable
consequences
i
have
advocated
and
endeavored
to
carry
into
effect
the
p
olicy
of
confining
the
appropriations
for
the
public
service
to
such
objects
only
as
are
clearly
within
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
federal
government
of
excluding
from
its
expenses
those
improvident
and
unauthorized
grants
of
public
money
for
works
of
internal
improvement
which
were
so
wisely
arrested
by
the
constitutional
interposition
of
my
predecessor
and
which
if
they
had
not
been
so
checked
would
long
before
this
time
have
involved
the
finances
of
the
general
government
in
embarrassments
far
greater
than
those
which
are
now
experienced
by
any
of
the
states
of
limiting
all
our
expenditures
to
that
simple
unostentatious
and
economical
administration
of
public
affairs
which
is
alone
consistent
with
the
character
of
our
institutions
of
collecting
annually
from
the
customs
and
the
sales
of
public
lands
a
revenue
fully
adequate
to
defray
all
the
expenses
thus
incurred
but
under
no
pretense
whatsoever
to
impose
taxes
upon
the
people
to
a
greater
amount
than
was
actually
necessary
to
the
public
service
conducted
upon
the
principles
i
have
stated
in
lieu
of
a
national
bank
or
a
dependence
upon
banks
of
any
description
for
the
management
of
our
fiscal
affairs
i
recommended
the
adoption
of
the
system
which
is
now
in
successful
operation
that
system
affords
every
requisite
facility
for
the
transaction
of
the
pecuniary
concerns
of
the
government
will
it
is
confidently
anticipated
produce
in
other
respects
many
of
the
benefits
which
have
been
from
time
to
time
expected
from
the
creation
of
a
national
bank
but
which
have
never
been
realized
avoid
the
manifold
evils
inseparable
from
such
an
institution
diminish
to
a
greater
extent
than
could
be
accomplished
by
any
other
measure
of
reform
the
patronage
of
the
federal
governmenta
wise
policy
in
all
governments
but
more
especially
so
in
one
like
ours
which
works
well
only
in
proportion
as
it
is
made
to
rely
for
its
support
upon
the
unbiased
and
unadulterated
opinions
of
its
constituents
do
away
forever
all
dependence
on
corporate
bodies
either
in
the
raising
collecting
safekeeping
or
disbursing
the
public
revenues
and
place
the
government
equally
above
the
temptation
of
fostering
a
dangerous
and
unconstitutional
institution
at
home
or
the
necessity
of
adapting
its
policy
to
the
views
and
interests
of
a
still
more
formidable
money
power
abroad
it
is
by
adopting
and
carrying
out
these
principles
under
circumstances
the
most
arduous
and
discouraging
that
the
attempt
has
been
made
thus
far
successfully
to
demonstrate
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
a
national
bank
at
all
times
and
a
national
debt
except
it
be
incurred
at
a
period
when
the
honor
and
safety
of
the
nation
demand
the
temporary
sacrifice
of
a
policy
which
should
only
be
abandoned
in
such
exigencies
are
not
merely
unnecessary
but
in
direct
and
deadly
hostility
to
the
principles
of
their
government
and
to
their
own
permanent
welfare
the
progress
made
in
the
development
of
these
positions
appears
in
the
preceding
sketch
of
the
past
history
and
present
state
of
the
financial
concerns
of
the
federal
government
the
facts
there
stated
fully
authorize
the
assertion
that
all
the
purposes
for
which
this
government
was
instituted
have
been
accomplished
during
four
years
of
greater
pecuniary
embarrassment
than
were
ever
before
experienced
in
time
of
peace
and
in
the
face
of
opposition
as
formidable
as
any
that
was
ever
before
arrayed
against
the
policy
of
an
administration
that
this
has
been
done
when
the
ordinary
revenues
of
the
government
were
generally
decreasing
as
well
from
the
operation
of
the
laws
as
the
condition
of
the
country
without
the
creation
of
a
permanent
public
debt
or
incurring
any
liability
other
than
such
as
the
ordinary
resources
of
the
government
will
speedily
discharge
and
without
the
agency
of
a
national
bank
if
this
view
of
the
proceedings
of
the
government
for
the
period
it
embraces
be
warranted
by
the
facts
as
they
are
known
to
exist
if
the
army
and
navy
have
been
sustained
to
the
full
extent
authorized
by
law
and
which
congress
deemed
sufficient
for
the
defense
of
the
country
and
the
protection
of
its
rights
and
its
honor
if
its
civil
and
diplomatic
service
has
been
equally
sustained
if
ample
provision
has
been
made
for
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
execution
of
the
laws
if
the
claims
upon
public
gratitude
in
behalf
of
the
soldiers
of
the
revolution
have
been
promptly
met
and
faithfully
discharged
if
there
have
been
no
failures
in
defraying
the
very
large
expenditures
growing
out
of
that
longcontinued
and
salutary
policy
of
peacefully
removing
the
indians
to
regions
of
comparative
safety
and
prosperity
if
the
public
faith
has
at
all
times
and
everywhere
been
most
scrupulously
maintained
by
a
prompt
discharge
of
the
numerous
extended
and
diversified
claims
on
the
treasuryif
all
these
great
and
permanent
objects
with
many
others
that
might
be
stated
have
for
a
series
of
years
marked
by
peculiar
obstacles
and
difficulties
been
successfully
accomplished
without
a
resort
to
a
permanent
debt
or
the
aid
of
a
national
bank
have
we
not
a
right
to
expect
that
a
policy
the
object
of
which
has
been
to
sustain
the
public
service
independently
of
either
of
these
fruitful
sources
of
discord
will
receive
the
final
sanction
of
a
people
whose
unbiased
and
fairly
elicited
judgment
upon
public
affairs
is
never
ultimately
wrong
that
embarrassments
in
the
pecuniary
concerns
of
individuals
of
unexampled
extent
and
duration
have
recently
existed
in
this
as
in
other
commercial
nations
is
undoubtedly
true
to
suppose
it
necessary
now
to
trace
these
reverses
to
their
sources
would
be
a
reflection
on
the
intelligence
of
my
fellowcitizens
whatever
may
have
been
the
obscurity
in
which
the
subject
was
involved
during
the
earlier
stages
of
the
revulsion
there
can
not
now
be
many
by
whom
the
whole
question
is
not
fully
understood
not
deeming
it
within
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
general
government
to
repair
private
losses
sustained
by
reverses
in
business
having
no
connection
with
the
public
service
either
by
direct
appropriations
from
the
treasury
or
by
special
legislation
designed
to
secure
exclusive
privileges
and
immunities
to
individuals
or
classes
in
preference
to
or
at
the
expense
of
the
great
majority
necessarily
debarred
from
any
participation
in
them
no
attempt
to
do
so
has
been
either
made
recommended
or
encouraged
by
the
present
executive
it
is
believed
however
that
the
great
purposes
for
the
attainment
of
which
the
federal
government
was
instituted
have
not
been
lost
sight
of
intrusted
only
with
certain
limited
powers
cautiously
enumerated
distinctly
specified
and
defined
with
a
precision
and
clearness
which
would
seem
to
defy
misconstruction
it
has
been
my
constant
aim
to
confine
myself
within
the
limits
so
clearly
marked
out
and
so
carefully
guarded
having
always
been
of
opinion
that
the
best
preservative
of
the
union
of
the
states
is
to
be
found
in
a
total
abstinence
from
the
exercise
of
all
doubtful
powers
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
rather
than
in
attempts
to
assume
them
by
a
loose
construction
of
the
constitution
or
an
ingenious
perversion
of
its
words
i
have
endeavored
to
avoid
recommending
any
measure
which
i
had
reason
to
apprehend
would
in
the
opinion
even
of
a
considerable
minority
of
my
fellowcitizens
be
regarded
as
trenching
on
the
rights
of
the
states
or
the
provisions
of
the
hallowed
instrument
of
our
union
viewing
the
aggregate
powers
of
the
federal
government
as
a
voluntary
concession
of
the
states
it
seemed
to
me
that
such
only
should
be
exercised
as
were
at
the
time
intended
to
be
given
i
have
been
strengthened
too
in
the
propriety
of
this
course
by
the
conviction
that
all
efforts
to
go
beyond
this
tend
only
to
produce
dissatisfaction
and
distrust
to
excite
jealousies
and
to
provoke
resistance
instead
of
adding
strength
to
the
federal
government
even
when
successful
they
must
ever
prove
a
source
of
incurable
weakness
by
alienating
a
portion
of
those
whose
adhesion
is
indispensable
to
the
great
aggregate
of
united
strength
and
whose
voluntary
attachment
is
in
my
estimation
far
more
essential
to
the
efficiency
of
a
government
strong
in
the
best
of
all
possible
strengththe
confidence
and
attachment
of
all
those
who
make
up
its
constituent
elements
thus
believing
it
has
been
my
purpose
to
secure
to
the
whole
people
and
to
every
member
of
the
confederacy
by
general
salutary
and
equal
laws
alone
the
benefit
of
those
republican
institutions
which
it
was
the
end
and
aim
of
the
constitution
to
establish
and
the
impartial
influence
of
which
is
in
my
judgment
indispensable
to
their
preservation
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
the
lasting
happiness
of
the
people
the
prosperity
of
the
states
or
the
permanency
of
their
union
can
be
maintained
by
giving
preference
or
priority
to
any
class
of
citizens
in
the
distribution
of
benefits
or
privileges
or
by
the
adoption
of
measures
which
enrich
one
portion
of
the
union
at
the
expense
of
another
nor
can
i
see
in
the
interference
of
the
federal
government
with
the
local
legislation
and
reserved
rights
of
the
states
a
remedy
for
present
or
a
security
against
future
dangers
the
first
and
assuredly
not
the
least
important
step
toward
relieving
the
country
from
the
condition
into
which
it
had
been
plunged
by
excesses
in
trade
banking
and
credits
of
all
kinds
was
to
place
the
business
transactions
of
the
government
itself
on
a
solid
basis
giving
and
receiving
in
all
cases
value
for
value
and
neither
countenancing
nor
encouraging
in
others
that
delusive
system
of
credits
from
which
it
has
been
found
so
difficult
to
escape
and
which
has
left
nothing
behind
it
but
the
wrecks
that
mark
its
fatal
career
that
the
financial
affairs
of
the
government
are
now
and
have
been
during
the
whole
period
of
these
widespreading
difficulties
conducted
with
a
strict
and
invariable
regard
to
this
great
fundamental
principle
and
that
by
the
assumption
and
maintenance
of
the
stand
thus
taken
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
approaching
crisis
more
than
by
an
y
other
cause
or
causes
whatever
the
community
at
large
has
been
shielded
from
the
incalculable
evils
of
a
general
and
indefinite
suspension
of
specie
payments
and
a
consequent
annihilation
for
the
whole
period
it
might
have
lasted
of
a
just
and
invariable
standard
of
value
will
it
is
believed
at
this
period
scarcely
be
questioned
a
steady
adherence
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
the
policy
which
has
produced
such
salutary
results
aided
by
judicious
state
legislation
and
what
is
not
less
important
by
the
industry
enterprise
perseverance
and
economy
of
the
american
people
can
not
fail
to
raise
the
whole
country
at
an
early
period
to
a
state
of
solid
and
enduring
prosperity
not
subject
to
be
again
overthrown
by
the
suspension
of
banks
or
the
explosion
of
a
bloated
credit
system
it
is
for
the
people
and
their
representatives
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
permanent
welfare
of
the
country
which
all
good
citizens
equally
desire
however
widely
they
may
differ
as
to
the
means
of
its
accomplishment
shall
be
in
this
way
secured
or
whether
the
management
of
the
pecuniary
concerns
of
the
government
and
by
consequence
to
a
great
extent
those
of
individuals
also
shall
be
carried
back
to
a
condition
of
things
which
fostered
those
contractions
and
expansions
of
the
currency
and
those
reckless
abuses
of
credit
from
the
baleful
effects
of
which
the
country
has
so
deeply
suffereda
return
that
can
promise
in
the
end
no
better
results
than
to
reproduce
the
embarrassments
the
government
has
experienced
and
to
remove
from
the
shoulders
of
the
present
to
those
of
fresh
victims
the
bitter
fruits
of
that
spirit
of
speculative
enterprise
to
which
our
countrymen
are
so
liable
and
upon
which
the
lessons
of
experience
are
so
unavailing
the
choice
is
an
important
one
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
it
may
be
wisely
made
a
report
from
the
secretary
of
war
presenting
a
detailed
view
of
the
affairs
of
that
department
accompanies
this
communication
the
desultory
duties
connected
with
the
removal
of
the
indians
in
which
the
army
has
been
constantly
engaged
on
the
northern
and
western
frontiers
and
in
florida
have
rendered
it
impracticable
to
carry
into
full
effect
the
plan
recommended
by
the
secretary
for
improving
its
discipline
in
every
instance
where
the
regiments
have
been
concentrated
they
have
made
great
progress
and
the
best
results
may
be
anticipated
from
a
continuance
of
this
system
during
the
last
season
a
part
of
the
troops
have
been
employed
in
removing
indians
from
the
interior
to
the
territory
assigned
them
in
the
westa
duty
which
they
have
performed
efficiently
and
with
praiseworthy
humanityand
that
portion
of
them
which
has
been
stationed
in
florida
continued
active
operations
there
throughout
the
heats
of
summer
the
policy
of
the
united
states
in
regard
to
the
indians
of
which
a
succinct
account
is
given
in
my
message
of
and
of
the
wisdom
and
expediency
of
which
i
am
fully
satisfied
has
been
continued
in
active
operation
throughout
the
whole
period
of
my
administration
since
the
spring
of
more
than
indians
have
been
removed
to
their
new
homes
west
of
the
mississippi
and
i
am
happy
to
add
that
all
accounts
concur
in
representing
the
result
of
this
measure
as
eminently
beneficial
to
that
people
the
emigration
of
the
seminoles
alone
has
been
attended
with
serious
difficulty
and
occasioned
bloodshed
hostilities
having
been
commenced
by
the
indians
in
florida
under
the
apprehension
that
they
would
be
compelled
by
force
to
comply
with
their
treaty
stipulations
the
execution
of
the
treaty
of
paynes
landing
signed
in
but
not
ratified
until
was
postponed
at
the
solicitation
of
the
indians
until
when
they
again
renewed
their
agreement
to
remove
peaceably
to
their
new
homes
in
the
west
in
the
face
of
this
solemn
and
renewed
compact
they
broke
their
faith
and
commenced
hostilities
by
the
massacre
of
major
dades
command
the
murder
of
their
agent
general
thompson
and
other
acts
of
cruel
treachery
when
this
alarming
and
unexpected
intelligence
reached
the
seat
of
government
every
effort
appears
to
have
been
made
to
reenforce
general
clinch
who
commanded
the
troops
then
in
florida
general
eustis
was
dispatched
with
reenforcements
from
charleston
troops
were
called
out
from
alabama
tennessee
and
georgia
and
general
scott
was
sent
to
take
the
command
with
ample
powers
and
ample
means
at
the
first
alarm
general
gaines
organized
a
force
at
new
orleans
and
without
waiting
for
orders
landed
in
florida
where
he
delivered
over
the
troops
he
had
brought
with
him
to
general
scott
governor
call
was
subsequently
appointed
to
conduct
a
summer
campaign
and
at
the
close
of
it
was
replaced
by
general
jesup
these
events
and
changes
took
place
under
the
administration
of
my
predecessor
notwithstanding
the
exertions
of
the
experienced
officers
who
had
command
there
for
eighteen
months
on
entering
upon
the
administration
of
the
government
i
found
the
territory
of
florida
a
prey
to
indian
atrocities
a
strenuous
effort
was
immediately
made
to
bring
those
hostilities
to
a
close
and
the
army
under
general
jesup
was
reenforced
until
it
amounted
to
men
and
furnished
with
abundant
supplies
of
every
description
in
this
campaign
a
great
number
of
the
enemy
were
captured
and
destroyed
but
the
character
of
the
contest
only
was
changed
the
indians
having
been
defeated
in
every
engagement
dispersed
in
small
bands
throughout
the
country
and
became
an
enterprising
formidable
and
ruthless
banditti
general
taylor
who
succeeded
general
jesup
used
his
best
exertions
to
subdue
them
and
was
seconded
in
his
efforts
by
the
officers
under
his
command
but
he
too
failed
to
protect
the
territory
from
their
depredations
by
an
act
of
signal
and
cruel
treachery
they
broke
the
truce
made
with
them
by
general
macgrab
who
was
sent
from
washington
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
into
effect
the
expressed
wishes
of
congress
and
have
continued
their
devastations
ever
since
general
armistead
who
was
in
florida
when
general
taylor
left
the
army
by
permission
assumed
the
command
and
after
active
summer
operations
was
met
by
propositions
for
peace
and
from
the
fortunate
coincidence
of
the
arrival
in
florida
at
the
same
period
of
a
delegation
from
the
seminoles
who
are
happily
settled
west
of
the
mississippi
and
are
now
anxious
to
persuade
their
countrymen
to
join
them
there
hopes
were
for
some
time
entertained
that
the
indians
might
be
induced
to
leave
the
territory
without
further
difficulty
these
hopes
have
proved
fallacious
and
hostilities
have
been
renewed
throughout
the
whole
of
the
territory
that
this
contest
has
endured
so
long
is
to
be
attributed
to
causes
beyond
the
control
of
the
government
experienced
generals
have
had
the
command
of
the
troops
officers
and
soldiers
have
alike
distinguished
themselves
for
their
activity
patience
and
enduring
courage
the
army
has
been
constantly
furnished
with
supplies
of
every
description
and
we
must
look
for
the
causes
which
have
so
long
procrastinated
the
issue
of
the
contest
in
the
vast
extent
of
the
theater
of
hostilities
the
almost
insurmountable
obstacles
presented
by
the
nature
of
the
country
the
climate
and
the
wily
character
of
the
savages
the
sites
for
marine
hospitals
on
the
rivers
and
lakes
which
i
was
authorized
to
select
and
cause
to
be
purchased
have
all
been
designated
but
the
appropriation
not
proving
sufficient
conditional
arrangements
only
have
been
made
for
their
acquisition
it
is
for
congress
to
decide
whether
these
conditional
purchases
shall
be
sanctioned
and
the
humane
intentions
of
the
law
carried
into
full
effect
the
navy
as
will
appear
from
the
accompanying
report
of
the

been
usefully
and
honorably
employed
in
the
protection
of

those
which

in
further
prosecution
of
objects
which
have
thus
far
been
successfully
accomplished
the
discovery
of
a
new
continent
which
was
first
seen
in
latitude
south
longitude
east
and
afterwards
in
latitude
south
longitude
east
by
lieutenants
wilkes
and
hudson
for
an
extent
of
miles
but
on
which
they
were
prevented
from
landing
by
vast
bodies
of
ice
which
encompassed
it
is
one
of
the
honorable
results
of
the
enterprise
lieutenant
wilkes
bears
testimony
to
the
zeal
and
good
conduct
of
his
officers
and
men
and
it
is
but
justice
to
that
officer
to
state
that
he
appears
to
have
performed
the
duties
assigned
him
with
an
ardor
ability
and
perseverance
which
give
every
assurance
of
an
honorable
issue
to
the
undertaking
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
herewith
transmitted

exhibit
the
service
of
that
department
the
past
year
and
its
present
condition
the
transportation
has
been
maintained
during
the
year
to
the
full
extent
authorized
by
the
existing
laws
some
improvements
have
been
effected
which
the
public
interest
seemed
urgently
to
demand
but
not
involving
any
material
additional
expenditure
the
contractors
have
generally
performed
their
engagements
with
fidelity
the
postmasters
with
few
exceptions
have
rendered
their
accounts
and
paid
their
quarterly
balances
with
promptitude
and
the
whole
service
of
the
department
has
maintained
the
efficiency
for
which
it
has
for
several
years
be
en
distinguished
the
acts
of
congress
establishing
new
mail
routes
and
requiring
more
expensive
services
on
others
and
the
increasing
wants
of
the
country
have
for
three
years
past
carried
the
expenditures
something
beyond
the
accruing
revenues
the
excess
having
been
met
until
the
past
year
by
the
surplus
which
had
previously
accumulated
that
surplus
having
been
exhausted
and
the
anticipated
increase
in
the
revenue
not
having
been
realized
owing
to
the
depression
in
the
commercial
business
of
the
country
the
finances
of
the
department
exhibit
a
small
deficiency
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
its
resources
however
are
ample
and
the
reduced
rates
of
compensation
for
the
transportation
service
which
may
be
expected
on
the
future
lettings
from
the
general
reduction
of
prices
with
the
increase
of
revenue
that
may
reasonably
be
anticipated
from
the
revival
of
commercial
activity
must
soon
place
the
finances
of
the
department
in
a
prosperous
condition
considering
the
unfavorable
circumstances
which
have
existed
during
the
past
year
it
is
a
gratifying
result
that
the
revenue
has
not
declined
as
compared
with
the
preceding
year
but
on
the
contrary
exhibits
a
small
increase
the
circumstances
referred

having
had
no
other
effect
than
to
check
the
expected

will
be
seen
that

object
highly

the
subject
is
one
of
general
interest
to
the
community
and
is
respectfully
recommended
to
your
consideration
the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
has
received
the
continued
attention
of
the
government
the
brig
dolphin
and
schooner
grampus
have
been
employed
during
the
last
season
on
the
coast
of
africa
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
such
portions
of
that
trade
as
were
said
to
be
prosecuted
under
the
american
flag
after
cruising
off
those
parts
of
the
coast
most
usually
resorted
to
by
slavers
until
the
commencement
of
the
rainy
season
these
vessels
returned
to
the
united
states
for
supplies
and
have
since
been
dispatched
on
a
similar
service
from
the
reports
of
the
commanding
officers
it
appears
that
the
trade
is
now
principally
carried
on
under
portuguese
colors
and
they
express
the
opinion
that
the
apprehension
of
their
presence
on
the
slave
coast
has
in
a
great
degree
arrested
the
prostitution
of
the
american
flag
to
this
inhuman
purpose
it
is
hoped
that
by
continuing
to
maintain
this
force
in
that
quarter
and
by
the
exertions
of
the
officers
in
command
much
will
be
done
to
put
a
stop
to
whatever
portion
of
this
traffic
may
have
been
carried
on
under
the
american
flag
and
to
prevent
its
use
in
a
trade
which
while
it
violates
the
laws
is
equally
an
outrage
on
the
rights
of
others
and
the
feelings
of
humanity
the
efforts
of
the
several
governments
who
are
anxiously
seeking
to
suppress
this
traffic
must
however
be
directed
against
the
facilities
afforded
by
what
are
now
recognized
as
legitimate
commercial
pursuits
before
that
object
can
be
fully
accomplished
supplies
of
provisions
water
casks
merchandise
and
articles
connected
with
the
prosecution
of
the
slave
trade
are
it
is
understood
freely
carried
by
vessels
of
different
nations
to
the
slave
factories
and
the
effects
of
the
factors
are
transported
openly
from
one
slave
station
to
another
without
interruption
or
punishment
by
either
of
the
nations
to
which
they
belong
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
that
region
i
submit
to
your
judgments
whether
this
government
having
been
the
first
to
prohibit
by
adequate
penalties
the
slave
trade
the
first
to
declare
it
piracy
should
not
be
the
first
also
to
forbid
to
its
citizens
all
trade
with
the
slave
factories
on
the
coast
of
africa
giving
an
example
to
all
nations
in
this
respect
which
if
fairly
followed
can
not
fail
to
produce
the
most
effective
results
in
breaking
up
those
dens
of
iniquity

i
regret
that
i
can
not
on
this
occasion
congratulate
you
that
the
past
year
has
been
one
of
unalloyed
prosperity
the
ravages
of
fire
and
disease
have
painfully
afflicted
otherwise
flourishing
portions
of
our
country
and
serious
embarrassments
yet
derange
the
trade
of
many
of
our
cities
but
notwithstanding
these
adverse
circumstances
that
general
prosperity
which
has
been
heretofore
so
bountifully
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
author
of
all
good
still
continues
to
call
for
our
warmest
gratitude
especially
have
we
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
exuberant
harvests
which
have
lavishly
recompensed
welldirected
industry
and
given
to
it
that
sure
reward
which
is
vainly
sought
in
visionary
speculations
i
cannot
indeed
view
without
peculiar
satisfaction
the
evidences
afforded
by
the
past
season
of
the
benefits
that
spring
from
the
steady
devotion
of
the
husbandman
to
his
honorable
pursuit
no
means
of
individual
comfort
is
more
certain
and
no
source
of
national
prosperity
is
so
sure
nothing
can
compensate
a
people
for
a
dependence
upon
others
for
the
bread
they
eat
and
that
cheerful
abundance
on
which
the
happiness
of
everyone
so
much
depends
is
to
be
looked
for
nowhere
with
such
sure
reliance
as
in
the
industry
of
the
agriculturist
and
the
bounties
of
the
earth
with
foreign
countries
our
relations
exhibit
the
same
favorable
aspect
which
was
presented
in
my
last
annual
message
and
afford
continued
proof
of
the
wisdom
of
the
pacific
just
and
forbearing
policy
adopted
by
the
first
administration
of
the
federal
government
and
pursued
by
its
successors
the
extraordinary
powers
vested
in
me
by
an
act
of
congress
for
the
defense
of
the
country
in
an
emergency
considered
so
far
probable
as
to
require
that
the
executive
should
possess
ample
means
to
meet
it
have
not
been
exerted
they
have
therefore
been
attended
with
no
other
result
than
to
increase
by
the
confidence
thus
reposed
in
me
my
obligations
to
maintain
with
religious
exactness
the
cardinal
principles
that
govern
our
intercourse
with
other
nations
happily
in
our
pending
questions
with
great
britain
out
of
which
this
unusual
grant
of
authority
arose
nothing
has
occurred
to
require
its
exertion
and
as
it
is
about
to
return
to
the
legislature
i
trust
that
no
future
necessity
may
call
for
its
exercise
by
them
or
its
delegation
to
another
department
of
the
government
for
the
settlement
of
our
northeastern
boundary
the
proposition
promised
by
great
britain
for
a
commission
of
exploration
and
survey
has
been
received
and
a
counter
project
including
also
a
provision
for
the
certain
and
final
adjustment
of
the
limits
in
dispute
is
now
before
the
british
government
for
its
consideration
a
just
regard
to
the
delicate
state
of
this
question
and
a
proper
respect
for
the
natural
impatience
of
the
state
of
maine
not
less
than
a
conviction
that
the
negotiation
has
been
already
protracted
longer
than
is
prudent
on
the
part
of
either
government
have
led
me
to
believe
that
the
present
favorable
moment
should
on
no
account
be
suffered
to
pass
without
putting
the
question
forever
at
rest
i
feel
confident
that
the
government
of
her
britannic
majesty
will
take
the
same
view
of
this
subject
as
i
am
persuaded
it
is
governed
by
desires
equally
strong
and
sincere
for
the
amicable
termination
of
the
controversy
to
the
intrinsic
difficulties
of
questions
of
boundary
lines
especially
those
described
in
regions
unoccupied
and
but
partially
known
is
to
be
added
in
our
country
the
embarrassment
necessarily
arising
out
of
our
constitution
by
which
the
general
government
is
made
the
organ
of
negotiating
and
deciding
upon
the
particular
interests
of
the
states
on
whose
frontiers
these
lines
are
to
be
traced
to
avoid
another
controversy
in
which
a
state
government
might
rightfully
claim
to
have
her
wishes
consulted
previously
to
the
conclusion
of
conventional
arrangements
concerning
her
rights
of
jurisdiction
or
territory
i
have
thought
it
necessary
to
call
the
attention
of
the
government
of
great
britain
to
another
portion
of
our
conterminous
dominion
of
which
the
division
still
remains
to
be
adjusted
i
refer
to
the
line
from
the
entrance
of
lake
superior
to
the
most
northwestern
point
of
the
lake
of
the
woods
stipulations
for
the
settlement
of
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
seventh
article
of
the
treaty
of
ghent
the
commissioners
appointed
under
that
article
by
the
two
governments
having
differed
in
their
opinions
made
separate
reports
according
to
its
stipulations
upon
the
points
of
disagreement
and
these
differences
are
now
to
be
submitted
to
the
arbitration
of
some
friendly
sovereign
or
state
the
disputed
points
should
be
settled
and
the
line
designated
before
the
territorial
government
of
which
it
is
one
of
the
boundaries
takes
its
place
in
the
union
as
a
state
and
i
rely
upon
the
cordial
cooperation
of
the
british
government
to
effect
that
object
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
disturbances
like
those
which
lately
agitated
the
neighboring
british
provinces
will
not
again
prove
the
sources
of
border
contentions
or
interpose
obstacles
to
the
continuance
of
that
good
understanding
which
it
is
the
mutual
interest
of
great
britain
and
the
united
states
to
preserve
and
maintain
within
the
provinces
themselves
tranquillity
is
restored
and
on
our
frontier
that
misguided
sympathy
in
favor
of
what
was
presumed
to
be
a
general
effort
in
behalf
of
popular
rights
and
which
in
some
instances
misled
a
few
of
our
more
inexperienced
citizens
has
subsided
into
a
rational
conviction
strongly
opposed
to
all
intermeddling
with
the
internal
affairs
of
our
neighbors
the
people
of
the
united
states
feel
as
it
is
hoped
they
always
will
a
warm
solicitude
for
the
success
of
all
who
are
sincerely
endeavoring
to
improve
the
political
condition
of
mankind
this
generous
feeling
they
cherish
toward
the
most
distant
nations
and
it
was
natural
therefore
that
it
should
be
awakened
with
more
than
common
warmth
in
behalf
of
their
immediate
neighbors
but
it
does
not
belong
to
their
character
as
a
community
to
seek
the
gratification
of
those
feelings
in
acts
which
violate
their
duty
as
citizens
endanger
the
peace
of
their
country
and
tend
to
bring
upon
it
the
stain
of
a
violated
faith
toward
foreign
nations
if
zealous
to
confer
benefits
on
others
they
appear
for
a
moment
to
lose
sight
of
the
permanent
obligations
imposed
upon
them
as
citizens
they
are
seldom
long
misled
from
all
the
information
i
receive
confirmed
to
some
extent
by
personal
observation
i
am
satisfied
that
no
one
can
now
hope
to
engage
in
such
enterprises
without
encountering
public
indignation
in
addition
to
the
severest
penalties
of
the
law
recent
information
also
leads
me
to
hope
that
the
emigrants
from
her
majestys
provinces
who
have
sought
refuge
within
our
boundaries
are
disposed
to
become
peaceable
residents
and
to
abstain
from
all
attempts
to
endanger
the
peace
of
that
country
which
has
afforded
them
an
asylum
on
a
review
of
the
occurrences
on
both
sides
of
the
line
it
is
satisfactory
to
reflect
that
in
almost
every
complaint
against
our
country
the
offense
may
be
traced
to
emigrants
from
the
provinces
who
have
sought
refuge
here
in
the
few
instances
in
which
they
were
aided
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
acts
of
these
misguided
men
were
not
only
in
direct
contravention
of
the
laws
and
wellknown
wishes
of
their
own
government
but
met
with
the
decided
disapprobation
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
regret
to
state
the
appearance
of
a
different
spirit
among
her
majestys
subjects
in
the
canadas
the
sentiments
of
hostility
to
our
people
and
institutions
which
have
been
so
frequently
expressed
there
and
the
disregard
of
our
rights
which
has
been
manifested
on
some
occasions
have
i
am
sorry
to
say
been
applauded
and
encouraged
by
the
people
and
even
by
some
of
the
subordinate
local
authorities
of
the
provinces
the
chief
officers
in
canada
fortunately
have
not
entertained
the
same
feeling
and
have
probably
prevented
excesses
that
must
have
been
fatal
to
the
peace
of
the
two
countries
i
look
forward
anxiously
to
a
period
when
all
the
transactions
which
have
grown
out
of
this
condition
of
our
affairs
and
which
have
been
made
the
subjects
of
complaint
and
remonstrance
by
the
two
governments
respectively
shall
be
fully
examined
and
the
proper
satisfaction
given
where
it
is
due
from
either
side
nothing
has
occurred
to
disturb
the
harmony
of
our
intercourse
with
austria
belgium
denmark
france
naples
portugal
prussia
russia
or
sweden
the
internal
state
of
spain
has
sensibly
improved
and
a
wellgrounded
hope
exists
that
the
return
of
peace
will
restore
to
the
people
of
that
country
their
former
prosperity
and
enable
the
government
to
fulfill
all
its
obligations
at
home
and
abroad
the
government
of
portugal
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
state
has
paid
in
full
the
eleventh
and
last
installment
due
to
our
citizens
for
the
claims
embraced
in
the
settlement
made
with
it
on
the
d
of
march
i
lay
before
you
treaties
of
commerce
negotiated
with
the
kings
of
sardinia
and
of
the
netherlands
the
ratifications
of
which
have
been
exchanged
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
the
liberal
principles
of
these
treaties
will
recommend
them
to
your
approbation
that
with
sardinia
is
the
first
treaty
of
commerce
formed
by
that
kingdom
and
it
will
i
trust
answer
the
expectations
of
the
present
sovereign
by
aiding
the
development
of
the
resources
of
his
country
and
stimulating
the
enterprise
of
his
people
that
with
the
netherlands
happily
terminates
a
longexisting
subject
of
dispute
and
removes
from
our
future
commercial
intercourse
all
apprehension
of
embarrassment
the
king
of
the
netherlands
has
also
in
further
illustration
of
his
character
for
justice
and
of
his
desire
to
remove
every
cause
of
dissatisfaction
made
compensation
for
an
american
vessel
captured
in
by
a
french
privateer
and
carried
into
curacoa
where
the
proceeds
were
appropriated
to
the
use
of
the
colony
then
and
for
a
short
time
after
under
the
dominion
of
holland
the
death
of

the
late
sultan
has
produced
no
alteration
in
our
relations
with
turkey
our
newly
appointed
minister
resident
has
reached
constantinople
and
i
have
received
assurances
from
the
present
ruler
that
the
obligations
of
our
treaty
and
those
of
friendship
will
be
fulfilled
by
himself
in
the
same
spirit
that
actuated
his
illustrious
father
i
regret
to
be
obliged
to
inform
you
that
no
convention
for
the
settlement
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
mexico
has
yet
been
ratified
by
the
government
of
that
country
the
first
convention
formed
for
that
purpose
was
not
presented
by
the
president
of
mexico
for
the
approbation
of
its
congress
from
a
belief
that
the
king
of
prussia
the
arbitrator
in
case
of
disagreement
in
the
joint
commission
to
be
appointed
by
the
united
states
and
mexico
would
not
consent
to
take
upon
himself
that
friendly
office
although
not
entirely
satisfied
with
the
course
pursued
by
mexico
i
felt
no
hesitation
in
receiving
in
the
most
conciliatory
spirit
the
explanation
offered
and
also
cheerfully
consented
to
a
new
convention
in
order
to
arrange
the
payments
proposed
to
be
made
to
our
citizens
in
a
manner
which
while
equally
just
to
them
was
deemed
less
onerous
and
inconvenient
to
the
mexican
government
relying
confidently
upon
the
intentions
of
that
government
mr
ellis
was
directed
to
repair
to
mexico
and
diplomatic
intercourse
has
been
resumed
between
the
two
countries
the
new
convention
has

informs
us
been
recently
submitted
by
the
president
of
that
republic
to
its
congress
under
circumstances
which
promise
a
speedy
ratification
a
result
which
i
can
not
allow
myself
to
doubt
instructions
have
been
given
to
the
commissioner
of
the

under
our
convention
with

for
the
demarcation
of
the
line
which
separates

the

in

to
convene
at
the

place
on
the
th
of
october
it
is
presumed
to
be
now
in
the
performance
of
its
duties
the
new
government
of
texas
has
shown
its
desire
to
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
us
by
a
prompt
reparation
for
injuries
complained
of
in
the
cases
of
two
vessels
of

with

america
a
convention
has
been
concluded
for
the
renewal
of
its
former
treaty
with

this
was
not
ratified
before
the
departure
of

from

of
the
senate
at
the
last
session
in
the
meanwhile
the
period
limited
for
the
exchange
of
ratifications
having
expired
i
deemed
it
expedient
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
the
charge
daffaires
to
send
a
special
agent
to
central
america
to
close
the
affairs
of
our
mission
there
and
to
arrange
with
the
government
an
extension
of
the
time
for
the
exchange
of
ratifications
the
commission
created
by
the
states
which
formerly
composed
the
republic
of
colombia
for
adjusting
the
claims
against
that
government
has
by
a
very
unexpected
construction
of
the
treaty
under
which
it
acts
decided
that
no
provision
was
made
for
those
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
which
arose
from
captures
by
colombian
privateers
and
were
adjudged
against
the
claimants
in
the
judicial
tribunals
this
decision
will
compel
the
united
states
to
apply
to
the
several
governments
formerly
united
for
redress
with
all
thesenew
granada
venezuela
and
ecuadora
perfectly
good
understanding
exists
our
treaty
with
venezuela
is
faithfully
carried
into
execution
and
that
country
in
the
enjoyment
of
tranquillity
is
gradually
advancing
in
prosperity
under
the
guidance
of
its
present
distinguished
president
general
paez
with
ecuador
a
liberal
commercial
convention
has
lately
been
concluded
which
will
be
transmitted
to
the
senate
at
an
early
day
with
the
great
american
empire
of
brazil
our
relations
continue
unchanged
as
does
our
friendly
intercourse
with
the
other
governments
of
south
americathe
argentine
republic
and
the
republics
of
uruguay
chili
peru
and
bolivia
the
dissolution
of
the
perubolivian
confederation
may
occasion
some
temporary
inconvenience
to
our
citizens
in
that
quarter
but
the
obligations
on
the
new
governments
which
have
arisen
out
of
that
confederation
to
observe
its
treaty
stipulations
will
no
doubt
be
soon
understood
and
it
is
presumed
that
no
indisposition
will
exist
to
fulfill
those
which
it
contracted
with
the
united
states
the
financial
operations
of
the
government
during
the
present
year
have
i
am
happy
to
say
been
very
successful
the
difficulties
under
which
the
treasury
department
has
labored
from
known
defects
in
the
existing
laws
relative
to
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
moneys
aggravated
by
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
by
several
of
the
banks
holding
public
deposits
or
indebted
to
public
officers
for
notes
received
in
payment
of
public
dues
have
been
surmounted
to
a
very
gratifying
extent
the
large
current
expenditures
have
been
punctually
met
and
the
faith
of
the
government
in
all
its
pecuniary
concerns
has
been
scrupulously
maintained
the
nineteen
millions
of
treasury
notes
authorized
by
the
act
of
congress
of
and
the
modifications
thereof
with
a
view
to
the
indulgence
of
merchants
on
their
duty
bonds
and
of
the
deposit
banks
in
the
payment
of
public
moneys
held
by
them
have
been
so
punctually
redeemed
as
to
leave
less
than
the
original
ten
millions
outstanding
at
any
one
time
and
the
whole
amount
unredeemed
now
falls
short
of
three
millions
of
these
the
chief
portion
is
not
due
till
next
year
and
the
whole
would
have
been
already
extinguished
could
the
treasury
have
realized
the
payments
due
to
it
from
the
banks
if
those
due
from
them
during
the
next
year
shall
be
punctually
made
and
if
congress
shall
keep
the
appropriations
within
the
estimates
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
all
the
outstanding
treasury
notes
can
be
redeemed
and
the
ordinary
expenses
defrayed
without
imposing
on
the
people
any
additional
burden
either
of
loans
or
increased
taxes
to
avoid
this
and
to
keep
the
expenditures
within
reasonable
bounds
is
a
duty
second
only
in
importance
to
the
preservation
of
our
national
character
and
the
protection
of
our
citizens
in
their
civil
and
political
rights
the
creation
in
time
of
peace
of
a
debt
likely
to
become
permanent
is
an
evil
for
which
there
is
no
equivalent
the
rapidity
with
which
many
of
the
states
are
apparently
approaching
to
this
condition
admonishes
us
of
our
own
duties
in
a
manner
too
impressive
to
be
disregarded
one
not
the
least
important
is
to
keep
the
federal
government
always
in
a
condition
to
discharge
with
ease
and
vigor
its
highest
functions
should
their
exercise
be
required
by
any
sudden
conjuncture
of
public
affairsa
condition
to
which
we
are
always
exposed
and
which
may
occur
when
it
is
least
expected
to
this
end
it
is
indispensable
that
its
finances
should
be
untrammeled
and
its
resources
as
far
as
practicable
unencumbered
no
circumstance
could
present
greater
obstacles
to
the
accomplishment
of
these
vitally
important
objects
than
the
creation
of
an
onerous
national
debt
our
own
experience
and
also
that
of
other
nations
have
demonstrated
the
unavoidable
and
fearful
rapidity
with
which
a
public
debt
is
increased
when
the
government
has
once
surrendered
itself
to
the
ruinous
practice
of
supplying
its
supposed
necessities
by
new
loans
the
struggle
therefore
on
our
part
to
be
successful
must
be
made
at
the
threshold
to
make
our
efforts
effective
severe
economy
is
necessary
this
is
the
surest
provision
for
the
national
welfare
and
it
is
at
the
same
time
the
best
preservative
of
the
principles
on
which
our
institutions
rest
simplicity
and
economy
in
the
affairs
of
state
have
never
failed
to
chasten
and
invigorate
republican
principles
while
these
have
been
as
surely
subverted
by
national
prodigality
under
whatever
specious
pretexts
it
may
have
been
introduced
or
fostered
these
considerations
can
not
be
lost
upon
a
people
who
have
never
been
inattentive
to
the
effect
of
their
policy
upon
the
institutions
they
have
created
for
themselves
but
at
the
present
moment
their
force
is
augmented
by
the
necessity
which
a
decreasing
revenue
must
impose
the
check
lately
given
to
importations
of
articles
subject
to
duties
the
derangements
in
the
operations
of
internal
trade
and
especially
the
reduction
gradually
taking
place
in
our
tariff
of
duties
all
tend
materially
to
lessen
our
receipts
indeed
it
is
probable
that
the
diminution
resulting
from
the
last
cause
alone
will
not
fall
short
of
in
the
year
as
the
final
reduction
of
all
duties
to
per
cent
then
takes
effect
the
whole
revenue
then
accruing
from
the
customs
and
from
the
sales
of
public
lands
if
not
more
will
undoubtedly
be
wanted
to
defray
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
government
under
the
most
prudent
administration
of
its
affairs
these
are
circumstances
that
impose
the
necessity
of
rigid
economy
and
require
its
prompt
and
constant
exercise
with
the
legislature
rest
the
power
and
duty
of
so
adjusting
the
public
expenditure
as
to
promote
this
end
by
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
it
is
only
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law
that
money
can
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
no
instance
has
occurred
since
the
establishment
of
the
government
in
which
the
executive
though
a
component
part
of
the
legislative
power
has
interposed
an
objection
to
an
appropriation
bill
on
the
sole
ground
of
its
extravagance
his
duty
in
this
respect
has
been
considered
fulfilled
by
requesting
such
appropriations
only
as
the
public
service
may
be
reasonably
expected
to
require
in
the
present
earnest
direction
of
the
public
mind
toward
this
subject
both
the
executive
and
the
legislature
have
evidence
of
the
strict
responsibility
to
which
they
will
be
held
and
while
i
am
conscious
of
my
own
anxious
efforts
to
perform
with
fidelity
this
portion
of
my
public
functions
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
be
able
to
count
on
a
cordial
cooperation
from
you
at
the
time
i
entered
upon
my
present
duties
our
ordinary
disbursements
without

including
those
on
account
of
the
public
debt
the
postoffice
and
the
trust
funds
in
charge
of
the
government
had
been
largely
increased
by
appropriations
for
the
removal
of
the
indians
for
repelling
indian
hostilities
and
for
other
less
urgent
expenses
which
grew
out
of
an
overflowing
treasury
independent
of
the
redemption
of
the
public
debt
and
trusts
the
gross
expenditures
of
seventeen
and
eighteen
millions
in
and
had
by
these
causes
swelled
to
twentynine
millions
in
and
the
appropriations
for
made
previously
to
the
th
of
march
caused
the
expenditure
to
rise
to
the
very
large
amount
of
thirtythree
millions
we
were
enabled
during
the
year
notwithstanding
the
continuance
of
our
indian
embarrassments
somewhat
to
reduce
this
amount
and
that
for
the
present
year
will
not
in
all
probability
exceed
twentysix
millions
or
six
millions
less
than
it
was
last
year
with
a
determination
so
far
as
depends
on
me
to
continue
this
reduction
i
have
directed
the
estimates
for
to
be
subjected
to
the
severest
scrutiny
and
to
be
limited
to
the
absolute
requirements
of
the
public
service
they
will
be
found
less
than
the
expenditures
of
by
over
the
precautionary
measures
which
will
be
recommended
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
protect
faithfully
the
public
credit
under
the
fluctuations
and
contingencies
to
which
our
receipts
and
expenditures
are
exposed
and
especially
in
a
commercial
crisis
like
the
present
are
commended
to
your
early
attention
on
a
former
occasion
your
attention
was
invited
to
various
considerations
in
support
of
a
preemption
law
in
behalf
of
the
settlers
on
the
public
lands
and
also
of
a
law
graduating
the
prices
for
such
lands
as
had
long
been
in
the
market
unsold
in
consequence
of
their
inferior
quality
the
execution
of
the
act
which
was
passed
on
the
first
subject
has
been
attended
with
the
happiest
consequences
in
quieting
titles
and
securing
improvements
to
the
industrious
and
it
has
also
to
a
very
gratifying
extent
been
exempt
from
the
frauds
which
were
practiced
under
previous
preemption
laws
it
has
at
the
same
time
as
was
anticipated
contributed
liberally
during
the
present
year
to
the
receipts
of
the
treasury
the
passage
of
a
graduation
law
with
the
guards
before
recommended
would
also
i
am
persuaded
add
considerably
to
the
revenue
for
several
years
and
prove
in
other
respects
just
and
beneficial
your
early
consideration
of
the
subject
is
therefore
once
more
earnestly
requested
the
present
condition
of
the
defenses
of
our
principal
seaports
and
navyyards
as
represented
by
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
calls
for
the
early
and
serious
attention
of
congress
and
as
connecting
itself
intimately
with
this
subject
i
can
not
recommend
too
strongly
to
your
consideration
the
plan
submitted
by
that
officer
for
the
organization
of
the
militia
of
the
united
states
in
conformity
with
the
expressed
wishes
of
congress
an
attempt
was
made
in
the
spring
to
terminate
the
florida
war
by
negotiation
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
these
humane
intentions
should
have
been
frustrated
and
that
the
effort
to
bring
these
unhappy
difficulties
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
should
have
failed
but
after
entering
into
solemn
engagements
with
the
commanding
general
the
indians
without
any
provocation
recommenced
their
acts
of
treachery
and
murder
the
renewal
of
hostilities
in
that
territory
renders
it
necessary
that
i
should
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
plan
which
will
be
submitted
to
you
by
the
secretary
of
war
in
order
to
enable
that
department
to
conduct
them
to
a
successful
issue
having
had
an
opportunity
of
personally
inspecting
a
portion
of
the
troops
during
the
last
summer
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
bear
testimony
to
the
success
of
the
effort
to
improve
their
discipline
by
keeping
them
together
in
as
large
bodies
as
the
nature
of
our
service
will
permit
i
recommend
therefore
that
commodious
and
permanent
barracks
be
constructed
at
the
several
posts
designated
by
the
secretary
of
war
notwithstanding
the
high
state
of
their
discipline
and
excellent
police
the
evils
resulting
to
the
service
from
the
deficiency
of
company
officers
were
very
apparent
and
i
recommend
that
the
staff
officers
be
permanently
separated
from
the
line
the
navy
has
been
usefully
and
honorably
employed
in
protecting
the
rights
and
property
of
our
citizens
wherever
the
condition
of
affairs
seemed
to
require
its
presence
with
the
exception
of
one
instance
where
an
outrage
accompanied
by
murder
was
committed
on
a
vessel
of
the
united
states
while
engaged
in
a
lawful
commerce
nothing
is
known
to
have
occurred
to
impede
or
molest
the
enterprise
of
our
citizens
on
that
element
where
it
is
so
signally
displayed
on
learning
this
daring
act
of
piracy
commodore
reed
proceeded
immediately
to
the
spot
and
receiving
no
satisfaction
either
in
the
surrender
of
the
murderers
or
the
restoration
of
the
plundered
property
inflicted
severe
and
merited
chastisement
on
the
barbarians
it
will
be
seen
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
respecting
the
disposition
of
our
ships
of
war
that
it
has
been
deemed
necessary
to
station
a
competent
force
on
the
coast
of
africa
to
prevent
a
fraudulent
use
of
our
flag
by
foreigners
recent
experience
has
shown
that
the
provisions
in
our
existing
laws
which
relate
to
the
sale
and
transfer
of
american
vessels
while
abroad
are
extremely
defective
advantage
has
been
taken
of
these
defects
to
give
to
vessels
wholly
belonging
to
foreigners
and
navigating
the
ocean
an
apparent
american
ownership
this
character
has
been
so
well
simulated
as
to
afford
them
comparative
security
in
prosecuting
the
slave
tradea
traffic
emphatically
denounced
in
our
statutes
regarded
with
abhorrence
by
our
citizens
and
of
which
the
effectual
suppression
is
nowhere
more
sincerely
desired
than
in
the
united
states
these
circumstances
make
it
proper
to
recommend
to
your
early
attention
a
careful
revision
of
these
laws
so
that
without
impeding
the
freedom
and
facilities
of
our
navigation
or
impairing
an
important
branch
of
our
industry
connected
with
it
the
integrity
and
honor
of
our
flag
may
be
carefully
preserved
information
derived
from
our
consul
at
havana
showing
the
necessity
of
this
was
communicated
to
a
committee
of
the
senate
near
the
close
of
the
last
session
but
too
late
as
it
appeared
to
be
acted
upon
it
will
be
brought
to
your
notice
by
the
proper
department
with
additional
communications
from
other
sources
the
latest
accounts
from
the
exploring
expedition
represent
it
as
proceeding
successfully
in
its
objects
and
promising
results
no
less
useful
to
trade
and
navigation
than
to
science
the
extent
of
postroads
covered
by
mail
service
on
the
st
of
july
last
was
about
miles
and
the
rate
of
annual
transportation
upon
them
miles
the
number
of
postoffices
on
that
day
was
and
on
the
th
ultimo
the
revenue
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
year
ending
with
the
th
of
june
last
was
exhibiting
an
increase
over
the
preceding
year
of
the
engagements
and
liabilities
of
the
department
for
the
same
period
are
the
excess
of
liabilities
over
the
revenue
for
the
last
two
years
has
been
met
out
of
the
surplus
which
had
previously
accumulated
the
cash
on
hand
on
the
th
ultimo
was
about
and
the
current
income
of
the
department
varies
very
little
from
the
rate
of
current
expenditures
most
of
the
service
suspended
last
year
has
been
restored
and
most
of
the
new
routes
established
by
the
act
of
th
july
have
been
set
in
operation
at
an
annual
cost
of
notwithstanding
the
pecuniary
difficulties
of
the
country
the
revenue
of
the
department
appears
to
be
increasing
and
unless
it
shall
be
seriously
checked
by
the
recent
suspension
of
payment
by
so
many
of
the
banks
it
will
be
able
not
only
to
maintain
the
present
mail
service
but
in
a
short
time
to
extend
it
it
is
gratifying
to
witness
the
promptitude
and
fidelity
with
which
the
agents
of
this
department
in
general
perform
their
public
duties
some
difficulties
have
arisen
in
relation
to
contracts
for
the
transportation
of
the
mails
by
railroad
and
steamboat
companies
it
appears
that
the
maximum
of
compensation
provided
by
congress
for
the
transportation
of
the
mails
upon
railroads
is
not
sufficient
to
induce
some
of
the
companies
to
convey
them
at
such
hours
as
are
required
for
the
accommodation
of
the
public
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
duties
of
the
general
government
to
provide
and
maintain
for
the
use
of
the
people
of
the
states
the
best
practicable
mail
establishment
to
arrive
at
that
end
it
is
indispensable
that
the
postoffice
department
shall
be
enabled
to
control
the
hours
at
which
the
mails
shall
be
carried
over
railroads
as
it
now
does
over
all
other
roads
should
serious
inconveniences
arise
from
the
inadequacy
of
the
compensation
now
provided
by
law
or
from
unreasonable
demands
by
any
of
the
railroad
companies
the
subject
is
of
such
general
importance
as
to
require
the
prompt
attention
of
congress
in
relation
to
steamboat
lines
the
most
efficient
remedy
is
obvious
and
has
been
suggested
by
the
postmastergeneral
the
war
and
navy
departments
already
employ
steamboats
in
their
service
and
although
it
is
by
no
means
desirable
that
the
government
should
undertake
the
transportation
of
passengers
or
freight
as
a
business
there
can
be
no
reasonable
objection
to
running
boats
temporarily
whenever
it
may
be
necessary
to
put
down
attempts
at
extortion
to
be
discontinued
as
soon
as
reasonable
contracts
can
be
obtained
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
relative
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
legal
allowance
to
witnesses
in
cases
of
prosecutions
for
mail
depredations
merit
your
serious
consideration
the
safety
of
the
mails
requires
that
such
prosecutions
shall
be
efficient
and
justice
to
the
citizen
whose
time
is
required
to
be
given
to
the
public
demands
not
only
that
his
expenses
shall
be
paid
but
that
he
shall
receive
a
reasonable
compensation
the
reports
from
the
war
navy
and
postoffice
departments
will
accompany
this
communication
and
one
from
the
treasury
department
will
be
presented
to
congress
in

a
few
days
for
various
details
in
respect
to
the
matters
in
charge
of
these
departments
i
would
refer
you
to
those
important
documents
satisfied
that
you
will
find
in
them
many
valuable
suggestions
which
will
be
found
well
deserving
the
attention
of
the
legislature
from
a
report
made
in
december
of
last
year
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
senate
showing
the
trial
docket
of
each
of
the
circuit
courts
and
the
number
of
miles
each
judge
has
to
travel
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
a
great
inequality
appears
in
the
amount
of
labor
assigned
to
each
judge
the
number
of
terms
to
be
held
in
each
of
the
courts
composing
the
ninth
circuit
the
distances
between
the
places
at
which
they
sit
and
from
thence
to
the
seat
of
government
are
represented
to
be
such
as
to
render
it
impossible
for
the
judge
of
that
circuit
to
perform
in
a
manner
corresponding
with
the
public
exigencies
his
term
and
circuit
duties
a
revision
therefore
of
the
present
arrangement
of
the
circuit
seems
to
be
called
for
and
is
recommended
to
your
notice
i
think
it
proper
to
call
your
attention
to
the
power
assumed
by
territorial
legislatures
to
authorize
the
issue
of
bonds
by
corporate
companies
on
the
guaranty
of
the
territory
congress
passed
a
law
in
providing
that
no
act
of
a
territorial
legislature
incorporating
banks
should
have
the
force
of
law
until
approved
by
congress
but
acts
of
a
very
exceptionable
character
previously
passed
by
the
legislature
of
florida
were
suffered
to
remain
in
force
by
virtue
of
which
bonds
may
be
issued
to
a
very
large
amount
by
those
institutions
upon
the
faith
of
the
territory
a
resolution
intending
to
be
a
joint
one
passed
the
senate
at
the
same
session
expressing
the
sense
of
congress
that
the
laws
in
question
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
remain
in
force
unless
amended
in
many
material
respects
but
it
failed
in
the
house
of
representatives
for
want
of
time
and
the
desired
amendments
have
not
been
made
the
interests
involved
are
of
great
importance
and
the
subject
deserves
your
early
and
careful
attention
the
continued
agitation
of
the
question
relative
to
the
best
mode
of
keeping
and
disbursing
the
public
money
still
injuriously
affects
the
business
of
the
country
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
in
rendered
the
use
of
deposit
banks
as
prescribed
by
the
act
of
a
source
rather
of
embarrassment
than
aid
and
of
necessity
placed
the
custody
of
most
of
the
public
money
afterwards
collected
in
charge
of
the
public
officers
the
new
securities
for
its
safety
which
this
required
were
a
principal
cause
of
my
convening
an
extra
session
of
congress
but
in
consequence
of
a
disagreement
between
the
two
houses
neither
then
nor
at
any
subsequent
period
has
there
been
any
legislation
on
the
subject
the
effort
made
at
the
last
session
to
obtain
the
authority
of
congress
to
punish
the
use
of
public
money
for
private
purposes
as
a
crime
a
measure
attended
under
other
governments
with
signal
advantagewas
also
unsuccessful
from
diversities
of
opinion
in
that
body
notwithstanding
the
anxiety
doubtless
felt
by
it
to
afford
every
practicable
security
the
result
of
this
is
still
to
leave
the
custody
of
the
public
money
without
those
safeguards
which
have
been
for
several
years
earnestly
desired
by
the
executive
and
as
the
remedy
is
only
to
be
found
in
the
action
of
the
legislature
it
imposes
on
me
the
duty
of
again
submitting
to
you
the
propriety
of
passing
a
law
providing
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
moneys
and
especially
to
ask
that
its
use
for
private
purposes
by
any
officers
intrusted
with
it
may
be
declared
to
be
a
felony
punishable
with
penalties
proportioned
to
the
magnitude
of
the
offense
these
circumstances
added
to
known
defects
in
the
existing
laws
and
unusual
derangement
in
the
general
operations
of
trade
have
during
the
last
three
years
much
increased
the
difficulties
attendant
on
the
collection
keeping
and
disbursement
of
the
revenue
and
called
forth
corresponding
exertions
from
those
having
them
in
charge
happily
these
have
been
successful
beyond
expectation
vast
sums
have
been
collected
and
disbursed
by
the
several
departments
with
unexpected
cheapness
and
ease
transfers
have
been
readily
made
to
every
part
of
the
union
however
distant
and
defalcations
have
been
far
less
than
might
have
been
anticipated
from
the
absence
of
adequate
legal
restraints
since
the
officers
of
the
treasury
and
postoffice
departments
were
charged
with
the
custody
of
most
of
the
public
moneys
received
by
them
there
have
been
collected
and
excluding
the
case
of
the
late
collector
at
new
york
the
aggregate
amount
of
losses
sustained
in
the
collection
can
not
it
is
believed
exceed
the
defalcation
of
the
late
collector
at
that
city
of
the
extent
and
circumstances
of
which
congress
have
been
fully
informed
ran
through
all
the
modes
of
keeping
the
public
money
that
have
been
hitherto
in
use
and
was
distinguished
by
an
aggravated
disregard
of
duty
that
broke
through
the
restraints
of
every
system
and
can
not
therefore
be
usefully
referred
to
as
a
test
of
the
comparative
safety
of
either
additional
information
will
also
be
furnished
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
reply
to
a
call
made
upon
that
officer
by
the
house
of
representatives
at
the
last
session
requiring
detailed
information
on
the
subject
of
defaults
by
public
officers
or
agents
under
each
administration
from
to
this
document
will
be
submitted
to
you
in
a
few
days
the
general
results
independent
of
the
postoffice
which
is
kept
separately
and
will
be
stated
by
itself
so
far
as
they
bear
upon
this
subject
are
that
the
losses
which
have
been
and
are
likely
to
be
sustained
by
any
class
of
agents
have
been
the
greatest
by
banks
including
as
required
in
the
resolution
their
depreciated
paper
received
for
public
dues
that
the
next
largest
have
been
by
disbursing
officers
and
the
least
by
collectors
and
receivers
if
the
losses
on
duty
bonds
are
included
they
alone
will
be
threefold
those
by
both
collectors
and
receivers
our
whole
experience
therefore
furnishes
the
strongest
evidence
that
the
desired
legislation
of
congress
is
alone
wanting
to
insure
in
those
operations
the
highest
degree
of
security
and
facility
such
also
appears
to
have
been
the
experience
of
other
nations
from
the
results
of
inquiries
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
regard
to
the
practice
among
them
i
am
enabled
to
state
that
in
twentytwo
out
of
twentyseven
foreign
governments
from
which
undoubted
information
has
been
obtained
the
public
moneys
are
kept
in
charge
of
public
officers
this
concurrence
of
opinion
in
favor
of
that
system
is
perhaps
as
great
as
exists
on
any
question
of
internal
administration
in
the
modes
of
business
and
official
restraints
on
disbursing
officers
no
legal
change
was
produced
by
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
the
report
last
referred
to
will
be
found
to
contain
also
much
useful
information
in
relation
to
this
subject
i
have
heretofore
assigned
to
congress
my
reasons
for
believing
that
the
establishment
of
an
independent
national
treasury
as
contemplated
by
the
constitution
is
necessary
to
the
safe
action
of
the
federal
government
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
in
by
the
banks
having
the
custody
of
the
public
money
showed
in
so
alarming
a
degree
our
dependence
on
those
institutions
for
the
performance
of
duties
required
by
law
that
i
then
recommended
the
entire
dissolution
of
that
connection
this
recommendation
has
been
subjected
as
i
desired
it
should
be
to
severe
scrutiny
and
animated
discussion
and
i
allow
myself
to
believe
that
notwithstanding
the
natural
diversities
of
opinion
which
may
be
anticipated
on
all
subjects
involving
such
important
considerations
it
has
secured
in
its
favor
as
general
a
concurrence
of
public
sentiment
as
could
be
expected
on
one
of
such
magnitude
recent
events
have
also
continued
to
develop
new
objections
to
such
a
connection
seldom
is
any
bank
under
the
existing
system
and
practice
able
to
meet
on
demand
all
its
liabilities
for
deposits
and
notes
in
circulation
it
maintains
specie
payments
and
transacts
a
profitable
business
only
by
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
its
solvency
and
whenever
this
is
destroyed
the
demands
of
its
depositors
and
note
holders
pressed
more
rapidly
than
it
can
make
collections
from
its
debtors
force
it
to
stop
payment
this
loss
of
confidence
with
its
consequences
occurred
in
and
afforded
the
apology
of
the
banks
for
their
suspension
the
public
then
acquiesced
in
the
validity
of
the
excuse
and
while
the
state
legislatures
did
not
exact
from
them
their
forfeited
charters
congress
in
accordance
with
the
recommendation
of
the
executive
allowed
them
time
to
pay
over
the
public
money
they
held
although
compelled
to
issue
treasury
notes
to
supply
the
deficiency
thus
created
it
now
appears
that
there
are
other
motives
than
a
want
of
public
confidence
under
which
the
banks
seek
to
justify
themselves
in
a
refusal
to
meet
their
obligations
scarcely
were
the
country
and
government
relieved
in
a
degree
from
the
difficulties
occasioned
by
the
general
suspension
of
when
a
partial
one
occurring
within
thirty
months
of
the
former
produced
new
and
serious
embarrassments
though
it
had
no
palliation
in
such
circumstances
as
were
alleged
in
justification
of
that
which
had
previously
taken
place
there
was
nothing
in
the
condition
of
the
country
to
endanger
a
wellmanaged
banking
institution
commerce
was
deranged
by
no
foreign
war
every
branch
of
manufacturing
industry
was
crowned
with
rich
rewards
and
the
more
than
usual
abundance
of
our
harvests
after
supplying
our
domestic
wants
had
left
our
granaries
and
storehouses
filled
with
a
surplus
for
exportation
it
is
in
the
midst
of
this
that
an
irredeemable
and
depreciated
paper
currency
is
entailed
upon
the
people
by
a
large
portion
of
the
banks
they
are
not
driven
to
it
by
the
exhibition
of
a
loss
of
public
confidence
or
of
a
sudden
pressure
from
their
depositors
or
note
holders
but
they
excuse
themselves
by
alleging
that
the
current
of
business
and
exchange
with
foreign
countries
wh
ich
draws
the
precious
metals
from
their
vaults
would
require
in
order
to
meet
it
a
larger
curtailment
of
their
loans
to
a
comparatively
small
portion
of
the
community
than
it
will
be
convenient
for
them
to
bear
or
perhaps
safe
for
the
banks
to
exact
the
plea
has
ceased
to
be
one
of
necessity
convenience
and
policy
are
now
deemed
sufficient
to
warrant
these
institutions
in
disregarding
their
solemn
obligations
such
conduct
is
not
merely
an
injury
to
individual
creditors
but
it
is
a
wrong
to
the
whole
community
from
whose
liberality
they
hold
most
valuable
privileges
whose
rights
they
violate
whose
business
they
derange
and
the
value
of
whose
property
they
render
unstable
and
insecure
it
must
be
evident
that
this
new
ground
for
bank
suspensions
in
reference
to
which
their
action
is
not
only
disconnected
with
but
wholly
independent
of
that
of
the
public
gives
a
character
to
their
suspensions
more
alarming
than
any
which
they
exhibited
before
and
greatly
increases
the
impropriety
of
relying
on
the
banks
in
the
transactions
of
the
government
a
large
and
highly
respectable
portion
of
our
banking
institutions
are
it
affords
me
unfeigned
pleasure
to
state
exempted
from
all
blame
on
account
of
this
second
delinquency
they
have
to
their
great
credit
not
only
continued
to
meet
their
engagements
but
have
even
repudiated
the
grounds
of
suspension
now
resorted
to
it
is
only
by
such
a
course
that
the
confidence
and
good
will
of
the
community
can
be
preserved
and
in
the
sequel
the
best
interests
of
the
institutions
themselves
promoted
new
dangers
to
the
banks
are
also
daily
disclosed
from
the
extension
of
that
system
of
extravagant
credit
of
which
they
are
the
pillars
formerly
our
foreign
commerce
was
principally
rounded
on
an
exchange
of
commodities
including
the
precious
metals
and
leaving
in
its
transactions
but
little
foreign
debt
such
is
not
now
the
case
aided
by
the
facilities
afforded
by
the
banks
mere
credit
has
become
too
commonly
the
basis
of
trade
many
of
the
banks
themselves
not
content
with
largely
stimulating
this
system
among
others
have
usurped
the
business
while
they
impair
the
stability
of
the
mercantile
community
they
have
become
borrowers
instead
of
lenders
they
establish
their
agencies
abroad
they
deal
largely
in
stocks
and
merchandise
they
encourage
the
issue
of
state
securities
until
the
foreign
market
is
glutted
with
them
and
unsatisfied
with
the
legitimate
use
of
their
own
capital
and
the
exercise
of
their
lawful
privileges
they
raise
by
large
loans
additional
means
for
every
variety
of
speculation
the
disasters
attendant
on
this
deviation
from
the
former
course
of
business
in
this
country
are
now
shared
alike
by
banks
and
individuals
to
an
extent
of
which
there
is
perhaps
no
previous
example
in
the
annals
of
our
country
so
long
as
a
willingness
of
the
foreign
lender
and
a
sufficient
export
of
our
productions
to
meet
any
necessary
partial
payments
leave
the
flow
of
credit
undisturbed
all
appears
to
be
prosperous
but
as
soon
as
it
is
checked
by
any
hesitation
abroad
or
by
an
inability
to
make
payment
there
in
our
productions
the
evils
of
the
system
are
disclosed
the
paper
currency
which
might
serve
for
domestic
purposes
is
useless
to
pay
the
debt
due
in
europe
gold
and
silver
are
therefore
drawn
in
exchange
for
their
notes
from
the
banks
to
keep
up
their
supply
of
coin
these
institutions
are
obliged
to
call
upon
their
own
debtors
who
pay
them
principally
in
their
own
notes
which
are
as
unavailable
to
them
as
they
are
to
the
merchants
to
meet
the
foreign
demand
the
calls
of
the
banks
therefore
in
such
emergencies
of
necessity
exceed
that
demand
and
produce
a
corresponding
curtailment
of
their
accommodations
and
of
the
currency
at
the
very
moment
when
the
state
of
trade
renders
it
most
inconvenient
to
be
borne
the
intensity
of
this
pressure
on
the
community
is
in
proportion
to
the
previous
liberality
of
credit
and
consequent
expansion
of
the
currency
forced
sales
of
property
are
made
at
the
time
when
the
means
of
purchasing
are
most
reduced
and
the
worst
calamities
to
individuals
are
only
at
last
arrested
by
an
open
violation
of
their
obligations
by
the
banksa
refusal
to
pay
specie
for
their
notes
and
an
imposition
upon
the
community
of
a
fluctuating
and
depreciated
currency
these
consequences
are
inherent
in
the
present
system
they
are
not
influenced
by
the
banks
being
large
or
small
created
by
national
or
state
governments
they
are
the
results
of
the
irresistible
laws
of
trade
or
credit
in
the
recent
events
which
have
so
strikingly
illustrated
the
certain
effects
of
these
laws
we
have
seen
the
bank
of
the
largest
capital
in
the
union
established
under
a
national
charter
and
lately
strengthened
as
we
were
authoritatively
informed
by
exchanging
that
for
a
state
charter
with
new
and
unusual
privilegesin
a
condition
too
as
it
was
said
of
entire
soundness
and
great
prosperitynot
merely
unable
to
resist
these
effects
but
the
first
to
yield
to
them
nor
is
it
to
be
overlooked
that
there
exists
a
chain
of
necessary
dependence
among
these
institutions
which
obliges
them
to
a
great
extent
to
follow
the
course
of
others
notwithstanding
its
injustice
to
their
own
immediate
creditors
or
injury
to
the
particular
community
in
which
they
are
placed
this
dependence
of
a
bank
which
is
in
proportion
to
the
extent
of
its
debts
for
circulation
and
deposits
is
not
merely
on
others
in
its
own
vicinity
but
on
all
those
which
connect
it
with
the
center
of
trade
distant
banks
may
fail
without
seriously
affecting
those
in
our
principal
commercial
cities
but
the
failure
of
the
latter
is
felt
at
the
extremities
of
the
union
the
suspension
at
new
york
in
was
everywhere
with
very
few
exceptions
followed
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
recently
at
philadelphia
immediately
affected
the
banks
of
the
south
and
west
in
a
similar
manner
this
dependence
of
our
whole
banking
system
on
the
institutions
in
a
few
large
cities
is
not
found
in
the
laws
of
their
organization
but
in
those
of
trade
and
exchange
the
banks
at
that
center
to
which
currency
flows
and
where
it
is
required
in
payments
for
merchandise
hold
the
power
of
controlling
those
in
regions
whence
it
comes
while
the
latter
possess
no
means
of
restraining
them
so
that
the
value
of
individual
property
and
the
prosperity
of
trade
through
the
whole
interior
of
the
country
are
made
to
depend
on
the
good
or
bad
management
of
the
banking
institutions
in
the
great
seats
of
trade
on
the
seaboard
but
this
chain
of
dependence
does
not
stop
here
it
does
not
terminate
at
philadelphia
or
new
york
it
reaches
across
the
ocean
and
ends
in
london
the
center
of
the
credit
system
the
same
laws
of
trade
which
give
to
the
banks
in
our
principal
cities
power
over
the
whole
banking
system
of
the
united
states
subject
the
former
in
their
turn
to
the
money
power
in
great
britain
it
is
not
denied
that
the
suspension
of
the
new
york
banks
in
which
was
followed
in
quick
succession
throughout
the
union
was
produced
by
an
application
of
that
power
and
it
is
now
alleged
in
extenuation
of
the
present
condition
of
so
large
a
portion
of
our
banks
that
their
embarrassments
have
arisen
from
the
same
cause
from
this
influence
they
can
not
now
entirely
escape
for
it
has
its
origin
in
the
credit
currencies
of
the
two
countries
it
is
strengthened
by
the
current
of
trade
and
exchange
which
centers
in
london
and
is
rendered
almost
irresistible
by
the
large
debts
contracted
there
by
our
merchants
our
banks
and
our
states
it
is
thus
that
an
introduction
of
a
new
bank
into
the
most
distant
of
our
villages
places
the
business
of
that
village
within
the
influence
of
the
money
power
in
england
it
is
thus
that
every
new
debt
which
we
contract
in
that
country
seriously
affects
our
own
currency
and
extends
over
the
pursuits
of
our
citizens
its
powerful
influence
we
can
not
escape
from
this
by
making
new
banks
great
or
small
state
or
national
the
same
chains
which
bind
those
now
existing
to
the
center
of
this
system
of
paper
credit
must
equally
fetter
every
similar
institution
we
create
it
is
only
by
the
extent
to
which
this
system
has
been
pushed
of
late
that
we
have
been
made
fully
aware
of
its
irresistible
tendency
to
subject
our
own
banks
and
currency
to
a
vast
controlling
power
in
a
foreign
lad
and
it
adds
a
new
argument
to
those
which
illustrate
their
precarious
situation
endangered
in
the
first
place
by
their
own
mismanagement
and
again
by
the
conduct
of
every
institution
which
connects
them
with
the
center
of
trade
in
our
own
country
they
are
yet
subjected
beyond
all
this
to
the
effect
of
whatever
measures
policy
necessity
or
caprice
may
induce
those
who
control
the
credits
of
england
to
resort
to
i
mean
not
to
comment
upon
these
measures
present
or
past
and
much
less
to
discourage
the
prosecution
of
fair
commercial
dealing
between
the
two
countries
based
on
reciprocal
benefits
but
it
having
now
been
made
manifest
that
the
power
of
inflicting
these
and
similar
injuries
is
by
the
resistless
law
of
a
credit
currency
and
credit
trade
equally
capable
of
extending
their
consequences
through
all
the
ramifications
of
our
banking
system
and
by
that
means
indirectly
obtaining
particularly
when
our
banks
are
used
as
depositories
of
the
public
moneys
a
dangerous
political
influence
in
the
united
states
i
have
deemed
it
my
duty
to
bring
the
subject
to
your
notice
and
ask
for
it
your
serious
consideration
is
an
argument
required
beyond
the
exposition
of
these
facts
to
show
the
impropriety
of
using
our
banking
institutions
as
depositories
of
the
public
money
can
we
venture
not
only
to
encounter
the
risk
of
their
individual
and
mutual
mismanagement
but
at
the
same
time
to
place
our
foreign
and
domestic
policy
entirely
under
the
control
of
a
foreign
moneyed
interest
to
do
so
is
to
impair
the
independence
of
our
government
as
the
present
credit
system
has
already
impaired
the
independence
of
our
banks
it
is
to
submit
all
its
important
operations
whether
of
peace
or
war
to
be
controlled
or
thwarted
at
first
by
our
own
banks
and
then
by
a
power

abroad
greater
than
themselves
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
depict
the
humiliation
to
which
this
government
and
people
might
be
sooner
or
later
reduced
if
the
means
for
defending
their
rights
are
to
be
made
dependent
upon
those
who
may
have
the
most
powerful
of
motives
to
impair
them
nor
is
it
only
in
reference
to
the
effect
of
this
state
of
things
on
the
independence
of
our
government
or
of
our
banks
that
the
subject
presents
itself
for
consideration
it
is
to
be
viewed
also
in
its
relations
to
the
general
trade
of
our
country
the
time
is
not
long
passed
when
a
deficiency
of
foreign
crops
was
thought
to
afford
a
profitable
market
for
the
surplus
of
our
industry
but
now
we
await
with
feverish
anxiety
the
news
of
the
english
harvest
not
so
much
from
motives
of
commendable
sympathy
but
fearful
lest
its
anticipated
failure
should
narrow
the
field
of
credit
there
does
not
this
speak
volumes
to
the
patriot
can
a
system
be
beneficent
wise
or
just
which
creates
greater
anxiety
for
interests
dependent
on
foreign
credit
than
for
the
general
prosperity
of
our
own
country
and
the
profitable
exportation
of
the
surplus
produce
of
our
labor
the
circumstances
to
which
i
have
thus
adverted
appear
to
me
to
afford
weighty
reasons
developed
by
late
events
to
be
added
to
those
which
i
have
on
former
occasions
offered
when
submitting
to
your
better
knowledge
and
discernment
the
propriety
of
separating
the
custody
of
the
public
money
from
banking
institutions
nor
has
anything
occurred
to
lessen
in
my
opinion
the
force
of
what
has
been
heretofore
urged
the
only
ground
on
which
that
custody
can
be
desired
by
the
banks
is
the
profitable
use
which
they
may
make
of
the
money
such
use
would
be
regarded
in
individuals
as
a
breach
of
trust
or
a
crime
of
great
magnitude
and
yet
it
may
be
reasonably
doubted
whether
first
and
last
it
is
not
attended
with
more
mischievous
consequences
when
permitted
to
the
former
than
to
the
latter
the
practice
of
permitting
the
public
money
to
be
used
by
its
keepers
as
here
is
believed
to
be
peculiar
to
this
country
and
to
exist
scarcely
anywhere
else
to
procure
it
here
improper
influences
are
appealed
to
unwise
connections
are
established
between
the
government
and
vast
numbers
of
powerful
state
institutions
other
motives
than
the
public
good
are
brought
to
bear
both
on
the
executive
and
legislative
departments
and
selfish
combinations
leading
to
special
legislation
are
formed
it
is
made
the
interest
of
banking
institutions
and
their
stockholders
throughout
the
union
to
use
their
exertions
for
the
increase
of
taxation
and
the
accumulation
of
a
surplus
revenue
and
while
an
excuse
is
afforded
the
means
are
furnished
for
those
excessive
issues
which
lead
to
extravagant
trading
and
speculation
and
are
the
forerunners
of
a
vast
debt
abroad
and
a
suspension
of
the
banks
at
home
impressed
therefore
as
i
am
with
the
propriety
of
the
funds
of
the
government
being
withdrawn
from
the
private
use
of
either
banks
or
individuals
and
the
public
money
kept
by
duly
appointed
public
agents
and
believing
as
i
do
that
such
also
is
the
judgment
which
discussion
reflection
and
experience
have
produced
on
the
public
mind
i
leave
the
subject
with
you
it
is
at
all
events
essential
to
the
interests
of
the
community
and
the
business
of
the
government
that
a
decision
should
be
made
most
of
the
arguments
that
dissuade
us
from
employing
banks
in
the
custody
and
disbursement
of
the
public
money
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
receipt
of
their
notes
for
public
dues
the
difference
is
only
in
form
in
one
instance
the
government
is
a
creditor
for
its
deposits
and
in
the
other
for
the
notes
it
holds
they
afford
the
same
opportunity
for
using
the
public
moneys
and
equally
lead
to
all
the
evils
attendant
upon
it
since
a
bank
can
as
safely
extend
its
discounts
on
a
deposit
of
its
notes
in
the
hands
of
a
public
officer
as
on
one
made
in
its
own
vaults
on
the
other
hand
it
would
give
to
the
government
no
greater
security
for
in
case
of
failure
the
claim
of
the
note
holder
would
be
no
better
than
that
of
a
depositor
i
am
aware
that
the
danger
of
inconvenience
to
the
public
and
unreasonable
pressure
upon
sound
banks
have
been
urged
as
objections
to
requiring
the
payment
of
the
revenue
in
gold
and
silver
these
objections
have
been
greatly
exaggerated
from
the
best
estimates
we
may
safely
fix
the
amount
of
specie
in
the
country
at
and
the
portion
of
that
which
would
be
employed
at
any
one
time
in
the
receipts
and
disbursements
of
the
government
even
if
the
proposed
change
were
made
at
once
would
not
it
is
now
after
fuller
investigation
believed
exceed
four
or
five
millions
if
the
change
were
gradual
several
years
would
elapse
before
that
sum
would
be
required
with
annual
opportunities
in
the
meantime
to
alter
the
law
should
experience
prove
it
to
be
oppressive
or
inconvenient
the
portions
of
the
community
on
whose
business
the
change
would
immediately
operate
are
comparatively
small
nor
is
it
believed
that
its
effect
would
be
in
the
least
unjust
or
injurious
to
them
in
the
payment
of
duties
which
constitute
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
the
revenue
a
very
large
proportion
is
derived
from
foreign
commission
houses
and
agents
of
foreign
manufacturers
who
sell
the
goods
consigned
to
them
generally
at
auction
and
after
paying
the
duties
out
of
the
avails
remit
the
rest
abroad
in
specie
or
its
equivalent
that
the
amount
of
duties
should
in
such
cases
be
also
retained
in
specie
can
hardly
be
made
a
matter
of
complaint
our
own
importing
merchants
by
whom
the
residue
of
the
duties
is
paid
are
not
only
peculiarly
interested
in
maintaining
a
sound
currency
which
the
measure
in
question
will
especially
promote
but
are
from
the
nature
of
their
dealings
best
able
to
know
when
specie
will
be
needed
and
to
procure
it
with
the
least
difficulty
or
sacrifice
residing
too
almost
universally
in
places
where
the
revenue
is
received
and
where
the
drafts
used
by
the
government
for
its
disbursements
must
concentrate
they
have
every
opportunity
to
obtain
and
use
them
in
place
of
specie
should
it
be
for
their
interest
or
convenience
of
the
number
of
these
drafts
and
the
facilities
they
may
afford
as
well
as
of
the
rapidity
with
which
the
public
funds
are
drawn
and
disbursed
an
idea
may
be
formed
from
the
fact
that
of
nearly
paid
to
collectors
and
receivers
during
the
present
year
the
average
amount
in
their
hands
at
any
one
time
has
not
exceeded
a
million
and
a
half
and
of
the
fifteen
millions
received
by
the
collector
of
new
york
alone
during
the
present
year
the
average
amount
held
by
him
subject
to
draft
during
each
week
has
been
less
than
half
a
million
the
ease
and
safety
of
the
operations
of
the
treasury
in
keeping
the
public
money
are
promoted
by
the
application
of
its
own
drafts
to
the
public
dues
the
objection
arising
from
having
them
too
long
outstanding
might
be
obviated
and
they
yet
made
to
afford
to
merchants
and
banks
holding
them
an
equivalent
for
specie
and
in
that
way
greatly
lessen
the
amount
actually
required
still
less
inconvenience
will
attend
the
requirement
of
specie
in
purchases
of
public
lands
such
purchases
except
when
made
on
speculation
are
in
general
but
single
transactions
rarely
repeated
by
the
same
person
and
it
is
a
fact
that
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
during
which
the
notes
of
sound
banks
have
been
received
more
than
a
moiety
of
these
payments
has
been
voluntarily
made
in
specie
being
a
larger
proportion
than
would
have
been
required
in
three
years
under
the
graduation
proposed
it
is
moreover
a
principle
than
which
none
is
better
settled
by
experience
that
the
supply
of
the
precious
metals
will
always
be
found
adequate
to
the
uses
for
which
they
are
required
they
abound
in
countries
where
no
other
currency
is
allowed
in
our
own
states
where
small
notes
are
excluded
gold
and
silver
supply
their
place
when
driven
to
their
hiding
places
by
bank
suspensions
a
little
firmness
in
the
community
soon
restores
them
in
a
sufficient
quantity
for
ordinary
purposes
postage
and
other
public
dues
have
been
collected
in
coin
without
serious
inconvenience
even
in
states
where
a
depreciated
paper
currency
has
existed
for
years
and
this
with
the
aid
of
treasury
notes
for
a
part
of
the
time
was
done
without
interruption
during
the
suspension
of
at
the
present
moment
the
receipts
and
disbursements
of
the
government
are
made
in
legal
currency
in
the
largest
portion
of
the
union
no
one
suggests
a
departure
from
this
rule
and
if
it
can
now
be
successfully
carried
out
it
will
be
surely
attended
with
even
less
difficulty
when
bank
notes
are
again
redeemed
in
specie
indeed
i
can
not
think
that
a
serious
objection
would
anywhere
be
raised
to
the
receipt
and
payment
of
gold
and
silver
in
all
public
transactions
were
it
not
from
an
apprehension
that
a
surplus
in
the
treasury
might
withdraw
a
large
portion
of
it
from
circulation
and
lock
it
up
unprofitably
in
the
public
vaults
it
would
not
in
my
opinion
be
difficult
to
prevent
such
an
inconvenience
from
occurring
but
the
authentic
statements
which
i
have
already
submitted
to
you
in
regard
to
the
actual
amount
in
the
public
treasury
at
any
one
time
during
the
period
embraced
in
them
and
the
little
probability
of
a
different
state
of
the
treasury
for
at
least
some
years
to
come
seem
to
render
it
unnecessary
to
dwell
upon
it
congress
moreover
as
i
have
before
observed
will
in
every
year
have
an
opportunity
to
guard
against
it
should
the
occurrence
of
any
circumstances
lead
us
to
apprehend
injury
from
this
source
viewing
the
subject
in
all
its
aspects
i
can
not
believe
that
any
period
will
be
more
auspicious
than
the
present
for
the
adoption
of
all
measures
necessary
to
maintain
the
sanctity
of
our
own
engagements
and
to
aid
in
securing
to
the
community
that
abundant
supply
of
the
precious
metals
which
adds
so
much
to
their
prosperity
and
gives
such
increased
stability
to
all
their
dealings
in
a
country
so
commercial
as
ours
banks
in
some
form
will
probably
always
exist
but
this
serves
only
to
render
it
the
more
incumbent
on
us
no
twithstanding
the
discouragements
of
the
past
to
strive
in
our
respective
stations
to
mitigate
the
evils
they
produce
to
take
from
them
as
rapidly
as
the
obligations
of
public
faith
and
a
careful
consideration
of
the
immediate
interests
of
the
community
will
permit
the
unjust
character
of
monopolies
to
check
so
far
as
may
be
practicable
by
prudent
legislation
those
temptations
of
interest
and
those
opportunities
for
their
dangerous
indulgence
which
beset
them
on
every
side
and
to
confine
them
strictly
to
the
performance
of
their
paramount
dutythat
of
aiding
the
operations
of
commerce
rather
than
consulting
their
own
exclusive
advantage
these
and
other
salutary
reforms
may
it
is
believed
be
accomplished
without
the
violation
of
any
of
the
great
principles
of
the
social
compact
the
observance
of
which
is
indispensable
to
its
existence
or
interfering
in
any
way
with
the
useful
and
profitable
employment
of
real
capital
institutions
so
framed
have
existed
and
still
exist
elsewhere
giving
to
commercial
intercourse
all
necessary
facilities
without
inflating
or
depreciating
the
currency
or
stimulating
speculation
thus
accomplishing
their
legitimate
ends
they
have
gained
the
surest
guaranty
for
their
protection
and
encouragement
in
the
good
will
of
the
community
among
a
people
so
just
as
ours
the
same
results
could
not
fail
to
attend
a
similar
course
the
direct
supervision
of
the
banks
belongs
from
the
nature
of
our
government
to
the
states
who
authorize
them
it
is
to
their
legislatures
that
the
people
must
mainly
look
for
action
on
that
subject
but
as
the
conduct
of
the
federal
government
in
the
management
of
its
revenue
has
also
a
powerful
though
less
immediate
influence
upon
them
it
becomes
our
duty
to
see
that
a
proper
direction
is
given
to
it
while
the
keeping
of
the
public
revenue
in
a
separate
and
independent
treasury
and
of
collecting
it
in
gold
and
silver
will
have
a
salutary
influence
on
the
system
of
paper
credit
with
which
all
banks
are
connected
and
thus
aid
those
that
are
sound
and
well
managed
it
will
at
the
same
time
sensibly
check
such
as
are
otherwise
by
at
once
withholding
the
means
of
extravagance
afforded
by
the
public
funds
and
restraining
them
from
excessive
issues
of
notes
which
they
would
be
constantly
called
upon
to
redeem
i
am
aware
it
has
been
urged
that
this
control
may
be
best
attained
and
exerted
by
means
of
a
national
bank
the
constitutional
objections
which
i
am
well
known
to
entertain
would
prevent
me
in
any
event
from
proposing
or
assenting
to
that
remedy
but
in
addition
to
this
i
can
not
after
past
experience
bring
myself
to
think
that
it
can
any
longer
be
extensively
regarded
as
effective
for
such
a
purpose
the
history
of
the
late
national
bank
through
all
its
mutations
shows
that
it
was
not
so
on
the
contrary
it
may
after
a
careful
consideration
of
the
subject
be
i
think
safely
stated
that
at
every
period
of
banking
excess
it
took
the
lead
that
in
and
in
in
and
in
its
vast
expansions
followed
by
distressing
contractions
led
to
those
of
the
state
institutions
it
swelled
and
maddened
the
tides
of
the
banking
system
but
seldom
allayed
or
safely
directed
them
at
a
few
periods
only
was
a
salutary
control
exercised
but
an
eager
desire
on
the
contrary
exhibited
for
profit
in
the
first
place
and
if
afterwards
its
measures
were
severe
toward
other
institutions
it
was
because
its
own
safety
compelled
it
to
adopt
them
it
did
not
differ
from
them
in
principle
or
in
form
its
measures
emanated
from
the
same
spirit
of
gain
it
felt
the
same
temptation
to
overissues
it
suffered
from
and
was
totally
unable
to
avert
those
inevitable
laws
of
trade
by
which
it
was
itself
affected
equally
with
them
and
at
least
on
one
occasion
at
an
early
day
it
was
saved
only
by
extraordinary
exertions
from
the
same
fate
that
attended
the
weakest
institution
it
professed
to
supervise
in
it
failed
equally
with
others
in
redeeming
its
notes
though
the
two
years
allowed
by
its
charter
for
that
purpose
had
not
expired
a
large
amount
of
which
remains
to
the
present
time
outstanding
it
is
true
that
having
so
vast
a
capital
and
strengthened
by
the
use
of
all
the
revenues
of
the
government
it
possessed
more
power
but
while
it
was
itself
by
that
circumstance
freed
from
the
control
which
all
banks
require
its
paramount
object
and
inducement
were
left
the
sameto
make
the
most
for
its
stockholders
not
to
regulate
the
currency
of
the
country
nor
has
it
as
far
as
we
are
advised
been
found
to
be
greatly
otherwise
elsewhere
the
national
character
given
to
the
bank
of
england
has
not
prevented
excessive
fluctuations
in
their
currency
and
it
proved
unable
to
keep
off
a
suspension
of
specie
payments
which
lasted
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
why
should
we
expect
it
to
be
otherwise
a
national
institution
though
deriving
its
charter
from
a
different
source
than
the
state
banks
is
yet
constituted
upon
the
same
principles
is
conducted
by
men
equally
exposed
to
temptation
and
is
liable
to
the
same
disasters
with
the
additional
disadvantage
that
its
magnitude
occasions
an
extent
of
confusion
and
distress
which
the
mismanagement
of
smaller
institutions
could
not
produce
it
can
scarcely
be
doubted
that
the
recent
suspension
of
the
united
state
bank
of
pennsylvania
of
which
the
effects
are
felt
not
in
that
state
alone
but
over
half
the
union
had
its
origin
in
a
course
of
business
commenced
while
it
was
a
national
institution
and
there
is
no
good
reason
for
supposing
that
the
same
consequences
would
not
have
followed
had
it
still
derived
its
powers
from
the
general
government
it
is
in
vain
when
the
influences
and
impulses
are
the
same
to
look
for
a
difference
in
conduct
or
results
by
such
creations
we
do
therefore
but
increase
the
mass
of
paper
credit
and
paper
currency
without
checking
their
attendant
evils
and
fluctuations
the
extent
of
power
and
the
efficiency
of
organization
which
we
give
so
far
from
being
beneficial
are
in
practice
positively
injurious
they
strengthen
the
chain
of
dependence
throughout
the
union
subject
all
parts
more
certainly
to
common
disaster
and
bind
every
bank
more
effectually
in
the
first
instance
to
those
of
our
commercial
cities
and
in
the
end
to
a
foreign
power
in
a
word
i
can
not
but
believe
that
with
the
full
understanding
of
the
operations
of
our
banking
system
which
experience
has
produced
public
sentiment
is
not
less
opposed
to
the
creation
of
a
national
bank
for
purposes
connected
with
currency
and
commerce
than
for
those
connected
with
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
yet
the
commerce
and
currency
of
the
country
are
suffering
evils
from
the
operations
of
the
state
banks
which
can
not
and
ought
not
to
be
overlooked
by
their
means
we
have
been
flooded
with
a
depreciated
paper
which
it
was
evidently
the
design
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
prevent
when
they
required
congress
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
of
foreign
coins
and
when
they
forbade
the
states
to
coin
money
emit
bills
of
credit
make
anything
but
gold
and
silver
a
tender
in
payment
of
debts
or
pass
any
law
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts
if
they
did
not
guard
more
explicitly
against
the
present
state
of
things
it
was
because
they
could
not
have
anticipated
that
the
few
banks
then
existing
were
to
swell
to
an
extent
which
would
expel
to
so
great
a
degree
the
gold
and
silver
for
which
they
had
provided
from
the
channels
of
circulation
and
fill
them
with
a
currency
that
defeats
the
objects
they
had
in
view
the
remedy
for
this
must
chiefly
rest
with
the
states
from
whose
legislation
it
has
sprung
no
good
that
might
accrue
in
a
particular
case
front
the
exercise
of
powers
not
obviously
conferred
on
the
general
government
would
authorize
its
interference
or
justify
a
course
that
might
in
the
slightest
degree
increase
at
the
expense
of
the
states
the
power
of
the
federal
authorities
nor
do
i
doubt
that
the
states
will
apply
the
remedy
within
the
last
few
years
events
have
appealed
to
them
too
strongly
to
be
disregarded
they
have
seen
that
the
constitution
though
theoretically
adhered
to
is
subverted
in
practice
that
while
on
the
statute
books
there
is
no
legal
tender
but
gold
and
silver
no
law
impairing
the
obligations
of
contracts
yet
that
in
point
of
fact
the
privileges
conferred
on
banking
corporations
have
made
their
notes
the
currency
of
the
country
that
the
obligations
imposed
by
these
notes
are
violated
under
the
impulses
of
interest
or
convenience
and
that
the
number
and
power
of
the
persons
connected
with
these
corporations
or
placed
under
their
influence
give
them
a
fearful
weight
when
their
interest
is
in
opposition
to
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
laws
to
the
people
it
is
immaterial
whether
these
results
are
produced
by
open
violations
of
the
latter
or
by
the
workings
of
a
system
of
which
the
result
is
the
same
an
inflexible
execution
even
of
the
existing
statutes
of
most
of
the
states
would
redress
many
evils
now
endured
would
effectually
show
the
banks
the
dangers
of
mismanagement
which
impunity
encourages
them
to
repeat
and
would
teach
all
corporations
the
useful
lesson
that
they
are
the
subjects
of
the
law
and
the
servants
of
the
people
what
is
still
wanting
to
effect
these
objects
must
be
sought
in
additional
legislation
or
if
that
be
inadequate
in
such
further
constitutional
grants
or
restrictions
as
may
bring
us
back
into
the
path
from
which
we
have
so
widely
wandered
in
the
meantime
it
is
the
duty
of
the
general
government
to
cooperate
with
the
states
by
a
wise
exercise
of
its
constitutional
powers
and
the
enforcement
of
its
existing
laws
the
extent
to
which
it
may
do
so
by
further
enactments
i
have
already
adverted
to
and
the
wisdom
of
congress
may
yet
enlarge
them
but
above
all
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
to
hold
erect
the
principles
of
morality
and
law
constantly
executing
our
own
contracts
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
thus
serving
as
a
rallying
point
by
which
our
whole
country
may
be
brought
back
to
that
safe
and
honored
standard
our
people
will
not
long
be
insensible
t
o
the
extent
of
the
burdens
entailed
upon
them
by
the
false
system
that
has
been
operating
on
their
sanguine
energetic
and
industrious
character
nor
to
the
means
necessary
to
extricate
themselves
from
these
embarrassments
the
weight
which
presses
upon
a
large
portion
of
the
people
and
the
states
is
an
enormous
debt
foreign
and
domestic
the
foreign
debt
of
our
states
corporations
and
men
of
business
can
scarcely
be
less
than
requiring
more
than
a
year
to
pay
the
interest
this
sum
has
to
be
paid
out
of
the
exports
of
the
country
and
must
of
necessity
cut
off
imports
to
that
extent
or
plunge
the
country
more
deeply
in
debt
from
year
to
year
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
increase
of
this
foreign
debt
must
augment
the
annual
demand
on
the
exports
to
pay
the
interest
and
to
the
same
extent
diminish
the
imports
and
in
proportion
to
the
enlargement
of
the
foreign
debt
and
the
consequent
increase
of
interest
must
be
the
decrease
of
the
import
trade
in
lieu
of
the
comforts
which
it
now
brings
us
we
might
have
our
gigantic
banking
institutions
and
splendid
but
in
many
instances
profitless
railroads
and
canals
absorbing
to
a
great
extent
in
interest
upon
the
capital
borrowed
to
construct
them
the
surplus
fruits
of
national
industry
for
years
to
come
and
securing
to
posterity
no
adequate
return
for
the
comforts
which
the
labors
of
their
hands
might
otherwise
have
secured
it
is
not
by
the
increase
of
this
debt
that
relief
is
to
be
sought
but
in
its
diminution
upon
this
point
there
is
i
am
happy
to
say
hope
before
us
not
so
much
in
the
return
of
confidence
abroad
which
will
enable
the
states
to
borrow
more
money
as
in
a
change
of
public
feeling
at
home
which
prompts
our
people
to
pause
in
their
career
and
think
of
the
means
by
which
debts
are
to
be
paid
before
they
are
contracted
if
we
would
escape
embarrassment
public
and
private
we
must
cease
to
run
in
debt
except
for
objects
of
necessity
or
such
as
will
yield
a
certain
return
let
the
faith
of
the
states
corporations
and
individuals
already
pledged
be
kept
with
the
most
punctilious
regard
it
is
due
to
our
national
character
as
well
as
to
justice
that
this
should
on
the
part
of
each
be
a
fixed
principle
of
conduct
but
it
behooves
us
all
to
be
more
chary
in
pledging
it
hereafter
by
ceasing
to
run
in
debt
and
applying
the
surplus
of
our
crops
and
incomes
to
the
discharge
of
existing
obligations
buying
less
and
selling
more
and
managing
all
affairs
public
and
private
with
strict
economy
and
frugality
we
shall
see
our
country
soon
recover
from
a
temporary
depression
arising
not
from
natural
and
permanent
causes
but
from
those
i
have
enumerated
and
advance
with
renewed
vigor
in
her
career
of
prosperity
fortunately
for
us
at
this
moment
when
the
balance
of
trade
is
greatly
against
us
and
the
difficulty
of
meeting
it
enhanced
by
the
disturbed
state
of
our
money
affairs
the
bounties
of
providence
have
come
to
relieve
us
from
the
consequences
of
past
errors
a
faithful
application
of
the
immense
results
of
the
labors
of
the
last
season
will
afford
partial
relief
for
the
present
and
perseverance
in
the
same
course
will
in
due
season
accomplish
the
rest
we
have
had
full
experience
in
times
past
of
the
extraordinary
results
which
can
in
this
respect
be
brought
about
in
a
short
period
by
the
united
and
welldirected
efforts
of
a
community
like
ours
our
surplus
profits
the
energy
and
industry
of
our
population
and
the
wonderful
advantages
which
providence
has
bestowed
upon
our
country
in
its
climate
its
various
productions
indispensable
to
other
nations
will
in
due
time
afford
abundant
means
to
perfect
the
most
useful
of
those
objects
for
which
the
states
have
been
plunging
themselves
of
late
in
embarrassment
and
debt
without
imposing
on
ourselves
or
our
children
such
fearful
burdens
but
let
it
be
indelibly
engraved
on
our
minds
that
relief
is
not
to
be
found
in
expedients
indebtedness
can
not
be
lessened
by
borrowing
more
money
or
by
changing
the
form
of
the
debt
the
balance
of
trade
is
not
to
be
turned
in
our
favor
by
creating
new
demands
upon
us
abroad
our
currency
can
not
be
improved
by
the
creation
of
new
banks
or
more
issues
from
those
which
now
exist
although
these
devices
sometimes
appear
to
give
temporary
relief
they
almost
invariably
aggravate
the
evil
in
the
end
it
is
only
by
retrenchment
and
reformby
curtailing
public
and
private
expenditures
by
paying
our
debts
and
by
reforming
our
banking
systemthat
we
are
to
expect
effectual
relief
security
for
the
future
and
an
enduring
prosperity
in
shaping
the
institutions
and
policy
of
the
general
government
so
as
to
promote
as
far
as
it
can
with
its
limited
powers
these
important
ends
you
may
rely
on
my
most
cordial
cooperation
that
there
should
have
been
in
the
progress
of
recent
events
doubts
in
many
quarters
and
in
some
a
heated
opposition
to
every
change
can
not
surprise
us
doubts
are
properly
attendant
on
all
reform
and
it
is
peculiarly
in
the
nature
of
such
abuses
as
we
are
now
encountering
to
seek
to
perpetuate
their
power
by
means
of
the
influence
they
have
been
permitted
to
acquire
it
is
their
result
if
not
their
object
to
gain
for
the
few
an
ascendency
over
the
many
by
securing
to
them
a
monopoly
of
the
currency
the
medium
through
which
most
of
the
wants
of
mankind
are
supplied
to
produce
throughout
society
a
chain
of
dependence
which
leads
all
classes
to
look
to
privileged
associations
for
the
means
of
speculation
and
extravagance
to
nourish
in
preference
to
the
manly
virtues
that
give
dignity
to
human
nature
a
craving
desire
for
luxurious
enjoyment
and
sudden
wealth
which
renders
those
who
seek
them
dependent
on
those
who
supply
them
to
substitute
for
republican
simplicity
and
economical
habits
a
sickly
appetite
for
effeminate
indulgence
and
an
imitation
of
that
reckless
extravagance
which
impoverished
and
enslaved
the
industrious
people
of
foreign
lands
and
at
last
to
fix
upon
us
instead
of
those
equal
political
rights
the
acquisition
of
which
was
alike
the
object
and
supposed
reward
of
our
revolutionary
struggle
a
system
of
exclusive
privileges
conferred
by
partial
legislation
to
remove
the
influences
which
had
thus
gradually
grown
up
among
us
to
deprive
them
of
their
deceptive
advantages
to
test
them
by
the
light
of
wisdom
and
truth
to
oppose
the
force
which
they
concentrate
in
their
supportall
this
was
necessarily
the
work
of
time
even
among
a
people
so
enlightened
and
pure
as
that
of
the
united
states
in
most
other
countries
perhaps
it
could
only
be
accomplished
through
that
series
of
revolutionary
movements
which
are
too
often
found
necessary
to
effect
any
great
and
radical
reform
but
it
is
the
crowning
merit
of
our
institutions
that
they
create
and
nourish
in
the
vast
majority
of
our
people
a
disposition
and
a
power
peaceably
to
remedy
abuses
which
have
elsewhere
caused
the
effusion
of
rivers
of
blood
and
the
sacrifice
of
thousands
of
the
human
race
the
result
thus
far
is
most
honorable
to
the
selfdenial
the
intelligence
and
the
patriotism
of
our
citizens
it
justifies
the
confident
hope
that
they
will
carry
through
the
reform
which
has
been
so
well
begun
and
that
they
will
go
still
further
than
they
have
yet
gone
in
illustrating
the
important
truth
that
a
people
as
free
and
enlightened
as
ours
will
whenever
it
becomes
necessary
show
themselves
to
be
indeed
capable
of
selfgovernment
by
voluntarily
adopting
appropriate
remedies
for
every
abuse
and
submitting
to
temporary
sacrifices
however
great
to
insure
their
permanent
welfare
my
own
exertions
for
the
furtherance
of
these
desirable
objects
have
been
bestowed
throughout
my
official
career
with
a
zeal
that
is
nourished
by
ardent
wishes
for
the
welfare
of
my
country
and
by
an
unlimited
reliance
on
the
wisdom
that
marks
its
ultimate
decision
on
all
great
and
controverted
questions
impressed
with
the
solemn
obligations
imposed
upon
me
by
the
constitution
desirous
also
of
laying
before
my
fellowcitizens
with
whose
confidence
and
support
i
have
been
so
highly
honored
such
measures
as
appear
to
me
conducive
to
their
prosperity
and
anxious
to
submit
to
their
fullest
consideration
the
grounds
upon
which
my
opinions
are
formed
i
have
on
this
as
on
preceding
occasions
freely
offered
my
views
on
those
points
of
domestic
policy
that
seem
at
the
present
time
most
prominently
to
require
the
action
of
the
government
i
know
that
they
will
receive
from
congress
that
full
and
able
consideration
which
the
importance
of
the
subjects
merits
and
i
can
repeat
the
assurance
heretofore
made
that
i
shall
cheerfully
and
readily
cooperate
with
you
in
every
measure
that
will
tend
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the

m

fellowcitizens

i
congratulate
you
on
the
favorable
circumstances
in
the
condition
of
our
country
under
which
you
reassemble
for
the
performance
of
your
official
duties
though
the
anticipations
of
an
abundant
harvest
have
not
everywhere
been
realized
yet
on
the
whole
the
labors
of
the
husbandman
are
rewarded
with
a
bountiful
return
industry
prospers
in
its
various
channels
of
business
and
enterprise
general
health
again
prevails
through
our
vast
diversity
of
climate
nothing
threatens
from
abroad
the
continuance
of
external
peace
nor
has
anything
at
home
impaired
the
strength
of
those
fraternal
and
domestic
ties
which
constitute
the
only
guaranty
to
the
success
and
permanency
of
our
happy
union
and
which
formed
in
the
hour
of
peril
have
hitherto
been
honorably
sustained
through
every
vicissitude
in
our
national
affairs
these
blessings
which
evince
the
care
and
beneficence
of
providence
call
for
our
devout
and
fervent
gratitude
we
have
not
less
reason
to
be
grateful
for
other
bounties
bestowed
by
the
same
munificent
hand
and
more
exclusively
our
own
the
present
year
closes
the
first
half
century
of
our
federal
institutions
and
our
system
differing
from
all
others
in
the
acknowledged
practical
and
unlimited
operation
which
it
has
for
so
long
a
period
given
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
has
now
been
fully
tested
by
experience
the
constitution
devised
by
our
forefathers
as
the
framework
and
bond
of
that
system
then
untried
has
become
a
settled
form
of
government
not
only
preserving
and
protecting
the
great
principles
upon
which
it
was
rounded
but
wonderfully
promoting
individual
happiness
and
private
interests
though
subject
to
change
and
entire
revocation
whenever
deemed
inadequate
to
all
these
purposes
yet
such
is
the
wisdom
of
its
construction
and
so
stable
has
been
the
public
sentiment
that
it
remains
unaltered
except
in
matters
of
detail
comparatively
unimportant
it
has
proved
amply
sufficient
for
the
various
emergencies
incident
to
our
condition
as
a
nation
a
formidable
foreign
war
agitating
collisions
between
domestic
and
in
some
respects
rival
sovereignties
temptations
to
interfere
in
the
intestine
commotions
of
neighboring
countries
the
dangerous
influences
that
arise
in
periods
of
excessive
prosperity
and
the
antirepublican
tendencies
of
associated
wealththese
with
other
trials
not
less
formidable
have
all
been
encountered
and
thus
far
successfully
resisted
it
was
reserved
for
the
american
union
to
test
the
advantages
of
a
government
entirely
dependent
on
the
continual
exercise
of
the
popular
will
and
our
experience
has
shown
that
it
is
as
beneficent
in
practice
as
it
is
just
in
theory
each
successive
change
made
in
our
local
institutions
has
contributed
to
extend
the
right
of
suffrage
has
increased
the
direct
influence
of
the
mass
of
the
community
given
greater
freedom
to
individual
exertion
and
restricted
more
and
more
the
powers
of
government
yet
the
intelligence
prudence
and
patriotism
of
the
people
have
kept
pace
with
this
augmented
responsibility
in
no
country
has
education
been
so
widely
diffused
domestic
peace
has
nowhere
so
largely
reigned
the
close
bonds
of
social
intercourse
have
in
no
instance
prevailed
with
such
harmony
over
a
space
so
vast
all
forms
of
religion
have
united
for
the
first
time
to
diffuse
charity
and
piety
because
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
nations
all
have
been
totally
untrammeled
and
absolutely
free
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
wilderness
have
been
penetrated
yet
instead
of
the
rudeness
in
the
social
condition
consequent
upon
such
adventures
elsewhere
numerous
communities
have
sprung
up
already
unrivaled
in
prosperity
general
intelligence
internal
tranquillity
and
the
wisdom
of
their
political
institutions
internal
improvement
the
fruit
of
individual
enterprise
fostered
by
the
protection
of
the
states
has
added
new
links
to
the
confederation
and
fresh
rewards
to
provident
industry
doubtful
questions
of
domestic
policy
have
been
quietly
settled
by
mutual
forbearance
and
agriculture
commerce
and
manufactures
minister
to
each
other
taxation
and
public
debt
the
burdens
which
bear
so
heavily
upon
all
other
countries
have
pressed
with
comparative
lightness
upon
us
without
one
entangling
alliance
our
friendship
is
prized
by
every
nation
and
the
rights
of
our
citizens
are
everywhere
respected
because
they
are
known
to
be
guarded
by
a
united
sensitive
and
watchful
people
to
this
practical
operation
of
our
institutions
so
evident
and
successful
we
owe
that
increased
attachment
to
them
which
is
among
the
most
cheering
exhibitions
of
popular
sentiment
and
will
prove
their
best
security
in
time
to
come
against
foreign
or
domestic
assault
this
review
of
the
results
of
our
institutions
for
half
a
century
without
exciting
a
spirit
of
vain
exultation
should
serve
to
impress
upon
us
the
great
principles
from
which
they
have
sprungconstant
and
direct
supervision
by
the
people
over
every
public
measure
strict
forbearance
on
the
part
of
the
government
from
exercising
any
doubtful
or
disputed
powers
and
a
cautious
abstinence
from
all
interference
with
concerns
which
properly
belong
and
are
best
left
to
state
regulations
and
individual
enterprise
full
information
of
the
state
of
our
foreign
affairs
having
been
recently
on
different
occasions
submitted
to
congress
i
deem
it
necessary
now
to
bring
to
your
notice
only
such
events
as
have
subsequently
occurred
or
are
of
such
importance
as
to
require
particular
attention
the
most
amicable
dispositions
continue
to
be
exhibited
by
all
the
nations
with
whom
the
government
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
an
habitual
intercourse
at
the
date
of
my
last
annual
message
mexico
was
the
only
nation
which
could
not
be
included
in
so
gratifying
a
reference
to
our
foreign
relations
i
am
happy
to
be
now
able
to
inform
you
that
an
advance
has
been
made
toward
the
adjustment
of
our
differences
with
that
republic
and
the
restoration
of
the
customary
good
feeling
between
the
two
nations
this
important
change
has
been
effected
by
conciliatory
negotiations
that
have
resulted
in
the
conclusion
of
a
treaty
between
the
two
governments
which
when
ratified
will
refer
to
the
arbitrament
of
a
friendly
power
all
the
subjects
of
controversy
between
us
growing
out
of
injuries
to
individuals
there
is
at
present
also
reason
to
believe
that
an
equitable
settlement
of
all
disputed
points
will
be
attained
without
further
difficulty
or
unnecessary
delay
and
thus
authorize
the
free
resumption
of
diplomatic
intercourse
with
our
sister
republic
with
respect
to
the
northeastern
boundary
of
the
united
states
no
official
correspondence
between
this
government
and
that
of
great
britain
has
passed
since
that
communicated
to
congress
toward
the
close
of
their
last
session
the
offer
to
negotiate
a
convention
for
the
appointment
of
a
joint
commission
of
survey
and
exploration
i
am
however
assured
will
be
met
by
her
majestys
government
in
a
conciliatory
and
friendly
spirit
and
instructions
to
enable
the
british
minister
here
to
conclude
such
an
arrangement
will
be
transmitted
to
him
without
needless
delay
it
is
hoped
and
expected
that
these
instructions
will
be
of
a
liberal
character
and
that
this
negotiation
if
successful
will
prove
to
be
an
important
step
toward
the
satisfactory
and
final
adjustment
of
the
controversy
i
had
hoped
that
the
respect
for
the
laws
and
regard
for
the
peace
and
honor
of
their
own
country
which
have
ever
characterized
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
would
have
prevented
any
portion
of
them
from
using
any
means
to
promote
insurrection
in
the
territory
of
a
power
with
which
we
are
at
peace
and
with
which
the
united
states
are
desirous
of
maintaining
the
most
friendly
relations
i
regret
deeply
however
to
be
obliged
to
inform
you
that
this
has
not
been
the
case
information
has
been
given
to
me
derived
from
official
and
other
sources
that
many
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
associated
together
to
make
hostile
incursions
from
our
territory
into
canada
and
to
aid
and
abet
insurrection
there
in
violation
of
the
obligations
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
in
open
disregard
of
their
own
duties
as
citizens
this
information
has
been
in
part
confirmed
by
a
hostile
invasion
actually
made
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
conjunction
with
canadians
and
others
and
accompanied
by
a
forcible
seizure
of
the
property
of
our
citizens
and
an
application
thereof
to
the
prosecution
of
military
operations
against
the
authorities
and
people
of
canada
the
results
of
these
criminal
assaults
upon
the
peace
and
order
of
a
neighboring
country
have
been
as
was
to
be
expected
fatally
destructive
to
the
misguided
or
deluded
persons
engaged
in
them
and
highly
injurious
to
those
in
whose
behalf
they
are
professed
to
have
been
undertaken
the
authorities
in
canada
from
intelligence
received
of
such
intended
movements
among
our
citizens
have
felt
themselves
obliged
to
take
precautionary
measures
against
them
have
actually
embodied
the
militia
and
assumed
an
attitude
to
repel
the
invasion
to
which
they
believed
the
colonies
were
exposed
from
the
united
states
a
state
of
feeling
on
both
sides
of
the
frontier
has
thus
been
produced
which
called
for
prompt
and
vigorous
interference
if
an
insurrection
existed
in
canada
the
amicable
dispositions
of
the
united
states
toward
great
britain
as
well
as
their
duty
to
themselves
would
lead
them
to
maintain
a
strict
neutrality
and
to
restrain
their
citizens
from
all
violations
of
the
laws
which
have
been
passed
for
its
enforcement
but
this
government
recognizes
a
still
higher
obligation
to
repress
all
attempts
on
the
part
of
its
citizens
to
disturb
the
peace
of
a
country
where
order
prevails
or
has
been
reestablished
depredations
by
our
citizens
upon
nations
at
peace
with
the
united
states
or
combinations
for
committing
them
have
at
all
times
been
regarded
by
the
american
government
and
people
with
the
greatest
abhorrence
military
incursions
by
our
citizens
into
countries
so
situated
and
the
commission
o
f
acts
of
violence
on
the
members
thereof
in
order
to
effect
a
change
in
their
government
or
under
any
pretext
whatever
have
from
the
commencement
of
our
government
been
held
equally
criminal
on
the
part
of
those
engaged
in
them
and
as
much
deserving
of
punishment
as
would
be
the
disturbance
of
the
public
peace
by
the
perpetration
of
similar
acts
within
our
own
territory
by
no
country
or
persons
have
these
invaluable
principles
of
international
lawprinciples
the
strict
observance
of
which
is
so
indispensable
to
the
preservation
of
social
order
in
the
worldbeen
more
earnestly
cherished
or
sacredly
respected
than
by
those
great
and
good
men
who
first
declared
and
finally
established
the
independence
of
our
own
country
they
promulgated
and
maintained
them
at
an
early
and
critical
period
in
our
history
they
were
subsequently
embodied
in
legislative
enactments
of
a
highly
penal
character
the
faithful
enforcement
of
which
has
hitherto
been
and
will
i
trust
always
continue
to
be
regarded
as
a
duty
inseparably
associated
with
the
maintenance
of
our
national
honor
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
should
feel
an
interest
in
the
spread
of
political
institutions
as
free
as
they
regard
their
own
to
be
is
natural
nor
can
a
sincere
solicitude
for
the
success
of
all
those
who
are
at
any
time
in
good
faith
struggling
for
their
acquisition
be
imputed
to
our
citizens
as
a
crime
with
the
entire
freedom
of
opinion
and
an
undisguised
expression
thereof
on
their
part
the
government
has
neither
the
right
nor
i
trust
the
disposition
to
interfere
but
whether
the
interest
or
the
honor
of
the
united
states
requires
that
they
should
be
made
a
party
to
any
such
struggle
and
by
inevitable
consequence
to
the
war
which
is
waged
in
its
support
is
a
question
which
by
our
constitution
is
wisely
left
to
congress
alone
to
decide
it
is
by
the
laws
already
made
criminal
in
our
citizens
to
embarrass
or
anticipate
that
decision
by
unauthorized
military
operations
on
their
part
offenses
of
this
character
in
addition
to
their
criminality
as
violations
of
the
laws
of
our
country
have
a
direct
tendency
to
draw
down
upon
our
own
citizens
at
large
the
multiplied
evils
of
a
foreign
war
and
expose
to
injurious
imputations
the
good
faith
and
honor
of
the
country
as
such
they
deserve
to
be
put
down
with
promptitude
and
decision
i
can
not
be
mistaken
i
am
confident
in
counting
on
the
cordial
and
general
concurrence
of
our
fellowcitizens
in
this
sentiment
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
which
i
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
issue
is
herewith
communicated
i
can
not
but
hope
that
the
good
sense
and
patriotism
the
regard
for
the
honor
and
reputation
of
their
country
the
respect
for
the
laws
which
they
have
themselves
enacted
for
their
own
government
and
the
love
of
order
for
which
the
mass
of
our
people
have
been
so
long
and
so
justly
distinguished
will
deter
the
comparatively
few
who
are
engaged
in
them
from
a
further
prosecution
of
such
desperate
enterprises
in
the
meantime
the
existing
laws
have
been
and
will
continue
to
be
faithfully
executed
and
every
effort
will
be
made
to
carry
them
out
in
their
full
extent
whether
they
are
sufficient
or
not
to
meet
the
actual
state
of
things
on
the
canadian
frontier
it
is
for
congress
to
decide
it
will
appear
from
the
correspondence
herewith
submitted
that
the
government
of
russia
declines
a
renewal
of
the
fourth
article
of
the
convention
of
april
between
the
united
states
and
his
imperial
majesty
by
the
third
article
of
which
it
is
agreed
that
hereafter
there
shall
not
be
formed
by
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
under
the
authority
of
the
said
states
any
establishment
upon
the
northwest
coast
of
america
nor
in
any
of
the
islands
adjacent
to
the
north
of
of
north
latitude
and
that
in
the
same
manner
there
shall
be
none
formed
by
russian
subjects
or
under
the
authority
of
russia
south
of
the
same
parallel
and
by
the
fourth
article
that
during
a
term
of
ten
years
counting
from
the
signature
of
the
present
convention
the
ships
of
both
powers
or
which
belong
to
their
citizens
or
subjects
respectively
may
reciprocally
frequent
without
any
hindrance
whatever
the
interior
seas
gulfs
harbors
and
creeks
upon
the
coast
mentioned
in
the
preceding
article
for
the
purpose
of
fishing
and
trading
with
the
natives
of
the
country
the
reasons
assigned
for
declining
to
renew
the
provisions
of
this
article
are
briefly
that
the
only
use
made
by
our
citizens
of
the
privileges
it
secures
to
them
has
been
to
supply
the
indians
with
spirituous
liquors
ammunition
and
firearms
that
this
traffic
has
been
excluded
from
the
russian
trade
and
as
the
supplies
furnished
from
the
united
states
are
injurious
to
the
russian
establishments
on
the
northwest
coast
and
calculated
to
produce
complaints
between
the
two
governments
his
imperial
majesty
thinks
it
for
the
interest
of
both
countries
not
to
accede
to
the
proposition
made
by
the
american
government
for
the
renewal
of
the
article
last
referred
to
the
correspondence
herewith
communicated
will
show
the
grounds
upon
which
we
contend
that
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
independent
of
the
provisions
of
the
convention
of
a
right
to
trade
with
the
natives
upon
the
coast
in
question
at
unoccupied
places
liable
however
it
is
admitted
to
be
at
any
time
extinguished
by
the
creation
of
russian
establishments
at
such
points
this
right
is
denied
by
the
russian
government
which
asserts
that
by
the
operation
of
the
treaty
of
each
party
agreed
to
waive
the
general
right
to
land
on
the
vacant
coasts
on
the
respective
sides
of
the
degree
of
latitude
referred
to
and
accepted
in
lieu
thereof
the
mutual
privileges
mentioned
in
the
fourth
article
the
capital
and
tonnage
employed
by
our
citizens
in
their
trade
with
the
northwest
coast
of
america
will
perhaps
on
adverting
to
the
official
statements
of
the
commerce
and
navigation
of
the
united
states
for
the
last
few
years
be
deemed
too
inconsiderable
in
amount
to
attract
much
attention
yet
the
subject
may
in
other
respects
deserve
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
i
regret
to
state
that
the
blockade
of
the
principal
ports
on
the
eastern
coast
of
mexico
which
in
consequence
of
differences
between
that
republic
and
france
was
instituted
in
may
last
unfortunately
still
continues
enforced
by
a
competent
french
naval
armament
and
is
necessarily
embarrassing
to
our
own
trade
in
the
gulf
in
common
with
that
of
other
nations
every
disposition
however
is
believed
to
exist
on
the
part
of
the
french
government
to
render
this
measure
as
little
onerous
as
practicable
to
the
interests
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
to
those
of
neutral
commerce
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
an
early
settlement
of
the
difficulties
between
france
and
mexico
will
soon
reestablish
the
harmonious
relations
formerly
subsisting
between
them
and
again
open
the
ports
of
that
republic
to
the
vessels
of
all
friendly
nations
a
convention
for
marking
that
part
of
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
texas
which
extends
from
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
to
the

river
was
concluded
and
signed
at
this
city
on
the
th
of
april
last
it
has
since
been
ratified
by
both
governments
and
seasonable
measures
will
be
taken
to
carry
it
into
effect
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
the
application
of
that
republic
for
admission
into
this
union
made
in
august
and
which
was
declined
for
reasons
already
made
known
to
you
has
been
formally
withdrawn
as
will
appear
from
the

confederation
the
ratifications
of
which
have
been
recently
exchanged

this
message
for
the
information
of
congress
and
for
such
legislative
enactments
as
may
be
found
necessary
or
expedient
in
relation
to
either
of
them
to
watch
over
and
foster
the
interests
of
a
gradually
increasing
and
widely
extended
commerce
to
guard
the
rights
of
american
citizens
whom
business
or
pleasure
or
other
motives
may
tempt
into
distant
climes
and
at
the
same
time
to
cultivate
those
sentiments
of
mutual
respect
and
good
will
which
experience
has
proved
so
beneficial
in
international
intercourse
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
deemed
it
expedient
from
time
to
time
to
establish
diplomatic
connections
with
different
foreign
states
by
the
appointment
of
representatives
to
reside
within
their
respective
territories
i
am
gratified
to
be
enabled
to
announce
to
you
that
since
the
close
of
your
last
session
these
relations
have
been
opened
under
the
happiest
auspices
with
austria
and
the
two
sicilies
that
new
nominations
have
been
made
in
the
respective
missions
of
russia
brazil
belgium
and
sweden
and
norway
in
this
country
and
that
a
minister
extraordinary
has
been
received
accredited
to
this
government
from
the
argentine
confederation
an
exposition
of
the
fiscal
affairs
of
the
government
and
of
their
condition
for
the
past
year
will
be
made
to
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
available
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
january
next
is
estimated
at
the
receipts
of
the
year
from
customs
and
lands
will
probably
amount
to
these
usual
sources
of
revenue
have
been
increased
by
an
issue
of
treasury
notes
of
which
less
than
including
interest
and
principal
will
be
outstanding
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
by
the
sale
of
one
of
the
bonds
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
for
the
aggregate
of
means
from
these
and
other
sources
with
the
balance
on
hand
on
the
st
of
january
last
has
been
applied
to
the
payment
of
appropriations
by
congress
the
whole
expenditure
for
the
year
on
their
account
including
the
redemption
of
more
than
eight
millions
of
treasury
notes
constitutes
an
aggregate
of
about
and
will
still
leave
in
the
treasury
the
balance
before
stated
nearly
of
treasury
notes
are
to
be
paid
during
the
coming
y
ear
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
appropriations
for
the
support
of
government
for
both
these
purposes
the
resources
of
the
treasury
will
undoubtedly
be
sufficient
if
the
charges
upon
it
are
not
increased
beyond
the
annual
estimates
no
excess
however
is
likely
to
exist
nor
can
the
postponed
installment
of
the
surplus
revenue
be
deposited
with
the
states
nor
any
considerable
appropriations
beyond
the
estimates
be
made
without
causing
a
deficiency
in
the
treasury
the
great
caution
advisable
at
all
times
of
limiting
appropriations
to
the
wants
of
the
public
service
is
rendered
necessary
at
present
by
the
prospective
and
rapid
reduction
of
the
tariff
while
the
vigilant
jealousy
evidently
excited
among
the
people
by
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
years
assures
us
that
they
expect
from
their
representatives
and
will
sustain
them
in
the
exercise
of
the
most
rigid
economy
much
can
be
effected
by
postponing
appropriations
not
immediately
required
for
the
ordinary
public
service
or
for
any
pressing
emergency
and
much
by
reducing
the
expenditures
where
the
entire
and
immediate
accomplishment
of
the
objects
in
view
is
not
indispensable
when
we
call
to
mind
the
recent
and
extreme
embarrassments
produced
by
excessive
issues
of
bank
paper
aggravated
by
the
unforeseen
withdrawal
of
much
foreign
capital
and
the
inevitable
derangement
arising
from
the
distribution
of
the
surplus
revenue
among
the
states
as
required
by
congress
and
consider
the
heavy
expenses
incurred
by
the
removal
of
indian
tribes
by
the
military
operations
in
florida
and
on
account
of
the
unusually
large
appropriations
made
at
the
last
two
annual
sessions
of
congress
for
other
objects
we
have
striking
evidence
in
the
present
efficient
state
of
our
finances
of
the
abundant
resources
of
the
country
to
fulfill
all
its
obligations
nor
is
it
less
gratifying
to
find
that
the
general
business
of
the
community
deeply
affected
as
it
has
been
is
reviving
with
additional
vigor
chastened
by
the
lessons
of
the
past
and
animated
by
the
hopes
of
the
future
by
the
curtailment
of
paper
issues
by
curbing
the
sanguine
and
adventurous
spirit
of
speculation
and
by
the
honorable
application
of
all
available
means
to
the
fulfillment
of
obligations
confidence
has
been
restored
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
ease
and
facility
secured
to
all
the
operations
of
trade
the
agency
of
the
government
in
producing
these
results
has
been
as
efficient
as
its
powers
and
means
permitted
by
withholding
from
the
states
the
deposit
of
the
fourth
installment
and
leaving
several
millions
at
long
credits
with
the
banks
principally
in
one
section
of
the
country
and
more
immediately
beneficial
to
it
and
at
the
same
time
aiding
the
banks
and
commercial
communities
in
other
sections
by
postponing
the
payment
of
bonds
for
duties
to
the
amount
of
between
four
and
five
millions
of
dollars
by
an
issue
of
treasury
notes
as
a
means
to
enable
the
government
to
meet
the
consequences
of
their
indulgences
but
affording
at
the
same
time
facilities
for
remittance
and
exchange
and
by
steadily
declining
to
employ
as
general
depositories
of
the
public
revenues
or
receive
the
notes
of
all
banks
which
refused
to
redeem
them
with
specieby
these
measures
aided
by
the
favorable
action
of
some
of
the
banks
and
by
the
support
and
cooperation
of
a
large
portion
of
the
community
we
have
witnessed
an
early
resumption
of
specie
payments
in
our
great
commercial
capital
promptly
followed
in
almost
every
part
of
the
united
states
this
result
has
been
alike
salutary
to
the
true
interests
of
agriculture
commerce
and
manufactures
to
public
morals
respect
for
the
laws
and
that
confidence
between
man
and
man
which
is
so
essential
in
all
our
social
relations
the
contrast
between
the
suspension
of
and
that
of
is
most
striking
the
short
duration
of
the
latter
the
prompt
restoration
of
business
the
evident
benefits
resulting
from
an
adherence
by
the
government
to
the
constitutional
standard
of
value
instead
of
sanctioning
the
suspension
by
the
receipt
of
irredeemable
paper
and
the
advantages
derived
from
the
large
amount
of
specie
introduced
into
the
country
previous
to
afford
a
valuable
illustration
of
the
true
policy
of
the
government
in
such
a
crisis
nor
can
the
comparison
fail
to
remove
the
impression
that
a
national
bank
is
necessary
in
such
emergencies
not
only
were
specie
payments
resumed
without
its
aid
but
exchanges
have
also
been
more
rapidly
restored
than
when
it
existed
thereby
showing
that
private
capital
enterprise
and
prudence
are
fully
adequate
to
these
ends
on
all
these
points
experience
seems
to
have
confirmed
the
views
heretofore
submitted
to
congress
we
have
been
saved
the
mortification
of
seeing
the
distresses
of
the
community
for
the
third
time
seized
on
to
fasten
upon
the
country
so
dangerous
an
institution
and
we
may
also
hope
that
the
business
of
individuals
will
hereafter
be
relieved
from
the
injurious
effects
of
a
continued
agitation
of
that
disturbing
subject
the
limited
influence
of
a
national
bank
in
averting
derangement
in
the
exchanges
of
the
country
or
in
compelling
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
is
now
not
less
apparent
than
its
tendency
to
increase
inordinate
speculation
by
sudden
expansions
and
contractions
its
disposition
to
create
panic
and
embarrassment
for
the
promotion
of
its
own
designs
its
interference
with
politics
and
its
far
greater
power
for
evil
than
for
good
either
in
regard
to
the
local
institutions
or
the
operations
of
government
itself
what
was
in
these
respects
but
apprehension
or
opinion
when
a
national
bank
was
first
established
now
stands
confirmed
by
humiliating
experience
the
scenes
through
which
we
have
passed
conclusively
prove
how
little
our
commerce
agriculture
manufactures
or
finances
require
such
an
institution
and
what
dangers
are
attendant
on
its
powera
power
i
trust
never
to
be
conferred
by
the
american
people
upon
their
government
and
still
less
upon
individuals
not
responsible
to
them
for
its
unavoidable
abuses
my
conviction
of
the
necessity
of
further
legislative
provisions
for
the
safekeeping
and
disbursement
of
the
public
moneys
and
my
opinion
in
regard
to
the
measures
best
adapted
to
the
accomplishment
of
those
objects
have
been
already
submitted
to
you
these
have
been
strengthened
by
recent
events
and
in
the
full
conviction
that
time
and
experience
must
still
further
demonstrate
their
propriety
i
feel
it
my
duty
with
respectful
deference
to
the
conflicting
views
of
others
again
to
invite
your
attention
to
them
with
the
exception
of
limited
sums
deposited
in
the
few
banks
still
employed
under
the
act
of
the
amounts
received
for
duties
and
with
very
inconsiderable
exceptions
those
accruing
from
lands
also
have
since
the
general
suspension
of
specie
payments
by
the
deposit
banks
been
kept
and
disbursed
by
the
treasurer
under
his
general
legal
powers
subject
to
the
superintendence
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
propriety
of
defining
more
specifically
and
of
regulating
by
law
the
exercise
of
this
wide
scope
of
executive
discretion
has
been
already
submitted
to
congress
a
change
in
the
office
of
collector
at
one
of
our
principal
ports
has
brought
to
light
a
defalcation
of
the
gravest
character
the
particulars
of
which
will
be
laid
before
you
in
a
special
report
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
by
his
report
and
the
accompanying
documents
it
will
be
seen
that
the
weekly
returns
of
the
defaulting
officer
apparently
exhibited
throughout
a
faithful
administration
of
the
affairs
intrusted
to
his
management
it
however
now
appears
that
he
commenced
abstracting
the
public
moneys
shortly
after
his
appointment
and
continued
to
do
so
progressively
increasing
the
amount
for
the
term
of
more
than
seven
years
embracing
a
portion
of
the
period
during
which
the
public
moneys
were
deposited
in
the
bank
of
the
united
states
the
whole
of
that
of
the
state
bank
deposit
system
and
concluding
only
on
his
retirement
from
office
after
that
system
had
substantially
failed
in
consequence
of
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
the
way
in
which
this
defalcation
was
so
long
concealed
and
the
steps
taken
to
indemnify
the
united
states
as
far
as
practicable
against
loss
will
also
be
presented
to
you
the
case
is
one
which
imperatively
claims
the
attention
of
congress
and
furnishes
the
strongest
motive
for
the
establishment
of
a
more
severe
and
secure
system
for
the
safekeeping
and
disbursement
of
the
public
moneys
than
any
that
has
heretofore
existed
it
seems
proper
at
all
events
that
by
an
early
enactment
similar
to
that
of
other
countries
the
application
of
public
money
by
an
officer
of
government
to
private
uses
should
be
made
a
felony
and
visited
with
severe
and
ignominious
punishment
this
is
already
in
effect
the
law
in
respect
to
the
mint
and
has
been
productive
of
the
most
salutary
results
whatever
system
is
adopted
such
an
enactment
would
be
wise
as
an
independent
measure
since
much
of
the
public
moneys
must
in
their
collection
and
ultimate
disbursement
pass
twice
through
the
hands
of
public
officers
in
whatever
manner
they
are
intermediately
kept
the
government
it
must
be
admitted
has
been
from
its
commencement
comparatively
fortunate
in
this
respect
but
the
appointing
power
can
not
always
be
well
advised
in
its
selections
and
the
experience
of
every
country
has
shown
that
public
officers
are
not
at
all
times
proof
against
temptation
it
is
a
duty
therefore
which
the
government
owes
as
well
to
the
interests
committed
to
its
care
as
to
the
officers
themselves
to
provide
every
guard
against
transgressions
of
this
character
that
is
consistent
with
reason
and
humanity
congress
can
not
be
too
jealous
of
the
conduct
of
those
who
are
intrusted
with
the
public
money
and
i
shall
at
all
times
be
disposed
to
encourage
a
watchful
discharge
of
this
duty
if
a
more
direct
cooperation
on
the
part
of
congress
in
the
supervision
of
the
conduct
of
the
officers
intrusted
with
the
custody
and
application
of
the
public
money
is
deemed
desirable
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
assist
in
the
establishment
of
any
judiciou
s
and
constitutional
plan
by
which
that
object
may
be
accomplished
you
will
in
your
wisdom
determine
upon
the
propriety
of
adopting
such
a
plan
and
upon
the
measures
necessary
to
its
effectual
execution
when
the
late
bank
of
the
united
states
was
incorporated
and
made
the
depository
of
the
public
moneys
a
right
was
reserved
to
congress
to
inspect
at
its
pleasure
by
a
committee
of
that
body
the
books
and
the
proceedings
of
the
bank
in
one
of
the
states
whose
banking
institutions
are
supposed
to
rank
amongst
the
first
in
point
of
stability
they
are
subjected
to
constant
examination
by
commissioners
appointed
for
that
purpose
and
much
of
the
success
of
its
banking
system
is
attributed
to
this
watchful
supervision
the
same
course
has
also
in
view
of
its
beneficial
operation
been
adopted
by
an
adjoining
state
favorably
known
for
the
care
it
has
always
bestowed
upon
whatever
relates
to
its
financial
concerns
i
submit
to
your
consideration
whether
a
committee
of
congress
might
not
be
profitably
employed
in
inspecting
at
such
intervals
as
might
be
deemed
proper
the
affairs
and
accounts
of
officers
intrusted
with
the
custody
of
the
public
moneys
the
frequent
performance
of
this
duty
might
be
made
obligatory
on
the
committee
in
respect
to
those
officers
who
have
large
sums
in
their
possession
and
left
discretionary
in
respect
to
others
they
might
report
to
the
executive
such
defalcations
as
were
found
to
exist
with
a
view
to
a
prompt
removal
from
office
unless
the
default
was
satisfactorily
accounted
for
and
report
also
to
congress
at
the
commencement
of
each
session
the
result
of
their
examinations
and
proceedings
it
does
appear
to
me
that
with
a
subjection
of
this
class
of
public
officers
to
the
general
supervision
of
the
executive
to
examinations
by
a
committee
of
congress
at
periods
of
which
they
should
have
no
previous
notice
and
to
prosecution
and
punishment
as
for
felony
for
every
breach
of
trust
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
moneys
might
under
the
system
proposed
be
placed
on
a
surer
foundation
than
it
has
ever
occupied
since
the
establishment
of
the
government
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
lay
before
you
additional
information
containing
new
details
on
this
interesting
subject
to
these
i
ask
your
early
attention
that
it
should
have
given
rise
to
great
diversity
of
opinion
can
not
be
a
subject
of
surprise
after
the
collection
and
custody
of
the
public
moneys
had
been
for
so
many
years
connected
with
and
made
subsidiary
to
the
advancement
of
private
interests
a
return
to
the
simple
selfdenying
ordinances
of
the
constitution
could
not
but
be
difficult
but
time
and
free
discussion
eliciting
the
sentiments
of
the
people
and
aided
by
that
conciliatory
spirit
which
has
ever
characterized
their
course
on
great
emergencies
were
relied
upon
for
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
the
question
already
has
this
anticipation
on
one
important
point
at
leastthe
impropriety
of
diverting
public
money
to
private
purposesbeen
fully
realized
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
legislation
upon
that
branch
of
the
subject
would
now
be
embarrassed
by
a
difference
of
opinion
or
fail
to
receive
the
cordial
support
of
a
large
majority
of
our
constituents
the
connection
which
formerly
existed
between
the
government
and
banks
was
in
reality
injurious
to
both
as
well
as
to
the
general
interests
of
the
community
at
large
it
aggravated
the
disasters
of
trade
and
the
derangements
of
commercial
intercourse
and
administered
new
excitements
and
additional
means
to
wild
and
reckless
speculations
the
disappointment
of
which
threw
the
country
into
convulsions
of
panic
and
all
but
produced
violence
and
bloodshed
the
imprudent
expansion
of
bank
credits
which
was
the
natural
result
of
the
command
of
the
revenues
of
the
state
furnished
the
resources
for
unbounded
license
in
every
species
of
adventure
seduced
industry
from
its
regular
and
salutary
occupations
by
the
hope
of
abundance
without
labor
and
deranged
the
social
state
by
tempting
all
trades
and
professions
into
the
vortex
of
speculation
on
remote
contingencies
the
same
widespreading
influence
impeded
also
the
resources
of
the
government
curtailed
its
useful
operations
embarrassed
the
fulfillment
of
its
obligations
and
seriously
interfered
with
the
execution
of
the
laws
large
appropriations
and
oppressive
taxes
are
the
natural
consequences
of
such
a
connection
since
they
increase
the
profits
of
those
who
are
allowed
to
use
the
public
funds
and
make
it
their
interest
that
money
should
be
accumulated
and
expenditures
multiplied
it
is
thus
that
a
concentrated
money
power
is
tempted
to
become
an
active
agent
in
political
affairs
and
all
past
experience
has
shown
on
which
side
that
influence
will
be
arrayed
we
deceive
ourselves
if
we
suppose
that
it
will
ever
be
found
asserting
and
supporting
the
rights
of
the
community
at
large
in
opposition
to
the
claims
of
the
few
in
a
government
whose
distinguishing
characteristic
should
be
a
diffusion
and
equalization
of
its
benefits
and
burdens
the
advantage
of
individuals
will
be
augmented
at
the
expense
of
the
community
at
large
nor
is
it
the
nature
of
combinations
for
the
acquisition
of
legislative
influence
to
confine
their
interference
to
the
single
object
for
which
they
were
originally
formed
the
temptation
to
extend
it
to
other
matters
is
on
the
contrary
not
unfrequently
too
strong
to
be
resisted
the
rightful
influence
in
the
direction
of
public
affairs
of
the
mass
of
the
people
is
therefore
in
no
slight
danger
of
being
sensibly
and
injuriously
affected
by
giving
to
a
comparatively
small
but
very
efficient
class
a
direct
and
exclusive
personal
interest
in
so
important
a
portion
of
the
legislation
of
congress
as
that
which
relates
to
the
custody
of
the
public
moneys
if
laws
acting
upon
private
interests
can
not
always
be
avoided
they
should
be
confined
within
the
narrowest
limits
and
left
wherever
possible
to
the
legislatures
of
the
states
when
not
thus
restricted
they
lead
to
combinations
of
powerful
associations
foster
an
influence
necessarily
selfish
and
turn
the
fair
course
of
legislation
to
sinister
ends
rather
than
to
objects
that
advance
public
liberty
and
promote
the
general
good
the
whole
subject
now
rests
with
you
and
i
can
not
but
express
a
hope
that
some
definite
measure
will
be
adopted
at
the
present
session
it
will
not
i
am
sure
be
deemed
out
of
place
for
me
here
to
remark
that
the
declaration
of
my
views
in
opposition
to
the
policy
of
employing
banks
as
depositories
of
the
government
funds
can
not
justly
be
construed
as
indicative
of
hostility
official
or
personal
to
those
institutions
or
to
repeat
in
this
form
and
in
connection
with
this
subject
opinions
which
i
have
uniformly
entertained
and
on
all
proper
occasions
expressed
though
always
opposed
to
their
creation
in
the
form
of
exclusive
privileges
and
as
a
state
magistrate
aiming
by
appropriate
legislation
to
secure
the
community
against
the
consequences
of
their
occasional
mismanagement
i
have
yet
ever
wished
to
see
them
protected
in
the
exercise
of
rights
conferred
by
law
and
have
never
doubted
their
utility
when
properly
managed
in
promoting
the
interests
of
trade
and
through
that
channel
the
other
interests
of
the
community
to
the
general
government
they
present
themselves
merely
as
state
institutions
having
no
necessary
connection
with
its
legislation
or
its
administration
like
other
state
establishments
they
may
be
used
or
not
in
conducting
the
affairs
of
the
government
as
public
policy
and
the
general
interests
of
the
union
may
seem
to
require
the
only
safe
or
proper
principle
upon
which
their
intercourse
with
the
government
can
be
regulated
is
that
which
regulates
their
intercourse
with
the
private
citizenthe
conferring
of
mutual
benefits
when
the
government
can
accomplish
a
financial
operation
better
with
the
aid
of
the
banks
than
without
it
it
should
be
at
liberty
to
seek
that
aid
as
it
would
the
services
of
a
private
banker
or
other
capitalist
or
agent
giving
the
preference
to
those
who
will
serve
it
on
the
best
terms
nor
can
there
ever
exist
an
interest
in
the
officers
of
the
general
government
as
such
inducing
them
to
embarrass
or
annoy
the
state
banks
any
more
than
to
incur
the
hostility
of
any
other
class
of
state
institutions
or
of
private
citizens
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
things
that
hostility
to
these
institutions
can
spring
from
this
source
or
any
opposition
to
their
course
of
business
except
when
they
themselves
depart
from
the
objects
of
their
creation
and
attempt
to
usurp
powers
not
conferred
upon
them
or
to
subvert
the
standard
of
value
established
by
the
constitution
while
opposition
to
their
regular
operations
can
not
exist
in
this
quarter
resistance
to
any
attempt
to
make
the
government
dependent
upon
them
for
the
successful
administration
of
public
affairs
is
a
matter
of
duty
as
i
trust
it
ever
will
be
of
inclination
no
matter
from
what
motive
or
consideration
the
attempt
may
originate
it
is
no
more
than
just
to
the
banks
to
say
that
in
the
late
emergency
most
of
them
firmly
resisted
the
strongest
temptations
to
extend
their
paper
issues
when
apparently
sustained
in
a
suspension
of
specie
payments
by
public
opinion
even
though
in
some
cases
invited
by
legislative
enactments
to
this
honorable
course
aided
by
the
resistance
of
the
general
government
acting
in
obedience
to
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
to
the
introduction
of
an
irredeemable
paper
medium
may
be
attributed
in
a
great
degree
the
speedy
restoration
of
our
currency
to
a
sound
state
and
the
business
of
the
country
to
its
wonted
prosperity
the
banks
have
but
to
continue
in
the
same
safe
course
and
be
content
in
their
appropriate
sphere
to
avoid
all
interference
from
the
general
government
and
to
derive
from
it
all
the
protection
and
benefits
which
it
bestows
on
other
state
establishments
on
the
people
of
the
states
and
on
the
states
themselves
in
this
their
true
position
they
can
not
but
secure
the
confidence
and
good
will
of
the
people
and
the
government
which
they
can
only
lose
when

leaping
from
their
legitimate
sphere
they
attempt
to
control
the
legislation
of
the
country
and
pervert
the
operations
of
the
government
to
their
own
purposes
our
experience
under
the
act
passed
at
the
last
session
to
grant
preemption
rights
to
settlers
on
the
public
lands
has
as
yet
been
too
limited
to
enable
us
to
pronounce
with
safety
upon
the
efficacy
of
its
provisions
to
carry
out
the
wise
and
liberal
policy
of
the
government
in
that
respect
there
is
however
the
best
reason
to
anticipate
favorable
results
from
its
operation
the
recommendations
formerly
submitted
to
you
in
respect
to
a
graduation
of
the
price
of
the
public
lands
remain
to
be
finally
acted
upon
having
found
no
reason
to
change
the
views
then
expressed
your
attention
to
them
is
again
respectfully
requested
every
proper
exertion
has
been
made
and
will
be
continued
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
congress
in
relation
to
the
tobacco
trade
as
indicated
in
the
several
resolutions
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
legislation
of
the
two
branches
a
favorable
impression
has
i
trust
been
made
in
the
different
foreign
countries
to
which
particular
attention
has
been
directed
and
although
we
can
not
hope
for
an
early
change
in
their
policy
as
in
many
of
them
a
convenient
and
large
revenue
is
derived
from
monopolies
in
the
fabrication
and
sale
of
this
article
yet
as
these
monopolies
are
really
injurious
to
the
people
where
they
are
established
and
the
revenue
derived
from
them
may
be
less
injuriously
and
with
equal
facility
obtained
from
another
and
a
liberal
system
of
administration
we
can
not
doubt
that
our
efforts
will
be
eventually
crowned
with
success
if
persisted
in
with
temperate
firmness
and
sustained
by
prudent
legislation
in
recommending
to
congress
the
adoption
of
the
necessary
provisions
at
this
session
for
taking
the
next
census
or
enumeration
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
the
suggestion
presents
itself
whether
the
scope
of
the
measure
might
not
be
usefully
extended
by
causing
it
to
embrace
authentic
statistical
returns
of
the
great
interests
specially
intrusted
to
or
necessarily
affected
by
the
legislation
of
congress
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
presents
a
satisfactory
account
of
the
state
of
the
army
and
of
the
several
branches
of
the
public
service
confided
to
the
superintendence
of
that
officer
the
law
increasing
and
organizing
the
military
establishment
of
the
united
states
has
been
nearly
carried
into
effect
and
the
army
has
been
extensively
and
usefully
employed
during
the
past
season
i
would
again
call
to
your
notice
the
subjects
connected
with
and
essential
to
the
military
defenses
of
the
country
which
were
submitted
to
you
at
the
last
session
but
which
were
not
acted
upon
as
is
supposed
for
want
of
time
the
most
important
of
them
is
the
organization
of
the
militia
on
the
maritime
and
inland
frontiers
this
measure
is
deemed
important
as
it
is
believed
that
it
will
furnish
an
effective
volunteer
force
in
aid
of
the
regular
army
and
may
form
the
basis
of
a
general
system
of
organization
for
the
entire
militia
of
the
united
states
the
erection
of
a
national
foundry
and
gunpowder
manufactory
and
one
for
making
small
arms
the
latter
to
be
situated
at
some
point
west
of
the
allegany
mountains
all
appear
to
be
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
again
urged
upon
your
attention
the
plan
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
war
for
the
distribution
of
the
forces
of
the
united
states
in
time
of
peace
is
well
calculated
to
promote
regularity
and
economy
in
the
fiscal
administration
of
the
service
to
preserve
the
discipline
of
the
troops
and
to
render
them
available
for
the
maintenance
of
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
the
country
with
this
view
likewise
i
recommend
the
adoption
of
the
plan
presented
by
that
officer
for
the
defense
of
the
western
frontier
the
preservation
of
the
lives
and
property
of
our
fellowcitizens
who
are
settled
upon
that
border
country
as
well
as
the
existence
of
the
indian
population
which
might
be
tempted
by
our
want
of
preparation
to
rush
on
their
own
destruction
and
attack
the
white
settlements
all
seem
to
require
that
this
subject
should
be
acted
upon
without
delay
and
the
war
department
authorized
to
place
that
country
in
a
state
of
complete
defense
against
any
assault
from
the
numerous
and
warlike
tribes
which
are
congregated
on
that
border
it
affords
me
sincere
pleasure
to
be
able
to
apprise
you
of
the
entire
removal
of
the
cherokee
nation
of
indians
to
their
new
homes
west
of
the
mississippi
the
measures
authorized
by
congress
at
its
last
session
with
a
view
to
the
longstanding
controversy
with
them
have
had
the
happiest
effects
by
an
agreement
concluded
with
them
by
the
commanding
general
in
that
country
who
has
performed
the
duties
assigned
to
him
on
the
occasion
with
commendable
energy
and
humanity
their
removal
has
been
principally
under
the
conduct
of
their
own
chiefs
and
they
have
emigrated
without
any
apparent
reluctance
the
successful
accomplishment
of
this
important
object
the
removal
also
of
the
entire
creek
nation
with
the
exception
of
a
small
number
of
fugitives
amongst
the
seminoles
in
florida
the
progress
already
made
toward
a
speedy
completion
of
the
removal
of
the
chickasaws
the
choctaws
the
pottawatamies
the
ottawas
and
the
chippewas
with
the
extensive
purchases
of
indian
lands
during
the
present
year
have
rendered
the
speedy
and
successful
result
of
the
longestablished
policy
of
the
government
upon
the
subject
of
indian
affairs
entirely
certain
the
occasion
is
therefore
deemed
a
proper
one
to
place
this
policy
in
such
a
point
of
view
as
will
exonerate
the
government
of
the
united
states
from
the
undeserved
reproach
which
has
been
cast
upon
it
through
several
successive
administrations
that
a
mixed
occupancy
of
the
same
territory
by
the
white
and
red
man
is
incompatible
with
the
safety
or
happiness
of
either
is
a
position
in
respect
to
which
there
has
long
since
ceased
to
be
room
for
a
difference
of
opinion
reason
and
experience
have
alike
demonstrated
its
impracticability
the
bitter
fruits
of
every
attempt
heretofore
to
overcome
the
barriers
interposed
by
nature
have
only
been
destruction
both
physical
and
moral
to
the
indian
dangerous
conflicts
of
authority
between
the
federal
and
state
governments
and
detriment
to
the
individual
prosperity
of
the
citizen
as
well
as
to
the
general
improvement
of
the
country
the
remedial
policy
the
principles
of
which
were
settled
more
than
thirty
years
ago
under
the
administration
of
mr
jefferson
consists
in
an
extinction
for
a
fair
consideration
of
the
title
to
all
the
lands
still
occupied
by
the
indians
within
the
states
and
territories
of
the
united
states
their
removal
to
a
country
west
of
the
mississippi
much
more
extensive
and
better
adapted
to
their
condition
than
that
on
which
they
then
resided
the
guarantee
to
them
by
the
united
states
of
their
exclusive
possession
of
that
country
forever
exempt
from
all
intrusions
by
white
men
with
ample
provisions
for
their
security
against
external
violence
and
internal
dissensions
and
the
extension
to
them
of
suitable
facilities
for
their
advancement
in
civilization
this
has
not
been
the
policy
of
particular
administrations
only
but
of
each
in
succession
since
the
first
attempt
to
carry
it
out
under
that
of
mr
monroe
all
have
labored
for
its
accomplishment
only
with
different
degrees
of
success
the
manner
of
its
execution
has
it
is
true
from
time
to
time
given
rise
to
conflicts
of
opinion
and
unjust
imputations
but
in
respect
to
the
wisdom
and
necessity
of
the
policy
itself
there
has
not
from
the
beginning
existed
a
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
calm
judicious
disinterested
friend
of
the
indian
race
accustomed
to
reflection
and
enlightened
by
experience
occupying
the
double
character
of
contractor
on
its
own
account
and
guardian
for
the
parties
contracted
with
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
the
dealings
of
the
federal
government
with
the
indian
tribes
would
escape
misrepresentation
that
there
occurred
ill
the
early
settlement
of
this
country
as
in
all
others
where
the
civilized
race
has
succeeded
to
the
possessions
of
the
savage
instances
of
oppression
and
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
former
there
is
too
much
reason
to
believe
no
such
offenses
can
however
be
justly
charged
upon
this
government
since
it
became
free
to
pursue
its
own
course
its
dealings
with
the
indian
tribes
have
been
just
and
friendly
throughout
its
efforts
for
their
civilization
constant
and
directed
by
the
best
feelings
of
humanity
its
watchfulness
in
protecting
them
from
individual
frauds
unremitting
its
forbearance
under
the
keenest
provocations
the
deepest
injuries
and
the
most
flagrant
outrages
may
challenge
at
least
a
comparison
with
any
nation
ancient
or
modern
in
similar
circumstances
and
if
in
future
times
a
powerful
civilized
and
happy
nation
of
indians
shall
be
found
to
exist
within
the
limits
of
this
northern
continent
it
will
be
owing
to
the
consummation
of
that
policy
which
has
been
so
unjustly
assailed
only
a
very
brief
reference
to
facts
in
confirmation
of
this
assertion
can
in
this
form
be
given
and
you
are
therefore
necessarily
referred
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
further
details
to
the
cherokees
whose
case
has
perhaps
excited
the
greatest
share
of
attention
and
sympathy
the
united
states
have
granted
in
fee
with
a
perpetual
guaranty
of
exclusive
and
peaceable
possession
acres
of
land
on
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
eligibly
situated
in
a
healthy
climate
and
in
all
respects
better
suited
to
their
condition
than
the
country
they
have
left
in
exchange
for
only
acres
on
the
east
side
of
the
same
river
the
united
states
have
in
addition
stipulated
to
pay
them
for
their
interest
in
and
improvements
on
the
lands
thus
relinquished
and
for
subsistence
and
other
beneficial
purposes
thereby
putting
it
in
their
power
to
become
one
of
the
most
wealthy
and
independent
separate
communities
of
the
same
extent
in
the
world
by
the
treaties
made
and
ratified
with
the
miamies
the
chippewas
the
sioux
the
sacs
and
fox
es
and
the
winnebagoes
during
the
last
year
the
indian
title
to
acres
has
been
extinguished
these
purchases
have
been
much
more
extensive
than
those
of
any
previous
year
and
have
with
other
indian
expenses
borne
very
heavily
upon
the
treasury
they
leave
however
but
a
small
quantity
of
unbought
indian
lands
within
the
states
and
territories
and
the
legislature
and
executive
were
equally
sensible
of
the
propriety
of
a
final
and
more
speedy
extinction
of
indian
titles
within
those
limits
the
treaties
which
were
with
a
single
exception
made
in
pursuance
of
previous
appropriations
for
defraying
the
expenses
have
subsequently
been
ratified
by
the
senate
and
received
the
sanction
of
congress
by
the
appropriations
necessary
to
carry
them
into
effect
of
the
terms
upon
which
these
important
negotiations
were
concluded
i
can
speak
from
direct
knowledge
and
i
feel
no
difficulty
in
affirming
that
the
interest
of
the
indians
in
the
extensive
territory
embraced
by
them
is
to
be
paid
for
at
its
fair
value
and
that
no
more
favorable
terms
have
been
granted
to
the
united
states
than
would
have
been
reasonably
expected
in
a
negotiation
with
civilized
men
fully
capable
of
appreciating
and
protecting
their
own
rights
for
the
indian
title
to
acres
acquired
since
the
th
of
march
the
united
states
have
paid
in
permanent
annuities
lands
reservations
for
indians
expenses
of
removal
and
subsistence
merchandise
mechanical
and
agricultural
establishments
and
implements
when
the
heavy
expenses
incurred
by
the
united
states
and
the
circumstance
that
so
large
a
portion
of
the
entire
territory
will
be
forever
unsalable
are
considered
and
this
price
is
compared
with
that
for
which
the
united
states
sell
their
own
lands
no
one
can
doubt
that
justice
has
been
done
to
the
indians
in
these
purchases
also
certain
it
is
that
the
transactions
of
the
federal
government
with
the
indians
have
been
uniformly
characterized
by
a
sincere
and
paramount
desire
to
promote
their
welfare
and
it
must
be
a
source
of
the
highest
gratification
to
every
friend
to
justice
and
humanity
to
learn
that
not
withstanding
the
obstructions
from
time
to
time
thrown
in
its
way
and
the
difficulties
which
have
arisen
from
the
peculiar
and
impracticable
nature
of
the
indian
character
the
wise
humane
and
undeviating
policy
of
the
government
in
this
the
most
difficult
of
all
our
relations
foreign
or
domestic
has
at
length
been
justified
to
the
world
in
its
near
approach
to
a
happy
and
certain
consummation
the
condition
of
the
tribes
which
occupy
the
country
set
apart
for
them
in
the
west
is
highly
prosperous
and
encourages
the
hope
of
their
early
civilization
they
have
for
the
most
part
abandoned
the
hunter
state
and
turned
their
attention
to
agricultural
pursuits
all
those
who
have
been
established
for
any
length
of
time
in
that
fertile
region
maintain
themselves
by
their
own
industry
there
are
among
them
traders
of
no
inconsiderable
capital
and
planters
exporting
cotton
to
some
extent
but
the
greater
number
are
small
agriculturists
living
in
comfort
upon
the
produce
of
their
farms
the
recent
emigrants
although
they
have
in
some
instances
removed
reluctantly
have
readily
acquiesced
in
their
unavoidable
destiny
they
have
found
at
once
a
recompense
for
past
sufferings
and
an
incentive
to
industrious
habits
in
the
abundance
and
comforts
around
them
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
all
these
tribes
are
friendly
in
their
feelings
toward
the
united
states
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
acquisition
of
individual
wealth
the
pursuits
of
agriculture
and
habits
of
industry
will
gradually
subdue
their
warlike
propensities
and
incline
them
to
maintain
peace
among
themselves
to
effect
this
desirable
object
the
attention
of
congress
is
solicited
to
the
measures
recommended
by
the
secretary
of
war
for
their
future
government
and
protection
as
well
from
each
other
as
from
the
hostility
of
the
warlike
tribes
around
them
and
the
intrusions
of
the
whites
the
policy
of
the
government
has
given
them
a
permanent
home
and
guaranteed
to
them
its
peaceful
and
undisturbed
possession
it
only
remains
to
give
them
a
government
and
laws
which
will
encourage
industry
and
secure
to
them
the
rewards
of
their
exertions
the
importance
of
some
form
of
government
can
not
be
too
much
insisted
upon
the
earliest
effects
will
be
to
diminish
the
causes
and
occasions
for
hostilities
among
the
tribes
to
inspire
an
interest
in
the
observance
of
laws
to
which
they
will
have
themselves
assented
and
to
multiply
the
securities
of
property
and
the
motives
for
selfimprovement
intimately
connected
with
this
subject
is
the
establishment
of
the
military
defenses
recommended
by
the
secretary
of
war
which
have
been
already
referred
to
without
them
the
government
will
be
powerless
to
redeem
its
pledge
of
protection
to
the
emigrating
indians
against
the
numerous
warlike
tribes
that
surround
them
and
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
the
frontier
settlers
of
the
bordering
states
the
case
of
the
seminoles
constitutes
at
present
the
only
exception
to
the
successful
efforts
of
the
government
to
remove
the
indians
to
the
homes
assigned
them
west
of
the
mississippi
four
hundred
of
this
tribe
emigrated
in
and
in
and
leaving
in
the
country
it
is
supposed
about
indians
the
continued
treacherous
conduct
of
these
people
the
savage
and
unprovoked
murders
they
have
lately
committed
butchering
whole
families
of
the
settlers
of
the
territory
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
and
making
their
way
into
the
very
center
and
heart
of
the
country
so
that
no
part
of
it
is
free
from
their
ravages
their
frequent
attacks
on
the
lighthouses
along
that
dangerous
coast
and
the
barbarity
with
which
they
have
murdered
the
passengers
and
crews
of
such
vessels
as
have
been
wrecked
upon
the
reefs
and
keys
which
border
the
gulf
leave
the
government
no
alternative
but
to
continue
the
military
operations
against
them
until
they
are
totally
expelled
from
florida
there
are
other
motives
which
would
urge
the
government
to
pursue
this
course
toward
the
seminoles
the
united
states
have
fulfilled
in
good
faith
all
their
treaty
stipulations
with
the
indian
tribes
and
have
in
every
other
instance
insisted
upon
a
like
performance
of
their
obligations
to
relax
from
this
salutary
rule
because
the
seminoles
have
maintained
themselves
so
long
in
the
territory
they
had
relinquished
and
in
defiance
of
their
frequent
and
solemn
engagements
still
continue
to
wage
a
ruthless
war
against
the
united
states
would
not
only
evince
a
want
of
constancy
on
our
part
but
be
of
evil
example
in
our
intercourse
with
other
tribes
experience
has
shown
that
but
little
is
to
be
gained
by
the
march
of
armies
through
a
country
so
intersected
with
inaccessible
swamps
and
marshes
and
which
from
the
fatal
character
of
the
climate
must
be
abandoned
at
the
end
of
the
winter
i
recommend
therefore
to
your
attention
the
plan
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
war
in
the
accompanying
report
for
the
permanent
occupation
of
the
portion
of
the
territory
freed
from
the
indians
and
the
more
efficient
protection
of
the
people
of
florida
from
their
inhuman
warfare
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
herewith
transmitted
it
will
appear
that
a
large
portion
of
the
disposable
naval
force
is
either
actively
employed
or
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
the
purposes
of
experience
and
discipline
and
the
protection
of
our
commerce
so
effectual
has
been
this
protection
that
so
far
as
the
information
of
government
extends
not
a
single
outrage
has
been
attempted
on
a
vessel
carrying
the
flag
of
the
united
states
within
the
present
year
in
any
quarter
however
distant
or
exposed
the
exploring
expedition
sailed
from
norfolk
on
the
th
of
august
last
and
information
has
been
received
of
its
safe
arrival
at
the
island
of
madeira
the
best
spirit
animates
the
officers
and
crews
and
there
is
every
reason
to
anticipate
from
its
efforts
results
beneficial
to
commerce
and
honorable
to
the
nation
it
will
also
be
seen
that
no
reduction
of
the
force
now
in
commission
is
contemplated
the
unsettled
state
of
a
portion
of
south
america
renders
it
indispensable
that
our
commerce
should
receive
protection
in
that
quarter
the
vast
and
increasing
interests
embarked
in
the
trade
of
the
indian
and
china
seas
in
the
whale
fisheries
of
the
pacific
ocean
and
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
require
equal
attention
to
their
safety
and
a
small
squadron
may
be
employed
to
great
advantage
on
our
atlantic
coast
in
meeting
sudden
demands
for
the
reenforcement
of
other
stations
in
aiding
merchant
vessels
in
distress
in
affording
active
service
to
an
additional
number
of
officers
and
in
visiting
the
different
ports
of
the
united
states
an
accurate
knowledge
of
which
is
obviously
of
the
highest
importance
the
attention
of
congress
is
respectfully
called
to
that
portion
of
the
report
recommending
an
increase
in
the
number
of
smaller
vessels
and
to
other
suggestions
contained
in
that
document
the
rapid
increase
and
wide
expansion
of
our
commerce
which
is
every
day
seeking
new
avenues
of
profitable
adventure
the
absolute
necessity
of
a
naval
force
for
its
protection
precisely
in
the
degree
of
its
extension
a
due
regard
to
the
national
rights
and
honor
the
recollection
of
its
former
exploits
and
the
anticipation
of
its
future
triumphs
whenever
opportunity
presents
itself
which
we
may
rightfully
indulge
from
the
experience
of
the
pastall
seem
to
point
to
the
navy
as
a
most
efficient
arm
of
our
national
defense
and
a
proper
object
of
legislative
encouragement
the
progress
and
condition
of
the
postoffice
department
will
be
seen
by
reference
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
the
extent
of
postroads
covered
by
mail
contracts
is
stated
to
be
miles
and
the
annual
transportation
upon
them
miles
the
number
of
postoffices
in
the
united
states
is
and
rapidly
increasing
the
gross
revenue
for
the
year
ending
on
the
th
day
of
june
last
was
the
accruing
expenditures
excess
of
expenditures
this
has
been
made
up
out
of
the
surplus
previously
on
hand
the
cash
on
hand
on
the
st
instant
was
the
revenue
for

the
year
ending
june
was
more
than
that
for
the
year
ending
june
the
expenditures
of
the
department
had
been
graduated
upon
the
anticipation
of
a
largely
increased
revenue
a
moderate
curtailment
of
mail
service
consequently
became
necessary
and
has
been
effected
to
shield
the
department
against
the
danger
of
embarrassment
its
revenue
is
now
improving
and
it
will
soon
resume
its
onward
course
in
the
march
of
improvement
your
particular
attention
is
requested
to
so
much
of
the
postmastergenerals
report
as
relates
to
the
transportation
of
the
mails
upon
railroads
the
laws
on
that
subject
do
not
seem
adequate
to
secure
that
service
now
become
almost
essential
to
the
public
interests
and
at
the
same
time
protect
the
department
from
combinations
and
unreasonable
demands
nor
can
i
too
earnestly
request
your
attention
to
the
necessity
of
providing
a
more
secure
building
for
this
department
the
danger
of
destruction
to
which
its
important
books
and
papers
are
continually
exposed
as
well
from
the
highly
combustible
character
of
the
building
occupied
as
from
that
of
others
in
the
vicinity
calls
loudly
for
prompt
action
your
attention
is
again
earnestly
invited
to
the
suggestions
and
recommendations
submitted
at
the
last
session
in
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
i
feel
it
my
duty
also
to
bring
to
your
notice
certain
proceedings
at
law
which
have
recently
been
prosecuted
in
this
district
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
on
the
relation
of
messrs
stockton
stokes
of
the
state
of
maryland
against
the
postmastergeneral
and
which
have
resulted
in
the
payment
of
money
out
of
the
national
treasury
for
the
first
time
since
the
establishment
of
the
government
by
judicial
compulsion
exercised
by
the
commonlaw
writ
of
mandamus
issued
by
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
grounds
of
the
proceedings
will
be
found
fully
stated
in
the
report
of
the
decision
and
any
additional
information
which
you
may
desire
will
be
supplied
by
the
proper
department
no
interference
in
the
particular
case
is
contemplated
the
money
has
been
paid
the
claims
of
the
prosecutors
have
been
satisfied
and
the
whole
subject
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
is
finally
disposed
of
but
it
is
on
the
supposition
that
the
case
may
be
regarded
as
an
authoritative
exposition
of
the
law
as
it
now
stands
that
i
have
thought
it
necessary
to
present
it
to
your
consideration
the
object
of
the
application
to
the
circuit
court
was
to
compel
the
postmastergeneral
to
carry
into
effect
an
award
made
by
the
solicitor
of
the
treasury
under
a
special
act
of
congress
for
the
settlement
of
certain
claims
of
the
relators
on
the
postoffice
department
which
award
the
postmastergeneral
declined
to
execute
in
full
until
he
should
receive
further
legislative
direction
on
the
subject
if
the
duty
imposed
on
the
postmastergeneral
by
that
law
was
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
an
official
nature
belonging
to
his
office
as
a
branch
of
the
executive
then
it
is
obvious
that
the
constitutional
competency
of
the
judiciary
to
direct
and
control
him
in
its
discharge
was
necessarily
drawn
in
question
and
if
the
duty
so
imposed
on
the
postmastergeneral
was
to
be
considered
as
merely
ministerial
and
not
executive
it
yet
remained
to
be
shown
that
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
had
authority
to
interfere
by
mandamus
such
a
power
having
never
before
been
asserted
or
claimed
by
that
court
with
a
view
to
the
settlement
of
these
important
questions
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
was
carried
by
a
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
opinion
of
that
tribunal
the
duty
imposed
on
the
postmastergeneral
was
not
an
official
executive
duty
but
one
of
a
merely
ministerial
nature
the
grave
constitutional
questions
which
had
been
discussed
were
therefore
excluded
from
the
decision
of
the
case
the
court
indeed
expressly
admitting
that
with
powers
and
duties
properly
belonging
to
the
executive
no
other
department
can
interfere
by
the
writ
of
mandamus
and
the
question
therefore
resolved
itself
into
this
has
congress
conferred
upon
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
the
power
to
issue
such
a
writ
to
an
officer
of
the
general
government
commanding
him
to
perform
a
ministerial
act
a
majority
of
the
court
have
decided
that
it
has
but
have
rounded
their
decision
upon
a
process
of
reasoning
which
in
my
judgment
renders
further
legislative
provision
indispensable
to
the
public
interests
and
the
equal
administration
of
justice
it
has
long
since
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
that
neither
that
tribunal
nor
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
held
within
the
respective
states
possess
the
power
in
question
but
it
is
now
held
that
this
power
denied
to
both
of
these
high
tribunals
to
the
former
by
the
constitution
and
to
the
latter
by
congress
has
been
by
its
legislation
vested
in
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
no
such
direct
grant
of
power
to
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
is
claimed
but
it
has
been
held
to
result
by
necessary
implication
from
several
sections
of
the
law
establishing
the
court
one
of
these
sections
declares
that
the
laws
of
maryland
as
they
existed
at
the
time
of
the
cession
should
be
in
force
in
that
part
of
the
district
ceded
by
that
state
and
by
this
provision
the
common
law
in
civil
and
criminal
cases
as
it
prevailed
in
maryland
in
was
established
in
that
part
of
the
district
in
england
the
court
of
kings
benchbecause
the
sovereign
who
according
to
the
theory
of
the
constitution
is
the
fountain
of
justice
originally
sat
there
in
person
and
is
still
deemed
to
be
present
in
construction
of
lawalone
possesses
the
high
power
of
issuing
the
writ
of
mandamus
not
only
to
inferior
jurisdictions
and
corporations
but
also
to
magistrates
and
others
commanding
them
in
the
kings
name
to
do
what
their
duty
requires
in
cases
where
there
is
a
vested
right
and
no
other
specific
remedy
it
has
been
held
in
the
case
referred
to
that
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
by
the
constitution
rendered
incompetent
to
exercise
this
power
and
as
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
cases
at
common
law
and
the
highest
court
of
original
jurisdiction
in
the
district
the
right
to
issue
the
writ
of
mandamus
is
incident
to
its
commonlaw
powers
another
ground
relied
upon
to
maintain
the
power
in
question
is
that
it
was
included
by
fair
construction
in
the
powers
granted
to
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
by
the
act
to
provide
for
the
more
convenient
organization
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
passed
th
february
that
the
act
establishing
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
passed
the
th
day
of
february
conferred
upon
that
court
and
the
judges
thereof
the
same
powers
as
were
by
law
vested
in
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
judges
of
the
said
courts
that
the
repeal
of
the
firstmentioned
act
which
took
place
in
the
next
year
did
not
divest
the
circuit
court
of
this
district
of
the
authority
in
dispute
but
left
it
still
clothed
with
the
powers
over
the
subject
which
it
is
conceded
were
taken
away
from
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
by
the
repeal
of
the
act
of
th
february
admitting
that
the
adoption
of
the
laws
of
maryland
for
a
portion
of
this
district
confers
on
the
circuit
court
thereof
in
that
portion
the
transcendent
extrajudicial
prerogative
powers
of
the
court
of
kings
bench
in
england
or
that
either
of
the
acts
of
congress
by
necessary
implication
authorizes
the
former
court
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
an
officer
of
the
united
states
to
compel
him
to
perform
a
ministerial
duty
the
consequences
are
in
one
respect
the
same
the
result
in
either
case
is
that
the
officers
of
the
united
states
stationed
in
different
parts
of
the
united
states
are
in
respect
to
the
performance
of
their
official
duties
subject
to
different
laws
and
a
different
supervisionthose
in
the
states
to
one
rule
and
those
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
another
and
a
very
different
one
in
the
district
their
official
conduct
is
subject
to
a
judicial
control
from
which
in
the
states
they
are
exempt
whatever
difference
of
opinion
may
exist
as
to
the
expediency
of
vesting
such
a
power
in
the
judiciary
in
a
system
of
government
constituted
like
that
of
the
united
states
all
must
agree
that
these
disparaging
discrepancies
in
the
law
and
in
the
administration
of
justice
ought
not
to
he
permitted
to
continue
and
as
congress
alone
can
provide
the
remedy
the
subject
is
unavoidably
presented
to
your
consideration

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
we
have
reason
to
renew
the
expression
of
our
devout
gratitude
to
the
giver
of
all
good
for
his
benign
protection
our
country
presents
on
every
side
the
evidences
of
that
continued
favor
under
whose
auspices
it
has
gradually
risen
from
a
few
feeble
and
dependent
colonies
to
a
prosperous
and
powerful
confederacy
we
are
blessed
with
domestic
tranquillity
and
all
the
elements
of
national
prosperity
the
pestilence
which
invading
for
a
time
some
flourishing
portions
of
the
union
interrupted
the
general
prevalence
of
unusual
health
has
happily
been
limited
in
extent
and
arrested
in
its
fatal
career
the
industry
and
prudence
of
our
citizens
are
gradually
relieving
them
from
the
pecuniary
embarrassments
under
which
portions
of
them
have
labored
judicious
legislation
and
the
natural
and
boundless
resources
of
the
country
have
afforded
wise
end
timely
aid
to
private
enterprise
and
the
activity
always
characteristic
of
our
people
has
already
in
a
great
degree
resumed
its
usual
and
profitable
channels
the
condition
of
our
foreign
relations
has
not
materially
changed
since
the
last
annual
message
of
my
predecessor
we
remain
at
peace
with
all
nations
and
no
efforts
on
my
part
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
our
rights
and
the
honor
of
the
country
shall
be
spared
to
maintain
a
position
so
consonant
to
our
institutions
we
have
faithfully
sustained
the
foreign
policy
with
which
the
united
states
under
the
guidance
of
their
first
president
took
their
stand
in
the
family
of
nationsthat
of
regulating
their
intercourse
with
other
powers
by
the
approved
principles
of
private
life
asking
and
according
equal
rights
and
equal
privileges
rendering
and
demanding
justice
in
all
cases
advancing
their
own
and
discussing
the
pretensions
of
others
with
candor
directness
and
sincerity
appealing
at
all
times
to
reason
but
never
yielding
to
force
nor
seeking
to
acquire
anything
for
themselves
by
its
exercise
a
rigid
adherence
to
this
policy
has
left
this
government
with
scarcely
a
claim
upon
its
justice
for
injuries
arising
from
acts
committed
by
its
authority
the
most
imposing
and
perplexing
of
those
of
the
united
states
upon
foreign
governments
for
aggressions
upon
our
citizens
were
disposed
of
by
my
predecessor
independently
of
the
benefits
conferred
upon
our
citizens
by
restoring
to
the
mercantile
community
so
many
millions
of
which
they
had
been
wrongfully
divested
a
great
service
was
also
rendered
to
his
country
by
the
satisfactory
adjustment
of
so
many
ancient
and
irritating
subjects
of
contention
and
it
reflects
no
ordinary
credit
on
his
successful
administration
of
public
affairs
that
this
great
object
was
accomplished
without
compromising
on
any
occasion
either
the
honor
or
the
peace
of
the
nation
with
european
powers
no
new
subjects
of
difficulty
have
arisen
and
those
which
were
under
discussion
although
not
terminated
do
not
present
a
more
unfavorable
aspect
for
the
future
preservation
of
that
good
understanding
which
it
has
ever
been
our
desire
to
cultivate
of
pending
questions
the
most
important
is
that
which
exists
with
the
government
of
great
britain
in
respect
to
our
northeastern
boundary
it
is
with
unfeigned
regret
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
must
look
back
upon
the
abortive
efforts
made
by
the
executive
for
a
period
of
more
than
half
a
century
to
determine
what
no
nation
should
suffer
long
to
remain
in
disputethe
true
line
which
divides
its
possessions
from
those
of
other
powers
the
nature
of
the
settlements
on
the
borders
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
neighboring
territory
was
for
a
season
such
that
this
perhaps
was
not
indispensable
to
a
faithful
performance
of
the
duties
of
the
federal
government
time
has
however
changed
this
state
of
things
and
has
brought
about
a
condition
of
affairs
in
which
the
true
interests
of
both
countries
imperatively
require
that
this
question
should
be
put
at
rest
it
is
not
to
be
disguised
that
with
full
confidence
often
expressed
in
the
desire
of
the
british
government
to
terminate
it
we
are
apparently
as
far
from
its
adjustment
as
we
were
at
the
time
of
signing
the
treaty
of
peace
in
the
sole
result
of
longpending
negotiations
and
a
perplexing
arbitration
appears
to
be
a
conviction
on
its
part
that
a
conventional
line
must
be
adopted
from
the
impossibility
of
ascertaining
the
true
one
according
to
the
description
contained
in
that
treaty
without
coinciding
in
this
opinion
which
is
not
thought
to
be
well
rounded
my
predecessor
gave
the
strongest
proof
of
the
earnest
desire
of
the
united
states
to
terminate
satisfactorily
this
dispute
by
proposing
the
substitution
of
a
conventional
line
if
the
consent
of
the
states
interested
in
the
question
could
be
obtained
to
this
proposition
no
answer
has
as
yet
been
received
the
attention
of
the
british
government
has
however
been
urgently
invited
to
the
subject
and
its
reply
can
not
i
am
confident
be
much
longer
delayed
the
general
relations
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
are
of
the
most
friendly
character
and
i
am
well
satisfied
of
the
sincere
disposition
of
that
government
to
maintain
them
upon
their
present
footing
this
disposition
has
also
i
am
persuaded
become
more
general
with
the
people
of
england
than
at
any
previous
period
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
to
you
how
cordially
it
is
reciprocated
by
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
the
conviction
which
must
be
common
to
all
of
the
injurious
consequences
that
result
from
keeping
open
this
irritating
question
and
the
certainty
that
its
final
settlement
can
not
be
much
longer
deferred
will
i
trust
lead
to
an
early
and
satisfactory
adjustment
at
your
last
session
i
laid
before
you
the
recent
communications
between
the
two
governments
and
between
this
government
and
that
of
the
state
of
maine
in
whose
solicitude
concerning
a
subject
in
which
she
has
so
deep
an
interest
every
portion
of
the
union
participates
the
feelings
produced
by
a
temporary
interruption
of
those
harmonious
relations
between
france
and
the
united
states
which
are
due
as
well
to
the
recollections
of
former
times
as
to
a
correct
appreciation
of
existing
interests
have
been
happily
succeeded
by
a
cordial
disposition
on
both
sides
to
cultivate
an
active
friendship
in
their
future
intercourse
the
opinion
undoubtedly
correct
and
steadily
entertained
by
us
that
the
commercial
relations
at
present
existing
between
the
two
countries
are
susceptible
of
great
and
reciprocally
beneficial
improvements
is
obviously
gaining
ground
in
france
and
i
am
assured
of
the
disposition
of
that
government
to
favor
the
accomplishment
of
such
an
object
this
disposition
shall
be
met
in
a
proper
spirit
on
our
part
the
few
and
comparatively
unimportant
questions
that
remain
to
be
adjusted
between
us
can
i
have
no
doubt
be
settled
with
entire
satisfaction
and
without
difficulty
between
russia
and
the
united
states
sentiments
of
good
will
continue
to
be
mutually
cherished
our
minister
recently
accredited
to
that
court
has
been
received
with
a
frankness
and
cordiality
and
with
evidences
of
respect
for
his
country
which
leave
us
no
room
to
doubt
the
preservation
in
future
of
those
amicable
and
liberal
relations
which
have
so
long
and
so
uninterruptedly
existed
between
the
two
countries
on
the
few
subjects
under
discussion
between
us
an
early
and
just
decision
is
confidently
anticipated
a
correspondence
has
been
opened
with
the
government
of
austria
for
the
establishment
of
diplomatic
relations
in
conformity
with
the
wishes
of
congress
as
indicated
by
an
appropriation
act
of
the
session
of
and
arrangements
made
for
the
purpose
which
will
be
duly
carried
into
effect
with
austria
and
prussia
and
with
the
states
of
the
german
empire
now
composing
with
the
latter
the
commercial
league
our
political
relations
are
of
the
most
friendly
character
whilst
our
commercial
intercourse
is
gradually
extending
with
benefit
to
all
who
are
engaged
in
it
civil
war
yet
rages
in
spain
producing
intense
suffering
to
its
own
people
and
to
other
nations
inconvenience
and
regret
our
citizens
who
have
claims
upon
that
country
will
be
prejudiced
for
a
time
by
the
condition
of
its
treasury
the
inevitable
consequence
of
longcontinued
and
exhausting
internal
wars
the
last
installment
of
the
interest
of
the
debt
due
under
the
convention
with
the
queen
of
spain
has
not
been
paid
and
similar
failures
may
be
expected
to
happen
until
a
portion
of
the
resources
of
her
kingdom
can
be
devoted
to
the
extinguishment
of
its
foreign
debt
having
received
satisfactory
evidence
that
discriminating
tonnage
duties
were
charged
upon
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
in
the
ports
of
portugal
a
proclamation
was
issued
on
the
th
day
of
october
last
in
compliance
with
the
act
of
may
declaring
that
fact
and
the
duties
on
foreign
tonnage
which
were
levied
upon
portuguese
vessels
in
the
united
states
previously
to
the
passage
of
that
act
are
accordingly
revived
the
act
of
july
suspending
the
discriminating
duties
upon
the
produce
of
portugal
imported
into
this
country
in
portuguese
vessels
was
passed
upon
the
application
of
that
government
through
its
representative
here
under
the
belief
that
no
similar
discrimination
existed
in
portugal
to
the
prejudice
of
the
united
states
i
regret
to
state
that
such
duties
are
now
exacted
in
that
country
upon
the
cargoes
of
american
vessels
and
as
the
act
referred
to
vests
no
discretion
in
the
executive
it
is
for
congress
to
determine
upon
the
expediency
of
further
legislation
on
the
subject
against
these
discriminations
affecting
the
vessels
of
this
country
and
their
cargoes
seasonable
remonstrance
was
made
and
notice
was
given
to
the
portuguese
government
that
unless
they
should
be
discontinued
the
adoption
of
countervailing
measures
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
would
become
necessary
but
the
reply
of
that
government
received
at
the
department
of

our
charge

the
month
of

last
afforded
no
ground
to
hope
for
the
abandonment
of
a
system
so
l
ittle
in
harmony
with
the
treatment
shown
to
the
vessels
of
portugal
and
their
cargoes
in
the
ports
of
this
country
and
so
contrary
to
the
expectations
we
had
a
right
to
entertain
with
holland
sweden
denmark
naples
and
belgium
a
friendly
intercourse
has
been
uninterruptedly
maintained
with
the
government
of
the
ottoman
porte
and
its
dependencies
on
the
coast
of
the
mediterranean
peace
and
good
will
are
carefully
cultivated
and
have
been
fostered
by
such
good
offices
as
the
relative
distance
and
the
condition
of
those
countries
would
permit
our
commerce
with
greece
is
carried
on
under
the
laws
of
the
two
governments
reciprocally
beneficial
to
the
navigating
interests
of
both
and
i
have
reason
to
look
forward
to
the
adoption
of
other
measures
which
will
be
more
extensively
and
permanently
advantageous
copies
of
the
treaties
concluded
with
the
governments
of
siam
and
muscat
are
transmitted
for
the
information
of
congress
the
ratifications
having
been
received
and
the
treaties
made
public
since
the
close
of
the
last
annual
session
already
have
we
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
prospect
of
considerable
commercial
benefit
and
we
have
besides
received
from
the
sultan
of
muscat
prompt
evidence
of
his
desire
to
cultivate
the
most
friendly
feelings
by
liberal
acts
toward
one
of
our
vessels
bestowed
in
a
manner
so
striking
as
to
require
on
our
part
a
grateful
acknowledgment
our
commerce
with
the
islands
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
still
labors
under
heavy
restrictions
the
continuance
of
which
is
a
subject
of
regret
the
only
effect
of
an
adherence
to
them
will
be
to
benefit
the
navigation
of
other
countries
at
the
expense
of
both
the
united
states
and
spain
the
independent
nations
of
this
continent
have
ever
since
they
emerged
from
the
colonial
state
experienced
severe
trials
in
their
progress
to
the
permanent
establishment
of
liberal
political
institutions
their
unsettled
condition
not
only
interrupts
their
own
advances
to
prosperity
but
has
often
seriously
injured
the
other
powers
of
the
world
the
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
peru
chili
brazil
the
argentine
republic
the
governments
formed
out
of
the
republics
of
colombia
and
mexico
are
still
pending
although
many
of
them
have
been
presented
for
examination
more
than
twenty
years
new
granada
venezuela
and
ecuador
have
recently
formed
a
convention
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
and
adjusting
claims
upon
the
republic
of
colombia
from
which
it
is
earnestly
hoped
our
citizens
will
ere
long
receive
full
compensation
for
the
injuries
inflicted
upon
them
and
for
the
delay
in
affording
it
an
advantageous
treaty
of
commerce
has
been
concluded
by
the
united
states
with
the
perubolivian
confederation
which
wants
only
the
ratification
of
that
government
the
progress
of
a
subsequent
negotiation
for
the
settlement
of
claims
upon
peru
has
been
unfavorably
affected
by
the
war
between
that
power
and
chili
and
the
argentine
republic
and
the
same
event
is
also
likely
to
produce
delays
in
the
settlement
of
out
demands
on
those
powers
the
aggravating
circumstances
connected
with
our
claims
upon
mexico
and
a
variety
of
events
touching
the
honor
and
integrity
of
our
government
led
my
predecessor
to
make
at
the
second
session
of
the
last
congress
a
special
recommendation
of
the
course
to
be
pursued
to
obtain
a
speedy
and
final
satisfaction
of
the
injuries
complained
of
by
this
government
and
by
our
citizens
he
recommended
a
final
demand
of
redress
with
a
contingent
authority
to
the
executive
to
make
reprisals
if
that
demand
should
be
made
in
vain
from
the
proceedings
of
congress
on
that
recommendation
it
appeared
that
the
opinion
of
both
branches
of
the
legislature
coincided
with
that
of
the
executive
that
any
mode
of
redress
known
to
the
law
of
nations
might
justifiably
be
used
it
was
obvious
too
that
congress
believed
with
the
president
that
another
demand
should
be
made
in
order
to
give
undeniable
and
satisfactory
proof
of
our
desire
to
avoid
extremities
with
a
neighboring
power
but
that
there
was
an
indisposition
to
vest
a
discretionary
authority
in
the
executive
to
take
redress
should
it
unfortunately
be
either
denied
or
unreasonably
delayed
by
the
mexican
government
so
soon
as
the
necessary
documents
were
prepared
after
entering
upon
the
duties
of
my
office
a
special
messenger
was
sent
to
mexico
to
make
a
final
demand
of
redress
with
the
documents
required
by
the
provisions
of
our
treaty
the
demand
was
made
on
the
th
of
july
last
the
reply
which
bears
date
the
th
of
the
same
month
contains
assurances
of
a
desire
on
the
part
of
that
government
to
give
a
prompt
and
explicit
answer
respecting
each
of
the
complaints
but
that
the
examination
of
them
would
necessarily
be
deliberate
that
in
this
examination
it
would
be
guided
by
the
principles
of
public
law
and
the
obligation
of
treaties
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
that
might
lead
to
the
most
speedy
and
equitable
adjustment
of
our
demands
and
that
its
determination
in
respect
to
each
case
should
be
communicated
through
the
mexican
minister
here
since
that
time
an
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
has
been
accredited
to
this
government
by
that
of
the
mexican
republic
he
brought
with
him
assurances
of
a
sincere
desire
that
the
pending
differences
between
the
two
governments
should
be
terminated
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
both
he
was
received
with
reciprocal
assurances
and
a
hope
was
entertained
that
his
mission
would
lead
to
a
speedy
satisfactory
and
final
adjustment
of
all
existing
subjects
of
complaint
a
sincere
believer
in
the
wisdom
of
the
pacific
policy
by
which
the
united
states
have
always
been
governed
in
their
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
it
was
my
particular
desire
from
the
proximity
of
the
mexican
republic
and
wellknown
occurrences
on
our
frontier
to
be
instrumental
in
obviating
all
existing
difficulties
with
that
government
and
in
restoring
to
the
intercourse
between
the
two
republics
that
liberal
and
friendly
character
by
which
they
should
always
be
distinguished
i
regret
therefore
the
more
deeply
to
have
found
in
the
recent
communications
of
that
government
so
little
reason
to
hope
that
any
future
efforts
of
mine
for
the
accomplishment
of
those
desirable
objects
would
be
successful
although
the
larger
numberand
many
of
them
aggravated
cases
of
personal
wrongshave
been
now
for
years
before
the
mexican
government
and
some
of
the
causes
of
national
complaint
and
those
of
the
most
offensive
character
admitted
of
immediate
simple
and
satisfactory
replies
it
is
only
within
a
few
days
past
that
any
specific
communication
in
answer
to
our
last
demand
made
five
months
ago
has
been
received
from
the
mexican
minister
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
herewith
presented
and
the
accompanying
documents
it
will
be
seen
that
for
not
one
of
our
public
complaints
has
satisfaction
been
given
or
offered
that
but
one
of
the
cases
of
personal
wrong
has
been
favorably
considered
and
that
but
four
cases
of
both
descriptions
out
of
all
those
formally
presented
and
earnestly
pressed
have
as
yet
been
decided
upon
by
the
mexican
government
not
perceiving
in
what
manner
any
of
the
powers
given
to
the
executive
alone
could
be
further
usefully
employed
in
bringing
this
unfortunate
controversy
to
a
satisfactory
termination
the
subject
was
by
my
predecessor
referred
to
congress
as
one
calling
for
its
interposition
in
accordance
with
the
clearly
understood
wishes
of
the
legislature
another
and
formal
demand
for
satisfaction
has
been
made
upon
the
mexican
government
with
what
success
the
documents
now
communicated
will
show
on
a
careful
and
deliberate
examination
of
their
contents
and
considering
the
spirit
manifested
by
the
mexican
government
it
has
become
my
painful
duty
to
return
the
subject
as
it
now
stands
to
congress
to
whom
it
belongs
to
decide
upon
the
time
the
mode
and
the
measure
of
redress
whatever
may
be
your
decision
it
shall
be
faithfully
executed
confident
that
it
will
be
characterized
by
that
moderation
and
justice
which
will
i
trust
under
all
circumstances
govern
the
councils
of
our
country
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
january
was
the
receipts
during
the
present
year
from
all
sources
including
the
amount
of
treasury
notes
issued
are
estimated
at
constituting
an
aggregate
of
of
this
amount
about
will
have
been
expended
at
the
end
of
the
year
on
appropriations
made
by
congress
and
the
residue
amounting
to
will
be
the
nominal
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
january
next
but
of
that
sum
only
is
considered
as
immediately
available
for
and
applicable
to
public
purposes
those
portions
of
it
which
will
be
for
some
time
unavailable
consist
chiefly
of
sums
deposited
with
the
states
and
due
from
the
former
deposit
banks
the
details
upon
this
subject
will
be
found
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
amount
of
treasury
notes
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
issue
during
the
year
on
account
of
those
funds
being
unavailable
will
it
is
supposed
not
exceed
four
and
a
half
millions
it
seemed
proper
in
the
condition
of
the
country
to
have
the
estimates
on
all
subjects
made
as
low
as
practicable
without
prejudice
to
any
great
public
measures
the
departments
were
therefore
desired
to
prepare
their
estimates
accordingly
and
i
am
happy
to
find
that
they
have
been
able
to
graduate
them
on
so
economical
a
scale
in
the
great
and
often
unexpected
fluctuations
to
which
the
revenue
is
subjected
it
is
not
possible
to
compute
the
receipts
beforehand
with
great
certainty
but
should
they
not
differ
essentially
from
present
anticipations
and
should
the
appropriations
not
much
exceed
the
estimates
no
difficulty
seems
likely
to
happen
in
defraying
the
current
expenses
with
promptitude
and
fidelity
notwithstanding
the
great
embarrassments
which
have
recently
occurred
in
commercial
affairs
and
the
liberal
indulgence
which
in
consequence
of
these
embarrassments
has
been
extended
to
both
the
merchants
and
the
banks
it
is
gratifying
to
be
able
to
anticipate
that
the
treasury
notes
which
have
been
issued
during
the
presen
t
year
will
be
redeemed
and
that
the
resources
of
the
treasury
without
any
resort
to
loans
or
increased
taxes
will
prove
ample
for
defraying
all
charges
imposed
on
it
during
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
afford
you
a
more
minute
exposition
of
all
matters
connected
with
the
administration
of
the
finances
during
the
current
yeara
period
which
for
the
amount
of
public
moneys
disbursed
and
deposited
with
the
states
as
well
as
the
financial
difficulties
encountered
and
overcome
has
few
parallels
in
our
history
your
attention
was
at
the
last
session
invited
to
the
necessity
of
additional
legislative
provisions
in
respect
to
the
collection
safekeeping
and
transfer
of
the
public
money
no
law
having
been
then
matured
and
not
understanding
the
proceedings
of
congress
as
intended
to
be
final
it
becomes
my
duty
again
to
bring
the
subject
to
your
notice
on
that
occasion
three
modes
of
performing
this
branch
of
the
public
service
were
presented
for
consideration
these
were
the
creation
of
a
national
bank
the
revival
with
modifications
of
the
deposit
system
established
by
the
act
of
the
d
of
june
permitting
the
use
of
the
public
moneys
by
the
banks
and
the
discontinuance
of
the
use
of
such
institutions
for
the
purposes
referred
to
with
suitable
provisions
for
their
accomplishment
through
the
agency
of
public
officers
considering
the
opinions
of
both
houses
of
congress
on
the
first
two
propositions
as
expressed
in
the
negative
in
which
i
entirely
concur
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
again
in
to
recur
to
them
in
respect
to
the
last
you
have
had
an
opportunity
since
your
adjournment
not
only
to
test
still
further
the
expediency
of
the
measure
by
the
continued
practical
operation
of
such
parts
of
it
as
are
now
in
force
but
also
to
discover
what
should
ever
be
sought
for
and
regarded
with
the
utmost
deferencethe
opinions
and
wishes
of
the
people
the
national
will
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
republic
and
on
all
subjects
within
the
limits
of
his
constitutional
powers
should
be
faithfully
obeyed
by
the
public
servant
since
the
measure
in
question
was
submitted
to
your
consideration
most
of
you
have
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
personal
communication
with
your
constituents
for
one
state
only
has
an
election
been
held
for
the
federal
government
but
the
early
day
at
which
it
took
place
deprived
the
measure
under
consideration
of
much
of
the
support
it
might
otherwise
have
derived
from
the
result
local
elections
for
state
officers
have
however
been
held
in
several
of
the
states
at
which
the
expediency
of
the
plan
proposed
by
the
executive
has
been
more
or
less
discussed
you
will
i
am
confident
yield
to
their
results
the
respect
due
to
every
expression
of
the
public
voice
desiring
however
to
arrive
at
truth
and
a
just
view
of
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
you
will
at
the
same
time
remember
that
questions
of
far
deeper
and
more
immediate
local
interest
than
the
fiscal
plans
of
the
national
treasury
were
involved
in
those
elections
above
all
we
can
not
overlook
the
striking
fact
that
there
were
at
the
time
in
those
states
more
than
one
hundred
and
sixty
millions
of
bank
capital
of
which
large
portions
were
subject
to
actual
forfeiture
other
large
portions
upheld
only
by
special
and
limited
legislative
indulgences
and
most
of
it
if
not
all
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
dependent
for
a
continuance
of
its
corporate
existence
upon
the
will
of
the
state
legislatures
to
be
then
chosen
apprised
of
this
circumstance
you
will
judge
whether
it
is
not
most
probable
that
the
peculiar
condition
of
that
vast
interest
in
these
respects
the
extent
to
which
it
has
been
spread
through
all
the
ramifications
of
society
its
direct
connection
with
the
then
pending
elections
and
the
feelings
it
was
calculated
to
infuse
into
the
canvass
have
exercised
a
far
greater
influence
over
the
result
than
any
which
could
possibly
have
been
produced
by
a
conflict
of
opinion
in
respect
to
a
question
in
the
administration
of
the
general
government
more
remote
and
far
less
important
in
its
bearings
upon
that
interest
i
have
found
no
reason
to
change
my
own
opinion
as
to
the
expediency
of
adopting
the
system
proposed
being
perfectly
satisfied
that
there
will
be
neither
stability
nor
safety
either
in
the
fiscal
affairs
of
the
government
or
in
the
pecuniary
transactions
of
individuals
and
corporations
so
long
as
a
connection
exists
between
them
which
like
the
past
offers
such
strong
inducements
to
make
them
the
subjects
of
political
agitation
indeed
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
of
the
dangers
to
which
the
free
and
unbiased
exercise
of
political
opinionthe
only
sure
foundation
and
safeguard
of
republican
governmentwould
be
exposed
by
any
further
increase
of
the
already
overgrown
influence
of
corporate
authorities
i
can
not
therefore
consistently
with
my
views
of
duty
advise
a
renewal
of
a
connection
which
circumstances
have
dissolved
the
discontinuance
of
the
use
of
state
banks
for
fiscal
purposes
ought
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
measure
of
hostility
toward
those
institutions
banks
properly
established
and
conducted
are
highly
useful
to
the
business
of
the
country
and
will
doubtless
continue
to
exist
in
the
states
so
long
as
they
conform
to
their
laws
and
are
found
to
be
safe
and
beneficial
how
they
should
be
created
what
privileges
they
should
enjoy
under
what
responsibilities
they
should
act
and
to
what
restrictions
they
should
be
subject
are
questions
which
as
i
observed
on
a
previous
occasion
belong
to
the
states
to
decide
upon
their
rights
or
the
exercise
of
them
the
general
government
can
have
no
motive
to
encroach
its
duty
toward
them
is
well
performed
when
it
refrains
from
legislating
for
their
special
benefit
because
such
legislation
would
violate
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
be
unjust
to
other
interests
when
it
takes
no
steps
to
impair
their
usefulness
but
so
manages
its
own
affairs
as
to
make
it
the
interest
of
those
institutions
to
strengthen
and
improve
their
condition
for
the
security
and
welfare
of
the
community
at
large
they
have
no
right
to
insist
on
a
connection
with
the
federal
government
nor
on
the
use
of
the
public
money
for
their
own
benefit
the
object
of
the
measure
under
consideration
is
to
avoid
for
the
future
a
compulsory
connection
of
this
kind
it
proposes
to
place
the
general
government
in
regard
to
the
essential
points
of
the
collection
safekeeping
and
transfer
of
the
public
money
in
a
situation
which
shall
relieve
it
from
all
dependence
on
the
will
of
irresponsible
individuals
or
corporations
to
withdraw
those
moneys
from
the
uses
of
private
trade
and
confide
them
to
agents
constitutionally
selected
and
controlled
by
law
to
abstain
from
improper
interference
with
the
industry
of
the
people
and
withhold
inducements
to
improvident
dealings
on
the
part
of
individuals
to
give
stability
to
the
concerns
of
the
treasury
to
preserve
the
measures
of
the
government
from
the
unavoidable
reproaches
that
flow
from
such
a
connection
and
the
banks
themselves
from
the
injurious
effects
of
a
supposed
participation
in
the
political
conflicts
of
the
day
from
which
they
will
otherwise
find
it
difficult
to
escape
these
are
my
views
upon
this
important
subject
formed
after
careful
reflection
and
with
no
desire
but
to
arrive
at
what
is
most
likely
to
promote
the
public
interest
they
are
now
as
they
were
before
submitted
with
unfeigned
deference
for
the
opinions
of
others
it
was
hardly
to
be
hoped
that
changes
so
important
on
a
subject
so
interesting
could
be
made
without
producing
a
serious
diversity
of
opinion
but
so
long
as
those
conflicting
views
are
kept
above
the
influence
of
individual
or
local
interests
so
long
as
they
pursue
only
the
general
good
and
are
discussed
with
moderation
and
candor
such
diversity
is
a
benefit
not
an
injury
if
a
majority
of
congress
see
the
public
welfare
in
a
different
light
and
more
especially
if
they
should
be
satisfied
that
the
measure
proposed
would
not
be
acceptable
to
the
people
i
shall
look
to
their
wisdom
to
substitute
such
as
may
be
more
conducive
to
the
one
and
more
satisfactory
to
the
other
in
any
event
they
may
confidently
rely
on
my
hearty
cooperation
to
the
fullest
extent
to
which
my
views
of
the
constitution
and
my
sense
of
duty
will
permit
it
is
obviously
important
to
this
branch
of
the
public
service
and
to
the
business
and
quiet
of
the
country
that
the
whole
subject
should
in
some
way
be
settled
and
regulated
by
law
and
if
possible
at
your
present
session
besides
the
plans
above
referred
to
i
am
not
aware
that
any
one
has
been
suggested
except
that
of
keeping
the
public
money
in
the
state
banks
in
special
deposit
this
plan
is
to
some
extent
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
government
and
with
the
present
arrangements
of
the
treasury
department
which
except
perhaps
during
the
operation
of
the
late
deposit
act
has
always
been
allowed
even
during
the
existence
of
a
national
bank
to
make
a
temporary
use
of
the
state
banks
in
particular
places
for
the
safekeeping
of
portions
of
the
revenue
this
discretionary
power
might
be
continued
if
congress
deem
it
desirable
whatever
general
system
be
adopted
so
long
as
the
connection
is
voluntary
we
need
perhaps
anticipate
few
of
those
difficulties
and
little
of
that
dependence
on
the
banks
which
must
attend
every
such
connection
when
compulsory
in
its
nature
and
when
so
arranged
as
to
make
the
banks
a
fixed
part
of
the
machinery
of
government
it
is
undoubtedly
in
the
power
of
congress
so
to
regulate
and
guard
it
as
to
prevent
the
public
money
from
being
applied
to
the
use
or
intermingled
with
the
affairs
of
individuals
thus
arranged
although
it
would
not
give
to
the
government
that
entire
control
over
its
own
funds
which
i
desire
to
secure
to
it
by
the
plan
i
have
proposed
it
would
it
must
be
admitted
in
a
great
degree
accomplish
one
of
the
objects
which
has
recommended
that
plan
to
my
judgmentthe
separation
of
the
fiscal
concerns
of
the
government
from
those
of
individuals
or
corporations
with
these
observations
i
recommend
the
whole
matter
to
your
dispassionate
refle
ction
confidently
hoping
that
some
conclusion
may
be
reached
by
your
deliberations
which
on
the
one
hand
shall
give
safety
and
stability
to
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
and
be
consistent
on
the
other
with
the
genius
of
our
institutions
and
with
the
interests
and
wishes
of
the
great
mass
of
our
constituents
it
was
my
hope
that
nothing
would
occur
to
make
necessary
on
this
occasion
any
allusion
to
the
late
national
bank
there
are
circumstances
however
connected
with
the
present
state
of
its
affairs
that
bear
so
directly
on
the
character
of
the
government
and
the
welfare
of
the
citizen
that
i
should
not
feel
myself
excused
in
neglecting
to
notice
them
the
charter
which
terminated
its
banking
privileges
on
the
th
of
march
continued
its
corporate
power
two
years
more
for
the
sole
purpose
of
closing
its
affairs
with
authority
to
use
the
corporate
name
style
and
capacity
for
the
purpose
of
suits
for
a
final
settlement
and
liquidation
of
the
affairs
and
acts
of
the
corporation
and
for
the
sale
and
disposition
of
their
estatereal
personal
and
mixedbut
for
no
other
purpose
or
in
any
other
manner
whatsoever
just
before
the
banking
privileges
ceased
its
effects
were
transferred
by
the
bank
to
a
new
state
institution
then
recently
incorporated
in
trust
for
the
discharge
of
its
debts
and
the
settlement
of
its
affairs
with
this
trustee
by
authority
of
congress
an
adjustment
was
subsequently
made
of
the
large
interest
which
the
government
had
in
the
stock
of
the
institution
the
manner
in
which
a
trust
unexpectedly
created
upon
the
act
granting
the
charter
and
involving
such
great
public
interests
has
been
executed
would
under
any
circumstances
be
a
fit
subject
of
inquiry
but
much
more
does
it
deserve
your
attention
when
it
embraces
the
redemption
of
obligations
to
which
the
authority
and
credit
of
the
united
states
have
given
value
the
two
years
allowed
are
now
nearly
at
an
end
it
is
well
understood
that
the
trustee
has
not
redeemed
and
canceled
the
outstanding
notes
of
the
bank
but
has
reissued
and
is
actually
reissuing
since
the
d
of
march
the
notes
which
have
been
received
by
it
to
a
vast
amount
according
to
its
own
official
statement
so
late
as
the
st
of
october
last
nineteen
months
after
the
banking
privileges
given
by
the
charter
had
expired
it
had
under
its
control
uncanceled
notes
of
the
late
bank
of
the
united
states
to
the
amount
of
of
which
were
in
actual
circulation
at
state
bank
agencies
and
in
transitu
thus
showing
that
upward
of
ten
millions
and
a
half
of
the
notes
of
the
old
bank
were
then
still
kept
outstanding
the
impropriety
of
this
procedure
is
obvious
it
being
the
duty
of
the
trustee
to
cancel
and
not
to
put
forth
the
notes
of
an
institution
whose
concerns
it
had
undertaken
to
wind
up
if
the
trustee
has
a
right
to
reissue
these
notes
now
i
can
see
no
reason
why
it
may
not
continue
to
do
so
after
the
expiration
of
the
two
years
as
no
one
could
have
anticipated
a
course
so
extraordinary
the
prohibitory
clause
of
the
charter
above
quoted
was
not
accompanied
by
any
penalty
or
other
special
provision
for
enforcing
it
nor
have
we
any
general
law
for
the
prevention
of
similar
acts
in
future
but
it
is
not
in
this
view
of
the
subject
alone
that
your
interposition
is
required
the
united
states
in
settling
with
the
trustee
for
their
stock
have
withdrawn
their
funds
from
their
former
direct
liability
to
the
creditors
of
the
old
bank
yet
notes
of
the
institution
continue
to
be
sent
forth
in
its
name
and
apparently
upon
the
authority
of
the
united
states
the
transactions
connected
with
the
employment
of
the
bills
of
the
old
bank
are
of
vast
extent
and
should
they
result
unfortunately
the
interests
of
individuals
may
be
deeply
compromised
without
undertaking
to
decide
how
far
or
in
what
form
if
any
the
trustee
could
be
made
liable
for
notes
which
contain
no
obligation
on
its
part
or
the
old
bank
for
such
as
are
put
in
circulation
after
the
expiration
of
its
charter
and
without
its
authority
or
the
government
for
indemnity
in
case
of
loss
the
question
still
presses
itself
upon
your
consideration
whether
it
is
consistent
with
duty
and
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
witness
this
proceeding
without
a
single
effort
to
arrest
it
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
which
will
be
laid
before
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
show
how
the
affairs
of
that
office
have
been
conducted
for
the
past
year
the
disposition
of
the
public
lands
is
one
of
the
most
important
trusts
confided
to
congress
the
practicability
of
retaining
the
title
and
control
of
such
extensive
domains
in
the
general
government
and
at
the
same
time
admitting
the
territories
embracing
them
into
the
federal
union
as
coequals
with
the
original
states
was
seriously
doubted
by
many
of
our
wisest
statesmen
all
feared
that
they
would
become
a
source
of
discord
and
many
carried
their
apprehensions
so
far
as
to
see
in
them
the
seeds
of
a
future
dissolution
of
the
confederacy
but
happily
our
experience
has
already
been
sufficient
to
quiet
in
a
great
degree
all
such
apprehensions
the
position
at
one
time
assumed
that
the
admission
of
new
states
into
the
union
on
the
same
footing
with
the
original
states
was
incompatible
with
a
right
of
soil
in
the
united
states
and
operated
as
a
surrender
thereof
notwithstanding
the
terms
of
the
compacts
by
which
their
admission
was
designed
to
be
regulated
has
been
wisely
abandoned
whether
in
the
new
or
the
old
states
all
now
agree
that
the
right
of
soil
to
the
public
lands
remains
in
the
federal
government
and
that
these
lands
constitute
a
common
property
to
be
disposed
of
for
the
common
benefit
of
all
the
states
old
and
new
acquiescence
in
this
just
principle
by
the
people
of
the
new
states
has
naturally
promoted
a
disposition
to
adopt
the
most
liberal
policy
in
the
sale
of
the
public
lands
a
policy
which
should
be
limited
to
the
mere
object
of
selling
the
lands
for
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
money
without
regard
to
higher
considerations
finds
but
few
advocates
on
the
contrary
it
is
generally
conceded
that
whilst
the
mode
of
disposition
adopted
by
the
government
should
always
be
a
prudent
one
yet
its
leading
object
ought
to
be
the
early
settlement
and
cultivation
of
the
lands
sold
and
that
it
should
discountenance
if
it
can
not
prevent
the
accumulation
of
large
tracts
in
the
same
hands
which
must
necessarily
retard
the
growth
of
the
new
states
or
entail
upon
them
a
dependent
tenantry
and
its
attendant
evils
a
question
embracing
such
important
interests
and
so
well
calculated
to
enlist
the
feelings
of
the
people
in
every
quarter
of
the
union
has
very
naturally
given
rise
to
numerous
plans
for
the
improvement
of
the
existing
system
the
distinctive
features
of
the
policy
that
has
hitherto
prevailed
are
to
dispose
of
the
public
lands
at
moderate
prices
thus
enabling
a
greater
number
to
enter
into
competition
for
their
purchase
and
accomplishing
a
double
objectof
promoting
their
rapid
settlement
by
the
purchasers
and
at
the
same
time
increasing
the
receipts
of
the
treasury
to
sell
for
cash
thereby
preventing
the
disturbing
influence
of
a
large
mass
of
private
citizens
indebted
to
the
government
which
they
have
a
voice
in
controlling
to
bring
them
into
market
no
faster
than
good
lands
are
supposed
to
be
wanted
for
improvement
thereby
preventing
the
accumulation
of
large
tracts
in
few
hands
and
to
apply
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
to
the
general
purposes
of
the
government
thus
diminishing
the
amount
to
be
raised
from
the
people
of
the
states
by
taxation
and
giving
each
state
its
portion
of
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
this
common
fund
in
a
manner
the
most
quiet
and
at
the
same
time
perhaps
the
most
equitable
that
can
be
devised
these
provisions
with
occasional
enactments
in
behalf
of
special
interests
deemed
entitled
to
the
favor
of
the
government
have
in
their
execution
produced
results
as
beneficial
upon
the
whole
as
could
reasonably
be
expected
in
a
matter
so
vast
so
complicated
and
so
exciting
upward
of
acres
have
been
sold
the
greater
part
of
which
is
believed
to
have
been
purchased
for
actual
settlement
the
population
of
the
new
states
and
territories
created
out
of
the
public
domain
increased
between
and
from
less
than
to
upward
of
souls
constituting
at
the
latter
period
about
onefifth
of
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
the
increase
since
can
not
be
accurately
known
but
the
whole
may
now
be
safely
estimated
at
over
three
and
a
half
millions
of
souls
composing
nine
states
the
representatives
of
which
constitute
above
onethird
of
the
senate
and
over
onesixth
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
united
states
thus
has
been
formed
a
body
of
free
and
independent
landholders
with
a
rapidity
unequaled
in
the
history
of
mankind
and
this
great
result
has
been
produced
without
leaving
anything
for
future
adjustment
between
the
government
and
its
citizens
the
system
under
which
so
much
has
been
accomplished
can
not
be
intrinsically
bad
and
with
occasional
modifications
to
correct
abuses
and
adapt
it
to
changes
of
circumstances
may
i
think
be
safely
trusted
for
the
future
there
is
in
the
management
of
such
extensive
interests
much
virtue
in
stability
and
although
great
and
obvious
improvements
should
not
be
declined
changes
should
never
be
made
without
the
fullest
examination
and
the
clearest
demonstration
of
their
practical
utility
in
the
history
of
the
past
we
have
an
assurance
that
this
safe
rule
of
action
will
not
be
departed
from
in
relation
to
the
public
lands
nor
is
it
believed
that
any
necessity
exists
for
interfering
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
system
or
that
the
public
mind
even
in
the
new
states
is
desirous
of
any
radical
alterations
on
the
contrary
the
general
disposition
appears
to
be
to
make
such
modifications
and
additions
only
as
will
the
more
effectually
carry
out
the
original
policy
of
filling
our
new
states
and
territories
with
an
industrious
and
independent
population
the
modification
most
perseveringly
pressed
upon
congress
which
has
occupied
so
much
o
f
its
time
for
years
past
and
will
probably
do
so
for
a
long
time
to
come
if
not
sooner
satisfactorily
adjusted
is
a
reduction
in
the
cost
of
such
portions
of
the
public
lands
as
are
ascertained
to
be
unsalable
at
the
rate
now
established
by
law
and
a
graduation
according
to
their
relative
value
of
the
prices
at
which
they
may
hereafter
be
sold
it
is
worthy
of
consideration
whether
justice
may
not
be
done
to
every
interest
in
this
matter
and
a
vexed
question
set
at
rest
perhaps
forever
by
a
reasonable
compromise
of
conflicting
opinions
hitherto
after
being
offered
at
public
sale
lands
have
been
disposed
of
at
one
uniform
price
whatever
difference
there
might
be
in
their
intrinsic
value
the
leading
considerations
urged
in
favor
of
the
measure
referred
to
are
that
in
almost
all
the
land
districts
and
particularly
in
those
in
which
the
lands
have
been
long
surveyed
and
exposed
to
sale
there
are
still
remaining
numerous
and
large
tracts
of
every
gradation
of
value
from
the
government
price
downward
that
these
lands
will
not
be
purchased
at
the
government
price
so
long
as
better
can
be
conveniently
obtained
for
the
same
amount
that
there
are
large
tracts
which
even
the
improvements
of
the
adjacent
lands
will
never
raise
to
that
price
and
that
the
present
uniform
price
combined
with
their
irregular
value
operates
to
prevent
a
desirable
compactness
of
settlements
in
the
new
states
and
to
retard
the
full
development
of
that
wise
policy
on
which
our
land
system
is
founded
to
the
injury
not
only
of
the
several
states
where
the
lands
lie
but
of
the
united
states
as
a
whole
the
remedy
proposed
has
been
a
reduction
of
the
prices
according
to
the
length
of
time
the
lands
have
been
in
market
without
reference
to
any
other
circumstances
the
certainty
that
the
efflux
of
time
would
not
always
in
such
cases
and
perhaps
not
even
generally
furnish
a
true
criterion
of
value
and
the
probability
that
persons
residing
in
the
vicinity
as
the
period
for
the
reduction
of
prices
approached
would
postpone
purchases
they
would
otherwise
make
for
the
purpose
of
availing
themselves
of
the
lower
price
with
other
considerations
of
a
similar
character
have
hitherto
been
successfully
urged
to
defeat
the
graduation
upon
time
may
not
all
reasonable
desires
upon
this
subject
be
satisfied
without
encountering
any
of
these
objections
all
will
concede
the
abstract
principle
that
the
price
of
the
public
lands
should
be
proportioned
to
their
relative
value
so
far
as
can
be
accomplished
without
departing
from
the
rule
heretofore
observed
requiring
fixed
prices
in
cases
of
private
entries
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
seems
to
lie
in
the
mode
of
ascertaining
what
that
value
is
would
not
the
safest
plan
be
that
which
has
been
adopted
by
many
of
the
states
as
the
basis
of
taxationan
actual
valuation
of
lands
and
classification
of
them
into
different
rates
would
it
not
be
practicable
and
expedient
to
cause
the
relative
value
of
the
public
lands
in
the
old
districts
which
have
been
for
a
certain
length
of
time
in
market
to
be
appraised
and
classed
into
two
or
more
rates
below
the
present
minimum
price
by
the
officers
now
employed
in
this
branch
of
the
public
service
or
in
any
other
mode
deemed
preferable
and
to
make
those
prices
permanent
if
upon
the
coming
in
of
the
report
they
shall
prove
satisfactory
to
congress
could
not
all
the
objects
of
graduation
be
accomplished
in
this
way
and
the
objections
which
have
hitherto
been
urged
against
it
avoided
it
would
seem
to
me
that
such
a
step
with
a
restriction
of
the
sales
to
limited
quantities
and
for
actual
improvement
would
be
free
from
all
just
exception
by
the
full
exposition
of
the
value
of
the
lands
thus
furnished
and
extensively
promulgated
persons
living
at
a
distance
would
be
informed
of
their
true
condition
and
enabled
to
enter
into
competition
with
those
residing
in
the
vicinity
the
means
of
acquiring
an
independent
home
would
be
brought
within
the
reach
of
many
who
are
unable
to
purchase
at
present
prices
the
population
of
the
new
states
would
be
made
more
compact
and
large
tracts
would
be
sold
which
would
otherwise
remain
on
hand
not
only
would
the
land
be
brought
within
the
means
of
a
larger
number
of
purchasers
but
many
persons
possessed
of
greater
means
would
be
content
to
settle
on
a
larger
quantity
of
the
poorer
lands
rather
than
emigrate
farther
west
in
pursuit
of
a
smaller
quantity
of
better
lands
such
a
measure
would
also
seem
to
be
more
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
existing
lawsthat
of
converting
the
public
domain
into
cultivated
farms
owned
by
their
occupants
that
policy
is
not
best
promoted
by
sending
emigration
up
the
almost
interminable
streams
of
the
west
to
occupy
in
groups
the
best
spots
of
land
leaving
immense
wastes
behind
them
and
enlarging
the
frontier
beyond
the
means
of
the
government
to
afford
it
adequate
protection
but
in
encouraging
it
to
occupy
with
reasonable
denseness
the
territory
over
which
it
advances
and
find
its
best
defense
in
the
compact
front
which
it
presents
to
the
indian
tribes
many
of
you
will
bring
to
the
consideration
of
the
subject
the
advantages
of
local
knowledge
and
greater
experience
and
all
will
be
desirous
of
making
an
early
and
final
disposition
of
every
disturbing
question
in
regard
to
this
important
interest
if
these
suggestions
shall
in
any
degree
contribute
to
the
accomplishment
of
so
important
a
result
it
will
afford
me
sincere
satisfaction
in
some
sections
of
the
country
most
of
the
public
lands
have
been
sold
and
the
registers
and
receivers
have
very
little
to
do
it
is
a
subject
worthy
of
inquiry
whether
in
many
cases
two
or
more
districts
may
not
be
consolidated
and
the
number
of
persons
employed
in
this
business
considerably
reduced
indeed
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
be
the
true
policy
of
the
general
government
as
to
some
of
the
states
to
transfer
to
them
for
a
reasonable
equivalent
all
the
refuse
and
unsold
lands
and
to
withdraw
the
machinery
of
the
federal
land
offices
altogether
all
who
take
a
comprehensive
view
of
our
federal
system
and
believe
that
one
of
its
greatest
excellencies
consists
in
interfering
as
little
as
possible
with
the
internal
concerns
of
the
states
look
forward
with
great
interest
to
this
result
a
modification
of
the
existing
laws
in
respect
to
the
prices
of
the
public
lands
might
also
have
a
favorable
influence
on
the
legislation
of
congress
in
relation
to
another
branch
of
the
subject
many
who
have
not
the
ability
to
buy
at
present
prices
settle
on
those
lands
with
the
hope
of
acquiring
from
their
cultivation
the
means
of
purchasing
under
preemption
laws
from
time
to
time
passed
by
congress
for
this
encroachment
on
the
rights
of
the
united
states
they
excuse
themselves
under
the
plea
of
their
own
necessities
the
fact
that
they
dispossess
nobody
and
only
enter
upon
the
waste
domain
that
they
give
additional
value
to
the
public
lands
in
their
vicinity
and
their
intention
ultimately
to
pay
the
government
price
so
much
weight
has
from
time
to
time
been
attached
to
these
considerations
that
congress
have
passed
laws
giving
actual
settlers
on
the
public
lands
a
right
of
preemption
to
the
tracts
occupied
by
them
at
the
minimum
price
these
laws
have
in
all
instances
been
retrospective
in
their
operation
but
in
a
few
years
after
their
passage
crowds
of
new
settlers
have
been
found
on
the
public
lands
for
similar
reasons
and
under
like
expectations
who
have
been
indulged
with
the
same
privilege
this
course
of
legislation
tends
to
impair
public
respect
for
the
laws
of
the
country
either
the
laws
to
prevent
intrusion
upon
the
public
lands
should
be
executed
or
if
that
should
be
impracticable
or
inexpedient
they
should
be
modified
or
repealed
if
the
public
lands
are
to
be
considered
as
open
to
be
occupied
by
any
they
should
by
law
be
thrown
open
to
all
that
which
is
intended
in
all
instances
to
be
legalized
should
at
once
be
made
legal
that
those
who
are
disposed
to
conform
to
the
laws
may
enjoy
at
least
equal
privileges
with
those
who
are
not
but
it
is
not
believed
to
be
the
disposition
of
congress
to
open
the
public
lands
to
occupancy
without
regular
entry
and
payment
of
the
government
price
as
such
a
course
must
tend
to
worse
evils
than
the
credit
system
which
it
was
found
necessary
to
abolish
it
would
seem
therefore
to
be
the
part
of
wisdom
and
sound
policy
to
remove
as
far
as
practicable
the
causes
which
produce
intrusions
upon
the
public
lands
and
then
take
efficient
steps
to
prevent
them
in
future
would
any
single
measure
be
so
effective
in
removing
all
plausible
grounds
for
these
intrusions
as
the
graduation
of
price
already
suggested
a
short
period
of
industry
and
economy
in
any
part
of
our
country
would
enable
the
poorest
citizen
to
accumulate
the
means
to
buy
him
a
home
at
the
lower
prices
and
leave
him
without
apology
for
settling
on
lands
not
his
own
if
he
did
not
under
such
circumstances
he
would
enlist
no
sympathy
in
his
favor
and
the
laws
would
be
readily
executed
without
doing
violence
to
public
opinion
a
large
portion
of
our
citizens
have
seated
themselves
on
the
public
lands
without
authority
since
the
passage
of
the
last
preemption
law
and
now
ask
the
enactment
of
another
to
enable
them
to
retain
the
lands
occupied
upon
payment
of
the
minimum
government
price
they
ask
that
which
has
been
repeatedly
granted
before
if
the
future
may
be
judged
of
by
the
past
little
harm
can
be
done
to
the
interests
of
the
treasury
by
yielding
to
their
request
upon
a
critical
examination
it
is
found
that
the
lands
sold
at
the
public
sales
since
the
introduction
of
cash
payments
in
have
produced
on
an
average
the
net
revenue
of
only
cents
an
acre
more
than
the
minimum
government
price
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
future
sales
will
be
more
productive
the
government
therefore
has
no
adequate
pecuniary
interest
to
induce
it
to
drive
these
people
from
the
lands
they
occupy
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them
to
others
entertaining
these
views
i
recommend
the
passage
of
a
preemption
law
for
their
benefit
in
connection
with
the

preparatory
steps
toward
the
graduation
of
the
price
of
the
public
lands
and
further
and
more
effectual
provisions
to
prevent
intrusions
hereafter
indulgence
to
those
who
have
settled
on
these
lands
with
expectations
that
past
legislation
would
be
made
a
rule
for
the
future
and
at
the
same
time
removing
the
most
plausible
ground
on
which
intrusions
are
excused
and
adopting
more
efficient
means
to
prevent
them
hereafter
appears
to
me
the
most
judicious
disposition
which
can
be
made
of
this
difficult
subject
the
limitations
and
restrictions
to
guard
against
abuses
in
the
execution
of
a
preemption
law
will
necessarily
attract
the
careful
attention
of
congress
but
under
no
circumstances
is
it
considered
expedient
to
authorize
floating
claims
in
any
shape
they
have
been
heretofore
and
doubtless
would
be
hereafter
most
prolific
sources
of
fraud
and
oppression
and
instead
of
operating
to
confer
the
favor
of
the
government
on
industrious
settlers
are
often
used
only
to
minister
to
a
spirit
of
cupidity
at
the
expense
of
the
most
meritorious
of
that
class
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
will
bring
to
your
view
the
state
of
the
army
and
all
the
various
subjects
confided
to
the
superintendence
of
that
officer
the
principal
part
of
the
army
has
been
concentrated
in
florida
with
a
view
and
in
the
expectation
of
bringing
the
war
in
that
territory
to
a
speedy
close
the
necessity
of
stripping
the
posts
on
the
maritime
and
inland
frontiers
of
their
entire
garrisons
for
the
purpose
of
assembling
in
the
field
an
army
of
less
than
men
would
seem
to
indicate
the
necessity
of
increasing
our
regular
forces
and
the
superior
efficiency
as
well
as
greatly
diminished
expense
of
that
description
of
troops
recommend
this
measure
as
one
of
economy
as
well
as
of
expediency
i
refer
to
the
report
for
the
reasons
which
have
induced
the
secretary
of
war
to
urge
the
reorganization
and
enlargement
of
the
staff
of
the
army
and
of
the
ordnance
corps
in
which
i
fully
concur
it
is
not
however
compatible
with
the
interests
of
the
people
to
maintain
in
time
of
peace
a
regular
force
adequate
to
the
defense
of
our
extensive
frontiers
in
periods
of
danger
and
alarm
we
must
rely
principally
upon
a
wellorganized
militia
and
some
general
arrangement
that
will
render
this
description
of
force
more
efficient
has
long
been
a
subject
of
anxious
solicitude
it
was
recommended
to
the
first
congress
by
general
washington
and
has
been
since
frequently
brought
to
your
notice
and
recently
its
importance
strongly
urged
by
my
immediate
predecessor
the
provision
in
the
constitution
that
renders
it
necessary
to
adopt
a
uniform
system
of
organization
for
the
militia
throughout
the
united
states
presents
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
an
efficient
arrangement
by
the
classification
heretofore
proposed
and
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
plan
which
will
be
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
war
for
the
organization
of
volunteer
corps
and
the
instruction
of
militia
officers
as
more
simple
and
practicable
if
not
equally
advantageous
as
a
general
arrangement
of
the
whole
militia
of
the
united
states
a
moderate
increase
of
the
corps
both
of
military
and
topographical
engineers
has
been
more
than
once
recommended
by
my
predecessor
and
my
conviction
of
the
propriety
not
to
say
necessity
of
the
measure
in
order
to
enable
them
to
perform
the
various
and
important
duties
imposed
upon
them
induces
me
to
repeat
the
recommendation
the
military
academy
continues
to
answer
all
the
purposes
of
its
establishment
and
not
only
furnishes
welleducated
officers
to
the
army
but
serves
to
diffuse
throughout
the
mass
of
our
citizens
individuals
possessed
of
military
knowledge
and
the
scientific
attainments
of
civil
and
military
engineering
at
present
the
cadet
is
bound
with
consent
of
his
parents
or
guardians
to
remain
in
service
five
years
from
the
period
of
his
enlistment
unless
sooner
discharged
thus
exacting
only
one
years
service
in
the
army
after
his
education
is
completed
this
does
not
appear
to
me
sufficient
government
ought
to
command
for
a
longer
period
the
services
of
those
who
are
educated
at
the
public
expense
and
i
recommend
that
the
time
of
enlistment
be
extended
to
seven
years
and
the
terms
of
the
engagement
strictly
enforced
the
creation
of
a
national
foundry
for
cannon
to
be
common
to
the
service
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
has
been
heretofore
recommended
and
appears
to
be
required
in
order
to
place
our
ordnance
on
an
equal
footing
with
that
of
other
countries
and
to
enable
that
branch
of
the
service
to
control
the
prices
of
those
articles
and
graduate
the
supplies
to
the
wants
of
the
government
as
well
as
to
regulate
their
quality
and
insure
their
uniformity
the
same
reasons
induce
me
to
recommend
the
erection
of
a
manufactory
of
gunpowder
to
be
under
the
direction
of
the
ordnance
office
the
establishment
of
a
manufactory
of
small
arms
west
of
the
alleghany
mountains
upon
the
plan
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
war
will
contribute
to
extend
throughout
that
country
the
improvements
which
exist
in
establishments
of
a
similar
description
in
the
atlantic
states
and
tend
to
a
much
more
economical
distribution
of
the
armament
required
in
the
western
portion
of
our
union
the
system
of
removing
the
indians
west
of
the
mississippi
commenced
by
mr
jefferson
in
has
been
steadily
persevered
in
by
every
succeeding
president
and
may
be
considered
the
settled
policy
of
the
country
unconnected
at
first
with
any
welldefined
system
for
their
improvement
the
inducements
held
out
to
the
indians
were
confined
to
the
greater
abundance
of
game
to
be
found
in
the
west
but
when
the
beneficial
effects
of
their
removal
were
made
apparent
a
more
philanthropic
and
enlightened
policy
was
adopted
in
purchasing
their
lands
east
of
the
mississippi
liberal
prices
were
given
and
provisions
inserted
in
all
the
treaties
with
them
for
the
application
of
the
funds
they
received
in
exchange
to
such
purposes
as
were
best
calculated
to
promote
their
present
welfare
and
advance
their
future
civilization
these
measures
have
been
attended
thus
far
with
the
happiest
results
it
will
be
seen
by
referring
to
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
that
the
most
sanguine
expectations
of
the
friends
and
promoters
of
this
system
have
been
realized
the
choctaws
cherokees
and
other
tribes
that
first
emigrated
beyond
the
mississippi
have
for
the
most
part
abandoned
the
hunter
state
and
become
cultivators
of
the
soil
the
improvement
in
their
condition
has
been
rapid
and
it
is
believed
that
they
are
now
fitted
to
enjoy
the
advantages
of
a
simple
form
of
government
which
has
been
submitted
to
them
and
received
their
sanction
and
i
can
not
too
strongly
urge
this
subject
upon
the
attention
of
congress
stipulations
have
been
made
with
all
the
indian
tribes
to
remove
them
beyond
the
mississippi
except
with
the
bands
of
the
wyandots
the
six
nations
in
new
york
the
menomonees
munsees
and
stockbridges
in
wisconsin
and
miamies
in
indiana
with
all
but
the
menomonees
it
is
expected
that
arrangements
for
their
emigration
will
be
completed
the
present
year
the
resistance
which
has
been
opposed
to
their
removal
by
some
of
the
tribes
even
after
treaties
had
been
made
with
them
to
that
effect
has
arisen
from
various
causes
operating
differently
on
each
of
them
in
most
instances
they
have
been
instigated
to
resistance
by
persons
to
whom
the
trade
with
them
and
the
acquisition
of
their
annuities
were
important
and
in
some
by
the
personal
influence
of
interested
chiefs
these
obstacles
must
be
overcome
for
the
government
can
not
relinquish
the
execution
of
this
policy
without
sacrificing
important
interests
and
abandoning
the
tribes
remaining
east
of
the
mississippi
to
certain
destruction
the
decrease
in
numbers
of
the
tribes
within
the
limits
of
the
states
and
territories
has
been
most
rapid
if
they
be
removed
they
can
be
protected
from
those
associations
and
evil
practices
which
exert
so
pernicious
and
destructive
an
influence
over
their
destinies
they
can
be
induced
to
labor
and
to
acquire
property
and
its
acquisition
will
inspire
them
with
a
feeling
of
independence
their
minds
can
be
cultivated
and
they
can
be
taught
the
value
of
salutary
and
uniform
laws
and
be
made
sensible
of
the
blessings
of
free
government
and
capable
of
enjoying
its
advantages
in
the
possession
of
property
knowledge
and
a
good
government
free
to
give
what
direction
they
please
to
their
labor
and
sharers
in
the
legislation
by
which
their
persons
and
the
profits
of
their
industry
are
to
be
protected
and
secured
they
will
have
an
everpresent
conviction
of
the
importance
of
union
and
peace
among
themselves
and
of
the
preservation
of
amicable
relations
with
us
the
interests
of
the
united
states
would
also
be
greatly
promoted
by
freeing
the
relations
between
the
general
and
state
governments
from
what
has
proved
a
most
embarrassing
incumbrance
by
a
satisfactory
adjustment
of
conflicting
titles
to
lands
caused
by
the
occupation
of
the
indians
and
by
causing
the
resources
of
the
whole
country
to
be
developed
by
the
power
of
the
state
and
general
governments
and
improved
by
the
enterprise
of
a
white
population
intimately
connected
with
this
subject
is
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
fulfill
its
treaty
stipulations
and
to
protect
the
indians
thus
assembled
at
their
new
residences
from
all
interruptions
and
disturbances
from
any
other
tribes
or
nations
of
indians
or
from
any
other
person
or
persons
whatsoever
and
the
equally
solemn
obligation
to
guard
from
indian
hostility
its
own
border
settlements
stretching
along
a
line
of
more
than
miles
to
enable
the
government
to
redeem
this
pledge
to
the
indians
and
to
afford
adequate
protection
to
its
own
citizens
will
require
the
continual
presence
of
a
considerable
regular
force
on
the
frontiers
and
the
establishment
of
a
chain
of
permanent
posts
examinations
of
the
country
are
now
making
with
a
view
to
decide
on
the
most
suitable
points
for
the
erection
of
fortresses
and
other
works
of
defense
the
results
of
whi
ch
will
be
presented
to
you
by
the
secretary
of
war
at
an
early
day
together
with
a
plan
for
the
effectual
protection
of
the
friendly
indians
and
the
permanent
defense
of
the
frontier
states
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
herewith
communicated
it
appears
that
unremitted
exertions
have
been
made
at
the
different
navyyards
to
carry
into
effect
all
authorized
measures
for
the
extension
and
employment
of
our
naval
force
the
launching
and
preparation
of
the
ship
of
the
line
pennsylvania
and
the
complete
repairs
of
the
ships
of
the
line
ohio
delaware
and
columbus
may
be
noticed
as
forming
a
respectable
addition
to
this
important
arm
of
our
national
defense
our
commerce
and
navigation
have
received
increased
aid
and
protection
during
the
present
year
our
squadrons
in
the
pacific
and
on
the
brazilian
station
have
been
much
increased
and
that
in
the
mediterranean
although
small
is
adequate
to
the
present
wants
of
our
commerce
in
that
sea
additions
have
been
made
to
our
squadron
on
the
west
india
station
where
the
large
force
under
commodore
dallas
has
been
most
actively
and
efficiently
employed
in
protecting
our
commerce
in
preventing
the
importation
of
slaves
and
in
cooperating
with
the
officers
of
the
army
in
carrying
on
the
war
in
florida
the
satisfactory
condition
of
our
naval
force
abroad
leaves
at
our
disposal
the
means
of
conveniently
providing
for
a
home
squadron
for
the
protection
of
commerce
upon
our
extensive
coast
the
amount
of
appropriations
required
for
such
a
squadron
will
be
found
in
the
general
estimates
for
the
naval
service
for
the
year
the
naval
officers
engaged
upon
our
coast
survey
have
rendered
important
service
to
our
navigation
the
discovery
of
a
new
channel
into
the
harbor
of
new
york
through
which
our
largest
ships
may
pass
without
danger
must
afford
important
commercial
advantages
to
that
harbor
and
add
greatly
to
its
value
as
a
naval
station
the
accurate
survey
of
georges
shoals
off
the
coast
of
massachusetts
lately
completed
will
render
comparatively
safe
a
navigation
hitherto
considered
dangerous
considerable
additions
have
been
made
to
the
number
of
captains
commanders
lieutenants
surgeons
and
assistant
surgeons
in
the
navy
these
additions
were
rendered
necessary
by
the
increased
number
of
vessels
put
in
commission
to
answer
the
exigencies
of
our
growing
commerce
your
attention
is
respectfully
invited
to
the
various
suggestions
of
the
secretary
for
the
improvement
of
the
naval
service
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
exhibits
the
progress
and
condition
of
the
mail
service
the
operations
of
the
postoffice
department
constitute
one
of
the
most
active
elements
of
our
national
prosperity
and
it
is
gratifying
to
observe
with
what
vigor
they
are
conducted
the
mail
routes
of
the
united
states
cover
an
extent
of
about
miles
having
been
increased
about
miles
within
the
last
two
years
the
annual
mail
transportation
on
these
routes
is
about
miles
having
been
increased
about
miles
within
the
same
period
the
number
of
postoffices
has
also
been
increased
from
to
very
few
of
which
receive
the
mails
less
than
once
a
week
and
a
large
portion
of
them
daily
contractors
and
postmasters
in
general
are
represented
as
attending
to
their
duties
with
most
commendable
zeal
and
fidelity
the
revenue
of
the
department
within
the
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
last
was
and
its
liabilities
accruing
within
the
same
time
were
the
increase
of
revenue
over
that
of
the
preceding
year
was
for
many
interesting
details
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
with
the
accompanying
papers
your
particular
attention
is
invited
to
the
necessity
of
providing
a
more
safe
and
convenient
building
for
the
accommodation
of
that
department
i
lay
before
congress
copies
of
reports
submitted
in
pursuance
of
a
call
made
by
me
upon
the
heads
of
departments
for
such
suggestions
as
their
experience
might
enable
them
to
make
as
to
what
further
legislative
provisions
may
be
advantageously
adopted
to
secure
the
faithful
application
of
public
moneys
to
the
objects
for
which
they
are
appropriated
to
prevent
their
misapplication
or
embezzlement
by
those
intrusted
with
the
expenditure
of
them
and
generally
to
increase
the
security
of
the
government
against
losses
in
their
disbursement
it
is
needless
to
dilate
on
the
importance
of
providing
such
new
safeguards
as
are
within
the
power
of
legislation
to
promote
these
ends
and
i
have
little
to
add
to
the
recommendations
submitted
in
the
accompanying
papers
by
law
the
terms
of
service
of
our
most
important
collecting
and
disbursing
officers
in
the
civil
departments
are
limited
to
four
years
and
when
reappointed
their
bonds
are
required
to
be
renewed
the
safety
of
the
public
is
much
increased
by
this
feature
of
the
law
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
its
application
to
all
officers
intrusted
with
the
collection
or
disbursement
of
the
public
money
whatever
may
be
the
tenure
of
their
offices
would
be
equally
beneficial
i
therefore
recommend
in
addition
to
such
of
the
suggestions
presented
by
the
heads
of
departments
as
you
may
think
useful
a
general
provision
that
all
officers
of
the
army
or
navy
or
in
the
civil
departments
intrusted
with
the
receipt
or
payment
of
public
money
and
whose
term
of
service
is
either
unlimited
or
for
a
longer
time
than
four
years
be
required
to
give
new
bonds
with
good
and
sufficient
sureties
at
the
expiration
of
every
such
period
a
change
in
the
period
of
terminating
the
fiscal
year
from
the
st
of
october
to
the
st
of
april
has
been
frequently
recommended
and
appears
to
be
desirable
the
distressing
casualties
in
steamboats
which
have
so
frequently
happened
during
the
year
seem
to
evince
the
necessity
of
attempting
to
prevent
them
by
means
of
severe
provisions
connected
with
their
customhouse
papers
this
subject
was
submitted
to
the
attention
of
congress
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
last
annual
report
and
will
be
again
noticed
at
the
present
session
with
additional
details
it
will
doubtless
receive
that
early
and
careful
consideration
which
its
pressing
importance
appears
to
require
your
attention
has
heretofore
been
frequently
called
to
the
affairs
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
should
not
again
ask
it
did
not
their
entire
dependence
on
congress
give
them
a
constant
claim
upon
its
notice
separated
by
the
constitution
from
the
rest
of
the
union
limited
in
extent
and
aided
by
no
legislature
of
its
own
it
would
seem
to
be
a
spot
where
a
wise
and
uniform
system
of
local
government
might
have
been
easily
adopted
this
district
has
however
unfortunately
been
left
to
linger
behind
the
rest
of
the
union
its
codes
civil
and
criminal
are
not
only
very
defective
but
full
of
obsolete
or
inconvenient
provisions
being
formed
of
portions
of
two
states
discrepancies
in
the
laws
prevail
in
different
parts
of
the
territory
small
as
it
is
and
although
it
was
selected
as
the
seat
of
the
general
government
the
site
of
its
public
edifices
the
depository
of
its
archives
and
the
residence
of
officers
intrusted
with
large
amounts
of
public
property
and
the
management
of
public
business
yet
it
has
never
been
subjected
to
or
received
that
special
and
comprehensive
legislation
which
these
circumstances
peculiarly
demand
i
am
well
aware
of
the
various
subjects
of
greater
magnitude
and
immediate
interest
that
press
themselves
on
the
consideration
of
congress
but
i
believe
there
is
not
one
that
appeals
more
directly
to
its
justice
than
a
liberal
and
even
generous
attention
to
the
interests
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
a
thorough
and
careful
revision
of
its
local
government
m
van
buren

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
addressing
to
you
the
last
annual
message
i
shall
ever
present
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
it
is
a
source
of
the
most
heartfelt
satisfaction
to
be
able
to
congratulate
you
on
the
high
state
of
prosperity
which
our
beloved
country
has
attained
with
no
causes
at
home
or
abroad
to
lessen
the
confidence
with
which
we
look
to
the
future
for
continuing
proofs
of
the
capacity
of
our
free
institutions
to
produce
all
the
fruits
of
good
government
the
general
condition
of
our
affairs
may
well
excite
our
national
pride
i
can
not
avoid
congratulating
you
and
my
country
particularly
on
the
success
of
the
efforts
made
during
my
administration
by
the
executive
and
legislature
in
conformity
with
the
sincere
constant
and
earnest
desire
of
the
people
to
maintain
peace
and
establish
cordial
relations
with
all
foreign
powers
our
gratitude
is
due
to
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
and
i
invite
you
to
unite
with
me
in
offering
to
him
fervent
supplications
that
his
providential
care
may
ever
be
extended
to
those
who
follow
us
enabling
them
to
avoid
the
dangers
and
the
horrors
of
war
consistently
with
a
just
and
indispensable
regard
to
the
rights
and
honor
of
our
country
but
although
the
present
state
of
our
foreign
affairs
standing
without
important
change
as
they
did
when
you
separated
in
july
last
is
flattering
in
the
extreme
i
regret
to
say
that
many
questions
of
an
interesting
character
at
issue
with
other
powers
are
yet
unadjusted
amongst
the
most
prominent
of
these
is
that
of
our
north
east
boundary
with
an
undiminished
confidence
in
the
sincere
desire
of
his
britannic
majestys
government
to
adjust
that
question
i
am
not
yet
in
possession
of
the
precise
grounds
upon
which
it
proposes
a
satisfactory
adjustment
with
france
our
diplomatic
relations
have
been
resumed
and
under
circumstances
which
attest
the
disposition
of
both
governments
to
preserve
a
mutually
beneficial
intercourse
and
foster
those
amicable
feelings
which
are
so
strongly
required
by
the
true
interests
of
the
two
countries
with
russia
austria
prussia
naples
sweden
and
denmark
the
best
understanding
exists
and
our
commercial
intercourse
is
gradually
expanding
itself
with
them
it
is
encouraged
in
all
these
countries
except
naples
by
their
mutually
advantageous
and
liberal
treaty
stipulations
with
us
the
claims
of
our
citizens
on
portugal
are
admitted
to
be
just
but
provision
for
the
payment
of
them
has
been
unfortunately
delayed
by
frequent
political
changes
in
that
kingdom
the
blessings
of
peace
have
not
been
secured
by
spain
our
connections
with
that
country
are
on
the
best
footing
with
the
exception
of
the
burdens
still
imposed
upon
our
commerce
with
her
possessions
out
of
europe
the
claims
of
american
citizens
for
losses
sustained
at
the
bombardment
of
antwerp
have
been
presented
to
the
governments
of
holland
and
belgium
and
will
be
pressed
in
due
season
to
settlement
with
brazil
and
all
our
neighbors
of
this
continent
we
continue
to
maintain
relations
of
amity
and
concord
extending
our
commerce
with
them
as
far
as
the
resources
of
the
people
and
the
policy
of
their
governments
will
permit
the
just
and
longstanding
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
some
of
them
are
yet
sources
of
dissatisfaction
and
complaint
no
danger
is
apprehended
however
that
they
will
not
be
peacefully
although
tardily
acknowledged
and
paid
by
all
unless
the
irritating
effect
of
her
struggle
with
texas
should
unfortunately
make
our
immediate
neighbor
mexico
an
exception
it
is
already
known
to
you
by
the
correspondence
between
the
two
governments
communicated
at
your
last
session
that
our
conduct
in
relation
to
that
struggle
is
regulated
by
the
same
principles
that
governed
us
in
the
dispute
between
spain
and
mexico
herself
and
i
trust
that
it
will
be
found
on
the
most
severe
scrutiny
that
our
acts
have
strictly
corresponded
with
our
professions
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
should
feel
strong
prepossessions
for
the
one
party
is
not
surprising
but
this
circumstance
should
of
itself
teach
us
great
caution
lest
it
lead
us
into
the
great
error
of
suffering
public
policy
to
be
regulated
by
partially
or
prejudice
and
there
are
considerations
connected
with
the
possible
result
of
this
contest
between
the
two
parties
of
so
much
delicacy
and
importance
to
the
united
states
that
our
character
requires
that
we
should
neither
anticipate
events
nor
attempt
to
control
them
the
known
desire
of
the
texans
to
become
a
part
of
our
system
although
its
gratification
depends
upon
the
reconcilement
of
various
and
conflicting
interests
necessarily
a
work
of
time
and
uncertain
in
itself
is
calculated
to
expose
our
conduct
to
misconstruction
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
there
are
already
those
who
indifferent
to
principle
themselves
and
prone
to
suspect
the
want
of
it
in
others
charge
us
with
ambitious
designs
and
insidious
policy
you
will
perceive
by
the
accompanying
documents
that
the
extraordinary
mission
from
mexico
has
been
terminated
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
obligations
of
this
government
to
itself
and
to
mexico
under
treaty
stipulations
have
compelled
me
to
trust
a
discretionary
authority
to
a
high
officer
of
our
army
to
advance
into
territory
claimed
as
part
of
texas
if
necessary
to
protect
our
own
or
the
neighboring
frontier
from
indian
depredation
in
the
opinion
of
the
mexican
functionary
who
has
just
left
us
the
honor
of
his
country
will
be
wounded
by
american
soldiers
entering
with
the
most
amicable
avowed
purposes
upon
ground
from
which
the
followers
of
his
government
have
been
expelled
and
over
which
there
is
at
present
no
certainty
of
a
serious
effort
on
its
part
to
reestablish
its
dominion
the
departure
of
this
minister
was
the
more
singular
as
he
was
apprised
that
the
sufficiency
of
the
causes
assigned
for
the
advance
of
our
troops
by
the
commanding
general
had
been
seriously
doubted
by
me
and
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
that
the
troops
of
the
united
states
their
commander
having
had
time
to
ascertain
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
information
upon
which
they
had
been
marched
to
nacogdoches
would
be
either
there
in
perfect
accordance
with
the
principles
admitted
to
be
just
in
his
conference
with
the
secretary
of
state
by
the
mexican
minister
himself
or
were
already
withdrawn
in
consequence
of
the
impressive
warnings
their

it
is
hoped
and
believed
that
his
government
will
take
a
more
dispassionate
and
just
view
of
this
subject
and
not

disposed
to
construe
a

of
justifiable
precaution
made
necessary
by
its
known
inability
in
execution
of
the

to
act
upon

into
an
encroachment
upon

a

upon

in
the
mean
time
the
ancient
complaints
of
injustice
made
on

of
our
citizens
are
disregarded
and
new

of
dissatisfaction
have
arisen
some
of

character
requiring
prompt

and

acting
with
great
forbearance
upon

thus

that
no

what

the
prospect
of

being

it
is
proper
that
we

in
anticipation
prepared

to
perform
our

arriving

nothing
has
occurred
to
interrupt
the
good

that
has
long
existed
with
the
barbary

to
check
the
good

which
is
gradually
growing
up
from
our
intercourse
with
the

of
the

of
growing
of
the
distinguished

information
has
been
received
at
the
department
of

that
a
treaty
with
the
emperor
of
morocco
has
just
been
negotiated
which
i
hope
will
be
received
in
time
to
be
laid
before
the
senate
previous
to
the
close
of
the
session
you
will
perceive
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
the
financial
means
of
the
country
continue
to
keep
pace
with
its
improvement
in
all
other
respects
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
during
the
present
year
will
amount
to
about
those
from
customs
being
estimated
at
those
from
lands
at
about
and
the
residue
from
miscellaneous
sources
the
expenditures
for
all
objects
during
the
year
are
estimated
not
to
exceed
which
will
leave
a
balance
in
the
treasury
for
public
purposes
on
the
first
day
of
january
next
of
about
this
sum
with
the
exception
of
will
be
transferred
to
the
several
states
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
regulating
the
deposits
of
the
public
money
the
unexpended
balances
of
appropriation
on
the
first
day
of
january
next
are
estimated
at
exceeding
by
the
amount
which
will
be
left
in
the
deposit
banks
subject
to
the
draft
of
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
after
the
contemplated
transfers
to
the
several
states
are
made
if
therefore
the
future
receipts
should
not
be
sufficient
to
meet
these
outstanding
and
future
appropriations
there
may
be
soon
a
necessity
to
use
a
portion
of
the
funds
deposited
with
the
states
the
consequences
apprehended
when
the
deposit
act
of
the
last
session
received
a
reluctant
approval
hav
e
been
measurably
realized
though
an
act
merely
for
the
deposit
of
the
surplus
moneys
of
the
united
states
in
the
state
treasuries
for
safekeeping
until
they
may
be
wanted
for
the
service
of
the
general
government
it
has
been
extensively
spoken
of
as
an
act
to
give
the
money
to
the
several
states
and
they
have
been
advised
to
use
it
as
a
gift
without
regard
to
the
means
of
refunding
it
when
called
for
such
a
suggestion
has
doubtless
been
made
without
a
proper
attention
to
the
various
principles
and
interests
which
are
affected
by
it
it
is
manifest
that
the
law
itself
can
not
sanction
such
a
suggestion
and
that
as
it
now
stands
the
states
have
no
more
authority
to
receive
and
use
these
deposits
without
intending
to
return
them
than
any
deposit
bank
or
any
individual
temporarily
charged
with
the
safekeeping
or
application
of
the
public
money
would
now
have
for
converting
the
same
to
their
private
use
without
the
consent
and
against
the
will
of
the
government
but
independently
of
the
violation
of
public
faith
and
moral
obligation
which
are
involved
in
this
suggestion
when
examined
in
reference
to
the
terms
of
the
present
deposit
act
it
is
believed
that
the
considerations
which
should
govern
the
future
legislation
of
congress
on
this
subject
will
be
equally
conclusive
against
the
adoption
of
any
measure
recognizing
the
principles
on
which
the
suggestion
has
been
made
considering
the
intimate
connection
of
the
subject
with
the
financial
interests
of
the
country
and
its
great
importance
in
whatever
aspect
it
can
be
viewed
i
have
bestowed
upon
it
the
most
anxious
reflection
and
feel
it
to
be
my
duty
to
state
to
congress
such
thoughts
as
have
occurred
to
me
to
aid
their
deliberation
in
treating
it
in
the
manner
best
calculated
to
conduce
to
the
common
good
the
experience
of
other
nations
admonished
us
to
hasten
the
extinguishment
of
the
public
debt
but
it
will
be
in
vain
that
we
have
congratulated
each
other
upon
the
disappearance
of
this
evil
if
we
do
not
guard
against
the
equally
great
one
of
promoting
the
unnecessary
accumulation
of
public
revenue
no
political
maxim
is
better
established
than
that
which
tells
us
that
an
improvident
expenditure
of
money
is
the
parent
of
profligacy
and
that
no
people
can
hope
to
perpetuate
their
liberties
who
long
acquiesce
in
a
policy
which
taxes
them
for
objects
not
necessary
to
the
legitimate
and
real
wants
of
their
government
flattering
as
is
the
condition
of
our
country
at
the
present
period
because
of
its
unexampled
advance
in
all
the
steps
of
social
and
political
improvement
it
can
not
be
disguised
that
there
is
a
lurking
danger
already
apparent
in
the
neglect
of
this
warning
truth
and
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
the
representatives
of
the
people
should
be
employed
in
devising
some
more
appropriate
remedy
than
now
exists
to
avert
it
under
our
present
revenue
system
there
is
every
probability
that
there
will
continue
to
be
a
surplus
beyond
the
wants
of
the
government
and
it
has
become
our
duty
to
decide
whether
such
a
result
be
consistent
with
the
true
objects
of
our
government
should
a
surplus
be
permitted
to
accumulate
beyond
the
appropriations
it
must
be
retained
in
the
treasury
as
it
now
is
or
distributed
among
the
people
or
the
states
to
retain
it
in
the
treasury
unemployed
in
any
way
is
impracticable
it
is
besides
against
the
genius
of
our
free
institutions
to
lock
up
in
vaults
the
treasure
of
the
nation
to
take
from
the
people
the
right
of
bearing
arms
and
put
their
weapons
of
defense
in
the
hands
of
a
standing
army
would
be
scarcely
more
dangerous
to
their
liberties
than
to
permit
the
government
to
accumulate
immense
amounts
of
treasure
beyond
the
supplies
necessary
to
its
legitimate
wants
such
a
treasure
would
doubtless
be
employed
at
some
time
as
it
has
been
in
other
countries
when
opportunity
tempted
ambition
to
collect
it
merely
for
distribution
to
the
states
would
seem
to
be
highly
impolitic
if
not
as
dangerous
as
the
proposition
to
retain
it
in
the
treasury
the
shortest
reflection
must
satisfy
everyone
that
to
require
the
people
to
pay
taxes
to
the
government
merely
that
they
may
be
paid
back
again
is
sporting
with
the
substantial
interests
of
the
country
and
no
system
which
produces
such
a
result
can
be
expected
to
receive
the
public
countenance
nothing
could
be
gained
by
it
even
if
each
individual
who
contributed
a
portion
of
the
tax
could
receive
back
promptly
the
same
portion
but
it
is
apparent
that
no
system
of
the
kind
can
ever
be
enforced
which
will
not
absorb
a
considerable
portion
of
the
money
to
be
distributed
in
salaries
and
commissions
to
the
agents
employed
in
the
process
and
in
the
various
losses
and
depreciations
which
arise
from
other
causes
and
the
practical
effect
of
such
an
attempt
must
ever
be
to
burden
the
people
with
taxes
not
for
purposes
beneficial
to
them
but
to
swell
the
profits
of
deposit
banks
and
support
a
band
of
useless
public
officers
a
distribution
to
the
people
is
impracticable
and
unjust
in
other
respects
it
would
be
taking
one
mans
property
and
giving
it
to
another
such
would
be
the
unavoidable
result
of
a
rule
of
equality
and
none
other
is
spoken
of
or
would
be
likely
to
be
adopted
in
as
much
as
there
is
no
mode
by
which
the
amount
of
the
individual
contributions
of
our
citizens
to
the
public
revenue
can
be
ascertained
we
know
that
they
contribute
unequally
and
a
rule
therefore
that
would
distribute
to
them
equally
would
be
liable
to
all
the
objections
which
apply
to
the
principle
of
an
equal
division
of
property
to
make
the
general
government
the
instrument
of
carrying
this
odious
principle
into
effect
would
be
at
once
to
destroy
the
means
of
its
usefulness
and
change
the
character
designed
for
it
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
but
the
more
extended
and
injurious
consequences
likely
to
result
from
a
policy
which
would
collect
a
surplus
revenue
from
the
purpose
of
distributing
it
may
be
forcibly
illustrated
by
an
examination
of
the
effects
already
produced
by
the
present
deposit
act
this
act
although
certainly
designed
to
secure
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
revenue
is
not
entirely
free
in
its
tendencies
from
any
of
the
objections
which
apply
to
this
principle
of
distribution
the
government
had
without
necessity
received
from
the
people
a
large
surplus
which
instead
of
being
employed
as
heretofore
and
returned
to
them
by
means
of
the
public
expenditure
was
deposited
with
sundry
banks
the
banks
proceeded
to
make
loans
upon
this
surplus
and
thus
converted
it
into
banking
capital
and
in
this
manner
it
has
tended
to
multiply
bank
charters
and
has
had
a
great
agency
in
producing
a
spirit
of
wild
speculation
the
possession
and
use
of
the
property
out
of
which
this
surplus
was
created
belonged
to
the
people
but
the
government
has
transferred
its
possession
to
incorporated
banks
whose
interest
and
effort
it
is
to
make
large
profits
out
of
its
use
this
process
need
only
be
stated
to
show
its
injustice
and
bad
policy
and
the
same
observations
apply
to
the
influence
which
is
produced
by
the
steps
necessary
to
collect
as
well
as
to
distribute
such
a
revenue
about
of
all
the
duties
on
imports
are
paid
in
the
city
of
new
york
but
it
is
obvious
that
the
means
to
pay
those
duties
are
drawn
from
every
quarter
of
the
union
every
citizen
in
every
state
who
purchases
and
consumes
an
article
which
has
paid
a
duty
at
that
port
contributes
to
the
accumulating
mass
the
surplus
collected
there
must
therefore
be
made
up
of
moneys
or
property
withdrawn
from
other
points
and
other
states
thus
the
wealth
and
business
of
every
region
from
which
these
surplus
funds
proceed
must
be
to
some
extent
injured
while
that
of
the
place
where
the
funds
are
concentrated
and
are
employed
in
banking
are
proportionably
extended
but
both
in
making
the
transfer
of
the
funds
which
are
first
necessary
to
pay
the
duties
and
collect
the
surplus
and
in
making
the
retransfer
which
becomes
necessary
when
the
time
arrives
for
the
distribution
of
that
surplus
there
is
a
considerable
period
when
the
funds
can
not
be
brought
into
use
and
it
is
manifest
that
besides
the
loss
inevitable
from
such
an
operation
its
tendency
is
to
produce
fluctuations
in
the
business
of
the
country
which
are
always
productive
of
speculation
and
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
regular
trade
argument
can
scarcely
be
necessary
to
show
that
a
measure
of
this
character
ought
not
to
receive
further
legislative
encouragement
by
examining
the
practical
operation
of
the
ration
for
distribution
adopted
in
the
deposit
bill
of
the
last
session
we
shall
discover
other
features
that
appear
equally
objectionable
let
it
be
assumed
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
surplus
moneys
to
be
deposited
with
the
states
have
been
collected
and
belong
to
them
in
the
ration
of
their
federal
representative
populationan
assumption
founded
upon
the
fact
that
any
deficiencies
in
our
future
revenue
from
imposts
and
public
lands
must
be
made
up
by
direct
taxes
collected
from
the
states
in
that
ration
it
is
proposed
to
distribute
this
surplussay
not
according
to
the
ration
in
which
it
has
been
collected
and
belongs
to
the
people
of
the
states
but
in
that
of
their
votes
in
the
colleges
of
electors
of
president
and
vice
president
the
effect
of
a
distribution
upon
that
ration
is
shown
by
the
annexed
table
marked
a
by
an
examination
of
that
table
it
will
be
perceived
that
in
the
distribution
of
a
surplus
of
upon
that
basis
there
is
a
great
departure
from
the
principle
which
regards
representation
as
the
true
measure
of
taxation
and
it
will
be
found
that
the
tendency
of
that
departure
will
be
to
increase
whatever
inequalities
have
been
supposed
to
attend
the
operation
of
our
federal
system
in
respect
to
its
bearings
upon
the
different
interests
of
the
union
in
making
the
basis
of
representation
the
basis
of
taxation
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
to
equalize
the
burdens
which
are
necessary
to
support
the
government
and
the
adoption
of
that
ratio
while
it
accomplished
this
object
was
also
the
means
of
adjusting
other
great
topi
cs
arising
out
of
the
conflicting
views
respecting
the
political
equality
of
the
various
members
of
the
confederacy
what
ever
therefore
disturbs
the
liberal
spirit
of
the
compromises
which
established
a
rule
of
taxation
so
just
and
equitable
and
which
experience
has
proved
to
be
so
well
adapted
to
the
genius
and
habits
of
our
people
should
be
received
with
the
greatest
caution
and
distrust
a
bare
inspection
in
the
annexed
table
of
the
differences
produced
by
the
ration
used
in
the
deposit
act
compared
with
the
results
of
a
distribution
according
to
the
ration
of
direct
taxation
must
satisfy
every
unprejudiced
mind
that
the
former
ration
contravenes
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
produces
a
degree
of
injustice
in
the
operations
of
the
federal
government
which
would
be
fatal
to
the
hope
of
perpetuating
it
by
the
ration
of
direct
taxation
for
example
the
state
of
delaware
in
the
collection
of
of
revenue
would
pay
into
the
treasury
and
in
a
distribution
of
she
would
receive
back
from
the
government
according
to
the
ration
of
the
deposit
bill
the
sum
of
and
similar
results
would
follow
the
comparison
between
the
small
and
the
large
states
throughout
the
union
thus
realizing
to
the
small
states
an
advantage
which
would
be
doubtless
as
unacceptable
to
them
as
a
motive
for
incorporating
the
principle
in
any
system
which
would
produce
it
as
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
rights
and
expectations
of
the
large
states
it
was
certainly
the
intention
of
that
provision
of
the
constitution
which
declares
that
all
duties
imposts
and
excises
shall
be
uniform
throughout
the
united
states
to
make
the
burdens
of
taxation
fall
equally
upon
the
people
in
what
ever
state
of
the
union
they
may
reside
but
what
would
be
the
value
of
such
a
uniform
rule
if
the
moneys
raised
by
it
could
be
immediately
returned
by
a
different
one
which
will
give
to
the
people
of
some
states
much
more
and
to
those
of
others
much
less
than
their
fair
proportions
were
the
federal
government
to
exempt
in
express
terms
the
imports
products
and
manufactures
of
some
portions
of
the
country
from
all
duties
while
it
imposed
heavy
ones
on
others
the
injustice
could
not
be
greater
it
would
be
easy
to
show
how
by
the
operation
of
such
a
principle
the
large
states
of
the
union
would
not
only
have
to
contribute
their
just
share
toward
the
support
of
the
federal
government
but
also
have
to
bear
in
some
degree
the
taxes
necessary
to
support
the
governments
of
their
smaller
sisters
but
it
is
deemed
unnecessary
to
state
the
details
where
the
general
principle
is
so
obvious
a
system
liable
to
such
objections
can
never
be
supposed
to
have
been
sanctioned
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
when
they
conferred
on
congress
the
taxing
power
and
i
feel
persuaded
that
a
mature
examination
of
the
subject
will
satisfy
everyone
that
there
are
insurmountable
difficulties
in
the
operation
of
any
plan
which
can
be
devised
of
collecting
revenue
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
it
congress
is
only
authorized
to
levy
taxes
to
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defense
and
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
there
is
no
such
provision
as
would
authorize
congress
to
collect
together
the
property
of
the
country
under
the
name
of
revenue
for
the
purpose
of
dividing
it
equally
or
unequally
among
the
states
or
the
people
indeed
it
is
not
probable
that
such
an
idea
ever
occurred
to
the
states
when
they
adopted
the
constitution
but
however
this
may
be
the
only
safe
rule
for
us
in
interpreting
the
powers
granted
to
the
federal
government
is
to
regard
the
absence
of
express
authority
to
touch
a
subject
so
important
and
delicate
as
this
as
equivalent
to
a
prohibition
even
if
our
powers
were
less
doubtful
in
this
respect
as
the
constitution
now
stands
there
are
considerations
afforded
by
recent
experience
which
would
seem
to
make
it
our
duty
to
avoid
a
resort
to
such
a
system
all
will
admit
that
the
simplicity
and
economy
of
the
state
governments
mainly
depend
on
the
fact
that
money
has
to
be
supplied
to
support
them
by
the
same
men
or
their
agents
who
vote
it
away
in
appropriations
hence
when
there
are
extravagant
and
wasteful
appropriations
there
must
be
a
corresponding
increase
of
taxes
and
the
people
becoming
awakened
will
necessarily
scrutinize
the
character
of
measures
which
thus
increase
their
burdens
by
the
watchful
eye
of
selfinterest
the
agents
of
the
people
in
the
state
governments
are
repressed
and
kept
within
the
limits
of
a
just
economy
but
if
the
necessity
of
levying
the
taxes
be
taken
from
those
who
make
the
appropriations
and
thrown
upon
a
more
distant
and
less
responsible
set
of
public
agents
who
have
power
to
approach
the
people
by
an
indirect
and
stealthy
taxation
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
prodigality
will
soon
supersede
those
characteristics
which
have
thus
far
made
us
look
with
so
much
pride
and
confidence
to
the
state
governments
as
the
mainstay
of
our
union
and
liberties
the
state
legislatures
instead
of
studying
to
restrict
their
state
expenditures
to
the
smallest
possible
sum
will
claim
credit
for
their
profusion
and
harass
the
general
government
for
increased
supplies
practically
there
would
soon
be
but
one
taxing
power
and
that
vested
in
a
body
of
men
far
removed
from
the
people
in
which
the
farming
and
mechanic
interests
would
scarcely
be
represented
the
states
would
gradually
lose
their
purity
as
well
as
their
independence
they
would
not
dare
to
murmur
at
the
proceedings
of
the
general
government
lest
they
should
lose
their
supplies
all
would
be
merged
in
a
practical
consolidation
cemented
by
widespread
corruption
which
could
only
be
eradicated
by
one
of
those
bloody
revolutions
which
occasionally
overthrow
the
despotic
systems
of
the
old
world
in
all
the
other
aspects
in
which
i
have
been
able
to
look
at
the
effect
of
such
a
principle
of
distribution
upon
the
best
interests
of
the
country
i
can
see
nothing
to
compensate
for
the
disadvantages
to
which
i
have
adverted
if
we
consider
the
protective
duties
which
are
in
a
great
degree
the
source
of
the
surplus
revenue
beneficial
to
one
section
of
the
union
and
prejudicial
to
another
there
is
no
corrective
for
the
evil
in
such
a
plan
of
distribution
on
the
contrary
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
all
the
complaints
which
have
sprung
from
this
cause
would
be
aggravated
everyone
must
be
sensible
that
a
distribution
of
the
surplus
must
beget
a
disposition
to
cherish
the
means
which
create
it
and
any
system
therefore
into
which
it
enters
must
have
a
powerful
tendency
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
the
tariff
if
it
were
even
admitted
that
the
advantages
of
such
a
system
could
be
made
equal
to
all
the
sections
of
the
union
the
reasons
already
so
urgently
calling
for
a
reduction
of
the
revenue
would
never
the
less
lose
none
of
their
force
for
it
will
always
be
improbable
that
an
intelligent
and
virtuous
community
can
consent
to
raise
a
surplus
for
the
mere
purpose
of
dividing
it
diminished
as
it
must
inevitably
be
by
the
expenses
of
the
various
machinery
necessary
to
the
process
the
safest
and
simplest
mode
of
obviating
all
the
difficulties
which
have
been
mentioned
is
to
collect
only
revenue
enough
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
government
and
let
the
people
keep
the
balance
of
their
property
in
their
own
hands
to
be
used
for
their
own
profit
each
state
will
then
support
its
own
government
and
contribute
its
due
share
toward
the
support
of
the
general
government
there
would
be
no
surplus
to
cramp
and
lessen
the
resources
of
individual
wealth
and
enterprise
and
the
banks
would
be
left
to
their
ordinary
means
whatever
agitations
and
fluctuations
might
arise
from
our
unfortunate
paper
system
they
could
never
be
attributed
justly
or
unjustly
to
the
action
of
the
federal
government
there
would
be
some
guaranty
that
the
spirit
of
wild
speculation
which
seeks
to
convert
the
surplus
revenue
into
banking
capital
would
be
effectually
checked
and
that
the
scenes
of
demoralization
which
are
now
so
prevalent
through
the
land
would
disappear
without
desiring
to
conceal
that
the
experience
and
observation
of
the
last
two
years
have
operated
a
partial
change
in
my
views
upon
this
interesting
subject
it
is
never
the
less
regretted
that
the
suggestions
made
by
me
in
my
annual
messages
of
and
have
been
greatly
misunderstood
at
that
time
the
great
struggle
was
begun
against
that
latitudinarian
construction
of
the
constitution
which
authorizes
the
unlimited
appropriation
of
the
revenues
of
the
union
to
internal
improvements
within
the
states
tending
to
invest
in
the
hands
and
place
under
the
control
of
the
general
government
all
the
principal
roads
and
canals
of
the
country
in
violation
of
state
rights
and
in
derogation
of
state
authority
at
the
same
time
the
condition
of
the
manufacturing
interest
was
such
as
to
create
an
apprehension
that
the
duties
on
imports
could
not
without
extensive
mischief
be
reduced
in
season
to
prevent
the
accumulation
of
a
considerable
surplus
after
the
payment
of
the
national
debt
in
view
of
the
dangers
of
such
a
surplus
and
in
preference
to
its
application
to
internal
improvements
in
derogation
of
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
states
the
suggestion
of
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
to
authorize
its
distribution
was
made
it
was
an
alternative
for
what
were
deemed
greater
evilsa
temporary
resort
to
relieve
an
overburdened
treasury
until
the
government
could
without
a
sudden
and
destructive
revulsion
in
the
business
of
the
country
gradually
return
to
the
just
principle
of
raising
no
more
revenue
from
the
people
in
taxes
than
is
necessary
for
its
economical
support
even
that
alternative
was
not
spoken
of
but
in
connection
with
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
no
temporary
inconvenience
can
justify
the
exercise
of
a
prohibited
power
not
granted
by
that
instrument
and
it
was
from
a
conviction
that
the
power
to
distribute
even
a
temporary
surplus
of
revenue
is
of
that
character
that
it
was
suggested
only
in
connection
with
an
appeal
to
the
source
of
all
legal
power
in
the
general
government
the
states
which
have
establi
shed
it
no
such
appeal
has
been
taken
and
in
my
opinion
a
distribution
of
the
surplus
revenue
by
congress
either
to
the
states
or
the
people
is
to
be
considered
as
among
the
prohibitions
of
the
constitution
as
already
intimated
my
views
have
undergone
a
change
so
far
as
to
be
convinced
that
no
alteration
of
the
constitution
in
this
respect
is
wise
or
expedient
the
influence
of
an
accumulating
surplus
upon
the
credit
system
of
the
country
producing
dangerous
extensions
and
ruinous
contractions
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
property
rash
speculation
idleness
extravagance
and
a
deterioration
of
morals
have
taught
us
the
important
lesson
that
any
transient
mischief
which
may
attend
the
reduction
of
our
revenue
to
the
wants
of
our
government
is
to
be
borne
in
preference
to
an
overflowing
treasury
i
beg
leave
to
call
your
attention
to
another
subject
intimately
associated
with
the
preceding
onethe
currency
of
the
country
it
is
apparent
from
the
whole
context
of
the
constitution
as
well
as
the
history
of
the
times
which
gave
birth
to
it
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
convention
to
establish
a
currency
consisting
of
the
precious
metals
these
from
their
peculiar
properties
which
rendered
them
the
standard
of
value
in
all
other
countries
were
adopted
in
this
as
well
to
establish
its
commercial
standard
in
reference
to
foreign
countries
by
a
permanent
rule
as
to
exclude
the
use
of
a
mutable
medium
of
exchange
such
as
of
certain
agricultural
commodities
recognized
by
the
statutes
of
some
states
as
a
tender
for
debts
or
the
still
more
pernicious
expedient
of
a
paper
currency
the
last
from
the
experience
of
the
evils
of
the
issues
of
paper
during
the
revolution
had
become
so
justly
obnoxious
as
not
only
to
suggest
the
clause
in
the
constitution
forbidding
the
emission
of
bills
of
credit
by
the
states
but
also
to
produce
that
vote
in
the
convention
which
negatived
the
proposition
to
grant
power
to
congress
to
charter
corporationsa
proposition
well
understood
at
the
time
as
intended
to
authorize
the
establishment
of
a
national
bank
which
was
to
issue
a
currency
of
bank
notes
on
a
capital
to
be
created
to
some
extent
out
of
government
stocks
although
this
proposition
was
refused
by
a
direct
vote
of
the
convention
the
object
was
afterwards
in
effect
obtained
by
its
ingenious
advocates
through
a
strained
construction
of
the
constitution
the
debts
of
the
revolution
were
funded
at
prices
which
formed
no
equivalent
compared
with
the
nominal
amount
of
the
stock
and
under
circumstances
which
exposed
the
motives
of
some
of
those
who
participated
in
the
passage
of
the
act
to
distrust
the
facts
that
the
value
of
the
stock
was
greatly
enhanced
by
the
creation
of
the
bank
that
it
was
well
understood
that
such
would
be
the
case
and
that
some
of
the
advocates
of
the
measure
were
largely
benefited
by
it
belong
to
the
history
of
the
times
and
are
well
calculated
to
diminish
the
respect
which
might
otherwise
have
been
due
to
the
action
of
the
congress
which
created
the
institution
on
the
establishment
of
a
national
bank
it
became
the
interest
of
its
creditors
that
gold
should
be
superseded
by
the
paper
of
the
bank
as
a
general
currency
a
value
was
soon
attached
to
the
gold
coins
which
made
their
exportation
to
foreign
countries
as
a
mercantile
commodity
more
profitable
than
their
retention
and
use
at
home
as
money
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
if
not
designed
by
those
who
established
the
bank
that
the
bank
became
in
effect
a
substitute
for
the
mint
of
the
united
states
such
was
the
origin
of
a
national
bank
currency
and
such
the
beginning
of
those
difficulties
which
now
appear
in
the
excessive
issues
of
the
banks
incorporated
by
the
various
states
although
it
may
not
be
possible
by
any
legislative
means
within
our
power
to
change
at
once
the
system
which
has
thus
been
introduced
and
has
received
the
acquiescence
of
all
portions
of
the
country
it
is
certainly
our
duty
to
do
all
that
is
consistent
with
our
constitutional
obligations
in
preventing
the
mischiefs
which
are
threatened
by
its
undue
extension
that
the
efforts
of
the
fathers
of
our
government
to
guard
against
it
by
a
constitutional
provision
were
founded
on
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
subject
has
been
frequently
attested
by
the
bitter
experience
of
the
country
the
same
causes
which
led
them
to
refuse
their
sanction
to
a
power
authorizing
the
establishment
of
incorporations
for
banking
purposes
now
exist
in
a
much
stronger
degree
to
urge
us
to
exert
the
utmost
vigilance
in
calling
into
action
the
means
necessary
to
correct
the
evils
resulting
from
the
unfortunate
exercise
of
the
power
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
opportunity
for
effecting
this
great
good
will
be
improved
before
the
country
witnesses
new
scenes
of
embarrassment
and
distress
variableness
must
ever
be
the
characteristic
of
a
currency
of
which
the
precious
metals
are
not
the
chief
ingredient
or
which
can
be
expanded
or
contracted
without
regard
to
the
principles
that
regulate
the
value
of
those
metals
as
a
standard
in
the
general
trade
of
the
world
with
us
bank
issues
constitute
such
a
currency
and
must
ever
do
so
until
they
are
made
dependent
on
those
just
proportions
of
gold
and
silver
as
a
circulating
medium
which
experience
has
proved
to
be
necessary
not
only
in
this
but
in
all
other
commercial
countries
where
those
proportions
are
not
infused
into
the
circulation
and
do
not
control
it
it
is
manifest
that
prices
must
vary
according
to
the
tide
of
bank
issues
and
the
value
and
stability
of
property
must
stand
exposed
to
all
the
uncertainty
which
attends
the
administration
of
institutions
that
are
constantly
liable
to
the
temptation
of
an
interest
distinct
from
that
of
the
community
in
which
they
are
established
the
progress
of
an
expansion
or
rather
a
depreciation
of
the
currency
by
excessive
bank
issues
is
always
attended
by
a
loss
to
the
laboring
classes
this
portion
of
the
community
have
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
watch
the
ebbs
and
flows
of
the
money
market
engaged
from
day
to
day
in
their
useful
toils
they
do
not
perceive
that
although
their
wages
are
nominally
the
same
or
even
somewhat
higher
they
are
greatly
reduced
in
fact
by
the
rapid
increase
of
a
spurious
currency
which
as
it
appears
to
make
money
abound
they
are
at
first
inclined
to
consider
a
blessing
it
is
not
so
with
the
speculator
by
whom
this
operation
is
better
understood
and
is
made
to
contribute
to
his
advantage
it
is
not
until
the
prices
of
the
necessaries
of
life
become
so
dear
that
the
laboring
classes
can
not
supply
their
wants
out
of
their
wages
that
the
wages
rise
and
gradually
reach
a
justly
proportioned
rate
to
that
of
the
products
of
their
labor
when
thus
by
depreciation
in
consequence
of
the
quantity
of
paper
in
circulation
wages
as
well
as
prices
become
exorbitant
it
is
soon
found
that
the
whole
effect
of
the
adulteration
is
a
tariff
on
our
home
industry
for
the
benefit
of
the
countries
where
gold
and
silver
circulate
and
maintain
uniformity
and
moderation
in
prices
it
is
then
perceived
that
the
enhancement
of
the
price
of
land
and
labor
produces
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
price
of
products
until
these
products
do
not
sustain
a
competition
with
similar
ones
in
other
countries
and
thus
both
manufactured
and
agricultural
productions
cease
to
bear
expectation
from
the
country
of
the
spurious
currency
because
they
can
not
be
sold
for
cost
this
is
the
process
by
which
specie
is
banished
by
the
paper
of
the
banks
their
vaults
are
soon
exhausted
to
pay
for
foreign
commodities
the
next
step
is
a
stoppage
of
specie
paymenta
total
degradation
of
paper
as
a
currencyunusual
depression
of
prices
the
ruin
of
debtors
and
the
accumulation
of
property
in
the
hands
of
creditors
and
cautious
capitalists
it
was
in
view
of
these
evils
together
with
the
dangerous
power
wielded
by
the
bank
of
the
united
states
and
its
repugnance
to
our
constitution
that
i
was
induced
to
exert
the
power
conferred
upon
me
by
the
american
people
to
prevent
the
continuance
of
that
institution
but
although
various
dangers
to
our
republican
institutions
have
been
obviated
by
the
failure
of
that
bank
to
extort
from
the
government
a
renewal
of
its
charter
it
is
obvious
that
little
has
been
accomplished
except
a
salutary
change
of
public
opinion
toward
restoring
to
the
country
the
sound
currency
provided
for
in
the
constitution
in
the
acts
of
several
of
the
states
prohibiting
the
circulation
of
small
notes
and
the
auxiliary
enactments
of
congress
at
the
last
session
forbidding
their
reception
or
payment
on
public
account
the
true
policy
of
the
country
has
been
advanced
and
a
larger
portion
of
the
precious
metals
infused
into
our
circulating
medium
these
measures
will
probably
be
followed
up
in
due
time
by
the
enactment
of
state
laws
banishing
from
circulation
bank
notes
of
still
higher
denominations
and
the
object
may
be
materially
promoted
by
further
acts
of
congress
forbidding
the
employment
as
fiscal
agents
of
such
banks
as
continue
to
issue
notes
of
low
denominations
and
throw
impediments
in
the
way
of
the
circulation
of
gold
and
silver
the
effects
of
an
extension
of
bank
credits
and
overissues
of
bank
paper
have
been
strikingly
illustrated
in
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
from
the
returns
made
by
the
various
registers
and
receivers
in
the
early
part
of
last
summer
it
was
perceived
that
the
receipts
arising
from
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
were
increasing
to
an
unprecedented
amount
in
effect
however
these
receipts
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
credits
in
bank
the
banks
lent
out
their
notes
to
speculators
they
were
paid
to
the
receivers
and
immediately
returned
to
the
banks
to
be
lent
out
again
and
again
being
mere
instruments
to
transfer
to
speculators
the
most
valuable
public
land
and
pay
the
government
by
a
credit
on
the
books
of
the
banks
those
credits
on
the
books
of
some
of
the
western
banks
usually
called
deposits
were
already
greatly
beyond
their
immediate
means
of
payment
and
were
rapidly
increasing
indeed
each
speculation
furnished
means
for
another
for
no
soone
r
had
one
individual
or
company
paid
in
the
notes
than
they
were
immediately
lent
to
another
for
a
like
purpose
and
the
banks
were
extending
their
business
and
their
issues
so
largely
as
to
alarm
considerate
men
and
render
it
doubtful
whether
these
bank
credits
if
permitted
to
accumulate
would
ultimately
be
of
the
least
value
to
the
government
the
spirit
of
expansion
and
speculation
was
not
confined
to
the
deposit
banks
but
pervaded
the
whole
multitude
of
banks
throughout
the
union
and
was
giving
rise
to
new
institutions
to
aggravate
the
evil
the
safety
of
the
public
funds
and
the
interest
of
the
people
generally
required
that
these
operations
should
be
checked
and
it
became
the
duty
of
every
branch
of
the
general
and
state
governments
to
adopt
all
legitimate
and
proper
means
to
produce
that
salutary
effect
under
this
view
of
my
duty
i
directed
the
issuing
of
the
order
which
will
be
laid
before
you
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
requiring
payment
for
the
public
lands
sold
to
be
made
in
specie
with
an
exception
until
the
th
of
the
present
month
in
favor
of
actual
settlers
this
measure
has
produced
many
salutary
consequences
it
checked
the
career
of
the
western
banks
and
gave
them
additional
strength
in
anticipation
of
the
pressure
which
has
since
pervaded
our
eastern
as
well
as
the
european
commercial
cities
by
preventing
the
extension
of
the
credit
system
it
measurably
cut
off
the
means
of
speculation
and
retarded
its
progress
in
monopolizing
the
most
valuable
of
the
public
lands
it
has
tended
to
save
the
new
states
from
a
nonresident
proprietorship
one
of
the
greatest
obstacles
to
the
advancement
of
a
new
country
and
the
prosperity
of
an
old
one
it
has
tended
to
keep
open
the
public
lands
for
entry
by
emigrants
at
government
prices
instead
of
their
being
compelled
to
purchase
of
speculators
at
double
or
triple
prices
and
it
is
conveying
into
the
interior
large
sums
in
silver
and
gold
there
to
enter
permanently
into
the
currency
of
the
country
and
place
it
on
a
firmer
foundation
it
is
confidently
believed
that
the
country
will
find
in
the
motives
which
induced
that
order
and
the
happy
consequences
which
will
have
ensued
much
to
commend
and
nothing
to
condemn
it
remains
for
congress
if
they
approve
the
policy
which
dictated
this
order
to
follow
it
up
in
its
various
bearings
much
good
in
my
judgment
would
be
produced
by
prohibiting
sales
of
the
public
lands
except
to
actual
settlers
at
a
reasonable
reduction
of
price
and
to
limit
the
quantity
which
shall
be
sold
to
them
although
it
is
believed
the
general
government
never
ought
to
receive
anything
but
the
constitutional
currency
in
exchange
for
the
public
lands
that
point
would
be
of
less
importance
if
the
lands
were
sold
for
immediate
settlement
and
cultivation
indeed
there
is
scarcely
a
mischief
arising
out
of
our
present
land
system
including
the
accumulating
surplus
of
revenues
which
would
not
be
remedied
at
once
by
a
restriction
on
land
sales
to
actual
settlers
and
it
promises
other
advantages
to
the
country
in
general
and
to
the
new
states
in
particular
which
can
not
fail
to
receive
the
most
profound
consideration
of
congress
experience
continues
to
realize
the
expectations
entertained
as
to
the
capacity
of
the
state
banks
to
perform
the
duties
of
fiscal
agents
for
the
government
at
the
time
of
the
removal
of
the
deposits
it
was
alleged
by
the
advocates
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
that
the
state
banks
what
ever
might
be
the
regulations
of
the
treasury
department
could
not
make
the
transfers
required
by
the
government
or
negotiate
the
domestic
exchanges
of
the
country
it
is
now
well
ascertained
that
the
real
domestic
exchanges
performed
through
discounts
by
the
united
states
bank
and
its
branches
were
at
least
one
third
less
than
those
of
the
deposit
banks
for
an
equal
period
of
time
and
if
a
comparison
be
instituted
between
the
amounts
of
service
rendered
by
these
institutions
on
the
broader
basis
which
has
been
used
by
the
advocates
of
the
united
states
bank
in
estimating
what
they
consider
the
domestic
exchanges
transacted
by
it
the
result
will
be
still
more
favorable
to
the
deposit
banks
the
whole
amount
of
public
money
transferred
by
the
bank
of
the
united
states
in
was
the
amount
transferred
and
actually
paid
by
the
deposit
banks
in
the
year
ending
the
first
of
october
last
was
the
amount
transferred
and
paid
between
that
period
and
the
th
of
november
was
and
the
amount
of
transfer
warrants
outstanding
on
that
day
was
making
an
aggregate
of
these
enormous
sums
of
money
first
mentioned
have
been
transferred
with
the
greatest
promptitude
and
regularity
and
the
rates
at
which
the
exchanges
have
been
negotiated
previously
to
the
passage
of
the
deposit
act
were
generally
below
those
charged
by
the
bank
of
the
united
states
independently
of
these
services
which
are
far
greater
than
those
rendered
by
the
united
states
bank
and
its
branches
a
number
of
the
deposit
banks
have
with
a
commendable
zeal
to
aid
in
the
improvement
of
the
currency
imported
from
abroad
at
their
own
expense
large
sums
of
the
precious
metals
for
coinage
and
circulation
in
the
same
manner
have
nearly
all
the
predictions
turned
out
in
respect
to
the
effect
of
the
removal
of
the
depositsa
step
unquestionably
necessary
to
prevent
the
evils
which
it
was
foreseen
the
bank
itself
would
endeavor
to
create
in
a
final
struggle
to
procure
a
renewal
of
its
charter
it
may
be
thus
too
in
some
degree
with
the
further
steps
which
may
be
taken
to
prevent
the
excessive
issue
of
other
bank
paper
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
nothing
will
now
deter
the
federal
and
state
authorities
from
the
firm
and
vigorous
performance
of
their
duties
to
themselves
and
to
the
people
in
this
respect
in
reducing
the
revenue
to
the
wants
of
the
government
your
particular
attention
is
invited
to
those
articles
which
constitute
the
necessaries
of
life
the
duty
on
salt
was
laid
as
a
war
tax
and
was
no
doubt
continued
to
assist
in
providing
for
the
payment
of
the
war
debt
there
is
no
article
the
release
of
which
from
taxation
would
be
felt
so
generally
and
so
beneficially
to
this
may
be
added
all
kinds
of
fuel
and
provisions
justice
and
benevolence
unite
in
favor
of
releasing
the
poor
of
our
cities
from
burdens
which
are
not
necessary
to
the
support
of
our
government
and
tend
only
to
increase
the
wants
of
the
destitute
it
will
be
seen
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
accompanying
documents
that
the
bank
of
the
united
states
has
made
no
payment
on
account
of
the
stock
held
by
the
government
in
that
institution
although
urged
to
pay
any
portion
which
might
suit
its
convenience
and
that
it
has
given
no
information
when
payment
may
be
expected
nor
although
repeatedly
requested
has
it
furnished
the
information
in
relation
to
its
condition
which
congress
authorized
the
secretary
to
collect
at
their
last
session
such
measures
as
are
within
the
power
of
the
executive
have
been
taken
to
ascertain
the
value
of
the
stock
and
procure
the
payment
as
early
as
possible
the
conduct
and
present
condition
of
that
bank
and
the
great
amount
of
capital
vested
in
it
by
the
united
states
require
your
careful
attention
its
charter
expired
on
the
third
day
of
march
last
and
it
has
now
no
power
but
that
given
in
the
twentyfirst
section
to
use
the
corporate
name
style
and
capacity
for
the
purpose
of
suits
for
the
final
settlement
and
liquidation
of
the
affairs
and
accounts
of
the
corporation
and
for
the
sale
and
disposition
of
their
estatereal
personal
and
mixedbut
not
for
any
other
purpose
or
in
any
other
manner
what
so
ever
nor
for
a
period
exceeding
two
years
after
the
expiration
of
the
said
term
of
incorporation
before
the
expiration
of
the
charter
the
stockholders
of
the
bank
obtained
an
act
of
incorporation
from
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
excluding
only
the
united
states
instead
of
proceeding
to
wind
up
their
concerns
and
pay
over
to
the
united
states
the
amount
due
on
account
of
the
stock
held
by
them
the
president
and
directors
of
the
old
bank
appear
to
have
transferred
the
books
papers
notes
obligations
and
most
or
all
of
its
property
to
this
new
corporation
which
entered
upon
business
as
a
continuation
of
the
old
concern
amongst
other
acts
of
questionable
validity
the
notes
of
the
expired
corporation
are
known
to
have
been
used
as
its
own
and
again
put
in
circulation
that
the
old
bank
had
no
right
to
issue
or
reissue
its
notes
after
the
expiration
of
its
charter
can
not
be
denied
and
that
it
could
not
confer
any
such
right
on
its
substitute
any
more
than
exercise
it
itself
is
equally
plain
in
law
and
honesty
the
notes
of
the
bank
in
circulation
at
the
expiration
of
its
charter
should
have
been
called
in
by
public
advertisement
paid
up
as
presented
and
together
with
those
on
hand
canceled
and
destroyed
their
reissue
is
sanctioned
by
no
law
and
warranted
by
no
necessity
if
the
united
states
be
responsible
in
their
stock
for
the
payment
of
these
notes
their
reissue
by
the
new
corporation
for
their
own
profit
is
a
fraud
on
the
government
if
the
united
states
is
not
responsible
then
there
is
no
legal
responsibility
in
any
quarter
and
it
is
a
fraud
on
the
country
they
are
the
redeemed
notes
of
a
dissolved
partnership
but
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
retiring
partner
and
without
his
consent
are
again
reissued
and
circulated
it
is
the
high
and
peculiar
duty
of
congress
to
decide
whether
any
further
legislation
be
necessary
for
the
security
of
the
large
amount
of
public
property
now
held
and
in
use
by
the
new
bank
and
for
vindicating
the
rights
of
the
government
and
compelling
a
speedy
and
honest
settlement
with
all
the
creditors
of
the
old
bank
public
and
private
or
whether
the
subject
shall
be
left
to
the
power
now
possessed
by
the
executive
and
judiciary
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
persons
who
as
managers
of
the
old
bank
undertook
to
control
the
government
retained
the
public
dividends
shut
their
doors
upon
a
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
filled
the
country
with
panic
to
accomplish
their
own
sini
ster
objects
may
now
as
managers
of
a
new
bank
continue
with
impunity
to
flood
the
country
with
a
spurious
currency
use
the
millions
of
government
stock
for
their
own
profit
and
refuse
to
the
united
states
all
information
as
to
the
present
condition
of
their
own
property
and
the
prospect
of
recovering
it
into
their
own
possession
the
lessons
taught
by
the
bank
of
the
united
states
can
not
well
be
lost
upon
the
american
people
they
will
take
care
never
again
to
place
so
tremendous
a
power
in
irresponsible
hands
and
it
will
be
fortunate
if
they
seriously
consider
the
consequences
which
are
likely
to
result
on
a
smaller
scale
from
the
facility
with
which
corporate
powers
are
granted
by
their
state
governments
it
is
believed
that
the
law
of
the
last
session
regulating
the
deposit
banks
operates
onerously
and
unjustly
upon
them
in
many
respects
and
it
is
hoped
that
congress
on
proper
representations
will
adopt
the
modifications
which
are
necessary
to
prevent
this
consequence
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
ad
interim
and
the
accompanying
documents
all
which
are
herewith
laid
before
you
will
give
you
a
full
view
of
the
diversified
and
important
operations
of
that
department
during
the
past
year
the
military
movements
rendered
necessary
by
the
aggressions
of
the
hostile
portions
of
the
seminole
and
creek
tribes
of
indians
and
by
other
circumstances
have
required
the
active
employment
of
nearly
our
whole
regular
force
including
the
marine
corps
and
of
large
bodies
of
militia
and
volunteers
with
all
these
events
so
far
as
they
were
known
at
the
seat
of
government
before
the
termination
of
your
last
session
you
are
already
acquainted
and
it
is
therefore
only
needful
in
this
place
to
lay
before
you
a
brief
summary
of
what
has
since
occurred
the
war
with
the
seminoles
during
the
summer
was
on
our
part
chiefly
confined
to
the
protection
of
our
frontier
settlements
from
the
incursions
of
the
enemy
and
as
a
necessary
and
important
means
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
end
to
the
maintenance
of
the
posts
previously
established
in
the
course
of
this
duty
several
actions
took
place
in
which
the
bravery
and
discipline
of
both
officers
and
men
were
conspicuously
displayed
and
which
i
have
deemed
it
proper
to
notice
in
respect
to
the
former
by
the
granting
of
brevet
rank
for
gallant
services
in
the
field
but
as
the
force
of
the
indians
was
not
so
far
weakened
by
these
partial
successes
as
to
lead
them
to
submit
and
as
their
savage
inroads
were
frequently
repeated
early
measures
were
taken
for
placing
at
the
disposal
of
governor
call
who
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
territorial
militia
had
been
temporarily
invested
with
the
command
an
ample
force
for
the
purpose
of
resuming
offensive
operations
in
the
most
efficient
manner
so
soon
as
the
season
should
permit
major
general
jesup
was
also
directed
on
the
conclusion
of
his
duties
in
the
creek
country
to
repair
to
florida
and
assume
the
command
the
result
of
the
first
movement
made
by
the
forces
under
the
direction
of
governor
call
in
october
last
as
detailed
in
the
accompanying
papers
excited
much
surprise
and
disappointment
a
full
explanation
has
been
required
of
the
causes
which
led
to
the
failure
of
that
movement
but
has
not
yet
been
received
in
the
mean
time
as
it
was
feared
that
the
health
of
governor
call
who
was
understood
to
have
suffered
much
from
sickness
might
not
be
adequate
to
the
crisis
and
as
major
general
jesup
was
known
to
have
reached
florida
that
officer
was
directed
to
assume
command
and
to
prosecute
all
needful
operations
with
the
utmost
promptitude
and
vigor
from
the
force
at
his
disposal
and
the
dispositions
he
has
made
and
is
instructed
to
make
and
from
the
very
efficient
measures
which
it
is
since
ascertained
have
been
taken
by
governor
call
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
they
will
soon
be
enabled
to
reduce
the
enemy
to
subjection
in
the
mean
time
as
you
will
perceive
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
there
is
urgent
necessity
for
further
appropriations
to
suppress
these
hostilities
happily
for
the
interests
of
humanity
the
hostilities
with
the
creeks
were
brought
to
a
close
soon
after
your
adjournment
without
that
effusion
of
blood
which
at
one
time
was
apprehended
as
inevitable
the
unconditional
submission
of
the
hostile
party
was
followed
by
their
speedy
removal
to
the
country
assigned
them
west
of
the
mississippi
the
inquiry
as
to
alleged
frauds
in
the
purchase
of
the
reservations
of
these
indians
and
the
causes
of
their
hostilities
requested
by
the
resolution
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
first
of
july
last
july
st
to
be
made
by
the
president
is
now
going
on
through
the
agency
of
commissioners
appointed
for
that
purpose
their
report
may
be
expected
during
your
present
session
the
difficulties
apprehended
in
the
cherokee
country
have
been
prevented
and
the
peace
and
safety
of
that
region
and
its
vicinity
effectually
secured
by
the
timely
measures
taken
by
the
war
department
and
still
continued
the
discretionary
authority
given
to
general
gaines
to
cross
the
sabine
and
to
occupy
a
position
as
far
west
as
nacogdoches
in
case
he
should
deem
such
a
step
necessary
to
the
protection
of
the
frontier
and
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
stipulations
contained
in
our
treaty
with
mexico
and
the
movement
subsequently
made
by
that
officer
have
been
alluded
to
in
a
former
part
of
this
message
at
the
date
of
the
latest
intelligence
from
nacogdoches
our
troops
were
yet
at
that
station
but
the
officer
who
has
succeeded
general
gaines
has
recently
been
advised
that
from
the
facts
known
at
the
seat
of
government
there
would
seem
to
be
no
adequate
cause
for
any
longer
maintaining
that
position
and
he
was
accordingly
instructed
in
case
the
troops
were
not
already
withdrawn
under
the
discretionary
powers
before
possessed
by
him
to
give
the
requisite
orders
for
that
purpose
on
the
receipt
of
the
instructions
unless
he
shall
then
have
in
his
possession
such
information
as
shall
satisfy
him
that
the
maintenance
of
the
post
is
essential
to
the
protection
of
our
frontiers
and
to
the
due
execution
of
our
treaty
stipulations
as
previously
explained
to
him
whilst
the
necessities
existing
during
the
present
year
for
the
service
of
militia
and
volunteers
have
furnished
new
proofs
of
the
patriotism
of
our
fellow
citizens
they
have
also
strongly
illustrated
the
importance
of
an
increase
in
the
rank
and
file
of
the
regular
army
the
views
of
this
subject
submitted
by
the
secretary
of
war
in
his
report
meet
my
entire
concurrence
and
are
earnestly
commended
to
the
deliberate
attention
of
congress
in
this
connection
it
is
also
proper
to
remind
you
that
the
defects
in
our
present
militia
system
are
every
day
rendered
more
apparent
the
duty
of
making
further
provision
by
law
for
organizing
arming
and
disciplining
this
arm
of
defense
has
been
so
repeatedly
presented
to
congress
by
myself
and
my
predecessors
that
i
deem
it
sufficient
on
this
occasion
to
refer
to
the
last
annual
message
and
to
former
executive
communications
in
which
the
subject
has
been
discussed
it
appears
from
the
reports
of
the
officers
charged
with
mustering
into
service
the
volunteers
called
for
under
the
act
of
congress
of
the
last
session
that
more
presented
themselves
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
in
tennessee
than
were
sufficient
to
meet
the
requisition
which
had
been
made
by
the
secretary
of
war
upon
the
governor
of
that
state
this
was
occasioned
by
the
omission
of
the
governor
to
apportion
the
requisition
to
the
different
regiments
of
militia
so
as
to
obtain
the
proper
number
of
troops
and
no
more
it
seems
but
just
to
the
patriotic
citizens
who
repaired
to
the
general
rendezvous
under
circumstances
authorizing
them
to
believe
that
their
services
were
needed
and
would
be
accepted
that
the
expenses
incurred
by
them
while
absent
from
their
homes
should
be
paid
by
the
government
i
accordingly
recommend
that
a
law
to
this
effect
be
passed
by
congress
giving
them
a
compensation
which
will
cover
their
expenses
on
the
march
to
and
from
the
place
of
rendezvous
and
while
there
in
connection
with
which
it
will
also
be
proper
to
make
provision
for
such
other
equitable
claims
growing
out
of
the
service
of
the
militia
as
may
not
be
embraced
in
the
existing
laws
on
the
unexpected
breaking
out
of
hostilities
in
florida
alabama
and
georgia
it
became
necessary
in
some
cases
to
take
the
property
of
individuals
for
public
use
provision
should
be
made
by
law
for
indemnifying
the
owners
and
i
would
also
respectfully
suggest
whether
some
provision
may
not
be
made
consistently
with
the
principles
of
our
government
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferers
by
indian
depredations
or
by
the
operations
of
our
own
troops
no
time
was
lost
after
the
making
of
the
requisite
appropriations
in
resuming
the
great
national
work
of
completing
the
unfinished
fortifications
on
our
seaboard
and
of
placing
them
in
a
proper
state
of
defense
in
consequence
however
of
the
very
late
day
at
which
those
bills
were
passed
but
little
progress
could
be
made
during
the
season
which
has
just
closed
a
very
large
amount
of
the
moneys
granted
at
your
last
session
accordingly
remains
unexpended
but
as
the
work
will
be
again
resumed
at
the
earliest
moment
in
the
coming
spring
the
balance
of
the
existing
appropriations
and
in
several
cases
which
will
be
laid
before
you
with
the
proper
estimates
further
sums
for
the
like
objects
may
be
usefully
expended
during
the
next
year
the
recommendations
of
an
increase
in
the
engineer
corps
and
for
a
reorganization
of
the
topographical
corps
submitted
to
you
in
my
last
annual
message
derive
additional
strength
from
the
great
embarrassments
experienced
during
the
present
year
in
those
branches
of
the
service
and
under
which
they
are
now
suffering
several
of
the
most
important
surveys
and
constructions
directed
by
recent
laws
have
been
suspended
in
consequence
of
the
want
of
adequate
force
in
these
corps
the
like
observations
may
be
applied
to
the
ordnance
corps
and
to
the
general
staff
the
operations
of
which
as
they
are
now
organized
must
either
be

frequently
interrupted
or
performed
by
officers
taken
from
the
line
of
the
army
to
the
great
prejudice
of
the
service
for
a
general
view
of
the
condition
of
the
military
academy
and
of
other
branches
of
the
military
service
not
already
noticed
as
well
as
for
further
illustrations
of
those
which
have
been
mentioned
i
refer
you
to
the
accompanying
documents
and
among
the
various
proposals
contained
therein
for
legislative
action
i
would
particularly
notice
the
suggestion
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
the
revision
of
the
pay
of
the
army
as
entitled
to
your
favorable
regard
the
national
policy
founded
alike
in
interest
and
in
humanity
so
long
and
so
steadily
pursued
by
this
government
for
the
removal
of
the
indian
tribes
originally
settled
on
this
side
of
the
mississippi
to
the
w
of
that
river
may
be
said
to
have
been
consummated
by
the
conclusion
of
the
late
treaty
with
the
cherokees
the
measures
taken
in
the
execution
of
that
treaty
and
in
relation
to
our
indian
affairs
generally
will
fully
appear
by
referring
to
the
accompanying
papers
without
dwelling
on
the
numerous
and
important
topics
embraced
in
them
i
again
invite
your
attention
to
the
importance
of
providing
a
welldigested
and
comprehensive
system
for
the
protection
supervision
and
improvement
of
the
various
tribes
now
planted
in
the
indian
country
the
suggestions
submitted
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
enforced
by
the
secretary
on
this
subject
and
also
in
regard
to
the
establishment
of
additional
military
posts
in
the
indian
country
are
entitled
to
your
profound
consideration
both
measures
are
necessary
for
the
double
purpose
of
protecting
the
indians
from
intestine
war
and
in
other
respects
complying
with
our
engagements
with
them
and
of
securing
our
western
frontier
against
incursions
which
otherwise
will
assuredly
be
made
on
it
the
best
hopes
of
humanity
in
regard
to
the
aboriginal
race
the
welfare
of
our
rapidly
extending
settlements
and
the
honor
of
the
united
states
are
all
deeply
involved
in
the
relations
existing
between
this
government
and
the
emigrating
tribes
i
trust
therefore
that
the
various
matters
submitted
in
the
accompanying
documents
in
respect
to
those
relations
will
receive
your
early
and
mature
deliberation
and
that
it
may
issue
in
the
adoption
of
legislative
measures
adapted
to
the
circumstances
and
duties
of
the
present
crisis
you
are
referred
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
a
satisfactory
view
of
the
operations
of
the
department
under
his
charge
during
the
present
year
in
the
construction
of
vessels
at
the
different
navy
yards
and
in
the
employment
of
our
ships
and
squadrons
at
sea
that
branch
of
the
service
has
been
actively
and
usefully
employed
while
the
situation
of
our
commercial
interests
in
the
west
indies
required
a
greater
number
than
usual
of
armed
vessels
to
be
kept
on
that
station
it
is
gratifying
to
perceive
that
the
protection
due
to
our
commerce
in
other
quarters
of
the
world
has
not
proved
insufficient
every
effort
has
been
made
to
facilitate
the
equipment
of
the
exploring
expedition
authorized
by
the
act
of
the
last
session
but
all
the
preparation
necessary
to
enable
it
to
sail
has
not
yet
been
completed
no
means
will
be
spared
by
the
government
to
fit
out
the
expedition
on
a
scale
corresponding
with
the
liberal
appropriations
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
elevated
character
of
the
objects
which
are
to
be
effected
by
it
i
beg
leave
to
renew
the
recommendation
made
in
my
last
annual
message
respecting
the
enlistment
of
boys
in
our
naval
service
and
to
urge
upon
your
attention
the
necessity
of
further
appropriations
to
increase
the
number
of
ships
afloat
and
to
enlarge
generally
the
capacity
and
force
of
the
navy
the
increase
of
our
commerce
and
our
position
in
regard
to
the
other
powers
of
the
world
will
always
make
it
our
policy
and
interest
to
cherish
the
great
naval
resources
of
our
country
the
report
of
the
post
master
general
presents
a
gratifying
picture
of
the
condition
of
the
post
office
department
its
revenues
for
the
year
ending
the
th
june
last
were
showing
an
increase
of
revenue
over
that
of
the
preceding
year
of
or
more
than
the
expenditures
for
the
same
year
were
exhibiting
a
surplus
of
the
department
has
been
redeemed
from
embarrassment
and
debt
has
accumulated
a
surplus
exceeding
half
a
million
dollars
has
largely
extended
and
is
preparing
still
further
to
extend
the
mail
service
and
recommends
a
reduction
of
postages
equal
to
about
it
is
practicing
upon
the
great
principle
which
should
control
every
branch
of
our
government
of
rendering
to
the
public
the
greatest
good
possible
with
the
least
possible
taxation
to
the
people
the
scale
of
postages
suggested
by
the
post
master
general
recommends
itself
not
only
by
the
reduction
it
proposes
but
by
the
simplicity
of
its
arrangement
its
conformity
with
the
federal
currency
and
the
improvement
it
will
introduce
into
the
accounts
of
the
department
and
its
agents
your
particular
attention
is
invited
to
the
subject
of
mail
contracts
with
railroad
companies
the
present
laws
providing
for
the
making
of
contracts
are
based
upon
the
presumption
that
competition
among
bidders
will
secure
the
service
at
a
fair
price
but
on
most
of
the
railroad
lines
there
is
no
competition
in
that
kind
of
transportation
and
advertising
is
therefore
useless
no
contract
can
now
be
made
with
them
except
such
as
shall
be
negotiated
before
the
time
of
offering
or
afterwards
and
the
power
of
the
post
master
general
to
pay
them
high
prices
is
practically
without
limitation
it
would
be
a
relief
to
him
and
no
doubt
would
conduce
to
the
public
interest
to
prescribe
by
law
some
equitable
basis
upon
which
such
contracts
shall
rest
and
restrict
him
by
a
fixed
rule
of
allowance
under
a
liberal
act
of
that
sort
he
would
undoubtedly
be
able
to
secure
the
services
of
most
of
the
railroad
companies
and
the
interest
of
the
department
would
be
thus
advanced
the
correspondence
between
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
the
european
nations
and
particularly
with
the
british
islands
has
become
very
extensive
and
requires
the
interposition
of
congress
to
give
it
security
no
obstacle
is
perceived
to
an
interchange
of
mails
between
new
york
and
liverpool
or
other
foreign
ports
as
proposed
by
the
post
master
general
on
the
contrary
it
promises
by
the
security
it
will
afford
to
facilitate
commercial
transactions
and
give
rise
to
an
enlarged
intercourse
among
the
people
of
different
nations
which
can
not
but
have
a
happy
effect
through
the
city
of
new
york
most
of
the
correspondence
between
the
canadas
and
europe
is
now
carried
on
and
urgent
representations
have
been
received
from
the
head
of
the
provincial
post
office
asking
the
interposition
of
the
united
states
to
guard
it
from
the
accidents
and
losses
to
which
it
is
now
subjected
some
legislation
appears
to
be
called
for
as
well
by
our
own
interest
as
by
comity
to
the
adjoining
british
provinces
the
expediency
of
providing
a
fireproof
building
for
the
important
books
and
papers
of
the
post
office
department
is
worthy
of
consideration
in
the
present
condition
of
our
treasury
it
is
neither
necessary
nor
wise
to
leave
essential
public
interests
exposed
to
so
much
danger
when
they
can
so
readily
be
made
secure
there
are
weighty
considerations
in
the
location
of
a
new
building
for
that
department
in
favor
of
placing
it
near
the
other
executive
buildings
the
important
subjects
of
a
survey
of
the
coast
and
the
manufacture
of
a
standard
of
weights
and
measures
for
the
different
custom
houses
have
been
in
progress
for
some
years
under
the
general
direction
of
the
executive
and
the
immediate
superintendence
of
a
gentleman
possessing
high
scientific
attainments
at
the
last
session
of
congress
the
making
of
a
set
of
weights
and
measures
for
each
state
in
the
union
was
added
to
the
others
by
a
joint
resolution
the
care
and
correspondence
as
to
all
these
subjects
have
been
devolved
on
the
treasury
department
during
the
last
year
a
special
report
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
soon
be
communicated
to
congress
which
will
show
what
has
been
accomplished
as
to
the
whole
the
number
and
compensation
of
the
persons
now
employed
in
these
duties
and
the
progress
expected
to
be
made
during
the
ensuing
year
with
a
copy
of
the
various
correspondence
deemed
necessary
to
throw
light
on
the
subjects
which
seem
to
require
additional
legislation
claims
have
been
made
for
retrospective
allowances
in
behalf
of
the
superintendent
and
some
of
his
assistants
which
i
did
not
feel
justified
in
granting
other
claims
have
been
made
for
large
increases
in
compensation
which
under
the
circumstances
of
the
several
cases
i
declined
making
without
the
express
sanction
of
congress
in
order
to
obtain
that
sanction
the
subject
was
at
the
last
session
on
my
suggestion
and
by
request
of
the
immediate
superintendent
submitted
by
the
treasury
department
to
the
committee
on
commerce
of
the
house
of
representatives
but
no
legislative
action
having
taken
place
the
early
attention
of
congress
is
now
invited
to
the
enactment
of
some
express
and
detailed
provisions
in
relation
to
the
various
claims
made
for
the
past
and
to
the
compensation
and
allowances
deemed
proper
for
the
future
it
is
further
respectfully
recommended
that
such
being
the
inconvenience
of
attention
to
these
duties
by
the
chief
magistrate
and
such
the
great
pressure
of
business
on
the
treasury
department
the
general
supervision
of
the
coast
survey
and
the
completion
of
the
weights
and
measures
if
the
works
are
kept
united
should
be
devolved
on
a
board
of
officers
organized
specially
for
that
purpose
or
on
the
navy
board
attached
to
the
navy
department
all
my
experience
and
reflection
confirm
the
conviction
i
have
so
often
expressed
to
congress
in
favor
of
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
which
will
prevent
in
any
event
the
election
of
the
president
and
vice
president
of
the
united
states
devolving
on
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
and
i
therefore
beg
leave
again
to
solicit
your
attention
to
the

subject
there
were
various
other
suggestions
in
my
last
annual
message
not
acted
upon
particularly
that
relating
to
the
want
of
uniformity
in
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia
that
are
deemed
worthy
of
your
favorable
consideration
before
concluding
this
paper
i
think
it
due
to
the
various
executive
departments
to
bear
testimony
to
their
prosperous
condition
and
to
the
ability
and
integrity
with
which
they
have
been
conducted
it
has
been
my
aim
to
enforce
in
all
of
them
a
vigilant
and
faithful
discharge
of
the
public
business
and
it
is
gratifying
to
me
to
believe
that
there
is
no
just
cause
of
complaint
from
any
quarter
at
the
manner
in
which
they
have
fulfilled
the
objects
of
their
creation
having
now
finished
the
observations
deemed
proper
on
this
the
last
occasion
i
shall
have
of
communicating
with
the
two
houses
of
congress
at
their
meeting
i
can
not
omit
an
expression
of
the
gratitude
which
is
due
to
the
great
body
of
my
fellow
citizens
in
whose
partiality
and
indulgence
i
have
found
encouragement
and
support
in
the
many
difficult
and
trying
scenes
through
which
it
has
been
my
lot
to
pass
during
my
public
career
though
deeply
sensible
that
my
exertions
have
not
been
crowned
with
a
success
corresponding
to
the
degree
of
favor
bestowed
upon
me
i
am
sure
that
they
will
be
considered
as
having
been
directed
by
an
earnest
desire
to
promote
the
good
of
my
country
and
i
am
consoled
by
the
persuasion
that
what
ever
errors
have
been
committed
will
find
a
corrective
in
the
intelligence
and
patriotism
of
those
who
will
succeed
us
all
that
has
occurred
during
my
administration
is
calculated
to
inspire
me
with
increased
confidence
in
the
stability
of
our
institutions
and
should
i
be
spared
to
enter
upon
that
retirement
which
is
so
suitable
to
my
age
and
infirm
health
and
so
much
desired
by
me
in
other
respects
i
shall
not
cease
to
invoke
that
beneficent
being
to
whose
providence
we
are
already
so
signally
indebted
for
the
continuance
of
his
blessings
on
our
beloved
country

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
discharge
of
my
official
duty
the
again
devolves
upon
me
of
communicating
with
a
new
congress
the
reflection
that
the
representation
of
the
union
has
been
recently
renewed
and
that
the
constitutional
term
of
its
service
will
expire
with
my
own
heightens
the
solicitude
with
which
i
shall
attempt
to
lay
before
it
the
state
of
our
national
concerns
and
the
devout
hope
which
i
cherish
that
its
labors
to
improve
them
may
be
crowned
with
success
you
are
assembled
at
a
period
of
profound
interest
to
the
american
patriot
the
unexampled
growth
and
prosperity
of
our
country
having
given
us
a
rank
in
the
scale
of
nations
which
removes
all
apprehension
of
danger
to
our
integrity
and
independence
from
external
foes
the
career
of
freedom
is
before
us
with
an
earnest
from
the
past
that
if
true
to
ourselves
there
can
be
no
formidable
obstacle
in
the
future
to
its
peaceful
and
uninterrupted
pursuit
yet
in
proportion
to
the
disappearance
of
those
apprehensions
which
attended
our
weakness
as
once
contrasted
with
the
power
of
some
of
the
states
of
the
old
world
should
we
now
be
solicitous
as
to
those
which
belong
to
the
conviction
that
it
is
to
our
own
conduct
we
must
look
for
the
preservation
of
those
causes
on
which
depend
the
excellence
and
the
duration
of
our
happy
system
of
government
in
the
example
of
other
systems
founded
on
the
will
of
the
people
we
trace
to
internal
dissension
the
influences
which
have
so
often
blasted
the
hopes
of
the
friends
of
freedom
the
social
elements
which
were
strong
and
successful
when
united
against
external
danger
failed
in
the
more
difficult
task
of
properly
adjusting
their
own
internal
organization
and
thus
gave
way
the
great
principle
of
selfgovernment
let
us
trust
that
this
admonition
will
never
be
forgotten
by
the
government
or
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
testimony
which
our
experience
thus
far
holds
out
to
the
great
human
family
of
the
practicability
and
the
blessings
of
free
government
will
be
confirmed
in
all
time
to
come
we
have
but
to
look
at
the
state
of
our
agriculture
manufactures
and
commerce
and
the
unexampled
increase
of
our
population
to
feel
the
magnitude
of
the
trust
committed
to
us
never
in
any
former
period
of
our
history
have
we
had
greater
reason
than
we
now
have
to
be
thankful
to
divine
providence
for
the
blessings
of
health
and
general
prosperity
every
branch
of
labor
we
see
crowned
with
the
most
abundant
rewards
in
every
element
of
national
resources
and
wealth
and
of
individual
comfort
we
witness
the
most
rapid
and
solid
improvements
with
no
interruptions
to
this
pleasing
prospect
at
home
which
will
not
yield
to
the
spirit
of
harmony
and
good
will
that
so
strikingly
pervades
the
mass
of
the
people
in
every
quarter
amidst
all
the
diversity
of
interest
and
pursuits
to
which
they
are
attached
and
with
no
cause
of
solicitude
in
regard
to
our
external
affairs
which
will
not
it
is
hoped
disappear
before
the
principles
of
simple
justice
and
the
forbearance
that
mark
our
intercourse
with
foreign
powers
we
have
every
reason
to
feel
proud
of
our
beloved
country
the
general
state
of
our
foreign
relations
has
not
materially
changed
since
my
last
annual
message
in
the
settlement
of
the
question
of
the
north
eastern
boundary
little
progress
has
been
made
great
britain
has
declined
acceding
to
the
proposition
of
the
united
states
presented
in
accordance
with
the
resolution
of
the
senate
unless
certain
preliminary
conditions
were
admitted
which
i
deemed
incompatible
with
a
satisfactory
and
rightful
adjustment
of
the
controversy
waiting
for
some
distinct
proposal
from
the
government
of
great
britain
which
has
been
invited
i
can
only
repeat
the
expression
of
my
confidence
that
with
the
strong
mutual
disposition
which
i
believe
exists
to
make
a
just
arrangement
this
perplexing
question
can
be
settled
with
a
due
regard
to
the
wellfounded
pretensions
and
pacific
policy
of
all
the
parties
to
it
events
are
frequently
occurring
on
the
north
eastern
frontier
of
a
character
to
impress
upon
all
the
necessity
of
a
speedy
and
definitive
termination
of
the
dispute
this
consideration
added
to
the
desire
common
to
both
to
relieve
the
liberal
and
friendly
relations
so
happily
existing
between
the
two
countries
from
all
embarrassment
will
no
doubt
have
its
just
influence
upon
both
our
diplomatic
intercourse
with
portugal
has
been
renewed
and
it
is
expected
that
the
claims
of
our
citizens
partially
paid
will
be
fully
satisfied
as
soon
as
the
condition
of
the
queens
government
will
permit
the
proper
attention
to
the
subject
of
them
that
government
has
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
manifested
a
determination
to
act
upon
the
liberal
principles
which
have
marked
our
commercial
policy
the
happiest
effects
upon
the
future
trade
between
the
united
states
and
portugal
are
anticipated
from
it
and
the
time
is
not
thought
to
be
remote
when
a
system
of
perfect
reciprocity
will
be
established
the
installments
due
under
the
convention
with
the
king
of
the
two
sicilies
have
been
paid
with
that
scrupulous
fidelity
by
which
his
whole
conduct
has
been
characterized
and
the
hope
is
indulged
that
the
adjustment
of
the
vexed
question
of
our
claims
will
be
followed
by
a
more
extended
and
mutually
beneficial
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
the
internal
contest
still
continues
in
spain
distinguished
as
this
struggle
has
unhappily
been
by
incidents
of
the
most
sanguinary
character
the
obligations
of
the
late
treaty
of
indemnification
with
us
have
been
never
the
less
faithfully
executed
by
the
spanish
government
no
provision
having
been
made
at
the
last
session
of
congress
for
the
ascertainment
of
the
claims
to
be
paid
and
the
apportionment
of
the
funds
under
the
convention
made
with
spain
i
invite
your
early
attention
to
the
subject
the
public
evidences
of
the
debt
have
according
to
the
terms
of
the
convention
and
in
the
forms
prescribed
by
it
been
placed
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
and
the
interest
as
it
fell
due
has
been
regularly
paid
upon
them
our
commercial
intercourse
with
cuba
stands
as
regulated
by
the
act
of
congress
no
recent
information
has
been
received
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
government
of
madrid
and
the
lamented
death
of
our
recently
appointed
minister
on
his
way
to
spain
with
the
pressure
of
their
affairs
at
home
renders
it
scarcely
probable
that
any
change
is
to
be
looked
for
during
the
coming
year
further
portions
of
the
florida
archives
have
been
sent
to
the
united
states
although
the
death
of
one
of
the
commissioners
at
a
critical
moment
embarrassed
the
progress
of
the
delivery
of
them
the
higher
officers
of
the
local
government
have
recently
shown
an
anxious
desire
in
compliance
with
the
orders
from
the
parent
government
to
facilitate
the
selection
and
delivery
of
all
we
have
a
right
to
claim
negotiations
have
been
opened
at
madrid
for
the
establishment
of
a
lasting
peace
between
spain
and
such
of
the
spanish
american
governments
of
this
hemisphere
as
have
availed
themselves
of
the
intimation
given
to
all
of
them
of
the
disposition
of
spain
to
treat
upon
the
basis
of
their
entire
independence
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
simultaneous
appointments
by
all
of
ministers
to
negotiate
with
spain
had
not
been
made
the
negotiation
itself
would
have
been
simplified
and
this
longstanding
dispute
spreading
over
a
large
portion
of
the
world
would
have
been
brought
to
a
more
speedy
conclusion
our
political
and
commercial
relations
with
austria
prussia
sweden
and
denmark
stand
on
the
usual
favorable
bases
one
of
the
articles
of
our
treaty
with
russia
in
relation
to
the
trade
on
the
northwest
coast
of
america
having
expired
instructions
have
been
given
to
our
minister
at
st
petersburg
to
negotiate
a
renewal
of
it
the
long
and
unbroken
amity
between
the
two
governments
gives
every
reason
for
supposing
the
article
will
be
renewed
if
stronger
motives
do
not
exist
to
prevent
it
than
with
our
view
of
the
subject
can
be
anticipated
here
i
ask
your
attention
to
the
message
of
my
predecessor
at
the
opening
of
the
second
session
of
the
th
congress
relative
to
our
commercial
intercourse
with
holland
and
to
the
documents
connected
with
that
subject
communicated
to
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
th
of
january
and
th
of
january
coinciding
in
the
opinion
of
my
predecessor
that
holland
is
not
under
the
regulations
of
her
present
system
entitled
to
have
her
vessels
and
their
cargoes
received
into
the
united
states
on
the
footing
of
american
vessels
and
cargoes
as
regards
duties
of
tonnage
and
impost
a
respect
for
his
reference
of
it
to
the
legislature
has
alone
prevented
me
from
acting
on
the
subject
i
should
still
have
waited
without
comment
for
the
action
of
congress
but
recently
a
claim
has
been
made
by
belgian
subjects
to
admission
into
our
ports
for
their
ships
and
cargoes
on
the
same
footing
as
american
with
the
allegation
we
could
not
dispute
that
our
vessels
received
in
their
ports
the
identical
treatment
shewn
to
them
in
the
ports
of
holland
upon
whose
vessels
no
discrimination
is
made
in
the
ports
of
the
united
states
given
the
same
privileges
the
belgians
expected
the
same
benefits
benefits
that
were
in
fact
enjoyed
when
belgium
and
holland
were
united
under
one
government
satisfied
with
the
justice
of
their
pretension
to
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
with
holland
i
could
not
never
the
less
without
disregard
to
the
principle
of
our
laws
admit
their
claim
to
be
treated
as
americans
and
at
the
same
time
a
respect
for
congress
to
whom
the
subject
had
long
since
been
referred
has
prevented
me
from
producing
a
just
equality
by
taking
from
the
vessels
of
holland
privileges
conditionally
granted
by
acts
of
congress
although
the
condition
upon
which
the
grant
was
made
has
in
my
judgment
failed
since
i
recommend
therefore
a
review
of
the
act
of
and
such
modification
of
it
as
will
produce
an
equality
on
such
terms
as
congress
shall
think
best
comports
with
our
settled
policy
and
the
obligations
of
justice
to
two
friendly
powe
rs
with
the
sublime
porte
and
all
the
governments
on
the
coast
of
barbary
our
relations
continue
to
be
friendly
the
proper
steps
have
been
taken
to
renew
our
treaty
with
morocco
the
argentine
republic
has
again
promised
to
send
within
the
current
year
a
minister
to
the
united
states
a
convention
with
mexico
for
extending
the
time
for
the
appointment
of
commissioners
to
run
the
boundary
line
has
been
concluded
and
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
recent
events
in
that
country
have
awakened
the
liveliest
solicitude
in
the
united
states
aware
of
the
strong
temptations
existing
and
powerful
inducements
held
out
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
mingle
in
the
dissensions
of
our
immediate
neighbors
instructions
have
been
given
to
the
district
attorneys
of
the
united
states
where
indications
warranted
it
to
prosecute
without
respect
to
persons
all
who
might
attempt
to
violate
the
obligations
of
our
neutrality
while
at
the
same
time
it
has
been
thought
necessary
to
apprise
the
government
of
mexico
that
we
should
require
the
integrity
of
our
territory
to
be
scrupulously
respected
by
both
parties
from
our
diplomatic
agents
in
brazil
chile
peru
central
america
venezuela
and
new
granada
constant
assurances
are
received
of
the
continued
good
understanding
with
the
governments
to
which
they
are
severally
accredited
with
those
governments
upon
which
our
citizens
have
valid
and
accumulating
claims
scarcely
an
advance
toward
a
settlement
of
them
is
made
owing
mainly
to
their
distracted
state
or
to
the
pressure
of
imperative
domestic
questions
our
patience
has
been
and
will
probably
be
still
further
severely
tried
but
our
fellow
citizens
whose
interests
are
involved
may
confide
in
the
determination
of
the
government
to
obtain
for
them
eventually
ample
retribution
unfortunately
many
of
the
nations
of
this
hemisphere
are
still
selftormented
by
domestic
dissensions
revolution
succeeds
revolution
injuries
are
committed
upon
foreigners
engaged
in
lawful
pursuits
much
time
elapses
before
a
government
sufficiently
stable
is
erected
to
justify
expectation
of
redress
ministers
are
sent
and
received
and
before
the
discussions
of
past
injuries
are
fairly
begun
fresh
troubles
arise
but
too
frequently
new
injuries
are
added
to
the
old
to
be
discussed
together
with
the
existing
government
after
it
has
proved
its
ability
to
sustain
the
assaults
made
upon
it
or
with
its
successor
if
overthrown
if
this
unhappy
condition
of
things
continues
much
longer
other
nations
will
be
under
the
painful
necessity
of
deciding
whether
justice
to
their
suffering
citizens
does
not
require
a
prompt
redress
of
injuries
by
their
own
power
without
waiting
for
the
establishment
of
a
government
competent
and
enduring
enough
to
discuss
and
to
make
satisfaction
for
them
since
the
last
session
of
congress
the
validity
of
our
claims
upon
france
as
liquidated
by
the
treaty
of
has
been
acknowledged
by
both
branches
of
her
legislature
and
the
money
has
been
appropriated
for
their
discharge
but
the
payment
is
i
regret
to
inform
you
still
withheld
a
brief
recapitulation
of
the
most
important
incidents
in
this
protracted
controversy
will
shew
how
utterly
untenable
are
the
grounds
upon
which
this
course
is
attempted
to
be
justified
on
entering
upon
the
duties
of
my
station
i
found
the
united
states
an
unsuccessful
applicant
to
the
justice
of
france
for
the
satisfaction
of
claims
the
validity
of
which
was
never
questionable
and
has
now
been
most
solemnly
admitted
by
france
herself
the
antiquity
of
these
claims
their
high
justice
and
the
aggravating
circumstances
out
of
which
they
arose
are
too
familiar
to
the
american
people
to
require
description
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
for
a
period
of
ten
years
and
upward
our
commerce
was
with
but
little
interruption
the
subject
of
constant
aggression
on
the
part
of
franceaggressions
the
ordinary
features
of
which
were
condemnations
of
vessels
and
cargoes
under
arbitrary
decrees
adopted
in
contravention
as
well
of
the
laws
of
nations
as
of
treaty
stipulations
burnings
on
the
high
seas
and
seizures
and
confiscations
under
special
imperial
rescripts
in
the
ports
of
other
nations
occupied
by
the
armies
or
under
the
control
of
france
such
it
is
now
conceded
is
the
character
of
the
wrongs
we
sufferedwrongs
in
many
cases
so
flagrant
that
even
their
authors
never
denied
our
right
to
reparation
of
the
extent
of
these
injuries
some
conception
may
be
formed
from
the
fact
that
after
the
burning
of
a
large
amount
at
sea
and
the
necessary
deterioration
in
other
cases
by
long
detention
the
american
property
so
seized
and
sacrificed
at
forced
sales
excluding
what
was
adjudged
to
privateers
before
or
without
condemnation
brought
into
the
french
treasury
upward
of
francs
besides
large
custom
house
duties
the
subject
had
already
been
an
affair
of
years
uninterrupted
negotiation
except
for
a
short
time
when
france
was
overwhelmed
by
the
military
power
of
united
europe
during
this
period
whilst
other
nations
were
extorting
from
her
payment
of
their
claims
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
the
united
states
intermitted
their
demand
for
justice
out
of
respect
to
the
oppressed
condition
of
a
gallant
people
to
whom
they
felt
under
obligations
for
fraternal
assistance
in
their
own
days
of
suffering
and
peril
the
bad
effects
of
these
protracted
and
unavailing
discussions
were
obvious
and
the
line
of
duty
was
to
my
mind
equally
so
this
was
either
to
insist
upon
the
adjustment
of
our
claims
within
a
reasonable
period
or
to
abandon
them
altogether
i
could
not
doubt
that
by
this
course
the
interests
and
honor
of
both
countries
would
be
best
consulted
instructions
were
therefore
given
in
this
spirit
to
the
minister
who
was
sent
out
once
more
to
demand
reparation
upon
the
meeting
of
congress
in
december
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
speak
of
these
claims
and
the
delays
of
france
in
terms
calculated
to
call
the
serious
attention
of
both
countries
to
the
subject
the
then
french
ministry
took
exception
to
the
message
on
the
ground
of
its
containing
a
menace
under
it
was
not
agreeable
to
the
french
government
to
negotiate
the
american
minister
of
his
own
accord
refuted
the
construction
which
was
attempted
to
be
put
upon
the
message
and
at
the
same
time
called
to
the
recollection
of
the
french
ministry
that
the
presidents
message
was
a
communication
addressed
not
to
foreign
governments
but
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
which
it
was
enjoined
upon
him
by
the
constitution
to
lay
before
that
body
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
comprehending
its
foreign
as
well
as
its
domestic
relations
and
that
if
in
the
discharge
of
this
duty
he
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
summon
the
attention
of
congress
in
due
time
to
what
might
be
the
possible
consequences
of
existing
difficulties
with
any
foreign
government
he
might
fairly
be
supposed
to
do
so
under
a
sense
of
his
own
government
and
not
from
any
intention
of
holding
a
menace
over
a
foreign
power
the
views
taken
by
him
received
my
approbation
the
french
government
was
satisfied
and
the
negotiation
was
continued
it
terminated
in
the
treaty
of
july
th
recognizing
the
justice
of
our
claims
in
part
and
promising
payment
to
the
amount
of
francs
in
six
annual
installments
the
ratifications
of
this
treaty
were
exchanged
at
washington
on
the
second
of
february
and
in
five
days
thereafter
it
was
laid
before
congress
who
immediately
passed
the
acts
necessary
on
our
part
to
secure
to
france
the
commercial
advantages
conceded
to
her
in
the
compact
the
treaty
had
previously
been
solemnly
ratified
by
the
king
of
the
french
in
terms
which
are
certainly
not
mere
matters
of
form
and
of
which
the
translation
is
as
follows
we
approving
the
above
convention
in
all
and
each
of
the
dispositions
which
are
contained
in
it
do
declare
by
ourselves
as
well
as
by
our
heirs
and
successors
that
it
is
accepted
approved
ratified
and
confirmed
and
by
these
presents
signed
by
our
hand
we
do
accept
approve
ratify
and
confirm
it
promising
on
the
faith
and
word
of
a
king
to
observe
it
and
to
cause
it
to
be
observed
inviolably
without
ever
contravening
it
or
suffering
it
to
be
contravened
directly
or
indirectly
for
any
cause
or
under
any
pretense
whatsoever
official
information
of
the
exchange
of
ratifications
in
the
united
states
reached
paris
whilst
the
chambers
were
in
session
the
extraordinary
and
to
us
injurious
delays
of
the
french
government
in
their
action
upon
the
subject
of
its
fulfillment
have
been
heretofore
stated
to
congress
and
i
have
no
disposition
to
enlarge
upon
them
here
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
the
then
pending
session
was
allowed
to
expire
without
even
an
effort
to
obtain
the
necessary
appropriations
that
the
two
succeeding
ones
were
also
suffered
to
pass
away
without
anything
like
a
serious
attempt
to
obtain
a
decision
upon
the
subject
and
that
it
was
not
until
the
fourth
session
almost
three
years
after
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
and
more
than
two
years
after
the
exchange
of
ratifications
that
the
bill
for
the
execution
of
the
treaty
was
pressed
to
a
vote
and
rejected
in
the
mean
time
the
government
of
the
united
states
having
full
confidence
that
a
treaty
entered
into
and
so
solemnly
ratified
by
the
french
king
would
be
executed
in
good
faith
and
not
doubting
that
provision
would
be
made
for
the
payment
of
the
first
installment
which
was
to
become
due
on
the
second
day
of
february
negotiated
a
draft
for
the
amount
through
the
bank
of
the
united
states
when
this
draft
was
presented
by
the
holder
with
the
credentials
required
by
the
treaty
to
authorize
him
to
receive
the
money
the
government
of
france
allowed
it
to
be
protested
in
addition
to
the
injury
in
the
nonpayment
of
the
money
by
france
conformably
to
her
engagement
the
united
states
were
exposed
to
a
heavy
claim
on
the
part
of
the
bank
under
pretense
of
damages
in
satisfaction
of
which
that
institution
seized
upon
and
still
retains
an
equal
amount
of
the
public
money
congress
was
in
session
when
the
decision
of
the
chambers
reached
washington
and
an
immediate
communication
of
th
is
apparently
final
decision
of
france
not
to
fulfill
the
stipulation
of
the
treaty
was
the
course
naturally
to
be
expected
from
the
president
the
deep
tone
of
dissatisfaction
which
pervaded
the
public
mind
and
the
correspondent
excitement
produced
in
congress
by
only
a
general
knowledge
of
the
result
rendered
it
more
than
probable
that
a
resort
to
immediate
measures
of
redress
would
be
the
consequence
of
calling
the
attention
of
that
body
to
the
subject
sincerely
desirous
of
preserving
the
pacific
relations
which
had
so
long
existed
between
the
two
countries
i
was
anxious
to
avoid
this
course
if
i
could
be
satisfied
that
by
so
neither
the
interests
nor
the
honor
of
my
country
would
be
compromitted
without
the
fullest
assurances
on
that
point
i
could
not
hope
to
acquit
myself
of
the
responsibility
to
be
incurred
in
suffering
congress
to
adjourn
without
laying
the
subject
before
them
those
received
by
me
were
believed
to
be
of
that
character
that
the
feelings
produced
in
the
united
states
by
the
news
of
the
rejection
of
the
appropriation
would
be
such
as
i
have
described
them
to
have
been
was
foreseen
by
the
french
government
and
prompt
measures
were
taken
by
it
to
prevent
the
consequence
the
king
in
person
expressed
through
our
minister
at
paris
his
profound
regret
at
the
decision
of
the
chambers
and
promised
to
send
forthwith
a
ship
with
dispatches
to
his
minister
here
authorizing
him
to
give
such
assurances
as
would
satisfy
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
that
the
treaty
would
yet
be
faithfully
executed
by
france
the
national
ship
arrived
and
the
minister
received
his
instructions
claiming
to
act
under
the
authority
derived
from
them
he
gave
to
this
government
in
the
name
of
his
the
most
solemn
assurances
that
as
soon
after
the
new
elections
as
the
charter
would
permit
the
french
chambers
would
be
convened
and
the
attempt
to
procure
the
necessary
appropriations
renewed
that
all
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
king
and
his
ministers
should
be
put
in
requisition
to
accomplish
the
object
and
he
was
understood
and
so
expressly
informed
by
this
government
at
the
time
to
engage
that
the
question
should
be
pressed
to
a
decision
at
a
period
sufficiently
early
to
permit
information
of
the
result
to
be
communicated
to
congress
at
the
commencement
of
their
next
session
relying
upon
these
assurances
i
incurred
the
responsibility
great
as
i
regarded
it
to
be
of
suffering
congress
to
separate
without
communicating
with
them
upon
the
subject
the
expectations
justly
founded
upon
the
promises
thus
solemnly
made
to
this
government
by
that
of
france
were
not
realized
the
french
chambers
met
on
the
thirtyfirst
of
july
soon
after
the
election
and
although
our
minister
in
paris
urged
the
french
ministry
to
bring
the
subject
before
them
they
declined
doing
so
he
next
insisted
that
the
chambers
of
prorogued
without
acting
on
the
subject
should
be
reassembled
at
a
period
so
early
that
their
action
on
the
treaty
might
be
known
in
washington
prior
to
the
meeting
of
congress
this
reasonable
request
was
not
only
declined
but
the
chambers
were
prorogued
to
the
th
of
december
a
day
so
late
that
their
decision
however
urgently
pressed
could
not
in
all
probability
be
obtained
in
time
to
reach
washington
before
the
necessary
adjournment
of
congress
by
the
constitution
the
reasons
given
by
the
ministry
for
refusing
to
convoke
the
chambers
at
an
earlier
period
were
afterwards
shewn
not
to
be
insuperable
by
their
actual
convocation
on
the
first
of
december
under
a
special
call
for
domestic
purposes
which
fact
however
did
not
become
known
to
this
government
until
after
the
commencement
of
the
last
session
of
congress
thus
disappointed
in
our
just
expectations
it
became
my
imperative
duty
to
consult
with
congress
in
regard
to
the
expediency
of
a
resort
to
retaliatory
measures
in
case
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
should
not
be
speedily
complied
with
and
to
recommend
such
as
in
my
judgment
the
occasion
called
for
to
this
end
an
unreserved
communication
of
the
case
in
all
its
aspects
became
indispensable
to
have
shrunk
in
making
it
from
saying
all
that
was
necessary
to
its
correct
understanding
and
that
the
truth
would
justify
for
fear
of
giving
offense
to
others
would
have
been
unworthy
of
us
to
have
gone
on
the
other
hand
a
single
step
further
for
the
purpose
of
wounding
the
pride
of
a
government
and
people
with
whom
we
had
so
many
motives
for
cultivating
relations
of
amity
and
reciprocal
advantage
would
have
been
unwise
and
improper
admonished
by
the
past
of
the
difficulty
of
making
even
the
simplest
statement
of
our
wrongs
without
disturbing
the
sensibilities
of
those
who
had
by
their
position
become
responsible
for
their
redress
and
earnestly
desirous
of
preventing
further
obstacles
from
that
source
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
preclude
a
construction
of
the
message
by
which
the
recommendation
that
was
made
to
congress
might
be
regarded
as
a
menace
to
france
in
not
only
disavowing
such
a
design
but
in
declaring
that
her
pride
and
her
power
were
too
well
known
to
expect
anything
from
her
fears
the
message
did
not
reach
paris
until
more
than
a
month
after
the
chambers
had
been
in
session
and
such
was
the
insensibility
of
the
ministry
to
our
rightful
claims
and
just
expectations
that
our
minister
had
been
informed
that
the
matter
when
introduced
would
not
be
pressed
as
a
cabinet
measure
although
the
message
was
not
officially
communicated
to
the
french
government
and
not
withstanding
the
declaration
to
the
contrary
which
it
contained
the
french
ministry
decided
to
consider
the
conditional
recommendation
of
reprisals
a
menace
and
an
insult
which
the
honor
of
the
nation
made
it
incumbent
on
them
to
resent
the
measures
resorted
to
by
them
to
evince
their
sense
of
the
supposed
indignity
were
the
immediate
recall
of
their
minister
at
washington
the
offer
of
passports
to
the
american
minister
at
paris
and
a
public
notice
to
the
legislative
chambers
that
all
diplomatic
intercourse
with
the
united
states
had
been
suspended
having
in
this
manner
vindicated
the
dignity
of
france
they
next
proceeded
to
illustrate
her
justice
to
this
end
a
bill
was
immediately
introduced
into
the
chamber
of
deputies
proposing
to
make
the
appropriations
necessary
to
carry
into
effect
the
treaty
as
this
bill
subsequently
passed
into
a
law
the
provisions
of
which
now
constitute
the
main
subject
of
difficulty
between
the
two
nations
it
becomes
my
duty
in
order
to
place
the
subject
before
you
in
a
clear
light
to
trace
the
history
of
its
passage
and
to
refer
with
some
particularity
to
the
proceedings
and
discussions
in
regard
to
it
the
minister
of
finance
in
his
opening
speech
alluded
to
the
measures
which
had
been
adopted
to
resent
the
supposed
indignity
and
recommended
the
execution
of
the
treaty
as
a
measure
required
by
the
honor
and
justice
of
france
he
as
the
organ
of
the
ministry
declared
the
message
so
long
as
it
had
not
received
the
sanction
of
congress
a
mere
expression
of
the
personal
opinion
of
the
president
for
which
neither
the
government
nor
people
of
the
united
states
were
responsible
and
that
an
engagement
had
been
entered
into
for
the
fulfillment
of
which
the
honor
of
france
was
pledged
entertaining
these
views
the
single
condition
which
the
french
ministry
proposed
to
annex
to
the
payment
of
the
money
was
that
it
should
not
be
made
until
it
was
ascertained
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
done
nothing
to
injure
the
interests
of
france
or
in
other
words
that
no
steps
had
been
authorized
by
congress
of
a
hostile
character
toward
france
what
the
disposition
of
action
of
congress
might
be
was
then
unknown
to
the
french
cabinet
but
on
the
th
day
of
january
the
senate
resolved
that
it
was
at
that
time
inexpedient
to
adopt
any
legislative
measures
in
regard
to
the
state
of
affairs
between
the
united
states
and
france
and
no
action
on
the
subject
had
occurred
in
the
house
of
representatives
these
facts
were
known
in
paris
prior
to
the
th
of
march
when
the
committee
to
whom
the
bill
of
indemnification
had
been
referred
reported
it
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
that
committee
substantially
reechoed
the
sentiments
of
the
ministry
declared
that
congress
had
set
aside
the
proposition
of
the
president
and
recommended
the
passage
of
the
bill
without
any
other
restriction
than
that
originally
proposed
thus
was
it
known
to
the
french
ministry
and
chambers
that
if
the
position
assumed
by
them
and
which
had
been
so
frequently
and
solemnly
announced
as
the
only
one
compatible
with
the
honor
of
france
was
maintained
and
the
bill
passed
as
originally
proposed
the
money
would
be
paid
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
this
unfortunate
controversy
but
this
cheering
prospect
was
soon
destroyed
by
an
amendment
introduced
into
the
bill
at
the
moment
of
its
passage
providing
that
the
money
should
not
be
paid
until
the
french
government
had
received
satisfactory
explanations
of
the
presidents
message
of
the
second
december
and
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
the
president
of
the
council
of
ministers
adopted
this
amendment
and
consented
to
its
incorporation
in
the
bill
in
regard
to
a
supposed
insult
which
had
been
formally
resented
by
the
recall
of
their
minister
and
the
offer
of
passports
to
ours
they
now
for
the
first
time
proposed
to
ask
explanations
sentiments
and
propositions
which
they
had
declared
could
not
justly
be
imputed
to
the
government
or
people
of
the
united
states
are
set
up
as
obstacles
to
the
performance
of
an
act
of
conceded
justice
to
that
government
and
people
they
had
declared
that
the
honor
of
france
required
the
fulfillment
of
the
engagement
into
which
the
king
had
entered
unless
congress
adopted
the
recommendations
of
the
message
they
ascertained
that
congress
did
not
adopt
them
and
yet
that
fulfillment
is
refused
unless
they
first
obtain
from
the
president
explanations
of
an
opinion
characterized
by
themselves
as
personal
and
inoperative
the
conception
that
it
was
my
intention
to
menace
or
insult
the
government
of
france
is
as
unfounded
as
the
attem
pt
to
extort
from
the
fears
of
that
nation
what
her
sense
of
justice
may
deny
would
be
vain
and
ridiculous
but
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
imposes
on
the
president
the
duty
of
laying
before
congress
the
condition
of
the
country
in
its
foreign
and
domestic
relations
and
of
recommending
such
measures
as
may
in
his
opinion
be
required
by
its
interests
from
the
performance
of
this
duty
he
can
not
be
deterred
by
the
fear
of
wounding
the
sensibilities
of
the
people
or
government
of
whom
it
may
become
necessary
to
speak
and
the
american
people
are
incapable
of
submitting
to
an
interference
by
any
government
on
earth
however
powerful
with
the
free
performance
of
the
domestic
duties
which
the
constitution
has
imposed
on
their
public
functionaries
the
discussions
which
intervene
between
the
several
departments
of
our
government
being
to
ourselves
and
for
anything
said
in
them
our
public
servants
are
only
responsible
to
their
own
constituents
and
to
each
other
if
in
the
course
of
their
consultations
facts
are
erroneously
stated
or
unjust
deductions
are
made
they
require
no
other
inducement
to
correct
them
however
informed
of
their
error
than
their
love
of
justice
and
what
is
due
to
their
own
character
but
they
can
never
submit
to
be
interrogated
upon
the
subject
as
a
matter
of
right
by
a
foreign
power
when
our
discussions
terminate
in
acts
our
responsibility
to
foreign
powers
commences
not
as
individuals
but
as
a
nation
the
principle
which
calls
in
question
the
president
for
the
language
of
his
message
would
equally
justify
a
foreign
power
in
demanding
explanations
of
the
language
used
in
the
report
of
a
committee
or
by
a
member
in
debate
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
government
of
france
has
taken
exception
to
the
messages
of
american
presidents
president
washington
and
the
first
president
adams
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
to
the
american
people
fell
under
the
animadversions
of
the
french
directory
the
objection
taken
by
the
ministry
of
charles
x
and
removed
by
the
explanation
made
by
our
minister
upon
the
spot
has
already
been
adverted
to
when
it
was
understood
that
the
ministry
of
the
present
king
took
exception
to
my
message
of
last
year
putting
a
construction
upon
it
which
was
disavowed
on
its
face
our
late
minister
at
paris
in
answer
to
the
note
which
first
announced
a
dissatisfaction
with
the
language
used
in
the
message
made
a
communication
to
the
french
government
under
date
of
the
th
of
january
calculated
to
remove
all
impressions
which
an
unreasonable
susceptibility
had
created
he
repeated
and
called
the
attention
of
the
french
government
to
the
disavowal
contained
in
the
message
itself
of
any
intention
to
intimidate
by
menace
he
truly
declared
that
it
contained
and
was
intended
to
contain
no
charge
of
ill
faith
against
the
king
of
the
french
and
properly
distinguished
between
the
right
to
complain
in
unexceptionable
terms
of
the
omission
to
execute
an
agreement
and
an
accusation
of
bad
motives
in
withholding
such
execution
and
demonstrated
that
the
necessary
use
of
that
right
ought
not
to
be
considered
as
an
offensive
imputation
although
this
communication
was
made
without
instructions
and
entirely
on
the
ministers
own
responsibility
yet
it
was
afterwards
made
the
act
of
this
government
by
my
full
approbation
and
that
approbation
was
officially
made
known
on
the
th
of
april
to
the
french
government
it
however
failed
to
have
any
effect
the
law
after
this
friendly
explanation
passed
with
the
obnoxious
amendment
supported
by
the
kings
ministers
and
was
finally
approved
by
the
king
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
justly
attached
to
a
pacific
system
in
their
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
it
is
proper
therefore
that
they
should
know
whether
their
government
has
adhered
to
it
in
the
present
instance
it
has
been
carried
to
the
utmost
extent
that
was
consistent
with
a
becoming
selfrespect
the
note
of
the
th
of
january
to
which
i
have
before
alluded
was
not
the
only
one
which
our
minister
took
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
presenting
on
the
same
subject
and
in
the
same
spirit
finding
that
it
was
intended
to
make
the
payment
of
a
just
debt
dependent
on
the
performance
of
a
condition
which
he
knew
could
never
be
complied
with
he
thought
it
a
duty
to
make
another
attempt
to
convince
the
french
government
that
whilst
selfrespect
and
regard
to
the
dignity
of
other
nations
would
always
prevent
us
from
using
any
language
that
ought
to
give
offense
yet
we
could
never
admit
a
right
in
any
foreign
government
to
ask
explanations
of
or
to
interfere
in
any
manner
in
the
communications
which
one
branch
of
our
public
councils
made
with
another
that
in
the
present
case
no
such
language
had
been
used
and
that
this
had
in
a
former
note
been
fully
and
voluntarily
state
before
it
was
contemplated
to
make
the
explanation
a
condition
and
that
there
might
be
no
misapprehension
he
stated
the
terms
used
in
that
note
and
he
officially
informed
them
that
it
had
been
approved
by
the
president
and
that
therefore
every
explanation
which
could
reasonably
be
asked
or
honorably
given
had
been
already
made
that
the
contemplated
measure
had
been
anticipated
by
a
voluntary
and
friendly
declaration
and
was
therefore
not
only
useless
but
might
be
deemed
offensive
and
certainly
would
not
be
complied
with
if
annexed
as
a
condition
when
this
latter
communication
to
which
i
especially
invite
the
attention
of
congress
was
laid
before
me
i
entertained
the
hope
that
the
means
it
was
obviously
intended
to
afford
of
an
honorable
and
speedy
adjustment
of
the
difficulties
between
the
two
nations
would
have
been
accepted
and
i
therefore
did
not
hesitate
to
give
it
my
sanction
and
full
approbation
this
was
due
to
the
minister
who
had
made
himself
responsible
for
the
act
and
it
was
published
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
is
now
laid
before
their
representatives
to
shew
how
far
their
executive
has
gone
in
its
endeavors
to
restore
a
good
understanding
between
the
two
countries
it
would
have
been
at
any
time
communicated
to
the
government
of
france
had
it
been
officially
requested
the
french
government
having
received
all
the
explanation
which
honor
and
principle
permitted
and
which
could
in
reason
be
asked
it
was
hoped
it
would
no
longer
hesitate
to
pay
the
installments
now
due
the
agent
authorized
to
receive
the
money
was
instructed
to
inform
the
french
minister
of
his
readiness
to
do
so
in
reply
to
this
notice
he
was
told
that
the
money
could
not
then
be
paid
because
the
formalities
required
by
the
act
of
the
chambers
had
not
been
arranged
not
having
received
any
official
information
of
the
intentions
of
the
french
government
and
anxious
to
bring
as
far
as
practicable
this
unpleasant
affair
to
a
close
before
the
meeting
of
congress
that
you
might
have
the
whole
subject
before
you
i
caused
our
charge
daffaires
at
paris
to
be
instructed
to
ask
for
the
final
determination
of
the
french
government
and
in
the
event
of
their
refusal
to
pay
the
installments
now
due
without
further
explanations
to
return
to
the
united
states
the
result
of
this
last
application
has
not
yet
reached
us
but
is
daily
expected
that
it
may
be
favorable
is
my
sincere
wish
france
having
now
through
all
the
branches
of
her
government
acknowledged
the
validity
of
our
claims
and
the
obligation
of
the
treaty
of
and
there
really
existing
no
adequate
cause
for
further
delay
will
at
length
it
may
be
hoped
adopt
the
course
which
the
interests
of
both
nations
not
less
than
the
principles
of
justice
so
imperiously
require
the
treaty
being
once
executed
on
her
part
little
will
remain
to
disturb
the
friendly
relations
of
the
two
countriesnothing
indeed
which
will
not
yield
to
the
suggestions
of
a
pacific
and
enlightened
policy
and
to
the
influence
of
that
mutual
good
will
and
of
those
generous
recollections
which
we
may
confidently
expect
will
then
be
revived
in
all
their
ancient
force
in
any
event
however
the
principle
involved
in
the
new
aspect
which
has
been
given
to
the
controversy
is
so
vitally
important
to
the
independent
administration
of
the
government
that
it
can
neither
be
surrendered
nor
compromitted
without
national
degradation
i
hope
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
such
a
sacrifice
will
not
be
made
through
any
agency
of
mine
the
honor
of
my
country
shall
never
be
stained
by
an
apology
from
me
for
the
statement
of
truth
and
the
performance
of
duty
nor
can
i
give
any
explanation
of
my
official
acts
except
such
as
is
due
to
integrity
and
justice
and
consistent
with
the
principles
on
which
our
institutions
have
been
framed
this
determination
will
i
am
confident
be
approved
by
my
constituents
i
have
indeed
studied
their
character
to
but
little
purpose
if
the
sum
of
francs
will
have
the
weight
of
a
feather
in
the
estimation
of
what
appertains
to
their
national
independence
and
if
unhappily
a
different
impression
should
at
any
time
obtain
in
any
quarter
they
will
i
am
sure
rally
round
the
government
of
their
choice
with
alacrity
and
unanimity
and
silence
for
ever
the
degrading
imputation
having
thus
frankly
presented
to
you
the
circumstances
which
since
the
last
session
of
congress
have
occurred
in
this
interesting
and
important
matter
with
the
views
of
the
executive
in
regard
to
them
it
is
at
this
time
only
necessary
to
add
that
when
ever
the
advices
now
daily
expected
from
our
charge
daffaires
shall
have
been
received
they
will
be
made
the
subject
of
a
special
communication
the
condition
of
the
public
finances
was
never
more
flattering
than
at
the
present
period
since
my
last
annual
communication
all
the
remains
of
the
public
debt
have
been
redeemed
or
money
has
been
placed
in
deposit
for
this
purpose
when
ever
the
creditors
choose
to
receive
it
all
the
other
pecuniary
engagements
of
the
government
have
been
honorably
and
promptly
fulfilled
and
there
will
be
a
balance
in
the
treasury
at
the
close
of
the
year
of
about
it
is
believed
that
after
meeting
all
outstanding
and
unexpended
appropriations
there
will
remain
near
to
be
applied
to
any
new
objects
which

congress
may
designate
or
to
the
more
rapid
execution
of
the
works
already
in
progress
in
aid
of
these
objects
and
to
satisfy
the
current
expenditures
of
the
ensuing
year
it
is
estimated
that
there
will
be
received
from
various
sources
more
in
should
congress
make
new
appropriations
in
conformity
with
the
estimates
which
will
be
submitted
from
the
proper
departments
amounting
to
about
still
the
available
surplus
at
the
close
of
the
next
year
after
deducting
all
unexpended
appropriations
will
probably
not
be
less
than
this
sum
can
in
my
judgment
be
now
usefully
applied
to
proposed
improvements
in
our
navy
yards
and
to
new
national
works
which
are
not
enumerated
in
the
present
estimates
or
to
the
more
rapid
completion
of
those
already
begun
either
would
be
constitutional
and
useful
and
would
render
unnecessary
any
attempt
in
our
present
peculiar
condition
to
divide
the
surplus
revenue
or
to
reduce
it
any
faster
than
will
be
effected
by
the
existing
laws
in
any
event
as
the
annual
report
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
enter
into
details
shewing
the
probability
of
some
decrease
in
the
revenue
during
the
next
seven
years
and
a
very
considerable
deduction
in
it
is
not
recommended
that
congress
should
undertake
to
modify
the
present
tariff
so
as
to
disturb
the
principles
on
which
the
compromise
act
was
passed
taxation
on
some
of
the
articles
of
general
consumption
which
are
not
in
competition
with
our
own
productions
may
be
no
doubt
so
diminished
as
to
lessen
to
some
extent
the
source
of
this
revenue
and
the
same
object
can
also
be
assisted
by
more
liberal
provisions
for
the
subjects
of
public
defense
which
in
the
present
state
of
our
prosperity
and
wealth
may
be
expected
to
engage
your
attention
if
however
after
satisfying
all
the
demands
which
can
arise
from
these
sources
the
unexpended
balance
in
the
treasury
should
still
continue
to
increase
it
would
be
better
to
bear
with
the
evil
until
the
great
changes
contemplated
in
our
tariff
laws
have
occurred
and
shall
enable
us
to
revise
the
system
with
that
care
and
circumspection
which
are
due
to
so
delicate
and
important
a
subject
it
is
certainly
our
duty
to
diminish
as
far
as
we
can
the
burdens
of
taxation
and
to
regard
all
the
restrictions
which
are
imposed
on
the
trade
and
navigation
of
our
citizens
as
evils
which
we
shall
mitigate
when
ever
we
are
not
prevented
by
the
adverse
legislation
and
policy
of
foreign
nations
or
those
primary
duties
which
the
defense
and
independence
of
our
country
enjoin
upon
us
that
we
have
accomplished
much
toward
the
relief
of
our
citizens
by
the
changes
which
have
accompanied
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
and
the
adoption
of
the
present
revenue
laws
is
manifest
from
the
fact
that
compared
to
there
is
a
diminution
of
near
in
the
last
two
years
and
that
our
expenditures
independently
of
those
for
the
public
debt
have
been
reduced
near
during
the
same
period
let
us
trust
that
by
the
continued
observance
of
economy
and
by
harmonizing
the
great
interests
of
agriculture
manufactures
and
commerce
much
more
may
be
accomplished
to
diminish
the
burdens
of
government
and
to
increase
still
further
the
enterprise
and
the
patriotic
affection
of
all
classes
of
our
citizens
and
all
the
members
of
our
happy
confederacy
as
the
data
which
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
lay
before
you
in
regard
to
our
financial
resources
are
full
and
extended
and
will
afford
a
safe
guide
in
your
future
calculations
i
think
it
unnecessary
to
offer
any
further
observations
on
that
subject
here
among
the
evidences
of
the
increasing
prosperity
of
the
country
not
the
least
gratifying
is
that
afforded
by
the
receipts
from
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
which
amount
in
the
present
year
to
the
unexpected
sum
of
this
circumstance
attests
the
rapidity
with
which
agriculture
the
first
and
most
important
occupation
of
man
advances
and
contributes
to
the
wealth
and
power
of
our
extended
territory
being
still
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
our
best
policy
as
far
as
we
can
consistently
with
the
obligations
under
which
those
lands
were
ceded
to
the
united
states
to
promote
their
speedy
settlement
i
beg
leave
to
call
the
attention
of
the
present
congress
to
the
suggestions
i
have
offered
respecting
it
in
my
former
messages
the
extraordinary
receipts
from
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
invite
you
to
consider
what
improvements
the
land
system
and
particularly
the
condition
of
the
general
land
office
may
require
at
the
time
this
institution
was
organized
near
a
quarter
century
ago
it
would
probably
have
been
thought
extravagant
to
anticipate
for
this
period
such
an
addition
to
its
business
as
has
been
produced
by
the
vast
increase
of
those
sales
during
the
past
and
present
years
it
may
also
be
observed
that
since
the
year
the
land
offices
and
surveying
districts
have
been
greatly
multiplied
and
that
numerous
legislative
enactments
from
year
to
year
since
that
time
have
imposed
a
great
amount
of
new
and
additional
duties
upon
that
office
while
the
want
of
a
timely
application
of
force
commensurate
with
the
care
and
labor
required
has
caused
the
increasing
embarrassment
of
accumulated
arrears
in
the
different
branches
of
the
establishment
these
impediments
to
the
expedition
of
much
duty
in
the
general
land
office
induce
me
to
submit
to
your
judgment
whether
some
modification
of
the
laws
relating
to
its
organization
or
an
organization
of
a
new
character
be
not
called
for
at
the
present
juncture
to
enable
the
office
to
accomplish
all
the
ends
of
its
institution
with
a
greater
degree
of
facility
and
promptitude
than
experience
has
proved
to
be
practicable
under
existing
regulations
the
variety
of
the
concerns
and
the
magnitude
and
complexity
of
the
details
occupying
and
dividing
the
attention
of
the
commissioner
appear
to
render
it
difficult
if
not
impracticable
for
that
officer
by
any
possible
assiduity
to
bestow
on
all
the
multifarious
subjects
upon
which
he
is
called
to
act
the
ready
and
careful
attention
due
to
their
respective
importance
unless
the
legislature
shall
assist
him
by
a
law
providing
or
enabling
him
to
provide
for
a
more
regular
and
economical
distribution
of
labor
with
the
incident
responsibility
among
those
employed
under
his
direction
the
mere
manual
operation
of
affixing
his
signature
to
the
vast
number
of
documents
issuing
from
his
office
subtracts
so
largely
from
the
time
and
attention
claimed
by
the
weighty
and
complicated
subjects
daily
accumulating
in
that
branch
of
the
public
service
as
to
indicate
the
strong
necessity
of
revising
the
organic
law
of
the
establishment
it
will
be
easy
for
congress
hereafter
to
proportion
the
expenditure
on
account
of
this
branch
of
the
service
to
its
real
wants
by
abolishing
from
time
to
time
the
offices
which
can
be
dispensed
with
the
extinction
of
the
public
debt
having
taken
place
there
is
no
longer
any
use
for
the
offices
of
commissioners
of
loans
and
of
the
sinking
fund
i
recommend
therefore
that
they
be
abolished
and
that
proper
measures
be
taken
for
the
transfer
to
the
treasury
department
of
any
funds
books
and
papers
connected
with
the
operations
of
those
offices
and
that
the
proper
power
be
given
to
that
department
for
closing
finally
any
portion
of
their
business
which
may
remain
to
be
settled
it
is
also
incumbent
on
congress
in
guarding
the
pecuniary
interests
of
the
country
to
discontinue
by
such
a
law
as
was
passed
in
the
receipt
of
the
bills
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
in
payment
of
the
public
revenue
and
to
provide
for
the
designation
of
an
agent
whose
duty
it
shall
be
to
take
charge
of
the
books
and
stock
of
the
united
states
in
that
institution
and
to
close
all
connection
with
it
after
the
d
of
march
when
its
charter
expires
in
making
provision
in
regard
to
the
disposition
of
this
stock
it
will
be
essential
to
define
clearly
and
strictly
the
duties
and
powers
of
the
officer
charged
with
that
branch
of
the
public
service
it
will
be
seen
from
the
correspondence
which
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
lay
before
you
that
not
withstanding
the
large
amount
of
the
stock
which
the
united
states
hold
in
that
institution
no
information
has
yet
been
communicated
which
will
enable
the
government
to
anticipate
when
it
can
receive
any
dividends
or
derive
any
benefit
from
it
connected
with
the
condition
of
the
finances
and
the
flourishing
state
of
the
country
in
all
its
branches
of
industry
it
is
pleasing
to
witness
the
advantages
which
have
been
already
derived
from
the
recent
laws
regulating
the
value
of
the
gold
coinage
these
advantages
will
be
more
apparent
in
the
course
of
the
next
year
when
the
branch
mints
authorized
to
be
established
in
north
carolina
georgia
and
louisiana
shall
have
gone
into
operation
aided
as
it
is
hoped
they
will
be
by
further
reforms
in
the
banking
systems
of
the
states
and
by
judicious
regulations
on
the
part
of
congress
in
relation
to
the
custody
of
the
public
moneys
it
may
be
confidently
anticipated
that
the
use
of
gold
and
silver
as
circulating
medium
will
become
general
in
the
ordinary
transactions
connected
with
the
labor
of
the
country
the
great
desideratum
in
modern
times
is
an
efficient
check
upon
the
power
of
banks
preventing
that
excessive
issue
of
paper
whence
arise
those
fluctuations
in
the
standard
of
value
which
render
uncertain
the
rewards
of
labor
it
was
supposed
by
those
who
established
the
bank
of
the
united
states
that
from
the
credit
given
to
it
by
the
custody
of
the
public
moneys
and
other
privileges
and
the
precautions
taken
to
guard
against
the
evils
which
the
country
had
suffered
in
the
bankruptcy
of
many
of
the
state
institutions
of
that
period
we
should
derive
from
that
institution
all
the
security
and
benefits
of
a
sound
currency
and
every
good
end
that
was
attainable
under
the
provision
of
the
constitution
which
authorizes
congress
alone
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
thereof
but
it
is
scarcely
necessary
now
to
say
that
these
anticipations
have
not
been
realized
after
the
extensive
embarrassment
and
distress
recently
produced
by
the
bank
of
the
united
stat
es
from
which
the
country
is
now
recovering
aggravated
as
they
were
by
pretensions
to
power
which
defied
the
public
authority
and
which
if
acquiesced
in
by
the
people
would
have
changed
the
whole
character
of
our
government
every
candid
and
intelligent
individual
must
admit
that
for
the
attainment
of
the
great
advantages
of
a
sound
currency
we
must
look
to
a
course
of
legislation
radically
different
from
that
which
created
such
an
institution
in
considering
the
means
of
obtaining
so
important
an
end
we
must
set
aside
all
calculations
of
temporary
convenience
and
be
influenced
by
those
only
which
are
in
harmony
with
the
true
character
and
the
permanent
interests
of
the
republic
we
must
recur
to
first
principles
and
see
what
it
is
that
has
prevented
the
legislation
of
congress
and
the
states
on
the
subject
of
currency
from
satisfying
the
public
expectation
and
realizing
results
corresponding
to
those
which
have
attended
the
action
of
our
system
when
truly
consistent
with
the
great
principle
of
equality
upon
which
it
rests
and
with
that
spirit
of
forbearance
and
mutual
concession
and
generous
patriotism
which
was
originally
and
must
ever
continue
to
be
the
vital
element
of
our
union
on
this
subject
i
am
sure
that
i
can
not
be
mistaken
in
ascribing
our
want
of
success
to
the
undue
countenance
which
has
been
afforded
to
the
spirit
of
monopoly
all
the
serious
dangers
which
our
system
has
yet
encountered
may
be
traced
to
the
resort
to
implied
powers
and
the
use
of
corporations
clothed
with
privileges
the
effect
of
which
is
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
few
at
the
expense
of
the
many
we
have
felt
but
one
class
of
these
dangers
exhibited
in
the
contest
waged
by
the
bank
of
the
united
states
against
the
government
for
the
last
four
years
happily
they
have
been
obviated
for
the
present
by
the
indignant
resistance
of
the
people
but
we
should
recollect
that
the
principle
whence
they
sprung
is
an
everactive
one
which
will
not
fail
to
renew
its
efforts
in
the
same
and
in
other
forms
so
long
as
there
is
a
hope
of
success
founded
either
on
the
inattention
of
the
people
or
the
treachery
of
their
representatives
to
the
subtle
progress
of
its
influence
the
bank
is
in
fact
but
one
of
the
fruits
of
a
system
at
war
with
the
genius
of
all
our
institutionsa
system
founded
upon
a
political
creed
the
fundamental
principle
of
which
is
a
distrust
of
the
popular
will
as
a
safe
regulator
of
political
power
and
whose
great
ultimate
object
and
inevitable
result
should
it
prevail
is
the
consolidation
of
all
power
in
our
system
in
one
central
government
lavish
public
disbursements
and
corporations
with
exclusive
privileges
would
be
its
substitutes
for
the
original
and
as
yet
sound
checks
and
balances
of
the
constitutionthe
means
by
whose
silent
and
secret
operation
a
control
would
be
exercised
by
the
few
over
the
political
conduct
of
the
many
by
first
acquiring
that
control
over
the
labor
and
earnings
of
the
great
body
of
the
people
wherever
this
spirit
has
effected
an
alliance
with
political
power
tyranny
and
despotism
have
been
the
fruit
if
it
is
ever
used
for
the
ends
of
government
it
has
to
be
incessantly
watched
or
it
corrupts
the
sources
of
the
public
virtue
and
agitates
the
country
with
questions
unfavorable
to
the
harmonious
and
steady
pursuit
of
its
true
interests
we
are
now
to
see
whether
in
the
present
favorable
condition
of
the
country
we
can
not
take
an
effectual
stand
against
the
spirit
of
monopoly
and
practically
prove
in
respect
to
the
currency
as
well
as
other
important
interests
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
so
extensive
a
resort
to
it
as
that
which
has
been
heretofore
practiced
the
experience
of
another
year
has
confirmed
the
utter
fallacy
of
the
idea
that
the
bank
of
the
united
states
was
necessary
as
a
fiscal
agent
of
the
government
without
its
aid
as
such
indeed
in
despite
of
all
the
embarrassment
it
was
in
its
power
to
create
the
revenue
has
been
paid
with
punctuality
by
our
citizens
the
business
of
exchange
both
foreign
and
domestic
has
been
conducted
with
convenience
and
the
circulating
medium
has
been
greatly
improved
by
the
use
of
the
state
banks
which
do
not
derive
their
charters
from
the
general
government
and
are
not
controlled
by
its
authority
it
is
ascertained
that
the
moneys
of
the
united
states
can
be
collected
and
disbursed
without
loss
or
inconvenience
and
that
all
the
wants
of
the
community
in
relation
to
exchange
and
currency
are
supplied
as
well
as
they
have
ever
been
before
if
under
circumstances
the
most
unfavorable
to
the
steadiness
of
the
money
market
it
has
been
found
that
the
considerations
on
which
the
bank
of
the
united
states
rested
its
claims
to
the
public
favor
were
imaginary
and
groundless
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
experience
of
the
future
will
be
more
decisive
against
them
it
has
been
seen
that
without
the
agency
of
a
great
moneyed
monopoly
the
revenue
can
be
collected
and
conveniently
and
safely
applied
to
all
the
purposes
of
the
public
expenditure
it
is
also
ascertained
that
instead
of
being
necessarily
made
to
promote
the
evils
of
an
unchecked
paper
system
the
management
of
the
revenue
can
be
made
auxiliary
to
the
reform
which
the
legislatures
of
several
of
the
states
have
already
commenced
in
regard
to
the
suppression
of
small
bills
and
which
has
only
to
be
fostered
by
proper
regulations
on
the
part
of
congress
to
secure
a
practical
return
to
the
extent
required
for
the
security
of
the
currency
to
the
constitutional
medium
severed
from
the
government
as
political
engines
and
not
susceptible
of
dangerous
extension
and
combination
the
state
banks
will
not
be
tempted
nor
will
they
have
the
power
which
we
have
seen
exercised
to
divert
the
public
funds
from
the
legitimate
purposes
of
the
government
the
collection
and
custody
of
the
revenue
being
on
the
contrary
a
source
of
credit
to
them
will
increase
the
security
which
the
states
provide
for
a
faithful
execution
of
their
trusts
by
multiplying
the
scrutinies
to
which
their
operations
and
accounts
will
be
subjected
thus
disposed
as
well
from
interest
as
the
obligations
of
their
charters
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
such
conditions
as
congress
may
see
fit
to
adopt
respecting
the
deposits
in
these
institutions
with
a
view
to
the
gradual
disuse
of
the
small
bills
will
be
cheerfully
complied
with
and
that
we
shall
soon
gain
in
place
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
a
practical
reform
in
the
whole
paper
system
of
the
country
if
by
this
policy
we
can
ultimately
witness
the
suppression
of
all
bank
bills
below
it
is
apparent
that
gold
and
silver
will
take
their
place
and
become
the
principal
circulating
medium
in
the
common
business
of
the
farmers
and
mechanics
of
the
country
the
attainment
of
such
a
result
will
form
an
era
in
the
history
of
our
country
which
will
be
dwelt
upon
with
delight
by
every
true
friend
of
its
liberty
and
independence
it
will
lighten
the
great
tax
which
our
paper
system
has
so
long
collected
from
the
earnings
of
labor
and
do
more
to
revive
and
perpetuate
those
habits
of
economy
and
simplicity
which
are
so
congenial
to
the
character
of
republicans
than
all
the
legislation
which
has
yet
been
attempted
to
this
subject
i
feel
that
i
can
not
too
earnestly
invite
the
special
attention
of
congress
without
the
exercise
of
whose
authority
the
opportunity
to
accomplish
so
much
public
good
must
pass
unimproved
deeply
impressed
with
its
vital
importance
the
executive
has
taken
all
the
steps
within
his
constitutional
power
to
guard
the
public
revenue
and
defeat
the
expectation
which
the
bank
of
the
united
states
indulged
of
renewing
and
perpetuating
its
monopoly
on
the
ground
of
its
necessity
as
a
fiscal
agent
and
as
affording
a
sounder
currency
than
could
be
obtained
without
such
an
institution
in
the
performance
of
this
duty
much
responsibility
was
incurred
which
would
have
been
gladly
avoided
if
the
stake
which
the
public
had
in
the
question
could
have
been
otherwise
preserved
although
clothed
with
the
legal
authority
and
supported
by
precedent
i
was
aware
that
there
was
in
the
act
of
the
removal
of
the
deposits
a
liability
to
excite
that
sensitiveness
to
executive
power
which
it
is
characteristic
and
the
duty
of
free
men
to
indulge
but
i
relied
on
this
feeling
also
directed
by
patriotism
and
intelligence
to
vindicate
the
conduct
which
in
the
end
would
appear
to
have
been
called
for
by
the
interests
of
my
country
the
apprehensions
natural
to
this
feeling
that
there
may
have
been
a
desire
through
the
instrumentality
of
that
measure
to
extend
the
executive
influence
or
that
it
may
have
been
prompted
by
motives
not
sufficiently
free
from
ambition
were
not
overlooked
under
the
operation
of
our
institutions
the
public
servant
who
is
called
on
to
take
a
step
of
high
responsibility
should
feel
in
the
freedom
which
gives
rise
to
such
apprehensions
his
highest
security
when
unfounded
the
attention
which
they
arouse
and
the
discussions
they
excite
deprive
those
who
indulge
them
of
the
power
to
do
harm
when
just
they
but
hasten
the
certainty
with
which
the
great
body
of
our
citizens
never
fail
to
repel
an
attempt
to
procure
the
sanction
to
any
exercise
of
power
inconsistent
with
the
jealous
maintenance
of
their
rights
under
such
convictions
and
entertaining
no
doubt
that
my
constitutional
obligations
demanded
the
steps
which
were
taken
in
reference
to
the
removal
of
the
deposits
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
be
deterred
from
the
path
of
duty
by
a
fear
that
my
motives
could
be
misjudged
or
that
political
prejudices
could
defeat
the
just
consideration
of
the
merits
of
my
conduct
the
result
has
shewn
how
safe
is
this
reliance
upon
the
patriotic
temper
and
enlightened
discernment
of
the
people
that
measure
has
now
been
before
them
and
has
stood
the
test
of
all
the
severe
analysis
which
its
general
importance
the
interests
it
affected
and
the
apprehensions
it
excited
were
calculated
to
produce
and
it
now
remains
for
congress
to
consider
what
legislation
has
become
necessary
in
consequence
i
need
only
add
to
what
i
have
on
former
occasions
said
on
t
his
subject
generally
that
in
the
regulations
which
congress
may
prescribe
respecting
the
custody
of
the
public
moneys
it
is
desirable
that
as
little
discretion
as
may
be
deemed
consistent
with
their
safekeeping
should
be
given
to
the
executive
agents
no
one
can
be
more
deeply
impressed
than
i
am
with
the
soundness
of
the
doctrine
which
restrains
and
limits
by
specific
provisions
executive
discretion
as
far
as
it
can
be
done
consistently
with
the
preservation
of
its
constitutional
character
in
respect
to
the
control
over
the
public
money
this
doctrine
is
peculiarly
applicable
and
is
in
harmony
with
the
great
principle
which
i
felt
i
was
sustaining
in
the
controversy
with
the
bank
of
the
united
states
which
has
resulted
in
severing
to
some
extent
a
dangerous
connection
between
a
moneyed
and
political
power
the
duty
of
the
legislature
to
define
by
clear
and
positive
enactments
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
action
which
it
belongs
to
the
executive
to
superintend
springs
out
of
a
policy
analogous
to
that
which
enjoins
upon
all
branches
of
the
federal
government
an
abstinence
from
the
exercise
of
powers
not
clearly
granted
in
such
a
government
possessing
only
limited
and
specific
powers
the
spirit
of
its
general
administration
can
not
be
wise
or
just
when
it
opposes
the
reference
of
all
doubtful
points
to
the
great
source
of
authority
the
states
and
the
people
whose
number
and
diversified
relations
securing
them
against
the
influences
and
excitements
which
may
mislead
their
agents
make
them
the
safest
depository
of
power
in
its
application
to
the
executive
with
reference
to
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
the
same
rule
of
action
should
make
the
president
ever
anxious
to
avoid
the
exercise
of
any
discretionary
authority
which
can
be
regulated
by
congress
the
biases
which
may
operate
upon
him
will
not
be
so
likely
to
extend
to
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
that
body
in
my
former
messages
to
congress
i
have
repeatedly
urged
the
propriety
of
lessening
the
discretionary
authority
lodged
in
the
various
departments
but
it
has
produced
no
effect
as
yet
except
the
discontinuance
of
extra
allowances
in
the
army
and
navy
and
the
substitution
of
fixed
salaries
in
the
latter
it
is
believed
that
the
same
principles
could
be
advantageously
applied
in
all
cases
and
would
promote
the
efficiency
and
economy
of
the
public
service
at
the
same
time
that
greater
satisfaction
and
more
equal
justice
would
be
secured
to
the
public
officers
generally
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
will
put
you
in
possession
of
the
operations
of
the
department
confided
to
his
care
in
all
its
diversified
relations
during
the
past
year
i
am
gratified
in
being
able
to
inform
you
that
no
occurrence
has
required
any
movement
of
the
military
force
except
such
as
is
common
to
a
state
of
peace
the
services
of
the
army
have
been
limited
to
their
usual
duties
at
the
various
garrisons
upon
the
atlantic
and
inland
frontier
with
the
exceptions
states
by
the
secretary
of
war
our
small
military
establishment
appears
to
be
adequate
to
the
purposes
for
which
it
is
maintained
and
it
forms
a
nucleus
around
which
any
additional
force
may
be
collected
should
the
public
exigencies
unfortunately
require
any
increase
of
our
military
means

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
performing
my
duty
at
the
opening
of
your
present
session
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
congratulate
you
again
upon
the
prosperous
condition
of
our
beloved
country
divine
providence
has
favored
us
with
general
health
with
rich
rewards
in
the
fields
of
agriculture
and
in
every
branch
of
labor
and
with
peace
to
cultivate
and
extend
the
various
resources
which
employ
the
virtue
and
enterprise
of
our
citizens
let
us
trust
that
in
surveying
a
scene
so
flattering
to
our
free
institutions
our
joint
deliberations
to
preserve
them
may
be
crowned
with
success
our
foreign
relations
continue
with
but
few
exceptions
to
maintain
the
favorable
aspect
which
they
bore
in
my
last
annual
message
and
promise
to
extend
those
advantages
which
the
principles
that
regulate
our
intercourse
with
other
nations
are
so
well
calculated
to
secure
the
question
of
our
north
east
boundary
is
still
pending
with
great
britain
and
the
proposition
made
in
accordance
with
the
resolution
of
the
senate
for
the
establishment
of
a
line
according
to
the
treaty
of
has
not
been
accepted
by
that
government
believing
that
every
disposition
is
felt
on
both
sides
to
adjust
this
perplexing
question
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
the
parties
interested
in
it
the
hope
is
yet
indulged
that
it
may
be
effected
on
the
basis
of
that
proposition
with
the
governments
of
austria
russia
prussia
holland
sweden
and
denmark
the
best
understanding
exists
commerce
with
all
is
fostered
and
protected
by
reciprocal
good
will
under
the
sanction
of
liberal
conventional
or
legal
provisions
in
the
midst
of
her
internal
difficulties
the
queen
of
spain
has
ratified
the
convention
for
the
payment
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
arising
since
it
is
in
the
course
of
execution
on
her
part
and
a
copy
of
it
is
now
laid
before
you
for
such
legislation
as
may
be
found
necessary
to
enable
those
interested
to
derive
the
benefits
of
it
yielding
to
the
force
of
circumstances
and
to
the
wise
counsels
of
time
and
experience
that
power
has
finally
resolved
no
longer
to
occupy
the
unnatural
position
in
which
she
stood
to
the
new
governments
established
in
this
hemisphere
i
have
the
great
satisfaction
of
stating
to
you
that
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
restoration
of
harmony
between
those
who
have
sprung
from
the
same
ancestors
who
are
allied
by
common
interests
profess
the
same
religion
and
speak
the
same
language
the
united
states
have
been
actively
instrumental
our
efforts
to
effect
this
good
work
will
be
persevered
in
while
they
are
deemed
useful
to
the
parties
and
our
entire
disinterestedness
continues
to
be
felt
and
understood
the
act
of
congress
to
countervail
the
discriminating
duties
to
the
prejudice
of
our
navigation
levied
in
cuba
and
puerto
rico
has
been
transmitted
to
the
minister
of
the
united
states
at
madrid
to
be
communicated
to
the
government
of
the
queen
no
intelligence
of
its
receipt
has
yet
reached
the
department
of
state
if
the
present
condition
of
the
country
permits
the
government
to
make
a
careful
and
enlarged
examination
of
the
true
interests
of
these
important
portions
of
its
dominions
no
doubt
is
entertained
that
their
future
intercourse
with
the
united
states
will
be
placed
upon
a
more
just
and
liberal
basis
the
florida
archives
have
not
yet
been
selected
and
delivered
recent
orders
have
been
sent
to
the
agent
of
the
united
states
at
havana
to
return
with
all
that
he
can
obtain
so
that
they
may
be
in
washington
before
the
session
of
the
supreme
court
to
be
used
in
the
legal
questions
there
pending
to
which
the
government
is
a
party
internal
tranquillity
is
happily
restored
to
portugal
the
distracted
state
of
the
country
rendered
unavoidable
the
postponement
of
a
final
payment
of
the
just
claims
of
our
citizens
our
diplomatic
relations
will
be
soon
resumed
and
the
longsubsisting
friendship
with
that
power
affords
the
strongest
guaranty
that
the
balance
due
will
receive
prompt
attention
the
first
installment
due
under
the
convention
of
indemnity
with
the
king
of
the
two
sicilies
has
been
duly
received
and
an
offer
has
been
made
to
extinguish
the
whole
by
a
prompt
paymentan
offer
i
did
not
consider
myself
authorized
to
accept
as
the
indemnification
provided
is
the
exclusive
property
of
individual
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
original
adjustment
of
our
claims
and
the
anxiety
displayed
to
fulfill
at
once
the
stipulations
made
for
the
payment
of
them
are
highly
honorable
to
the
government
of
the
two
sicilies
when
it
is
recollected
that
they
were
the
result
of
the
injustice
of
an
intrusive
power
temporarily
dominant
in
its
territory
a
repugnance
to
acknowledge
and
to
pay
which
would
have
been
neither
unnatural
nor
unexpected
the
circumstances
can
not
fail
to
exalt
its
character
for
justice
and
good
faith
in
the
eyes
of
all
nations
the
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
between
the
united
states
and
belgium
brought
to
your
notice
in
my
last
annual
message
as
sanctioned
by
the
senate
but
the
ratifications
of
which
had
not
been
exchanged
owing
to
a
delay
in
its
reception
at
brussels
and
a
subsequent
absence
of
the
belgian
minister
of
foreign
affairs
has
been
after
mature
deliberation
finally
disavowed
by
that
government
as
inconsistent
with
the
powers
and
instructions
given
to
their
minister
who
negotiated
it
this
disavowal
was
entirely
unexpected
as
the
liberal
principles
embodied
in
the
convention
and
which
form
the
groundwork
of
the
objections
to
it
were
perfectly
satisfactory
to
the
belgian
representative
and
were
supposed
to
be
not
only
within
the
powers
granted
but
expressly
conformable
to
the
instructions
given
to
him
an
offer
not
yet
accepted
has
been
made
by
belgium
to
renew
negotiations
for
a
treaty
less
liberal
in
its
provisions
on
questions
of
general
maritime
law
our
newly
established
relations
with
the
sublime
porte
promise
to
be
useful
to
our
commerce
and
satisfactory
in
every
respect
to
this
government
our
intercourse
with
the
barbary
powers
continues
without
important
change
except
that
the
present
political
state
of
algiers
has
induced
me
to
terminate
the
residence
there
of
a
salaried
consul
and
to
substitute
an
ordinary
consulate
to
remain
so
long
as
the
place
continues
in
the
possession
of
france
our
first
treaty
with
one
of
these
powers
the
emperor
of
morocco
was
formed
in
and
was
limited
to
fifty
years
that
period
has
almost
expired
i
shall
take
measures
to
renew
it
with
the
greater
satisfaction
as
its
stipulations
are
just
and
liberal
and
have
been
with
mutual
fidelity
and
reciprocal
advantage
scrupulously
fulfilled
intestine
dissensions
have
too
frequently
occurred
to
mar
the
prosperity
interrupt
the
commerce
and
distract
the
governments
of
most
of
the
nations
of
this
hemisphere
which
have
separated
themselves
from
spain
when
a
firm
and
permanent
understanding
with
the
parent
country
shall
have
produced
a
formal
acknowledgment
of
their
independence
and
the
idea
of
danger
from
that
quarter
can
be
no
longer
entertained
the
friends
of
freedom
expect
that
those
countries
so
favored
by
nature
will
be
distinguished
for
their
love
of
justice
and
their
devotion
to
those
peaceful
arts
the
assiduous
cultivation
of
which
confers
honor
upon
nations
and
gives
value
to
human
life
in
the
mean
time
i
confidently
hope
that
the
apprehensions
entertained
that
some
of
the
people
of
these
luxuriant
regions
may
be
tempted
in
a
moment
of
unworthy
distrust
of
their
own
capacity
for
the
enjoyment
of
liberty
to
commit
the
too
common
error
of
purchasing
present
repose
by
bestowing
on
some
favorite
leaders
the
fatal
gift
of
irresponsible
power
will
not
be
realized
with
all
these
governments
and
with
that
of
brazil
no
unexpected
changes
in
our
relations
have
occurred
during
the
present
year
frequent
causes
of
just
complaint
have
arisen
upon
the
part
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
some
times
from
the
irregular
action
of
the
constituted
subordinate
authorities
of
the
maritime
regions
and
some
times
from
the
leaders
or
partisans
of
those
in
arms
against
the
established
governments
in
all
cases
representations
have
been
or
will
be
made
and
as
soon
as
their
political
affairs
are
in
a
settled
position
it
is
expected
that
our
friendly
remonstrances
will
be
followed
by
adequate
redress
the
government
of
mexico
made
known
in
december
last
the
appointment
of
commissioners
and
a
surveyor
on
its
part
to
run
in
conjunction
with
ours
the
boundary
line
between
its
territories
and
the
united
states
and
excused
the
delay
for
the
reasons
anticipatedthe
prevalence
of
civil
war
the
commissioners
and
surveyors
not
having
met
within
the
time
stipulated
by
the
treaty
a
new
arrangement
became
necessary
and
our
charge
daffaires
was
instructed
in
january
to
negotiate
in
mexico
an
article
additional
to
the
preexisting
treaty
this
instruction
was
acknowledged
and
no
difficulty
was
apprehended
in
the
accomplishment
of
that
object
by
information
just
received
that
additional
article
to
the
treaty
will
be
obtained
and
transmitted
to
this
country
as
soon
as
it
can
receive
the
ratification
of
the
mexican
congress
the
reunion
of
the
three
states
of
new
grenada
venezuela
and
equador
forming
the
republic
of
colombia
seems
every
day
to
become
more
improbable
the
commissioners
of
the
two
first
are
understood
to
be
now
negotiating
a
just
division
of
the
obligations
contracted
by
them
when
united
under
one
government
the
civil
war
in
equador
it
is
believed
has
prevented
even
the
appointment
of
a
commissioner
on
its
part
i
propose
at
an
early
day
to
submit
in
the
proper
form
the
appointment
of
a
diplomatic
agent
to
venezuela
the
importance
of
the
commerce
of
that
country
to
the
united
states
and
the
large
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
the
government
arising
before
and
since
the
division
of
colombia
rendering
it
in
my
judgment
improper
longer
to
delay
this
step
our
representatives
to
central
america
peru
and
brazil
are
either
at
or
on
their
way
to
their
respective
posts
from
the
argentine
republic
from
which
a
minister
was
expected
to
this
government
nothing
further
h
as
been
heard
occasion
has
been
taken
on
the
departure
of
a
new
consul
to
buenos
ayres
to
remind
that
government
that
its
long
delayed
minister
whose
appointment
had
been
made
known
to
us
had
not
arrived
it
becomes
my
unpleasant
duty
to
inform
you
that
this
pacific
and
highly
gratifying
picture
of
our
foreign
relations
does
not
include
those
with
france
at
this
time
it
is
not
possible
that
any
government
and
people
could
be
more
sincerely
desirous
of
conciliating
a
just
and
friendly
intercourse
with
another
nation
than
are
those
of
the
united
states
with
their
ancient
ally
and
friend
this
disposition
is
founded
as
well
on
the
most
grateful
and
honorable
recollections
associated
with
our
struggle
for
independence
as
upon
a
well
grounded
conviction
that
it
is
consonant
with
the
true
policy
of
both
the
people
of
the
united
states
could
not
therefore
see
without
the
deepest
regret
even
a
temporary
interruption
of
the
friendly
relations
between
the
two
countriesa
regret
which
would
i
am
sure
be
greatly
aggravated
if
there
should
turn
out
to
be
any
reasonable
ground
for
attributing
such
a
result
to
any
act
of
omission
or
commission
on
our
part
i
derive
therefore
the
highest
satisfaction
from
being
able
to
assure
you
that
the
whole
course
of
this
government
has
been
characterized
by
a
spirit
so
conciliatory
and
for
bearing
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
our
justice
and
moderation
should
be
questioned
what
ever
may
be
the
consequences
of
a
longer
perseverance
on
the
part
of
the
french
government
in
her
omission
to
satisfy
the
conceded
claims
of
our
citizens
the
history
of
the
accumulated
and
unprovoked
aggressions
upon
our
commerce
committed
by
authority
of
the
existing
governments
of
france
between
the
years
and
has
been
rendered
too
painfully
familiar
to
americans
to
make
its
repetition
either
necessary
or
desirable
it
will
be
sufficient
here
to
remark
that
there
has
for
many
years
been
scarcely
a
single
administration
of
the
french
government
by
whom
the
justice
and
legality
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
to
indemnity
were
not
to
a
very
considerable
extent
admitted
and
yet
near
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
been
wasted
in
ineffectual
negotiations
to
secure
it
deeply
sensible
of
the
injurious
effects
resulting
from
this
state
of
things
upon
the
interests
and
character
of
both
nations
i
regarded
it
as
among
my
first
duties
to
cause
one
more
effort
to
be
made
to
satisfy
france
that
a
just
and
liberal
settlement
of
our
claims
was
as
well
due
to
her
own
honor
as
to
their
incontestable
validity
the
negotiation
for
this
purpose
was
commenced
with
the
late
government
of
france
and
was
prosecuted
with
such
success
as
to
leave
no
reasonable
ground
to
doubt
that
a
settlement
of
a
character
quite
as
liberal
as
that
which
was
subsequently
made
would
have
been
effected
had
not
the
revolution
by
which
the
negotiation
was
cut
off
taken
place
the
discussions
were
resumed
with
the
present
government
and
the
result
showed
that
we
were
not
wrong
in
supposing
that
an
event
by
which
the
two
governments
were
made
to
approach
each
other
so
much
nearer
in
their
political
principles
and
by
which
the
motives
for
the
most
liberal
and
friendly
intercourse
were
so
greatly
multiplied
could
exercise
no
other
than
a
salutary
influence
upon
the
negotiation
after
the
most
deliberate
and
thorough
examination
of
the
whole
subject
a
treaty
between
the
two
governments
was
concluded
and
signed
at
paris
on
july
th
by
which
it
was
stipulated
that
the
french
government
in
order
to
liberate
itself
from
all
the
reclamations
preferred
against
it
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
unlawful
seizures
captures
sequestrations
confiscations
or
destruction
of
their
vessels
cargoes
or
other
property
engages
to
pay
a
sum
of
francs
to
the
united
states
who
shall
distribute
it
among
those
entitled
in
the
manner
and
according
to
the
rules
it
shall
determine
and
it
was
also
stipulated
on
the
part
of
the
french
government
that
this
francs
should
be
paid
at
paris
in
six
annual
installments
of
francs
and
centimes
each
into
the

new
tariff
in
consideration
of
this
stipulation
which
shall
be
binding
on
the

ten
years
the
french
government
abandons
the
reclamations
which
it
had
formed
in

th
article

this
treaty
was
duly
ratified
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
constitutions
of
both
countries
and
the
ratification
was
exchanged
at
the
city
of
washington
on
february
d
on
account
of
its
commercial
stipulations
it
was
in
five
days
thereafter
laid
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
proceeded
to
enact
such
laws
favorable
to
the
commerce
of
france
as
were
necessary
to
carry
it
into
full
execution
and
france
has
from
that
period
to
the
present
been
in
the
unrestricted
enjoyment
of
the
valuable
privileges
that
were
thus
secured
to
her
the
faith
of
the
french
nation
having
been
thus
solemnly
pledged
through
its
constitutional
organ
for
the
liquidation
and
ultimate
payment
of
the
long
deferred
claims
of
our
citizens
as
also
for
the
adjustment
of
other
points
of
great
and
reciprocal
benefits
to
both
countries
and
the
united
states
having
with
a
fidelity
and
promptitude
by
which
their
conduct
will
i
trust
be
always
characterized
done
every
thing
that
was
necessary
to
carry
the
treaty
into
full
and
fair
effect
on
their
part
counted
with
the
most
perfect
confidence
on
equal
fidelity
and
promptitude
on
the
part
of
the
french
government
in
this
reasonable
expectation
we
have
been
i
regret
to
inform
you
wholly
disappointed
no
legislative
provision
has
been
made
by
france
for
the
execution
of
the
treaty
either
as
it
respects
the
indemnity
to
be
paid
or
the
commercial
benefits
to
be
secured
to
the
united
states
and
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
that
power
in
consequence
thereof
are
placed
in
a
situation
threatening
to
interrupt
the
good
understanding
which
has
so
long
and
so
happily
existed
between
the
two
nations
not
only
has
the
french
government
been
thus
wanting
in
the
performance
of
the
stipulations
it
has
so
solemnly
entered
into
with
the
united
states
but
its
omissions
have
been
marked
by
circumstances
which
would
seem
to
leave
us
without
satisfactory
evidences
that
such
performance
will
certainly
take
place
at
a
future
period
advice
of
the
exchange
of
ratifications
reached
paris
prior
to
april
th
the
french
chambers
were
then
sitting
and
continued
in
session
until
april
st
and
although
one
installment
of
the
indemnity
was
payable
on
february
d
one
year
after
the
exchange
of
ratifications
no
application
was
made
to
the
chambers
for
the
required
appropriation
and
in
consequence
of
no
appropriation
having
then
been
made
the
draft
of
the
united
states
government
for
that
installment
was
dishonored
by
the
minister
of
finance
and
the
united
states
thereby
involved
in
much
controversy
the
next
session
of
the
chambers
commenced
on
november
th
and
continued
until
april
th
not
withstanding
the
omission
to
pay
the
first
installment
had
been
made
the
subject
of
earnest
remonstrance
on
our
part
the
treaty
with
the
united
states
and
a
bill
making
the
necessary
appropriations
to
execute
it
were
not
laid
before
the
chamber
of
deputies
until
april
th
nearly
five
months
after
its
meeting
and
only
nineteen
days
before
the
close
of
the
session
the
bill
was
read
and
referred
to
a
committee
but
there
was
no
further
action
upon
it
the
next
session
of
the
chambers
commenced
on
april
th
and
continued
until
june
th
a
new
bill
was
introduced
on
june
th
but
nothing
important
was
done
in
relation
to
it
during
the
session
in
april
nearly
three
years
after
the
signature
of
the
treaty
the
final
action
of
the
french
chambers
upon
the
bill
to
carry
the
treaty
into
effect
was
obtained
and
resulted
in
a
refusal
of
the
necessary
appropriations
the
avowed
grounds
upon
which
the
bill
was
rejected
are
to
be
found
in
the
published
debates
of
that
body
and
no
observations
of
mine
can
be
necessary
to
satisfy
congress
of

their
utter
insufficiency
although
the
gross
amount
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
is
probably
greater
than
will
be
ultimately
allowed
by
the
commissioners
sufficient
is
never
the
less
shown
to
render
it
absolutely
certain
that
the
indemnity
falls
far
short
of
the
actual
amount
of
our
just
claims
independently
of
the
question
of
damages
and
interest
for
the
detention
that
the
settlement
involved
a
sacrifice
in
this
respect
was
well
known
at
the
timea
sacrifice
which
was
cheerfully
acquiesced
in
by
the
different
branches
of
the
federal
government
whose
action
upon
the
treaty
was
required
from
a
sincere
desire
to
avoid
further
collision
upon
this
old
and
disturbing
subject
and
in
the
confident
expectation
that
the
general
relations
between
the
two
countries
would
be
improved
thereby
the
refusal
to
vote
the
appropriation
the
news
of
which
was
received
from
our
minister
in
paris
about
may
th
might
have
been
considered
the
final
determination
of
the
french
government
not
to
execute
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
and
would
have
justified
an
immediate
communication
of
the
facts
to
congress
with
a
recommendation
of
such
ultimate
measures
as
the
interest
and
honor
of
the
united
states
might
seem
to
require
but
with
the
news
of
the
refusal
of
the
chambers
to
make
the
appropriation
were
conveyed
the
regrets
of
the
king
and
a
declaration
that
a
national
vessel
should
be
forthwith
sent
out
with
instructions
to
the
french
minister
to
give
the
most
ample
explanations
of
the
past
and
the
strongest
assurances
for
the
future
after
a
long
passage
the
promised
dispatch
vessel
arrived
the
pledges
given
by
the
french
minister
upon
receipt
of
his
instructions
were
that
as
soon
after
the
election
of
the
new
members
as
the
charter
would
permit
the
legislative
chambers
of
france
should
be
called
together
and
the
proposition
for
an
appropriation
laid
before
them
that
all
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
king
and
his
cabinet
should
be
exerted
to
accomplish
the
object
and
that
the
result
should
be
made
known
early
enough
to
be
communicated
to
congress
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
session
relying
upon
these
pledges
and
not
doubting
that
the
acknowledged
justice
of
our
claims
the
promised
exertions
of
the
king
and
his
cabinet
and
above
all
that
sacred
regard
for
the
national
faith
and
honor
for
which
the
french
character
has
been
so
distinguished
would
secure
an
early
execution
of
the
treaty
in
all
its
parts
i
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
at
the
last
session
i
regret
to
say
that
the
pledges
made
through
the
minister
of
france
have
not
been
redeemed
the
new
chambers
met
on
july
st
and
although
the
subject
of
fulfilling
treaties
was
alluded
to
in
the
speech
from
the
throne
no
attempt
was
made
by
the
king
or
his
cabinet
to
procure
an
appropriation
to
carry
it
into
execution
the
reasons
given
for
this
omission
although
they
might
be
considered
sufficient
in
an
ordinary
case
are
not
consistent
with
the
expectations
founded
upon
the
assurances
given
here
for
there
is
no
constitutional
obstacle
to
entering
into
legislative
business
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
chambers
this
point
however
might
have
been
overlooked
had
not
the
chambers
instead
of
being
called
to
meet
at
so
early
a
day
that
the
result
of
their
deliberations
might
be
communicated
to
me
before
the
meeting
of
congress
been
prorogued
to
december
th
a
period
so
late
that
their
decision
can
scarcely
be
made
known
to
the
present
congress
prior
to
its
dissolution
to
avoid
this
delay
our
minister
in
paris
in
virtue
of
the
assurance
given
by
the
french
minister
in
the
united
states
strongly
urged
the
convocation
of
the
chambers
at
an
earlier
day
but
without
success
it
is
proper
to
remark
however
that
this
refusal
has
been
accompanied
with
the
most
positive
assurances
on
the
part
of
the
executive
government
of
france
of
their
intention
to
press
the
appropriation
at
the
ensuing
session
of
the
chambers
the
executive
branch
of
this
government
has
as
matters
stand
exhausted
all
the
authority
upon
the
subject
with
which
it
is
invested
and
which
it
had
any
reason
to
believe
could
be
beneficially
employed
the
idea
of
acquiescing
in
the
refusal
to
execute
the
treaty
will
not
i
am
confident
be
for
a
moment
entertained
by
any
branch
of
this
government
and
further
negotiation
upon
the
subject
is
equally
out
of
the
question
if
it
shall
be
the
pleasure
of
congress
to
await
the
further
action
of
the
french
chambers
no
further
consideration
of
the
subject
will
at
this
session
probably
be
required
at
your
hands
but
if
from
the
original
delay
in
asking
for
an
appropriation
from
the
refusal
of
the
chambers
to
grant
it
when
asked
from
the
omission
to
bring
the
subject
before
the
chambers
at
their
last
session
from
the
fact
that
including
that
session
there
have
been
five
different
occasions
when
the
appropriation
might
have
been
made
and
from
the
delay
in
convoking
the
chambers
until
some
weeks
after
the
meeting
of
congress
when
it
was
well
known
that
a
communication
of
the
whole
subject
to
congress
at
the
last
session
was
prevented
by
assurances
that
it
should
be
disposed
of
before
its
present
meeting
you
should
feel
yourselves
constrained
to
doubt
whether
it
be
the
intention
of
the
french
government
in
all
its
branches
to
carry
the
treaty
into
effect
and
think
that
such
measures
as
the
occasion
may
be
deemed
to
call
for
should
be
now
adopted
the
important
question
arises
what
those
measures
shall
be
our
institutions
are
essentially
pacific
peace
and
friendly
intercourse
with
all
nations
are
as
much
the
desire
of
our
government
as
they
are
the
interest
of
our
people
but
these
objects
are
not
to
be
permanently
secured
by
surrendering
the
rights
of
our
citizens
or
permitting
solemn
treaties
for
their
indemnity
in
cases
of
flagrant
wrong
to
be
abrogated
or
set
aside
it
is
undoubtedly
in
the
power
of
congress
seriously
to
affect
the
agricultural
and
manufacturing
interests
of
france
by
the
passage
of
laws
relating
to
her
trade
with
the
united
states
her
products
manufactures
and
tonnage
may
be
subjected
to
heavy
duties
in
our
ports
or
all
commercial
intercourse
with
her
may
be
suspended
but
there
are
powerful
and
to
my
mind
conclusive
objections
to
this
mode
of
proceeding
we
can
not
embarrass
or
cut
off
the
trade
of
france
without
at
the
same
time
in
some
degree
embarrassing
or
cutting
off
our
own
trade
the
injury
of
such
a
warfare
must
fall
though
unequally
upon
our
own
citizens
and
could
not
but
impair
the
means
of
the
government
and
weaken
that
united
sentiment
in
support
of
the
rights
and
honor
of
the
nation
which
must
now
pervade
every
bosom
nor
is
it
impossible
that
such
a
course
of
legislation
would
introduce
once
more
into
our
national
councils
those
disturbing
questions
in
relation
to
the
tariff
of
duties
which
have
been
so
recently
put
to
rest
besides
by
every
measure
adopted
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
the
view
of
injuring
france
the
clear
perception
of
right
which
will
induce
our
own
people
and
the
rulers
and
people
of
all
other
nations
even
of
france
herself
to
pronounce
our
quarrel
just
will
be
obscured
and
the
support
rendered
to
us
in
a
final
resort
to
more
decisive
measures
will
be
more
limited
and
equivocal
there
is
but
one
point
of
controversy
and
upon
that
the
whole
civilized
world
must
pronounce
france
to
be
in
the
wrong
we
insist
that
she
shall
pay
us
a
sum
of
money
which
she
has
acknowledged
to
be
due
and
of
the
justice
of
this
demand
there
can
be
but
one
opinion
among
mankind
true
policy
would
seem
to
dictate
that
the
question
at
issue
should
be
kept
thus
disencumbered
and
that
not
the
slightest
pretense
should
be
given
to
france
to
persist
in
her
refusal
to
make
payment
by
any
act
on
our
part
affecting
the
interests
of
her
people
the
question
should
be
left
as
it
is
now
in
such
an
attitude
that
when
france
fulfills
her
treaty
stipulations
all
controversy
will
be
at
an
end
it
is
my
conviction
that
the
united
states
ought
to
insist
on
a
prompt
execution
of
the
treaty
and
in
case
it
be
refused
or
longer
delayed
take
redress
into
their
own
hands
after
the
delay
on
the
part
of
france
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
acknowledging
these
claims
by
treaty
it
is
not
to
be
tolerated
that
another
quarter
of
a
century
is
to
be
wasted
in
negotiating
about
the
payment
the
laws
of
nations
provide
a
remedy
for
such
occasions
it
is
a
wellsettled
principle
of
the
international
code
that
where
one
nation
owes
another
a
liquidated
debt
which
it
refuses
or
neglects
to
pay
the
aggrieved
party
may
seize
on
the
property
belonging
to
the
other
its
citizens
or
subjects
sufficient
to
pay
the
debt
without
giving
just
cause
of
war
this
remedy
has
been
repeatedly
resorted
to
and
recently
by
france
herself
toward
portugal
under
circumstances
less
unquestionable
the
time
at
which
resort
should
be
had
to
this
or
any
other
mode
of
redress
is
a
point
to
be
decided
by
congress
if
an
appropriation
shall
not
be
made
by
the
french
chambers
at
their
next
session
it
may
justly
be
concluded
that
the
government
of
france
has
finally
determined
to
disregard
its
own
solemn
undertaking
and
refuse
to
pay
an
acknowledged
debt
in
that
event
every
days
delay
on
our
part
will
be
a
stain
upon
our
national
honor
as
well
as
a
denial
of
justice
to
our
injured
citizens
prompt
measures
when
the
refusal
of
france
shall
be
complete
will
not
only
be
most
honorable
and
just
but
will
have
the
best
effect
upon
our
national
character
since
france
in
violation
of
the
pledges
given
through
her
minister
here
has
delayed
her
final
action
so
long
that
her
decision
will
not
probably
be
known
in
time
to
be
communicated
to
this
congress
i
recommend
that
a
law
be
passed
authorizing
reprisals
upon

not
be
made
for
the
payment
of
the

at
the
approaching
session
of
the
french
chambers
her
pride
and
power
are
too
well
known
to
expect
any
thing
from
her
fears
and
preclude
the
necessity
of
a
declaration
that
nothing
partaking
of
the
character
of
intimidation
is

intended
by
us
she
ought
to
look
upon
it
as
the
evidence
only
of
an
inflexible
determination
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
insist
on
their
rights
that
government
by
doing
only
what
it
has
itself
acknowledged
to
be
just
will
be
able
to
spare
the
united
states
the
necessity
of
taking
redress
into
their
own
hands
and
save
the
property
of
french
citizens
from
that
seizure
and

which
american

so
long

on

part
the
occasion

she
would
but
add
violence
to
injustice
and
could
not
fail
to
expose
herself
to
the
just
censure
of
civilized
nations
and
to
the
retributive
judgments
of
heaven
collision
with
france
is
the
more
to
be
regretted
on
account
of
the
position
she
occupies
in
europe
in
relation
to
liberal
institutions
but
in
maintaining
our
national
rights
and
honor
all
governments
are
alike
to
us
if
by
a
collision
with
france
in
a
case
where
she
is
clearly
in
the
wrong
the
march
of
liberal
principles
shall
be
impeded
the
responsibility
for
that
result
as
well
as
every
other
will
rest
on
her
own
head
having
submitted
these
considerations
it
belongs
to
congress
to
decide
whether
after
what
has
taken
place
it
will
still
await
the
further
action
of
the
french
chambers
or
now
adopt
such
provisional
measures
as
it
may
deem
necessary
and
best
adapted
to
protect
the
rights
and
maintain
the
honor
of
the
country
what
ever
that
decision
may
be
it
will
be
faithfully
enforced
by
the
executive
as
far
as
he
is
authorized
so
to
do
according
to
the
estimate
of
the
treasury
department
the
revenue
accruing
from
all
sources
during
the
present
year
will
amount
to
which
with
the
balance
remaining
in
the
treasury
on
january
st
of
produces
an
aggregate
of
the
total
expenditure
during
the
year
for
all
objects
including
the
public
debt
is
estimated
at
which
will
leave
a
balance
in
the
treasury
on
january
st
of
in
this
balance
however
will
be
included
about
of
what
was
heretofore
reported
by
the
department
as
not
effective
of
former
appropriations
it
is
estimated
that
there
will
remain
unexpended
at
the
close
of
the
year
and
that
of
this
sum
there
will
not
be
required
more
than
to
accomplish
the
objects
of
all
the
current
appropriations
thus
it
appears
that
after
satisfying
all
those
appropriations
and
after
discharging
the
last
item
of
our
public
debt
which
will
be
done
on
january
st
there
will
remain
unexpended
in
the
treasury
an
effective
balance
of
about
that
such
should
be
the
aspect
of
our
finances
is
highly
flattering
to
the
industry
and
enterprise
of
our
population
and
auspicious
of
the
wealth
and
prosperity
which
await
the
future
cultivation
of
their
growing
resources
it
is
not
deemed
prudent
however
to
recommend
any
change
for
the
present
in
our
impost
rates
the
effect
of
the
gradual
reduction
now
in
progress
in
many
of
them
not
being
sufficiently
tested
to
guide
us
in
determining
the
precise
amount
of
revenue
which
they
will
produce
free
from
public
debt
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
with
no
complicated
interests
to
consult
in
our
intercourse
with
foreign
powers
the
present
may
be
hailed
as
the
epoch
in
our
history
the
most
favorable
for
the
settlement
of
those
principles
in
our
domestic
policy
which
shall
be
best
calculated
to
give
stability
to
our
republic
and
secure
the
blessings
of
freedom
to
our
citizens
among
these
principles
from
our
past
experience
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
simplicity
in
the
character
of
the
federal
government
and
a
rigid
economy
in
its
administration
should
be
regarded
as
fundamental
and
sacred
all
must
be
sensible
that
the
existence
of
the
public
debt
by
rendering
taxation
necessary
for
its
extinguishment
has
increased
the
difficulties
which
are
inseparable
from
every
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
and
that
it
was
in
this
respect
a
remote
agent
in
producing
those
disturbing
questions
which
grew
out
of
the
discussions
relating
to
the
tariff
if
such
has
been
the
tendency
of
a
debt
incurred
in
the
acquisition
and
maintenance
of
our
national
rights
and
liberties
the
obligations
of
which
all
portions
of
the
union
cheerfully
acknowledged
it
must
be
obvious
that
what
ever
is
calculated
to
increase
the
burdens
of
government
without
necessity
must
be
fatal
to
all
our
hopes
of
preserving
its
true
character
while
we
are
felicitating
ourselves
therefore
upon
the
extinguishment
of
the
national
debt
and
the
prosperous
state
of
our
finances
let
us
not
be
tempted
to
depart
from
those
sound
maxims
of
public
policy
which
enjoin
a
just
adaptation
of
the
revenue
to
the
expenditures
that
are
consistent
with
a
rigid
economy
and
an
entire
abstinence
from
all
topics
of
legislation
that
are
not
clearly
within
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
government
and
suggested
by
the
wants
of
the
country
properly
regarded
under
such
a
policy
every
diminution
of
the
public
burdens
arising
from
taxation
gives
to
individual
enterprise
increased
power
and
furnishes
to
all
the
members
of
our
happy
confederacy
new
motives
for
patriotic
affection
and
support
but
above
all
its
most
important
effect
will
be
found
in
its
influence
upon
the
character
of
the
government
by
confining
its
action
to
those
objects
which
will
be
sure
to
secure
to
it
the
attachment
and
support
of
our
fellow
citizens
circumstances
make
it
my
duty
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
bank
of
the
united
states
created
for
the
convenience
of
the
government
that
institution
has
become
the
scourge
of
the
people
its
interference
to
postpone
the
payment
of
a
portion
of
the
national
debt
that
it
might
retain
the
public
money
appropriated
for
that
purpose
to
strengthen
it
in
a
political
contest
the
extraordinary
extension
and
contraction
of
its
accommodations
to
the
community
its
corrupt
and
partisan
loans
its
exclusion
of
the
public
directors
from
a
knowledge
of
its
most
important
proceedings
the
unlimited
authority
conferred
on
the
president
to
expend
its
funds
in
hiring
writers
and
procuring
the
execution
of
printing
and
the
use
made
of
that
authority
the
retention
of
the
pension
money
and
books
after
the
selection
of
new
agents
the
groundless
claim
to
heavy
damages
in
consequence
of
the
protest
of
the
bill
drawn
on
the
french
government
have
through
various
channels
been
laid
before
congress
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
last
session
the
bank
through
its
president
announced
its
ability
and
readiness
to
abandon
the
system
of
unparalleled
curtailment
and
the
interruption
of
domestic
exchanges
which
it
had
practiced
upon
from
august
st
to
june
th
and
to
extend
its
accommodations
to
the
community
the
grounds
assumed
in
this
annunciation
amounted
to
an
acknowledgment
that
the
curtailment
in
the
extent
to
which
it
had
been
carried
was
not
necessary
to
the
safety
of
the
bank
and
had
been
persisted
in
merely
to
induce
congress
to
grant
the
prayer
of
the
bank
in
its
memorial
relative
to
the
removal
of
the
deposits
and
to
give
it
a
new
charter
they
were
substantially
a
confession
that
all
the
real
distresses
which
individuals
and
the
country
had
endured
for
the
preceding
six
or
eight
months
had
been
needlessly
produced
by
it
with
the
view
of
affecting
through
the
sufferings
of
the
people
the
legislative
action
of
congress
it
is
subject
of
congratulation
that
congress
and
the
country
had
the
virtue
and
firmness
to
bear
the
infliction
that
the
energies
of
our
people
soon
found
relief
from
this
wanton
tyranny
in
vast
importations
of
the
precious
metals
from
almost
every
part
of
the
world
and
that
at
the
close
of
this
tremendous
effort
to
control
our
government
the
bank
found
itself
powerless
and
no
longer
able
to
loan
out
its
surplus
means
the
community
had
learned
to
manage
its
affairs
without
its
assistance
and
trade
had
already
found
new
auxiliaries
so
that
on
october
st
the
extraordinary
spectacle
was
presented
of
a
national
more
than
half
of
whose
capital
was
either
lying
unproductive
in
its
vaults
or
in
the
hands
of
foreign
bankers
to
the
needless
distresses
brought
on
the
country
during
the
last
session
of
congress
has
since
been
added
the
open
seizure
of
the
dividends
on
the
public
stock
to
the
amount
of
under
pretense
of
paying
damages
cost
and
interest
upon
the
protested
french
bill
this
sum
constituted
a
portion
of
the
estimated
revenues
for
the
year
upon
which
the
appropriations
made
by
congress
were
based
it
would
as
soon
have
been
expected
that
our
collectors
would
seize
on
the
customs
or
the
receivers
of
our
land
offices
on
the
moneys
arising
from
the
sale
of
public
lands
under
pretenses
of
claims
against
the
united
states
as
that
the
bank
would
have
retained
the
dividends
indeed
if
the
principle
be
established
that
any
one
who
chooses
to
set
up
a
claim
against
the
united
states
may
without
authority
of
law
seize
on
the
public
property
or
money
wherever
he
can
find
it
to
pay
such
claim
there
will
remain
no
assurance
that
our
revenue
will
reach
the
treasury
or
that
it
will
be
applied
after
the
appropriation
to
the
purposes
designated
in
the
law
the
pay
masters
of
our
army
and
the
pursers
of
our
navy
may
under
like
pretenses
apply
to
their
own
use
moneys
appropriated
to
set
in
motion
the
public
force
and
in
time
of
war
leave
the
country
without
defense
this
measure
resorted
to
by
the
bank
is
disorganizing
and
revolutionary
and
if
generally
resorted
to
by
private
citizens
in
like
cases
would
fill
the
land
with
anarchy
and
violence
it
is
a
constitutional
provision
that
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law
the
palpable
object
of
this
provision
is
to
prevent
the
expenditure
of
the
public
money
for
any
purpose
what
so
ever
which
shall
not
have
been
st
approved
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
the
states
in
congress
assembled
it
vests
the
power
of
declaring
for
what
purposes
the
public
money
shall
be
expended
in
the
legislative
department
of
the
government
to
the
exclusion
of
the
executive
a
nd
judicial
and
it
is
not
within
the
constitutional
authority
of
either
of
those
departments
to
pay
it
away
without
law
or
to
sanction
its
payment
according
to
this
plain
constitutional
provision
the
claim
of
the
bank
can
never
be
paid
without
an
appropriation
by
act
of
congress
but
the
bank
has
never
asked
for
an
appropriation
it
attempts
to
defeat
the
provision
of
the
constitution
and
obtain
payment
without
an
act
of
congress
instead
of
awaiting
an
appropriation
passed
by
both
houses
and
approved
by
the
president
it
makes
an
appropriation
for
itself
and
invites
an
appeal
to
the
judiciary
to
sanction
it
that
the
money
had
not
technically
been
paid
into
the
treasury
does
not
affect
the
principle
intended
to
be
established
by
the
constitution
the
executive
and
the
judiciary
have
as
little
right
to
appropriate
and
expend
the
public
money
without
authority
of
law
before
it
is
placed
to
the
credit
of
the
treasury
as
to
take
it
from
the
treasury
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
in
his
correspondence
with
the
president
of
the
bank
and
the
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
accompanying
it
you
will
find
a
further
examination
of
the
claims
of
the
bank
and
the
course
it
has
pursued
it
seems
due
to
the
safety
of
the
people
funds
remaining
in
that
bank
and
to
the
honor
of
the
american
people
that
measures
be
taken
to
separate
the
government
entirely
from
an
institution
so
mischievous
to
the
public
prosperity
and
so
regardless
of
the
constitution
and
laws
by
transferring
the
public
deposits
by
appointing
other
pension
agents
as
far
as
it
had
the
power
by
ordering
the
discontinuance
of
the
receipt
of
bank
checks
in
the
payment
of
the
public
dues
after
january
st
the
executive
has
exerted
all
its
lawful
authority
to
sever
the
connection
between
the
government
and
this
faithless
corporation
the
highhanded
career
of
this
institution
imposes
upon
the
constitutional
functionaries
of
this
government
duties
of
the
gravest
and
most
imperative
characterduties
which
they
can
not
avoid
and
from
which
i
trust
there
will
be
no
inclination
on
the
part
of
any
of
them
to
shrink
my
own
sense
of
them
is
most
clear
as
is
also
my
readiness
to
discharge
those
which
may
rightfully
fall
on
me
to
continue
any
business
relations
with
the
bank
of
the
united
states
that
may
be
avoided
without
a
violation
of
the
national
faith
after
that
institution
has
set
at
open
defiance
the
conceded
right
of
the
government
to
examine
its
affairs
after
it
has
done
all
in
its
power
to
deride
the
public
authority
in
other
respects
and
to
bring
it
into
disrepute
at
home
and
abroad
after
it
has
attempted
to
defeat
the
clearly
expressed
will
of
the
people
by
turning
against
them
the
immense
power
intrusted
to
its
hands
and
by
involving
a
country
otherwise
peaceful
flourishing
and
happy
in
dissension
embarrassment
and
distress
would
make
the
nation
itself
a
party
to
the
degradation
so
sedulously
prepared
for
its
public
agents
and
do
much
to
destroy
the
confidence
of
mankind
in
popular
governments
and
to
bring
into
contempt
their
authority
and
efficiency
in
guarding
against
an
evil
of
such
magnitude
consideration
of
temporary
convenience
should
be
thrown
out
of
the
question
and
we
should
be
influenced
by
such
motives
only
as
look
to
the
honor
and
preservation
of
the
republican
system
deeply
and
solemnly
impressed
with
the
justice
of
these
views
i
feel
it
to
be
my
duty
to
recommend
to
you
that
a
law
be
passed
authorizing
the
sale
of
the
public
stock
that
the
provision
of
the
charter
requiring
the
receipt
of
notes
of
the
bank
in
payment
of
public
dues
shall
in
accordance
with
the
power
reserved
to
congress
in
the
th
section
of
the
charter
be
suspended
until
the
bank
pays
to
the
treasury
the
dividends
withheld
and
that
all
laws
connecting
the
government
or
its
officers
with
the
bank
directly
or
indirectly
be
repealed
and
that
the
institution
be
left
hereafter
to
its
own
resources
and
means
events
have
satisfied
my
mind
and
i
think
the
minds
of
the
american
people
that
the
mischiefs
and
dangers
which
flow
from
a
national
bank
far
overbalance
all
its
advantages
the
bold
effort
the
present
bank
has
made
to
control
the
government
the
distresses
it
has
wantonly
produced
the
violence
of
which
it
has
been
the
occasion
in
one
of
our
cities
famed
for
its
observance
of
law
and
order
are
but
premonitions
of
the
fate
which
awaits
the
american
people
should
they
be
deluded
into
a
perpetuation
of
this
institution
or
the
establishment
of
another
like
it
it
is
fervently
hoped
that
thus
admonished
those
who
have
heretofore
favored
the
establishment
of
a
substitute
for
the
present
bank
will
be
induced
to
abandon
it
as
it
is
evidently
better
to
incur
any
inconvenience
that
may
be
reasonably
expected
than
to
concentrate
the
whole
moneyed
power
of
the
republic
in
any
form
what
so
ever
or
under
any
restrictions
happily
it
is
already
illustrated
that
the
agency
of
such
an
institution
is
not
necessary
to
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
the
state
banks
are
found
fully
adequate
to
the
performance
of
all
services
which
were
required
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
quite
as
promptly
and
with
the
same
cheapness
they
have
maintained
themselves
and
discharged
all
these
duties
while
the
bank
of
the
united
states
was
still
powerful
and
in
the
field
as
an
open
enemy
and
it
is
not
possible
to
conceive
that
they
will
find
greater
difficulties
in
their
operations
when
that
enemy
shall
cease
to
exist
the
attention
of
congress
is
earnestly
invited
to
the
regulation
of
the
deposits
in
the
state
banks
by
law
although
the
power
now
exercised
by
the
executive
department
in
this
behalf
is
only
such
as
was
uniformly
exerted
through
every
administration
from
the
origin
of
the
government
up
to
the
establishment
of
the
present
bank
yet
it
is
one
which
is
susceptible
of
regulation
by
law
and
therefore
ought
so
to
be
regulated
the
power
of
congress
to
direct
in
what
places
the
treasurer
shall
keep
the
moneys
in
the
treasury
and
to
impose
restrictions
upon
the
executive
authority
in
relation
to
their
custody
and
removal
is
unlimited
and
its
exercise
will
rather
be
courted
than
discouraged
by
those
public
officers
and
agents
on
whom
rests
the
responsibility
for
their
safety
it
is
desirable
that
as
little
power
as
possible
should
be
left
to
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
over
those
institutions
which
being
thus
freed
from
executive
influence
and
without
a
common
head
to
direct
their
operations
would
have
neither
the
temptation
nor
the
ability
to
interfere
in
the
political
conflicts
of
the
country
not
deriving
their
charters
from
the
national
authorities
they
would
never
have
those
inducements
to
meddle
in
general
elections
which
have
led
the
bank
of
the
united
states
to
agitate
and
convulse
the
country
for
upward
of
two
years
the
progress
of
our
gold
coinage
is
creditable
to
the
officers
of
the
mint
and
promises
in
a
short
period
to
furnish
the
country
with
a
sound
and
portable
currency
which
will
much
diminish
the
inconvenience
to
travelers
of
the
want
of
a
general
paper
currency
should
the
state
banks
be
incapable
of
furnishing
it
those
institutions
have
already
shown
themselves
competent
to
purchase
and
furnish
domestic
exchange
for
the
convenience
of
trade
at
reasonable
rates
and
not
a
doubt
is
entertained
that
in
a
short
period
all
the
wants
of
the
country
in
bank
accommodations
and
exchange
will
be
supplied
as
promptly
and
as
cheaply
as
they
have
heretofore
been
by
the
bank
of
the
united
states
if
the
several
states
shall
be
induced
gradually
to
reform
their
banking
systems
and
prohibit
the
issue
of
all
small
notes
we
shall
in
a
few
years
have
a
currency
as
sound
and
as
little
liable
to
fluctuations
as
any
other
commercial
country
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
together
with
the
accompanying
documents
from
the
several
bureaux
of
that
department
will
exhibit
the
situation
of
the
various
objects
committed
to
its
administration
no
event
has
occurred
since
your
last
session
rendering
necessary
any
movements
of
the
army
with
the
exception
of
the
expedition
of
the
regiment
of
dragoons
into
the
territory
of
the
wandering
and
predatory
tribes
inhabiting
the
western
frontier
and
living
adjacent
to
the
mexican
boundary
these
tribes
have
been
heretofore
known
to
us
principally
by
their
attacks
upon
our
own
citizens
and
upon
other
indians
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
united
states
it
became
necessary
for
the
peace
of
the
frontiers
to
check
these
habitual
inroads
and
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
the
object
has
been
effected
without
the
commission
of
any
act
of
hostility
colonel
dodge
and
the
troops
under
his
command
have
acted
with
equal
firmness
and
humanity
and
an
arrangement
has
been
made
with
those
indians
which
it
is
hoped
will
assure
their
permanent
pacific
relations
with
the
united
states
and
the
other
tribes
of
indians
upon
that
border
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
prevalence
of
sickness
in
that
quarter
has
deprived
the
country
of
a
number
of
valuable
lives
and
particularly
that
general
leavenworth
an
officer
well
known
and
esteemed
for
his
gallant
services
in
the
late
war
and
for
his
subsequent
good
conduct
has
fallen
a
victim
to
his
zeal
and
exertions
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
the
army
is
in
a
high
state
of
discipline
its
moral
condition
so
far
as
that
is
known
here
is
good
and
the
various
branches
of
the
public
service
are
carefully
attended
to
it
is
amply
sufficient
under
its
present
organization
for
providing
the
necessary
garrisons
for
the
seaboard
and
for
the
defense
of
the
internal
frontier
and
also
for
preserving
the
elements
of
military
knowledge
and
for
keeping
pace
with
those
improvements
which
modern
experience
is
continually
making
and
these
objects
appear
to
me
to
embrace
all
the
legitimate
purposes
for
which
a
permanent
military
force
should
be
maintained
in
our
country
the
lessons
of
history
teach
us
its
danger
and
the
tendency
which
exists
to
an
increase
this
can
be
best
met
and
averted
by
a
just
caution
on
the
part
of
the
public
itself
and
of

those
who
represent
them
in
congress
from
the
duties
which
devolve
on
the
engineer
department
and
upon
the
topographical
engineers
a
different
organization
seems
to
be
demanded
by
the
public
interest
and
i
recommend
the
subject
to
your
consideration
no
important
change
has
during
this
season
taken
place
in
the
condition
of
the
indians
arrangements
are
in
progress
for
the
removal
of
the
creeks
and
will
soon
be
for
the
removal
of
the
seminoles
i
regret
that
the
cherokees
east
of
the
mississippi
have
not
yet
determined
as
a
community
to
remove
how
long
the
personal
causes
which
have
heretofore
retarded
that
ultimately
inevitable
measure
will
continue
to
operate
i
am
unable
to
conjecture
it
is
certain
however
that
delay
will
bring
with
it
accumulated
evils
which
will
render
their
condition
more
and
more
unpleasant
the
experience
of
every
year
adds
to
the
conviction
that
emigration
and
that
alone
can
preserve
from
destruction
the
remnant
of
the
tribes
yet
living
amongst
us
the
facility
with
which
the
necessaries
of
life
are
procured
and
the
treaty
stipulations
providing
aid
for
the
emigrant
indians
in
their
agricultural
pursuits
and
in
the
important
concern
of
education
and
their
removal
from
those
causes
which
have
heretofore
depressed
all
and
destroyed
many
of
the
tribes
can
not
fail
to
stimulate
their
exertions
and
to
reward
their
industry
the
two
laws
passed
at
the
last
session
of
congress
on
the
subject
of
indian
affairs
have
been
carried
into
effect
and
detailed
instructions
for
their
administration
have
been
given
it
will
be
seen
by
the
estimates
for
the
present
session
that
a
great
reduction
will
take
place
in
the
expenditures
of
the
department
in
consequence
of
these
laws
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
their
operation
will
be
salutary
and
that
the
colonization
of
the
indians
on
the
western
frontier
together
with
a
judicious
system
of
administration
will
still
further
reduce
the
expenses
of
this
branch
of
the
public
service
and
at
the
same
time
promote
its
usefulness
and
efficiency
circumstances
have
been
recently
developed
showing
the
existence
of
extensive
frauds
under
the
various
laws
granting
pensions
and
gratuities
for
revolutionary
services
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
the
amount
which
may
have
been
thus
fraudulently
obtained
from
the
national
treasury
i
am
satisfied
however
it
has
been
such
as
to
justify
a
reexamination
of
the
system
and
the
adoption
of
the
necessary
checks
in
its
administration
all
will
agree
that
the
services
and
sufferings
of
the
remnant
of
our
revolutionary
band
should
be
fully
compensated
but
while
this
is
done
every
proper
precaution
should
be
taken
to
prevent
the
admission
of
fabricated
and
fraudulent
claims
in
the
present
mode
of
proceeding
the
attestations
and
certificates
of
the
judicial
officers
of
the
various
states
from
a
considerable
portion
of
the
checks
which
are
interposed
against
the
commission
of
frauds
these
however
have
been
and
may
be
fabricated
and
in
such
a
way
as
to
elude
detection
at
the
examining
offices
and
independently
of
this
practical
difficulty
it
is
ascertained
that
these
documents
are
often
loosely
granted
some
times
even
blank
certificates
have
been
issued
some
times
prepared
papers
have
been
signed
without
inquiry
and
in
one
instance
at
least
the
seal
of
the
court
has
been
within
reach
of
a
person
most
interested
in
its
improper
application
it
is
obvious
that
under
such
circumstances
no
severity
of
administration
can
check
the
abuse
of
the
law
and
information
has
from
time
to
time
been
communicated
to
the
pension
office
questioning
or
denying
the
right
of
persons
placed
upon
the
pension
list
to
the
bounty
of
the
country
such
cautions
are
always
attended
to
and
examined
but
a
far
more
general
investigation
is
called
for
and
i
therefore
recommend
in
conformity
with
the
suggestion
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
an
actual
inspection
should
be
made
in
each
state
into
the
circumstances
and
claims
of
every
person
now
drawing
a
pension
the
honest
veteran
has
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
scrutiny
while
the
fraudulent
claimant
will
be
detected
and
the
public
treasury
relieved
to
an
amount
i
have
reason
to
believe
far
greater
than
has
heretofore
been
suspected
the
details
of
such
a
plan
could
be
so
regulated
as
to
interpose
the
necessary
checks
without
any
burdensome
operation
upon
the
pensioners
the
object
should
be
twofold
to
look
into
the
original
justice
of
the
claims
so
far
as
this
can
be
done
under
a
proper
system
of
regulations
by
an
examination
of
the
claimants
themselves
and
by
inquiring
in
the
vicinity
of
their
residence
into
their
history
and
into
the
opinion
entertained
of
their
revolutionary
services
to
ascertain
in
all
cases
whether
the
original
claimant
is
living
and
this
by
actual
personal
inspection
this
measure
will
if
adopted
be
productive
i
think
of
the
desired
results
and
i
therefore
recommend
it
to
your
consideration
with
the
further
suggestion
that
all
payments
should
be
suspended
til
the
necessary
reports
are
received
it
will
be
seen
by
a
tabular
statement
annexed
to
the
documents
transmitted
to
congress
that
the
appropriations
for
objects
connected
with
the
war
department
made
at
the
last
session
for
the
service
of
the
year
excluding
the
permanent
appropriation
for
the
payment
of
military
gratuities
under
the
act
of
june
th
the
appropriation
of
for
arming
and
equipping
the
militia
and
the
appropriation
of
for
the
civilization
of
the
indians
which
are
not
annually
renewed
amounted
to
the
sum
of
and
that
the
estimates
of
appropriations
necessary
for
the
same
branches
of
service
for
the
year
amount
to
the
sum
of
making
a
difference
in
the
appropriations
of
the
current
year
over
the
estimates
of
the
appropriations
for
the
next
of
the
principal
causes
which
have
operated
at
this
time
to
produce
this
great
difference
are
shown
in
the
reports
and
documents
and
in
the
detailed
estimates
some
of
these
causes
are
accidental
and
temporary
while
others
are
permanent
and
aided
by
a
just
course
of
administration
may
continue
to
operate
beneficially
upon
the
public
expenditures
a
just
economy
expending
where
the
public
service
requires
and
withholding
where
it
does
not
is
among
the
indispensable
duties
of
the
government
i
refer
you
to
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
and
to
the
documents
with
it
for
a
full
view
of
the
operations
of
that
important
branch
of
our
service
during
the
present
year
it
will
be
seen
that
the
wisdom
and
liberality
with
which
congress
has
provided
for
the
gradual
increase
of
our
navy
material
have
been
seconded
by
a
corresponding
zeal
and
fidelity
on
the
part
of
those
to
whom
has
been
confided
the
execution
of
the
laws
on
the
subject
and
that
but
a
short
period
would
be
now
required
to
put
in
commission
a
force
large
enough
for
any
exigency
into
which
the
country
may
be
thrown
when
we
reflect
upon
our
position
in
relation
to
other
nations
it
must
be
apparent
that
in
the
event
of
conflicts
with
them
we
must
look
chiefly
to
our
navy
for
the
protection
of
our
national
rights
the
wide
seas
which
separate
us
from
other
governments
must
of
necessity
be
the
theater
on
which
an
enemy
will
aim
to
assail
us
and
unless
we
are
prepared
to
meet
him
on
this
element
we
can
not
be
said
to
possess
the
power
requisite
to
repel
or
prevent
aggressions
we
can
not
therefore
watch
with
too
much
attention
this
arm
of
our
defense
or
cherish
with
too
much
care
the
means
by
which
it
can
possess
the
necessary
efficiency
and
extension
to
this
end
our
policy
has
been
heretofore
wisely
directed
to
the
constant
employment
of
a
force
sufficient
to
guard
our
commerce
and
to
the
rapid
accumulation
of
the
materials
which
are
necessary
to
repair
our
vessels
and
construct
with
ease
such
new
ones
as
may
be
required
in
a
state
of
war
in
accordance
with
this
policy
i
recommend
to
your
consideration
the
erection
of
the
additional
dry
dock
described
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
and
also
the
construction
of
the
steam
batteries
to
which
he
has
referred
for
the
purpose
of
testing
their
efficacy
as
auxiliaries
to
the
system
of
defense
now
in
use
the
report
of
the
post
master
general
herewith
submitted
exhibits
the
condition
and
prospects
of
that
department
from
that
document
it
appears
that
there
was
a
deficit
in
the
funds
of
the
department
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
year
beyond
its
available
means
of
which
on
the
first
of
july
last
had
been
reduced
to
it
appears
also
that
the
revenues
for
the
coming
year
will
exceed
the
expenditures
about
which
with
the
excess
of
revenue
which
will
result
from
the
operations
of
the
current
half
year
may
be
expected
independently
of
any
increase
in
the
gross
amount
of
postages
to
supply
the
entire
deficit
before
the
end
of
but
as
this
calculation
is
based
on
the
gross
amount
of
postages
which
had
accrued
within
the
period
embraced
by
the
times
of
striking
the
balances
it
is
obvious
that
without
a
progressive
increase
in
the
amount
of
postages
the
existing
retrenchments
must
be
persevered
in
through
the
year
that
the
department
may
accumulate
a
surplus
fund
sufficient
to
place
it
in
a
condition
of
perfect
ease
it
will
be
observed
that
the
revenues
of
the
post
office
department
though
they
have
increased
and
their
amount
is
above
that
of
any
former
year
have
yet
fallen
short
of
the
estimates
more
than
this
is
attributed
in
a
great
degree
to
the
increase
of
free
letters
growing
out
of
the
extension
and
abuse
of
the
franking
privilege
there
has
been
a
gradual
increase
in
the
number
of
executive
offices
to
which
it
has
been
granted
and
by
an
act
passed
in
march
it
was
extended
to
members
of
congress
throughout
the
whole
year
it
is
believed
that
a
revision
of
the
laws
relative
to
the
franking
privilege
with
some
enactments
to
enforce
more
rigidly
the
restrictions
under
which
it
is
granted
would
operate
beneficially
to
the
country
by
enabling
the
department
at
an
earlier
period
to
restore
the
mail
facilities
that
have
been
withdrawn
and
to
extend
them
more
widely
as
the
growing
settlements
of
the
country
may
requi
re
to
a
measure
so
important
to
the
government
and
so
just
to
our
constituents
who
ask
no
exclusive
privileges
for
themselves
and
are
not
willing
to
concede
them
to
others
i
earnestly
recommend
the
serious
attention
of
congress
the
importance
of
the
post
office
department
and
the
magnitude
to
which
it
has
grown
both
in
its
revenues
and
in
its
operations
seem
to
demand
its
reorganization
by
law
the
whole
of
its
receipts
and
disbursements
have
hitherto
been
left
entirely
to
executive
control
and
individual
discretion
the
principle
is
as
sound
in
relation
to
this
as
to
any
other
department
of
the
government
that
as
little
discretion
should
be
confided
to
the
executive
officer
who
controls
it
as
is
compatible
with
its
efficiency
it
is
therefore
earnestly
recommended
that
it
be
organized
with
an
auditor
and
treasurer
of
its
own
appointed
by
the
president
and
senate
who
shall
be
branches
of
the
treasury
department
your
attention
is
again
respectfully
invited
to
the
defect
which
exists
in
the
judicial
system
of
the
united
states
nothing
can
be
more
desirable
than
the
uniform
operation
of
the
federal
judiciary
throughout
the
several
states
all
of
which
standing
on
the
same
footing
as
members
of
the
union
have
equal
rights
to
the
advantages
and
benefits
resulting
from
its
laws
this
object
is
not
attained
by
the
judicial
acts
now
in
force
because
they
leave
one
quarter
of
the
states
without
circuit
courts
it
is
undoubtedly
the
duty
of
congress
to
place
all
the
states
on
the
same
footing
in
this
respect
either
by
the
creation
of
an
additional
number
of
associate
judges
or
by
an
enlargement
of
the
circuits
assigned
to
those
already
appointed
so
as
to
include
the
new
states
what
ever
may
be
the
difficulty
in
a
proper
organization
of
the
judicial
system
so
as
to
secure
its
efficiency
and
uniformity
in
all
parts
of
the
union
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
such
an
increase
of
judges
as
would
encumber
the
supreme
appellate
tribunal
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
weigh
against
the
great
injustice
which
the
present
operation
of
the
system
produces
i
trust
that
i
may
be
also
pardoned
for
renewing
the
recommendation
i
have
so
often
submitted
to
your
attention
in
regard
to
the
mode
of
electing
the
president
and
vice
president
of
the
united
states
all
the
reflection
i
have
been
able
to
bestow
upon
the
subject
increases
my
conviction
that
the
best
interests
of
the
country
will
be
promoted
by
the
adoption
of
some
plan
which
will
secure
in
all
contingencies
that
important
right
of
sovereignty
to
the
direct
control
of
the
people
could
this
be
attained
and
the
terms
of
those
officers
be
limited
to
a
single
period
of
either
four
or
six
years
i
think
our
liberties
would
possess
an
additional
safeguard
at
your
last
session
i
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
destruction
of
the
public
building
occupied
by
the
treasury
department
as
the
public
interest
requires
that
another
building
should
be
erected
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
it
is
hoped
that
the
means
will
be
seasonably
provided
and
that
they
will
be
ample
enough
to
authorize
such
an
enlargement
and
improvement
in
the
plan
of
the
building
as
will
more
effectually
accommodate
the
public
officers
and
secure
the
public
documents
deposited
in
it
from
the
casualties
of
fire
i
have
not
been
able
to
satisfy
myself
that
the
bill
entitled
an
act
to
improve
the
navigation
of
the
wabash
river
which
was
sent
to
me
at
the
close
of
your
last
session
ought
to
pass
and
i
have
therefore
withheld
from
it
my
approval
and
now
return
it
to
the
senate
the
body
in
which
it
originated
there
can
be
no
question
connected
with
the
administration
of
public
affairs
more
important
or
more
difficult
to
be
satisfactorily
dealt
with
than
that
which
relates
to
the
rightful
authority
and
proper
action
of
the
federal
government
upon
the
subject
of
internal
improvements
to
inherent
embarrassments
have
been
added
others
resulting
from
the
course
of
our
legislation
concerning
it
i
have
heretofore
communicated
freely
with
congress
upon
this
subject
and
in
adverting
to
it
again
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
my
increased
conviction
of
its
extreme
importance
as
well
in
regard
to
its
bearing
upon
the
maintenance
of
the
constitution
and
the
prudent
management
of
the
public
revenue
as
on
account
of
its
disturbing
effect
upon
the
harmony
of
the
union
we
are
in
no
danger
from
violations
of
the
constitution
by
which
encroachments
are
made
upon
the
personal
rights
of
the
citizen
the
sentence
of
condemnation
long
since
pronounced
by
the
american
people
upon
acts
of
that
character
will
i
doubt
not
continue
to
prove
as
salutary
in
its
effects
as
it
is
irreversible
in
its
nature
but
against
the
dangers
of
unconstitutional
acts
which
instead
of
menacing
the
vengeance
of
offended
authority
proffer
local
advantages
and
bring
in
their
train
the
patronage
of
the
government
we
are
i
fear
not
so
safe
to
suppose
that
because
our
government
has
been
instituted
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
it
must
therefore
have
the
power
to
do
what
ever
may
seem
to
conduce
to
the
public
good
is
an
error
into
which
even
honest
minds
are
too
apt
to
fall
in
yielding
themselves
to
this
fallacy
they
overlook
the
great
considerations
in
which
the
federal
constitution
was
founded
they
forget
that
in
consequence
of
the
conceded
diversities
in
the
interest
and
condition
of
the
different
states
it
was
foreseen
at
the
period
of
its
adoption
that
although
a
particular
measure
of
the
government
might
be
beneficial
and
proper
in
one
state
it
might
be
the
reverse
in
another
that
it
was
for
this
reason
the
states
would
not
consent
to
make
a
grant
to
the
federal
government
of
the
general
and
usual
powers
of
government
but
of
such
only
as
were
specifically
enumerated
and
the
probable
effects
of
which
they
could
as
they
thought
safely
anticipate
and
they
forget
also
the
paramount
obligation
upon
all
to
abide
by
the
compact
then
so
solemnly
and
as
it
was
hoped
so
firmly
established
in
addition
to
the
dangers
to
the
constitution
springing
from
the
sources
i
have
stated
there
has
been
one
which
was
perhaps
greater
than
all
i
allude
to
the
materials
which
this
subject
has
afforded
for
sinister
appeals
to
selfish
feelings
and
the
opinion
heretofore
so
extensively
entertained
of
its
adaptation
to
the
purposes
of
personal
ambition
with
such
stimulus
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
acts
and
pretensions
of
the
federal
government
in
this
behalf
should
some
times
have
been
carried
to
an
alarming
extent
the
questions
which
have
arisen
upon
this
subject
have
relatedto
the
power
of
making
internal
improvements
within
the
limits
of
a
state
with
the
right
of
territorial
jurisdiction
sufficient
at
least
for
their
preservation
and
use
to
the
right
of
appropriating
money
in
aid
of
such
works
when
carried
on
by
a
state
of
by
a
company
in
virtue
of
state
authority
surrendering
the
claim
of
jurisdiction
and
to
the
propriety
of
appropriation
for
improvements
of
a
particular
class
viz
for
light
houses
beacons
buoys
public
piers
and
for
the
removal
of
sand
bars
sawyers
and
other
temporary
and
partial
impediments
in
our
navigable
rivers
and
harbors
the
claims
of
power
for
the
general
government
upon
each
of
these
points
certainly
present
matter
of
the
deepest
interest
the
first
is
however
of
much
the
greatest
importance
in
as
much
as
in
addition
to
the
dangers
of
unequal
and
improvident
expenditures
of
public
moneys
common
to
all
there
is
superadded
to
that
the
conflicting
jurisdictions
of
the
respective
governments
federal
jurisdiction
at
least
to
the
extent
i
have
stated
has
been
justly
regarded
by
its
advocates
as
necessarily
appurtenant
to
the
power
in
question
if
that
exists
by
the
constitution
that
the
most
injurious
conflicts
would
unavoidably
arise
between
the
respective
jurisdictions
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
in
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
provision
marking
out
their
respective
boundaries
can
not
be
doubted
the
local
advantages
to
be
obtained
would
induce
the
states
to
overlook
in
the
beginning
the
dangers
and
difficulties
to
which
they
might
ultimately
be
exposed
the
powers
exercised
by
the
federal
government
would
soon
be
regarded
with
jealousy
by
the
state
authorities
and
originating
as
they
must
from
implication
or
assumption
it
would
be
impossible
to
affix
to
them
certain
and
safe
limits
opportunities
and
temptations
to
the
assumption
of
power
incompatible
with
state
sovereignty
would
be
increased
and
those
barriers
which
resist
the
tendency
of
our
system
toward
consolidation
greatly
weakened
the
officers
and
agents
of
the
general
government
might
not
always
have
the
discretion
to
abstain
from
intermeddling
with
state
concerns
and
if
they
did
they
would
not
always
escape
the
suspicion
of
having
done
so
collisions
and
consequent
irritations
would
spring
up
that
harmony
which
should
ever
exist
between
the
general
government
and
each
member
of
the
confederacy
would
be
frequently
interrupted
a
spirit
of
contention
would
be
engendered
and
the
dangers
of
disunion
greatly
multiplied
yet
we
know
that
not
withstanding
these
grave
objections
this
dangerous
doctrine
was
at
one
time
apparently
proceeding
to
its
final
establishment
with
fearful
rapidity
the
desire
to
embark
the
federal
government
in
works
of
internal
improvement
prevailed
in
the
highest
degree
during
the
first
session
of
the
first
congress
that
i
had
the
honor
to
meet
in
my
present
situation
when
the
bill
authorizing
a
subscription
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
for
stock
in
the
maysville
and
lexington
turn
pike
company
passed
the
two
houses
there
had
been
reported
by
the
committees
of
internal
improvements
bills
containing
appropriations
for
such
objects
inclusive
of
those
for
the
cumberland
road
and
for
harbors
and
light
houses
to
the
amount
of
in
this
amount
was
included
authority
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
subscribe
for
the
stock
of
different
companies
to
a
great
extent
and
the
residue
was
principally
for
the
direct
construction
of
roads
by
this
government
in
addition
to
these
projects
which
had
been
pr
esented
to
the
two
houses
under
the
sanction
and
recommendation
of
their
respective
committees
on
internal
improvements
there
were
then
still
pending
before
the
committees
and
in
memorials
to
congress
presented
but
not
referred
different
projects
for
works
of
a
similar
character
the
expense
of
which
can
not
be
estimated
with
certainty
but
must
have
exceeded
regarding
the
bill
authorizing
a
subscription
to
the
stock
of
the
maysville
and
lexington
turn
pike
company
as
the
entering
wedge
of
a
system
which
however
weak
at
first
might
soon
become
strong
enough
to
rive
the
bands
of
the
union
asunder
and
believing
that
if
its
passage
was
acquiesced
in
by
the
executive
and
the
people
there
would
no
longer
be
any
limitation
upon
the
authority
of
the
general
government
in
respect
to
the
appropriation
of
money
for
such
objects
i
deemed
it
an
imperative
duty
to
withhold
from
it
the
executive
approval
although
from
the
obviously
local
character
of
that
work
i
might
well
have
contented
myself
with
a
refusal
to
approve
the
bill
upon
that
ground
yet
sensible
of
the
vital
importance
of
the
subject
and
anxious
that
my
views
and
opinions
in
regard
to
the
whole
matter
should
be
fully
understood
by
congress
and
by
my
constituents
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
go
further
i
therefore
embraced
that
early
occasion
to
apprise
congress
that
in
my
opinion
the
constitution
did
not
confer
upon
it
the
power
to
authorize
the
construction
of
ordinary
roads
and
canals
within
the
limits
of
a
state
and
to
say
respectfully
that
no
bill
admitting
such
a
power
could
receive
my
official
sanction
i
did
so
in
the
confident
expectation
that
the
speedy
settlement
of
the
public
mind
upon
the
whole
subject
would
be
greatly
facilitated
by
the
difference
between
the
two
houses
and
myself
and
that
the
harmonious
action
of
the
several
departments
of
the
federal
government
in
regard
to
it
would
be
ultimately
secured
so
far
at
least
as
it
regards
this
branch
of
the
subject
my
best
hopes
have
been
realized
nearly
four
years
have
elapsed
and
several
sessions
of
congress
have
intervened
and
no
attempt
within
my
recollection
has
been
made
to
induce
congress
to
exercise
this
power
the
applications
for
the
construction
of
roads
and
canals
which
were
formerly
multiplied
upon
your
files
are
no
longer
presented
and
we
have
good
reason
to
infer
that
the
current
public
sentiment
has
become
so
decided
against
the
pretension
as
effectually
to
discourage
its
reassertion
so
thinking
i
derive
the
greatest
satisfaction
from
the
conviction
that
thus
much
at
least
has
been
secured
upon
this
important
and
embarrassing
subject
from
attempts
to
appropriate
the
national
funds
to
objects
which
are
confessedly
of
a
local
character
we
can
not
i
trust
have
anything
further
to
apprehend
my
views
in
regard
to
the
expediency
of
making
appropriations
for
works
which
are
claimed
to
be
of
a
national
character
and
prosecuted
under
state
authorityassuming
that
congress
have
the
right
to
do
sowere
stated
in
my
annual
message
to
congress
in
and
also
in
that
containing
my
objections
to
the
maysville
road
bill
so
thoroughly
convinced
am
i
that
no
such
appropriations
ought
to
be
made
by
congress
until
a
suitable
constitutional
provision
is
made
upon
the
subject
and
so
essential
do
i
regard
the
point
to
the
highest
interests
of
our
country
that
i
could
not
consider
myself
as
discharging
my
duty
to
my
constituents
in
giving
the
executive
sanction
to
any
bill
containing
such
an
appropriation
if
the
people
of
the
united
states
desire
that
the
public
treasury
shall
be
resorted
to
for
the
means
to
prosecute
such
works
they
will
concur
in
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
prescribing
a
rule
by
which
the
national
character
of
the
works
is
to
be
tested
and
by
which
the
greatest
practicable
equality
of
benefits
may
be
secured
to
each
member
of
the
confederacy
the
effects
of
such
a
regulation
would
be
most
salutary
in
preventing
unprofitable
expenditures
in
securing
our
legislation
from
the
pernicious
consequences
of
a
scramble
for
the
favors
of
government
and
in
repressing
the
spirit
of
discontent
which
must
inevitably
arise
from
an
unequal
distribution
of
treasures
which
belong
alike
to
all
there
is
another
class
of
appropriations
for
what
may
be
called
without
impropriety
internal
improvements
which
have
always
been
regarded
as
standing
upon
different
grounds
from
those
to
which
i
have
referred
i
allude
to
such
as
have
for
their
object
the
improvement
of
our
harbors
the
removal
of
partial
and
temporary
obstructions
in
our
navigable
rivers
for
the
facility
and
security
of
our
foreign
commerce
the
grounds
upon
which
i
distinguished
appropriations
of
this
character
from
others
have
already
been
stated
to
congress
i
will
now
only
add
that
at
the
st
session
of
congress
under
the
new
constitution
it
was
provided
by
law
that
all
expenses
which
should
accrue
from
and
after
the
th
day
of
august
in
the
necessary
support
and
maintenance
and
repairs
of
all
light
houses
beacons
buoys
and
public
piers
erected
placed
or
sunk
before
the
passage
of
the
act
within
any
bay
inlet
harbor
or
port
of
the
united
states
for
rendering
the
navigation
thereof
easy
and
safe
should
be
defrayed
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
further
that
it
should
be
the
duty
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
provide
by
contracts
with
the
approbation
of
the
president
for
rebuilding
when
necessary
and
keeping
in
good
repair
the
light
houses
beacons
buoys
and
public
piers
in
the
several
states
and
for
furnishing
them
with
supplies
appropriations
for
similar
objects
have
been
continued
from
that
time
to
the
present
without
interruption
or
dispute
as
a
natural
consequence
of
the
increase
and
extension
of
our
foreign
commerce
ports
of
entry
and
delivery
have
been
multiplied
and
established
not
only
upon
our
seaboard
but
in
the
interior
of
the
country
upon
our
lakes
and
navigable
rivers
the
convenience
and
safety
of
this
commerce
have
led
to
the
gradual
extension
of
these
expenditures
to
the
erection
of
light
houses
the
placing
planting
and
sinking
of
buoys
beacons
and
piers
and
to
the
removal
of
partial
and
temporary
obstructions
in
our
navigable
rivers
and
in
the
harbors
upon
our
great
lakes
as
well
as
on
the
seaboard
although
i
have
expressed
to
congress
my
apprehension
that
these
expenditures
have
some
times
been
extravagant
and
disproportionate
to
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
them
i
have
not
felt
it
to
be
my
duty
to
refuse
my
assent
to
bills
containing
them
and
have
contented
myself
to
follow
in
this
respect
in
the
footsteps
of
all
my
predecessors
sensible
however
from
experience
and
observation
of
the
great
abuses
to
which
the
unrestricted
exercise
of
this
authority
by
congress
was
exposed
i
have
prescribed
a
limitation
for
the
government
of
my
own
conduct
by
which
expenditures
of
this
character
are
confined
to
places
below
the
ports
of
entry
or
delivery
established
by
law
i
am
very
sensible
that
this
restriction
is
not
as
satisfactory
as
could
be
desired
and
that
much
embarrassment
may
be
caused
to
the
executive
department
in
its
execution
by
appropriations
for
remote
and
not
wellunderstood
objects
but
as
neither
my
own
reflections
nor
the
lights
which
i
may
properly
derive
from
other
sources
have
supplied
me
with
a
better
i
shall
continue
to
apply
my
best
exertions
to
a
faithful
application
of
the
rule
upon
which
it
is
founded
i
sincerely
regret
that
i
could
not
give
my
assent
to
the
bill
entitled
an
act
to
improve
the
navigation
of
the
wabash
river
but
i
could
not
have
done
so
without
receding
from
the
ground
which
i
have
upon
the
fullest
consideration
taken
upon
this
subject
and
of
which
congress
has
been
heretofore
apprised
and
without
throwing
the
subject
again
open
to
abuses
which
no
good
citizen
entertaining
my
opinions
could
desire
i
rely
upon
the
intelligence
and
candor
of
my
fellow
citizens
in
whose
liberal
indulgence
i
have
already
so
largely
participated
for
a
correct
appreciation
on
my
motives
in
interposing
as
i
have
done
on
this
and
other
occasions
checks
to
a
course
of
legislation
which
without
in
the
slightest
degree
calling
in
question
the
motives
of
others
i
consider
as
sanctioning
improper
and
unconstitutional
expenditures
of
public
treasure
i
am
not
hostile
to
internal
improvements
and
wish
to
see
them
extended
to
every
part
of
the
country
but
i
am
fully
persuaded
if
they
are
not
commenced
in
a
proper
manner
confined
to
proper
objects
and
conducted
under
an
authority
generally
conceded
to
be
rightful
that
a
successful
prosecution
of
them
can
not
be
reasonably
expected
the
attempt
will
meet
with
resistance
where
it
might
otherwise
receive
support
and
instead
of
strengthening
the
bonds
of
our
confederacy
it
will
only
multiply
and
aggravate
the
causes
of
disunion

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
on
your
assembling
to
perform
the
high
trusts
which
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
confided
to
you
of
legislating
for
their
common
welfare
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
congratulate
you
upon
the
happy
condition
of
our
beloved
country
by
the
favor
of
divine
providence
health
is
again
restored
to
us
peace
reigns
within
our
borders
abundance
crowns
the
labors
of
our
fields
commerce
and
domestic
industry
flourish
and
increase
and
individual
happiness
rewards
the
private
virtue
and
enterprise
of
our
citizens
our
condition
abroad
is
no
less
honorable
than
it
is
prosperous
at
home
seeking
nothing
that
is
not
right
and
determined
to
submit
to
nothing
that
is
wrong
but
desiring
honest
friendships
and
liberal
intercourse
with
all
nations
the
united
states
have
gained
throughout
the
world
the
confidence
and
respect
which
are
due
to
a
policy
so
just
and
so
congenial
to
the
character
of
the
american
people
and
to
the
spirit
of
their
institutions
in
bringing
to
your
notice
the
particular
state
of
our
foreign
affairs
it
affords
me
high
gratification
to
inform
you
that
they
are
in
a
condition
which
promises
the
continuance
of
friendship
with
all
nations
with
great
britain
the
interesting
question
of
our
north
east
boundary
remains
still
undecided
a
negotiation
however
upon
that
subject
has
been
renewed
since
the
close
of
the
last
congress
and
a
proposition
has
been
submitted
to
the
british
government
with
the
view
of
establishing
in
conformity
with
the
resolution
of
the
senate
the
line
designated
by
the
treaty
of
though
no
definitive
answer
has
been
received
it
may
be
daily
looked
for
and
i
entertain
a
hope
that
the
overture
may
ultimately
lead
to
a
satisfactory
adjustment
of
this
important
matter
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
inform
you
that
a
negotiation
which
by
desire
of
the
house
of
representatives
was
opened
some
years
ago
with
the
british
government
for
the
erection
of
light
houses
on
the
bahamas
has
been
successful
those
works
when
completed
together
with
those
which
the
united
states
have
constructed
on
the
western
side
of
the
gulf
of
florida
will
contribute
essentially
to
the
safety
of
navigation
in
that
sea
this
joint
participation
in
establishments
interesting
to
humanity
and
beneficial
to
commerce
is
worthy
of
two
enlightened
nations
and
indicates
feelings
which
can
not
fail
to
have
a
happy
influence
upon
their
political
relations
it
is
gratifying
to
the
friends
of
both
to
perceive
that
the
intercourse
between
the
two
people
is
becoming
daily
more
extensive
and
that
sentiments
of
mutual
good
will
have
grown
up
befitting
their
common
origin
and
justifying
the
hope
that
by
wise
counsels
on
each
side
not
only
unsettled
questions
may
be
satisfactorily
terminated
but
new
causes
of
misunderstanding
prevented
not
withstanding
that
i
continue
to
receive
the
most
amicable
assurances
from
the
government
of
france
and
that
in
all
other
respects
the
most
friendly
relations
exist
between
the
united
states
and
that
government
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
stipulations
of
the
convention
concluded
on
july
th
remain
in
some
important
parts
unfulfilled
by
the
second
article
of
that
convention
it
was
stipulated
that
the
sum
payable
to
the
united
states
should
be
paid
at
paris
in
six
annual
installments
into
the
hands
of
such
person
or
persons
as
should
be
authorized
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
receive
it
and
by
the
same
article
the
first
installment
was
payable
on
february
d
by
the
act
of
congress
of
july
th
it
was
made
the
duty
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
cause
the
several
installments
with
the
interest
thereon
to
be
received
from
the
french
government
and
transferred
to
the
united
states
in
such
manner
as
he
may
deem
best
and
by
the
same
act
of
congress
the
stipulations
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
in
the
convention
were
in
all
respects
fulfilled
not
doubting
that
a
treaty
thus
made
and
ratified
by
the
two
governments
and
faithfully
executed
by
the
united
states
would
be
promptly
complied
with
by
the
other
party
and
desiring
to
avoid
the
risk
and
expense
of
intermediate
agencies
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
deemed
it
advisable
to
receive
and
transfer
the
first
installment
by
means
of
a
draft
upon
the
french
minister
of
finance
a
draft
for
this
purpose
was
accordingly
drawn
in
favor
of
the
cashier
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
for
the
amount
accruing
to
the
united
states
out
of
the
first
installment
and
the
interest
payable
with
it
this
bill
was
not
drawn
at
washington
until
five
days
after
the
installment
was
payable
at
paris
and
was
accompanied
by
a
special
authority
from
the
president
authorizing
the
cashier
or
his
assigns
to
receive
the
amount
the
mode
thus
adopted
of
receiving
the
installment
was
officially
made
known
to
the
french
government
by
the
american
charge
daffaires
at
paris
pursuant
to
instructions
from
the
department
of
state
the
bill
however
though
not
presented
for
payment
until
march
d
was
not
paid
and
for
the
reason
assigned
by
the
french
minister
of
finance
that
no
appropriation
had
been
made
by
the
french
chambers
it
is
not
known
to
me
that
up
to
that
period
any
appropriation
had
been
required
of
the
chambers
and
although
a
communication
was
subsequently
made
to
the
chambers
by
direction
of
the
king
recommending
that
the
necessary
provision
should
be
made
for
carrying
the
convention
into
effect
it
was
at
an
advanced
period
of
the
session
and
the
subject
was
finally
postponed
until
the
next
meeting
of
the
chambers
not
withstanding
it
has
been
supposed
by
the
french
ministry
that
the
financial
stipulations
of
the
treaty
can
not
be
carried
into
effect
without
an
appropriation
by
the
chambers
it
appears
to
me
to
be
not
only
consistent
with
the
character
of
france
but
due
to
the
character
of
both
governments
as
well
as
to
the
rights
of
our
citizens
to
treat
the
convention
made
and
ratified
in
proper
form
as
pledging
the
good
faith
of
the
french
government
for
its
execution
and
as
imposing
upon
each
department
an
obligation
to
fulfill
it
and
i
have
received
assurances
through
our
charge
daffaires
at
paris
and
the
french
minister
plenipotentiary
at
washington
and
more
recently
through
the
minister
of
the
united
states
at
paris
that
the
delay
has
not
proceeded
from
any
indisposition
on
the
part
of
the
king
and
his
ministers
to
fulfill
their
treaty
and
that
measures
will
be
presented
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
chambers
and
with
a
reasonable
hope
of
success
to
obtain
the
necessary
appropriation
it
is
necessary
to
state
however
that
the
documents
except
certain
lists
of
vessels
captured
condemned
or
burnt
at
sea
proper
to
facilitate
the
examination
and
liquidation
of
the
reclamations
comprised
in
the
stipulations
of
the
convention
and
which
by
the
th
article
france
engaged
to
communicate
to
the
united
states
by
the
intermediary
of
the
legation
though
repeatedly
applied
for
by
the
american
charge
daffaires
under
instructions
from
this
government
have
not
yet
been
communicated
and
this
delay
it
is
apprehended
will
necessarily
prevent
the
completion
of
the
duties
assigned
to
the
commissioners
within
the
time
at
present
prescribed
by
law
the
reasons
for
delaying
to
communicate
these
documents
have
not
been
explicitly
stated
and
this
is
the
more
to
be
regretted
as
it
is
not
understood
that
the
interposition
of
the
chambers
is
in
any
manner
required
for
the
delivery
of
those
papers
under
these
circumstances
in
a
case
so
important
to
the
interests
of
our
citizens
and
to
the
character
of
our
country
and
under
disappointments
so
unexpected
i
deemed
it
my
duty
however
i
might
respect
the
general
assurances
to
which
i
have
adverted
no
longer
to
delay
the
appointment
of
a
minister
plenipotentiary
to
paris
but
to
dispatch
him
in
season
to
communicate
the
result
of
his
application
to
the
french
government
at
an
early
period
of
your
session
i
accordingly
appointed
a
distinguished
citizen
for
this
purpose
who
proceeded
on
his
mission
in
august
last
and
was
presented
to
the
king
early
in
the
month
of
october
he
is
particularly
instructed
as
to
all
matters
connected
with
the
present
posture
of
affairs
and
i
indulge
the
hope
that
with
the
representations
he
is
instructed
to
make
and
from
the
disposition
manifested
by
the
king
and
his
ministers
in
their
recent
assurances
to
our
minister
at
paris
the
subject
will
be
early
considered
and
satisfactorily
disposed
of
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
chambers
as
this
subject
involves
important
interests
and
has
attracted
a
considerable
share
of
the
public
attention
i
have
deemed
it
proper
to
make
this
explicit
statement
of
its
actual
condition
and
should
i
be
disappointed
in
the
hope
now
entertained
the
subject
will
be
again
brought
to
the
notice
of
congress
in
such
manner
as
the
occasion
may
require
the
friendly
relations
which
have
always
been
maintained
between
the
united
states
and
russia
have
been
further
extended
and
strengthened
by
the
treaty
of
navigation
and
commerce
concluded
on
december
th
and
sanctioned
by
the
senate
before
the
close
of
its
last
session
the
ratifications
having
been
since
exchanged
the
liberal
provisions
of
the
treaty
are
now
in
full
force
and
under
the
encouragement
which
they
have
secured
a
flourishing
and
increasing
commerce
yielding
its
benefits
to
the
enterprise
of
both
nations
affords
to
each
the
just
recompense
of
wise
measures
and
adds
new
motives
for
that
mutual
friendship
which
the
two
countries
have
hitherto
cherished
toward
each
other
it
affords
me
peculiar
satisfaction
to
state
that
the
government
of
spain
has
at
length
yielded
to
the
justice
of
the
claims
which
have
been
so
long
urged
in
behalf
of
our
citizens
and
has
expressed
a
willingness
to
provide
an
indemnification
as
soon
as
the
proper
amount
can
be
agreed
upon
upon
this
latter
point
it
is
probable
an
understanding
had
taken
place
between
the
minister
of
the
united
states
and
the
spanish
government
before
the
decease
of
the
late
king
of
spain
and
unless
that
event
may
have
delayed
its
completion
there
is
rea
son
to
hope
that
it
may
be
in
my
power
to
announce
to
you
early
in
your
present
session
the
conclusion
of
a
convention
upon
terms
not
less
favorable
than
those
entered
into
for
similar
objects
with
other
nations
that
act
of
justice
would
well
accord
with
the
character
of
spain
and
is
due
to
the
united
states
from
their
ancient
friend
it
could
not
fail
to
strengthen
the
sentiments
of
amity
and
good
will
between
the
two
nations
which
it
is
so
much
the
wish
of
the
united
states
to
cherish
and
so
truly
the
interest
of
both
to
maintain
by
the
first
section
of
an
act
of
congress
passed
on
july
th
the
tonnage
duty
on
spanish
ships
arriving
from
the
ports
of
spain
previous
to
october
th
being
five
cents
per
ton
that
act
was
intended
to
give
effect
on
our
side
to
an
arrangement
made
with
the
spanish
government
by
which
discriminating
duties
of
tonnage
were
to
be
abolished
in
the
ports
of
the
united
states
and
spain
on
he
vessels
of
the
two
nations
pursuant
to
that
arrangement
which
was
carried
into
effect
on
the
part
of
spain
on
may
th
by
a
royal
order
dated
april
th
american
vessels
in
the
ports
of
spain
have
paid
five
cents
per
ton
which
rate
of
duty
is
also
paid
in
those
ports
by
spanish
ships
but
as
american
vessels
pay
no
tonnage
duty
in
the
ports
of
the
united
states
the
duty
of
five
cents
payable
in
our
ports
by
spanish
vessels
under
the
act
above
mentioned
is
really
a
discriminating
duty
operating
to
the
disadvantage
of
spain
though
no
complaint
has
yet
been
made
on
the
part
of
spain
we
are
not
the
less
bound
by
the
obligations
of
good
faith
to
remove
the
discrimination
and
i
recommend
that
the
act
be
amended
accordingly
as
the
royal
order
above
alluded
to
includes
the
ports
of
the
balearic
and
canary
islands
as
well
as
those
of
spain
it
would
seem
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
should
be
equally
extensive
and
that
for
the
repayments
of
such
duties
as
may
have
been
improperly
received
an
addition
should
be
made
to
the
sum
appropriated
at
the
last
session
of
congress
for
refunding
discriminating
duties
as
the
arrangement
referred
to
however
did
not
embrace
the
islands
of
cuba
and
puerto
rico
discriminating
duties
to
the
prejudice
of
american
shipping
continue
to
be
levied
there
from
the
extent
of
the
commerce
carried
on
between
the
united
states
and
those
islands
particularly
the
former
this
discrimination
causes
serious
injury
to
one
of
those
great
national
interests
which
it
has
been
considered
an
essential
part
of
our
policy
to
cherish
and
has
given
rise
to
complaints
on
the
part
of
our
merchants
under
instructions
given
to
our
minister
at
madrid
earnest
representations
have
been
made
by
him
to
the
spanish
government
upon
this
subject
and
there
is
reason
to
expect
from
the
friendly
disposition
which
is
entertained
toward
this
country
that
a
beneficial
change
will
be
produced
the
disadvantage
however
to
which
our
shipping
is
subjected
by
the
operation
of
these
discriminating
duties
requires
that
they
be
met
by
suitable
countervailing
duties
during
your
present
session
power
being
at
the
same
time
vested
in
the
president
to
modify
or
discontinue
them
as
the
discriminating
duties
on
american
vessels
or
their
cargoes
may
be
modified
or
discontinued
at
those
islands
intimations
have
been
given
to
the
spanish
government
that
the
united
states
may
be
obliged
to
resort
to
such
measures
as
are
of
necessary
selfdefense
and
there
is
no
reason
to
apprehend
that
it
would
be
unfavorably
received
the
proposed
proceeding
if
adopted
would
not
be
permitted
however
in
any
degree
to
induce
a
relaxation
in
the
efforts
of
our
minister
to
effect
a
repeal
of
this
irregularity
by
friendly
negotiation
and
it
might
serve
to
give
force
to
his
representations
by
showing
the
dangers
to
which
that
valuable
trade
is
exposed
by
the
obstructions
and
burdens
which
a
system
of
discriminating
and
countervailing
duties
necessarily
produces
the
selection
and
preparation
of
the
florida
archives
for
the
purpose
of
being
delivered
over
to
the
united
states
in
conformity
with
the
royal
order
as
mentioned
in
my
last
annual
message
though
in
progress
has
not
yet
been
completed
this
delay
has
been
produced
partly
by
causes
which
were
unavoidable
particularly
the
prevalence
of
the
cholera
at
havana
but
measures
have
been
taken
which
it
is
believed
will
expedite
the
delivery
of
those
important
records
congress
were
informed
at
the
opening
of
the
last
session
that
owing
as
was
alleged
to
embarrassments
in
the
finances
of
portugal
consequent
upon
the
civil
war
in
which
that
nation
was
engaged
payment
had
been
made
of
only
one
installment
of
the
amount
which
the
portuguese
government
had
stipulated
to
pay
for
indemnifying
our
citizens
for
property
illegally
captured
in
the
blockade
of
terceira
since
that
time
a
postponement
for
two
years
with
interest
of
the
two
remaining
installments
was
requested
by
the
portuguese
government
and
as
a
consideration
it
offered
to
stipulate
that
rice
of
the
united
states
should
be
admitted
into
portugal
at
the
same
duties
as
brazilian
rice
being
satisfied
that
no
better
arrangement
could
be
made
my
consent
was
given
and
a
royal
order
of
the
king
of
portugal
was
accordingly
issued
on
february
th
for
the
reduction
of
the
duty
on
rice
of
the
united
states
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
if
in
speaking
of
that
country
in
whose
prosperity
the
united
states
are
so
much
interested
and
with
whom
a
longsubsisting
extensive
and
mutually
advantageous
commercial
intercourse
has
strengthened
the
relation
of
friendship
i
could
announce
to
you
the
restoration
of
its
internal
tranquillity
subsequently
to
the
commencement
of
the
last
session
of
congress
the
final
installment
payable
by
denmark
under
the
convention
of
march
th
was
received
the
commissioners
for
examining
the
claims
have
since
terminated
their
labors
and
their
awards
have
been
paid
at
the
treasury
as
they
have
been
called
for
the
justice
rendered
to
our
citizens
by
that
government
is
thus
completed
and
a
pledge
is
thereby
afforded
for
the
maintenance
of
that
friendly
intercourse
becoming
the
relations
that
the
two
nations
mutually
bear
to
each
other
it
is
satisfactory
to
inform
you
that
the
danish
government
have
recently
issued
an
ordinance
by
which
the
commerce
with
the
island
of
st
croix
is
placed
on
a
more
liberal
footing
than
heretofore
this
change
can
not
fail
to
prove
beneficial
to
the
trade
between
the
united
states
and
that
colony
and
the
advantages
likely
to
flow
from
it
may
lead
to
greater
relaxations
in
the
colonial
systems
of
other
nations
the
ratifications
of
the
convention
with
the
king
of
the
two
sicilies
have
been
duly
exchanged
and
the
commissioners
appointed
for
examining
the
claims
under
it
have
entered
upon
the
duties
assigned
to
them
by
law
the
friendship
that
the
interests
of
the
two
nations
require
of
them
being
now
established
it
may
be
hoped
that
each
will
enjoy
the
benefits
which
a
liberal
commerce
should
yield
to
both
a
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
between
the
united
states
and
belgium
was
concluded
during
the
last
winter
and
received
the
sanction
of
the
senate
but
the
exchange
of
the
ratifications
has
been
hitherto
delayed
in
consequence
in
the
first
instance
of
some
delay
in
the
reception
of
the
treaty
at
brussels
and
subsequently
of
the
absence
of
the
belgian
minister
of
foreign
affairs
at
the
important
conferences
in
which
his
government
is
engaged
at
london
that
treaty
does
but
embody
those
enlarged
principles
of
friendly
policy
which
it
is
sincerely
hoped
will
always
regulate
the
conduct
of
the
two
nations
having
such
strong
motives
to
maintain
amicable
relations
toward
each
other
and
so
sincerely
desirous
to
cherish
them
with
all
the
other
european
powers
with
whom
the
united
states
have
formed
diplomatic
relations
and
with
the
sublime
porte
the
best
understanding
prevails
from
all
i
continue
to
receive
assurances
of
good
will
toward
the
united
statesassurances
which
it
gives
me
no
less
pleasure
to
reciprocate
than
to
receive
with
all
the
engagements
which
have
been
entered
into
are
fulfilled
with
good
faith
on
both
sides
measures
have
also
been
taken
to
enlarge
our
friendly
relations
and
extend
our
commercial
intercourse
with
other
states
the
system
we
have
pursued
of
aiming
at
no
exclusive
advantages
of
dealing
with
all
on
terms
of
fair
and
equal
reciprocity
and
of
adhering
scrupulously
to
all
our
engagements
is
well
calculated
to
give
success
to
efforts
intended
to
be
mutually
beneficial
the
wars
of
which
the
southern
part
of
this
continent
was
so
long
the
theater
and
which
were
carried
on
either
by
the
mother
country
against
the
states
which
had
formerly
been
her
colonies
or
by
the
states
against
each
other
having
terminated
and
their
civil
dissensions
having
so
far
subsided
as
with
few
exceptions
no
longer
to
disturb
the
public
tranquillity
it
is
earnestly
hoped
those
states
will
be
able
to
employ
themselves
without
interruption
in
perfecting
their
institutions
cultivating
the
arts
of
peace
and
promoting
by
wise
councils
and
able
exertions
the
public
and
private
prosperity
which
their
patriotic
struggles
so
well
entitle
them
to
enjoy
with
those
states
our
relations
have
undergone
but
little
change
during
the
present
year
no
reunion
having
yet
taken
place
between
the
states
which
composed
the
republic
of
colombia
our
charge
daffaires
at
bogota
has
been
accredited
to
the
government
of
new
grenada
and
we
have
therefore
no
diplomatic
relations
with
venezuela
and
equator
except
as
they
may
be
included
in
those
heretofore
formed
with
the
colombian
republic
it
is
understood
that
representatives
from
the
three
states
were
about
to
assemble
at
bogota
to
confer
on
the
subject
of
their
mutual
interests
particularly
that
of
their
union
and
if
the
result
should
render
it
necessary
measures
will
be
taken
on
our
part
to
preserve
with
each
that
friendship
and
those
liberal
commercial
connections
which
it
has
been
the
constant
desire
of
the
united
states
to
cultivate
with
their
sister
republics
of
this
hemisphere
until
the
important
question

of
reunion
shall
be
settled
however
the
different
matters
which
have
been
under
discussion
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
colombia
or
either
of
the
states
which
composed
it
are
not
likely
to
be
brought
to
a
satisfactory
issue
in
consequence
of
the
illness
of
the
charge
daffaires
appointed
to
central
america
at
the
last
session
of
congress
he
was
prevented
from
proceeding
on
his
mission
until
the
month
of
october
it
is
hoped
however
that
he
is
by
this
time
at
his
post
and
that
the
official
intercourse
unfortunately
so
long
interrupted
has
been
thus
renewed
on
the
part
of
the
two
nations
so
amicably
and
advantageously
connected
by
engagements
founded
on
the
most
enlarged
principles
of
commercial
reciprocity
it
is
gratifying
to
state
that
since
my
last
annual
message
some
of
the
most
important
claims
of
our
fellow
citizens
upon
the
government
of
brazil
have
been
satisfactorily
adjusted
and
a
reliance
is
placed
on
the
friendly
dispositions
manifested
by
it
that
justice
will
also
be
done
in
others
no
new
causes
of
complaint
have
arisen
and
the
trade
between
the
two
countries
flourishes
under
the
encouragement
secured
to
it
by
the
liberal
provisions
of
the
treaty
it
is
cause
of
regret
that
owing
probably
to
the
civil
dissensions
which
have
occupied
the
attention
of
the
mexican
government
the
time
fixed
by
the
treaty
of
limits
with
the
united
states
for
the
meeting
of
the
commissioners
to
define
the
boundaries
between
the
two
nations
has
been
suffered
to
expire
without
the
appointment
of
any
commissioners
on
the
part
of
that
government
while
the
true
boundary
remains
in
doubt
by
either
party
it
is
difficult
to
give
effect
to
those
measures
which
are
necessary
to
the
protection
and
quiet
of
our
numerous
citizens
residing
near
that
frontier
the
subject
is
one
of
great
solicitude
to
the
united
states
and
will
not
fail
to
receive
my
earnest
attention
the
treaty
concluded
with
chili
and
approved
by
the
senate
at
its
last
session
was
also
ratified
by
the
chilian
government
but
with
certain
additional
and
explanatory
articles
of
a
nature
to
have
required
it
to
be
again
submitted
to
the
senate
the
time
limited
for
the
exchange
of
the
ratification
however
having
since
expired
the
action
of
both
governments
on
the
treaty
will
again
become
necessary
the
negotiations
commenced
with
the
argentine
republic
relative
to
the
outrages
committed
on
our
vessels
engaged
in
the
fisheries
at
the
falkland
islands
by
persons
acting
under
the
color
of
its
authority
as
well
as
the
other
matters
in
controversy
between
the
two
governments
have
been
suspended
by
the
departure
of
the
charge
daffaires
of
the
united
states
from
buenos
ayres
it
is
understood
however
that
a
minister
was
subsequently
appointed
by
that
government
to
renew
the
negotiation
in
the
united
states
but
though
daily
expected
he
has
not
yet
arrived
in
this
country
with
peru
no
treaty
has
yet
been
formed
and
with
bolivia
no
diplomatic
intercourse
has
yet
been
established
it
will
be
my
endeavor
to
encourage
those
sentiments
of
amity
and
that
liberal
commerce
which
belong
to
the
relations
in
which
all
the
independent
states
of
this
continent
stand
toward
each
other
i
deem
it
proper
to
recommend
to
your
notice
the
revision
of
our
consular
system
this
has
become
an
important
branch
of
the
public
service
in
as
much
as
it
is
intimately
connected
with
the
preservation
of
our
national
character
abroad
with
the
interest
of
our
citizens
in
foreign
countries
with
the
regulation
and
care
of
our
commerce
and
with
the
protection
of
our
sea
men
at
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
congress
i
communicated
a
report
from
the
secretary
of
state
upon
the
subject
to
which
i
now
refer
as
containing
information
which
may
be
useful
in
any
inquiries
that
congress
may
see
fit
to
institute
with
a
view
to
a
salutary
reform
of
the
system
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
congratulate
you
upon
the
prosperous
condition
of
the
finances
of
the
country
as
will
appear
from
the
report
which
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
in
due
time
lay
before
you
the
receipts
into
the
treasury
during
the
present
year
will
amount
to
more
than
the
revenue
derived
from
customs
will
it
is
believed
be
more
than
and
the
public
lands
will
yield
about
the
expenditures
within
the
year
for
all
objects
including
on
account
of
the
public
debt
will
not
amount
to
and
a
large
balance
will
remain
in
the
treasury
after
satisfying
all
the
appropriations
chargeable
on
the
revenue
for
the
present
year
the
measures
taken
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
probably
enable
to
pay
off
in
the
course
of
the
present
year
the
residue
of
the
exchanged
stock
redeemable
on
january
st
it
has
therefore
been
included
in
the
estimated
expenditures
of
this
year
and
forms
a
part
of
the
sum
above
stated
to
have
been
paid
on
account
of
the
public
debt
the
payment
of
this
stock
will
reduce
the
whole
debt
of
the
united
states
funded
and
unfunded
to
the
sum
of
and
as
provision
has
already
been
made
for
the
stocks
above
mentioned
and
charged
in
the
expenses
of
the
present
year
the
sum
last
stated
is
all
that
now
remains
of
the
national
debt
and
the
revenue
of
the
coming
year
together
with
the
balance
now
in
the
treasury
will
be
sufficient
to
discharge
it
after
meeting
the
current
expenses
of
the
government
under
the
power
given
to
the
commissioners
of
the
sinking
fund
it
will
i
have
no
doubt
be
purchased
on
favorable
terms
within
the
year
from
this
view
of
the
state
of
the
finances
and
the
public
engagements
yet
to
be
fulfilled
you
will
perceive
that
if
providence
permits
me
to
meet
you
at
another
session
i
shall
have
the
high
gratification
of
announcing
to
you
that
the
national
debt
is
extinguished
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
pleasure
i
feel
at
the
near
approach
of
that
desirable
event
the
short
period
of
time
within
which
the
public
debt
will
have
been
discharged
is
strong
evidence
of
the
abundant
resources
of
the
country
and
of
the
prudence
and
economy
with
which
the
government
has
heretofore
been
administered
we
have
waged
two
wars
since
we
became
a
nation
with
one
of
the
most
powerful
kingdoms
in
the
world
both
of
them
undertaken
in
defense
of
our
dearest
rights
been
successfully
prosecuted
and
honorably
terminated
and
many
of
those
who
partook
in
the
first
struggle
as
well
as
in
the
second
will
have
lived
to
see
the
last
item
of
the
debt
incurred
in
these
necessary
but
expensive
conflicts
faithfully
and
honestly
discharged
and
we
shall
have
the
proud
satisfaction
of
bequeathing
to
the
public
servants
who
follow
us
in
the
administration
of
the
government
the
rare
blessing
of
a
revenue
sufficiently
abundant
raised
without
injustice
or
oppression
to
our
citizens
and
unencumbered
with
any
burdens
but
what
they
themselves
shall
think
proper
to
impose
upon
it
the
flourishing
state
of
the
finances
ought
not
however
to
encourage
us
to
indulge
in
a
lavish
expenditure
of
the
public
treasure
the
receipts
of
the
present
year
do
not
furnish
the
test
by
which
we
are
to
estimate
the
income
of
the
next
the
changes
made
in
our
revenue
system
by
the
acts
of
congress
of
and
and
more
especially
by
the
former
have
swelled
the
receipts
of
the
present
year
far
beyond
the
amount
to
be
expected
in
future
years
upon
the
reduced
tariff
of
duties
the
shortened
credits
on
revenue
bonds
and
the
cash
duties
on
woolens
which
were
introduced
by
the
act
of
and
took
effect
on
march
th
have
brought
large
sums
into
the
treasury
in
which
according
to
the
credits
formerly
given
would
not
have
been
payable
until
and
would
have
formed
a
part
of
the
income
of
that
year
these
causes
would
of
themselves
produce
a
great
diminution
of
the
receipts
in
the
year
as
compared
with
the
present
one
and
they
will
be
still
more
diminished
by
the
reduced
rates
of
duties
which
take
place
on
january
st
on
some
of
the
most
important
and
productive
articles
upon
the
best
estimates
that
can
be
made
the
receipts
of
the
next
year
with
the
aid
of
the
unappropriated
amount
now
in
the
treasury
will
not
be
much
more
than
sufficient
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
year
and
pay
the
small
remnant
of
the
national
debt
which
yet
remains
unsatisfied
i
can
not
therefore
recommend
to
you
any
alteration
in
the
present
tariff
of
duties
the
rate
as
now
fixed
by
law
on
the
various
articles
was
adopted
at
the
last
session
of
congress
as
a
matter
of
compromise
with
unusual
unanimity
and
unless
it
is
found
to
produce
more
than
the
necessities
of
the
government
call
for
there
would
seem
to
be
no
reason
at
this
time
to
justify
a
change
but
while
i
forbear
to
recommend
any
further
reduction
of
the
duties
beyond
that
already
provided
for
by
the
existing
laws
i
must
earnestly
and
respectfully
press
upon
congress
the
importance
of
abstaining
from
all
appropriations
which
are
not
absolutely
required
for
the
public
interest
and
authorized
by
the
powers
clearly
delegated
to
the
united
states
we
are
beginning
a
new
era
in
our
government
the
national
debt
which
has
so
long
been
a
burden
on
the
treasury
will
be
finally
discharged
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
year
no
more
memory
will
afterwards
be
needed
than
what
may
be
necessary
to
meet
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
now
then
is
the
proper
moment
to
fix
our
system
of
expenditure
on
firm
and
durable
principles
and
i
can
not
too
strongly
urge
the
necessity
of
a
rigid
economy
and
an
inflexible
determination
not
to
enlarge
the
income
beyond
the
real
necessities
of
the
government
and
not
to
increase
the
wants
of
the
government
by
unnecessary
and
profuse
expenditures
if
a
contrary
course
should
be
pursued
it
may
happen
that
the
revenue
of
will
fall
short
of
the
demands
upon
it
and
after
reducing
the
tariff
in
order
to
lighten
the
burdens
of
the
people
and
providing
for
a
still
further
reduction
to
take
effect
hereafter
it
would
be
much
to
be
deplored
if
at
the
end
of
another
year
we
should
find
ourselves
obliged
to
retrace
our
steps
and
impose
additional
taxes
to
meet
unnecessary
expenditures
it
is
my
duty
on
this
occasion
to
call
your
attention
to
the
destruction
of
the
public
bu
ilding
occupied
by
the
treasury
department
which
happened
since
the
last
adjournment
of
congress
a
thorough
inquiry
into
the
causes
of
this
loss
was
directed
and
made
at
the
time
the
result
of
which
will
be
duly
communicated
to
you
i
take
pleasure
however
in
stating
here
that
by
the
laudable
exertions
of
the
officers
of
the
department
and
many
of
the
citizens
of
the
district
but
few
papers
were
lost
and
none
that
will
materially
affect
the
public
interest
the
public
convenience
requires
that
another
building
should
be
erected
as
soon
as
practicable
and
in
providing
for
it
it
will
be
advisable
to
enlarge
in
some
manner
the
accommodations
for
the
public
officers
of
the
several
departments
and
to
authorize
the
erection
of
suitable
depositories
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
public
documents
and
records
since
the
last
adjournment
of
congress
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
directed
the
money
of
the
united
states
to
be
deposited
in
certain
state
banks
designated
by
him
and
he
will
immediately
lay
before
you
his
reasons
for
this
direction
i
concur
with
him
entirely
in
the
view
he
has
taken
on
the
subject
and
some
months
before
the
removal
i
urged
upon
the
department
the
propriety
of
taking
that
step
the
near
approach
of
the
day
on
which
the
charger
will
expire
as
well
as
the
conduct
of
the
bank
appeared
to
me
to
call
for
this
measure
upon
the
high
considerations
of
public
interest
and
public
duty
the
extent
of
its
misconduct
however
although
known
to
be
great
was
not
at
that
time
fully
developed
by
proof
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
month
of
august
that
i
received
from
the
government
directors
an
official
report
establishing
beyond
question
that
this
great
and
powerful
institution
had
been
actively
engaged
in
attempting
to
influence
the
elections
of
the
public
officers
by
means
of
its
money
and
that
in
violation
of
the
express
provisions
of
its
charter
it
had
by
a
formal
resolution
placed
its
funds
at
the
disposition
of
its
president
to
be
employed
in
sustaining
the
political
power
of
the
bank
a
copy
of
this
resolution
is
contained
in
the
report
of
the
government
directors
before
referred
to
and
how
ever
the
object
may
be
disguised
by
cautious
language
no
one
can
doubt
that
this
money
was
in
truth
intended
for
electioneering
purposes
and
the
particular
uses
to
which
it
was
proved
to
have
been
applied
abundantly
show
that
it
was
so
understood
not
only
was
the
evidence
complete
as
to
the
past
application
of
the
money
and
power
of
the
bank
to
electioneering
purposes
but
that
the
resolution
of
the
board
of
directors
authorized
the
same
course
to
be
pursued
in
future
it
being
thus
established
by
unquestionable
proof
that
the
bank
of
the
united
states
was
converted
into
a
permanent
electioneering
engine
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
path
of
duty
which
the
executive
department
of
the
government
ought
to
pursue
was
not
doubtful
as
by
the
terms
of
the
bank
charter
no
officer
but
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
could
remove
the
deposits
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
authority
ought
to
be
at
once
exerted
to
deprive
that
great
corporation
of
the
support
and
countenance
of
the
government
in
such
an
use
of
its
and
such
an
exertion
of
its
power
in
this
point
of
the
case
the
question
is
distinctly
presented
whether
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
to
govern
through
representatives
chosen
by
their
unbiased
suffrages
or
whether
the
money
and
power
of
a
great
corporation
are
to
be
secretly
exerted
to
influence
their
judgment
and
control
their
decisions
it
must
now
be
determined
whether
the
bank
is
to
have
its
candidates
for
all
offices
in
the
country
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
or
whether
candidates
on
both
sides
of
political
questions
shall
be
brought
forward
as
heretofore
and
supported
by
the
usual
means
at
this
time
the
efforts
of
the
bank
to
control
public
opinion
through
the
distresses
of
some
and
the
fears
of
others
are
equally
apparent
and
if
possible
more
objectionable
by
a
curtailment
of
its
accommodations
more
rapid
than
any
emergency
requires
and
even
while
it
retains
specie
to
an
almost
unprecedented
amount
in
its
vaults
it
is
attempting
to
produce
great
embarrassment
in
one
portion
of
the
community
while
through
presses
known
to
have
been
sustained
by
its
money
it
attempts
by
unfounded
alarms
to
create
a
panic
in
all
these
are
the
means
by
which
it
seems
to
expect
that
it
can
force
a
restoration
of
the
deposits
and
as
a
necessary
consequence
extort
from
congress
a
renewal
of
its
charter
i
am
happy
to
know
that
through
the
good
sense
of
our
people
the
effort
to
get
up
a
panic
has
hitherto
failed
and
that
through
the
increased
accommodations
which
the
state
banks
have
been
enabled
to
afford
no
public
distress
has
followed
the
exertions
of
the
bank
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
exercise
of
its
power
and
the
expenditure
of
its
money
as
well
as
its
efforts
to
spread
groundless
alarm
will
be
met
and
rebuked
as
they
deserve
in
my
own
sphere
of
duty
i
should
feel
myself
called
on
by
the
facts
disclosed
to
order
a
scire
facias
against
the
bank
with
a
view
to
put
an
end
to
the
chartered
rights
it
has
so
palpably
violated
were
it
not
that
the
charter
itself
will
expire
as
soon
as
a
decision
would
probably
be
obtained
from
the
court
of
last
resort
i
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
this
subject
in
my
last
annual
message
and
informed
them
that
such
measures
as
were
within
the
reach
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
been
taken
to
enable
him
to
judge
whether
the
public
deposits
in
the
bank
of
the
united
states
were
entirely
safe
but
that
as
his
single
powers
might
be
inadequate
to
the
object
i
recommended
the
subject
to
congress
as
worthy
of
their
serious
investigation
declaring
it
as
my
opinion
that
an
inquiry
into
the
transactions
of
that
institution
embracing
the
branches
as
well
as
the
principal
bank
was
called
for
by
the
credit
which
was
given
throughout
the
country
to
many
serious
charges
impeaching
their
character
and
which
if
true
might
justly
excite
the
apprehension
that
they
were
no
longer
a
safe
depository
for
the
public
money
the
extent
to
which
the
examination
thus
recommended
was
gone
into
is
spread
upon
your
journals
and
is
too
well
known
to
require
to
be
stated
such
as
was
made
resulted
in
a
report
from
a
majority
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
touching
certain
specified
points
only
concluding
with
a
resolution
that
the
government
deposits
might
safely
be
continued
in
the
bank
of
the
united
states
this
resolution
was
adopted
at
the
close
of
the
session
by
the
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
house
of
representatives
although
i
may
not
always
be
able
to
concur
in
the
views
of
the
public
interest
or
the
duties
of
its
agents
which
may
be
taken
by
the
other
departments
of
the
government
or
either
of
its
branches
i
am
not
withstanding
wholly
incapable
of
receiving
otherwise
than
with
the
most
sincere
respect
all
opinions
or
suggestions
proceeding
from
such
a
source
and
in
respect
to
none
am
i
more
inclined
to
do
so
than
to
the
house
of
representatives
but
it
will
be
seen
from
the
brief
views
at
this
time
taken
of
the
subject
by
myself
as
well
as
the
more
ample
ones
presented
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
the
change
in
the
deposits
which
has
been
ordered
has
been
deemed
to
be
called
for
by
considerations
which
are
not
affected
by
the
proceedings
referred
to
and
which
if
correctly
viewed
by
that
department
rendered
its
act
a
matter
of
imperious
duty
coming
as
you
do
for
the
most
part
immediately
from
the
people
and
the
states
by
election
and
possessing
the
fullest
opportunity
to
know
their
sentiments
the
present
congress
will
be
sincerely
solicitous
to
carry
into
full
and
fair
effect
the
will
of
their
constituents
in
regard
to
this
institution
it
will
be
for
those
in
whose
behalf
we
all
act
to
decide
whether
the
executive
department
of
the
government
in
the
steps
which
it
has
taken
on
this
subject
has
been
found
in
the
line
of
its
duty
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
with
the
documents
annexed
to
it
exhibits
the
operations
of
the
war
department
for
the
past
year
and
the
condition
of
the
various
subjects
intrusted
to
its
administration
it
will
be
seen
from
them
that
the
army
maintains
the
character
it
has
heretofore
acquired
for
efficiency
and
military
knowledge
nothing
has
occurred
since
your
last
session
to
require
its
services
beyond
the
ordinary
routine
duties
which
upon
the
seaboard
and
the
inland
frontier
devolve
upon
it
in
a
time
of
peace
the
system
so
wisely
adopted
and
so
long
pursued
of
constructing
fortifications
at
exposed
points
and
of
preparing
and
collecting
the
supplies
necessary
for
the
military
defense
of
the
country
and
thus
providently
furnishing
in
peace
the
means
of
defense
in
war
has
been
continued
with
the
usual
results
i
recommend
to
your
consideration
the
various
subjects
suggested
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
their
adoption
would
promote
the
public
service
and
meliorate
the
condition
of
the
army
our
relations
with
the
various
indian
tribes
have
been
undisturbed
since
the
termination
of
the
difficulties
growing
out
of
the
hostile
aggressions
of
the
sac
and
fox
indians
several
treaties
have
been
formed
for
the
relinquishment
of
territory
to
the
united
states
and
for
the
migration
of
the
occupants
of
the
region
assigned
for
their
residence
west
of
the
mississippi
should
these
treaties
be
ratified
by
the
senate
provision
will
have
been
made
for
the
removal
of
almost
all
the
tribes
remaining
e
of
that
river
and
for
the
termination
of
many
difficult
and
embarrassing
questions
arising
out
of
their
anomalous
political
condition
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
those
portions
of
two
of
the
southern
tribes
which
in
that
event
will
present
the
only
remaining
difficulties
will
realize
the
necessity
of
emigration
and
will
speedily
resort
to
it
my
original
convictions
upon
this
subject
have
been
confirmed
by
the
course
of
events
for
several
years
and
experience
is
every
day
adding
to
their
strength
that
those
tribes
can
not
exist
surrounded
by
our
settlements
and
in
continual
contact
with

our
citizens
is
certain
they
have
neither
the
intelligence
the
industry
the
moral
habits
nor
the
desire
of
improvement
which
are
essential
to
any
favorable
change
in
their
condition
established
in
the
midst
of
another
and
a
superior
race
and
without
appreciating
the
causes
of
their
inferiority
or
seeking
to
control
them
they
must
necessarily
yield
to
the
force
of
circumstances
and
ere
long
disappear
such
has
been
their
fate
heretofore
and
if
it
is
to
be
avertedand
it
isit
can
only
be
done
by
a
general
removal
beyond
our
boundary
and
by
the
reorganization
of
their
political
system
upon
principles
adapted
to
the
new
relations
in
which
they
will
be
placed
the
experiment
which
has
been
recently
made
has
so
far
proved
successful
the
emigrants
generally
are
represented
to
be
prosperous
and
contented
the
country
suitable
to
their
wants
and
habits
and
the
essential
articles
of
subsistence
easily
procured
when
the
report
of
the
commissioners
now
engaged
in
investigating
the
condition
and
prospects
of
these
indians
and
in
devising
a
plan
for
their
intercourse
and
government
is
received
i
trust
ample
means
of
information
will
be
in
possession
of
the
government
for
adjusting
all
the
unsettled
questions
connected
with
this
interesting
subject
the
operations
of
the
navy
during
the
year
and
its
present
condition
are
fully
exhibited
in
the
annual
report
from
the
navy
department
suggestions
are
made
by
the
secretary
of
various
improvements
which
deserve
careful
consideration
and
most
of
which
if
adopted
bid
fair
to
promote
the
efficiency
of
this
important
branch
of
the
public
service
among
these
are
the
new
organization
of
the
navy
board
the
revision
of
the
pay
to
officers
and
a
change
in
the
period
of
time
or
in
the
manner
of
making
the
annual
appropriations
to
which
i
beg
leave
to
call
your
particular
attention
the
views
which
are
presented
on
almost
every
portion
of
our
naval
concerns
and
especially
on
the
amount
of
force
and
the
number
of
officers
and
the
general
course
of
policy
appropriate
in
the
present
state
of
our
country
for
securing
the
great
and
useful
purposes
of
naval
protection
in
peace
and
due
preparation
for
the
contingencies
of
war
meet
with
my
entire
approbation
it
will
be
perceived
from
the
report
referred
to
that
the
fiscal
concerns
of
the
establishment
are
in
an
excellent
condition
and
it
is
hoped
that
congress
may
feel
disposed
to
make
promptly
every
suitable
provision
desired
either
for
preserving
or
improving
the
system
the
general
post
office
department
has
continued
upon
the
strength
of
its
own
resources
to
facilitate
the
means
of
communication
between
the
various
portions
of
the
union
with
increased
activity
the
method
however
in
which
the
accounts
of
the
transportation
of
the
mail
have
always
been
kept
appears
to
have
presented
an
imperfect
view
of
its
expenses
it
has
recently
been
discovered
that
from
the
earliest
records
of
the
department
the
annual
statements
have
been
calculated
to
exhibit
an
amount
considerably
short
of
the
actual
expense
incurred
for
that
service
these
illusory
statements
together
with
the
expense
of
carrying
into
effect
the
law
of
the
last
session
of
congress
establishing
new
mail
routes
and
a
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
head
of
the
department
to
gratify
the
wishes
of
the
public
in
the
extension
of
mail
facilities
have
induced
him
to
incur
responsibilities
for
their
improvement
beyond
what
the
current
resources
of
the
department
would
sustain
as
soon
as
he
had
discovered
the
imperfection
of
the
method
he
caused
an
investigation
to
be
made
of
its
results
and
applied
the
proper
remedy
to
correct
the
evil
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
withdraw
some
of
the
improvements
which
he
had
made
to
bring
the
expenses
of
the
department
within
its
own
resources
these
expenses
were
incurred
for
the
public
good
and
the
public
have
enjoyed
their
benefit
they
are
now
but
partially
suspended
and
that
where
they
may
be
discontinued
with
the
least
inconvenience
to
the
country
the
progressive
increase
in
the
income
from
postages
has
equaled
the
highest
expectations
and
it
affords
demonstrative
evidence
of
the
growing
importance
and
great
utility
of
this
department
the
details
are
exhibited
in
the
accompanying
report
of
the
post
master
general
the
many
distressing
accidents
which
have
of
late
occurred
in
that
portion
of
our
navigation
carried
on
by
the
use
of
steam
power
deserve
the
immediate
and
unremitting
attention
of
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
country
the
fact
that
the
number
of
those
fatal
disasters
is
constantly
increasing
not
withstanding
the
great
improvements
which
are
every
where
made
in
the
machinery
employed
and
in
the
rapid
advances
which
have
made
in
that
branch
of
science
shows
very
clearly
that
they
are
in
a
great
degree
the
result
of
criminal
negligence
on
the
part
of
those
by
whom
the
vessels
are
navigated
and
to
whose
care
and
attention
the
lives
and
property
of
our
citizens
are
so
extensively
intrusted
that
these
evils
may
be
greatly
lessened
if
not
substantially
removed
by
means
of
precautionary
and
penal
legislation
seems
to
be
highly
probably
so
far
therefore
as
the
subject
can
be
regarded
as
within
the
constitutional
purview
of
congress
i
earnestly
recommend
it
to
your
prompt
and
serious
consideration
i
would
also
call
your
attention
to
the
views
i
have
heretofore
expressed
of
the
propriety
of
amending
the
constitution
in
relation
to
the
mode
of
electing
the
president
and
the
vicepresident
of
the
united
states
regarding
it
as
all
important
to
the
future
quiet
and
harmony
of
the
people
that
every
intermediate
agency
in
the
election
of
these
officers
should
be
removed
and
that
their
eligibility
should
be
limited
to
one
term
of
either
four
or
six
years
i
can
not
too
earnestly
invite
your
consideration
of
the
subject
trusting
that
your
deliberations
on
all
the
topics
of
general
interest
to
which
i
have
adverted
and
such
others
as
your
more
extensive
knowledge
of
the
wants
of
our
beloved
country
may
suggest
may
be
crowned
with
success
i
tender
you
in
conclusion
the
cooperation
which
it
may
be
in
my
power
to
afford
them

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
return
to
the
seat
of
government
for
the
purpose
of
discharging
your
duties
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
although
the
pestilence
which
had
traversed
the
old
world
has
entered
our
limits
and
extended
its
ravages
over
much
of
our
land
it
has
pleased
almighty
god
to
mitigate
its
severity
and
lessen
the
number
of
its
victims
compared
with
those
who
have
fallen
in
most
other
countries
over
which
it
has
spread
its
terrors
not
with
standing
this
visitation
our
country
presents
on
every
side
marks
of
prosperity
and
happiness
unequaled
perhaps
in
any
other
portion
of
the
world
if
we
fully
appreciate
our
comparative
condition
existing
causes
of
discontent
will
appear
unworthy
of
attention
and
with
hearts
of
thankfulness
to
that
divine
being
who
has
filled
our
cup
of
prosperity
we
shall
feel
our
resolution
strengthened
to
preserve
and
hand
down
to
our
posterity
that
liberty
and
that
union
which
we
have
received
from
our
fathers
and
which
constitute
the
sources
and
the
shield
of
all
our
blessings
the
relations
of
our
country
continue
to
present
the
same
picture
of
amicable
intercourse
that
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
hold
up
to
your
view
at
the
opening
of
your
last
session
the
same
friendly
professions
the
same
desire
to
participate
in
our
flourishing
commerce
the
same
dispositions
evinced
by
all
nations
with
whom
we
have
any
intercourse
this
desirable
state
of
things
may
be
mainly
ascribed
to
our
undeviating
practice
of
the
rule
which
has
long
guided
our
national
policy
to
require
no
exclusive
privileges
in
commerce
and
to
grant
none
it
is
daily
producing
its
beneficial
effect
in
the
respect
shown
to
our
flag
the
protection
of
our
citizens
and
their
property
abroad
and
in
the
increase
of
our
navigation
and
the
extension
of
our
mercantile
operations
the
returns
which
have
been
made
out
since
we
last
met
will
show
an
increase
during
the
last
preceding
year
of
more
than
thousand
tons
in
our
shipping
and
of
near
in
the
aggregate
of
our
imports
and
exports
nor
have
we
less
reason
to
felicitate
ourselves
on
the
position
of
our
political
than
of
our
commercial
concerns
they
remain
in
the
state
in
which
they
were
when
i
last
addressed
youa
state
of
prosperity
and
peace
the
effect
of
a
wise
attention
to
the
parting
advice
of
the
revered
father
of
his
country
on
this
subject
condensed
into
a
maxim
for
the
use
of
posterity
by
one
of
his
most
distinguished
successorsto
cultivate
free
commerce
and
honest
friendship
with
all
nations
but
to
make
entangling
alliances
with
none
a
strict
adherence
to
this
policy
has
kept
us
aloof
from
the
perplexing
questions
that
now
agitate
the
european
world
and
have
more
than
once
deluged
those
countries
with
blood
should
those
scenes
unfortunately
recur
the
parties
to
the
contest
may
count
on
a
faithful
performance
of
the
duties
incumbent
on
us
as
a
neutral
nation
and
our
own
citizens
may
equally
rely
on
the
firm
assertion
of
their
neutral
rights
with
the
nation
that
was
our
earliest
friend
and
ally
in
the
infancy
of
our
political
existence
the
most
friendly
relations
have
subsisted
through
the
late
revolutions
of
its
government
and
from
the
events
of
the
last
promise
a
permanent
duration
it
has
made
an
approximation
in
some
of
its
political
institutions
to
our
own
and
raised
a
monarch
to
the
throne
who
preserves
it
is
said
a
friendly
recollection
of
the
period
during
which
he
acquired
among
our
citizens
the
high
consideration
that
could
then
have
been
produced
by
his
personal
qualifications
alone
our
commerce
with
that
nation
is
gradually
assuming
a
mutually
beneficial
character
and
the
adjustment
of
the
claims
of
our
citizens
has
removed
the
only
obstacle
there
was
to
an
intercourse
not
only
lucrative
but
productive
of
literary
and
scientific
improvement
from
great
britain
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
inform
you
that
i
continue
to
receive
assurances
of
the
most
amicable
disposition
which
have
on
my
part
on
all
proper
occasions
been
promptly
and
sincerely
reciprocated
the
attention
of
that
government
has
latterly
been
so
much
engrossed
by
matters
of
a
deeply
interesting
domestic
character
that
we
could
not
press
upon
it
the
renewal
of
negotiations
which
had
been
unfortunately
broken
off
by
the
unexpected
recall
of
our
minister
who
had
commenced
them
with
some
hopes
of
success
my
great
object
was
the
settlement
of
questions
which
though
now
dormant
might
hereafter
be
revived
under
circumstances
that
would
endanger
the
good
understanding
which
it
is
the
interest
of
both
parties
to
preserve
inviolate
cemented
as
it
is
by
a
community
of
language
manners
and
social
habits
and
by
the
high
obligations
we
owe
to
our
british
ancestors
for
many
of
our
most
valuable
institutions
and
for
that
system
of
representative
government
which
has
enabled
us
to
preserve
and
improve
them
the
question
of
our
northeast
boundary
still
remains
unsettled
in
my
last
annual
message
i
explained
to
you
the
situation
in
which
i
found
that
business
on
my
coming
into
office
and
the
measures
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
pursue
for
asserting
the
rights
of
the
united
states
before
the
sovereign
who
had
been
chosen
by
my
predecessor
to
determine
the
question
and
also
the
manner
in
which
he
had
disposed
of
it
a
special
message
to
the
senate
in
their
executive
capacity
afterwards
brought
before
them
to
the
question
whether
they
would
advise
a
submission
to
the
opinion
of
the
sovereign
arbiter
that
body
having
considered
the
award
as
not
obligatory
and
advised
me
to
open
a
further
negotiation
the
proposition
was
immediately
made
to
the
british
government
but
the
circumstances
to
which
i
have
alluded
have
hitherto
prevented
any
answer
being
given
to
the
overture
early
attention
however
has
been
promised
to
the
subject
and
every
effort
on
my
part
will
be
made
for
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
this
question
interesting
to
the
union
generally
and
particularly
so
to
one
of
its
members
the
claims
of
our
citizens
on
spain
are
not
yet
acknowledged
on
a
closer
investigation
of
them
than
appears
to
have
heretofore
taken
place
it
was
discovered
that
some
of
these
demands
however
strong
they
might
be
upon
the
equity
of
that
government
were
not
such
as
could
be
made
the
subject
of
national
interference
and
faithful
to
the
principle
of
asking
nothing
but
what
was
clearly
right
additional
instructions
have
been
sent
to
modify
our
demands
so
as
to
embrace
those
only
on
which
according
to
the
laws
of
nations
we
had
a
strict
right
to
insist
an
inevitable
delay
in
procuring
the
documents
necessary
for
this
review
of
the
merits
of
these
claims
retarded
this
operation
until
an
unfortunate
malady
which
has
afflicted
his
catholic
majesty
prevented
an
examination
of
them
being
now
for
the
first
time
presented
in
an
unexceptionable
form
it
is
confidently
hoped
that
the
application
will
be
successful
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
inform
you
that
the
application
i
directed
to
be
made
for
the
delivery
of
a
part
of
the
archives
of
florida
which
had
been
carried
to
the
havannah
has
produced
a
royal
order
for
their
delivery
and
that
measures
have
been
taken
to
procure
its
execution
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
communicated
to
you
on
june
th
you
were
informed
of
the
conditional
reduction
obtained
by
the
minister
of
the
united
states
at
madrid
of
the
duties
on
tonnage
levied
on
american
shipping
in
the
ports
of
spain
the
condition
of
that
reduction
having
been
complied
with
on
our
part
by
the
act
passed
july
th
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
inform
you
that
our
ships
now
pay
no
higher
nor
other
duties
in
the
continental
ports
of
spain
than
are
levied
on
their
national
vessels
the
demands
against
portugal
for
illegal
captures
in
the
blockade
of
terceira
have
been
allowed
to
the
full
amount
of
the
accounts
presented
by
the
claimants
and
payment
was
promised
to
be
made
in
three
installments
the
first
of
these
has
been
paid
the
second
although
due
had
not
at
the
date
of
our
last
advices
been
received
owing
it
was
alleged
to
embarrassments
in
the
finances
consequent
on
the
civil
war
in
which
that
nation
is
engaged
the
payments
stipulated
by
the
convention
with
denmark
have
been
punctually
made
and
the
amount
is
ready
for
distribution
among
the
claimants
as
soon
as
the
board
now
sitting
shall
have
performed
their
functions
i
regret
that
by
the
last
advices
from
our
charge
daffaires
at
naples
that
government
had
still
delayed
the
satisfaction
due
to
our
citizens
but
at
that
date
the
effect
of
the
last
instructions
was
not
known
dispatches
from
thence
are
hourly
expected
and
the
result
will
be
communicated
to
you
without
delay
with
the
rest
of
europe
our
relations
political
and
commercial
remain
unchanged
negotiations
are
going
on
to
put
on
a
permanent
basis
the
liberal
system
of
commerce
now
carried
on
between
us
and
the
empire
of
russia
the
treaty
concluded
with
austria
is
executed
by
his
imperial
majesty
with
the
most
perfect
good
faith
and
as
we
have
no
diplomatic
agent
at
his
court
he
personally
inquired
into
and
corrected
a
proceeding
of
some
of
his
subaltern
officers
to
the
injury
of
our
consul
in
one
of
his
ports
our
treaty
with
the
sublime
porte
is
producing
its
expected
effects
on
our
commerce
new
markets
are
opening
for
our
commodities
and
a
more
extensive
range
for
the
employment
of
our
ships
a
slight
augmentation
of
the
duties
on
our
commerce
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
treaty
had
been
imposed
but
on
the
representation
of
our
charge
daffaires
it
has
been
promptly
withdrawn
and
we
now
enjoy
the
trade
and
navigation
of
the
black
sea
and
of
all
the
ports
belonging
to
the
turkish
empire
and
asia
on
the
most
perfect
equality
with
all
foreign
nations
i
wish
earnestly
that
in
announcing
to
you
the
continuance
of
friendship
and
the
increase
of
a
profitable
commercial
intercourse
with
mexico
with
central
america
and
the
states
of
the
south
i
could
accompany
it
with
the
assurance
that
they
all
are
blessed
with
that
internal
tranquillity
and
foreign
peac
e
which
their
heroic
devotion
to
the
cause
of
their
independence
merits
in
mexico
a
sanguinary
struggle
is
now
carried
on
which
has
caused
some
embarrassment
to
our
commerce
but
both
parties
profess
the
most
friendly
disposition
toward
us
to
the
termination
of
this
contest
we
look
for
the
establishment
of
that
secure
intercourse
so
necessary
to
nations
whose
territories
are
contiguous
how
important
it
will
be
to
us
we
may
calculate
from
the
fact
that
even
in
this
unfavorable
state
of
things
our
maritime
commerce
has
increased
and
an
internal
trade
by
caravans
from
st
louis
to
santa
fe
under
the
protection
of
escorts
furnished
by
the
government
is
carried
on
to
great
advantage
and
is
daily
increasing
the
agents
provided
for
by
the
treaty
with
this
power
to
designate
the
boundaries
which
it
established
have
been
named
on
our
part
but
one
of
the
evils
of
the
civil
war
now
raging
there
has
been
that
the
appointment
of
those
with
whom
they
were
to
cooperate
has
not
yet
been
announced
to
us
the
government
of
central
america
has
expelled
from
its
territory
the
party
which
some
time
since
disturbed
its
peace
desirous
of
fostering
a
favorable
disposition
toward
us
which
has
on
more
than
one
occasion
been
evinced
by
this
interesting
country
i
made
a
second
attempt
in
this
year
to
establish
a
diplomatic
intercourse
with
them
but
the
death
of
the
distinguished
citizen
whom
i
had
appointed
for
that
purpose
has
retarded
the
execution
of
measures
from
which
i
hoped
much
advantage
to
our
commerce
the
union
of
the
three
states
which
formed
the
republic
of
colombia
has
been
dissolved
but
they
all
it
is
believed
consider
themselves
as
separately
bound
by
the
treaty
which
was
made
in
their
federal
capacity
the
minister
accredited
to
the
federation
continues
in
that
character
near
the
government
of
new
grenada
and
hopes
were
entertained
that
a
new
union
would
be
formed
between
the
separate
states
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
foreign
intercourse
our
minister
has
been
instructed
to
use
his
good
offices
when
ever
they
shall
be
desired
to
produce
the
reunion
so
much
to
be
wished
for
the
domestic
tranquillity
of
the
parties
and
the
security
and
facility
of
foreign
commerce
some
agitations
naturally
attendant
on
an
infant
reign
have
prevailed
in
the
empire
of
brazil
which
have
had
the
usual
effect
upon
commercial
operations
and
while
they
suspended
the
consideration
of
claims
created
on
similar
occasions
they
have
given
rise
to
new
complaints
on
the
part
of
our
citizens
a
proper
consideration
for
calamities
and
difficulties
of
this
nature
has
made
us
less
urgent
and
peremptory
in
our
demands
for
justice
than
duty
to
our
fellow
citizens
would
under
other
circumstances
have
required
but
their
claims
are
not
neglected
and
will
on
all
proper
occasions
be
urged
and
it
is
hoped
with
effect
i
refrain
from
making
any
communication
on
the
subject
of
our
affairs
with
buenos
ayres
because
the
negotiation
communicated
to
you
in
my
last
annual
message
was
at
the
date
of
our
last
advices
still
pending
and
in
a
state
that
would
render
a
publication
of
the
details
inexpedient
a
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
has
been
formed
with
the
republic
of
chili
which
if
approved
by
the
senate
will
be
laid
before
you
that
government
seems
to
be
established
and
at
peace
with
its
neighbors
and
its
ports
being
the
resorts
of
our
ships
which
are
employed
in
the
highly
important
trade
of
the
fisheries
this
commercial
convention
can
not
but
be
of
great
advantage
to
our
fellow
citizens
engaged
in
that
perilous
but
profitable
business
our
commerce
with
the
neighboring
state
of
peru
owing
to
the
onerous
duties
levied
on
our
principal
articles
of
export
has
been
on
the
decline
and
all
endeavors
to
procure
an
alteration
have
hitherto
proved
fruitless
with
bolivia
we
have
yet
no
diplomatic
intercourse
and
the
continual
contests
carried
on
between
it
and
peru
have
made
me
defer
until
a
more
favorable
period
the
appointment
of
any
agent
for
that
purpose
an
act
of
atrocious
piracy
having
been
committed
on
one
of
our
trading
ships
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
settlement
on
the
west
coast
of
sumatra
a
frigate
was
dispatched
with
orders
to
demand
satisfaction
for
the
injury
if
those
who
committed
it
should
be
found
to
be
members
of
a
regular
government
capable
of
maintaining
the
usual
relations
with
foreign
nations
but
if
as
it
was
supposed
and
as
they
proved
to
be
they
were
a
band
of
lawless
pirates
to
inflict
such
a
chastisement
as
would
deter
them
and
others
from
like
aggressions
this
last
was
done
and
the
effect
has
been
an
increased
respect
for
our
flag
in
those
distant
seas
and
additional
security
for
our
commerce
in
the
view
i
have
given
of
our
connection
with
foreign
powers
allusions
have
been
made
to
their
domestic
disturbances
or
foreign
wars
to
their
revolutions
or
dissensions
it
may
be
proper
to
observe
that
this
is
done
solely
in
cases
where
those
events
affect
our
political
relations
with
them
or
to
show
their
operation
on
our
commerce
further
than
this
it
is
neither
our
policy
nor
our
right
to
interfere
our
best
wishes
on
all
occasions
our
good
offices
when
required
will
be
afforded
to
promote
the
domestic
tranquillity
and
foreign
peace
of
all
nations
with
whom
we
have
any
intercourse
any
intervention
in
their
affairs
further
than
this
even
by
the
expression
of
an
official
opinion
is
contrary
to
our
principles
of
international
policy
and
will
always
be
avoided
the
report
which
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
in
due
time
lay
before
you
will
exhibit
the
national
finances
in
a
highly
prosperous
state
owing
to
the
continued
success
of
our
commercial
enterprise
which
has
enabled
the
merchants
to
fulfill
their
engagements
with
the
government
the
receipts
from
customs
during
the
year
will
exceed
the
estimate
presented
at
the
last
session
and
with
the
other
means
of
the
treasury
will
prove
fully
adequate
not
only
to
meet
the
increased
expenditures
resulting
from
the
large
appropriations
made
by
congress
but
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
all
the
public
debt
which
is
at
present
redeemable
it
is
now
estimated
that
the
customs
will
yield
to
the
treasury
during
the
present
year
upward
of
the
public
lands
however
have
proved
less
productive
than
was
anticipated
and
according
to
present
information
will
not
much
exceed
the
expenditures
for
all
objects
other
than
the
public
debt
are
estimated
to
amount
during
the
year
to
about
while
a
still
larger
sum
viz
will
have
been
applied
to
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
public
debt
it
is
expected
however
that
in
consequence
of
the
reduced
rates
of
duty
which
will
take
effect
after
march
d
there
will
be
a
considerable
falling
off
in
the
revenue
from
customs
in
the
year
it
will
never
the
less
be
amply
sufficient
to
provide
for
all
the
wants
of
the
public
service
estimated
even
upon
a
liberal
scale
and
for
the
redemption
and
purchase
of
the
remainder
of
the
public
debt
on
january
st
the
entire
public
debt
of
the
united
states
funded
and
unfunded
will
be
reduced
to
within
a
fraction
of
of
which
are
not
of
right
redeemable
until
january
st
and
not
until
january
d
the
commissioners
of
the
sinking
funds
however
being
invested
with
full
authority
to
purchase
the
debt
at
the
market
price
and
the
means
of
the
treasury
being
ample
it
may
be
hoped
that
the
whole
will
be
extinguished
within
the
year
i
can
not
too
cordially
congratulate
congress
and
my
fellow
citizens
on
the
near
approach
of
that
memorable
and
happy
eventthe
extinction
of
the
public
debt
of
this
great
and
free
nation
faithful
to
the
wise
and
patriotic
policy
marked
out
by
the
legislation
of
the
country
for
this
object
the
present
administration
has
devoted
to
it
all
the
means
which
a
flourishing
commerce
has
supplied
and
a
prudent
economy
preserved
for
the
public
treasury
within
the
four
years
for
which
the
people
have
confided
the
executive
power
to
my
charge
will
have
been
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
that
this
has
been
accomplished
without
stinting
the
expenditures
for
all
other
proper
objects
will
be
seen
by
referring
to
the
liberal
provision
made
during
the
same
period
for
the
support
and
increase
of
our
means
of
maritime
and
military
defense
for
internal
improvements
of
a
national
character
for
the
removal
and
preservation
of
the
indians
and
lastly
for
the
gallant
veterans
of
the
revolution
the
final
removal
of
this
great
burthen
from
our
resources
affords
the
means
of
further
provision
for
all
the
objects
of
general
welfare
and
public
defense
which
the
constitution
authorizes
and
presents
the
occasion
for
such
further
reductions
in
the
revenue
as
may
not
be
required
for
them
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
will
be
seen
that
after
the
present
year
such
a
reduction
may
be
made
to
a
considerable
extent
and
the
subject
is
earnestly
recommended
to
the
consideration
of
congress
in
the
hope
that
the
combined
wisdom
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
will
devise
such
means
of
effecting
that
salutary
object
as
may
remove
those
burthens
which
shall
be
found
to
fall
unequally
upon
any
and
as
may
promote
all
the
great
interests
of
the
community
long
and
patient
reflection
has
strengthened
the
opinions
i
have
heretofore
expressed
to
congress
on
this
subject
and
i
deem
it
my
duty
on
the
present
occasion
again
to
urge
them
upon
the
attention
of
the
legislature
the
soundest
maxims
of
public
policy
and
the
principals
upon
which
our
republican
institutions
are
founded
recommend
a
proper
adaptation
of
the
revenue
to
the
expenditure
and
they
also
require
that
the
expenditure
shall
be
limited
to
what
by
an
economical
administration
shall
be
consistent
with
the
simplicity
of
the
government
and
necessary
to
an
efficient
public
service
in
effecting
this
adjustment
it
is
due
in
justice
to
the
interests
of
the
different
states
and
even
to
the
preservation
of
the
union
itself
that
the
protection
afforded
by
existing
laws
to
any
branches
of
the
national
industry
should
not
exceed
what
may
be
necessary
to
counteract
the
regulations
of
foreign
nations
and
to
secure
a
supply
o
f
those
articles
of
manufacture
essential
to
the
national
independence
and
safety
in
time
of
war
if
upon
investigation
it
shall
be
found
as
it
is
believed
it
will
be
that
the
legislative
protection
granted
to
any
particular
interest
is
greater
than
is
indispensably
requisite
for
these
objects
i
recommend
that
it
be
gradually
diminished
and
that
as
far
as
may
be
consistent
with
these
objects
the
whole
scheme
of
duties
be
reduced
to
the
revenue
standard
as
soon
as
a
just
regard
to
the
faith
of
the
government
and
to
the
preservation
of
the
large
capital
invested
in
establishments
of
domestic
industry
will
permit
that
manufactures
adequate
to
the
supply
of
our
domestic
consumption
would
in
the
abstract
be
beneficial
to
our
country
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
and
to
effect
their
establishment
there
is
perhaps
no
american
citizen
who
would
not
for
a
while
be
willing
to
pay
a
higher
price
for
them
but
for
this
purpose
it
is
presumed
that
a
tariff
of
high
duties
designed
for
perpetual
protection
which
they
maintain
has
the
effect
to
reduce
the
price
by
domestic
competition
below
that
of
the
foreign
article
experience
however
our
best
guide
on
this
as
on
other
subjects
makes
it
doubtful
whether
the
advantages
of
this
system
are
not
counterbalanced
by
many
evils
and
whether
it
does
not
tend
to
beget
in
the
minds
of
a
large
portion
of
our
countrymen
a
spirit
of
discontent
and
jealousy
dangerous
to
the
stability
of
the
union
what
then
shall
be
done
large
interests
have
grown
up
under
the
implied
pledge
of
our
national
legislation
which
it
would
seem
a
violation
of
public
faith
suddenly
to
abandon
nothing
could
justify
it
but
the
public
safety
which
is
the
supreme
law
but
those
who
have
vested
their
capital
in
manufacturing
establishments
can
not
expect
that
the
people
will
continue
permanently
to
pay
high
taxes
for
their
benefit
when
the
money
is
not
required
for
any
legitimate
purpose
in
the
administration
of
the
government
is
it
not
enough
that
the
high
duties
have
been
paid
as
long
as
the
money
arising
from
them
could
be
applied
to
the
common
benefit
in
the
extinguishment
of
the
public
debt
those
who
take
an
enlarged
view
of
the
condition
of
our
country
must
be
satisfied
that
the
policy
of
protection
must
be
ultimately
limited
to
those
articles
of
domestic
manufacture
which
are
indispensable
to
our
safety
in
time
of
war
within
this
scope
on
a
reasonable
scale
it
is
recommended
by
every
consideration
of
patriotism
and
duty
which
will
doubtless
always
secure
to
it
a
liberal
and
efficient
support
but
beyond
this
object
we
have
already
seen
the
operation
of
the
system
productive
of
discontent
in
some
sections
of
the
republic
its
influence
is
deprecated
as
tending
to
concentrate
wealth
into
a
few
hands
and
as
creating
those
germs
of
dependence
and
vice
which
in
other
countries
have
characterized
the
existence
of
monopolies
and
proved
so
destructive
of
liberty
and
the
general
good
a
large
portion
of
the
people
in
one
section
of
the
republic
declares
it
not
only
inexpedient
on
these
grounds
but
as
disturbing
the
equal
relations
of
property
by
legislation
and
therefore
unconstitutional
and
unjust
doubtless
these
effects
are
in
a
great
degree
exaggerated
and
may
be
ascribed
to
a
mistaken
view
of
the
considerations
which
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
tariff
system
but
they
are
never
the
less
important
in
enabling
us
to
review
the
subject
with
a
more
thorough
knowledge
of
all
its
bearings
upon
the
great
interests
of
the
republic
and
with
a
determination
to
dispose
of
it
so
that
none
can
with
justice
complain
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
state
that
in
one
quarter
of
the
united
states
opposition
to
the
revenue
laws
has
arisen
to
a
height
which
threatens
to
thwart
their
execution
if
not
to
endanger
the
integrity
of
the
union
what
ever
obstructions
may
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
the
judicial
authorities
of
the
general
government
it
is
hoped
they
will
be
able
peaceably
to
overcome
them
by
the
prudence
of
their
own
officers
and
the
patriotism
of
the
people
but
should
this
reasonable
reliance
on
the
moderation
and
good
sense
of
all
portions
of
our
fellow
citizens
be
disappointed
it
is
believed
that
the
laws
themselves
are
fully
adequate
to
the
suppression
of
such
attempts
as
may
be
immediately
made
should
the
exigency
arise
rendering
the
execution
of
the
existing
laws
impracticable
from
any
cause
what
ever
prompt
notice
of
it
will
be
given
to
congress
with
a
suggestion
of
such
views
and
measures
as
may
be
deemed
necessary
to
meet
it
in
conformity
with
principles
heretofore
explained
and
with
the
hope
of
reducing
the
general
government
to
that
simple
machine
which
the
constitution
created
and
of
withdrawing
from
the
states
all
other
influence
than
that
of
its
universal
beneficence
in
preserving
peace
affording
an
uniform
currency
maintaining
the
inviolability
of
contracts
diffusing
intelligence
and
discharging
unfelt
its
other
superintending
functions
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
to
dispose
of
all
stocks
now
held
by
it
in
corporations
whether
created
by
the
general
or
state
governments
and
placing
the
proceeds
in
the
treasury
as
a
source
of
profit
these
stocks
are
of
little
or
no
value
as
a
means
of
influence
among
the
states
they
are
adverse
to
the
purity
of
our
institutions
the
whole
principle
on
which
they
are
based
is
deemed
by
many
unconstitutional
and
to
persist
in
the
policy
which
they
indicate
is
considered
wholly
inexpedient
it
is
my
duty
to
acquaint
you
with
an
arrangement
made
by
the
bank
of
the
united
states
with
a
portion
of
the
holders
of
the
stock
by
which
the
government
will
be
deprived
of
the
use
of
the
public
funds
longer
than
was
anticipated
by
this
arrangement
which
will
be
particularly
explained
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
a
surrender
of
the
certificates
of
this
stock
may
be
postponed
until
october
and
thus
may
be
continued
by
the
failure
of
the
bank
to
perform
its
duties
such
measures
as
are
within
the
reach
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
have
been
taken
to
enable
him
to
judge
whether
the
public
deposits
in
that
institution
may
be
regarded
as
entirely
safe
but
as
his
limited
power
may
prove
inadequate
to
this
object
i
recommend
the
subject
to
the
attention
of
congress
under
the
firm
belief
that
it
is
worthy
of
their
serious
investigation
an
inquiry
into
the
transactions
of
the
institution
embracing
the
branches
as
well
as
the
principal
bank
seems
called
for
by
the
credit
which
is
given
throughout
the
country
to
many
serious
charges
impeaching
its
character
and
which
if
true
may
justly
excite
the
apprehension
that
it
is
no
longer
a
safe
depository
of
the
money
of
the
people
among
the
interests
which
merit
the
consideration
of
congress
after
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
one
of
the
most
important
in
my
view
is
that
of
the
public
lands
previous
to
the
formation
of
our
present
constitution
it
was
recommended
by
congress
that
a
portion
of
the
waste
lands
owned
by
the
states
should
be
ceded
to
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
general
harmony
and
as
a
fund
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
war
the
recommendation
was
adopted
and
at
different
periods
of
time
the
states
of
massachusetts
new
york
virginia
north
and
south
carolina
and
georgia
granted
their
vacant
soil
for
the
uses
for
which
they
had
been
asked
as
the
lands
may
now
be
considered
as
relieved
from
this
pledge
it
is
in
the
discretion
of
congress
to
dispose
of
them
in
such
way
as
best
to
conduce
to
the
quiet
harmony
and
general
interest
of
the
american
people
in
examining
this
question
all
local
and
sectional
feelings
should
be
discarded
and
the
whole
united
states
regarded
as
one
people
interested
alike
in
the
prosperity
of
their
common
country
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
speedy
settlement
of
these
lands
constitutes
the
true
interest
of
the
republic
the
wealth
and
strength
of
a
country
are
its
population
and
the
best
part
of
that
population
are
cultivators
of
the
soil
independent
farmers
are
every
where
the
basis
of
society
and
true
friends
of
liberty
in
addition
to
these
considerations
questions
have
already
arisen
and
may
be
expected
hereafter
to
grow
out
of
the
public
lands
which
involve
the
rights
of
the
new
states
and
the
powers
of
the
general
government
and
unless
a
liberal
policy
be
now
adopted
there
is
danger
that
these
questions
may
speedily
assume
an
importance
not
now
generally
anticipated
the
influence
of
a
great
sectional
interest
when
brought
into
full
action
will
be
found
more
dangerous
to
the
harmony
and
union
of
the
states
than
any
other
cause
of
discontent
and
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
and
sound
policy
to
foresee
its
approaches
and
endeavor
if
possible
to
counteract
them
of
the
various
schemes
which
have
been
hitherto
proposed
in
regard
to
the
disposal
of
the
public
lands
none
has
yet
received
the
entire
approbation
of
the
national
legislature
deeply
impressed
with
the
importance
of
a
speedy
and
satisfactory
arrangement
of
the
subject
i
deem
it
my
duty
on
this
occasion
to
urge
it
upon
your
consideration
and
to
the
propositions
which
have
been
heretofore
suggested
by
others
to
contribute
those
reflections
which
have
occurred
to
me
in
the
hope
that
they
may
assist
you
in
your
future
deliberations
it
seems
to
me
to
be
our
policy
that
the
public
lands
shall
cease
as
soon
as
practicable
to
be
a
source
of
revenue
and
that
they
be
sold
to
settlers
in
limited
parcels
at
a
price
barely
sufficient
to
reimburse
to
the
united
states
the
expense
of
the
present
system
and
the
cost
arising
under
our
indian
compacts
the
advantages
of
accurate
surveys
and
undoubted
titles
now
secured
to
purchasers
seem
to
forbid
the
abolition
of
the
present
system
because
none
can
be
substituted
which
will
more
perfectly
accomplish
these
important
ends
it
is
desirable
however
that
in
convenient
time
this
machinery
be
withdrawn
from
the
states
and
that
the
right
of
soil
and
the
future
disposition
of
it
be
surrendered
to
the
states
respectively
in
which
it
lies
the
adventurous
and
hardy
population
of
the
west
besides
contributing
their
equal
share
of
taxation
under
our
impost

system
have
in
the
progress
of
our
government
for
the
lands
they
occupy
paid
into
the
treasury
a
large
proportion
of
and
of
the
revenue
received
therefrom
but
a
small
part
has
been
expended
among
them
when
to
the
disadvantage
of
their
situation
in
this
respect
we
add
the
consideration
that
it
is
their
labor
alone
which
gives
real
value
to
the
lands
and
that
the
proceeds
arising
from
their
sale
are
distributed
chiefly
among
states
which
had
not
originally
any
claim
to
them
and
which
have
enjoyed
the
undivided
emolument
arising
from
the
sale
of
their
own
lands
it
can
not
be
expected
that
the
new
states
will
remain
longer
contented
with
the
present
policy
after
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
to
avert
the
consequences
which
may
be
apprehended
from
this
cause
to
pub
an
end
for
ever
to
all
partial
and
interested
legislation
on
the
subject
and
to
afford
to
every
american
citizen
of
enterprise
the
opportunity
of
securing
an
independent
freehold
it
seems
to
me
therefore
best
to
abandon
the
idea
of
raising
a
future
revenue
out
of
the
public
lands
in
former
messages
i
have
expressed
my
conviction
that
the
constitution
does
not
warrant
the
application
of
the
funds
of
the
general
government
to
objects
of
internal
improvement
which
are
not
national
in
their
character
and
both
as
a
means
of
doing
justice
to
all
interests
and
putting
an
end
to
a
course
of
legislation
calculated
to
destroy
the
purity
of
the
government
have
urged
the
necessity
of
reducing
the
whole
subject
to
some
fixed
and
certain
rule
as
there
never
will
occur
a
period
perhaps
more
propitious
than
the
present
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
i
beg
leave
to
press
the
subject
again
upon
your
attention
without
some
general
and
welldefined
principles
ascertaining
those
objects
of
internal
improvement
to
which
the
means
of
the
nation
may
be
constitutionally
applied
it
is
obvious
that
the
exercise
of
the
power
can
never
be
satisfactory
besides
the
danger
to
which
it
exposes
congress
of
making
hasty
appropriations
to
works
of
the
character
of
which
they
may
be
frequently
ignorant
it
promotes
a
mischievous
and
corrupting
influence
upon
elections
by
holding
out
to
the
people
the
fallacious
hope
that
the
success
of
a
certain
candidate
will
make
navigable
their
neighboring
creek
or
river
bring
commerce
to
their
doors
and
increase
the
value
of
their
property
it
thus
favors
combinations
to
squander
the
treasure
of
the
country
upon
a
multitude
of
local
objects
as
fatal
to
just
legislation
as
to
the
purity
of
public
men
if
a
system
compatible
with
the
constitution
can
not
be
devised
which
is
free
from
such
tendencies
we
should
recollect
that
that
instrument
provides
within
itself
the
mode
of
its
amendment
and
that
there
is
therefore
no
excuse
for
the
assumption
of
doubtful
powers
by
the
general
government
if
those
which
are
clearly
granted
shall
be
found
incompetent
to
the
ends
of
its
creation
it
can
at
any
time
apply
for
their
enlargement
and
there
is
no
probability
that
such
an
application
if
founded
on
the
public
interest
will
ever
be
refused
if
the
propriety
of
the
proposed
grant
be
not
sufficiently
apparent
to
command
the
assent
of
of
the
states
the
best
possible
reason
why
the
power
should
not
be
assumed
on
doubtful
authority
is
afforded
for
if
more
than
one
quarter
of
the
states
are
unwilling
to
make
the
grant
its
exercise
will
be
productive
of
discontents
which
will
far
overbalance
any
advantages
that
could
be
derived
from
it
all
must
admit
that
there
is
nothing
so
worthy
of
the
constant
solicitude
of
this
government
as
the
harmony
and
union
of
the
people
being
solemnly
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
the
extension
of
the
power
to
make
internal
improvements
beyond
the
limit
i
have
suggested
even
if
it
be
deemed
constitutional
is
subversive
of
the
best
interests
of
our
country
i
earnestly
recommend
to
congress
to
refrain
from
its
exercise
in
doubtful
cases
except
in
relation
to
improvements
already
begun
unless
they
shall
first
procure
from
the
states
such
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
as
will
define
its
character
and
prescribe
its
bounds
if
the
states
feel
themselves
competent
to
these
objects
why
should
this
government
wish
to
assume
the
power
if
they
do
not
then
they
will
not
hesitate
to
make
the
grant
both
governments
are
the
governments
of
the
people
improvements
must
be
made
with
the
money
of
the
people
and
if
the
money
can
be
collected
and
applied
by
those
more
simple
and
economical
political
machines
the
state
governments
it
will
unquestionably
be
safer
and
better
for
the
people
than
to
add
to
the
splendor
the
patronage
and
the
power
of
the
general
government
but
if
the
people
of
the
several
states
think
otherwise
they
will
amend
the
constitution
and
in
their
decision
all
ought
cheerfully
to
acquiesce
for
a
detailed
and
highly
satisfactory
view
of
the
operations
of
the
war
department
i
refer
you
to
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
the
hostile
incursions
of
the
sac
and
fox
indians
necessarily
led
to
the
interposition
of
the
government
a
portion
of
the
troops
under
generals
scott
and
atkinson
and
of
the
militia
of
the
state
of
illinois
were
called
into
the
field
after
a
harassing
warfare
prolonged
by
the
nature
of
the
country
and
by
the
difficulty
of
procuring
subsistence
the
indians
were
entirely
defeated
and
the
disaffected
band
dispersed
or
destroyed
the
result
has
been
creditable
to
the
troops
engaged
in
the
service
severe
as
is
the
lesson
to
the
indians
it
was
rendered
necessary
by
their
unprovoked
aggressions
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
its
impression
will
be
permanent
and
salutary
this
campaign
has
evinced
the
efficient
organization
of
the
army
and
its
capacity
for
prompt
and
active
service
its
several
departments
have
performed
their
functions
with
energy
and
dispatch
and
the
general
movement
was
satisfactory
our
fellow
citizens
upon
the
frontiers
were
ready
as
they
always
are
in
the
tender
of
their
services
in
the
hour
of
danger
but
a
more
efficient
organization
of
our
militia
system
is
essential
to
that
security
which
is
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
all
governments
neither
our
situation
nor
our
institutions
require
or
permit
the
maintenance
of
a
large
regular
force
history
offers
too
many
lessons
of
the
fatal
result
of
such
a
measure
not
to
warn
us
against
its
adoption
here
the
expense
which
attends
it
the
obvious
tendency
to
employ
it
because
it
exists
and
thus
to
engage
in
unnecessary
wars
and
its
ultimate
danger
to
public
liberty
will
lead
us
i
trust
to
place
our
principal
dependence
for
protection
upon
the
great
body
of
the
citizens
of
the
republic
if
in
asserting
rights
or
in
repelling
wrongs
war
should
come
upon
us
our
regular
force
should
be
increased
to
an
extent
proportional
to
the
emergency
and
our
present
small
army
is
a
nucleus
around
which
such
force
could
be
formed
and
embodied
but
for
the
purposes
of
defense
under
ordinary
circumstances
we
must
rely
upon
the
electors
of
the
country
those
by
whom
and
for
whom
the
government
was
instituted
and
is
supported
will
constitute
its
protection
in
the
hour
of
danger
as
they
do
its
check
in
the
hour
of
safety
but
it
is
obvious
that
the
militia
system
is
imperfect
much
time
is
lost
much
unnecessary
expense
incurred
and
much
public
property
wasted
under
the
present
arrangement
little
useful
knowledge
is
gained
by
the
musters
and
drills
as
now
established
and
the
whole
subject
evidently
requires
a
thorough
examination
whether
a
plan
of
classification
remedying
these
defects
and
providing
for
a
system
of
instruction
might
not
be
adopted
is
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
constitution
has
vested
in
the
general
government
an
independent
authority
upon
the
subject
of
the
militia
which
renders
its
action
essential
to
the
establishment
or
improvement
of
the
system
and
i
recommend
the
matter
to
your
consideration
in
the
conviction
that
the
state
of
this
important
arm
of
the
public
defense
requires
your
attention
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
the
wise
and
humane
policy
of
transferring
from
the
eastern
to
the
western
side
of
the
mississippi
the
remnants
of
our
aboriginal
tribes
with
their
own
consent
and
upon
just
terms
has
been
steadily
pursued
and
is
approaching
i
trust
its
consummation
by
reference
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
to
the
documents
submitted
with
it
you
will
see
the
progress
which
has
been
made
since
your
last
session
in
the
arrangement
of
the
various
matters
connected
with
our
indian
relations
with
one
exception
every
subject
involving
any
question
of
conflicting
jurisdiction
or
of
peculiar
difficulty
has
been
happily
disposed
of
and
the
conviction
evidently
gains
ground
among
the
indians
that
their
removal
to
the
country
assigned
by
the
united
states
for
their
permanent
residence
furnishes
the
only
hope
of
their
ultimate
prosperity
with
that
portion
of
the
cherokees
however
living
within
the
state
of
georgia
it
has
been
found
impracticable
as
yet
to
make
a
satisfactory
adjustment
such
was
my
anxiety
to
remove
all
the
grounds
of
complaint
and
to
bring
to
a
termination
the
difficulties
in
which
they
are
involved
that
i
directed
the
very
liberal
propositions
to
be
made
to
them
which
accompany
the
documents
herewith
submitted
they
can
not
but
have
seen
in
these
offers
the
evidence
of
the
strongest
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
deal
justly
and
liberally
with
them
an
ample
indemnity
was
offered
for
their
present
possessions
a
liberal
provision
for
their
future
support
and
improvement
and
full
security
for
their
private
and
political
rights
what
ever
difference
of
opinion
may
have
prevailed
respecting
the
just
claims
of
these
people
there
will
probably
be
none
respecting
the
liberality
of
the
propositions
and
very
little
respecting
the
expediency
of
their
immediate
acceptance
they
were
however
rejected
and
thus
the
position
of
these
indians
remains
unchanged
as
do
the
views
communicated
in
my
message
to
the
senate
of
february
d
i
refer
you
to
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
which
accompanies
this
message
for
a
de
tail
of
the
operations
of
that
branch
of
the
service
during
the
present
year
besides
the
general
remarks
on
some
of
the
transactions
of
our
navy
presented
in
the
view
which
has
been
taken
of
our
foreign
relations
i
seize
this
occasion
to
invite
to
your
notice
the
increased
protection
which
it
has
afforded
to
our
commerce
and
citizens
on
distant
seas
without
any
augmentation
of
the
force
in
commission
in
the
gradual
improvement
of
its
pecuniary
concerns
in
the
constant
progress
in
the
collection
of
materials
suitable
for
use
during
future
emergencies
and
in
the
construction
of
vessels
and
the
buildings
necessary
to
their
preservation
and
repair
the
present
state
of
this
branch
of
the
service
exhibits
the
fruits
of
that
vigilance
and
care
which
are
so
indispensable
to
its
efficiency
various
new
suggestions
contained
in
the
annexed
report
as
well
as
others
heretofore
to
congress
are
worthy
of
your
attention
but
none
more
so
than
that
urging
the
renewal
for
another
term
of
six
years
of
the
general
appropriation
for
the
gradual
improvement
of
the
navy
from
the
accompanying
report
of
the
post
master
general
you
will
also
perceive
that
that
department
continues
to
extend
its
usefulness
without
impairing
its
resources
or
lessening
the
accommodations
which
it
affords
in
the
secure
and
rapid
transportation
of
the
mail
i
beg
leave
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
views
heretofore
expressed
in
relation
to
the
mode
of
choosing
the
president
and
vice
president
of
the
united
states
and
to
those
respecting
the
tenure
of
office
generally
still
impressed
with
the
justness
of
those
views
and
with
the
belief
that
the
modifications
suggested
on
those
subjects
if
adopted
will
contribute
to
the
prosperity
and
harmony
of
the
country
i
earnestly
recommend
them
to
your
consideration
at
this
time
i
have
heretofore
pointed
out
defects
in
the
law
for
punishing
official
frauds
especially
within
the
district
of
columbia
it
has
been
found
almost
impossible
to
bring
notorious
culprits
to
punishment
and
according
to
a
decision
of
the
court
for
this
district
a
prosecution
is
barred
by
a
lapse
of
two
years
after
the
fraud
has
been
committed
it
may
happen
again
as
it
has
already
happened
that
during
the
whole
two
years
all
the
evidences
of
the
fraud
may
be
in
the
possession
of
the
culprit
himself
however
proper
the
limitation
may
be
in
relation
to
private
citizens
it
would
seem
that
it
ought
not
to
commence
running
in
favor
of
public
officers
until
they
go
out
of
office
the
judiciary
system
of
the
united
states
remains
imperfect
of
the
western
and
south
western
states
three
only
enjoy
the
benefits
of
a
circuit
court
ohio
kentucky
and
tennessee
are
embraced
in
the
general
system
but
indiana
illinois
missouri
alabama
mississippi
and
louisiana
have
only
district
courts
if
the
existing
system
be
a
good
one
why
should
it
not
be
extended
if
it
be
a
bad
one
why
is
it
suffered
to
exist
the
new
states
were
promised
equal
rights
and
privileges
when
they
came
into
the
union
and
such
are
the
guaranties
of
the
constitution
nothing
can
be
more
obvious
than
the
obligation
of
the
general
government
to
place
all
the
states
on
the
same
footing
in
relation
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
i
trust
this
duty
will
be
neglected
no
longer
on
many
of
the
subjects
to
which
your
attention
is
invited
in
this
communication
it
is
a
source
of
gratification
to
reflect
that
the
steps
to
be
now
adopted
are
uninfluenced
by
the
embarrassments
entailed
upon
the
country
by
the
wars
through
which
it
has
passed
in
regard
to
most
of
our
great
interests
we
may
consider
ourselves
as
just
starting
in
our
career
and
after
a
salutary
experience
about
to
fix
upon
a
permanent
basis
the
policy
best
calculated
to
promote
the
happiness
of
the
people
and
facilitate
their
progress
toward
the
most
complete
enjoyment
of
civil
liberty
on
an
occasion
so
interesting
and
important
in
our
history
and
of
such
anxious
concern
to
the
friends
of
freedom
throughout
the
world
it
is
our
imperious
duty
to
lay
aside
all
selfish
and
local
considerations
and
be
guided
by
a
lofty
spirit
of
devotion
to
the
great
principles
on
which
our
institutions
are
founded
that
this
government
may
be
so
administered
as
to
preserve
its
efficiency
in
promoting
and
securing
these
general
objects
should
be
the
only
aim
of
our
ambition
and
we
can
not
therefore
too
carefully
examine
its
structure
in
order
that
we
may
not
mistake
its
powers
or
assume
those
which
the
people
have
reserved
to
themselves
or
have
preferred
to
assign
to
other
agents
we
should
bear
constantly
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
considerations
which
induced
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
withhold
from
the
general
government
the
power
to
regulate
the
great
mass
of
the
business
and
concerns
of
the
people
have
been
fully
justified
by
experience
and
that
it
can
not
now
be
doubted
that
the
genius
of
all
our
institutions
prescribes
simplicity
and
economy
as
the
characteristics
of
the
reform
which
is
yet
to
be
effected
in
the
present
and
future
execution
of
the
functions
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
constitution
limited
to
a
general
superintending
power
to
maintain
peace
at
home
and
abroad
and
to
prescribe
laws
on
a
few
subjects
of
general
interest
not
calculated
to
restrict
human
liberty
but
to
enforce
human
rights
this
government
will
find
its
strength
and
its
glory
in
the
faithful
discharge
of
these
plain
and
simple
duties
relieved
by
its
protecting
shield
from
the
fear
of
war
and
the
apprehension
of
oppression
the
free
enterprise
of
our
citizens
aided
by
the
state
sovereignties
will
work
out
improvements
and
ameliorations
which
can
not
fail
to
demonstrate
that
the
great
truth
that
the
people
can
govern
themselves
is
not
only
realized
in
our
example
but
that
it
is
done
by
a
machinery
in
government
so
simple
and
economical
as
scarcely
to
be
felt
that
the
almighty
ruler
of
the
universe
may
so
direct
our
deliberations
and
overrule
our
acts
as
to
make
us
instrumental
in
securing
a
result
so
dear
to
mankind
is
my
most
earnest
and
sincere
prayer

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
representation
of
the
people
has
been
renewed
for
the
nd
time
since
the
constitution
they
formed
has
been
in
force
for
near
half
a
century
the
chief
magistrates
who
have
been
successively
chosen
have
made
their
annual
communications
of
the
state
of
the
nation
to
its
representatives
generally
these
communications
have
been
of
the
most
gratifying
nature
testifying
an
advance
in
all
the
improvements
of
social
and
all
the
securities
of
political
life
but
frequently
and
justly
as
you
have
been
called
on
to
be
grateful
for
the
bounties
of
providence
at
few
periods
have
they
been
more
abundantly
or
extensively
bestowed
than
at
the
present
rarely
if
ever
have
we
had
greater
reason
to
congratulate
each
other
on
the
continued
and
increasing
prosperity
of
our
beloved
country
agriculture
the
first
and
most
important
occupation
of
man
has
compensated
the
labors
of
the
husbandman
with
plentiful
crops
of
all
the
varied
products
of
our
extensive
country
manufactures
have
been
established
in
which
the
funds
of
the
capitalist
find
a
profitable
investment
and
which
give
employment
and
subsistence
to
a
numerous
and
increasing
body
of
industrious
and
dexterous
mechanics
the
laborer
is
rewarded
by
high
wages
in
the
construction
of
works
of
internal
improvement
which
are
extending
with
unprecedented
rapidity
science
is
steadily
penetrating
the
recesses
of
nature
and
disclosing
her
secrets
while
the
ingenuity
of
free
minds
is
subjecting
the
elements
to
the
power
of
man
and
making
each
new
conquest
auxiliary
to
his
comfort
by
our
mails
whose
speed
is
regularly
increased
and
whose
routes
are
every
year
extended
the
communication
of
public
intelligence
and
private
business
is
rendered
frequent
and
safe
the
intercourse
between
distant
cities
which
it
formerly
required
weeks
to
accomplish
is
now
effected
in
a
few
days
and
in
the
construction
of
rail
roads
and
the
application
of
steam
power
we
have
a
reasonable
prospect
that
the
extreme
parts
of
our
country
will
be
so
much
approximated
and
those
most
isolated
by
the
obstacles
of
nature
rendered
so
accessible
as
to
remove
an
apprehension
some
times
entertained
that
the
great
extent
of
the
union
would
endanger
its
permanent
existence
if
from
the
satisfactory
view
of
our
agriculture
manufactures
and
internal
improvements
we
turn
to
the
state
of
our
navigation
and
trade
with
foreign
nations
and
between
the
states
we
shall
scarcely
find
less
cause
for
gratulation
a
beneficent
providence
has
provided
for
their
exercise
and
encouragement
an
extensive
coast
indented
by
capacious
bays
noble
rivers
inland
seas
with
a
country
productive
of
every
material
for
ship
building
and
every
commodity
for
gainful
commerce
and
filled
with
a
population
active
intelligent
wellinformed
and
fearless
of
danger
these
advantages
are
not
neglected
and
an
impulse
has
lately
been
given
to
commercial
enterprise
which
fills
our
ship
yards
with
new
constructions
encourages
all
the
arts
and
branches
of
industry
connected
with
them
crowds
the
wharves
of
our
cities
with
vessels
and
covers
the
most
distant
seas
with
our
canvas
let
us
be
grateful
for
these
blessings
to
the
beneficent
being
who
has
conferred
them
and
who
suffers
us
to
indulge
a
reasonable
hope
of
their
continuance
and
extension
while
we
neglect
not
the
means
by
which
they
may
be
preserved
if
we
may
dare
to
judge
of
his
future
designs
by
the
manner
in
which
his
past
favors
have
been
bestowed
he
has
made
our
national
prosperity
to
depend
on
the
preservation
of
our
liberties
our
national
force
on
our
federal
union
and
our
individual
happiness
on
the
maintenance
of
our
state
rights
and
wise
institutions
if
we
are
prosperous
at
home
and
respected
abroad
it
is
because
we
are
free
united
industrious
and
obedient
to
the
laws
while
we
continue
so
we
shall
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
go
on
in
the
happy
career
we
have
begun
and
which
has
brought
us
in
the
short
period
of
our
political
existence
from
a
population
of
to
from
separate
colonies
to
united
states
from
weakness
to
strength
from
a
rank
scarcely
marked
in
the
scale
of
nations
to
a
high
place
in
their
respect
this
last
advantage
is
one
that
has
resulted
in
a
great
degree
from
the
principles
which
have
guided
our
intercourse
with
foreign
powers
since
we
have
assumed
an
equal
station
among
them
and
hence
the
annual
account
which
the
executive
renders
to
the
country
of
the
manner
in
which
that
branch
of
his
duties
has
been
fulfilled
proves
instructive
and
salutary
the
pacific
and
wise
policy
of
our
government
kept
us
in
a
state
of
neutrality
during
the
wars
that
have
at
different
periods
since
our
political
existence
been
carried
on
by
other
powers
but
this
policy
while
it
gave
activity
and
extent
to
our
commerce
exposed
it
in
the
same
proportion
to
injuries
from
the
belligerent
nations
hence
have
arisen
claims
of
indemnity
for
those
injuries
england
france
spain
holland
sweden
denmark
naples
and
lately
portugal
had
all
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
infringed
our
neutral
rights
demands
for
reparation
were
made
upon
all
they
have
had
in
all
and
continue
to
have
in
some
cases
a
leading
influence
on
the
nature
of
our
relations
with
the
powers
on
whom
they
were
made
of
the
claims
upon
england
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
further
than
to
say
that
the
state
of
things
to
which
their
prosecution
and
denial
gave
rise
has
been
succeeded
by
arrangements
productive
of
mutual
good
feeling
and
amicable
relations
between
the
two
countries
which
it
is
hoped
will
not
be
interrupted
one
of
these
arrangements
is
that
relating
to
the
colonial
trade
which
was
communicated
to
congress
at
the
last
session
and
although
the
short
period
during
which
it
has
been
in
force
will
not
enable
me
to
form
an
accurate
judgment
of
its
operation
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
prove
highly
beneficial
the
trade
thereby
authorized
has
employed
to
september
th
upward
of
thousand
tons
of
american
and
thousand
tons
of
foreign
shipping
in
the
outward
voyages
and
in
the
inward
nearly
an
equal
amount
of
american
and
thousand
only
of
foreign
tonnage
advantages
too
have
resulted
to
our
agricultural
interests
from
the
state
of
the
trade
between
canada
and
our
territories
and
states
bordering
or
the
st
lawrence
and
the
lakes
which
may
prove
more
than
equivalent
to
the
loss
sustained
by
the
discrimination
made
to
favor
the
trade
of
the
northern
colonies
with
the
west
indies
after
our
transition
from
the
state
of
colonies
to
that
of
an
independent
nation
many
points
were
found
necessary
to
be
settled
between
us
and
great
britain
among
them
was
the
demarcation
of
boundaries
not
described
with
sufficient
precision
in
the
treaty
of
peace
some
of
the
lines
that
divide
the
states
and
territories
of
the
united
states
from
the
british
provinces
have
been
definitively
fixed
that
however
which
separates
us
from
the
provinces
of
canada
and
new
brunswick
to
the
north
and
the
east
was
still
in
dispute
when
i
came
into
office
but
i
found
arrangements
made
for
its
settlement
over
which
i
had
no
control
the
commissioners
who
had
been
appointed
under
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
ghent
having
been
unable
to
agree
a
convention
was
made
with
great
britain
by
my
immediate
predecessor
in
office
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
the
points
of
difference
which
have
arisen
in
the
settlement
of
the
boundary
line
between
the
american
and
british
dominions
as
described
in
the
th
article
of
the
treaty
of
ghent
shall
be
referred
as
therein
provided
to
some
friendly
sovereign
or
state
who
shall
be
invited
to
investigate
and
make
a
decision
upon
such
points
of
difference
and
the
king
of
the
netherlands
having
by
the
late
president
and
his
britannic
majesty
been
designated
as
such
friendly
sovereign
it
became
my
duty
to
carry
with
good
faith
the
agreement
so
made
into
full
effect
to
this
end
i
caused
all
the
measures
to
be
taken
which
were
necessary
to
a
full
exposition
of
our
case
to
the
sovereign
arbiter
and
nominated
as
minister
plenipotentiary
to
his
court
a
distinguished
citizen
of
the
state
most
interested
in
the
question
and
who
had
been
one
of
the
agents
previously
employed
for
settling
the
controversy
on
january
th
his
majesty
the
king
of
the
netherlands
delivered
to
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
united
states
and
of
great
britain
his
written
opinion
on
the
case
referred
to
him
the
papers
in
relation
to
the
subject
will
be
communicated
by
a
special
message
to
the
proper
branch
of
the
government
with
the
perfect
confidence
that
its
wisdom
will
adopt
such
measures
as
will
secure
an
amicable
settlement
of
the
controversy
without
infringing
any
constitutional
right
of
the
states
immediately
interested
it
affords
me
satisfaction
to
inform
you
that
suggestions
made
by
my
direction
to
the
charge
daffaires
of
his
britannic
majesty
to
this
government
have
had
their
desired
effect
in
producing
the
release
of
certain
american
citizens
who
were
imprisoned
for
setting
up
the
authority
of
the
state
of
maine
at
a
place
in
the
disputed
territory
under
the
actual
jurisdiction
of
his
britannic
majesty
from
this
and
the
assurances
i
have
received
of
the
desire
of
the
local
authorities
to
avoid
any
cause
of
collision
i
have
the
best
hopes
that
a
good
understanding
will
be
kept
up
until
it
is
confirmed
by
the
final
disposition
of
the
subject
the
amicable
relations
which
now
subsist
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
the
increasing
intercourse
between
their
citizens
and
the
rapid
obliteration
of
unfriendly
prejudices
to
which
former
events
naturally
gave
rise
concurred
to
present
this
as
a
fit
period
for
renewing
our
endeavors
to
provide
against
the
recurrence
of
causes
of
irritation
which
in
the
event
of
war
between
great
britain
and
any
other
power
would
inevitably
endanger
our
peace
animated
by
the
sincerest
desire
to
avoid
such
a
state
of
things
and
peacefully
to
secure
under
all
possible
circumstances
the
rights
and
honor
of
the
country
i
have
given
such
instructions
to
the
minister
l
ately
sent
to
the
court
of
london
as
will
evince
that
desire
and
if
met
by
a
correspondent
disposition
which
we
can
not
doubt
will
put
an
end
to
causes
of
collision
which
without
advantage
to
either
tend
to
estrange
from
each
other
two
nations
who
have
every
motive
to
preserve
not
only
peace
but
an
intercourse
of
the
most
amicable
nature
in
my
message
at
the
opening
of
the
last
session
of
congress
i
expressed
a
confident
hope
that
the
justice
of
our
claims
upon
france
urged
as
they
were
with
perseverance
and
signal
ability
by
our
minister
there
would
finally
be
acknowledged
this
hope
has
been
realized
a
treaty
has
been
signed
which
will
immediately
be
laid
before
the
senate
for
its
approbation
and
which
containing
stipulations
that
require
legislative
acts
must
have
the
concurrence
of
both
houses
before
it
can
be
carried
into
effect
by
it
the
french
government
engage
to
pay
a
sum
which
if
not
quite
equal
to
that
which
may
be
found
due
to
our
citizens
will
yet
it
is
believed
under
all
circumstances
be
deemed
satisfactory
by
those
interested
the
offer
of
a
gross
sum
instead
of
the
satisfaction
of
each
individual
claim
was
accepted
because
the
only
alternatives
were
a
rigorous
exaction
of
the
whole
amount
stated
to
be
due
on
each
claim
which
might
in
some
instances
be
exaggerated
by
design
in
other
overrated
through
error
and
which
therefore
it
would
have
been
both
ungracious
and
unjust
to
have
insisted
on
or
a
settlement
by
a
mixed
commission
to
which
the
french
negotiators
were
very
averse
and
which
experience
in
other
cases
had
shewn
to
be
dilatory
and
often
wholly
inadequate
to
the
end
a
comparatively
small
sum
is
stipulated
on
our
part
to
go
to
the
extinction
of
all
claims
by
french
citizens
on
our
government
and
a
reduction
of
duties
on
our
cotton
and
their
wines
has
been
agreed
on
as
a
consideration
for
the
renunciation
of
an
important
claim
for
commercial
privileges
under
the
construction
they
gave
to
the
treaty
for
the
cession
of
louisiana
should
this
treaty
receive
the
proper
sanction
a
source
of
irritation
will
be
stopped
that
has
for
so
many
years
in
some
degree
alienated
from
each
other
two
nations
who
from
interest
as
well
as
the
remembrance
of
early
associations
ought
to
cherish
the
most
friendly
relations
an
encouragement
will
be
given
for
perseverance
in
the
demands
of
justice
by
this
new
proof
that
if
steadily
pursued
they
will
be
listened
to
and
admonition
will
be
offered
to
those
powers
if
any
which
may
be
inclined
to
evade
them
that
they
will
never
be
abandoned
above
all
a
just
confidence
will
be
inspired
in
our
fellow
citizens
that
their
government
will
exert
all
the
powers
with
which
they
have
invested
it
in
support
of
their
just
claims
upon
foreign
nations
at
the
same
time
that
the
frank
acknowledgment
and
provision
for
the
payment
of
those
which
were
addressed
to
our
equity
although
unsupported
by
legal
proof
affords
a
practical
illustration
of
our
submission
to
the
divine
rule
of
doing
to
others
what
we
desire
they
should
do
unto
us
sweden
and
denmark
having
made
compensation
for
the
irregularities
committed
by
their
vessels
or
in
their
ports
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
the
parties
concerned
and
having
renewed
the
treaties
of
commerce
entered
into
with
them
our
political
and
commercial
relations
with
those
powers
continue
to
be
on
the
most
friendly
footing
with
spain
our
differences
up
to
february
d
were
settled
by
the
treaty
of
washington
of
that
date
but
at
a
subsequent
period
our
commerce
with
the
states
formerly
colonies
of
spain
on
the
continent
of
america
was
annoyed
and
frequently
interrupted
by
her
public
and
private
armed
ships
they
captured
many
of
our
vessels
prosecuting
a
lawful
commerce
and
sold
them
and
their
cargoes
and
at
one
time
to
our
demands
for
restoration
and
indemnity
opposed
the
allegation
that
they
were
taken
in
the
violation
of
a
blockade
of
all
the
ports
of
those
states
this
blockade
was
declaratory
only
and
the
inadequacy
of
the
force
to
maintain
it
was
so
manifest
that
this
allegation
was
varied
to
a
charge
of
trade
in
contraband
of
war
this
in
its
turn
was
also
found
untenable
and
the
minister
whom
i
sent
with
instructions
to
press
for
the
reparation
that
was
due
to
our
injured
fellow
citizens
has
transmitted
an
answer
to
his
demand
by
which
the
captures
are
declared
to
have
been
legal
and
are
justified
because
the
independence
of
the
states
of
america
never
having
been
acknowledged
by
spain
she
had
a
right
to
prohibit
trade
with
them
under
her
old
colonial
laws
this
ground
of
defense
was
contradictory
not
only
to
those
which
had
been
formerly
alleged
but
to
the
uniform
practice
and
established
laws
of
nations
and
had
been
abandoned
by
spain
herself
in
the
convention
which
granted
indemnity
to
british
subjects
for
captures
made
at
the
same
time
under
the
same
circumstances
and
for
the
same
allegations
with
those
of
which
we
complain
i
however
indulge
the
hope
that
further
reflection
will
lead
to
other
views
and
feel
confident
that
when
his
catholic
majesty
shall
be
convinced
of
the
justice
of
the
claims
his
desire
to
preserve
friendly
relations
between
the
two
countries
which
it
is
my
earnest
endeavor
to
maintain
will
induce
him
to
accede
to
our
demand
i
have
therefore
dispatched
a
special
messenger
with
instructions
to
our
minister
to
bring
the
case
once
more
to
his
consideration
to
the
end
that
if
which
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
the
same
decision
that
can
not
but
be
deemed
an
unfriendly
denial
of
justice
should
be
persisted
in
the
matter
may
before
your
adjournment
be
laid
before
you
the
constitutional
judges
of
what
is
proper
to
be
done
when
negotiation
for
redress
of
injury
fails
the
conclusion
of
a
treaty
for
indemnity
with
france
seemed
to
present
a
favorable
opportunity
to
renew
our
claims
of
a
similar
nature
on
other
powers
and
particularly
in
the
case
of
those
upon
naples
more
especially
as
in
the
course
of
former
negotiations
with
that
power
our
failure
to
induce
france
to
render
us
justice
was
used
as
an
argument
against
us
the
desires
of
the
merchants
who
were
the
principal
sufferers
have
therefore
been
acceded
to
and
a
mission
has
been
instituted
for
the
special
purpose
of
obtaining
for
them
a
reparation
already
too
long
delayed
this
measure
having
been
resolved
on
it
was
put
in
execution
without
waiting
for
the
meeting
of
congress
because
the
state
of
europe
created
an
apprehension
of
events
that
might
have
rendered
our
application
ineffectual
our
demands
upon
the
government
of
the
two
sicilies
are
of
a
peculiar
nature
the
injuries
on
which
they
are
founded
are
not
denied
nor
are
the
atrocity
and
perfidy
under
which
those
injuries
were
perpetrated
attempted
to
be
extenuated
the
sole
ground
on
which
indemnity
has
been
refused
is
the
alleged
illegality
of
the
tenure
by
which
the
monarch
who
made
the
seizures
held
his
crown
this
defense
always
unfounded
in
any
principle
of
the
law
of
nations
now
universally
abandoned
even
by
those
powers
upon
whom
the
responsibility
for
the
acts
of
past
rulers
bore
the
most
heavily
will
unquestionably
be
given
up
by
his
sicilian
majesty
whose
counsels
will
receive
an
impulse
from
that
high
sense
of
honor
and
regard
to
justice
which
are
said
to
characterize
him
and
i
feel
the
fullest
confidence
that
the
talents
of
the
citizen
commissioned
for
that
purpose
will
place
before
him
the
just
claims
of
our
injured
citizens
in
such
as
light
as
will
enable
me
before
your
adjournment
to
announce
that
they
have
been
adjusted
and
secured
precise
instructions
to
the
effect
of
bringing
the
negotiation
to
a
speedy
issue
have
been
given
and
will
be
obeyed
in
the
late
blockade
of
terceira
some
of
the
portuguese
fleet
captured
several
of
our
vessels
and
committed
other
excesses
for
which
reparation
was
demanded
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
dispatching
an
armed
force
to
prevent
any
recurrence
of
a
similar
violence
and
protect
our
citizens
in
the
prosecution
of
their
lawful
commerce
when
official
assurances
on
which
i
relied
made
the
sailing
of
the
ships
unnecessary
since
that
period
frequent
promises
have
been
made
that
full
indemnity
shall
be
given
for
the
injuries
inflicted
and
the
losses
sustained
in
the
performance
there
has
been
some
perhaps
unavoidable
delay
but
i
have
the
fullest
confidence
that
my
earnest
desire
that
this
business
may
at
once
be
closed
which
our
minister
has
been
instructed
strongly
to
express
will
very
soon
be
gratified
i
have
the
better
ground
for
this
hope
from
the
evidence
of
a
friendly
disposition
which
that
government
has
shown
an
actual
reduction
in
the
duty
on
rice
the
produce
of
our
southern
states
authorizing
the
anticipation
that
this
important
article
of
our
export
will
soon
be
admitted
on
the
same
footing
with
that
produced
by
the
most
favored
nation
with
the
other
powers
of
europe
we
have
fortunately
had
no
cause
of
discussions
for
the
redress
of
injuries
with
the
empire
of
the
russias
our
political
connection
is
of
the
most
friendly
and
our
commercial
of
the
most
liberal
kind
we
enjoy
the
advantages
of
navigation
and
trade
given
to
the
most
favored
nation
but
it
has
not
yet
suited
their
policy
or
perhaps
has
not
been
found
convenient
from
other
considerations
to
give
stability
and
reciprocity
to
those
privileges
by
a
commercial
treaty
the
ill
health
of
the
minister
last
year
charged
with
making
a
proposition
for
that
arrangement
did
not
permit
him
to
remain
at
st
petersburg
and
the
attention
of
that
government
during
the
whole
of
the
period
since
his
departure
having
been
occupied
by
the
war
in
which
it
was
engaged
we
have
been
assured
that
nothing
could
have
been
effected
by
his
presence
a
minister
will
soon
be
nominated
as
well
to
effect
this
important
object
as
to
keep
up
the
relations
of
amity
and
good
understanding
of
which
we
have
received
so
many
assurances
and
proofs
from
his
imperial
majesty
and
the
emperor
his
predecessor
the
treaty
with
austria
is
opening
to
us
an
important
trade
with
the
hereditary
dominions
of
the
emperor
the
value
of
which
has
been
hitherto
little
known

and
of
course
not
sufficiently
appreciated
while
our
commerce
finds
an
entrance
into
the
south
of
germany
by
means
of
this
treaty
those
we
have
formed
with
the
hanseatic
towns
and
prussia
and
others
now
in
negotiation
will
open
that
vast
country
to
the
enterprising
spirit
of
our
merchants
on
the
northa
country
abounding
in
all
the
materials
for
a
mutually
beneficial
commerce
filled
with
enlightened
and
industrious
inhabitants
holding
an
important
place
in
the
politics
of
europe
and
to
which
we
owe
so
many
valuable
citizens
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
with
the
porte
was
sent
to
be
exchanged
by
the
gentleman
appointed
our
charge
daffaires
to
that
court
some
difficulties
occurred
on
his
arrival
but
at
the
date
of
his
last
official
dispatch
he
supposed
they
had
been
obviated
and
that
there
was
every
prospect
of
the
exchange
being
speedily
effected
this
finishes
the
connected
view
i
have
thought
it
proper
to
give
of
our
political
and
commercial
relations
in
europe
every
effort
in
my
power
will
be
continued
to
strengthen
and
extend
them
by
treaties
founded
on
principles
of
the
most
perfect
reciprocity
of
interest
neither
asking
nor
conceding
any
exclusive
advantage
but
liberating
as
far
as
it
lies
in
my
power
the
activity
and
industry
of
our
fellow
citizens
from
the
shackles
which
foreign
restrictions
may
impose
to
china
and
the
east
indies
our
commerce
continues
in
its
usual
extent
and
with
increased
facilities
which
the
credit
and
capital
of
our
merchants
afford
by
substituting
bills
for
payments
in
specie
a
daring
outrage
having
been
committed
in
those
seas
by
the
plunder
of
one
of
our
merchantmen
engaged
in
the
pepper
trade
at
a
port
in
sumatra
and
the
piratical
perpetrators
belonging
to
tribes
in
such
a
state
of
society
that
the
usual
course
of
proceedings
between
civilized
nations
could
not
be
pursued
i
forthwith
dispatched
a
frigate
with
orders
to
require
immediate
satisfaction
for
the
injury
and
indemnity
to
the
sufferers
few
changes
have
taken
place
in
our
connections
with
the
independent
states
of
america
since
my
last
communication
to
congress
the
ratification
of
a
commercial
treaty
with
the
united
republics
of
mexico
has
been
for
some
time
under
deliberation
in
their
congress
but
was
still
undecided
at
the
date
of
our
last
dispatches
the
unhappy
civil
commotions
that
have
prevailed
there
were
undoubtedly
the
cause
of
the
delay
but
as
the
government
is
now
said
to
be
tranquillized
we
may
hope
soon
to
receive
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
and
an
arrangement
for
the
demarcation
of
the
boundaries
between
us
in
the
mean
time
an
important
trade
has
been
opened
with
mutual
benefit
from
st
louis
in
the
state
of
missouri
by
caravans
to
the
interior
provinces
of
mexico
this
commerce
is
protected
in
its
progress
through
the
indian
countries
by
the
troops
of
the
united
states
which
have
been
permitted
to
escort
the
caravans
beyond
our
boundaries
to
the
settled
part
of
the
mexican
territory
from
central
america
i
have
received
assurances
of
the
most
friendly
kind
and
a
gratifying
application
for
our
good
offices
to
remove
a
supposed
indisposition
toward
that
government
in
a
neighboring
state
this
application
was
immediately
and
successfully
complied
with
they
gave
us
also
the
pleasing
intelligence
that
differences
which
had
prevailed
in
their
internal
affairs
had
been
peaceably
adjusted
our
treaty
with
this
republic
continues
to
be
faithfully
observed
and
promises
a
great
and
beneficial
commerce
between
the
two
countriesa
commerce
of
the
greatest
importance
if
the
magnificent
project
of
a
ship
canal
through
the
dominions
of
that
state
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
ocean
now
in
serious
contemplation
shall
be
executed
i
have
great
satisfaction
in
communicating
the
success
which
has
attended
the
exertions
of
our
minister
in
colombia
to
procure
a
very
considerable
reduction
in
the
duties
on
our
flour
in
that
republic
indemnity
also
has
been
stipulated
for
injuries
received
by
our
merchants
from
illegal
seizures
and
renewed
assurances
are
given
that
the
treaty
between
the
two
countries
shall
be
faithfully
observed
chili
and
peru
seem
to
be
still
threatened
with
civil
commotions
and
until
they
shall
be
settled
disorders
may
naturally
be
apprehended
requiring
the
constant
presence
of
a
naval
force
in
the
pacific
ocean
to
protect
our
fisheries
and
guard
our
commerce
the
disturbances
that
took
place
in
the
empire
of
brazil
previously
to
and
immediately
consequent
upon
the
abdication
of
the
late
emperor
necessarily
suspended
any
effectual
application
for
the
redress
of
some
past
injuries
suffered
by
our
citizens
from
that
government
while
they
have
been
the
cause
of
others
in
which
all
foreigners
seem
to
have
participated
instructions
have
been
given
to
our
minister
there
to
press
for
indemnity
due
for
losses
occasioned
by
these
irregularities
and
to
take
care
of
our
fellow
citizens
shall
enjoy
all
the
privileges
stipulated
in
their
favor
by
the
treaty
lately
made
between
the
two
powers
all
which
the
good
intelligence
that
prevails
between
our
minister
at
rio
janeiro
and
the
regency
gives
us
the
best
reason
to
expect
i
should
have
placed
buenos
ayres
in
the
list
of
south
american
powers
in
respect
to
which
nothing
of
importance
affecting
us
was
to
be
communicated
but
for
occurrences
which
have
lately
taken
place
at
the
falkland
islands
in
which
the
name
of
that
republic
has
been
used
to
cover
with
a
show
of
authority
acts
injurious
to
our
commerce
and
to
the
property
and
liberty
of
our
fellow
citizens
in
the
course
of
the
present
year
one
of
our
vessels
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
which
we
have
always
enjoyed
without
molestation
has
been
captured
by
a
band
acting
as
they
pretend
under
the
authority
of
the
government
of
buenos
ayres
i
have
therefore
given
orders
for
the
dispatch
of
an
armed
vessel
to
join
our
squadron
in
those
seas
and
aid
in
affording
all
lawful
protection
to
our
trade
which
shall
be
necessary
and
shall
without
delay
send
a
minister
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
and
also
of
the
claim
if
any
that
is
set
up
by
that
government
to
those
islands
in
the
mean
time
i
submit
the
case
to
the
consideration
of
congress
to
the
end
that
they
may
clothe
the
executive
with
such
authority
and
means
as
they
may
deem
necessary
for
providing
a
force
adequate
to
the
complete
protection
of
our
fellow
citizens
fishing
and
trading
in
those
seas
this
rapid
sketch
of
our
foreign
relations
it
is
hoped
fellow
citizens
may
be
of
some
use
in
so
much
of
your
legislation
as
may
bear
on
that
important
subject
while
it
affords
to
the
country
at
large
a
source
of
high
gratification
in
the
contemplation
of
our
political
and
commercial
connection
with
the
rest
of
the
world
at
peace
with
all
having
subjects
of
future
difference
with
few
and
those
susceptible
of
easy
adjustment
extending
our
commerce
gradually
on
all
sides
and
on
none
by
any
but
the
most
liberal
and
mutually
beneficial
means
we
may
by
the
blessing
of
providence
hope
for
all
that
national
prosperity
which
can
be
derived
from
an
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
guided
by
those
eternal
principles
of
justice
and
reciprocal
good
will
which
are
binding
as
well
upon
states
as
the
individuals
of
whom
they
are
composed
i
have
great
satisfaction
in
making
this
statement
of
our
affairs
because
the
course
of
our
national
policy
enables
me
to
do
it
without
any
indiscreet
exposure
of
what
in
other
governments
is
usually
concealed
from
the
people
having
none
but
a
straightforward
open
course
to
pursue
guided
by
a
single
principle
that
will
bear
the
strongest
light
we
have
happily
no
political
combinations
to
form
no
alliances
to
entangle
us
no
complicated
interests
to
consult
and
in
subjecting
all
we
have
done
to
the
consideration
of
our
citizens
and
to
the
inspection
of
the
world
we
give
no
advantage
to
other
nations
and
lay
ourselves
open
to
no
injury
it
may
not
be
improper
to
add
that
to
preserve
this
state
of
things
and
give
confidence
to
the
world
in
the
integrity
of
our
designs
all
our
consular
and
diplomatic
agents
are
strictly
enjoined
to
examine
well
every
cause
of
complaint
preferred
by
our
citizens
and
while
they
urge
with
proper
earnestness
those
that
are
well
founded
to
countenance
none
that
are
unreasonable
or
unjust
and
to
enjoin
on
our
merchants
and
navigators
the
strictest
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
countries
to
which
they
resort
and
a
course
of
conduct
in
their
dealings
that
may
support
the
character
of
our
nation
and
render
us
respected
abroad
connected
with
this
subject
i
must
recommend
a
revisal
of
our
consular
laws
defects
and
omissions
have
been
discovered
in
their
operation
that
ought
to
be
remedied
and
supplied
for
your
further
information
on
this
subject
i
have
directed
a
report
to
be
made
by
the
secretary
of
state
which
i
shall
hereafter
submit
to
your
consideration
the
internal
peace
and
security
of
our
confederated
states
is
the
next
principal
object
of
the
general
government
time
and
experience
have
proved
that
the
abode
of
the
native
indian
within
their
limits
is
dangerous
to
their
peace
and
injurious
to
himself
in
accordance
with
my
recommendation
at
a
former
session
of
congress
an
appropriation
of
thousand
was
made
to
aid
the
voluntary
removal
of
the
various
tribes
beyond
the
limits
of
the
states
at
the
last
session
i
had
the
happiness
to
announce
that
the
chickasaws
and
choctaws
had
accepted
the
generous
offer
of
the
government
and
agreed
to
remove
beyond
the
mississippi
river
by
which
the
whole
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
western
part
of
alabama
will
be
freed
from
indian
occupancy
and
opened
to
a
civilized
population
the
treaties
with
these
tribes
are
in
a
course
of
execution
and
their
removal
it
is
hoped
will
be
completed
in
the
course
of
at
the
request
of
the
authorities
of
georgia
the
registration
of
cherokee
indians
for
emigration
has
been
resumed
and
it
is
confidently
expected
that
half
if
not
twothird
of
that
tribe
will
follow
the
wise
example
of
their
more
westerly
brethren
those
who
prefer
remaining
at
their
pre
sent
homes
will
hereafter
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
georgia
as
all
her
citizens
are
and
cease
to
be
the
objects
of
peculiar
care
on
the
part
of
the
general
government
during
the
present
year
the
attention
of
the
government
has
been
particularly
directed
to
those
tribes
in
the
powerful
and
growing
state
of
ohio
where
considerable
tracts
of
the
finest
lands
were
still
occupied
by
the
aboriginal
proprietors
treaties
either
absolute
or
conditional
have
been
made
extinguishing
the
whole
indian
title
to
the
reservations
in
that
state
and
the
time
is
not
distant
it
is
hoped
when
ohio
will
be
no
longer
embarrassed
with
the
indian
population
the
same
measures
will
be
extended
to
indiana
as
soon
as
there
is
reason
to
anticipate
success
it
is
confidently
believed
that
perseverance
for
a
few
years
in
the
present
policy
of
the
government
will
extinguish
the
indian
title
to
all
lands
lying
within
the
states
composing
our
federal
union
and
remove
beyond
their
limits
every
indian
who
is
not
willing
to
submit
to
their
laws
thus
will
all
conflicting
claims
to
jurisdiction
between
the
states
and
the
indian
tribes
be
put
to
rest
it
is
pleasing
to
reflect
that
results
so
beneficial
not
only
to
the
states
immediately
concerned
but
to
the
harmony
of
the
union
will
have
been
accomplished
by
measures
equally
advantageous
to
the
indians
what
the
native
savages
become
when
surrounded
by
a
dense
population
and
by
mixing
with
the
whites
may
be
seen
in
the
miserable
remnants
of
a
few
eastern
tribes
deprived
of
political
and
civil
rights
forbidden
to
make
contracts
and
subjected
to
guardians
dragging
out
a
wretched
existence
without
excitement
without
hope
and
almost
without
thought
but
the
removal
of
the
indians
beyond
the
limits
and
jurisdiction
of
the
states
does
not
place
them
beyond
the
reach
of
philanthropic
aid
and
christian
instruction
on
the
contrary
those
whom
philanthropy
or
religion
may
induce
to
live
among
them
in
their
new
abode
will
be
more
free
in
the
exercise
of
their
benevolent
functions
than
if
they
had
remained
within
the
limits
of
the
states
embarrassed
by
their
internal
regulations
now
subject
to
no
control
but
the
superintending
agency
of
the
general
government
exercised
with
the
sole
view
of
preserving
peace
they
may
proceed
unmolested
in
the
interesting
experiment
of
gradually
advancing
a
community
of
american
indians
from
barbarism
to
the
habits
and
enjoyments
of
civilized
life
among
the
happiest
effects
of
the
improved
relations
of
our
republic
has
been
an
increase
of
trade
producing
a
corresponding
increase
of
revenue
beyond
the
most
sanguine
anticipations
of
the
treasury
department
the
state
of
the
public
finances
will
be
fully
shown
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
the
report
which
he
will
presently
lay
before
you
i
will
here
however
congratulate
you
upon
their
prosperous
condition
the
revenue
received
in
the
present
year
will
not
fall
short
of
and
the
expenditures
for
all
objects
other
than
the
public
debt
will
not
exceed
the
payment
on
account
of
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
debt
during
the
year
will
exceed
a
greater
sum
than
has
been
applied
to
that
object
out
of
the
revenue
in
any
year
since
the
enlargement
of
the
sinking
fund
except
the
two
years
following
immediately
there
after
the
amount
which
will
have
been
applied
to
the
public
debt
from
march
th
to
january
st
which
is
less
than
three
years
since
the
administration
has
been
placed
in
my
hands
will
exceed
from
the
large
importations
of
the
present
year
it
may
be
safely
estimated
that
the
revenue
which
will
be
received
into
the
treasury
from
that
source
during
the
next
year
with
the
aid
of
that
received
from
the
public
lands
will
considerably
exceed
the
amount
of
the
receipts
of
the
present
year
and
it
is
believed
that
with
the
means
which
the
government
will
have
at
its
disposal
from
various
sources
which
will
be
fully
stated
by
the
proper
department
the
whole
of
the
public
debt
may
be
extinguished
either
by
redemption
or
purchase
within
the
four
years
of
my
administration
we
shall
then
exhibit
the
rare
example
of
a
great
nation
abounding
in
all
the
means
of
happiness
and
security
altogether
free
from
debt
the
confidence
with
which
the
extinguishment
of
the
public
debt
may
be
anticipated
presents
an
opportunity
for
carrying
into
effect
more
fully
the
policy
in
relation
to
import
duties
which
has
been
recommended
in
my
former
messages
a
modification
of
the
tariff
which
shall
produce
a
reduction
of
our
revenue
to
the
wants
of
the
government
and
an
adjustment
of
the
duties
on
imports
with
a
view
to
equal
justice
in
relation
to
all
our
national
interests
and
to
the
counteraction
of
foreign
policy
so
far
as
it
may
be
injurious
to
those
interests
is
deemed
to
be
one
of
the
principal
objects
which
demand
the
consideration
of
the
present
congress
justice
to
the
interests
of
the
merchant
as
well
as
the
manufacturer
requires
that
material
reductions
in
the
import
duties
be
prospective
and
unless
the
present
congress
shall
dispose
of
the
subject
the
proposed
reductions
can
not
properly
be
made
to
take
effect
at
the
period
when
the
necessity
for
the
revenue
arising
from
present
rates
shall
cease
it
is
therefore
desirable
that
arrangements
be
adopted
at
your
present
session
to
relieve
the
people
from
unnecessary
taxation
after
the
extinguishment
of
the
public
debt
in
the
exercise
of
that
spirit
of
concession
and
conciliation
which
has
distinguished
the
friends
of
our
union
in
all
great
emergencies
it
is
believed
that
this
object
may
be
effected
without
injury
to
any
national
interest
in
my
annual
message
of
december
i
had
the
honor
to
recommend
the
adoption
of
a
more
liberal
policy
than
that
which
then
prevailed
toward
unfortunate
debtors
to
the
government
and
i
deem
it
my
duty
again
to
invite
your
attention
to
this
subject
actuated
by
similar
views
congress
at
their
last
session
passed
an
act
for
the
relief
of
certain
insolvent
debtors
of
the
united
states
but
the
provisions
of
that
law
have
not
been
deemed
such
as
were
adequate
to
that
relief
to
this
unfortunate
class
of
our
fellow
citizens
which
may
be
safely
extended
to
them
the
points
in
which
the
law
appears
to
be
defective
will
be
particularly
communicated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
i
take
pleasure
in
recommending
such
an
extension
of
its
provisions
as
will
unfetter
the
enterprise
of
a
valuable
portion
of
our
citizens
and
restore
to
them
the
means
of
usefulness
to
themselves
and
the
community
while
deliberating
on
this
subject
i
would
also
recommend
to
your
consideration
the
propriety
of
so
modifying
the
laws
for
enforcing
the
payment
of
debts
due
either
to
the
public
or
to
individuals
suing
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
as
to
restrict
the
imprisonment
of
the
person
to
cases
of
fraudulent
concealment
of
property
the
personal
liberty
of
the
citizen
seems
too
sacred
to
be
held
as
in
many
cases
it
now
is
at
the
will
of
a
creditor
to
whom
he
is
willing
to
surrender
all
the
means
he
has
of
discharging
his
debt
the
reports
from
the
secretaries
of
the
war
and
navy
departments
and
from
the
post
master
general
which
accompany
this
message
present
satisfactory
views
of
the
operations
of
the
departments
respectively
under
their
charge
and
suggest
improvements
which
are
worthy
of
and
to
which
i
invite
the
serious
attention
of
congress
certain
defects
and
omissions
having
been
discovered
in
the
operation
of
the
laws
respecting
patents
they
are
pointed
out
in
the
accompanying
report
from
the
secretary
of
state
i
have
heretofore
recommended
amendments
of
the
federal
constitution
giving
the
election
of
president
and
vicepresident
to
the
people
and
limiting
the
service
of
the
former
to
a
single
term
so
important
do
i
consider
these
changes
in
our
fundamental
law
that
i
can
not
in
accordance
with
my
sense
of
duty
omit
to
press
them
upon
the
consideration
of
a
new
congress
for
my
views
more
at
large
as
well
in
relation
to
these
points
as
to
the
disqualification
of
members
of
congress
to
receive
an
office
from
a
president
in
whose
election
they
have
had
an
official
agency
which
i
proposed
as
a
substitute
i
refer
you
to
my
former
messages
our
system
of
public
accounts
is
extremely
complicated
and
it
is
believed
may
be
much
improved
much
of
the
present
machinery
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
expenditure
of
public
money
may
be
dispensed
with
while
greater
facilities
can
be
afforded
to
the
liquidation
of
claims
upon
the
government
and
an
examination
into
their
justice
and
legality
quite
as
efficient
as
the
present
secured
with
a
view
to
a
general
reform
in
the
system
i
recommend
the
subject
to
the
attention
of
congress
i
deem
it
my
duty
again
to
call
your
attention
to
the
condition
of
the
district
of
columbia
it
was
doubtless
wise
in
the
framers
of
our
constitution
to
place
the
people
of
this
district
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
general
government
but
to
accomplish
the
objects
they
had
in
view
it
is
not
necessary
that
this
people
should
be
deprived
of
all
the
privileges
of
selfgovernment
independently
of
the
difficulty
of
inducing
the
representatives
of
distant
states
to
turn
their
attention
to
projects
of
laws
which
are
not
of
the
highest
interest
to
their
constituents
they
are
not
individually
nor
in
congress
collectively
well
qualified
to
legislate
over
the
local
concerns
of
this
district
consequently
its
interests
are
much
neglected
and
the
people
are
almost
afraid
to
present
their
grievances
lest
a
body
in
which
they
are
not
represented
and
which
feels
little
sympathy
in
their
local
relations
should
in
its
attempt
to
make
laws
for
them
do
more
harm
than
good
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
states
whence
they
were
severed
the
two
shores
of
the
potomac
within
the
ten
miles
square
have
different
penal
codesnot
the
present
codes
of
virginia
and
maryland
but
such
as
existed
in
those
states
at
the
time
of
the
cession
to
the
united
states
as
congress
will
not
form
a
new
code
and
as
the
people
of
the
district
can
not
make
one
for
themselves
they
are
virtually
under
two
governments
is
it
not
just
to
allow
th
em
at
least
a
delegate
in
congress
if
not
a
local
legislature
to
make
laws
for
the
district
subject
to
the
approval
or
rejection
of
congress
i
earnestly
recommend
the
extension
to
them
of
every
political
right
which
their
interests
require
and
which
may
be
compatible
with
the
constitution
the
extension
of
the
judiciary
system
of
the
united
states
is
deemed
to
be
one
of
the
duties
of
the
government
onefourth
of
the
states
in
the
union
do
not
participate
in
the
benefits
of
a
circuit
court
to
the
states
of
indiana
illinois
missouri
alabama
mississippi
and
louisiana
admitted
into
the
union
since
the
present
judicial
system
was
organized
only
a
district
court
has
been
allowed
if
this
be
sufficient
then
the
circuit
courts
already
existing
in
states
ought
to
be
abolished
if
it
be
not
sufficient
the
defect
ought
to
be
remedied
and
these
states
placed
on
the
same
footing
with
the
other
members
of
the
union
it
was
on
this
condition
and
on
this
footing
that
they
entered
the
union
and
they
may
demand
circuit
courts
as
a
matter
not
of
concession
but
of
right
i
trust
that
congress
will
not
adjourn
leaving
this
anomaly
in
our
system
entertaining
the
opinions
heretofore
expressed
in
relation
to
the
bank
of
the
united
states
as
at
present
organized
i
felt
it
my
duty
in
my
former
messages
frankly
to
disclose
them
in
order
that
the
attention
of
the
legislature
and
the
people
should
be
seasonably
directed
to
that
important
subject
and
that
it
might
be
considered
and
finally
disposed
of
in
a
manner
best
calculated
to
promote
the
ends
of
the
constitution
and
subserve
the
public
interests
having
thus
conscientiously
discharged
a
constitutional
duty
i
deem
it
proper
on
this
occasion
without
a
more
particular
reference
to
the
views
of
the
subject
then
expressed
to
leave
it
for
the
present
to
the
investigation
of
an
enlightened
people
and
their
representatives
in
conclusion
permit
me
to
invoke
that
power
which
superintends
all
governments
to
infuse
into
your
deliberations
at
this
important
crisis
of
our
history
a
spirit
of
mutual
forbearance
and
conciliation
in
that
spirit
was
our
union
formed
and
in
that
spirit
must
it
be
preserved

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
pleasure
i
have
in
congratulating
you
upon
your
return
to
your
constitutional
duties
is
much
heightened
by
the
satisfaction
which
the
condition
of
our
beloved
country
at
this
period
justly
inspires
the
beneficent
author
of
all
good
has
granted
to
us
during
the
present
year
health
peace
and
plenty
and
numerous
causes
for
joy
in
the
wonderful
success
which
attends
the
progress
of
our
free
institutions
with
a
population
unparalleled
in
its
increase
and
possessing
a
character
which
combines
the
hardihood
of
enterprise
with
the
considerateness
of
wisdom
we
see
in
every
section
of
our
happy
country
a
steady
improvement
in
the
means
of
social
intercourse
and
correspondent
effects
upon
the
genius
and
laws
of
our
extended
republic
the
apparent
exceptions
to
the
harmony
of
the
prospect
are
to
be
referred
rather
to
inevitable
diversities
in
the
various
interests
which
enter
into
the
composition
of
so
extensive
a
whole
than
any
want
of
attachment
to
the
unioninterests
whose
collisions
serve
only
in
the
end
to
foster
the
spirit
of
conciliation
and
patriotism
so
essential
to
the
preservation
of
that
union
which
i
most
devoutly
hope
is
destined
to
prove
imperishable
in
the
midst
of
these
blessings
we
have
recently
witnessed
changes
in
the
conditions
of
other
nations
which
may
in
their
consequences
call
for
the
utmost
vigilance
wisdom
and
unanimity
in
our
councils
and
the
exercise
of
all
the
moderation
and
patriotism
of
our
people
the
important
modifications
of
their
government
effected
with
so
much
courage
and
wisdom
by
the
people
of
france
afford
a
happy
presage
of
their
future
course
and
have
naturally
elicited
from
the
kindred
feelings
of
this
nation
that
spontaneous
and
universal
burst
of
applause
in
which
you
have
participated
in
congratulating
you
my
fellow
citizens
upon
an
event
so
auspicious
to
the
dearest
interests
of
mankind
i
do
no
more
than
respond
to
the
voice
of
my
country
without
transcending
in
the
slightest
degree
that
salutary
maxim
of
the
illustrious
washington
which
enjoins
an
abstinence
from
all
interference
with
the
internal
affairs
of
other
nations
from
a
people
exercising
in
the
most
unlimited
degree
the
right
of
selfgovernment
and
enjoying
as
derived
from
this
proud
characteristic
under
the
favor
of
heaven
much
of
the
happiness
with
which
they
are
blessed
a
people
who
can
point
in
triumph
to
their
free
institutions
and
challenge
comparison
with
the
fruits
they
bear
as
well
as
with
the
moderation
intelligence
and
energy
with
which
they
are
administered
from
such
a
people
the
deepest
sympathy
was
to
be
expected
in
a
struggle
for
the
sacred
principles
of
liberty
conducted
in
a
spirit
every
way
worthy
of
the
cause
and
crowned
by
a
heroic
moderation
which
has
disarmed
revolution
of
its
terrors
not
withstanding
the
strong
assurances
which
the
man
whom
we
so
sincerely
love
and
justly
admire
has
given
to
the
world
of
the
high
character
of
the
present
king
of
the
french
and
which
if
sustained
to
the
end
will
secure
to
him
the
proud
appellation
of
patriot
king
it
is
not
in
his
success
but
in
that
of
the
great
principle
which
has
borne
him
to
the
thronethe
paramount
authority
of
the
public
willthat
the
american
people
rejoice
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
the
anticipations
which
were
indulged
at
the
date
of
my
last
communication
on
the
subject
of
our
foreign
affairs
have
been
fully
realized
in
several
important
particulars
an
arrangement
has
been
effected
with
great
britain
in
relation
to
the
trade
between
the
united
states
and
her
west
india
and
north
american
colonies
which
has
settled
a
question
that
has
for
years
afforded
matter
for
contention
and
almost
uninterrupted
discussion
and
has
been
the
subject
of
no
less
than
six
negotiations
in
a
manner
which
promises
results
highly
favorable
to
the
parties
the
abstract
right
of
great
britain
to
monopolize
the
trade
with
her
colonies
or
to
exclude
us
from
a
participation
therein
has
never
been
denied
by
the
united
states
but
we
have
contended
and
with
reason
that
if
at
any
time
great
britain
may
desire
the
productions
of
this
country
as
necessary
to
her
colonies
they
must
be
received
upon
principles
of
just
reciprocity
and
further
that
it
is
making
an
invidious
and
unfriendly
distinction
to
open
her
colonial
ports
to
the
vessels
of
other
nations
and
close
them
against
those
of
the
united
states
antecedently
to
a
portion
of
our
productions
was
admitted
into
the
colonial
islands
of
great
britain
by
particular
concessions
limited
to
the
term
of
one
year
but
renewed
from
year
to
year
in
the
transportation
of
these
productions
however
our
vessels
were
not
allowed
to
engage
this
being
a
privilege
reserved
to
british
shipping
by
which
alone
our
produce
could
be
taken
to
the
islands
and
theirs
brought
to
us
in
return
from
newfoundland
and
her
continental
possessions
all
our
productions
as
well
as
our
vessels
were
excluded
with
occasional
relaxations
by
which
in
seasons
of
distress
the
former
were
admitted
in
british
bottoms
by
the
treaty
of
she
offered
to
concede
to
us
for
a
limited
time
the
right
of
carrying
to
her
west
india
possessions
in
our
vessels
not
exceeding
tons
burthen
and
upon
the
same
terms
as
british
vessels
any
productions
of
the
united
states
which
british
vessels
might
import
therefrom
but
this
privilege
was
coupled
with
conditions
which
are
supposed
to
have
led
to
its
rejection
by
the
senate
that
is
that
american
vessels
should
land
their
return
cargoes
in
the
united
states
only
and
moreover
that
they
should
during
the
continuance
of
the
privilege
be
precluded
from
carrying
molasses
sugar
coffee
cocoa
or
cotton
either
from
those
islands
or
from
the
united
states
to
any
other
part
of
the
world
great
britain
readily
consented
to
expunge
this
article
from
the
treaty
and
subsequent
attempts
to
arrange
the
terms
of
the
trade
either
by
treaty
stipulations
or
concerted
legislation
have
failed
it
has
been
successively
suspended
and
allowed
according
to
the
varying
legislation
of
the
parties
the
following
are
the
prominent
points
which
have
in
later
years
separated
the
two
governments
besides
a
restriction
whereby
all
importations
into
her
colonies
in
american
vessels
are
confined
to
our
own
products
carried
hence
a
restriction
to
which
it
does
not
appear
that
we
have
ever
objected
a
leading
object
on
the
part
of
great
britain
has
been
to
prevent
us
from
becoming
the
carriers
of
british
west
india
commodities
to
any
other
country
than
our
own
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
it
has
been
contended
first
that
the
subject
should
be
regulated
by
treaty
stipulation
in
preference
to
separate
legislation
second
that
our
productions
when
imported
into
the
colonies
in
question
should
not
be
subject
to
higher
duties
than
the
productions
of
the
mother
country
or
of
her
other
colonial
possessions
and
rd
that
our
vessels
should
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
circuitous
trade
between
the
united
states
and
different
parts
of
the
british
dominions
the
first
point
after
having
been
for
a
long
time
strenuously
insisted
upon
by
great
britain
was
given
up
by
the
act
of
parliament
of
july
all
vessels
suffered
to
trade
with
the
colonies
being
permitted
to
clear
from
thence
with
any
articles
which
british
vessels
might
export
and
proceed
to
any
part
of
the
world
great
britain
and
her
dependencies
alone
excepted
on
our
part
each
of
the
above
points
had
in
succession
been
explicitly
abandoned
in
negotiations
preceding
that
of
which
the
result
is
now
announced
this
arrangement
secures
to
the
united
states
every
advantage
asked
by
them
and
which
the
state
of
the
negotiation
allowed
us
to
insist
upon
the
trade
will
be
placed
upon
a
footing
decidedly
more
favorable
to
this
country
than
any
on
which
it
ever
stood
and
our
commerce
and
navigation
will
enjoy
in
the
colonial
ports
of
great
britain
every
privilege
allowed
to
other
nations
that
the
prosperity
of
the
country
so
far
as
it
depends
on
this
trade
will
be
greatly
promoted
by
the
new
arrangement
there
can
be
no
doubt
independently
of
the
more
obvious
advantages
of
an
open
and
direct
intercourse
its
establishment
will
be
attended
with
other
consequences
of
a
higher
value
that
which
has
been
carried
on
since
the
mutual
interdict
under
all
the
expense
and
inconvenience
unavoidably
incident
to
it
would
have
been
insupportably
onerous
had
it
not
been
in
a
great
degree
lightened
by
concerted
evasions
in
the
mode
of
making
the
transshipments
at
what
are
called
the
neutral
ports
these
indirections
are
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
nations
that
have
so
many
motives
not
only
to
cherish
feelings
of
mutual
friendship
but
to
maintain
such
relations
as
will
stimulate
their
respective
citizens
and
subjects
to
efforts
of
direct
open
and
honorable
competition
only
and
preserve
them
from
the
influence
of
seductive
and
vitiating
circumstances
when
your
preliminary
interposition
was
asked
at
the
close
of
the
last
session
a
copy
of
the
instructions
under
which
mr
mclane
has
acted
together
with
the
communications
which
had
at
that
time
passed
between
him
and
the
british
government
was
laid
before
you
although
there
has
not
been
any
thing
in
the
acts
of
the
two
governments
which
requires
secrecy
it
was
thought
most
proper
in
the
then
state
of
the
negotiation
to
make
that
communication
a
confidential
one
so
soon
however
as
the
evidence
of
execution
on
the
part
of
great
britain
is
received
the
whole
matter
shall
be
laid
before
you
when
it
will
be
seen
that
the
apprehension
which
appears
to
have
suggested
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
passed
at
your
last
session
that
the
restoration
of
the
trade
in
question
might
be
connected
with
other
subjects
and
was
sought
to
be
obtained
at
the
sacrifice
of
the
public
interest
in
other
particulars
was
wholly
unfounded
and
that
the
change
which
has
taken
place
in
the
views
of
the
british
government
has
been
induced
by
considerations
as
honorable
to
both
parties
as
i
trust
the
result
will
prove
beneficial
this
desirable
result
was
it
will
be
seen
gr
eatly
promoted
by
the
liberal
and
confiding
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
of
the
last
session
by
which
our
ports
were
upon
the
reception
and
annunciation
by
the
president
of
the
required
assurance
on
the
part
of
great
britain
forthwith
opened
to
her
vessels
before
the
arrangement
could
be
carried
into
effect
on
her
part
pursuing
in
this
act
of
prospective
legislation
a
similar
course
to
that
adopted
by
great
britain
in
abolishing
by
her
act
of
parliament
in
a
restriction
then
existing
and
permitting
our
vessels
to
clear
from
the
colonies
on
their
return
voyages
for
any
foreign
country
whatever
before
british
vessels
had
been
relieved
from
the
restriction
imposed
by
our
law
of
returning
directly
from
the
united
states
to
the
colonies
a
restriction
which
she
required
and
expected
that
we
should
abolish
upon
each
occasion
a
limited
and
temporary
advantage
has
been
given
to
the
opposite
party
but
an
advantage
of
no
importance
in
comparison
with
the
restoration
of
mutual
confidence
and
good
feeling
and
the
ultimate
establishment
of
the
trade
upon
fair
principles
it
gives
me
unfeigned
pleasure
to
assure
you
that
this
negotiation
has
been
throughout
characterized
by
the
most
frank
and
friendly
spirit
on
the
part
of
great
britain
and
concluded
in
a
manner
strongly
indicative
of
a
sincere
desire
to
cultivate
the
best
relations
with
the
united
states
to
reciprocate
this
disposition
to
the
fullest
extent
of
my
ability
is
a
duty
which
i
shall
deem
it
a
privilege
to
discharge
although
the
result
is
itself
the
best
commentary
on
the
services
rendered
to
his
country
by
our
minister
at
the
court
of
st
james
it
would
be
doing
violence
to
my
feelings
were
i
to
dismiss
the
subject
without
expressing
the
very
high
sense
i
entertain
of
the
talent
and
exertion
which
have
been
displayed
by
him
on
the
occasion
the
injury
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
resulting
from
the
exclusion
of
our
vessels
from
the
black
sea
and
the
previous
footing
of
mere
sufferance
upon
which
even
the
limited
trade
enjoyed
by
us
with
turkey
has
hitherto
been
placed
have
for
a
long
time
been
a
source
of
much
solicitude
to
this
government
and
several
endeavors
have
been
made
to
obtain
a
better
state
of
things
sensible
of
the
importance
of
the
object
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
leave
no
proper
means
unemployed
to
acquire
for
our
flag
the
same
privileges
that
are
enjoyed
by
the
principal
powers
of
europe
commissioners
were
consequently
appointed
to
open
a
negotiation
with
the
sublime
porte
not
long
after
the
member
of
the
commission
who
went
directly
from
the
united
states
had
sailed
the
account
of
the
treaty
of
adrianople
by
which
one
of
the
objects
in
view
was
supposed
to
be
secured
reached
this
country
the
black
sea
was
understood
to
be
opened
to
us
under
the
supposition
that
this
was
the
case
the
additional
facilities
to
be
derived
from
the
establishment
of
commercial
regulations
with
the
porte
were
deemed
of
sufficient
importance
to
require
a
prosecution
of
the
negotiation
as
originally
contemplated
it
was
therefore
persevered
in
and
resulted
in
a
treaty
which
will
be
forthwith
laid
before
the
senate
by
its
provisions
a
free
passage
is
secured
without
limitations
of
time
to
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
to
and
from
the
black
sea
including
the
navigation
thereof
and
our
trade
with
turkey
is
placed
on
the
footing
of
the
most
favored
nation
the
latter
is
an
arrangement
wholly
independent
of
the
treaty
of
adrianople
and
the
former
derives
much
value
not
only
from
the
increased
security
which
under
any
circumstances
it
would
give
to
the
right
in
question
but
from
the
fact
ascertained
in
the
course
of
the
negotiation
that
by
the
construction
put
upon
that
treaty
by
turkey
the
article
relating
to
the
passage
of
the
bosphorus
is
confined
to
nations
having
treaties
with
the
porte
the
most
friendly
feelings
appear
to
be
entertained
by
the
sultan
and
an
enlightened
disposition
is
evinced
by
him
to
foster
the
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
by
the
most
liberal
arrangements
this
disposition
it
will
be
our
duty
and
interest
to
cherish
our
relations
with
russia
are
of
the
most
stable
character
respect
for
that
empire
and
confidence
in
its
friendship
toward
the
united
states
have
been
so
long
entertained
on
our
part
and
so
carefully
cherished
by
the
present
emperor
and
his
illustrious
predecessor
as
to
have
become
incorporated
with
the
public
sentiment
of
the
united
states
no
means
will
be
left
unemployed
on
my
part
to
promote
these
salutary
feelings
and
those
improvements
of
which
the
commercial
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
is
susceptible
and
which
have
derived
increased
importance
from
our
treaty
with
the
sublime
porte
i
sincerely
regret
to
inform
you
that
our
minister
lately
commissioned
to
that
court
on
whose
distinguished
talents
and
great
experience
in
public
affairs
i
place
great
reliance
has
been
compelled
by
extreme
indisposition
to
exercise
a
privilege
which
in
consideration
of
the
extent
to
which
his
constitution
had
been
impaired
in
the
public
service
was
committed
to
his
discretionof
leaving
temporarily
his
post
for
the
advantage
of
a
more
genial
climate
if
as
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
improvement
of
his
health
should
be
such
as
to
justify
him
in
doing
so
he
will
repair
to
st
petersburg
and
resume
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties
i
have
received
the
most
satisfactory
assurances
that
in
the
mean
time
the
public
interest
in
that
quarter
will
be
preserved
from
prejudice
by
the
intercourse
which
he
will
continue
through
the
secretary
of
legation
with
the
russian
cabinet
you
are
apprised
although
the
fact
has
not
yet
been
officially
announced
to
the
house
of
representatives
that
a
treaty
was
in
the
month
of
march
last
concluded
between
the
united
states
and
denmark
by
which
thousand
are
secured
to
our
citizens
as
an
indemnity
for
spoliations
upon
their
commerce
in
the
years
and
this
treaty
was
sanctioned
by
the
senate
at
the
close
of
its
last
session
and
it
now
becomes
the
duty
of
congress
to
pass
the
necessary
laws
for
the
organization
of
the
board
of
commissioners
to
distribute
the
indemnity
among
the
claimants
it
is
an
agreeable
circumstance
in
this
adjustment
that
the
terms
are
in
conformity
with
the
previously
ascertained
views
of
the
claimants
themselves
thus
removing
all
pretense
for
a
future
agitation
of
the
subject
in
any
form
the
negotiations
in
regard
to
such
points
in
our
foreign
relations
as
remain
to
be
adjusted
have
been
actively
prosecuted
during
the
recess
material
advances
have
been
made
which
are
of
a
character
to
promise
favorable
results
our
country
by
the
blessing
of
god
is
not
in
a
situation
to
invite
aggression
and
it
will
be
our
fault
if
she
ever
becomes
so
sincerely
desirous
to
cultivate
the
most
liberal
and
friendly
relations
with
all
ever
ready
to
fulfill
our
engagements
with
scrupulous
fidelity
limiting
our
demands
upon
others
to
mere
justice
holding
ourselves
ever
ready
to
do
unto
them
as
we
would
wish
to
be
done
by
and
avoiding
even
the
appearance
of
undue
partiality
to
any
nation
it
appears
to
me
impossible
that
a
simple
and
sincere
application
of
our
principles
to
our
foreign
relations
can
fail
to
place
them
ultimately
upon
the
footing
on
which
it
is
our
wish
they
should
rest
of
the
points
referred
to
the
most
prominent
are
our
claims
upon
france
for
spoliations
upon
our
commerce
similar
claims
upon
spain
together
with
embarrassments
in
the
commercial
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
which
ought
to
be
removed
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
with
mexico
which
has
been
so
long
in
suspense
as
well
as
the
final
settlement
of
limits
between
ourselves
and
that
republic
and
finally
the
arbitrament
of
the
question
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
in
regard
to
the
northeastern
boundary
the
negotiation
with
france
has
been
conducted
by
our
minister
with
zeal
and
ability
and
in
all
respects
to
my
entire
satisfaction
although
the
prospect
of
a
favorable
termination
was
occasionally
dimmed
by
counter
pretensions
to
which
the
united
states
could
not
assent
he
yet
had
strong
hopes
of
being
able
to
arrive
at
a
satisfactory
settlement
with
the
late
government
the
negotiation
has
been
renewed
with
the
present
authorities
and
sensible
of
the
general
and
lively
confidence
of
our
citizens
in
the
justice
and
magnanimity
of
regenerated
france
i
regret
the
more
not
to
have
it
in
my
power
yet
to
announce
the
result
so
confidently
anticipated
no
ground
however
inconsistent
with
this
expectation
has
yet
been
taken
and
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
doubt
that
justice
will
soon
be
done
us
the
amount
of
the
claims
the
length
of
time
they
have
remained
unsatisfied
and
their
incontrovertible
justice
make
an
earnest
prosecution
of
them
by
this
government
an
urgent
duty
the
illegality
of
the
seizures
and
confiscations
out
of
which
they
have
arisen
is
not
disputed
and
what
ever
distinctions
may
have
heretofore
been
set
up
in
regard
to
the
liability
of
the
existing
government
it
is
quite
clear
that
such
considerations
can
not
now
be
interposed
the
commercial
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
is
susceptible
of
highly
advantageous
improvements
but
the
sense
of
this
injury
has
had
and
must
continue
to
have
a
very
unfavorable
influence
upon
them
from
its
satisfactory
adjustment
not
only
a
firm
and
cordial
friendship
but
a
progressive
development
of
all
their
relations
may
be
expected
it
is
therefore
my
earnest
hope
that
this
old
and
vexatious
subject
of
difference
may
be
speedily
removed
i
feel
that
my
confidence
in
our
appeal
to
the
motives
which
should
govern
a
just
and
magnanimous
nation
is
alike
warranted
by
the
character
of
the
french
people
and
by
the
high
voucher
we
possess
for
the
enlarged
views
and
pure
integrity
of
the
monarch
who
now
presides
over
their
councils
and
nothing
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
to
meet
any
manifestation
of
the
spirit
we
anticipate
in
one
of
corresponding
frankness
and
liberality
the
subjects
of
difference
with
spain
have
been
brought
to
the
view
of
that
government
by
our
minist
er
there
with
much
force
and
propriety
and
the
strongest
assurances
have
been
received
of
their
early
and
favorable
consideration
the
steps
which
remained
to
place
the
matter
in
controversy
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
fairly
before
the
arbitrator
have
all
been
taken
in
the
same
liberal
and
friendly
spirit
which
characterized
those
before
announced
recent
events
have
doubtless
served
to
delay
the
decision
but
our
minister
at
the
court
of
the
distinguished
arbitrator
has
been
assured
that
it
will
be
made
within
the
time
contemplated
by
the
treaty
i
am
particularly
gratified
in
being
able
to
state
that
a
decidedly
favorable
and
as
i
hope
lasting
change
has
been
effected
in
our
relations
with
the
neighboring
republic
of
mexico
the
unfortunate
and
unfounded
suspicions
in
regard
to
our
disposition
which
it
became
my
painful
duty
to
advert
to
on
a
former
occasion
have
been
i
believe
entirely
removed
and
the
government
of
mexico
has
been
made
to
understand
the
real
character
of
the
wishes
and
views
of
this
in
regard
to
that
country
the
consequences
is
the
establishment
of
friendship
and
mutual
confidence
such
are
the
assurances
i
have
received
and
i
see
no
cause
to
doubt
their
sincerity
i
had
reason
to
expect
the
conclusion
of
a
commercial
treaty
with
mexico
in
season
for
communication
on
the
present
occasion
circumstances
which
are
not
explained
but
which
i
am
persuaded
are
not
the
result
of
an
indisposition
on
her
part
to
enter
into
it
have
produced
the
delay
there
was
reason
to
fear
in
the
course
of
the
last
summer
that
the
harmony
of
our
relations
might
be
disturbed
by
the
acts
of
certain
claimants
under
mexican
grants
of
territory
which
had
hitherto
been
under
our
jurisdiction
the
cooperation
of
the
representative
of
mexico
near
this
government
was
asked
on
the
occasion
and
was
readily
afforded
instructions
and
advice
have
been
given
to
the
governor
of
arkansas
and
the
officers
in
command
in
the
adjoining
mexican
state
by
which
it
is
hoped
the
quiet
of
that
frontier
will
be
preserved
until
a
final
settlement
of
the
dividing
line
shall
have
removed
all
ground
of
controversy
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
the
treaty
concluded
last
year
with
austria
has
not
yet
taken
place
the
delay
has
been
occasioned
by
the
nonarrival
of
the
ratification
of
that
government
within
the
time
prescribed
by
the
treaty
renewed
authority
has
been
asked
for
by
the
representative
of
austria
and
in
the
mean
time
the
rapidly
increasing
trade
and
navigation
between
the
two
countries
have
been
placed
upon
the
most
liberal
footing
of
our
navigation
acts
several
alleged
depredations
have
been
recently
committed
on
our
commerce
by
the
national
vessels
of
portugal
they
have
been
made
the
subject
of
immediate
remonstrance
and
reclamation
i
am
not
yet
possessed
of
sufficient
information
to
express
a
definitive
opinion
of
their
character
but
expect
soon
to
receive
it
no
proper
means
shall
be
omitted
to
obtain
for
our
citizens
all
the
redress
to
which
they
may
appear
to
be
entitled
almost
at
the
moment
of
the
adjournment
of
your
last
session
two
billsthe
one
entitled
an
act
for
making
appropriations
for
building
light
houses
light
boats
beacons
and
monuments
placing
buoys
and
for
improving
harbors
and
directing
surveys
and
the
other
an
act
to
authorize
a
subscription
for
stock
in
the
louisville
and
portland
canal
companywere
submitted
for
my
approval
it
was
not
possible
within
the
time
allowed
for
me
before
the
close
of
the
session
to
give
to
these
bills
the
consideration
which
was
due
to
their
character
and
importance
and
i
was
compelled
to
retain
them
for
that
purpose
i
now
avail
myself
of
this
early
opportunity
to
return
them
to
the
houses
in
which
they
respectively
originated
with
the
reasons
which
after
mature
deliberation
compel
me
to
withhold
my
approval
the
practice
of
defraying
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
the
expenses
incurred
by
the
establishment
and
support
of
light
houses
beacons
buoys
and
public
piers
within
the
bays
inlets
harbors
and
ports
of
the
united
states
to
render
the
navigation
thereof
safe
and
easy
is
coeval
with
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
has
been
continued
without
interruption
or
dispute
as
our
foreign
commerce
increased
and
was
extended
into
the
interior
of
the
country
by
the
establishment
of
ports
of
entry
and
delivery
upon
our
navigable
rivers
the
sphere
of
those
expenditures
received
a
corresponding
enlargement
light
houses
beacons
buoys
public
piers
and
the
removal
of
sand
bars
sawyers
and
other
partial
or
temporary
impediments
in
the
navigable
rivers
and
harbors
which
were
embraced
in
the
revenue
districts
from
time
to
time
established
by
law
were
authorized
upon
the
same
principle
and
the
expense
defrayed
in
the
same
manner
that
these
expenses
have
at
times
been
extravagant
and
disproportionate
is
very
probable
the
circumstances
under
which
they
are
incurred
are
well
calculated
to
lead
to
such
a
result
unless
their
application
is
subjected
to
the
closest
scrutiny
the
local
advantages
arising
from
the
disbursement
of
public
money
too
frequently
it
is
to
be
feared
invite
appropriations
for
objects
of
this
character
that
are
neither
necessary
nor
useful
the
number
of
light
house
keepers
is
already
very
large
and
the
bill
before
me
proposes
to
add
to
it
more
of
various
descriptions
from
representations
upon
the
subject
which
are
understood
to
be
entitled
to
respect
i
am
induced
to
believe
that
there
has
not
only
been
great
improvidence
in
the
past
expenditures
of
the
government
upon
these
objects
but
that
the
security
of
navigation
has
in
some
instances
been
diminished
by
the
multiplication
of
light
houses
and
consequent
change
of
lights
upon
the
coast
it
is
in
this
as
in
other
respects
our
duty
to
avoid
all
unnecessary
expense
as
well
as
every
increase
of
patronage
not
called
for
by
the
public
service
but
in
the
discharge
of
that
duty
in
this
particular
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
relation
to
our
foreign
commerce
the
burden
and
benefit
of
protecting
and
accommodating
it
necessarily
go
together
and
must
do
so
as
long
as
the
public
revenue
is
drawn
from
the
people
through
the
custom
house
it
is
indisputable
that
whatever
gives
facility
and
security
to
navigation
cheapens
imports
and
all
who
consume
them
are
alike
interested
in
what
ever
produces
this
effect
if
they
consume
they
ought
as
they
now
do
to
pay
otherwise
they
do
not
pay
the
consumer
in
the
most
inland
state
derives
the
same
advantage
from
every
necessary
and
prudent
expenditure
for
the
facility
and
security
of
our
foreign
commerce
and
navigation
that
he
does
who
resides
in
a
maritime
state
local
expenditures
have
not
of
themselves
a
corresponding
operation
from
a
bill
making
direct
appropriations
for
such
objects
i
should
not
have
withheld
my
assent
the
one
now
returned
does
so
in
several
particulars
but
it
also
contains
appropriations
for
surveys
of
local
character
which
i
can
not
approve
it
gives
me
satisfaction
to
find
that
no
serious
inconvenience
has
arisen
from
withholding
my
approval
from
this
bill
nor
will
it
i
trust
be
cause
of
regret
that
an
opportunity
will
be
thereby
afforded
for
congress
to
review
its
provisions
under
circumstances
better
calculated
for
full
investigation
than
those
under
which
it
was
passed
in
speaking
of
direct
appropriations
i
mean
not
to
include
a
practice
which
has
obtained
to
some
extent
and
to
which
i
have
in
one
instance
in
a
different
capacity
given
my
assentthat
of
subscribing
to
the
stock
of
private
associations
positive
experience
and
a
more
thorough
consideration
of
the
subject
have
convinced
me
of
the
impropriety
as
well
as
inexpediency
of
such
investments
all
improvements
effected
by
the
funds
of
the
nation
for
general
use
should
be
open
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
our
fellow
citizens
exempt
from
the
payment
of
tolls
or
any
imposition
of
that
character
the
practice
of
thus
mingling
the
concerns
of
the
government
with
those
of
the
states
or
of
individuals
is
inconsistent
with
the
object
of
its
institution
and
highly
impolite
the
successful
operation
of
the
federal
system
can
only
be
preserved
by
confining
it
to
the
few
and
simple
but
yet
important
objects
for
which
it
was
designed
a
different
practice
if
allowed
to
progress
would
ultimately
change
the
character
of
this
government
by
consolidating
into
one
the
general
and
state
governments
which
were
intended
to
be
kept
for
ever
distinct
i
can
not
perceive
how
bills
authorizing
such
subscriptions
can
be
otherwise
regarded
than
as
bills
for
revenue
and
consequently
subject
to
the
rule
in
that
respect
prescribed
by
the
constitution
if
the
interest
of
the
government
in
private
companies
is
subordinate
to
that
of
individuals
the
management
and
control
of
a
portion
of
the
public
funds
is
delegated
to
an
authority
unknown
to
the
constitution
and
beyond
the
supervision
of
our
constituents
if
superior
its
officers
and
agents
will
be
constantly
exposed
to
imputations
of
favoritism
and
oppression
direct
prejudice
the
public
interest
or
an
alienation
of
the
affections
and
respect
of
portions
of
the
people
may
therefore
in
addition
to
the
general
discredit
resulting
to
the
government
from
embarking
with
its
constituents
in
pecuniary
stipulations
be
looked
for
as
the
probable
fruit
of
such
associations
it
is
no
answer
to
this
objection
to
say
that
the
extent
of
consequences
like
these
can
not
be
great
from
a
limited
and
small
number
of
investments
because
experience
in
other
matters
teaches
usand
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
disregard
its
admonitionsthat
unless
an
entire
stop
be
put
to
them
it
will
soon
be
impossible
to
prevent
their
accumulation
until
they
are
spread
over
the
whole
country
and
made
to
embrace
many
of
the
private
and
appropriate
concerns
of
individuals
the
power
which
the
general
government
would
acquire
within
the
several
states
by
becoming
the
principal
stockholder
in
corporations
controlling
every
canal
and
each
or
miles
of
every
important
road
and
giving
a
proportionate
vote
in
all
their
elections
is
almost
inconceivable
and

in
my
view
dangerous
to
the
liberties
of
the
people
this
mode
of
aiding
such
works
is
also
in
its
nature
deceptive
and
in
many
cases
conducive
to
improvidence
in
the
administration
of
the
national
funds
appropriations
will
be
obtained
with
much
greater
facility
and
granted
with
less
security
to
the
public
interest
when
the
measure
is
thus
disguised
than
when
definite
and
direct
expenditures
of
money
are
asked
for
the
interests
of
the
nation
would
doubtless
be
better
served
by
avoiding
all
such
indirect
modes
of
aiding
particular
objects
in
a
government
like
ours
more
especially
should
all
public
acts
be
as
far
as
practicable
simple
undisguised
and
intelligible
that
they
may
become
fit
subjects
for
the
approbation
to
animadversion
of
the
people
the
bill
authorizing
a
subscription
to
the
louisville
and
portland
canal
affords
a
striking
illustration
of
the
difficulty
of
withholding
additional
appropriations
for
the
same
object
when
the
first
erroneous
step
has
been
taken
by
instituting
a
partnership
between
the
government
and
private
companies
it
proposes
a
third
subscription
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
when
each
preceding
one
was
at
the
time
regarded
as
the
extent
of
the
aid
which
government
was
to
render
to
that
work
and
the
accompanying
bill
for
light
houses
etc
contains
an
appropriation
for
a
survey
of
the
bed
of
the
river
with
a
view
to
its
improvement
by
removing
the
obstruction
which
the
canal
is
designed
to
avoid
this
improvement
if
successful
would
afford
a
free
passage
of
the
river
and
render
the
canal
entirely
useless
to
such
improvidence
is
the
course
of
legislation
subject
in
relation
to
internal
improvements
on
local
matters
even
with
the
best
intentions
on
the
part
of
congress
although
the
motives
which
have
influenced
me
in
this
matter
may
be
already
sufficiently
stated
i
am
never
the
less
induced
by
its
importance
to
add
a
few
observations
of
a
general
character
in
my
objections
to
the
bills
authorizing
subscriptions
to
the
maysville
and
rockville
road
companies
i
expressed
my
views
fully
in
regard
to
the
power
of
congress
to
construct
roads
and
canals
within
a
state
of
to
appropriate
money
for
improvements
of
a
local
character
i
at
the
same
time
intimated
me
belief
that
the
right
to
make
appropriations
for
such
as
were
of
a
national
character
had
been
so
generally
acted
upon
and
so
long
acquiesced
in
by
the
federal
and
state
governments
and
the
constituents
of
each
as
to
justify
its
exercise
on
the
ground
of
continued
and
uninterrupted
usage
but
that
it
was
never
the
less
highly
expedient
that
appropriations
even
of
that
character
should
with
the
exception
made
at
the
time
be
deferred
until
the
national
debt
is
paid
and
that
in
the
mean
while
some
general
rule
for
the
action
of
the
government
in
that
respect
ought
to
be
established
these
suggestions
were
not
necessary
to
the
decision
of
the
question
then
before
me
and
were
i
readily
admit
intended
to
awake
the
attention
and
draw
forth
the
opinion
and
observations
of
our
constituents
upon
a
subject
of
the
highest
importance
to
their
interests
and
one
destined
to
exert
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
future
operations
of
our
political
system
i
know
of
no
tribunal
to
which
a
public
man
in
this
country
in
a
case
of
doubt
and
difficulty
can
appeal
with
greater
advantage
or
more
propriety
than
the
judgment
of
the
people
and
although
i
must
necessarily
in
the
discharge
of
my
official
duties
be
governed
by
the
dictates
of
my
own
judgment
i
have
no
desire
to
conceal
my
anxious
wish
to
conform
as
far
as
i
can
to
the
views
of
those
for
whom
i
act
all
irregular
expressions
of
public
opinion
are
of
necessity
attended
with
some
doubt
as
to
their
accuracy
but
making
full
allowances
on
that
account
i
can
not
i
think
deceive
myself
in
believing
that
the
acts
referred
to
as
well
as
the
suggestions
which
i
allowed
myself
to
make
in
relation
to
their
bearing
upon
the
future
operations
of
the
government
have
been
approved
by
the
great
body
of
the
people
that
those
whose
immediate
pecuniary
interests
are
to
be
affected
by
proposed
expenditures
should
shrink
from
the
application
of
a
rule
which
prefers
their
more
general
and
remote
interests
to
those
which
are
personal
and
immediate
is
to
be
expected
but
even
such
objections
must
from
the
nature
of
our
population
be
but
temporary
in
their
duration
and
if
it
were
otherwise
our
course
should
be
the
same
for
the
time
is
yet
i
hope
far
distant
when
those
intrusted
with
power
to
be
exercised
for
the
good
of
the
whole
will
consider
it
either
honest
or
wise
to
purchase
local
favors
at
the
sacrifice
of
principle
and
general
good
so
understanding
public
sentiment
and
thoroughly
satisfied
that
the
best
interests
of
our
common
country
imperiously
require
that
the
course
which
i
have
recommended
in
this
regard
should
be
adopted
i
have
upon
the
most
mature
consideration
determined
to
pursue
it
it
is
due
to
candor
as
well
as
to
my
own
feelings
that
i
should
express
the
reluctance
and
anxiety
which
i
must
at
all
times
experience
in
exercising
the
undoubted
right
of
the
executive
to
withhold
his
assent
from
bills
on
other
grounds
than
their
constitutionality
that
this
right
should
not
be
exercised
on
slight
occasions
all
will
admit
it
is
only
in
matters
of
deep
interest
when
the
principle
involved
may
be
justly
regarded
as
next
in
importance
to
infractions
of
the
constitution
itself
that
such
a
step
can
be
expected
to
meet
with
the
approbation
of
the
people
such
an
occasion
do
i
conscientiously
believe
the
present
to
be
in
the
discharge
of
this
delicate
and
highly
responsible
duty
i
am
sustained
by
the
reflection
that
the
exercise
of
this
power
has
been
deemed
consistent
with
the
obligation
of
official
duty
by
several
of
my
predecessors
and
by
the
persuasion
too
that
what
ever
liberal
institutions
may
have
to
fear
from
the
encroachments
of
executive
power
which
has
been
every
where
the
cause
of
so
much
strife
and
bloody
contention
but
little
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
from
a
precedent
by
which
that
authority
denies
to
itself
the
exercise
of
powers
that
bring
in
their
train
influence
and
patronage
of
great
extent
and
thus
excludes
the
operation
of
personal
interests
every
where
the
bane
of
official
trust
i
derive
too
no
small
degree
of
satisfaction
from
the
reflection
that
if
i
have
mistaken
the
interests
and
wishes
of
the
people
the
constitution
affords
the
means
of
soon
redressing
the
error
by
selecting
for
the
place
their
favor
has
bestowed
upon
me
a
citizen
whose
opinions
may
accord
with
their
own
i
trust
in
the
mean
time
the
interests
of
the
nation
will
be
saved
from
prejudice
by
a
rigid
application
of
that
portion
of
the
public
funds
which
might
otherwise
be
applied
to
different
objects
to
that
highest
of
all
our
obligations
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
and
an
opportunity
be
afforded
for
the
adoption
of
some
better
rule
for
the
operations
of
the
government
in
this
matter
than
any
which
has
hitherto
been
acted
upon
profoundly
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
subject
not
merely
as
relates
to
the
general
prosperity
of
the
country
but
to
the
safety
of
the
federal
system
i
can
not
avoid
repeating
my
earnest
hope
that
all
good
citizens
who
take
a
proper
interest
in
the
success
and
harmony
of
our
admirable
political
institutions
and
who
are
incapable
of
desiring
to
convert
an
opposite
state
of
things
into
means
for
the
gratification
of
personal
ambition
will
laying
aside
minor
considerations
and
discarding
local
prejudices
unite
their
honest
exertions
to
establish
some
fixed
general
principle
which
shall
be
calculated
to
effect
the
greatest
extent
of
public
good
in
regard
to
the
subject
of
internal
improvement
and
afford
the
least
ground
for
sectional
discontent
the
general
grounds
of
my
objection
to
local
appropriations
have
been
heretofore
expressed
and
i
shall
endeavor
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
what
has
been
already
urgedthe
importance
of
sustaining
the
state
sovereignties
as
far
as
is
consistent
with
the
rightful
action
of
the
federal
government
and
of
preserving
the
greatest
attainable
harmony
between
them
i
will
now
only
add
an
expression
of
my
convictiona
conviction
which
every
days
experience
serves
to
confirmthat
the
political
creed
which
inculcates
the
pursuit
of
those
great
objects
as
a
paramount
duty
is
the
true
faith
and
one
to
which
we
are
mainly
indebted
for
the
present
success
of
the
entire
system
and
to
which
we
must
alone
look
for
its
future
stability
that
there
are
diversities
in
the
interests
of
the
different
states
which
compose
this
extensive
confederacy
must
be
admitted
those
diversities
arising
from
situation
climate
population
and
pursuits
are
doubtless
as
it
is
natural
they
should
be
greatly
exaggerated
by
jealousies
and
that
spirit
of
rivalry
so
inseparable
from
neighboring
communities
these
circumstances
make
it
the
duty
of
those
who
are
intrusted
with
the
management
of
its
affairs
to
neutralize
their
effects
as
far
as
practicable
by
making
the
beneficial
operation
of
the
federal
government
as
equal
and
equitable
among
the
several
states
as
can
be
done
consistently
with
the
great
ends
of
its
institution
it
is
only
necessary
to
refer
to
undoubted
facts
to
see
how
far
the
past
acts
of
the
government
upon
the
subject
under
consideration
have
fallen
short
of
this
object
the
expenditures
heretofore
made
for
internal
improvements
amount
to
upward
of
millions
and
have
been
distributed
in
very
unequal
proportions
amongst
the
states
the
estimated
expense
of
works
of
which
surveys
have
been
made
together
with
that
of
others
projected
and
partially
surveyed
amounts
to
more
than
millions
that
such
improvements
on
account
of
particular
circumstances
may
be
more
advantageously
and
beneficially
made
in
some
states
than
in
others
is
doubtless
true
but
that
they
are
of
a
character
which
should
prevent
an
equitable
distribution
of
the
funds
amongst
the
several
states
is
not
to
be
conceded
the
want
of
this
equitable
distribution
can
not
fail
to
prove
a
prolific
source
of
irritation
among
the
states
we
have
it
const
antly
before
our
eyes
that
professions
of
superior
zeal
in
the
cause
of
internal
improvement
and
a
disposition
to
lavish
the
public
funds
upon
objects
of
this
character
are
daily
and
earnestly
put
forth
by
aspirants
to
power
as
constituting
the
highest
claims
to
the
confidence
of
the
people
would
it
be
strange
under
such
circumstances
and
in
times
of
great
excitement
that
grants
of
this
description
should
find
their
motives
in
objects
which
may
not
accord
with
the
public
good
those
who
have
not
had
occasion
to
see
and
regret
the
indication
of
a
sinister
influence
in
these
matters
in
past
times
have
been
more
fortunate
than
myself
in
their
observation
of
the
course
of
public
affairs
if
to
these
evils
be
added
the
combinations
and
angry
contentions
to
which
such
a
course
of
things
gives
rise
with
their
baleful
influences
upon
the
legislation
of
congress
touching
the
leading
and
appropriate
duties
of
the
federal
government
it
was
but
doing
justice
to
the
character
of
our
people
to
expect
the
severe
condemnation
of
the
past
which
the
recent
exhibitions
of
public
sentiment
has
evinced
nothing
short
of
a
radical
change
in
the
action
of
the
government
upon
the
subject
can
in
my
opinion
remedy
the
evil
if
as
it
would
be
natural
to
expect
the
states
which
have
been
least
favored
in
past
appropriations
should
insist
on
being
redressed
in
those
here
after
to
be
made
at
the
expense
of
the
states
which
have
so
largely
and
disproportionately
participated
we
have
as
matters
now
stand
but
little
security
that
the
attempt
would
do
more
than
change
the
inequality
from
one
quarter
to
another
thus
viewing
the
subject
i
have
heretofore
felt
it
my
duty
to
recommend
the
adoption
of
some
plan
for
the
distribution
of
the
surplus
funds
which
may
at
any
time
remain
in
the
treasury
after
the
national
debt
shall
have
been
paid
among
the
states
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
their
representatives
to
be
applied
by
them
to
objects
of
internal
improvement
although
this
plan
has
met
with
favor
in
some
portions
of
the
union
it
has
also
elicited
objections
which
merit
deliberate
consideration
a
brief
notice
of
these
objections
here
will
not
therefore
i
trust
be
regarded
as
out
of
place
they
rest
as
far
as
they
have
come
to
my
knowledge
on
the
following
grounds
first
an
objection
to
the
ration
of
distribution
second
an
apprehension
that
the
existence
of
such
a
regulation
would
produce
improvident
and
oppressive
taxation
to
raise
the
funds
for
distribution
rd
that
the
mode
proposed
would
lead
to
the
construction
of
works
of
a
local
nature
to
the
exclusion
of
such
as
are
general
and
as
would
consequently
be
of
a
more
useful
character
and
last
that
it
would
create
a
discreditable
and
injurious
dependence
on
the
part
of
the
state
governments
upon
the
federal
power
of
those
who
object
to
the
ration
of
representatives
as
the
basis
of
distribution
some
insist
that
the
importations
of
the
respective
states
would
constitute
one
that
would
be
more
equitable
and
others
again
that
the
extent
of
their
respective
territories
would
furnish
a
standard
which
would
be
more
expedient
and
sufficiently
equitable
the
ration
of
representation
presented
itself
to
my
mind
and
it
still
does
as
one
of
obvious
equity
because
of
its
being
the
ratio
of
contribution
whether
the
funds
to
be
distributed
be
derived
from
the
customs
or
from
direct
taxation
it
does
not
follow
however
that
its
adoption
is
indispensable
to
the
establishment
of
the
system
proposed
there
may
be
considerations
appertaining
to
the
subject
which
would
render
a
departure
to
some
extent
from
the
rule
of
contribution
proper
nor
is
it
absolutely
necessary
that
the
basis
of
distribution
be
confined
to
one
ground
it
may
if
in
the
judgment
of
those
whose
right
it
is
to
fix
it
it
be
deemed
politic
and
just
to
give
it
that
character
have
regard
to
several
in
my
first
message
i
stated
it
to
be
my
opinion
that
it
is
not
probably
that
any
adjustment
of
the
tariff
upon
principles
satisfactory
to
the
people
of
the
union
will
until
a
remote
period
if
ever
leave
the
government
without
a
considerable
surplus
in
the
treasury
beyond
what
may
be
required
for
its
current
surplus
i
have
had
no
cause
to
change
that
opinion
but
much
to
confirm
it
should
these
expectations
be
realized
a
suitable
fund
would
thus
be
produced
for
the
plan
under
consideration
to
operate
upon
and
if
there
be
no
such
fund
its
adoption
will
in
my
opinion
work
no
injury
to
any
interest
for
i
can
not
assent
to
the
justness
of
the
apprehension
that
the
establishment
of
the
proposed
system
would
tend
to
the
encouragement
of
improvident
legislation
of
the
character
supposed
what
ever
the
proper
authority
in
the
exercise
of
constitutional
power
shall
at
any
time
here
after
decide
to
be
for
the
general
good
will
in
that
as
in
other
respects
deserve
and
receive
the
acquiescence
and
support
of
the
whole
country
and
we
have
ample
security
that
every
abuse
of
power
in
that
regard
by
agents
of
the
people
will
receive
a
speedy
and
effectual
corrective
at
their
hands
the
views
which
i
take
of
the
future
founded
on
the
obvious
and
increasing
improvement
of
all
classes
of
our
fellow
citizens
in
intelligence
and
in
public
and
private
virtue
leave
me
without
much
apprehension
on
that
head
i
do
not
doubt
that
those
who
come
after
us
will
be
as
much
alive
as
we
are
to
the
obligation
upon
all
the
trustees
of
political
power
to
exempt
those
for
whom
they
act
from
all
unnecessary
burthens
and
as
sensible
of
the
great
truth
that
the
resources
of
the
nation
beyond
those
required
for
immediate
and
necessary
purposes
of
government
can
no
where
be
so
well
deposited
as
in
the
pockets
of
the
people
it
may
some
times
happen
that
the
interests
of
particular
states
would
not
be
deemed
to
coincide
with
the
general
interest
in
relation
to
improvements
within
such
states
but
if
the
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
this
source
is
sufficient
to
require
it
a
discretion
might
be
reserved
to
congress
to
direct
to
such
improvements
of
a
general
character
as
the
states
concerned
might
not
be
disposed
to
unite
in
the
application
of
the
quotas
of
those
states
under
the
restriction
of
confining
to
each
state
the
expenditure
of
its
appropriate
quota
it
may
however
be
assumed
as
a
safe
general
rule
that
such
improvements
as
serve
to
increase
the
prosperity
of
the
respective
states
in
which
they
are
made
by
giving
new
facilities
to
trade
and
thereby
augmenting
the
wealth
and
comfort
of
their
inhabitants
constitute
the
surest
mode
of
conferring
permanent
and
substantial
advantages
upon
the
whole
the
strength
as
well
as
the
true
glory
of
the
confederacy
is
founded
on
the
prosperity
and
power
of
the
several
independent
sovereignties
of
which
it
is
composed
and
the
certainty
with
which
they
can
be
brought
into
successful
active
cooperation
through
the
agency
of
the
federal
government
it
is
more
over
within
the
knowledge
of
such
as
are
at
all
conversant
with
public
affairs
that
schemes
of
internal
improvement
have
from
time
to
time
been
proposed
which
from
their
extent
and
seeming
magnificence
were
readily
regarded
as
of
national
concernment
but
which
upon
fuller
consideration
and
further
experience
would
now
be
rejected
with
great
unanimity
that
the
plan
under
consideration
would
derive
important
advantages
from
its
certainty
and
that
the
moneys
set
apart
for
these
purposes
would
be
more
judiciously
applied
and
economically
expended
under
the
direction
of
the
state
legislatures
in
which
every
part
of
each
state
is
immediately
represented
can
not
i
think
be
doubted
in
the
new
states
particularly
where
a
comparatively
small
population
is
scattered
over
an
extensive
surface
and
the
representation
in
congress
consequently
very
limited
it
is
natural
to
expect
that
the
appropriations
made
by
the
federal
government
would
be
more
likely
to
be
expended
in
the
vicinity
of
those
numbers
through
whose
immediate
agency
they
were
obtained
than
if
the
funds
were
placed
under
the
control
of
the
legislature
in
which
every
county
of
the
state
has
its
own
representative
this
supposition
does
not
necessarily
impugn
the
motives
of
such
congressional
representatives
nor
is
it
so
intended
we
are
all
sensible
of
the
bias
to
which
the
strongest
minds
and
purest
hearts
are
under
such
circumstances
liable
in
respect
to
the
last
objectionits
probable
effect
upon
the
dignity
and
independence
of
state
governmentsit
appears
to
me
only
necessary
to
state
the
case
as
it
is
and
as
it
would
be
if
the
measure
proposed
were
adopted
to
show
that
the
operation
is
most
likely
to
be
the
very
reverse
of
that
which
the
objection
supposes
in
the
one
case
the
state
would
receive
its
quota
of
the
national
revenue
for
domestic
use
upon
a
fixed
principle
as
a
matter
of
right
and
from
a
fund
to
the
creation
of
which
it
had
itself
contributed
its
fair
proportion
surely
there
could
be
nothing
derogatory
in
that
as
matters
now
stand
the
states
themselves
in
their
sovereign
character
are
not
unfrequently
petitioners
at
the
bar
of
the
federal
legislature
for
such
allowances
out
of
the
national
treasury
as
it
may
comport
with
their
pleasure
or
sense
of
duty
to
bestow
upon
them
it
can
not
require
argument
to
prove
which
of
the
two
courses
is
most
compatible
with
the
efficiency
or
respectability
of
the
state
governments
but
all
these
are
matters
for
discussion
and
dispassionate
consideration
that
the
desired
adjustment
would
be
attended
with
difficulty
affords
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
attempted
the
effective
operation
of
such
motives
would
have
prevented
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
under
which
we
have
so
long
lived
and
under
the
benign
influence
of
which
our
beloved
country
has
so
signally
prospered
the
framers
of
that
sacred
instrument
had
greater
difficulties
to
overcome
and
they
did
overcome
them
the
patriotism
of
the
people
directed
by
a
deep
conviction
of
the
importance
of
the
union
produced
mutual
concession
and
reciprocal
forbearance
strict
right
was
merged
in
a
spirit
of
compromise
and
the
result
has
consecrated
their
disinterested
devotion
to

the
general
weal
unless
the
american
people
have
degenerated
the
same
result
can
be
again
effected
when
ever
experience
points
out
the
necessity
of
a
resort
to
the
same
means
to
uphold
the
fabric
which
their
fathers
have
reared
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
make
a
system
of
government
like
ours
or
any
other
operate
with
precise
equality
upon
states
situated
like
those
which
compose
this
confederacy
nor
is
inequality
always
injustice
every
state
can
not
expect
to
shape
the
measures
of
the
general
government
to
suit
its
own
particular
interests
the
causes
which
prevent
it
are
seated
in
the
nature
of
things
and
can
not
be
entirely
counteracted
by
human
means
mutual
forbearance
becomes
therefore
a
duty
obligatory
upon
all
and
we
may
i
am
confident
count
upon
a
cheerful
compliance
with
this
high
injunction
on
the
part
of
our
constituents
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
they
will
object
to
make
such
comparatively
inconsiderable
sacrifices
for
the
preservation
of
rights
and
privileges
which
other
less
favored
portions
of
the
world
have
in
vain
waded
through
seas
of
blood
to
acquire
our
course
is
a
safe
one
if
it
be
but
faithfully
adhered
to
acquiescence
in
the
constitutionally
expressed
will
of
the
majority
and
the
exercise
of
that
will
in
a
spirit
of
moderation
justice
and
brotherly
kindness
will
constitute
a
cement
which
would
for
ever
preserve
our
union
those
who
cherish
and
inculcate
sentiments
like
these
render
a
most
essential
service
to
their
country
while
those
who
seek
to
weaken
their
influence
are
how
ever
conscientious
and
praise
worthy
their
intentions
in
effect
its
worst
enemies
if
the
intelligence
and
influence
of
the
country
instead
of
laboring
to
foment
sectional
prejudices
to
be
made
subservient
to
party
warfare
were
in
good
faith
applied
to
the
eradication
of
causes
of
local
discontent
by
the
improvement
of
our
institutions
and
by
facilitating
their
adaptation
to
the
condition
of
the
times
this
task
would
prove
one
of
less
difficulty
may
we
not
hope
that
the
obvious
interests
of
our
common
country
and
the
dictates
of
an
enlightened
patriotism
will
in
the
end
lead
the
public
mind
in
that
direction
after
all
the
nature
of
the
subject
does
not
admit
of
a
plan
wholly
free
from
objection
that
which
has
for
some
time
been
in
operation
is
perhaps
the
worst
that
could
exist
and
every
advance
that
can
be
made
in
its
improvement
is
a
matter
eminently
worthy
of
your
most
deliberate
attention
it
is
very
possible
that
one
better
calculated
to
effect
the
objects
in
view
may
yet
be
devised
if
so
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
those
who
disapprove
the
past
and
dissent
from
what
is
proposed
for
the
future
will
feel
it
their
duty
to
direct
their
attention
to
it
as
they
must
be
sensible
that
unless
some
fixed
rule
for
the
action
of
the
federal
government
in
this
respect
is
established
the
course
now
attempted
to
be
arrested
will
be
again
resorted
to
any
mode
which
is
calculated
to
give
the
greatest
degree
of
effect
and
harmony
to
our
legislation
upon
the
subject
which
shall
best
serve
to
keep
the
movements
of
the
federal
government
within
the
sphere
intended
by
those
who
modeled
and
those
who
adopted
it
which
shall
lead
to
the
extinguishment
of
the
national
debt
in
the
shortest
period
and
impose
the
lightest
burthens
upon
our
constituents
shall
receive
from
me
a
cordial
and
firm
support
among
the
objects
of
great
national
concern
i
can
not
omit
to
press
again
upon
your
attention
that
part
of
the
constitution
which
regulates
the
election
of
president
and
vicepresident
the
necessity
for
its
amendment
is
made
so
clear
to
my
mind
by
observation
of
its
evils
and
by
the
many
able
discussions
which
they
have
elicited
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
elsewhere
that
i
should
be
wanting
to
my
duty
were
i
to
withhold
another
expression
of
my
deep
solicitude
on
the
subject
our
system
fortunately
contemplates
a
recurrence
to
first
principles
differing
in
this
respect
from
all
that
have
preceded
it
and
securing
it
i
trust
equally
against
the
decay
and
the
commotions
which
have
marked
the
progress
of
other
governments
our
fellow
citizens
too
who
in
proportion
to
their
love
of
liberty
keep
a
steady
eye
upon
the
means
of
sustaining
it
do
not
require
to
be
reminded
of
the
duty
they
owe
to
themselves
to
remedy
all
essential
defects
in
so
vital
a
part
of
their
system
while
they
are
sensible
that
every
evil
attendant
upon
its
operation
is
not
necessarily
indicative
of
a
bad
organization
but
may
proceed
from
temporary
causes
yet
the
habitual
presence
or
even
a
single
instance
of
evils
which
can
be
clearly
traced
to
an
organic
defect
will
not
i
trust
be
overlooked
through
a
too
scrupulous
veneration
for
the
work
of
their
ancestors
the
constitution
was
an
experiment
committed
to
the
virtue
and
intelligence
of
the
great
mass
of
our
countrymen
in
whose
ranks
the
framers
of
it
themselves
were
to
perform
the
part
of
patriotic
observation
and
scrutiny
and
if
they
have
passed
from
the
stage
of
existence
with
an
increased
confidence
in
its
general
adaptation
to
our
condition
we
should
learn
from
authority
so
high
the
duty
of
fortifying
the
points
in
it
which
time
proves
to
be
exposed
rather
than
be
deterred
from
approaching
them
by
the
suggestions
of
fear
or
the
dictates
of
misplaced
reverence
a
provision
which
does
not
secure
to
the
people
a
direct
choice
of
their
chief
magistrate
but
has
a
tendency
to
defeat
their
will
presented
to
my
mind
such
an
inconsistence
with
the
general
spirit
of
our
institutions
that
i
was
indeed
to
suggest
for
your
consideration
the
substitute
which
appeared
to
me
at
the
same
time
the
most
likely
to
correct
the
evil
and
to
meet
the
views
of
our
constituents
the
most
mature
reflection
since
has
added
strength
to
the
belief
that
the
best
interests
of
our
country
require
the
speedy
adoption
of
some
plan
calculated
to
effect
this
end
a
contingency
which
some
times
places
it
in
the
power
of
a
single
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
decide
an
election
of
so
high
and
solemn
a
character
is
unjust
to
the
people
and
becomes
when
it
occurs
a
source
of
embarrassment
to
the
individuals
thus
brought
into
power
and
a
cause
of
distrust
of
the
representative
body
liable
as
the
confederacy
is
from
its
great
extent
to
parties
founded
upon
sectional
interests
and
to
a
corresponding
multiplication
of
candidates
for
the
presidency
the
tendency
of
the
constitutional
reference
to
the
house
of
representatives
is
to
devolve
the
election
upon
that
body
in
almost
every
instance
and
what
ever
choice
may
then
be
made
among
the
candidates
thus
presented
to
them
to
swell
the
influence
of
particular
interests
to
a
degree
inconsistent
with
the
general
good
the
consequences
of
this
feature
of
the
constitution
appear
far
more
threatening
to
the
peace
and
integrity
of
the
union
than
any
which
i
can
conceive
as
likely
to
result
from
the
simple
legislative
action
of
the
federal
government
it
was
a
leading
object
with
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
keep
as
separate
as
possible
the
action
of
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
the
government
to
secure
this
object
nothing
is
more
essential
than
to
preserve
the
former
from
all
temptations
of
private
interest
and
therefore
so
to
direct
the
patronage
of
the
latter
as
not
to
permit
such
temptations
to
be
offered
experience
abundantly
demonstrates
that
every
precaution
in
this
respect
is
a
valuable
safeguard
of
liberty
and
one
which
my
reflections
upon
the
tendencies
of
our
system
incline
me
to
think
should
be
made
still
stronger
it
was
for
this
reason
that
in
connection
with
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
removing
all
intermediate
agency
in
the
choice
of
the
president
i
recommended
some
restrictions
upon
the
reeligibility
of
that
officer
and
upon
the
tenure
of
offices
generally
the
reason
still
exists
and
i
renew
the
recommendation
with
an
increased
confidence
that
its
adoption
will
strengthen
those
checks
by
which
the
constitution
designed
to
secure
the
independence
of
each
department
of
the
government
and
promote
the
healthful
and
equitable
administration
of
all
the
trusts
which
it
has
created
the
agent
most
likely
to
contravene
this
design
of
the
constitution
is
the
chief
magistrate
in
order
particularly
that
his
appointment
may
as
far
as
possible
be
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
any
improper
influences
in
order
that
he
may
approach
the
solemn
responsibilities
of
the
highest
office
in
the
gift
of
a
free
people
uncommitted
to
any
other
course
than
the
strict
line
of
constitutional
duty
and
that
the
securities
for
this
independence
may
be
rendered
as
strong
as
the
nature
of
power
and
the
weakness
of
its
possessor
will
admit
i
can
not
too
earnestly
invite
your
attention
to
the
propriety
of
promoting
such
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
as
will
render
him
ineligible
after
one
term
of
service
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
announce
to
congress
that
the
benevolent
policy
of
the
government
steadily
pursued
for
nearly
years
in
relation
to
the
removal
of
the
indians
beyond
the
white
settlements
is
approaching
to
a
happy
consummation
two
important
tribes
have
accepted
the
provision
made
for
their
removal
at
the
last
session
of
congress
and
it
is
believed
that
their
example
will
induce
the
remaining
tribes
also
to
seek
the
same
obvious
advantages
the
consequences
of
a
speedy
removal
will
be
important
to
the
united
states
to
individual
states
and
to
the
indians
themselves
the
pecuniary
advantages
which
it
promises
to
the
government
are
the
least
of
its
recommendations
it
puts
an
end
to
all
possible
danger
of
collision
between
the
authorities
of
the
general
and
state
governments
on
account
of
the
indians
it
will
place
a
dense
and
civilized
population
in
large
tracts
of
country
now
occupied
by
a
few
savage
hunters
by
opening
the
whole
territory
between
tennessee
on
the
north
and
louisiana
on
the
south
to
the
settlement
of
the
whites
it
will
incalculably
strengthen
the
south
west
frontier
and
render
the
adjacent
states
strong
enough
to
repel
future
invasions
without
remote
aid
it
will
relieve
the
whole
state
of
mississippi

and
the
western
part
of
alabama
of
indian
occupancy
and
enable
those
states
to
advance
rapidly
in
population
wealth
and
power
it
will
separate
the
indians
from
immediate
contact
with
settlements
of
whites
free
them
from
the
power
of
the
states
enable
them
to
pursue
happiness
in
their
own
way
and
under
their
own
rude
institutions
will
retard
the
progress
of
decay
which
is
lessening
their
numbers
and
perhaps
cause
them
gradually
under
the
protection
of
the
government
and
through
the
influence
of
good
counsels
to
cast
off
their
savage
habits
and
become
an
interesting
civilized
and
christian
community
these
consequences
some
of
them
so
certain
and
the
rest
so
probable
make
the
complete
execution
of
the
plan
sanctioned
by
congress
at
their
last
session
an
object
of
much
solicitude
toward
the
aborigines
of
the
country
no
one
can
indulge
a
more
friendly
feeling
than
myself
or
would
go
further
in
attempting
to
reclaim
them
from
their
wandering
habits
and
make
them
a
happy
prosperous
people
i
have
endeavored
to
impress
upon
them
my
own
solemn
convictions
of
the
duties
and
powers
of
the
general
government
in
relation
to
the
state
authorities
for
the
justice
of
the
laws
passed
by
the
states
within
the
scope
of
their
reserved
powers
they
are
not
responsible
to
this
government
as
individuals
we
may
entertain
and
express
our
opinions
of
their
acts
but
as
a
government
we
have
as
little
right
to
control
them
as
we
have
to
prescribe
laws
for
other
nations
with
a
full
understanding
of
the
subject
the
choctaw
and
the
chickasaw
tribes
have
with
great
unanimity
determined
to
avail
themselves
of
the
liberal
offers
presented
by
the
act
of
congress
and
have
agreed
to
remove
beyond
the
mississippi
river
treaties
have
been
made
with
them
which
in
due
season
will
be
submitted
for
consideration
in
negotiating
these
treaties
they
were
made
to
understand
their
true
condition
and
they
have
preferred
maintaining
their
independence
in
the
western
forests
to
submitting
to
the
laws
of
the
states
in
which
they
now
reside
these
treaties
being
probably
the
last
which
will
ever
be
made
with
them
are
characterized
by
great
liberality
on
the
part
of
the
government
they
give
the
indians
a
liberal
sum
in
consideration
of
their
removal
and
comfortable
subsistence
on
their
arrival
at
their
new
homes
if
it
be
their
real
interest
to
maintain
a
separate
existence
they
will
there
be
at
liberty
to
do
so
without
the
inconveniences
and
vexations
to
which
they
would
unavoidably
have
been
subject
in
alabama
and
mississippi
humanity
has
often
wept
over
the
fate
of
the
aborigines
of
this
country
and
philanthropy
has
been
long
busily
employed
in
devising
means
to
avert
it
but
its
progress
has
never
for
a
moment
been
arrested
and
one
by
one
have
many
powerful
tribes
disappeared
from
the
earth
to
follow
to
the
tomb
the
last
of
his
race
and
to
tread
on
the
graves
of
extinct
nations
excite
melancholy
reflections
but
true
philanthropy
reconciles
the
mind
to
these
vicissitudes
as
it
does
to
the
extinction
of
one
generation
to
make
room
for
another
in
the
monuments
and
fortifications
of
an
unknown
people
spread
over
the
extensive
regions
of
the
west
we
behold
the
memorials
of
a
once
powerful
race
which
was
exterminated
of
has
disappeared
to
make
room
for
the
existing
savage
tribes
nor
is
there
any
thing
in
this
which
upon
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
general
interests
of
the
human
race
is
to
be
regretted
philanthropy
could
not
wish
to
see
this
continent
restored
to
the
condition
in
which
it
was
found
by
our
forefathers
what
good
man
would
prefer
a
country
covered
with
forests
and
ranged
by
a
few
thousand
savages
to
our
extensive
republic
studded
with
cities
towns
and
prosperous
farms
embellished
with
all
the
improvements
which
art
can
devise
or
industry
execute
occupied
by
more
than
happy
people
and
filled
with
all
the
blessings
of
liberty
civilization
and
religion
the
present
policy
of
the
government
is
but
a
continuation
of
the
same
progressive
change
by
a
milder
process
the
tribes
which
occupied
the
countries
now
constituting
the
eastern
states
were
annihilated
or
have
melted
away
to
make
room
for
the
whites
the
waves
of
population
and
civilization
are
rolling
to
the
westward
and
we
now
propose
to
acquire
the
countries
occupied
by
the
red
men
of
the
south
and
west
by
a
fair
exchange
and
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states
to
send
them
to
a
land
where
their
existence
may
be
prolonged
and
perhaps
made
perpetual
doubtless
it
will
be
painful
to
leave
the
graves
of
their
fathers
but
what
do
they
more
than
our
ancestors
did
or
than
our
children
are
now
doing
to
better
their
condition
in
an
unknown
land
our
forefathers
left
all
that
was
dear
in
earthly
objects
our
children
by
thousands
yearly
leave
the
land
of
their
birth
to
seek
new
homes
in
distant
regions
does
humanity
weep
at
these
painful
separations
from
every
thing
animate
and
inanimate
with
which
the
young
heart
has
become
entwined
far
from
it
it
is
rather
a
source
of
joy
that
our
country
affords
scope
where
our
young
population
may
range
unconstrained
in
body
or
in
mind
developing
the
power
and
faculties
of
man
in
their
highest
perfection
these
remove
hundreds
and
almost
thousands
of
miles
at
their
own
expense
purchase
the
lands
they
occupy
and
support
themselves
at
their
new
homes
from
the
moment
of
their
arrival
can
it
be
cruel
in
this
government
when
by
events
which
it
can
not
control
the
indian
is
made
discontented
in
his
ancient
home
to
purchase
his
lands
to
give
him
a
new
and
extensive
territory
to
pay
the
expense
of
his
removal
and
support
him
a
year
in
his
new
abode
how
many
thousands
of
our
own
people
would
gladly
embrace
the
opportunity
of
removing
to
the
west
on
such
conditions
if
the
offers
made
to
the
indians
were
extended
to
them
they
would
be
hailed
with
gratitude
and
joy
and
is
it
supposed
that
the
wandering
savage
has
a
stronger
attachment
to
his
home
than
the
settled
civilized
christian
is
it
more
afflicting
to
him
to
leave
the
graves
of
his
fathers
than
it
is
to
our
brothers
and
children
rightly
considered
the
policy
of
the
general
government
toward
the
red
man
is
not
only
liberal
but
generous
he
is
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
laws
of
the
states
and
mingle
with
their
population
to
save
him
from
this
alternative
or
perhaps
utter
annihilation
the
general
government
kindly
offers
him
a
new
home
and
proposes
to
pay
the
whole
expense
of
his
removal
and
settlement
in
the
consummation
of
a
policy
originating
at
an
early
period
and
steadily
pursued
by
every
administration
within
the
present
centuryso
just
to
the
states
and
so
generous
to
the
indiansthe
executive
feels
it
has
a
right
to
expect
the
cooperation
of
congress
and
of
all
good
and
disinterested
men
the
states
moreover
have
a
right
to
demand
it
it
was
substantially
a
part
of
the
compact
which
made
them
members
of
our
confederacy
with
georgia
there
is
an
express
contract
with
the
new
states
an
implied
one
of
equal
obligation
why
in
authorizing
ohio
indiana
illinois
missouri
mississippi
and
alabama
to
form
constitutions
and
become
separate
states
did
congress
include
within
their
limits
extensive
tracts
of
indian
lands
and
in
some
instances
powerful
indian
tribes
was
it
not
understood
by
both
parties
that
the
power
of
the
states
was
to
be
coextensive
with
their
limits
and
that
with
all
convenient
dispatch
the
general
government
should
extinguish
the
indian
title
and
remove
every
obstruction
to
the
complete
jurisdiction
of
the
state
governments
over
the
soil
probably
not
one
of
those
states
would
have
accepted
a
separate
existencecertainly
it
would
never
have
been
granted
by
congresshad
it
been
understood
that
they
were
to
be
confined
for
ever
to
those
small
portions
of
their
nominal
territory
the
indian
title
to
which
had
at
the
time
been
extinguished
it
is
therefore
a
duty
which
this
government
owes
to
the
new
states
to
extinguish
as
soon
as
possible
the
indian
title
to
all
lands
which
congress
themselves
have
included
within
their
limits
when
this
is
done
the
duties
of
the
general
government
in
relation
to
the
states
and
the
indians
within
their
limits
are
at
an
end
the
indians
may
leave
the
state
or
not
as
they
choose
the
purchase
of
their
lands
does
not
alter
in
the
least
their
personal
relations
with
the
state
government
no
act
of
the
general
government
has
ever
been
deemed
necessary
to
give
the
states
jurisdiction
over
the
persons
of
the
indians
that
they
possess
by
virtue
of
their
sovereign
power
within
their
own
limits
in
as
full
a
manner
before
as
after
the
purchase
of
the
indian
lands
nor
can
this
government
add
to
or
diminish
it
may
we
not
hope
therefore
that
all
good
citizens
and
none
more
zealously
than
those
who
think
the
indians
oppressed
by
subjection
to
the
laws
of
the
states
will
unite
in
attempting
to
open
the
eyes
of
those
children
of
the
forest
to
their
true
condition
and
by
a
speedy
removal
to
relieve
them
from
all
the
evils
real
or
imaginary
present
or
prospective
with
which
they
may
be
supposed
to
be
threatened
among
the
numerous
causes
of
congratulation
the
condition
of
our
impost
revenue
deserves
special
mention
in
as
much
as
it
promises
the
means
of
extinguishing
the
public
debt
sooner
than
was
anticipated
and
furnishes
a
strong
illustration
of
the
practical
effects
of
the
present
tariff
upon
our
commercial
interests
the
object
of
the
tariff
is
objected
to
by
some
as
unconstitutional
and
it
is
considered
by
almost
all
as
defective
in
many
of
its
parts
the
power
to
impose
duties
on
imports
originally
belonged
to
the
several
states
the
right
to
adjust
those
duties
with
a
view
to
the
encouragement
of
domestic
branches
of
industry
is
so
completely
incidental
to
that
power
that
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
the
existence
of
the
one
without
the
other
the
states
have
delegated
their
whole
authority
over
imports
to
the
general
government
without
limitation
or
restriction
saving
the
very
inconsiderable
reservation
relating
to
their
inspection
laws
this
authority
having
thus
entirely
passed
from
the
states
the
right
to
exercise
it
for
t
he
purpose
of
protection
does
not
exist
in
them
and
consequently
if
it
be
not
possessed
by
the
general
government
it
must
be
extinct
our
political
system
would
thus
present
the
anomaly
of
a
people
stripped
of
the
right
to
foster
their
own
industry
and
to
counteract
the
most
selfish
and
destructive
policy
which
might
be
adopted
by
foreign
nations
this
sure
can
not
be
the
case
this
indispensable
power
thus
surrendered
by
the
states
must
be
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
on
the
subject
expressly
delegated
to
congress
in
this
conclusion
i
am
confirmed
as
well
by
the
opinions
of
presidents
washington
jefferson
madison
and
monroe
who
have
each
repeatedly
recommended
the
exercise
of
this
right
under
the
constitution
as
by
the
uniform
practice
of
congress
the
continued
acquiescence
of
the
states
and
the
general
understanding
of
the
people
the
difficulties
of
a
more
expedient
adjustment
of
the
present
tariff
although
great
are
far
from
being
insurmountable
some
are
unwilling
to
improve
any
of
its
parts
because
they
would
destroy
the
whole
others
fear
to
touch
the
objectionable
parts
lest
those
they
approve
should
be
jeoparded
i
am
persuaded
that
the
advocates
of
these
conflicting
views
do
injustice
to
the
american
people
and
to
their
representatives
the
general
interest
is
the
interest
of
each
and
my
confidence
is
entire
that
to
insure
the
adoption
of
such
modifications
of
the
tariff
as
the
general
interest
requires
it
is
only
necessary
that
that
interest
should
be
understood
it
is
an
infirmity
of
our
nature
to
mingle
our
interests
and
prejudices
with
the
operation
of
our
reasoning
powers
and
attribute
to
the
objects
of
our
likes
and
dislikes
qualities
they
do
not
possess
and
effects
they
can
not
produce
the
effects
of
the
present
tariff
are
doubtless
overrated
both
in
its
evils
and
in
its
advantages
by
one
class
of
reasoners
the
reduced
price
of
cotton
and
other
agricultural
products
is
ascribed
wholly
to
its
influence
and
by
another
the
reduced
price
of
manufactured
articles
the
probability
is
that
neither
opinion
approaches
the
truth
and
that
both
are
induced
by
that
influence
of
interests
and
prejudices
to
which
i
have
referred
the
decrease
of
prices
extends
throughout
the
commercial
world
embracing
not
only
the
raw
material
and
the
manufactured
article
but
provisions
and
lands
the
cause
must
therefore
be
deeper
and
more
pervading
than
the
tariff
of
the
united
states
it
may
in
a
measure
be
attributable
to
the
increased
value
of
the
precious
metals
produced
by
a
diminution
of
the
supply
and
an
increase
in
the
demand
while
commerce
has
rapidly
extended
itself
and
population
has
augmented
the
supply
of
gold
and
silver
the
general
medium
of
exchange
has
been
greatly
interrupted
by
civil
convulsions
in
the
countries
from
which
they
are
principally
drawn
a
part
of
the
effect
too
is
doubtless
owing
to
an
increase
of
operatives
and
improvements
in
machinery
but
on
the
whole
it
is
questionable
whether
the
reduction
in
the
price
of
lands
produce
and
manufactures
has
been
greater
than
the
appreciation
of
the
standard
of
value
while
the
chief
object
of
duties
should
be
revenue
they
may
be
so
adjusted
as
to
encourage
manufactures
in
this
adjustment
however
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
to
be
guided
by
the
general
good
objects
of
national
importance
alone
ought
to
be
protected
of
these
the
productions
of
our
soil
our
mines
and
our
work
shops
essential
to
national
defense
occupy
the
first
rank
what
ever
other
species
of
domestic
industry
having
the
importance
to
which
i
have
referred
may
be
expected
after
temporary
protection
to
compete
with
foreign
labor
on
equal
terms
merit
the
same
attention
in
a
subordinate
degree
the
present
tariff
taxes
some
of
the
comforts
of
life
unnecessarily
high
it
undertakes
to
protect
interests
too
local
and
minute
to
justify
a
general
exaction
and
it
also
attempts
to
force
some
kinds
of
manufactures
for
which
the
country
is
not
ripe
much
relief
will
be
derived
in
some
of
these
respects
from
the
measures
of
your
last
session
the
best
as
well
as
fairest
mode
of
determining
whether
from
any
just
considerations
a
particular
interest
ought
to
receive
protection
would
be
to
submit
the
question
singly
for
deliberation
if
after
due
examination
of
its
merits
unconnected
with
extraneous
considerationssuch
as
a
desire
to
sustain
a
general
system
or
to
purchase
support
for
a
different
interestit
should
enlist
in
its
favor
a
majority
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
there
can
be
little
danger
of
wrong
or
injury
in
adjusting
the
tariff
with
reference
to
its
protective
effect
if
this
obviously
just
principle
were
honestly
adhered
to
the
branches
of
industry
which
deserve
protection
would
be
saved
from
the
prejudice
excited
against
them
when
that
protection
forms
part
of
a
system
by
which
portions
of
the
country
feel
or
conceive
themselves
to
be
oppressed
what
is
incalculably
more
important
the
vital
principle
of
our
systemthat
principle
which
requires
acquiescence
in
the
will
of
the
majoritywould
be
secure
from
the
discredit
and
danger
to
which
it
is
exposed
by
the
acts
of
majorities
founded
not
on
identity
of
conviction
but
on
combinations
of
small
minorities
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
mutual
assistance
in
measures
which
resting
solely
on
their
own
merits
could
never
be
carried
i
am
well
aware
that
this
is
a
subject
of
so
much
delicacy
on
account
of
the
extended
interests
in
involves
as
to
require
that
it
should
be
touched
with
the
utmost
caution
and
that
while
an
abandonment
of
the
policy
in
which
it
originateda
policy
coeval
with
our
government
and
pursued
through
successive
administrationsis
neither
to
be
expected
or
desired
the
people
have
a
right
to
demand
and
have
demanded
that
it
be
so
modified
as
to
correct
abuses
and
obviate
injustice
that
our
deliberations
on
this
interesting
subject
should
be
uninfluenced
by
those
partisan
conflicts
that
are
incident
to
free
institutions
is
the
fervent
wish
of
my
heart
to
make
this
great
question
which
unhappily
so
much
divides
and
excites
the
public
mind
subservient
to
the
shortsighted
views
of
faction
must
destroy
all
hope
of
settling
it
satisfactorily
to
the
great
body
of
the
people
and
for
the
general
interest
i
can
not
therefore
in
taking
leave
of
the
subject
too
earnestly
for
my
own
feelings
or
the
common
good
warn
you
against
the
blighting
consequences
of
such
a
course
according
to
the
estimates
at
the
treasury
department
the
receipts
in
the
treasury
during
the
present
year
will
amount
to
which
will
exceed
by
about
the
estimate
presented
in
the
last
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
total
expenditure
during
the
year
exclusive
of
public
debt
is
estimated
at
and
the
payment
on
account
of
public
debt
for
the
same
period
will
have
been
leaving
a
balance
in
the
treasury
on
january
st
of
in
connection
with
the
condition
of
our
finances
it
affords
me
pleasure
to
remark
that
judicious
and
efficient
arrangements
have
been
made
by
the
treasury
department
for
securing
the
pecuniary
responsibility
of
the
public
officers
and
the
more
punctual
payment
of
the
public
dues
the
revenue
cutter
service
has
been
organized
and
placed
on
a
good
footing
and
aided
by
an
increase
of
inspectors
at
exposed
points
and
regulations
adopted
under
the
act
of
may
for
the
inspection
and
appraisement
of
merchandise
has
produced
much
improvement
in
the
execution
of
the
laws
and
more
security
against
the
commission
of
frauds
upon
the
revenue
abuses
in
the
allowances
for
fishing
bounties
have
also
been
corrected
and
a
material
saving
in
that
branch
of
the
service
thereby
effected
in
addition
to
these
improvements
the
system
of
expenditure
for
sick
sea
men
belonging
to
the
merchant
service
has
been
revised
and
being
rendered
uniform
and
economical
the
benefits
of
the
fund
applicable
to
this
object
have
been
usefully
extended
the
prosperity
of
our
country
is
also
further
evinced
by
the
increased
revenue
arising
from
the
sale
of
public
lands
as
will
appear
from
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
and
the
documents
accompanying
it
which
are
herewith
transmitted
i
beg
leave
to
draw
your
attention
to
this
report
and
to
the
propriety
of
making
early
appropriations
for
the
objects
which
it
specifies
your
attention
is
again
invited
to
the
subjects
connected
with
that
portion
of
the
public
interests
intrusted
to
the
war
department
some
of
them
were
referred
to
in
my
former
message
and
they
are
presented
in
detail
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
herewith
submitted
i
refer
you
also
to
the
report
of
that
officer
for
a
knowledge
of
the
state
of
the
army
fortifications
arsenals
and
indian
affairs
all
of
which
it
will
be
perceived
have
been
guarded
with
zealous
attention
and
care
it
is
worthy
of
your
consideration
whether
the
armaments
necessary
for
the
fortifications
on
our
maritime
frontier
which
are
now
or
shortly
will
be
completed
should
not
be
in
readiness
sooner
than
the
customary
appropriations
will
enable
the
department
to
provide
them
this
precaution
seems
to
be
due
to
the
general
system
of
fortification
which
has
been
sanctioned
by
congress
and
is
recommended
by
that
maxim
of
wisdom
which
tells
us
in
peace
to
prepare
for
war
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
a
highly
satisfactory
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
concerns
of
that
department
have
been
conducted
during
the
present
year
our
position
in
relation
to
the
most
powerful
nations
of
the
earth
and
the
present
condition
of
europe
admonish
us
to
cherish
this
arm
of
our
national
defense
with
peculiar
care
separated
by
wide
seas
from
all
those
governments
whose
power
we
might
have
reason
to
dread
we
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
attempts
at
conquest
it
is
chiefly
attacks
upon
our
commerce
and
harrassing
inroads
upon
our
coast
against
which
we
have
to
guard
a
naval
force
adequate
to
the
protection
of
our
commerce
always
afloat
with
an
accumulation
of
the
means
to
give
it
a
rapid
extension
in
case
of
need
furnishes
the
power
by
which
all
such
aggressions
may
be
prevent
ed
or
repelled
the
attention
of
the
government
has
therefore
been
recently
directed
more
to
preserving
the
public
vessels
already
built
and
providing
materials
to
be
placed
in
depot
for
future
use
than
to
increasing
their
number
with
the
aid
of
congress
in
a
few
years
the
government
will
be
prepared
in
case
of
emergency
to
put
afloat
a
powerful
navy
of
new
ships
almost
as
soon
as
old
ones
could
be
repaired
the
modifications
in
this
part
of
the
service
suggested
in
my
last
annual
message
which
are
noticed
more
in
detail
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
are
again
recommended
to
your
serious
attention
the
report
of
the
post
master
general
in
like
manner
exhibits
a
satisfactory
view
of
the
important
branch
of
the
government
under
his
charge
in
addition
to
the
benefits
already
secured
by
the
operations
of
the
post
office
department
considerable
improvements
within
the
present
year
have
been
made
by
an
increase
in
the
accommodation
afforded
by
stage
coaches
and
in
the
frequency
and
celerity
of
the
mail
between
some
of
the
most
important
points
of
the
union
under
the
late
contracts
improvements
have
been
provided
for
the
southern
section
of
the
country
and
at
the
same
time
an
annual
saving
made
of
upward
of
not
with
standing
the
excess
of
expenditure
beyond
the
current
receipts
for
a
few
years
past
necessarily
incurred
in
the
fulfillment
of
existing
contracts
and
in
the
additional
expenses
between
the
periods
of
contracting
to
meet
the
demands
created
by
the
rapid
growth
and
extension
of
our
flourishing
country
yet
the
satisfactory
assurance
is
given
that
the
future
revenue
of
the
department
will
be
sufficient
to
meets
its
extensive
engagements
the
system
recently
introduced
that
subjects
its
receipts
and
disbursements
to
strict
regulation
has
entirely
fulfilled
its
designs
it
gives
full
assurance
of
the
punctual
transmission
as
well
as
the
security
of
the
funds
of
the
department
the
efficiency
and
industry
of
its
officers
and
the
ability
and
energy
of
contractors
justify
an
increased
confidence
in
its
continued
prosperity
the
attention
of
congress
was
called
on
a
former
occasion
to
the
necessity
of
such
a
modification
in
the
office
of
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
as
would
render
it
more
adequate
to
the
wants
of
the
public
service
this
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
the
office
of
solicitor
of
the
treasury
and
the
earliest
measures
were
taken
to
give
effect
to
the
provisions
of
the
law
which
authorized
the
appointment
of
that
officer
and
defined
his
duties
but
it
is
not
believed
that
this
provision
however
useful
in
itself
is
calculated
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
extending
the
duties
and
powers
of
the
attorney
generals
office
on
the
contrary
i
am
convinced
that
the
public
interest
would
be
greatly
promoted
by
giving
to
that
officer
the
general
superintendence
of
the
various
law
agents
of
the
government
and
of
all
law
proceedings
whether
civil
or
criminal
in
which
the
united
states
may
be
interested
allowing
him
at
the
same
time
such
compensation
as
would
enable
him
to
devote
his
undivided
attention
to
the
public
business
i
think
such
a
provision
is
alike
due
to
the
public
and
to
the
officer
occasions
of
reference
from
the
different
executive
departments
to
the
attorney
general
are
of
frequent
occurrence
and
the
prompt
decision
of
the
questions
so
referred
tends
much
to
facilitate
the
dispatch
of
business
in
those
departments
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
hereto
appended
shows
also
a
branch
of
the
public
service
not
specifically
intrusted
to
any
officer
which
might
be
advantageously
committed
to
the
attorney
general
but
independently
of
those
considerations
this
office
is
now
one
of
daily
duty
it
was
originally
organized
and
its
compensation
fixed
with
a
view
to
occasional
service
leaving
to
the
incumbent
time
for
the
exercise
of
his
profession
in
private
practice
the
state
of
things
which
warranted
such
an
organization
no
longer
exists
the
frequent
claims
upon
the
services
of
this
officer
would
render
his
absence
from
the
seat
of
government
in
professional
attendance
upon
the
courts
injurious
to
the
public
service
and
the
interests
of
the
government
could
not
fail
to
be
promoted
by
charging
him
with
the
general
superintendence
of
all
its
legal
concerns
under
a
strong
conviction
of
the
justness
of
these
suggestions
i
recommend
it
to
congress
to
make
the
necessary
provisions
for
giving
effect
to
them
and
to
place
the
attorney
general
in
regard
to
compensation
on
the
same
footing
with
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
to
this
officer
might
also
be
intrusted
a
cognizance
of
the
cases
of
insolvency
in
public
debtors
especially
if
the
views
which
i
submitted
on
this
subject
last
year
should
meet
the
approbation
of
congressto
which
i
again
solicit
your
attention
your
attention
is
respectfully
invited
to
the
situation
of
the
district
of
columbia
placed
by
the
constitution
under
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
of
congress
this
district
is
certainly
entitled
to
a
much
greater
share
of
its
consideration
than
it
has
yet
received
there
is
a
want
of
uniformity
in
its
laws
particularly
in
those
of
a
penal
character
which
increases
the
expense
of
their
administration
and
subjects
the
people
to
all
the
inconveniences
which
result
from
the
operation
of
different
codes
in
so
small
a
territory
on
different
sides
of
the
potomac
the
same
offense
is
punishable
in
unequal
degrees
and
the
peculiarities
of
many
of
the
early
laws
of
maryland
and
virginia
remain
in
force
not
with
standing
their
repugnance
in
some
cases
to
the
improvements
which
have
superseded
them
in
those
states
besides
a
remedy
for
these
evils
which
is
loudly
called
for
it
is
respectfully
submitted
whether
a
provision
authorizing
the
election
of
a
delegate
to
represent
the
wants
of
the
citizens
of
this
district
on
the
floor
of
congress
is
not
due
to
them
and
to
the
character
of
our
government
no
principles
of
freedom
and
there
is
none
more
important
than
that
which
cultivates
a
proper
relation
between
the
governors
and
the
governed
imperfect
as
this
must
be
in
this
case
yet
it
is
believed
that
it
would
be
greatly
improved
by
a
representation
in
congress
with
the
same
privileges
that
are
allowed
to
the
other
territories
of
the
united
states
the
penitentiary
is
ready
for
the
reception
of
convicts
and
only
awaits
the
necessary
legislation
to
put
it
into
operation
as
one
object
of
which
i
beg
leave
to
recall
your
attention
to
the
propriety
of
providing
suitable
compensation
for
the
officers
charged
with
its
inspection
the
importance
of
the
principles
involved
in
the
inquiry
whether
it
will
be
proper
to
recharter
the
bank
of
the
united
states
requires
that
i
should
again
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
nothing
has
occurred
to
lessen
in
any
degree
the
dangers
which
many
of
our
citizens
apprehend
from
that
institution
as
at
present
organized
in
the
spirit
of
improvement
and
compromise
which
distinguishes
our
country
and
its
institutions
it
becomes
us
to
inquire
whether
it
be
not
possible
to
secure
the
advantages
afforded
by
the
present
bank
through
the
agency
of
a
bank
of
the
united
states
so
modified
in
its
principles
and
structures
as
to
obviate
constitutional
and
other
objections
it
is
thought
practicable
to
organize
such
a
bank
with
the
necessary
officers
as
a
branch
of
the
treasury
department
based
on
the
public
and
individual
deposits
without
power
to
make
loans
or
purchase
property
which
shall
remit
the
funds
of
the
government
and
the
expense
of
which
may
be
paid
if
thought
advisable
by
allowing
its
officers
to
sell
bills
of
exchange
to
private
individuals
at
a
moderate
premium
not
being
a
corporate
body
having
no
stock
holders
debtors
or
property
and
but
few
officers
it
would
not
be
obnoxious
to
the
constitutional
objections
which
are
urged
against
the
present
bank
and
having
no
means
to
operate
on
the
hopes
fears
or
interests
of
large
masses
of
the
community
it
would
be
shorn
of
the
influence
which
makes
that
bank
formidable
the
states
would
be
strengthened
by
having
in
their
hands
the
means
of
furnishing
the
local
paper
currency
through
their
own
banks
while
the
bank
of
the
united
states
though
issuing
no
paper
would
check
the
issues
of
the
state
banks
by
taking
their
notes
in
deposit
and
for
exchange
only
so
long
as
they
continue
to
be
redeemed
with
specie
in
times
of
public
emergency
the
capacities
of
such
an
institution
might
be
enlarged
by
legislative
provisions
these
suggestions
are
made
not
so
much
as
a
recommendation
as
with
a
view
of
calling
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
possible
modifications
of
a
system
which
can
not
continue
to
exist
in
its
present
form
without
occasional
collisions
with
the
local
authorities
and
perpetual
apprehensions
and
discontent
on
the
part
of
the
states
and
the
people
in
conclusion
fellow
citizens
allow
me
to
invoke
in
behalf
of
your
deliberations
that
spirit
of
conciliation
and
disinterestedness
which
is
the
gift
of
patriotism
under
an
overruling
and
merciful
providence
the
agency
of
this
spirit
has
thus
far
been
signalized
in
the
prosperity
and
glory
of
our
beloved
country
may
its
influence
be
eternal

fellow
citizens
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
it
affords
me
pleasure
to
tender
my
friendly
greetings
to
you
on
the
occasion
of
your
assembling
at
the
seat
of
government
to
enter
upon
the
important
duties
to
which
you
have
been
called
by
the
voice
of
our
countrymen
the
task
devolves
on
me
under
a
provision
of
the
constitution
to
present
to
you
as
the
federal
legislature
of
sovereign
states
and
happy
people
a
view
of
our
affairs
and
to
propose
such
measures
as
in
the
discharge
of
my
official
functions
have
suggested
themselves
as
necessary
to
promote
the
objects
of
our
union
in
communicating
with
you
for
the
first
time
it
is
to
me
a
source
of
unfeigned
satisfaction
calling
for
mutual
gratulation
and
devout
thanks
to
a
benign
providence
that
we
are
at
peace
with
all
mankind
and
that
our
country
exhibits
the
most
cheering
evidence
of
general
welfare
and
progressive
improvement
turning
our
eyes
to
other
nations
our
great
desire
is
to
see
our
brethren
of
the
human
race
secured
in
the
blessings
enjoyed
by
ourselves
and
advancing
in
knowledge
in
freedom
and
in
social
happiness
our
foreign
relations
although
in
their
general
character
pacific
and
friendly
present
subjects
of
difference
between
us
and
other
powers
of
deep
interest
as
well
to
the
country
at
large
as
to
many
of
our
citizens
to
effect
an
adjustment
of
these
shall
continue
to
be
the
object
of
my
earnest
endeavors
and
not
with
standing
the
difficulties
of
the
task
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
apprehend
unfavorable
results
blessed
as
our
country
is
with
every
thing
which
constitutes
national
strength
she
is
fully
adequate
to
the
maintenance
of
all
her
interests
in
discharging
the
responsible
trust
confided
to
the
executive
in
this
respect
it
is
my
settled
purpose
to
ask
nothing
that
is
not
clearly
right
and
to
submit
to
nothing
that
is
wrong
and
i
flatter
myself
that
supported
by
the
other
branches
of
the
government
and
by
the
intelligence
and
patriotism
of
the
people
we
shall
be
able
under
the
protection
of
providence
to
cause
all
our
just
rights
to
be
respected
of
the
unsettled
matters
between
the
united
states
and
other
powers
the
most
prominent
are
those
which
have
for
years
been
the
subject
of
negotiation
with
england
france
and
spain
the
late
periods
at
which
our
ministers
to
those
governments
left
the
united
states
render
it
impossible
at
this
early
day
to
inform
you
of
what
has
been
done
on
the
subjects
with
which
they
have
been
respectively
charged
relying
upon
the
justice
of
our
views
in
relation
to
the
points
committed
to
negotiation
and
the
reciprocal
good
feeling
which
characterizes
our
intercourse
with
those
nations
we
have
the
best
reason
to
hope
for
a
satisfactory
adjustment
of
existing
differences
with
great
britain
alike
distinguished
in
peace
and
war
we
may
look
forward
to
years
of
peaceful
honorable
and
elevated
competition
every
thing
in
the
condition
and
history
of
the
two
nations
is
calculated
to
inspire
sentiments
of
mutual
respect
and
to
carry
conviction
to
the
minds
of
both
that
it
is
their
policy
to
preserve
the
most
cordial
relations
such
are
my
own
views
and
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
such
are
also
the
prevailing
sentiments
of
our
constituents
although
neither
time
nor
opportunity
has
been
afforded
for
a
full
development
of
the
policy
which
the
present
cabinet
of
great
britain
designs
to
pursue
toward
this
country
i
indulge
the
hope
that
it
will
be
of
a
just
and
pacific
character
and
if
this
anticipation
be
realized
we
may
look
with
confidence
to
a
speedy
and
acceptable
adjustment
of
our
affairs
under
the
convention
for
regulating
the
reference
to
arbitration
of
the
disputed
points
of
boundary
under
the
th
article
of
the
treaty
of
ghent
the
proceedings
have
hitherto
been
conducted
in
that
spirit
of
candor
and
liberality
which
ought
ever
to
characterize
the
acts
of
sovereign
states
seeking
to
adjust
by
the
most
unexceptionable
means
important
and
delicate
subjects
of
contention
the
first
sentiments
of
the
parties
have
been
exchanged
and
the
final
replication
on
our
part
is
in
a
course
of
preparation
this
subject
has
received
the
attention
demanded
by
its
great
and
peculiar
importance
to
a
patriotic
member
of
this
confederacy
the
exposition
of
our
rights
already
made
is
such
as
from
the
high
reputation
of
the
commissioners
by
whom
it
has
been
prepared
we
had
a
right
to
expect
our
interests
at
the
court
of
the
sovereign
who
has
evinced
his
friendly
disposition
by
assuming
the
delicate
task
of
arbitration
have
been
committed
to
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
maine
whose
character
talents
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
subject
eminently
qualify
him
for
so
responsible
a
trust
with
full
confidence
in
the
justice
of
our
cause
and
in
the
probity
intelligence
and
uncompromising
independence
of
the
illustrious
arbitrator
we
can
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
the
result
from
france
our
ancient
ally
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
justice
which
becomes
the
sovereign
of
a
powerful
intelligent
and
magnanimous
people
the
beneficial
effects
produced
by
the
commercial
convention
of
limited
as
are
its
provisions
are
too
obvious
not
to
make
a
salutary
impression
upon
the
minds
of
those
who
are
charged
with
the
administration
of
her
government
should
this
result
induce
a
disposition
to
embrace
to
their
full
extent
the
wholesome
principles
which
constitute
our
commercial
policy
our
minister
to
that
court
will
be
found
instructed
to
cherish
such
a
disposition
and
to
aid
in
conducting
it
to
useful
practical
conclusions
the
claims
of
our
citizens
for
depredations
upon
their
property
long
since
committed
under
the
authority
and
in
many
instances
by
the
express
direction
of
the
then
existing
government
of
france
remain
unsatisfied
and
must
therefore
continue
to
furnish
a
subject
of
unpleasant
discussion
and
possible
collision
between
the
two
governments
i
cherish
however
a
lively
hope
founded
as
well
on
the
validity
of
those
claims
and
the
established
policy
of
all
enlightened
governments
as
on
the
known
integrity
of
the
french
monarch
that
the
injurious
delays
of
the
past
will
find
redress
in
the
equity
of
the
future
our
minister
has
been
instructed
to
press
these
demands
on
the
french
government
with
all
the
earnestness
which
is
called
for
by
their
importance
and
irrefutable
justice
and
in
a
spirit
that
will
evince
the
respect
which
is
due
to
the
feelings
of
those
from
whom
the
satisfaction
is
required
our
minister
recently
appointed
to
spain
has
been
authorized
to
assist
in
removing
evils
alike
injurious
to
both
countries
either
by
concluding
a
commercial
convention
upon
liberal
and
reciprocal
terms
or
by
urging
the
acceptance
in
their
full
extent
of
the
mutually
beneficial
provisions
of
our
navigation
acts
he
has
also
been
instructed
to
make
a
further
appeal
to
the
justice
of
spain
in
behalf
of
our
citizens
for
indemnity
for
spoliations
upon
our
commerce
committed
under
her
authorityan
appeal
which
the
pacific
and
liberal
course
observed
on
our
part
and
a
due
confidence
in
the
honor
of
that
government
authorize
us
to
expect
will
not
be
made
in
vain
with
other
european
powers
our
intercourse
is
on
the
most
friendly
footing
in
russia
placed
by
her
territorial
limits
extensive
population
and
great
power
high
in
the
rank
of
nations
the
united
states
have
always
found
a
steadfast
friend
although
her
recent
invasion
of
turkey
awakened
a
lively
sympathy
for
those
who
were
exposed
to
the
desolation
of
war
we
can
not
but
anticipate
that
the
result
will
prove
favorable
to
the
cause
of
civilization
and
to
the
progress
of
human
happiness
the
treaty
of
peace
between
these
powers
having
been
ratified
we
can
not
be
insensible
to
the
great
benefit
to
be
derived
by
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
from
unlocking
the
navigation
of
the
black
sea
a
free
passage
into
which
is
secured
to
all
merchant
vessels
bound
to
ports
of
russia
under
a
flag
at
peace
with
the
porte
this
advantage
enjoyed
upon
conditions
by
most
of
the
powers
of
europe
has
hitherto
been
withheld
from
us
during
the
past
summer
an
antecedent
but
unsuccessful
attempt
to
obtain
it
was
renewed
under
circumstances
which
promised
the
most
favorable
results
although
these
results
have
fortunately
been
thus
in
part
attained
further
facilities
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
new
field
for
the
enterprise
of
our
citizens
are
in
my
opinion
sufficiently
desirable
to
insure
to
them
our
most
zealous
attention
our
trade
with
austria
although
of
secondary
importance
has
been
gradually
increasing
and
is
now
so
extended
as
to
deserve
the
fostering
care
of
the
government
a
negotiation
commenced
and
nearly
completed
with
that
power
by
the
late
administration
has
been
consummated
by
a
treaty
of
amity
navigation
and
commerce
which
will
be
laid
before
the
senate
during
the
recess
of
congress
our
diplomatic
relations
with
portugal
have
been
resumed
the
peculiar
state
of
things
in
that
country
caused
a
suspension
of
the
recognition
of
the
representative
who
presented
himself
until
an
opportunity
was
had
to
obtain
from
our
official
organ
there
information
regarding
the
actual
and
as
far
as
practicable
prospective
condition
of
the
authority
by
which
the
representative
in
question
was
appointed
this
information
being
received
the
application
of
the
established
rule
of
our
government
in
like
cases
was
no
longer
withheld
considerable
advances
have
been
made
during
the
present
year
in
the
adjustment
of
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
denmark
for
spoliations
but
all
that
we
have
a
right
to
demand
from
that
government
in
their
behalf
has
not
yet
been
conceded
from
the
liberal
footing
however
upon
which
this
subject
has
with
the
approbation
of
the
claimants
been
placed
by
the
government
together
with
the
uniformly
just
and
friendly
disposition
which
has
been
evinced
by
his
danish
majesty
there
is
a
reasonable
ground
to
hope
that
this
single
subject
of
difference
will
speedily
be
removed
our
relations
with
the
barbary
powers
continue
as
they
have
long
been
of
the
most
favorable
character
the
policy
of
keeping
an
adequate
force
in
the

mediterranean
as
security
for
the
continuance
of
this
tranquillity
will
be
persevered
in
as
well
as
a
similar
one
for
the
protection
of
our
commerce
and
fisheries
in
the
pacific
the
southern
republics
of
our
own
hemisphere
have
not
yet
realized
all
the
advantages
for
which
they
have
been
so
long
struggling
we
trust
however
that
the
day
is
not
distant
when
the
restoration
of
peace
and
internal
quiet
under
permanent
systems
of
government
securing
the
liberty
and
promoting
the
happiness
of
the
citizens
will
crown
with
complete
success
their
long
and
arduous
efforts
in
the
cause
of
selfgovernment
and
enable
us
to
salute
them
as
friendly
rivals
in
all
that
is
truly
great
and
glorious
the
recent
invasion
of
mexico
and
the
effect
thereby
produced
upon
her
domestic
policy
must
have
a
controlling
influence
upon
the
great
question
of
south
american
emancipation
we
have
seen
the
fell
spirit
of
civil
dissension
rebuked
and
perhaps
for
ever
stifled
in
that
republic
by
the
love
of
independence
if
it
be
true
as
appearances
strongly
indicate
the
spirit
of
independence
is
the
master
spirit
and
if
a
corresponding
sentiment
prevails
in
the
other
states
this
devotion
to
liberty
can
not
be
without
a
proper
effect
upon
the
counsels
of
the
mother
country
the
adoption
by
spain
of
a
pacific
policy
toward
her
former
coloniesan
event
consoling
to
humanity
and
a
blessing
to
the
world
in
which
she
herself
can
not
fail
largely
to
participatemay
be
most
reasonably
expected
the
claims
of
our
citizens
upon
the
south
american
governments
generally
are
in
a
train
of
settlement
while
the
principal
part
of
those
upon
brazil
have
been
adjusted
and
a
decree
in
council
ordering
bonds
to
be
issued
by
the
minister
of
the
treasury
for
their
amount
has
received
the
sanction
of
his
imperial
majesty
this
event
together
with
the
exchange
of
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
negotiated
and
concluded
in
happily
terminates
all
serious
causes
of
difference
with
that
power
measures
have
been
taken
to
place
our
commercial
relations
with
peru
upon
a
better
footing
than
that
upon
which
they
have
hitherto
rested
and
if
met
by
a
proper
disposition
on
the
part
of
that
government
important
benefits
may
be
secured
to
both
countries
deeply
interested
as
we
are
in
the
prosperity
of
our
sister
republics
and
more
particularly
in
that
of
our
immediate
neighbor
it
would
be
most
gratifying
to
me
were
i
permitted
to
say
that
the
treatment
which
we
have
received
at
her
hands
has
been
as
universally
friendly
as
the
early
and
constant
solicitude
manifested
by
the
united
states
for
her
success
gave
us
a
right
to
expect
but
it
becomes
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
prejudices
long
indulged
by
a
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
mexico
against
the
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
of
the
united
states
have
had
an
unfortunate
influence
upon
the
affairs
of
the
two
countries
and
have
diminished
that
usefulness
to
his
own
which
was
justly
to
be
expected
from
his
talents
and
zeal
to
this
cause
in
a
great
degree
is
to
be
imputed
the
failure
of
several
measures
equally
interesting
to
both
parties
but
particularly
that
of
the
mexican
government
to
ratify
a
treaty
negotiated
and
concluded
in
its
own
capital
and
under
its
own
eye
under
these
circumstances
it
appeared
expedient
to
give
to
mr
poinsett
the
option
either
to
return
or
not
as
in
his
judgment
the
interest
of
his
country
might
require
and
instructions
to
that
end
were
prepared
but
before
they
could
be
dispatched
a
communication
was
received
from
the
government
of
mexico
through
its
charge
daffaires
here
requesting
the
recall
of
our
minister
this
was
promptly
complied
with
and
a
representative
of
a
rank
corresponding
with
that
of
the
mexican
diplomatic
agent
near
this
government
was
appointed
our
conduct
toward
that
republic
has
been
uniformly
of
the
most
friendly
character
and
having
thus
removed
the
only
alleged
obstacle
to
harmonious
intercourse
i
can
not
but
hope
that
an
advantageous
change
will
occur
in
our
affairs
in
justice
to
mr
poinsett
it
is
proper
to
say
that
my
immediate
compliance
with
the
application
for
his
recall
and
the
appointment
of
a
successor
are
not
to
be
ascribed
to
any
evidence
that
the
imputation
of
an
improper
interference
by
him
in
the
local
politics
of
mexico
was
well
founded
nor
to
a
want
of
confidence
in
his
talents
or
integrity
and
to
add
that
the
truth
of
the
charges
has
never
been
affirmed
by
the
federal
government
of
mexico
in
its
communications
with
us
i
consider
it
one
of
the
most
urgent
of
my
duties
to
bring
to
your
attention
the
propriety
of
amending
that
part
of
the
constitution
which
relates
to
the
election
of
president
and
vicepresident
our
system
of
government
was
by
its
framers
deemed
an
experiment
and
they
therefore
consistently
provided
a
mode
of
remedying
its
defects
to
the
people
belongs
the
right
of
electing
their
chief
magistrate
it
was
never
designed
that
their
choice
should
in
any
case
be
defeated
either
by
the
intervention
of
electoral
colleges
or
by
the
agency
confided
under
certain
contingencies
to
the
house
of
representatives
experience
proves
that
in
proportion
as
agents
to
execute
the
will
of
the
people
are
multiplied
there
is
danger
of
their
wishes
being
frustrated
some
may
be
unfaithful
all
are
liable
to
err
so
far
therefore
as
the
people
can
with
convenience
speak
it
is
safer
for
them
to
express
their
own
will
the
number
of
aspirants
to
the
presidency
and
the
diversity
of
the
interests
which
may
influence
their
claims
leave
little
reason
to
expect
a
choice
in
the
first
instance
and
in
that
event
the
election
must
devolve
on
the
house
of
representatives
where
it
is
obvious
the
will
of
the
people
may
not
be
always
ascertained
or
if
ascertained
may
not
be
regarded
from
the
mode
of
voting
by
states
the
choice
is
to
be
made
by
votes
and
it
may
often
occur
that
one
of
these
will
be
controlled
by
an
individual
representative
honors
and
offices
are
at
the
disposal
of
the
successful
candidate
repeated
ballotings
may
make
it
apparent
that
a
single
individual
holds
the
cast
in
his
hand
may
he
not
be
tempted
to
name
his
reward
but
even
without
corruption
supposing
the
probity
of
the
representative
to
be
proof
against
the
powerful
motives
by
which
it
may
be
assailed
the
will
of
the
people
is
still
constantly
liable
to
be
misrepresented
one
may
err
from
ignorance
of
the
wishes
of
his
constituents
another
from
a
conviction
that
it
is
his
duty
to
be
governed
by
his
own
judgment
of
the
fitness
of
the
candidates
finally
although
all
were
inflexibly
honest
all
accurately
informed
of
the
wishes
of
their
constituents
yet
under
the
present
mode
of
election
a
minority
may
often
elect
a
president
and
when
this
happens
it
may
reasonably
be
expected
that
efforts
will
be
made
on
the
part
of
the
majority
to
rectify
this
injurious
operation
of
their
institutions
but
although
no
evil
of
this
character
should
result
from
such
a
perversion
of
the
first
principle
of
our
systemthat
the
majority
is
to
governit
must
be
very
certain
that
a
president
elected
by
a
minority
can
not
enjoy
the
confidence
necessary
to
the
successful
discharge
of
his
duties
in
this
as
in
all
other
matters
of
public
concern
policy
requires
that
as
few
impediments
as
possible
should
exist
to
the
free
operation
of
the
public
will
let
us
then
endeavor
so
to
amend
our
system
that
the
office
of
chief
magistrate
may
not
be
conferred
upon
any
citizen
but
in
pursuance
of
a
fair
expression
of
the
will
of
the
majority
i
would
therefore
recommend
such
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
as
may
remove
all
intermediate
agency
in
the
election
of
the
president
and
vicepresident
the
mode
may
be
so
regulated
as
to
preserve
to
each
state
its
present
relative
weight
in
the
election
and
a
failure
in
the
first
attempt
may
be
provided
for
by
confining
the
second
to
a
choice
between
the
two
highest
candidates
in
connection
with
such
an
amendment
it
would
seem
advisable
to
limit
the
service
of
the
chief
magistrate
to
a
single
term
of
either
four
or
six
years
if
however
it
should
not
be
adopted
it
is
worthy
of
consideration
whether
a
provision
disqualifying
for
office
the
representatives
in
congress
on
whom
such
an
election
may
have
devolved
would
not
be
proper
while
members
of
congress
can
be
constitutionally
appointed
to
offices
of
trust
and
profit
it
will
be
the
practice
even
under
the
most
conscientious
adherence
to
duty
to
select
them
for
such
stations
as
they
are
believed
to
be
better
qualified
to
fill
than
other
citizens
but
the
purity
of
our
government
would
doubtless
be
promoted
by
their
exclusion
from
all
appointments
in
the
gift
of
the
president
in
whose
election
they
may
have
been
officially
concerned
the
nature
of
the
judicial
office
and
the
necessity
of
securing
in
the
cabinet
and
in
diplomatic
stations
of
the
highest
rank
the
best
talents
and
political
experience
should
perhaps
except
these
from
the
exclusion
there
are
perhaps
few
men
who
can
for
any
great
length
of
time
enjoy
office
and
power
without
being
more
or
less
under
the
influence
of
feelings
unfavorable
to
the
faithful
discharge
of
their
public
duties
their
integrity
may
be
proof
against
improper
considerations
immediately
addressed
to
themselves
but
they
are
apt
to
acquire
a
habit
of
looking
with
indifference
upon
the
public
interests
and
of
tolerating
conduct
from
which
an
unpracticed
man
would
revolt
office
is
considered
as
a
species
of
property
and
government
rather
as
a
means
of
promoting
individual
interests
than
as
an
instrument
created
solely
for
the
service
of
the
people
corruption
in
some
and
in
others
a
perversion
of
correct
feelings
and
principles
divert
government
from
its
legitimate
ends
and
make
it
an
engine
for
the
support
of
the
few
at
the
expense
of
the
many
the
duties
of
all
public
officers
are
or
at
least
admit
of
being
made
so
plain
and
simple
that
men
of
intelligence
may
readily
qualify
themselves
for
their
performance
and
i
can
not
but
believe
that
more
is
lost
by
the
long
continuance
of
men
in
office
than
is
generally
to
be
gained
by
their
experience
i
submi
t
therefore
to
your
consideration
whether
the
efficiency
of
the
government
would
not
be
promoted
and
official
industry
and
integrity
better
secured
by
a
general
extension
of
the
law
which
limits
appointments
to
four
years
in
a
country
where
offices
are
created
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
no
one
man
has
any
more
intrinsic
right
to
official
station
than
another
offices
were
not
established
to
give
support
to
particular
men
at
the
public
expense
no
individual
wrong
is
therefore
done
by
removal
since
neither
appointment
to
nor
continuance
in
office
is
a
matter
of
right
the
incumbent
became
an
officer
with
a
view
to
public
benefits
and
when
these
require
his
removal
they
are
not
to
be
sacrificed
to
private
interests
it
is
the
people
and
they
alone
who
have
a
right
to
complain
when
a
bad
officer
is
substituted
for
a
good
one
he
who
is
removed
has
the
same
means
of
obtaining
a
living
that
are
enjoyed
by
the
millions
who
never
held
office
the
proposed
limitation
would
destroy
the
idea
of
property
now
so
generally
connected
with
official
station
and
although
individual
distress
may
be
some
times
produced
it
would
by
promoting
that
rotation
which
constitutes
a
leading
principle
in
the
republican
creed
give
healthful
action
to
the
system
no
very
considerable
change
has
occurred
during
the
recess
of
congress
in
the
condition
of
either
our
agriculture
commerce
or
manufactures
the
operation
of
the
tariff
has
not
proved
so
injurious
to
the
two
former
or
as
beneficial
to
the
latter
as
was
anticipated
importations
of
foreign
goods
have
not
been
sensibly
diminished
while
domestic
competition
under
an
illusive
excitement
has
increased
the
production
much
beyond
the
demand
for
home
consumption
the
consequences
have
been
low
prices
temporary
embarrassment
and
partial
loss
that
such
of
our
manufacturing
establishments
as
are
based
upon
capital
and
are
prudently
managed
will
survive
the
shock
and
be
ultimately
profitable
there
is
no
good
reason
to
doubt
to
regulate
its
conduct
so
as
to
promote
equally
the
prosperity
of
these
three
cardinal
interests
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
tasks
of
government
and
it
may
be
regretted
that
the
complicated
restrictions
which
now
embarrass
the
intercourse
of
nations
could
not
by
common
consent
be
abolished
and
commerce
allowed
to
flow
in
those
channels
to
which
individual
enterprise
always
its
surest
guide
might
direct
it
but
we
must
ever
expect
selfish
legislation
in
other
nations
and
are
therefore
compelled
to
adapt
our
own
to
their
regulations
in
the
manner
best
calculated
to
avoid
serious
injury
and
to
harmonize
the
conflicting
interests
of
our
agriculture
our
commerce
and
our
manufactures
under
these
impressions
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
existing
tariff
believing
that
some
of
its
provisions
require
modification
the
general
rule
to
be
applied
in
graduating
the
duties
upon
articles
of
foreign
growth
or
manufacture
is
that
which
will
place
our
own
in
fair
competition
with
those
of
other
countries
and
the
inducements
to
advance
even
a
step
beyond
this
point
are
controlling
in
regard
to
those
articles
which
are
of
primary
necessity
in
time
of
war
when
we
reflect
upon
the
difficulty
and
delicacy
of
this
operation
it
is
important
that
it
should
never
be
attempted
but
with
the
utmost
caution
frequent
legislation
in
regard
to
any
branch
of
industry
affecting
its
value
and
by
which
its
capital
may
be
transferred
to
new
channels
must
always
be
productive
of
hazardous
speculation
and
loss
in
deliberating
therefore
on
these
interesting
subjects
local
feelings
and
prejudices
should
be
merged
in
the
patriotic
determination
to
promote
the
great
interests
of
the
whole
all
attempts
to
connect
them
with
the
party
conflicts
of
the
day
are
necessarily
injurious
and
should
be
discountenanced
our
action
upon
them
should
be
under
the
control
of
higher
and
purer
motives
legislation
subjected
to
such
influences
can
never
be
just
and
will
not
long
retain
the
sanction
of
a
people
whose
active
patriotism
is
not
bounded
by
sectional
limits
nor
insensible
to
that
spirit
of
concession
and
forbearance
which
gave
life
to
our
political
compact
and
still
sustains
it
discarding
all
calculations
of
political
ascendancy
the
north
the
south
the
east
and
the
west
should
unite
in
diminishing
any
burthen
of
which
either
may
justly
complain
the
agricultural
interest
of
our
country
is
so
essentially
connected
with
every
other
and
so
superior
in
importance
to
them
all
that
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
invite
to
it
your
particular
attention
it
is
principally
as
manufactures
and
commerce
tend
to
increase
the
value
of
agricultural
productions
and
to
extend
their
application
to
the
wants
and
comforts
of
society
that
they
deserve
the
fostering
care
of
government
looking
forward
to
the
period
not
far
distant
when
a
sinking
fund
will
no
longer
be
required
the
duties
on
those
articles
of
importation
which
can
not
come
in
competition
with
our
own
productions
are
the
first
that
should
engage
the
attention
of
congress
in
the
modification
of
the
tariff
of
these
tea
and
coffee
are
the
most
important
they
enter
largely
into
the
consumption
of
the
country
and
have
become
articles
of
necessity
to
all
classes
a
reduction
therefore
of
the
existing
duties
will
be
felt
as
a
common
benefit
but
like
all
other
legislation
connected
with
commerce
to
be
efficacious
and
not
injurious
it
should
be
gradual
and
certain
the
public
prosperity
is
evinced
in
the
increased
revenue
arising
from
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
and
in
the
steady
maintenance
of
that
produced
by
imposts
and
tonnage
not
withstanding
the
additional
duties
imposed
by
the
act
of
may
th
and
the
unusual
importations
in
the
early
part
of
that
year
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
january
st
was
the
receipts
of
the
current
year
are
estimated
at
and
the
expenditures
for
the
same
time
at
leaving
a
balance
in
the
treasury
on
january
st
of
there
will
have
been
paid
on
account
of
the
public
debt
during
the
present
year
the
sum
of
reducing
the
whole
debt
of
the
government
on
january
st
to
including
millions
of
the
stock
subscribed
to
the
bank
of
the
united
states
the
payment
on
account
of
public
debt
made
on
july
st
was
it
was
apprehended
that
the
sudden
withdrawal
of
so
large
a
sum
from
the
banks
in
which
it
was
deposited
at
a
time
of
unusual
pressure
in
the
money
market
might
cause
much
injury
to
the
interests
dependent
on
bank
accommodations
but
this
evil
was
wholly
averted
by
an
early
anticipation
of
it
at
the
treasury
aided
by
the
judicious
arrangements
of
the
officers
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
this
state
of
the
finances
exhibits
the
resources
of
the
nation
in
an
aspect
highly
flattering
to
its
industry
and
auspicious
of
the
ability
of
government
in
a
very
short
time
to
extinguish
the
public
debt
when
this
shall
be
done
our
population
will
be
relieved
from
a
considerable
portion
of
its
present
burthens
and
will
find
not
only
new
motives
to
patriotic
affection
but
additional
means
for
the
display
of
individual
enterprise
the
fiscal
power
of
the
states
will
also
be
increased
and
may
be
more
extensively
exerted
in
favor
of
education
and
other
public
objects
while
ample
means
will
remain
in
the
federal
government
to
promote
the
general
weal
in
all
the
modes
permitted
to
its
authority
after
the
extinction
of
the
public
debt
it
is
not
probable
that
any
adjustment
of
the
tariff
upon
principles
satisfactory
to
the
people
of
the
union
will
until
a
remote
period
if
ever
leave
the
government
without
a
considerable
surplus
in
the
treasury
beyond
what
may
be
required
for
its
current
service
as
then
the
period
approaches
when
the
application
of
the
revenue
to
the
payment
of
debt
will
cease
the
disposition
of
the
surplus
will
present
a
subject
for
the
serious
deliberation
of
congress
and
it
may
be
fortunate
for
the
country
that
it
is
yet
to
be
decided
considered
in
connection
with
the
difficulties
which
have
heretofore
attended
appropriations
for
purposes
of
internal
improvement
and
with
those
which
this
experience
tells
us
will
certainly
arise
when
ever
power
over
such
subjects
may
be
exercised
by
the
central
government
it
is
hoped
that
it
may
lead
to
the
adoption
of
some
plan
which
will
reconcile
the
diversified
interests
of
the
states
and
strengthen
the
bonds
which
unite
them
every
member
of
the
union
in
peace
and
in
war
will
be
benefited
by
the
improvement
of
inland
navigation
and
the
construction
of
high
ways
in
the
several
states
let
us
then
endeavor
to
attain
this
benefit
in
a
mode
which
will
be
satisfactory
to
all
that
hitherto
adopted
has
by
many
of
our
fellow
citizens
been
deprecated
as
an
infraction
of
the
constitution
while
by
others
it
has
been
viewed
as
inexpedient
all
feel
that
it
has
been
employed
at
the
expense
of
harmony
in
the
legislative
councils
to
avoid
these
evils
it
appears
to
me
that
the
most
safe
just
and
federal
disposition
which
could
be
made
of
the
surplus
revenue
would
be
its
apportionment
among
the
several
states
according
to
their
ratio
of
representation
and
should
this
measure
not
be
found
warranted
by
the
constitution
that
it
would
be
expedient
to
propose
to
the
states
an
amendment
authorizing
it
i
regard
an
appeal
to
the
source
of
power
in
cases
of
real
doubt
and
where
its
exercise
is
deemed
indispensable
to
the
general
welfare
as
among
the
most
sacred
of
all
our
obligations
upon
this
country
more
than
any
other
has
in
the
providence
of
god
been
cast
the
special
guardianship
of
the
great
principle
of
adherence
to
written
constitutions
if
it
fail
here
all
hope
in
regard
to
it
will
be
extinguished
that
this
was
intended
to
be
a
government
of
limited
and
specific
and
not
general
powers
must
be
admitted
by
all
and
it
is
our
duty
to
preserve
for
it
the
character
intended
by
its
framers
if
experience
points
out
the
necessity
for
an
enlargement
of
these
powers
let
us
apply
for
it
to
those
for
whose
benefit
it
is
to
be
exercised
and
not
undermine
the
whole
system
by
a
resort
to
overstrained
constructions
the
scheme
has
worked
well
it
has
exceeded
the
hopes
of
those
who
dev
ised
it
and
become
an
object
of
admiration
to
the
world
we
are
responsible
to
our
country
and
to
the
glorious
cause
of
selfgovernment
for
the
preservation
of
so
great
a
good
the
great
mass
of
legislation
relating
to
our
internal
affairs
was
intended
to
be
left
where
the
federal
convention
found
itin
the
state
governments
nothing
is
clearer
in
my
view
than
that
we
are
chiefly
indebted
for
the
success
of
the
constitution
under
which
we
are
now
acting
to
the
watchful
and
auxiliary
operation
of
the
state
authorities
this
is
not
the
reflection
of
a
day
but
belongs
to
the
most
deeply
rooted
convictions
of
my
mind
i
can
not
therefore
too
strongly
or
too
earnestly
for
my
own
sense
of
its
importance
warn
you
against
all
encroachments
upon
the
legitimate
sphere
of
state
sovereignty
sustained
by
its
healthful
and
invigorating
influence
the
federal
system
can
never
fall
in
the
collection
of
the
revenue
the
long
credits
authorized
on
goods
imported
from
beyond
the
cape
of
good
hope
are
the
chief
cause
of
the
losses
at
present
sustained
if
these
were
shortened
to
and
months
and
warehouses
provided
by
government
sufficient
to
receive
the
goods
offered
in
deposit
for
security
and
for
debenture
and
if
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
a
priority
of
payment
out
of
the
estates
of
its
insolvent
debtors
were
more
effectually
secured
this
evil
would
in
a
great
measure
be
obviated
an
authority
to
construct
such
houses
is
therefore
with
the
proposed
alteration
of
the
credits
recommended
to
your
attention
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
the
laws
for
the
collection
and
security
of
the
revenue
arising
from
imposts
were
chiefly
framed
when
the
rates
of
duties
on
imported
goods
presented
much
less
temptation
for
illicit
trade
than
at
present
exists
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
these
laws
are
in
some
respects
quite
insufficient
for
the
proper
security
of
the
revenue
and
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
those
who
are
disposed
to
observe
them
the
injurious
and
demoralizing
tendency
of
a
successful
system
of
smuggling
is
so
obvious
as
not
to
require
comment
and
can
not
be
too
carefully
guarded
against
i
therefore
suggest
to
congress
the
propriety
of
adopting
efficient
measures
to
prevent
this
evil
avoiding
however
as
much
as
possible
every
unnecessary
infringement
of
individual
liberty
and
embarrassment
of
fair
and
lawful
business
on
an
examination
of
the
records
of
the
treasury
i
have
been
forcibly
struck
with
the
large
amount
of
public
money
which
appears
to
be
outstanding
of
the
sum
thus
due
from
individuals
to
the
government
a
considerable
portion
is
undoubtedly
desperate
and
in
many
instances
has
probably
been
rendered
so
by
remissness
in
the
agents
charged
with
its
collection
by
proper
exertions
a
great
part
however
may
yet
be
recovered
and
what
ever
may
be
the
portions
respectively
belonging
to
these
two
classes
it
behooves
the
government
to
ascertain
the
real
state
of
the
fact
this
can
be
done
only
by
the
prompt
adoption
of
judicious
measures
for
the
collection
of
such
as
may
be
made
available
it
is
believed
that
a
very
large
amount
has
been
lost
through
the
inadequacy
of
the
means
provided
for
the
collection
of
debts
due
to
the
public
and
that
this
inadequacy
lies
chiefly
in
the
want
of
legal
skill
habitually
and
constantly
employed
in
the
direction
of
the
agents
engaged
in
the
service
it
must
i
think
be
admitted
that
the
supervisory
power
over
suits
brought
by
the
public
which
is
now
vested
in
an
accounting
officer
of
the
treasury
not
selected
with
a
view
to
his
legal
knowledge
and
encumbered
as
he
is
with
numerous
other
duties
operates
unfavorably
to
the
public
interest
it
is
important
that
this
branch
of
the
public
service
should
be
subjected
to
the
supervision
of
such
professional
skill
as
will
give
it
efficiency
the
expense
attendant
upon
such
a
modification
of
the
executive
department
would
be
justified
by
the
soundest
principles
of
economy
i
would
recommend
therefore
that
the
duties
now
assigned
to
the
agent
of
the
treasury
so
far
as
they
relate
to
the
superintendence
and
management
of
legal
proceedings
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
be
transferred
to
the
attorney
general
and
that
this
officer
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
in
all
respects
as
the
heads
of
the
other
departments
receiving
like
compensation
and
having
such
subordinate
officers
provided
for
his
department
as
may
be
requisite
for
the
discharge
of
these
additional
duties
the
professional
skill
of
the
attorney
general
employed
in
directing
the
conduct
of
marshals
and
district
attorneys
would
hasten
the
collection
of
debts
now
in
suit
and
hereafter
save
much
to
the
government
it
might
be
further
extended
to
the
superintendence
of
all
criminal
proceedings
for
offenses
against
the
united
states
in
making
this
transfer
great
care
should
be
taken
however
that
the
power
necessary
to
the
treasury
department
be
not
impaired
one
of
its
greatest
securities
consisting
in
control
over
all
accounts
until
they
are
audited
or
reported
for
suit
in
connection
with
the
foregoing
views
i
would
suggest
also
an
inquiry
whether
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
authorizing
the
discharge
of
the
persons
of
the
debtors
to
the
government
from
imprisonment
may
not
consistently
with
the
public
interest
be
extended
to
the
release
of
the
debt
where
the
conduct
of
the
debtor
is
wholly
exempt
from
the
imputation
of
fraud
some
more
liberal
policy
than
that
which
now
prevails
in
reference
to
this
unfortunate
class
of
citizens
is
certainly
due
to
them
and
would
prove
beneficial
to
the
country
the
continuance
of
the
liability
after
the
means
to
discharge
it
have
been
exhausted
can
only
serve
to
dispirit
the
debtor
or
where
his
resources
are
but
partial
the
want
of
power
in
the
government
to
compromise
and
release
the
demand
instigates
to
fraud
as
the
only
resource
for
securing
a
support
to
his
family
he
thus
sinks
into
a
state
of
apathy
and
becomes
a
useless
drone
in
society
or
a
vicious
member
of
it
if
not
a
feeling
witness
of
the
rigor
and
inhumanity
of
his
country
all
experience
proves
that
oppressive
debt
is
the
bane
of
enterprise
and
it
should
be
the
care
of
a
republic
not
to
exert
a
grinding
power
over
misfortune
and
poverty
since
the
last
session
of
congress
numerous
frauds
on
the
treasury
have
been
discovered
which
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
bring
under
the
cognizance
of
the
united
states
court
for
this
district
by
a
criminal
prosecution
it
was
my
opinion
and
that
of
able
counsel
who
were
consulted
that
the
cases
came
within
the
penalties
of
the
act
of
the
th
congress
approved
march
d
providing
for
punishment
of
frauds
committed
on
the
government
of
the
united
states
either
from
some
defect
in
the
law
or
in
its
administration
every
effort
to
bring
the
accused
to
trial
under
its
provisions
proved
ineffectual
and
the
government
was
driven
to
the
necessity
of
resorting
to
the
vague
and
inadequate
provisions
of
the
common
law
it
is
therefore
my
duty
to
call
your
attention
to
the
laws
which
have
been
passed
for
the
protection
of
the
treasury
if
indeed
there
be
no
provision
by
which
those
who
may
be
unworthily
intrusted
with
its
guardianship
can
be
punished
for
the
most
flagrant
violation
of
duty
extending
even
to
the
most
fraudulent
appropriation
of
the
public
funds
to
their
own
use
it
is
time
to
remedy
so
dangerous
an
omission
or
if
the
law
has
been
perverted
from
its
original
purposes
and
criminals
deserving
to
be
punished
under
its
provisions
have
been
rescued
by
legal
subtleties
it
ought
to
be
made
so
plain
by
amendatory
provisions
as
to
baffle
the
arts
of
perversion
and
accomplish
the
ends
of
its
original
enactment
in
one
of
the
most
flagrant
causes
the
court
decided
that
the
prosecution
was
barred
by
the
statute
which
limits
prosecutions
for
fraud
to
two
years
in
this
case
all
the
evidences
of
the
fraud
and
indeed
all
knowledge
that
a
fraud
had
been
committed
were
in
possession
of
the
party
accused
until
after
the
two
years
had
elapsed
surely
the
statute
ought
not
to
run
in
favor
of
any
man
while
he
retains
all
the
evidences
of
his
crime
in
his
own
possession
and
least
of
all
in
favor
of
a
public
officer
who
continues
to
defraud
the
treasury
and
conceal
the
transaction
for
the
brief
term
of
two
years
i
would
therefore
recommend
such
an
alteration
of
the
law
as
will
give
the
injured
party
and
the
government
two
years
after
the
disclosure
of
the
fraud
or
after
the
accused
is
out
of
office
to
commence
their
prosecution
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
a
general
and
minute
inquiry
into
the
condition
of
the
government
with
a
view
to
ascertain
what
offices
can
be
dispensed
with
what
expenses
retrenched
and
what
improvements
may
be
made
in
the
organization
of
its
various
parts
to
secure
the
proper
responsibility
of
public
agents
and
promote
efficiency
and
justice
in
all
its
operations
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
will
make
you
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
our
army
fortifications
arsenals
and
indian
affairs
the
proper
discipline
of
the
army
the
training
and
equipment
of
the
militia
the
education
bestowed
at
west
point
and
the
accumulation
of
the
means
of
defense
applicable
to
the
naval
force
will
tend
to
prolong
the
peace
we
now
enjoy
and
which
every
good
citizen
more
especially
those
who
have
felt
the
miseries
of
even
a
successful
warfare
must
ardently
desire
to
perpetuate
the
returns
from
the
subordinate
branches
of
this
service
exhibit
a
regularity
and
order
highly
creditable
to
its
character
both
officers
and
soldiers
seem
imbued
with
a
proper
sense
of
duty
and
conform
to
the
restraints
of
exact
discipline
with
that
cheerfulness
which
becomes
the
profession
of
arms
there
is
need
however
of
further
legislation
to
obviate
the
inconveniences
specified
in
the
report
under
consideration
to
some
of
which
it
is
proper
that
i
should
call
your
particular
attention
the
act
of
congress
of
march
d
to
reduce
and
fix
the
military
establishment
remaining
unexecuted
as
it
regards
the
command
of
one
of
the
regiments
of
artillery
can
not
now
be
deemed
a
guide
to
t
he
executive
in
making
the
proper
appointment
an
explanatory
act
designating
the
class
of
officers
out
of
which
the
grade
is
to
be
filledwhether
from
the
military
list
as
existing
prior
to
the
act
of
or
from
it
as
it
has
been
fixed
by
that
actwould
remove
this
difficulty
it
is
also
important
that
the
laws
regulating
the
pay
and
emoluments
of
officers
generally
should
be
more
specific
than
they
now
are
those
for
example
in
relation
to
the
pay
master
and
surgeon
general
assign
to
them
an
annual
salary
of
but
are
silent
as
to
allowances
which
in
certain
exigencies
of
the
service
may
be
deemed
indispensable
to
the
discharge
of
their
duties
this
circumstance
has
been
the
authority
for
extending
to
them
various
allowances
at
different
times
under
former
administrations
but
no
uniform
rule
has
been
observed
on
the
subject
similar
inconveniences
exist
in
other
cases
in
which
the
construction
put
upon
the
laws
by
the
public
accountants
may
operate
unequally
produce
confusion
and
expose
officers
to
the
odium
of
claiming
what
is
not
their
due
i
recommend
to
your
fostering
care
as
one
of
our
safest
means
of
national
defense
the
military
academy
this
institution
has
already
exercised
the
happiest
influence
upon
the
moral
and
intellectual
character
of
our
army
and
such
of
the
graduates
as
from
various
causes
may
not
pursue
the
profession
of
arms
will
be
scarcely
less
useful
as
citizens
their
knowledge
of
the
military
art
will
be
advantageously
employed
in
the
militia
service
and
in
a
measure
secure
to
that
class
of
troops
the
advantages
which
in
this
respect
belong
to
standing
armies
i
would
also
suggest
a
review
of
the
pension
law
for
the
purpose
of
extending
its
benefits
to
every
revolutionary
soldier
who
aided
in
establishing
our
liberties
and
who
is
unable
to
maintain
himself
in
comfort
these
relics
of
the
war
of
independence
have
strong
claims
upon
their
countrys
gratitude
and
bounty
the
law
is
defective
in
not
embracing
within
its
provisions
all
those
who
were
during
the
last
war
disabled
from
supporting
themselves
by
manual
labor
such
an
amendment
would
add
but
little
to
the
amount
of
pensions
and
is
called
for
by
the
sympathies
of
the
people
as
well
as
by
considerations
of
sound
policy
it
will
be
perceived
that
a
large
addition
to
the
list
of
pensioners
has
been
occasioned
by
an
order
of
the
late
administration
departing
materially
from
the
rules
which
had
previously
prevailed
considering
it
an
act
of
legislation
i
suspended
its
operation
as
soon
as
i
was
informed
that
it
had
commenced
before
this
period
however
applications
under
the
new
regulation
had
been
preferred
to
the
number
of
of
which
on
march
the
date
of
its
revocation
were
admitted
for
the
amount
there
was
neither
estimate
nor
appropriation
and
besides
this
deficiency
the
regular
allowances
according
to
the
rules
which
have
heretofore
governed
the
department
exceed
the
estimate
of
its
late
secretary
by
about
for
which
an
appropriation
is
asked
your
particular
attention
is
requested
to
that
part
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
which
relates
to
the
money
held
in
trust
for
the
seneca
tribe
of
indians
it
will
be
perceived
that
without
legislative
aid
the
executive
can
not
obviate
the
embarrassments
occasioned
by
the
diminution
of
the
dividends
on
that
fund
which
originally
amounted
to
and
has
recently
been
invested
in
united
states
stock
the
condition
and
ulterior
destiny
of
the
indian
tribes
within
the
limits
of
some
of
our
states
have
become
objects
of
much
interest
and
importance
it
has
long
been
the
policy
of
government
to
introduce
among
them
the
arts
of
civilization
in
the
hope
of
gradually
reclaiming
them
from
a
wandering
life
this
policy
has
however
been
coupled
with
another
wholly
incompatible
with
its
success
professing
a
desire
to
civilize
and
settle
them
we
have
at
the
same
time
lost
no
opportunity
to
purchase
their
lands
and
thrust
them
farther
into
the
wilderness
by
this
means
they
have
not
only
been
kept
in
a
wandering
state
but
been
led
to
look
upon
us
as
unjust
and
indifferent
to
their
fate
thus
though
lavish
in
its
expenditures
upon
the
subject
government
has
constantly
defeated
its
own
policy
and
the
indians
in
general
receding
farther
and
farther
to
the
west
have
retained
their
savage
habits
a
portion
however
of
the
southern
tribes
having
mingled
much
with
the
whites
and
made
some
progress
in
the
arts
of
civilized
life
have
lately
attempted
to
erect
an
independent
government
within
the
limits
of
georgia
and
alabama
these
states
claiming
to
be
the
only
sovereigns
within
their
territories
extended
their
laws
over
the
indians
which
induced
the
latter
to
call
upon
the
united
states
for
protection
under
these
circumstances
the
question
presented
was
whether
the
general
government
had
a
right
to
sustain
those
people
in
their
pretensions
the
constitution
declares
that
no
new
state
shall
be
formed
or
erected
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
other
state
without
the
consent
of
its
legislature
if
the
general
government
is
not
permitted
to
tolerate
the
erection
of
a
confederate
state
within
the
territory
of
one
of
the
members
of
this
union
against
her
consent
much
less
could
it
allow
a
foreign
and
independent
government
to
establish
itself
there
georgia
became
a
member
of
the
confederacy
which
eventuated
in
our
federal
union
as
a
sovereign
state
always
asserting
her
claim
to
certain
limits
which
having
been
originally
defined
in
her
colonial
charter
and
subsequently
recognized
in
the
treaty
of
peace
she
has
ever
since
continued
to
enjoy
except
as
they
have
been
circumscribed
by
her
own
voluntary
transfer
of
a
portion
of
her
territory
to
the
united
states
in
the
articles
of
cession
of
alabama
was
admitted
into
the
union
on
the
same
footing
with
the
original
states
with
boundaries
which
were
prescribed
by
congress
there
is
no
constitutional
conventional
or
legal
provision
which
allows
them
less
power
over
the
indians
within
their
borders
than
is
possessed
by
maine
or
new
york
would
the
people
of
maine
permit
the
penobscot
tribe
to
erect
an
independent
government
within
their
state
and
unless
they
did
would
it
not
be
the
duty
of
the
general
government
to
support
them
in
resisting
such
a
measure
would
the
people
of
new
york
permit
each
remnant
of
the
six
nations
within
her
borders
to
declare
itself
an
independent
people
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states
could
the
indians
establish
a
separate
republic
on
each
of
their
reservations
in
ohio
and
if
they
were
so
disposed
would
it
be
the
duty
of
this
government
to
protect
them
in
the
attempt
if
the
principle
involved
in
the
obvious
answer
to
these
questions
be
abandoned
it
will
follow
that
the
objects
of
this
government
are
reversed
and
that
it
has
become
a
part
of
its
duty
to
aid
in
destroying
the
states
which
it
was
established
to
protect
actuated
by
this
view
of
the
subject
i
informed
the
indians
inhabiting
parts
of
georgia
and
alabama
that
their
attempt
to
establish
an
independent
government
would
not
be
countenanced
by
the
executive
of
the
united
states
and
advised
them
to
emigrate
beyond
the
mississippi
or
submit
to
the
laws
of
those
states
our
conduct
toward
these
people
is
deeply
interesting
to
our
national
character
their
present
condition
contrasted
with
what
they
once
were
makes
a
most
powerful
appeal
to
our
sympathies
our
ancestors
found
them
the
uncontrolled
possessors
of
these
vast
regions
by
persuasion
and
force
they
have
been
made
to
retire
from
river
to
river
and
from
mountain
to
mountain
until
some
of
the
tribes
have
become
extinct
and
others
have
left
but
remnants
to
preserve
for
a
while
their
once
terrible
names
surrounded
by
the
whites
with
their
arts
of
civilization
which
by
destroying
the
resources
of
the
savage
doom
him
to
weakness
and
decay
the
fate
of
the
mohegan
the
narragansett
and
the
delaware
is
fast
overtaking
the
choctaw
the
cherokee
and
the
creek
that
this
fate
surely
awaits
them
if
they
remain
within
the
limits
of
the
states
does
not
admit
of
a
doubt
humanity
and
national
honor
demand
that
every
effort
should
be
made
to
avert
so
great
a
calamity
it
is
too
late
to
inquire
whether
it
was
just
in
the
united
states
to
include
them
and
their
territory
within
the
bounds
of
new
states
whose
limits
they
could
control
that
step
can
not
be
retraced
a
state
can
not
be
dismembered
by
congress
or
restricted
in
the
exercise
of
her
constitutional
power
but
the
people
of
those
states
and
of
every
state
actuated
by
feelings
of
justice
and
a
regard
for
our
national
honor
submit
to
you
the
interesting
question
whether
something
can
not
be
done
consistently
with
the
rights
of
the
states
to
preserve
this
muchinjured
race
as
a
means
of
effecting
this
end
i
suggest
for
your
consideration
the
propriety
of
setting
apart
an
ample
district
west
of
the
mississippi
and
without
the
limits
of
any
state
or
territory
now
formed
to
be
guaranteed
to
the
indian
tribes
as
long
as
they
shall
occupy
it
each
tribe
having
a
distinct
control
over
the
portion
designated
for
its
use
there
they
may
be
secured
in
the
enjoyment
of
governments
of
their
own
choice
subject
to
no
other
control
from
the
united
states
than
such
as
may
be
necessary
to
preserve
peace
on
the
frontier
and
between
the
several
tribes
there
the
benevolent
may
endeavor
to
teach
them
the
arts
of
civilization
and
by
promoting
union
and
harmony
among
them
to
raise
up
an
interesting
commonwealth
destined
to
perpetuate
the
race
and
to
attest
the
humanity
and
justice
of
this
government
this
emigration
should
be
voluntary
for
it
would
be
as
cruel
as
unjust
to
compel
the
aborigines
to
abandon
the
graves
of
their
fathers
and
seek
a
home
in
a
distant
land
but
they
should
be
distinctly
informed
that
if
they
remain
within
the
limits
of
the
states
they
must
be
subject
to
their
laws
in
return
for
their
obedience
as
individuals
they
will
without
doubt
be
protected
in
the
enjoyment
of
those
possessions
which
they
have
improved
by
their
industry
but
it
seems
to
me
visionary
to
suppose
that
in
this
state
of
things
claims
can
be
allowed
on
tracts
of
country
o
n
which
they
have
neither
dwelt
nor
made
improvements
merely
because
they
have
seen
them
from
the
mountain
or
passed
them
in
the
chase
submitting
to
the
laws
of
the
states
and
receiving
like
other
citizens
protection
in
their
persons
and
property
they
will
ere
long
become
merged
in
the
mass
of
our
population
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
will
make
you
acquainted
with
the
condition
and
useful
employment
of
that
branch
of
our
service
during
the
present
year
constituting
as
it
does
the
best
standing
security
of
this
country
against
foreign
aggression
it
claims
the
especial
attention
of
government
in
this
spirit
the
measures
which
since
the
termination
of
the
last
war
have
been
in
operation
for
its
gradual
enlargement
were
adopted
and
it
should
continue
to
be
cherished
as
the
offspring
of
our
national
experience
it
will
be
seen
however
that
not
withstanding
the
great
solicitude
which
has
been
manifested
for
the
perfect
organization
of
this
arm
and
the
liberality
of
the
appropriations
which
that
solicitude
has
suggested
this
object
has
in
many
important
respects
not
been
secured
in
time
of
peace
we
have
need
of
no
more
ships
of
war
than
are
requisite
to
the
protection
of
our
commerce
those
not
wanted
for
this
object
must
lay
in
the
harbors
where
without
proper
covering
they
rapidly
decay
and
even
under
the
best
precautions
for
their
preservation
must
soon
become
useless
such
is
already
the
case
with
many
of
our
finest
vessels
which
though
unfinished
will
now
require
immense
sums
of
money
to
be
restored
to
the
condition
in
which
they
were
when
committed
to
their
proper
element
on
this
subject
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
that
our
best
policy
would
be
to
discontinue
the
building
of
ships
of
the
first
and
second
class
and
look
rather
to
the
possession
of
ample
materials
prepared
for
the
emergencies
of
war
than
to
the
number
of
vessels
which
we
can
float
in
a
season
of
peace
as
the
index
of
our
naval
power
judicious
deposits
in
navy
yards
of
timber
and
other
materials
fashioned
under
the
hands
of
skillful
workmen
and
fitted
for
prompt
application
to
their
various
purposes
would
enable
us
at
all
times
to
construct
vessels
as
fast
as
they
can
be
manned
and
save
the
heavy
expense
of
repairs
except
to
such
vessels
as
must
be
employed
in
guarding
our
commerce
the
proper
points
for
the
establishment
of
these
yards
are
indicated
with
so
much
force
in
the
report
of
the
navy
board
that
in
recommending
it
to
your
attention
i
deem
it
unnecessary
to
do
more
than
express
my
hearty
concurrence
in
their
views
the
yard
in
this
district
being
already
furnished
with
most
of
the
machinery
necessary
for
ship
building
will
be
competent
to
the
supply
of
the
two
selected
by
the
board
as
the
best
for
the
concentration
of
materials
and
from
the
facility
and
certainty
of
communication
between
them
it
will
be
useless
to
incur
at
those
depots
the
expense
of
similar
machinery
especially
that
used
in
preparing
the
usual
metallic
and
wooden
furniture
of
vessels
another
improvement
would
be
effected
by
dispensing
altogether
with
the
navy
board
as
now
constituted
and
substituting
in
its
stead
bureaux
similar
to
those
already
existing
in
the
war
department
each
member
of
the
board
transferred
to
the
head
of
a
separate
bureau
charged
with
specific
duties
would
feel
in
its
highest
degree
that
wholesome
responsibility
which
can
not
be
divided
without
a
far
more
than
proportionate
diminution
of
its
force
their
valuable
services
would
become
still
more
so
when
separately
appropriated
to
distinct
portions
of
the
great
interests
of
the
navy
to
the
prosperity
of
which
each
would
be
impelled
to
devote
himself
by
the
strongest
motives
under
such
an
arrangement
every
branch
of
this
important
service
would
assume
a
more
simple
and
precise
character
its
efficiency
would
be
increased
and
scrupulous
economy
in
the
expenditure
of
public
money
promoted
i
would
also
recommend
that
the
marine
corps
be
merged
in
the
artillery
or
infantry
as
the
best
mode
of
curing
the
many
defects
in
its
organization
but
little
exceeding
in
number
any
of
the
regiments
of
infantry
that
corps
has
besides
its
lieutenantcolonel
commandant
five
brevet
lieutenantcolonels
who
receive
the
full
pay
and
emoluments
of
their
brevet
rank
without
rendering
proportionate
service
details
for
marine
service
could
as
well
be
made
from
the
artillery
or
infantry
there
being
no
peculiar
training
requisite
for
it
with
these
improvements
and
such
others
as
zealous
watchfulness
and
mature
consideration
may
suggest
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
under
an
energetic
administration
of
its
affairs
the
navy
may
soon
be
made
every
thing
that
the
nation
wishes
it
to
be
its
efficiency
in
the
suppression
of
piracy
in
the
west
india
seas
and
wherever
its
squadrons
have
been
employed
in
securing
the
interests
of
the
country
will
appear
from
the
report
of
the
secretary
to
which
i
refer
you
for
other
interesting
details
among
these
i
would
bespeak
the
attention
of
congress
for
the
views
presented
in
relation
to
the
inequality
between
the
army
and
navy
as
to
the
pay
of
officers
no
such
inequality
should
prevail
between
these
brave
defenders
of
their
country
and
where
it
does
exist
it
is
submitted
to
congress
whether
it
ought
not
to
be
rectified
the
report
of
the
post
master
general
is
referred
to
as
exhibiting
a
highly
satisfactory
administration
of
that
department
abuses
have
been
reformed
increased
expedition
in
the
transportation
of
the
mail
secured
and
its
revenue
much
improved
in
a
political
point
of
view
this
department
is
chiefly
important
as
affording
the
means
of
diffusing
knowledge
it
is
to
the
body
politic
what
the
veins
and
arteries
are
to
the
naturalconveying
rapidly
and
regularly
to
the
remotest
parts
of
the
system
correct
information
of
the
operations
of
the
government
and
bringing
back
to
it
the
wishes
and
feelings
of
the
people
through
its
agency
we
have
secured
to
ourselves
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
blessings
of
a
free
press
in
this
general
survey
of
our
affairs
a
subject
of
high
importance
presents
itself
in
the
present
organization
of
the
judiciary
an
uniform
operation
of
the
federal
government
in
the
different
states
is
certainly
desirable
and
existing
as
they
do
in
the
union
on
the
basis
of
perfect
equality
each
state
has
a
right
to
expect
that
the
benefits
conferred
on
the
citizens
of
others
should
be
extended
to
hers
the
judicial
system
of
the
united
states
exists
in
all
its
efficiency
in
only
fifteen
members
of
the
union
to
three
others
the
circuit
courts
which
constitute
an
important
part
of
that
system
have
been
imperfectly
extended
and
to
the
remaining
six
altogether
denied
the
effect
has
been
to
withhold
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
latter
the
advantages
afforded
by
the
supreme
court
to
their
fellow
citizens
in
other
states
in
the
whole
extent
of
the
criminal
and
much
of
the
civil
authority
of
the
federal
judiciary
that
this
state
of
things
ought
to
be
remedied
if
it
can
be
done
consistently
with
the
public
welfare
is
not
to
be
doubted
neither
is
it
to
be
disguised
that
the
organization
of
our
judicial
system
is
at
once
a
difficult
and
delicate
task
to
extend
the
circuit
courts
equally
throughout
the
different
parts
of
the
union
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
such
a
multiplication
of
members
as
would
encumber
the
supreme
appellate
tribunal
is
the
object
desired
perhaps
it
might
be
accomplished
by
dividing
the
circuit
judges
into
two
classes
and
providing
that
the
supreme
court
should
be
held
by
these
classes
alternately
the
chief
justice
always
presiding
if
an
extension
of
the
circuit
court
system
to
those
states
which
do
not
now
enjoy
its
benefits
should
be
determined
upon
it
would
of
course
be
necessary
to
revise
the
present
arrangement
of
the
circuits
and
even
if
that
system
should
not
be
enlarged
such
a
revision
is
recommended
a
provision
for
taking
the
census
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
will
to
insure
the
completion
of
that
work
within
a
convenient
time
claim
the
early
attention
of
congress
the
great
and
constant
increase
of
business
in
the
department
of
state
forced
itself
at
an
early
period
upon
the
attention
of
the
executive
thirteen
years
ago
it
was
in
mr
madisons
last
message
to
congress
made
the
subject
of
an
earnest
recommendation
which
has
been
repeated
by
both
of
his
successors
and
my
comparatively
limited
experience
has
satisfied
me
of
its
justness
it
has
arisen
from
many
causes
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
large
addition
that
has
been
made
to
the
family
of
independent
nations
and
the
proportionate
extension
of
our
foreign
relations
the
remedy
proposed
was
the
establishment
of
a
home
departmenta
measure
which
does
not
appear
to
have
met
the
views
of
congress
on
account
of
its
supposed
tendency
to
increase
gradually
and
imperceptibly
the
already
too
strong
bias
of
the
federal
system
toward
the
exercise
of
authority
not
delegated
to
it
i
am
not
therefore
disposed
to
revive
the
recommendation
but
am
not
the
less
impressed
with
the
importance
of
so
organizing
that
department
that
its
secretary
may
devote
more
of
his
time
to
our
foreign
relations
clearly
satisfied
that
the
public
good
would
be
promoted
by
some
suitable
provision
on
the
subject
i
respectfully
invite
your
attention
to
it
the
charter
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states
expires
in
and
its
stock
holders
will
most
probably
apply
for
a
renewal
of
their
privileges
in
order
to
avoid
the
evils
resulting
from
precipitancy
in
a
measure
involving
such
important
principles
and
such
deep
pecuniary
interests
i
feel
that
i
can
not
in
justice
to
the
parties
interested
too
soon
present
it
to
the
deliberate
consideration
of
the
legislature
and
the
people
both
the
constitutionality
and
the
expediency
of
the
law
creating
this
bank
are
well
questioned
by
a
large
portion
of
our
fellow
citizens
and
it
must
be
admitted
by
all
that
it
has
failed
in
the
great
end
of
establishing
an
uniform
and
sound
currency
under
these
circumstances
if
such
an
institution
is
deemed
essential
to
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
i

submit
to
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature
whether
a
national
one
founded
upon
the
credit
of
the
government
and
its
revenues
might
not
be
devised
which
would
avoid
all
constitutional
difficulties
and
at
the
same
time
secure
all
the
advantages
to
the
government
and
country
that
were
expected
to
result
from
the
present
bank
i
can
not
close
this
communication
without
bringing
to
your
view
the
just
claim
of
the
representatives
of
commodore
decatur
his
officers
and
crew
arising
from
the
recapture
of
the
frigate
philadelphia
under
the
heavy
batteries
of
tripoli
although
sensible
as
a
general
rule
of
the
impropriety
of
executive
interference
under
a
government
like
ours
where
every
individual
enjoys
the
right
of
directly
petitioning
congress
yet
viewing
this
case
as
one
of
very
peculiar
character
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
recommend
it
to
your
favorable
consideration
besides
the
justice
of
this
claim
as
corresponding
to
those
which
have
been
since
recognized
and
satisfied
it
is
the
fruit
of
a
deed
of
patriotic
and
chivalrous
daring
which
infused
life
and
confidence
into
our
infant
navy
and
contributed
as
much
as
any
exploit
in
its
history
to
elevate
our
national
character
public
gratitude
therefore
stamps
her
seal
upon
it
and
the
meed
should
not
be
withheld
which
may
here
after
operate
as
a
stimulus
to
our
gallant
tars
i
now
commend
you
fellow
citizens
to
the
guidance
of
almighty
god
with
a
full
reliance
on
his
merciful
providence
for
the
maintenance
of
our
free
institutions
and
with
an
earnest
supplication
that
what
ever
errors
it
may
be
my
lot
to
commit
in
discharging
the
arduous
duties
which
have
devolved
on
me
will
find
a
remedy
in
the
harmony
and
wisdom
of
your
counsels
