mr
speaker
mr
president
distinguished
members
of
congress
honored
guests
and
fellow
citizens
i
mean
to
speak
tonight
of
big
things
of
big
changes
and
the
promises
they
hold
and
of
some
big
problems
and
how
together
we
can
solve
them
and
move
our
country
forward
as
the
undisputed
leader
of
the
age
we
gather
tonight
at
a
dramatic
and
deeply
promising
time
in
our
history
and
in
the
history
of
man
on
earth
for
in
the
past
months
the
world
has
known
changes
of
almost
biblical
proportions
and
even
now
months
after
the
failed
coup
that
doomed
a
failed
system
i
am
not
sure
we
have
absorbed
the
full
impact
the
full
import
of
what
happened
but
communism
died
this
year
even
as
president
with
the
most
fascinating
possible
vantage
point
there
were
times
when
i
was
so
busy
helping
to
manage
progress
and
lead
change
that
i
didnt
always
show
the
joy
that
was
in
my
heart
but
the
biggest
thing
that
has
happened
in
the
world
in
my
life
in
our
lives
is
this
by
the
grace
of
god
america
won
the
cold
war
and
theres
another
to
be
singled
out
though
it
may
seem
inelegant
i
mean
a
mass
of
people
called
the
american
taxpayer
no
ever
thinks
to
thank
the
people
who
pay
countrys
bill
or
an
alliances
bill
but
for
a
half
century
now
the
american
people
have
shouldered
the
burden
and
paid
taxes
that
were
higher
than
they
would
have
been
to
support
a
defense
that
was
bigger
than
it
would
have
been
if
imperial
communism
had
never
existed
but
it
did
but
it
doesnt
anymore
and
here
is
a
fact
i
wouldnt
mind
the
world
acknowledging
the
american
taxpayer
bore
the
brunt
of
the
burden
and
deserves
a
hunk
of
the
glory
and
so
now
for
the
first
time
in
years
our
strategic
bombers
stand
down
no
longer
are
they
on
roundtheclock
alert
tomorrow
our
children
will
go
to
school
and
study
history
and
how
plants
grow
and
they
wont
have
as
my
children
did
airraid
drills
in
which
they
crawl
under
their
desks
and
cover
their
heads
in
case
of
nuclear
war
my
grandchildren
dont
have
to
do
that
and
wont
have
the
bad
dreams
children
once
had
in
decades
past
there
are
still
threats
but
the
long
drawnout
dread
is
over
a
year
ago
tonight
i
spoke
to
you
at
a
moment
of
high
peril
american
forces
had
just
unleashed
operation
desert
storm
and
after
days
in
the
desert
skies
and
days
on
the
ground
the
men
and
women
of
americas
armed
forces
and
our
allies
accomplished
the
goals
that
i
declared
and
that
you
endorsed
we
liberated
kuwait
soon
after
the
arab
world
and
israel
sat
down
to
talk
seriously
and
comprehensively
about
peace
an
historic
first
and
soon
after
that
at
christmas
the
last
american
hostages
came
home
our
policies
were
vindicated
much
good
can
come
from
the
prudent
use
of
power
and
much
good
can
come
from
this
a
world
once
divided
into
two
armed
camps
now
recognizes
one
sole
and
preeminent
power
the
united
states
of
america
and
this
they
regard
with
no
dread
for
the
world
trusts
us
with
power
and
the
world
is
right
they
trust
us
to
be
fair
and
restrained
they
trust
us
to
be
on
the
side
of
decency
they
trust
us
to
do
whats
right
i
use
those
words
advisedly
a
few
days
after
the
war
began
i
received
a
telegram
from
joanne
speicher
the
wife
of
the
first
pilot
killed
in
the
gulf
lieutenant
commander
scott
speicher
even
in
her
grief
she
wanted
me
to
know
that
some
day
when
her
children
were
old
enough
she
would
tell
them
that
their
father
went
away
to
war
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
she
said
it
all
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
we
did
it
together
there
were
honest
differences
here
in
this
chamber
but
when
the
war
began
you
put
your
partisanship
aside
and
supported
our
troops
this
is
still
a
time
for
pride
but
this
is
no
time
to
boast
for
problems
face
us
and
we
must
stand
together
once
again
and
solve
themand
not
let
our
country
down
two
years
ago
i
began
planning
cuts
in
military
spending
that
reflected
the
changes
of
the
new
era
but
now
this
year
with
imperial
communism
gone
that
process
can
be
accelerated
tonight
i
can
tell
you
of
dramatic
changes
in
our
strategic
nuclear
force
these
are
actions
we
are
taking
on
our
own
because
they
are
the
right
thing
to
do
after
completing
planes
for
which
we
have
begun
procurement
we
will
shut
down
production
of
the
b
bomber
we
will
cancel
the
icbm
program
we
will
cease
production
of
new
warheads
for
our
seabased
missiles
we
will
stop
all
production
of
the
peacekeeper
missile
and
we
will
not
purchase
any
more
advanced
cruise
missiles
this
weekend
i
will
meet
at
camp
david
with
boris
yeltsin
of
the
russian
federation
i
have
informed
president
yeltsin
that
if
the
commonwealth
the
former
soviet
union
will
eliminate
all
landbased
multiplewarhead
ballistic
missiles
i
will
do
the
following
we
will
eliminate
all
peacekeeper
missiles
we
will
reduce
the
number
of
warheads
on
minuteman
missiles
to
one
and
reduce
the
number
of
warheads
on
our
seabased
missiles
by
about
onethird
and
we
will
convert
a
substantial
portion
of
our
strategic
to
primarily
conventional
use
president
yeltsins
early
response
has
been
very
positive
and
i
expect
our
talks
at
camp
david
to
be
fruitful
i
want
you
to
know
that
for
half
a
century
american
presidents
have
longed
to
make
such
decisions
and
say
such
words
but
even
in
the
midst
of
celebration
we
must
keep
caution
as
a
friend
for
the
world
is
still
a
dangerous
place
only
the
dead
have
seen
the
end
of
conflict
and
though
yesterdays
challenges
are
behind
us
tomorrows
are
being
born
the
secretary
of
defense
recommended
these
cuts
after
consultation
with
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
and
i
make
them
with
confidence
but
do
not
misunderstand
me
the
reductions
i
have
approved
will
save
us
an
additional
billion
over
the
next
five
years
by
we
will
have
cut
defense
by
percent
since
i
took
office
these
cuts
are
deep
and
you
must
know
my
resolve
this
deep
and
no
deeper
to
do
less
would
be
insensible
to
progress
but
to
do
more
would
be
ignorant
of
history
we
must
not
go
back
to
the
days
of
the
hollow
army
we
cannot
repeat
the
mistakes
made
twice
in
this
century
when
armistice
was
followed
by
recklessness
and
defense
was
purged
as
if
the
world
was
permanently
safe
i
remind
you
this
evening
that
i
have
asked
for
your
support
in
funding
a
program
to
protect
our
country
from
limited
nuclear
missile
attack
we
must
have
this
protection
because
too
many
people
in
too
many
countries
have
access
to
nuclear
arms
there
are
those
who
say
that
now
we
can
turn
away
from
the
world
that
we
have
no
special
role
no
special
place
but
we
are
the
united
states
of
america
the
leader
of
the
west
that
has
become
the
leader
of
the
world
as
long
as
i
am
president
we
will
continue
to
lead
in
support
of
freedom
everywhere
not
out
of
arrogance
and
not
out
of
altruism
but
for
the
safety
and
security
of
our
children
this
is
a
fact
strength
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
is
no
vice
isolationism
in
the
pursuit
of
security
is
no
virtue
now
to
our
troubles
at
home
they
are
not
all
economic
but
the
primary
problem
is
our
economy
there
are
some
good
signs
inflation
that
thief
is
down
and
interest
rates
are
down
but
unemployment
is
too
high
some
industries
are
in
trouble
and
growth
is
not
what
it
should
be
let
me
tell
you
right
from
the
start
and
right
from
the
heart
i
know
were
in
hard
times
but
i
know
something
else
this
will
not
stand
my
friends
in
this
chamber
we
can
bring
the
same
courage
and
sense
of
common
purpose
to
the
economy
that
we
brought
to
desert
storm
and
we
can
defeat
hard
times
together
i
believe
you
will
help
one
reason
is
that
youre
patriots
and
you
want
the
best
for
your
country
and
i
believe
that
in
your
hearts
you
want
to
put
partisanship
aside
and
get
the
job
done
because
its
the
right
thing
to
do
the
power
of
america
rests
in
a
stirring
but
simple
idea
that
people
will
do
great
things
if
only
you
set
them
free
well
were
going
to
have
to
set
the
economy
free
for
if
this
age
of
miracles
and
wonders
has
taught
us
anything
its
that
if
we
can
change
the
world
we
can
change
america
we
must
encourage
investment
we
must
make
it
easier
for
people
to
invest
money
and
make
new
products
new
industries
and
new
jobs
we
must
clear
away
obstacles
to
new
growth
high
taxes
high
regulation
red
tape
and
yes
wasteful
government
spending
none
of
this
will
happen
with
a
snap
of
the
fingers
but
it
will
happen
and
the
test
of
a
plan
isnt
whether
its
called
new
or
dazzling
the
american
people
arent
impressed
by
gimmicks
theyre
smarter
on
this
score
than
all
of
us
in
this
room
the
only
test
of
a
plan
is
it
is
sound
and
will
it
work
we
must
have
a
shortterm
plan
to
address
our
immediate
needs
and
heat
up
the
economy
and
then
we
need
a
longterm
plan
to
keep
the
combustion
going
and
to
guarantee
our
place
in
the
world
economy
there
are
certain
things
that
a
president
can
do
without
congress
and
i
am
going
to
do
them
i
have
this
evening
asked
major
cabinet
departments
and
federal
agencies
to
institute
a
day
moratorium
on
any
new
federal
regulations
that
could
hinder
growth
in
those
days
major
departments
and
agencies
will
carry
out
a
toptobottom
review
of
all
regulations
old
and
new
to
stop
the
ones
that
will
hurt
growth
and
speed
up
those
that
will
help
growth
further
for
the
untold
number
of
hardworking
responsible
american
workers
and
businessmen
and
women
whove
been
forced
to
go
without
needed
bank
loans
the
banking
credit
crunch
must
end
i
wont
neglect
my
responsibility
for
sound
regulations
that
serve
the
public
good
but
regulatory
overkill
must
be
stopped
and
i
have
instructed
our
government
regulators
to
stop
it
i
have
directed
cabinet
departments
and
federal
agencies
to
speed
up
progrowth
expenditures
as
quickly
as
possible
this
should
put
an
extra
billion
into
the
economy
in
the
next
six
months
and
our
new
transportation
bill
provides
more
than
billion
for
construction
and
maintenance
projects
that
are
vital
to
our
growth
and
wellbeing
that
means
jobs
building
roads
jobs
building
bridges
and
jobs
building
railways
and
i
have
this
evening
directed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
change
the
federal
tax
withholding
tables
with
this
change
millions
of
americans

from
whom
the
government
withholds
more
than
necessary
can
now
choose
to
have
the
government
withhold
less
from
their
paychecks
something
tells
me
a
number
of
taxpayers
may
take
us
up
on
this
one
this
initiative
could
return
about
billion
back
into
the
economy
over
the
next
months
money
people
can
use
to
help
pay
for
clothing
college
or
a
new
car
and
finally
working
with
the
federal
reserve
we
will
continue
to
support
monetary
policy
that
keeps
both
interest
rates
and
inflation
down
now
these
are
the
things
that
i
can
do
and
now
members
of
congress
let
me
tell
you
what
you
can
do
for
your
country
you
must
you
must
pass
the
other
elements
of
my
plan
to
meet
our
economic
needs
everyone
knows
investment
speeds
recovery
and
i
am
proposing
this
evening
a
change
in
the
alternative
minimum
tax
and
the
creation
of
a
new
investment
tax
allowance
this
will
encourage
businesses
to
accelerate
investment
and
bring
people
back
to
work
real
estate
has
led
our
economy
out
of
almost
all
the
tough
times
weve
ever
had
once
building
starts
carpenters
and
plumbers
work
people
buy
homes
and
take
out
mortgages
my
plan
would
modify
the
passiveloss
rule
for
active
realestate
developers
and
it
would
make
it
easier
for
pension
plans
to
purchase
real
estate
for
those
americans
who
dream
of
buying
a
first
home
but
who
cant
quite
afford
it
my
plan
would
allow
firsttime
home
buyers
to
withdraw
savings
from
iras
without
penalty
and
provide
a
tax
credit
for
the
first
purchase
of
that
home
and
finally
my
immediate
plan
calls
on
congress
to
give
crucial
help
to
people
who
own
a
home
to
every
one
who
has
a
business
a
farm
or
a
single
investment
this
time
at
this
hour
i
cannot
take
no
for
an
answer
you
must
cut
the
capital
gains
tax
on
the
people
of
this
country
never
has
an
issue
been
so
demagogued
by
its
opponents
but
the
demagogues
are
wrong
they
are
wrong
and
they
know
it
sixty
percent
of
people
who
benefit
from
lower
capital
gains
have
incomes
under
a
cut
in
the
capital
gains
tax
increases
jobs
and
helps
just
about
everyone
in
our
country
and
so
im
asking
you
to
cut
the
capital
gains
tax
to
a
maximum
of
and
ill
tell
you
ill
tell
you
those
of
you
who
say
oh
no
someone
whos
comfortable
may
benefit
from
this
you
kind
of
remind
me
of
the
old
definition
of
the
puritan
who
couldnt
sleep
at
night
worrying
that
somehow
someone
somewhere
was
out
having
a
good
time
the
opponents
of
this
measure
and
those
whove
authored
various
socalled
soaktherich
bills
that
are
floating
around
this
chamber
should
be
reminded
of
something
when
they
aim
at
the
big
guy
they
usually
hit
the
little
guy
and
maybe
its
time
that
stopped
this
then
is
my
shortterm
plan
your
part
members
of
congress
requires
enactment
of
these
commonsense
proposals
that
will
have
a
strong
effect
on
the
economy
without
breaking
the
budget
agreement
and
without
raising
tax
rates
and
while
my
plan
is
being
passed
and
kicking
in
weve
got
to
care
for
those
in
trouble
today
i
have
provided
for
up
to
billion
in
my
budget
to
extend
federal
unemployment
benefits
and
i
ask
for
congressional
action
right
away
and
i
thank
the
committeewell
at
last
and
lets
be
frank
lets
be
frank
let
me
level
with
you
i
know
and
you
know
that
my
plan
is
unveiled
in
a
political
season
i
know
and
you
know
that
everything
i
propose
will
be
viewed
by
some
in
merely
partisan
terms
but
i
ask
you
to
know
what
is
in
my
heart
and
my
aim
is
to
increase
our
nations
good
and
im
doing
what
i
think
is
right
im
proposing
what
i
know
will
help
i
pride
myself
that
im
a
prudent
man
and
i
believe
that
patience
is
a
virtue
but
i
understand
politics
is
for
some
a
game
and
that
sometimes
the
game
is
to
stop
all
progress
and
then
decry
the
lack
of
improvement
but
let
me
tell
you
let
me
tell
you
far
more
important
than
my
political
futureand
far
more
important
than
yoursis
the
wellbeing
of
our
country
and
members
of
this
chamber
members
of
this
chamber
are
practical
people
and
i
know
you
wont
resent
some
practical
advice
when
people
put
their
partys
fortunes
whatever
the
party
whatever
the
side
of
this
aisle
before
the
public
good
they
court
defeat
not
only
for
their
country
but
for
themselves
and
they
will
certainly
deserve
it
and
i
submit
my
plan
tomorrow
and
i
am
asking
you
to
pass
it
by
march
from
the
day
after
thatif
it
must
bethe
battle
is
joined
and
you
know
when
principle
is
at
stake
i
relish
a
good
fair
fight
i
said
my
plan
has
two
parts
and
it
does
and
its
the
second
part
that
is
the
heart
of
the
matter
for
its
not
enough
to
get
an
immediate
burst
we
need
longterm
improvement
in
our
economic
position
we
all
know
that
the
key
to
our
economic
future
is
to
insure
that
america
continues
as
the
economic
leader
of
the
world
we
have
that
in
our
power
here
then
is
my
longterm
plan
to
guarantee
our
future
first
trade
we
will
work
to
break
down
the
walls
that
stop
world
trade
we
will
work
to
open
markets
everywhere
and
in
our
major
trade
negotiations
i
will
continue
pushing
to
eliminate
tariffs
and
subsidies
that
damage
americas
farmers
and
workers
and
well
get
more
good
american
jobs
within
our
own
hemisphere
through
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
and
through
the
enterprise
for
the
americas
initiative
but
changes
are
here
and
more
are
coming
the
work
place
of
the
future
will
demand
more
highly
skilled
workers
than
ever
people
who
are
computer
literate
highly
educated
and
we
must
be
the
worlds
leader
in
education
and
we
must
revolutionize
americas
schools
my
america
strategy
will
help
us
reach
that
goal
my
plan
will
give
parents
more
choice
give
teachers
more
flexibility
and
help
communities
create
new
american
schools
thirty
states
across
the
nation
have
established
america
programs
hundreds
of
cities
and
towns
have
joined
now
congress
must
join
this
great
movement
pass
my
proposals
for
new
american
schools
that
was
my
second
longterm
proposal
and
heres
my
third
we
must
make
commonsense
investments
that
will
help
us
compete
longterm
in
the
marketplace
we
must
encourage
research
and
development
my
plan
is
to
make
the
r
and
d
tax
credit
permanent
and
to
provide
record
levels
of
support
over
billion
this
year
alone
for
people
who
explore
the
promise
of
emerging
technologies
and
fourth
we
must
do
something
about
crime
and
drugs
and
it
is
time
for
a
major
renewed
investment
in
fighting
violent
street
crime
its
saps
our
strength
and
hurts
our
faith
in
our
society
and
in
our
future
together
surely
a
tired
woman
on
her
way
to
work
at
six
in
the
morning
on
a
subway
deserves
the
right
to
get
there
safely
and
surely
its
true
that
everyone
who
changes
his
or
her
way
of
life
because
of
crimefrom
those
afraid
to
go
our
at
night
to
those
afraid
to
walk
in
the
parks
they
pay
forsurely
those
people
have
been
denied
a
basic
civil
right
it
is
time
to
restore
it
congress
pass
my
comprehensive
crime
bill
it
is
tough
on
criminals
and
supportive
of
police
and
it
has
been
languishing
in
these
hallowed
halls
for
years
now
pass
it
help
your
country
and
fifth
i
ask
you
tonight
to
fund
our
hope
housing
proposal
and
to
pass
my
enterprisezone
legislation
which
will
get
businesses
into
the
inner
city
we
must
empower
the
poor
with
the
pride
that
comes
from
owning
a
home
getting
a
job
becoming
part
of
things
my
plan
would
encourage
real
estate
construction
by
extending
tax
incentives
for
mortgagerevenue
bonds
and
lowincome
housing
and
i
ask
tonight
for
record
expenditures
for
the
program
that
helps
children
born
into
want
move
into
excellence
head
start
step
six
we
must
reform
our
health
care
system
for
this
too
bears
on
whether
or
not
we
can
compete
in
the
world
american
health
costs
have
been
exploding
this
year
america
will
spend
over
billion
on
health
and
that
is
expected
to
grow
to
trillion
by
the
end
of
the
decade
we
simply
cannot
afford
this
the
cost
of
health
care
shows
up
not
only
in
your
family
budget
but
in
the
price
of
everything
we
buy
and
everything
we
sell
when
health
coverage
for
a
fellow
on
the
assembly
line
costs
thousands
of
dollars
the
cost
goes
into
the
product
he
makes
and
you
pay
the
bill
now
we
must
make
a
choice
now
some
pretend
we
can
have
it
both
ways
they
call
it
play
or
pay
but
that
expensive
approach
is
unstable
it
will
mean
higher
taxes
fewer
jobs
and
eventually
a
system
under
complete
government
control
really
there
are
only
two
options
and
we
can
move
toward
a
nationalized
system
a
system
which
will
restrict
patient
choice
in
picking
a
doctor
and
force
the
government
to
ration
services
arbitrarily
and
what
well
get
is
patients
in
long
lines
indifferent
service
and
a
huge
new
tax
burden
or
we
can
reform
our
own
private
healthcare
system
which
still
gives
us
for
all
its
flaws
the
best
quality
health
care
in
the
world
well
lets
build
on
our
strengths
my
plan
provides
insurance
security
for
all
americans
while
preserving
and
increasing
the
idea
of
choice
we
make
basic
health
insurance
affordable
for
all
lowincome
people
not
now
covered
we
do
it
by
providing
a
healthinsurance
tax
credit
of
up
to
for
each
lowincome
family
the
middle
class
gets
help
too
and
by
reforming
the
health
insurance
market
my
plan
assures
that
americans
will
have
access
to
basic
health
insurance
even
if
they
change
jobs
or
develop
serious
health
problem
we
must
bring
costs
under
control
preserve
quality
preserve
choice
and
reduce
peoples
nagging
daily
worry
about
health
insurance
my
plan
the
details
of
which
i
will
announce
shortly
does
just
that
and
seventh
we
must
get
the
federal
deficit
under
control
we
now
have
in
law
enforcable
spending
caps
and
a
requirement
that
we
pay
for
the
programs
we
create
there
are
those
in
congress
who
would
ease
that
discipline
now
but
i
cannot
let
them
do
it
and
i
wont
my
plan
would
freeze
all
domestic
discretionary
budget
authority
which
means
no
more
next
year
than
this
year
i
will
not
tamper
with
social
security
but
i
would
put
real
caps
on
the
growth
of
uncontrolled
spending
and
i
would
also
freeze
federal
domestic
government
employment
and
with
the
help
of
congress
my
plan
will
get
rid
of
programs
that
dont
deserve
federal
fundin
g
some
of
them
have
noble
titles
but
none
of
them
is
indispensible
we
can
get
rid
of
each
and
every
one
of
them
you
know
its
time
we
rediscovered
a
home
truth
the
american
people
have
never
forgotten
the
government
is
too
big
and
spends
too
much
and
i
call
on
congress
to
adopt
a
measure
that
will
help
put
an
end
to
the
annual
ritual
of
filling
the
budget
with
porkbarrel
appropriations
every
year
the
press
has
a
field
day
making
fun
of
outrageous
examples
a
lawrence
welk
museum
a
research
grant
for
belgian
endive
we
all
know
how
these
things
get
into
the
budget
and
maybe
you
need
someone
to
help
you
say
no
i
know
how
to
say
it
and
you
know
what
i
need
to
make
it
stick
give
me
the
same
thing
governors
havethe
lineitem
vetoand
let
me
help
you
control
spending
we
must
put
an
end
to
unfinanced
government
mandates
these
are
the
requirements
congress
puts
on
our
cities
counties
and
states
without
supplying
the
money
and
if
congress
passes
a
mandate
it
should
be
forced
to
pay
for
it
and
balance
the
cost
with
savings
elsewhere
after
all
a
mandate
just
increases
someone
elses
tax
burden
and
that
means
higher
taxes
at
the
state
and
local
level
step
eight
congress
should
enact
the
bold
reform
proposals
that
are
still
awaiting
congressional
action
bank
reform
civil
justice
reform
tort
reform
and
my
national
energy
strategy
and
finally
we
must
strengthen
the
family
because
it
is
the
family
that
has
the
greatest
bearing
on
our
future
when
barbara
holds
an
aids
baby
in
her
arms
and
reads
to
children
shes
saying
to
every
person
in
this
country
family
matters
and
i
am
announcing
tonight
a
new
commission
on
americas
urban
families
ive
asked
missouris
governor
john
ashcroft
to
be
chairman
former
dallas
mayor
annetter
strauss
to
be
cochair
you
know
i
had
mayors
the
leading
mayors
from
the
league
of
cities
in
the
other
day
at
the
white
house
and
they
told
me
something
striking
they
said
that
every
one
of
them
republican
and
democrat
agreed
on
one
thing
that
the
major
cause
of
the
problems
of
the
cities
is
the
dissolution
of
the
family
and
they
asked
for
this
commission
and
they
were
right
to
ask
because
its
time
to
determine
what
we
can
do
to
keep
families
together
strong
and
sound
theres
one
thing
we
can
do
right
away
ease
the
burden
of
rearing
a
child
i
ask
you
tonight
to
raise
the
personal
exemption
by
per
child
for
every
family
for
a
family
with
four
kids
thats
an
increase
of
this
is
a
good
start
in
the
right
direction
and
its
what
we
can
afford
its
time
to
allow
families
to
deduct
the
interest
they
pay
on
student
loans
and
im
asking
you
to
do
just
that
and
im
asking
you
to
allow
people
to
use
money
from
their
iras
to
pay
medical
and
educational
expenses
all
without
penalties
and
im
asking
for
more
ask
american
parents
what
they
dislike
about
how
things
are
going
in
our
country
and
chances
are
good
that
pretty
soon
theyll
get
to
welfare
americans
are
the
most
generous
people
on
earth
but
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
insight
of
franklin
roosevelt
who
when
he
spoke
of
what
became
the
welfare
program
want
that
it
must
not
become
a
narcotic
and
a
subtle
destroyer
of
the
spirit
welfare
was
never
meant
to
be
a
life
style
it
was
never
meant
to
be
a
habit
it
was
never
supposed
to
be
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
like
a
legacy
its
time
to
replace
the
assumptions
of
the
welfare
state
and
help
reform
the
welfare
system
states
throughout
the
country
are
beginning
to
operate
with
new
assumptions
that
when
ablebodied
people
receive
government
assistance
they
have
responsibilities
to
the
taxpayer
a
responsibility
to
seek
work
education
or
job
training
a
responsibility
to
get
their
lives
in
order
a
responsibility
to
hold
their
families
together
and
refrain
from
having
children
out
of
wedlock
and
a
responsibility
to
obey
the
law
we
are
going
to
help
this
movement
often
state
reform
requires
waiving
certain
federal
regulations
i
will
act
to
make
that
process
easier
and
quicker
for
every
state
that
asks
our
help
and
i
want
to
add
as
we
make
these
changes
we
work
together
to
improve
this
system
that
our
intention
is
not
scapegoating
and
fingerpointing
if
you
read
the
papers
or
watch
tv
you
know
theres
been
a
rise
these
days
in
a
certain
kind
of
ugliness
racist
comments
antisemitism
an
increased
sense
of
division
really
this
is
not
us
this
is
not
who
we
are
and
this
is
not
acceptable
and
so
you
have
my
plan
for
america
and
i
am
asking
for
big
things
but
i
believe
in
my
heart
you
will
do
whats
right
and
you
know
its
kind
of
an
american
tradition
to
show
a
certain
skepticism
toward
our
democratic
institutions
i
myself
have
sometimes
thought
the
aging
process
could
be
delayed
if
it
had
to
make
its
way
through
congress
but
you
will
deliberate
and
you
will
discuss
and
that
is
fine
but
my
friends
the
people
cannot
wait
they
need
help
now
and
theres
a
mood
among
us
people
are
worried
there
has
been
talk
of
decline
someone
even
said
our
workers
are
lazy
and
uninspired
and
i
thought
really
go
tell
neil
armstrong
standing
on
the
moon
tell
the
american
farmer
who
feeds
his
country
and
the
world
tell
the
men
and
women
of
desert
storm
moods
come
and
go
but
greatness
endures
our
does
and
maybe
for
a
moment
its
good
to
remember
what
in
the
dailyness
of
our
lives
we
forget
we
are
still
and
ever
the
freest
nation
on
earth
the
kindest
nation
on
earth
the
strongest
nation
on
earth
and
we
have
always
risen
to
the
occasion
and
we
are
going
to
lift
this
nation
out
of
hard
times
inch
by
inch
and
day
by
day
and
those
who
would
stop
us
better
step
aside
because
i
look
at
hard
times
and
i
make
this
vow
this
will
not
stand
and
so
we
move
on
together
a
rising
nation
the
once
and
future
miracle
that
is
still
this
night
the
hope
of
the
world

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
united
states
congress
i
come
to
this
house
of
the
people
to
speak
to
you
and
all
americans
certain
we
stand
at
a
defining
hour
halfway
around
the
world
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
struggle
in
the
skies
and
on
the
seas
and
sands
we
know
why
were
there
we
are
americanspart
of
something
larger
than
ourselves
for
two
centuries
weve
done
the
hard
work
of
freedom
and
tonight
we
lead
the
world
in
facing
down
a
threat
to
decency
and
humanity
what
is
at
stake
is
more
than
one
small
country
it
is
a
big
ideaa
new
world
order
where
diverse
nations
are
drawn
together
in
common
cause
to
achieve
the
universal
aspirations
of
mankind
peace
and
security
freedom
and
the
rule
of
law
such
is
a
world
worthy
of
our
struggle
and
worthy
of
our
childrens
future
the
community
of
nations
has
resolutely
gathered
to
condemn
and
repel
lawless
aggression
saddam
husseins
unprovoked
invasionhis
ruthless
systematic
rape
of
a
peaceful
neighborviolated
everything
the
community
of
nations
holds
dear
the
world
has
said
this
aggression
would
not
stand
and
it
will
not
stand
together
we
have
resisted
the
trap
of
appeasement
cynicism
and
isolation
that
gives
temptation
to
tyrants
the
world
has
answered
saddams
invasion
with
united
nations
resolutions
starting
with
a
demand
for
iraqs
immediate
and
unconditional
withdrawal
and
backed
up
by
forces
from
countries
of
six
continents
with
few
exceptions
the
world
now
stands
as
one
the
end
of
the
cold
war
has
been
a
victory
for
all
humanity
a
year
and
a
half
ago
in
germany
i
said
our
goal
was
a
europe
whole
and
free
tonight
germany
is
united
europe
has
become
whole
and
free
and
americas
leadership
was
instrumental
in
making
it
possible
the
principle
that
has
guided
us
is
simple
our
objective
is
to
help
the
baltic
peoples
achieve
their
aspirations
not
to
punish
the
soviet
union
in
our
recent
discussions
with
the
soviet
leadership
we
have
been
given
representations
which
if
fulfilled
would
result
in
the
withdrawal
of
some
soviet
forces
a
reopening
of
dialogue
with
the
republics
and
a
move
away
from
violence
we
will
watch
carefully
as
the
situation
develops
and
we
will
maintain
our
contact
with
the
soviet
leadership
to
encourage
continued
commitment
to
democratization
and
reform
if
it
is
possible
i
want
to
continue
to
build
a
lasting
basis
for
ussoviet
cooperation
for
a
more
peaceful
future
for
all
mankind
the
triumph
of
democratic
ideas
in
eastern
europe
and
latin
america
and
the
continuing
struggle
for
freedom
elsewhere
around
the
world
all
confirm
the
wisdom
of
our
nations
founders
tonight
we
work
to
achieve
another
victory
a
victory
over
tyranny
and
savage
aggression
we
in
this
union
enter
the
last
decade
of
the
th
century
thankful
for
all
our
blessings
steadfast
in
our
purpose
aware
of
our
difficulties
and
responsive
to
our
duties
at
home
and
around
the
world
for
two
centuries
america
has
served
the
world
as
an
inspiring
example
of
freedom
and
democracy
for
generations
america
has
led
the
struggle
to
preserve
and
extend
the
blessings
of
liberty
and
today
in
a
rapidly
changing
world
american
leadership
is
indispensable
americans
know
that
leadership
brings
burdens
and
requires
sacrifice
but
we
also
know
why
the
hopes
of
humanity
turn
to
us
we
are
americans
we
have
a
unique
responsibility
to
do
the
hard
work
of
freedom
and
when
we
do
freedom
works
the
conviction
and
courage
we
see
in
the
persian
gulf
today
is
simply
the
american
character
in
action
the
indomitable
spirit
that
is
contributing
to
this
victory
for
world
peace
and
justice
is
the
same
spirit
that
gives
us
the
power
and
the
potential
to
meet
our
challenges
at
home
we
are
resolute
and
resourceful
if
we
can
selflessly
confront
evil
for
the
sake
of
good
in
a
land
so
far
away
then
surely
we
can
make
this
land
all
it
should
be
if
anyone
tells
you
americas
best
days
are
behind
her
theyre
looking
the
wrong
way
tonight
i
come
before
this
house
and
the
american
people
with
an
appeal
for
renewal
this
is
not
merely
a
call
for
new
government
initiatives
it
is
a
call
for
new
initiative
in
government
in
our
communities
and
from
every
americanto
prepare
for
the
next
american
century
america
has
always
led
by
example
so
who
among
us
will
set
this
example
which
of
our
citizens
will
lead
us
in
this
next
american
century
everyone
who
steps
forward
today
to
get
one
addict
off
drugs
to
convince
one
troubled
teenager
not
to
give
up
on
life
to
comfort
one
aids
patient
to
help
one
hungry
child
we
have
within
our
reach
the
promise
of
renewed
america
we
can
find
meaning
and
reward
by
serving
some
purpose
higher
than
ourselvesa
shining
purpose
the
illumination
of
a
thousand
points
of
light
it
is
expressed
by
all
who
know
the
irresistible
force
of
a
childs
hand
of
a
friend
who
stands
by
you
and
stays
therea
volunteers
generous
gesture
an
idea
that
is
simply
right
the
problems
before
us
may
be
different
but
the
key
to
solving
them
remains
the
same
it
is
the
individualthe
individual
who
steps
forward
and
the
state
of
our
union
is
the
union
of
each
of
us
one
to
the
other
the
sum
of
our
friendships
marriages
families
and
communities
we
all
have
something
to
give
so
if
you
know
how
to
read
find
someone
who
cant
if
youve
got
a
hammer
find
a
nail
if
youre
not
hungry
not
lonely
not
in
troubleseek
out
someone
who
is
join
the
community
of
conscience
do
the
hard
work
of
freedom
that
will
define
the
state
of
our
union
since
the
birth
of
our
nation
we
the
people
has
been
the
source
of
our
strength
what
government
can
do
alone
is
limited
but
the
potential
of
the
american
people
knows
no
limits
we
are
a
nation
of
rocksolid
realism
and
cleareyed
idealism
we
are
americans
we
are
the
nation
that
believes
in
the
future
we
are
the
nation
that
can
shape
the
future
and
weve
begun
to
do
just
that
by
strengthening
the
power
and
choice
of
individuals
and
families
together
these
last
two
years
weve
put
dollars
for
child
care
directly
in
the
hands
of
patients
instead
of
bureaucracies
unshackled
the
potential
of
americans
with
disabilities
applied
the
creativity
of
the
marketplace
in
the
service
of
the
environment
for
clean
air
and
made
homeownership
possible
for
more
americans
the
strength
of
a
democracy
is
not
in
bureaucracy
it
is
in
the
people
and
their
communities
in
everything
we
do
let
us
unleash
the
potential
of
our
most
precious
resourceour
citizens
we
must
return
to
families
communities
counties
cities
states
and
institutions
of
every
kind
the
power
to
chart
their
own
destiny
and
the
freedom
and
opportunity
provided
by
strong
economic
growth
thats
what
america
is
all
about
i
know
tonight
in
some
regions
of
our
country
people
are
in
genuine
economic
distress
i
hear
them
earlier
this
month
kathy
blackwell
of
massachusetts
wrote
me
about
what
can
happen
when
the
economy
slows
down
saying
my
heart
is
aching
and
i
think
that
you
should
knowyour
people
out
here
are
hurting
badly
i
understand
and
im
not
unrealistic
about
the
future
but
there
are
reasons
to
be
optimistic
about
our
economy
first
we
dont
have
to
fight
doubledigit
inflation
second
most
industries
wont
have
to
make
big
cuts
in
production
because
they
dont
have
big
inventories
piled
up
and
third
our
exports
are
running
solid
and
strong
in
fact
american
businesses
are
exporting
at
a
record
rate
so
lets
put
these
times
in
perspective
together
since
weve
created
almost
million
jobs
cut
inflation
in
half
and
cut
interest
rates
in
half
yes
the
largest
peacetime
economic
expansion
in
history
has
been
temporarily
interrupted
but
our
economy
is
still
over
twice
as
large
as
our
closest
competitor
we
will
get
this
recession
behind
us
and
return
to
growth
soon
we
will
get
on
our
way
to
a
new
record
of
expansion
and
achieve
the
competitive
strength
that
will
carry
us
into
the
next
american
century
we
should
focus
our
efforts
today
on
encouraging
economic
growth
investing
in
the
future
and
giving
power
and
opportunity
to
the
individual
we
must
begin
with
control
of
federal
spending
thats
why
im
submitting
a
budget
that
holds
the
growth
in
spending
to
less
than
the
rate
of
inflation
and
thats
why
amid
all
the
sound
and
fury
of
last
years
budget
debate
we
put
into
law
new
enforceable
spending
caps
so
that
future
spending
debates
will
mean
a
battle
of
ideas
not
a
bidding
war
though
controversial
the
budget
agreement
finally
put
the
federal
government
on
a
payasyougo
basis
and
cut
the
growth
of
debt
by
nearly
billion
and
that
frees
funds
for
saving
and
jobcreating
investment
now
lets
do
more
my
budget
again
includes
taxfree
family
savings
accounts
penaltyfree
withdrawals
from
i
r
as
for
firsttime
homebuyers
and
to
increase
jobs
and
growth
a
reduced
tax
for
longterm
capital
gains
i
know
their
are
differences
among
us
about
the
impact
and
the
effects
of
a
capital
gains
incentive
so
tonight
i
am
asking
the
congressional
leaders
and
the
federal
reserve
to
cooperate
with
us
in
a
study
led
by
chairman
alan
greenspan
to
sort
out
our
technical
differences
so
that
we
can
avoid
a
return
to
unproductive
partisan
bickering
but
just
as
our
efforts
will
bring
economic
growth
now
and
in
the
future
they
must
also
be
matched
by
longterm
investments
for
the
next
american
century
that
requires
a
forwardlooking
plan
of
action
and
thats
exactly
what
we
will
be
sending
to
the
congress
we
have
prepared
a
detailed
series
of
proposals
that
include
a
budget
that
promotes
investment
in
americas
futurein
children
education
infrastructure
space
and
high
technology
legislation
to
achieve
excellence
in
education
building
on
the
partnership
forged
with
the
governors
at
the
education
summit
enabling
parents
to
choose
their
childrens
schools
and
helping
to
make
america
no
in
math
and
science
a
blueprint
for
a
new
national
highway
system
a
critical
investment
in
our
transportation
infrastructure
a
research
and
development
agenda
that
includes
record
levels
of
federal
investment
and
a
permanent
tax
credit
to
strengthen
private
r
and
d
and
create
jobs
a
comprehensive
national
energy
strategy
that
calls
for
energy
conservation
and
efficiency
increased
deve
lopment
and
greater
use
of
alternative
fuels
a
banking
reform
plan
to
bring
americas
financial
system
into
the
st
century
so
that
our
banks
remain
safe
and
secure
and
can
continue
to
make
jobcreating
loans
for
our
factories
businesses
and
homebuyers
i
do
think
there
has
been
too
much
pessimism
sound
banks
should
be
making
more
sound
loans
now
and
interest
rates
should
be
lower
now
in
addition
to
these
proposals
we
must
recognize
that
our
economic
strength
depends
upon
being
competitive
in
world
markets
we
must
continue
to
expand
americas
exports
a
successful
uruguay
round
of
world
trade
negotiations
will
create
more
real
jobs
and
more
real
growth
for
all
nations
you
and
i
know
that
if
the
playing
field
is
level
americas
workers
and
farmers
can
outwork
and
outproduce
anyone
anytime
anywhere
and
with
the
mexican
free
trade
agreement
and
our
enterprise
for
the
americas
initiative
we
can
help
our
partners
strengthen
their
economies
and
move
toward
a
free
trade
zone
throughout
this
entire
hemisphere
the
budget
also
includes
a
plan
of
action
right
here
at
home
to
put
more
power
and
opportunity
in
the
hands
of
the
individual
that
means
new
incentives
to
create
jobs
in
our
inner
cities
by
encouraging
investment
through
enterprise
zones
it
also
means
tenant
control
and
ownership
of
public
housing
freedom
and
the
power
to
choose
should
not
be
the
privilege
of
wealth
they
are
the
birthright
of
every
american
civil
rights
are
also
crucial
to
protecting
equal
opportunity
every
one
of
us
has
a
responsibility
to
speak
out
against
racism
bigotry
and
hate
we
will
continue
our
vigorous
enforcement
of
existing
statutes
and
i
will
once
again
press
the
congress
to
strengthen
the
laws
against
employment
discrimination
without
resorting
to
the
use
of
unfair
preferences
were
determined
to
protect
another
fundamental
civil
right
freedom
from
crime
and
the
fear
that
stalks
our
cities
the
attorney
general
will
soon
convene
a
crime
summit
of
the
nations
lawenforcement
officials
and
to
help
us
support
them
we
need
a
tough
crime
control
legislation
and
we
need
it
now
as
we
fight
crime
we
will
fully
implement
our
nation
strategy
for
combatting
drug
abuse
recent
data
show
we
are
making
progress
but
much
remains
to
be
done
we
will
not
rest
until
the
day
of
the
dealer
is
over
forever
good
health
care
is
every
americans
right
and
every
americans
responsibility
so
we
are
proposing
an
aggression
program
of
new
prevention
initiativesfor
infants
for
children
for
adults
and
for
the
elderly
to
promote
a
healthier
america
and
to
help
keep
costs
from
spiraling
its
time
to
give
people
more
choice
in
government
by
reviving
the
ideal
of
the
citizen
politician
who
comes
not
to
stay
but
to
serve
one
of
the
reasons
there
is
so
much
support
for
term
limitations
is
that
the
american
people
are
increasingly
concerned
about
bigmoney
influence
in
politics
we
must
look
beyond
the
next
election
to
the
next
generation
the
time
has
come
to
put
the
national
interest
ahead
of
the
special
interestand
totally
eliminate
political
action
committees
that
would
truly
put
more
competition
in
elections
and
more
power
in
the
hands
of
individuals
and
where
power
cannot
be
put
directly
into
the
hands
of
the
individual
it
should
be
moved
closer
to
the
peopleaway
from
washington
the
federal
government
too
often
treats
government
programs
as
if
they
are
of
washington
by
washington
and
for
washington
once
established
federal
programs
seem
to
become
immortal
its
time
for
a
more
dynamic
program
life
cycle
some
programs
should
increase
some
should
decrease
some
should
be
terminated
and
some
should
be
consolidated
and
turned
over
to
the
states
my
budget
includes
a
list
of
programs
for
potential
turnover
totaling
more
than
billion
working
with
congress
and
the
governors
i
propose
we
select
at
least
billion
in
such
programs
and
turn
them
over
to
the
states
in
a
single
consolidated
grant
fully
funded
for
flexible
management
by
the
states
the
value
of
this
turnover
approach
is
straightforward
it
allows
the
federal
government
to
reduce
overhead
it
allows
states
to
manage
more
flexibly
and
more
efficiently
it
moves
power
and
decisionmaking
closer
to
the
people
and
it
reenforces
a
theme
of
this
administration
appreciation
and
encouragement
of
the
innovative
power
of
states
as
laboratories
this
nation
was
founded
by
leaders
who
understood
that
power
belongs
in
the
hands
of
the
people
they
planned
for
the
future
and
so
must
wehere
and
around
the
world
as
americans
we
know
there
are
times
when
we
must
step
forward
and
accept
our
responsibility
to
lead
the
world
away
from
the
dark
chaos
of
dictators
toward
the
bright
promise
of
a
better
day
almost
years
ago
we
began
a
long
struggle
against
aggressive
totalitarianism
now
we
face
another
defining
hour
for
america
and
the
world
there
is
no
one
more
devoted
more
committed
to
the
hard
work
of
freedom
than
every
soldier
and
sailor
every
marine
airman
and
coastguardsman
every
man
and
every
woman
now
serving
in
the
persian
gulf
each
of
them
has
volunteered
to
provide
for
this
nations
defense
and
now
they
bravely
struggle
to
earn
for
america
and
for
the
world
and
for
future
generations
a
just
and
lasting
peace
our
commitment
to
them
must
be
equal
of
their
commitment
to
our
country
they
are
truly
americas
finest
the
war
in
the
gulf
is
not
a
war
we
wanted
we
worked
hard
to
avoid
war
for
more
than
five
months
we
along
with
the
arab
league
the
european
community
and
the
united
nations
tried
every
diplomatic
avenue
un
secretary
general
perez
de

gorbachev

ozal

and
bendjedid
kings
fahd
and
hassan
prime
ministers
major
and
andreottijust
to
name
a
fewall
worked
for
a
solution
but
time
and
again
saddam
hussein
flatly
rejected
the
path
of
diplomacy
and
peace
the
world
well
knows
how
this
conflict
began
and
when
it
began
on
august
nd
when
saddam
invaded
and
sacked
a
small
defenseless
neighbor
and
i
am
certain
of
how
it
will
end
so
that
peace
can
prevail
we
will
prevail
tonight
im
pleased
to
report
that
we
are
on
course
iraqs
capacity
to
sustain
war
is
being
destroyed
our
investment
our
training
our
planning
all
are
paying
off
time
will
not
be
saddams
salvation
our
purpose
in
the
persian
gulf
remains
constant
to
drive
iraq
out
from
kuwait
to
restore
kuwaits
legitimate
government
and
to
insure
the
stability
and
security
of
this
critical
region
let
me
make
clear
what
i
mean
by
the
regions
stability
and
security
we
do
not
seek
the
destruction
of
iraq
its
culture
or
its
people
rather
we
seek
an
iraq
that
uses
its
great
resources
not
to
destroy
not
to
serve
the
ambitions
of
a
tyrant
but
to
build
a
better
life
for
itself
and
its
neighbors
we
seek
a
persian
gulf
where
conflict
is
no
longer
the
rule
where
the
strong
are
neither
tempted
nor
able
to
intimidate
the
weak
most
americans
know
instinctively
why
we
are
in
the
gulf
they
know
we
had
to
stop
saddam
now
not
later
they
know
this
brutal
dictator
will
do
anything
will
use
any
weapon
will
commit
any
outrage
no
matter
how
many
innocents
must
suffer
they
know
we
must
make
sure
that
control
of
the
worlds
oil
resources
does
not
fall
into
his
hands
only
to
finance
further
aggression
they
know
that
we
need
to
build
a
new
enduring
peacebased
not
on
arms
races
and
confrontation
but
on
shared
principles
and
the
rule
of
law
and
we
all
realize
that
our
responsibility
to
be
the
catalyst
for
peace
in
the
region
does
not
end
with
the
successful
conclusion
of
this
war
democracy
brings
the
undeniable
value
of
thoughtful
dissent
and
we
have
heard
some
dissenting
voices
here
at
home
some
reckless
most
responsible
but
the
fact
the
all
the
voices
have
the
right
to
speak
out
is
one
of
the
reasons
weve
been
united
in
principle
and
purpose
for
years
our
progress
in
this
great
struggle
is
the
result
of
years
of
vigilance
and
a
steadfast
commitment
to
a
strong
defense
now
with
remarkable
technological
advances
like
the
patriot
missile
we
can
defend
the
ballistic
missile
attacks
aimed
at
innocent
civilians
looking
forward
i
have
directed
that
the
sdi
program
be
refocused
on
providing
protection
from
limited
ballistic
missile
strikes
whatever
their
source
let
us
pursue
an
sdi
program
that
can
deal
with
any
future
threat
to
the
united
states
to
our
forces
overseas
and
to
our
friends
and
allies
the
quality
of
american
technology
thanks
to
the
american
worker
has
enabled
us
to
successfully
deal
with
difficult
military
conditions
and
help
minimize
the
loss
of
life
we
have
given
our
men
and
women
the
very
best
and
they
deserve
it
we
all
have
a
special
place
in
our
hearts
for
the
families
of
men
and
women
serving
in
the
gulf
they
are
represented
here
tonight
by
mrs
norman
schwarzkopf
and
to
all
those
serving
with
him
and
to
the
families
let
me
say
our
forces
in
the
gulf
will
not
stay
there
one
day
longer
than
is
necessary
to
complete
their
mission
the
courage
and
success
of
the
raf
pilotsof
the
kuwaiti
saudi
french
canadians
italians
the
pilots
of
qatar
and
bahrainall
are
proof
that
for
the
first
time
since
world
war
ii
the
international
community
is
united
the
leadership
of
the
united
nations
once
only
a
hopedfor
ideal
is
now
confirming
its
founders
vision
i
am
heartened
that
we
are
not
being
asked
to
bear
alone
the
financial
burden
of
this
struggle
last
year
our
friends
and
allies
provided
the
bulk
of
the
economic
costs
of
desert
shield
and
having
now
received
commitments
of
over
billion
for
the
first
three
months
of
i
am
confident
they
will
do
no
less
as
we
move
through
desert
storm
but
the
world
has
to
wonder
what
the
dictator
of
iraq
is
thinking
if
he
thinks
that
by
targeting
innocent
civilians
in
israel
and
saudi
arabia
that
he
will
gain
an
advantagehe
is
dead
wrong
if
he
thinks
that
he
will
advance
his
cause
through
tragic
and
despicable
environmental
terrorismhe
is
dead
wrong
and
if
he
thinks
that
by
abusing
coalition
pows
he
will
benefithe
is
dead
wrong
we
will
succeed
in
the
gulf
and
when
we
do
the
world
community
will
have
sent
an
enduring
warning
to
any
dictator
or
despot
present
or
future
who
contemplates
ou
tlaw
aggression
the
world
can
therefore
seize
this
opportunity
to
fulfill
the
longheld
promise
of
a
new
world
orderwhere
brutality
will
go
unrewarded
and
aggression
will
meet
collective
resistance
yes
the
united
states
bears
a
major
share
of
leadership
in
this
effort
among
the
nations
of
the
world
only
the
united
states
of
america
has
had
both
the
moral
standing
and
the
means
to
back
it
up
we
are
the
only
nation
on
this
earth
that
could
assemble
the
forces
of
peace
this
is
the
burden
of
leadershipand
the
strength
that
has
made
america
the
beacon
of
freedom
in
a
searching
world
this
nation
has
never
found
glory
in
war
our
people
have
never
wanted
to
abandon
the
blessings
of
home
and
work
for
distant
lands
and
deadly
conflict
if
we
fight
in
anger
it
is
only
because
we
have
to
fight
at
all
and
all
of
us
yearn
for
a
world
where
we
will
never
have
to
fight
again
each
of
us
will
measure
within
ourselves
the
value
of
this
great
struggle
any
cost
in
lives
is
beyond
our
power
to
measure
but
the
cost
of
closing
our
eyes
to
aggression
is
beyond
mankinds
power
to
imagine
this
we
do
know
our
cause
is
just
our
cause
is
moral
our
cause
is
right
let
future
generations
understand
the
burden
and
the
blessings
of
freedom
let
them
say
we
stood
where
duty
required
us
to
stand
let
them
know
that
together
we
affirmed
america
and
the
world
as
a
community
of
conscience
the
winds
of
change
are
with
us
now
the
forces
of
freedom
are
united
we
move
toward
the
next
century
more
confident
than
ever
that
we
have
the
will
at
home
and
abroad
to
do
what
must
be
donethe
hard
work
of
freedom
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america

means
for
america
there
are
singular
moments
in
history
dates
that
divide
all
that
goes
before
from
all
that
comes
after
and
many
of
us
in
this
chamber
have
lived
much
of
our
lives
in
a
world
whose
fundamental
features
were
defined
in
and
the
events
of
that

a
policy
based
upon
a
single
shining
principle
the
cause

america
not

the

but
an
idea
alive
in

at
the
center

our

the
enduring
dream
of
every

who
ever
set

on
these
shores
and
the
millions
still
struggling
to
be
free
this
nation
this
idea
called
america
was
and
always
will
be
a
new
world
our
new
world
at
a
workers
rally
in
a
place
called
branik
on
the
outskirts
of
prague
the
idea
called
america
is
alive
a
worker
dressed
in
grimy
overalls
rises
to
speak
at
the
factory
gates
and
he
begins
his
speech
to
his
fellow
citizens
with
these
words
words
of
a
distant
revolution
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
selfevident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
and
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
its
no
secret
here
at
home
freedoms
door
opened
long
ago
the
cornerstones
of
this
free
society
have
already
been
set
in
place
democracy
competition
opportunity
private
investment
stewardship
and
of
course
leadership
and
our
challenge
today
is
to
take
this
democratic
system
of
ours
a
system
second
to
none
and
make
it
better
a
better
america
where
theres
a
job
for
whoever
wants
one
where
women
working
outside
the
home
can
be
confident
their
children
are
in
safe
and
loving
care
and
where
government
works
to
expand
child
alternatives
for
parents
where
we
reconcile
the
needs
of
a
clean
environment
and
a
strong
economy
where
made
in
the
usa
is
recognized
around
the
world
as
the
symbol
of
quality
and
progress
and
where
every
one
of
us
enjoys
the
same
opportunities
to
live
to
work
and
to
contribute
to
society
and
where
for
the
first
time
the
american
mainstream
includes
all
of
our
disabled
citizens
where
everyone
has
a
roof
over
his
head
and
where
the
homeless
get
the
help
they
need
to
live
in
dignity
where
our
schools
challenge
and
support
our
kids
and
our
teachers
and
every
one
of
them
makes
the
grade
where
every
street
every
city
every
school
and
every
child
is
drugfree
and
finally
and
finally
where
no
american
is
forgotten
our
hearts
go
out
to
our
hostages
our
hostages
who
are
ceaselessly
in
our
minds
and
in
our
efforts
thats
part
of
the
future
we
want
to
see
the
future
we
can
make
for
ourselves
but
dreams
alone
wont
get
us
there
we
need
to
extend
our
horizon
to
commit
to
the
long
view
and
our
mission
for
the
future
starts
today
in
the
tough
competitive
markets
around
the
world
america
faces
the
great
challenges
and
great
opportunities
and
we
know
that
we
can
succeed
in
the
global
economic
arena
of
the
s
but
to
meet
that
challenge
we
must
make
some
fundamental
changes
some
crucial
investments
in
ourselves
yes
we
are
going
to
invest
in
america
this
administration
is
determined
to
encourage
the
creation
of
capital
capital
of
all
kinds
physical
capital
everything
from
our
farms
and
factories
to
our
workshops
and
production
lines
all
that
is
needed
to
produce
and
deliver
quality
goods
and
quality
services
intellectual
intellectual
capital
the
source
of
ideas
that
spark
tomorrows
products
and
of
course
human
capital
the
talented
work
force
that
well
need
to
compete
in
the
global
market
and
let
me
tell
you
if
we
ignore
human
capital
if
we
lose
the
spirit
of
american
ingenuity
the
sprit
that
is
the
hallmark
of
the
american
worker
that
would
be
bad
the
american
worker
is
the
most
productive
worker
in
the
world
we
need
to
save
more
we
need
to
expand
the
pool
of
capital
for
new
investments
that
mean
more
jobs
and
more
growth
and
thats
the
idea
behind
the
new
initiative
i
call
the
family
savings
plan
which
i
will
send
to
congress
tomorrow
we
need
to
cut
the
tax
on
capital
gains
encourage
encourage
risktakers
especially
those
in
small
businesses
to
take
those
steps
that
translate
into
economic
reward
jobs
and
a
better
life
for
all
of
us
well
do
what
it
takes
to
invest
in
americas
future
the
budget
commitment
is
there
the
money
is
there
its
there
for
research
and
development
r
and
d
a
record
high
its
there
for
our
housing
initiative
hope
hope
to
help
everyone
from
firsttime
homebuyers
to
the
homeless
the
moneys
there
to
keep
our
kids
drugfree
percent
more
than
when
i
took
office
in
its
there
for
space
exploration
and
its
there
for
education
another
record
high
and
one
more
and
one
more
thing
last
fall
at
the
education
summit
the
governors
and
i
agreed
to
look
for
ways
to
help
make
sure
that
our
kids
are
ready
to
learn
the
very
first
day
they
walk
into
the
classroom
and
ive
made
good
on
that
commitment
by
proposing
a
record
increase
in
funds
an
extra
half
billion
dollars
for
something
near
and
dear
to
all
of
us
head
start
education
is
the
one
investment
that
means
more
for
our
future
because
it
means
the
most
for
our
children
real
improvement
in
our
schools
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
spending
more
its
a
matter
of
asking
more
expecting
more
of
our
schools
our
teachers
of
our
kids
of
our
parents
and
of
ourselves
and
thats
why
tonight
and
thats
why
tonight
i
am
announcing
americas
education
goals
goals
developed
with
enormous
cooperation
from
the
nations
governors
and
if
i
might
id
like
to
say
im
very
pleased
that
governor
gardner
and
governor
clinton
governor
branstad
governor
campbell
all
of
whom
were
very
key
in
these
discussion
these
deliberations
are
with
us
here
tonight
by
the
by
the
year
every
child
must
start
school
ready
to
learn
the
united
states
must
increase
the
high
school
graduation
rate
to
no
less
than
percent
and
we
are
going
to
make
sure
our
schools
diplomas
mean
something
in
critical
subjects
at
the
fourth
eighth
and
th
grades
we
must
assess
our
students
performance
by
the
by
the
year
us
students
must
be
the
first
in
the
world
in
math
and
science
achievement
every
american
adult
must
be
a
skilled
literate
worker
and
citizen
every
school
must
offer
the
kind
of
disciplined
environment
that
makes
it
possible
for
our
kids
to
learn
and
every
school
in
america
must
be
drugfree
ambitious
aims
of
course
easy
to
do
far
from
it
but
the
futures
at
stake
the
nation
will
not
accept
anything
less
than
excellence
in
education
these
investments
will
help
keep
america
competitive
and
i
know
this
about
the
american
people
we
welcome
competition
well
match
our
ingenuity
our
energy
our
experience
and
technology
our
spirit
and
enterprise
against
anyone
but
let
the
competition
be
free
but
let
it
also
be
fair
america
is
ready
since
we
really
mean
it
and
since
were
serious
about
being
ready
to
meet
our
challenge
were
getting
our
own
house
in
order
we
have
made
real
progress
seven
years
ago
the
federal
deficit
was
percent
of
our
gross
national
product
percent
in
the
new
budget
i
sent
up
two
days
ago
the
deficit
is
down
to
percent
of
gnp
that
budget
brings
federal
spending
under
control
it
meets
the
grammrudman
target
it
brings
the
deficit
down
further
and
balances
the
budget
by
with
no
new
taxes
and
let
me
tell
you
theres
still
more
than
enough
federal
spending
for
most
of
us
trillion
is
still
a
lot
of
money
and
once
the
budget
is
balanced
we
can
operate
the
way
every
family
must
when
it
has
bills
to
pay
we
wont
leave
it
to
our
children
and
grandchildren
once
its
balanced
we
will
start
paying
off
the
national
debt
and
theres
something
more
and
theres
something
more
we
owe
the
generations
of
the
future
stewardship
the
safekeeping
of
americas
precious
environmental
inheritance
as
just
one
sign
of
how
serious
we
are
we
will
elevate
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
cabinet
rank
not
not
more
bureaucracy
not
more
red
tape
but
the
certainty
that
here
at
home
and
especially
in
our
dealings
with
other
nations
en
vironmental
issues
have
the
status
they
deserve
this
years
budget
provides
over
billion
in
new
spending
to
protect
our
environment
with
over
billion
for
global
change
research
and
a
new
initiative
i
call
america
the
beautiful
to
expand
our
national
parks
and
wildlife
preserves
and
improve
recreational
facilities
on
public
lands
and
something
else
something
that
will
help
keep
this
country
clean
from
our
forest
land
to
the
inner
cities
and
keep
america
beautiful
for
generations
to
come
the
money
to
plant
a
billion
trees
a
year
and
tonight
and
tonight
let
me
say
again
to
all
the
members
of
the
congress
the
american
people
did
not
send
us
here
to
bicker
there
is
work
to
do
and
they
sent
us
here
to
get
it
done
and
once
again
in
the
spirit
of
cooperation
i
offer
my
hand
to
all
of
you
and
lets
work
together
to
do
the
will
of
the
peopleclean
air
child
care
the
educational
excellence
act
crime
and
drugs
its
time
to
act
the
farm
bill
transportation
policy
product
liability
reform
enterprise
zones
its
time
to
act
together
and
theres
one
thing
i
hope
we
can
agree
on
its
about
our
commitments
and
im
talking
about
social
security
to
every
american
out
there
on
social
security
to
every
every
american
supporting
that
system
today
and
to
everyone
counting
on
it
when
they
retire
we
made
a
promise
to
you
and
we
are
going
to
keep
it
we
we
rescued
the
system
in
and
its
sound
again
bipartisan
arrangement
our
budget
fully
funds
todays
benefits
and
it
assures
that
future
benefits
will
be
funded
as
well
and
the
last
thing
we
need
to
do
is
mess
around
with
social
security
theres
one
more
problem
we
need
to
address
we
must
give
careful
consideration
to
the
recommendations
of
the
health
care
studies
under
way
now
and
thats
why
tonight
i
am
asking
dr
sullivan
lou
sullivan
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
to
lead
a
domestic
policy
council
review
of
recommendations
on
the
quality
accessibility
and
cost
of
our
nations
health
care
system
i
am
committed
to
bring
the
staggering
costs
of
health
care
under
control
the
state
of
the
government
does
indeed
depend
on
many
of
us
in
this
very
chamber
but
the
state
of
the
union
depends
on
all
americans
we
must
maintain
the
democratic
decency
that
makes
a
nation
out
of
millions
of
individuals
and
ive
been
appalled
at
the
recent
mail
bombings
across
this
country
every
one
of
us
must
confront
and
condemn
racism
antisemitism
bigotry
and
hate
not
next
week
not
tomorrow
but
right
now
every
single
one
of
us
the
state
of
the
union
depends
on
whether
we
help
our
neighbor
claim
the
problems
of
our
community
as
our
own
weve
got
to
step
forward
when
theres
trouble
lend
a
hand
be
what
i
call
a
point
of
light
to
a
stranger
in
need
weve
got
to
take
the
time
after
a
busy
day
to
sit
down
and
read
with
our
kids
help
them
with
their
homework
pass
along
the
values
we
had
as
children
and
thats
how
we
sustain
the
state
of
the
union
every
effort
is
important
it
all
adds
up
its
doing
the
things
that
give
democracy
meaning
it
all
adds
up
to
who
we
are
and
who
we
will
be
and
let
me
say
that
so
long
as
we
remember
the
american
idea
so
long
as
we
live
up
to
the
american
ideal
the
state
of
the
union
will
remain
sound
and
strong
and
to
those
who
worry
that
weve
lost
our
way
well
i
want
you
to
listen
to
parts
of
a
letter
written
by
james
markwell
pvt
st
class
james
markwell
a
yearold
army
medic
to
the
first
battalion
th
rangers
its
dated
dec
the
day
before
our
armed
forces
went
into
action
in
panama
its
a
letter
servicemen
writeand
hope
will
never
ever
be
sent
and
sadly
private
markwells
mother
did
receive
this
letter
she
passed
it
on
to
me
out
there
in
cincinnati
and
here
is
some
of
what
he
wrote
ive
never
been
afraid
of
death
but
i
know
he
is
waiting
at
the
cornerive
been
trained
to
kill
and
to
save
and
so
has
everyone
else
i
am
frightened
of
what
lays
beyond
the
fog
and
yet
do
not
mourn
for
me
revel
in
the
life
that
i
have
died
to
give
you
but
most
of
all
dont
forget
that
the
army
was
my
choice
something
that
i
wanted
to
do
remember
i
joined
the
army
to
serve
my
country
and
inure
that
you
are
free
to
do
what
you
want
and
to
live
your
lives
freely
let
me
add
that
private
markwell
was
among
the
first
to
see
battle
in
panama
and
among
the
first
to
fall
but
he
knew
what
he
believed
in
he
carried
the
idea
we
call
america
in
his
heart
i
began
tonight
speaking
about
the
changes
weve
seen
this
past
year
there
is
a
new
world
of
challenges
and
opportunities
before
us
and
there
is
a
need
for
leadership
that
only
america
can
provide
nearly
years
ago
in
his
last
address
to
the
congress
president
harry
truman
predicted
such
a
time
would
come
he
said
as
our
world
grows
stronger
more
united
more
attractive
to
men
on
both
sides
of
the
iron
curtain
then
inevitably
there
will
come
a
time
of
change
within
the
communist
world
today
that
change
is
taking
place
for
more
than
years
america
and
its
allies
held
communism
in
check
and
insured
that
democracy
would
continue
to
exist
and
today
with
communism
crumbling
our
aim
must
be
to
insure
democracys
advance
to
take
the
lead
in
forging
peace
and
freedoms
best
hope
a
great
and
growing
commonwealth
of
free
nations
and
to
the
congress
and
to
all
americans
i
say
it
is
time
to
acclaim
a
new
consensus
at
home
and
abroad
a
common
vision
of
the
peaceful
world
we
want
to
see
here
in
our
own
hemisphere
it
is
time
for
all
the
people
of
the
americas
north
and
south
to
live
in
freedom
in
the
far
east
and
africa
its
time
for
the
full
flowering
of
free
governments
and
free
markets
that
have
served
the
engine
of
progress
it
is
time
to
offer
our
hand
to
the
emerging
democracies
of
eastern
europe
so
that
continent
for
too
long
a
continent
divided
can
see
a
future
whole
and
free
its
time
to
build
on
our
new
relationship
with
the
soviet
union
to
endorse
and
encourage
a
peaceful
process
of
internal
change
toward
democracy
and
economic
opportunity
we
are
in
a
period
of
great
transition
great
hope
and
yet
great
uncertainty
we
recognize
that
the
soviet
military
threat
in
europe
is
diminishing
but
we
see
little
change
in
soviet
strategic
modernization
and
therefore
we
must
sustain
our
own
strategic
offense
modernization
and
the
strategic
defense
initiative
but
the
time
is
right
to
move
forward
on
a
conventional
arms
control
agreement
to
move
us
to
more
appropriate
levels
of
military
forces
in
europe
a
coherent
defense
program
that
insures
the
us
will
continue
to
be
a
catalyst
for
peaceful
change
in
europe
and
ive
consulted
with
leaders
of
nato
in
fact
i
spoke
by
phone
with
president
gorbachev
just
today
and
i
agree
with
our
european
allies
that
an
american
military
presence
in
europe
is
essential
and
that
it
should
not
be
solely
tied
to
the
soviet
military
presence
in
eastern
europe
but
our
troop
levels
can
still
be
lower
and
so
tonight
i
am
announcing
a
major
new
step
for
a
further
reduction
in
us
and
soviet
manpower
in
central
and
eastern
europe
to
on
each
side
this
number
this
number
this
level
reflects
the
advice
of
our
senior
military
advisers
its
designed
to
protect
american
and
european
interests
and
sustain
natos
defense
strategy
a
swift
conclusion
to
our
arms
control
talksconventional
chemical
and
strategicmust
now
be
our
goal
and
that
time
has
come
still
we
must
recognize
an
unfortunate
fact
in
many
regions
of
the
world
tonight
the
reality
is
conflict
not
peace
enduring
animosities
and
opposing
interests
remain
and
thus
the
cause
of
peace
must
be
served
by
an
america
strong
enough
and
sure
enough
to
defend
our
interests
and
our
ideals
its
this
american
idea
that
for
the
past
four
decades
helped
inspire
the
revolution
of
and
here
at
home
and
in
the
world
there
is
history
in
the
making
and
history
to
be
made
six
months
ago
early
in
this
season
of
change
i
stood
at
the
gates
of
the
gdansk
shipyard
in
poland
at
the
monument
to
the
fallen
workers
of
solidarity
its
a
monument
of
simple
majesty
three
tall
crosses
rise
up
from
the
stones
and
atop
each
cross
an
anchor
an
ancient
symbol
of
hope
the
anchor
in
our
world
today
is
freedom
holding
us
steady
in
times
of
change
a
symbol
of
hope
to
all
the
world
and
freedom
is
at
the
very
heart
of
the
idea
that
is
america
giving
life
to
the
idea
depends
on
every
one
of
us
our
anchor
has
always
been
faith
and
family
in
the
last
few
days
of
this
past
monumentous
year
our
family
was
blessed
once
more
celebrating
the
joy
of
life
when
a
little
boy
became
our
th
grandchild
when
i
held
the
little
guy
for
the
first
time
the
troubles
at
home
and
abroad
seemed
manageable
and
totally
in
perspective
and
now
i
know
i
know
youre
probably
thinking
well
thats
just
a
grandfather
talking
well
maybe
youre
right
but
ive
met
a
lot
of
children
this
past
year
across
this
country
as
all
of
you
have
everywhere
from
the
far
east
to
eastern
europe
all
kids
are
unique
yet
all
kids
are
alike
the
budding
young
environmentalist
i
met
this
month
who
joined
me
in
exploring
the
florida
everglades
the
little
leaguers
i
played
catch
with
in
poland
ready
to
go
from
warsaw
to
the
world
series
and
even
the
kids
who
are
ill
or
aloneand
god
bless
those
boarder
babies
born
addicted
to
drugs
and
aidscoping
with
problems
no
child
should
have
to
face
but
you
know
when
it
comes
to
hope
and
the
future
every
kid
is
the
same
full
of
dreams
ready
to
take
on
the
world
all
special
because
they
are
the
very
future
of
freedom
and
to
them
belongs
this
new
world
ive
been
speaking
about
and
so
tonight
im
going
to
ask
something
of
every
one
of
you
now
let
me
start
with
my
generation
with
the
grandparents
out
there
you
are
our
living
link
with
the
past
tell
your
grandchildren
the
story
of
struggles
waged
at
home
and
abroad
of
sacrifices
freely
made
for
freedoms
sake
and
tell
them
your
own
story
as
well
because
every
american
has
a
story
to
tell
and
parents
your
children
look
to
you
for
direction
and
guidance
tell
them
of
faith
and
family
tell
them
we
are
one
nation
under
god
teach
them
that
of
all
the
many
gifts
they
can
receive
liberty
is
their
most
precious
legacy
and
of
all
the
gifts
they
can
give
the
greatest
the
greatest
is
helping

others
and
to
the
children
and
young
people
out
there
tonight
with
you
rests
our
hope
all
that
america
will
mean
in
the
years
and
decades
ahead
fix
your
vision
on
a
new
century
your
century
on
dreams
we
cannot
see
on
the
destiny
that
is
yours
and
yours
alone
and
finally
let
all
americans
all
of
us
here
in
this
chamber
the
symbolic
center
of
democracy
affirm
our
allegiance
to
this
idea
we
call
america
and
let
us
remember
that
the
state
of
the
union
depends
upon
each
and
every
one
of
us
god
bless
all
of
you
and
may
god
bless
this
great
nation
the
united
states
of
america

mr
speaker
mr
president
and
distinguished
members
of
the
house
and
senate
honored
guests
and
fellow
citizens
less
than
weeks
ago
i
joined
you
on
the
west
front
of
this
very
building
and
looking
over
the
monuments
to
our
proud
past
offered
you
my
hand
in
filling
the
next
page
of
american
history
with
a
story
of
extended
prosperity
and
continued
peace
and
tonight
im
back
to
offer
you
my
plans
as
well
the
hand
remains
extended
the
sleeves
are
rolled
up
america
is
waiting
and
now
we
must
produce
together
we
can
build
a
better
america
it
is
comforting
to
return
to
this
historic
chamber
here
years
ago
i
first
raised
my
hand
to
be
sworn
into
public
life
so
tonight
i
feel
as
if
im
returning
home
to
friends
and
i
intend
in
the
months
and
years
to
come
to
give
you
what
friends
deserve
frankness
respect
and
my
best
judgment
about
ways
to
improve
americas
future
in
return
i
ask
for
an
honest
commitment
to
our
common
mission
of
progress
if
we
seize
the
opportunities
on
the
road
before
us
therell
be
praise
enough
for
all
the
people
didnt
send
us
here
to
bicker
and
its
time
to
govern
and
many
presidents
have
come
to
this
chamber
in
times
of
great
crisis
war
and
depression
loss
of
national
spirit
and
years
ago
i
sat
in
that
very
chair
as
president
reagan
spoke
of
punishing
inflation
and
devastatingly
high
interest
rates
and
people
out
of
work
american
confidence
on
the
wane
and
our
challenge
is
different
were
fortunate
a
much
changed
landscape
lies
before
us
tonight
so
i
dont
propose
to
reverse
direction
were
headed
the
right
way
but
we
cannot
rest
were
a
people
whose
energy
and
drive
have
fueled
our
rise
to
greatness
and
were
a
forwardlooking
nation
generous
yes
but
ambitious
not
for
ourselves
but
for
the
world
complacency
is
not
in
our
character
not
before
not
now
not
ever
and
so
tonight
we
must
take
a
strong
america
and
make
it
even
better
we
must
address
some
very
real
problems
we
must
establish
some
very
clear
priorities
and
we
must
make
a
very
substantial
cut
in
the
federal
budget
deficit
some
people
find
that
agenda
impossible
but
im
presenting
to
you
tonight
a
realistic
plan
for
tackling
it
my
plan
has
four
broad
features
attention
to
urgent
priorities
investment
in
the
future
an
attack
on
the
deficit
and
no
new
taxes
this
budget
represents
my
best
judgment
of
how
we
can
address
our
priorities
there
are
many
areas
in
which
we
would
all
like
to
spend
more
than
i
propose
i
understand
that
but
we
cannot
until
we
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order
next
year
alone
thanks
to
economic
growth
without
any
change
in
the
law
the
federal
government
will
take
in
over
billion
more
than
it
does
this
year
thats
right
over
billion
in
new
revenues
with
no
increases
in
taxes
and
our
job
is
to
allocate
those
new
resources
wisely
we
can
afford
to
increase
spending
by
a
modest
amount
but
enough
to
invest
in
key
priorities
and
still
cut
the
deficit
by
almost
percent
in
year
and
that
will
allow
us
to
meet
the
targets
set
forth
in
the
grammrudmanhollings
law
but
to
do
that
we
must
recognize
that
growth
above
inflation
in
federal
programs
is
not
preordained
that
not
all
spending
initiatives
were
designed
to
be
immortal
i
make
this
pledge
tonight
my
team
and
i
are
ready
to
work
with
the
congress
to
form
a
special
leadership
group
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
to
work
day
and
night
if
thats
what
it
takes
to
meet
the
budget
targets
and
to
produce
a
budget
on
time
we
cannot
settle
for
business
as
usual
government
by
continuing
resolution
or
government
by
crisis
will
not
do
and
i
ask
the
congress
tonight
to
approve
several
measures
which
will
make
budgeting
more
sensible
we
could
save
time
and
improve
efficiency
by
enacting
year
budgets
fortythree
governors
have
the
lineitem
veto
presidents
should
have
it
too
and
at
the
very
least
when
a
president
proposes
to
rescind
federal
spending
the
congress
should
be
required
to
vote
on
that
proposal
instead
of
killing
it
by
inaction
and
i
ask
the
congress
to
honor
the
publics
wishes
by
passing
a
constitutional
amendment
to
require
a
balanced
budget
such
an
amendment
once
phased
in
will
discipline
both
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
several
principles
describe
the
kind
of
america
i
hope
to
build
with
your
help
in
the
years
ahead
we
will
not
have
the
luxury
of
taking
the
easy
spendthrift
approach
to
solving
problems
because
higher
spending
and
higher
taxes
put
economic
growth
at
risk
economic
growth
provides
jobs
and
hope
economic
growth
enables
us
to
pay
for
social
programs
economic
growth
enhances
the
security
of
the
nation
and
low
tax
rates
create
economic
growth
i
believe
in
giving
americans
greater
freedom
and
greater
choice
and
i
will
work
for
choice
for
american
families
whether
in
the
housing
in
which
they
live
the
schools
to
which
they
send
their
children
or
the
child
care
they
select
for
their
young
you
see
i
believe
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
those
in
need
but
that
government
should
not
be
the
provider
of
first
resort
for
things
that
the
private
sector
can
produce
better
i
believe
in
a
society
that
is
free
from
discrimination
and
bigotry
of
any
kind
and
i
will
work
to
knock
down
the
barriers
left
by
past
discrimination
and
to
build
a
more
tolerant
society
that
will
stop
such
barriers
from
ever
being
built
again
i
believe
that
family
and
faith
represent
the
moral
compass
of
the
nation
and
ill
work
to
make
them
strong
for
as
benjamin
franklin
said
if
a
sparrow
cannot
fall
to
the
ground
without
his
notice
can
a
great
nation
rise
without
his
aid
and
i
believe
in
giving
people
the
power
to
make
their
own
lives
better
through
growth
and
opportunity
and
together
lets
put
power
in
the
hands
of
people
three
weeks
ago
we
celebrated
the
bicentennial
inaugural
the
th
anniversary
of
the
first
presidency
and
if
you
look
back
one
thing
is
so
striking
about
the
way
the
founding
fathers
looked
at
america
they
didnt
talk
about
themselves
they
talked
about
posterity
they
talked
about
the
future
and
we
too
must
think
in
terms
bigger
than
ourselves
we
must
take
actions
today
that
will
ensure
a
better
tomorrow
we
must
extend
american
leadership
in
technology
increase
longterm
investment
improve
our
educational
system
and
boost
productivity
these
are
the
keys
to
building
a
better
future
and
here
are
some
of
my
recommendations
i
propose
almost
billion
for
the
national
science
foundation
to
promote
basic
research
and
keep
us
on
track
to
double
its
budget
by
i
propose
to
make
permanent
the
tax
credit
for
research
and
development
ive
asked
vice
president
quayle
to
chair
a
new
task
force
on
competitiveness
and
i
request
funding
for
nasa
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration
and
a
strong
space
program
an
increase
of
almost
billion
over
the
current
fiscal
year
we
must
have
a
manned
space
station
a
vigorous
safe
space
shuttle
program
and
more
commercial
development
in
space
the
space
program
should
always
go
full
throttle
up
and
thats
not
just
our
ambition
its
our
destiny
i
propose
that
we
cut
the
maximum
tax
rate
on
capital
gains
to
increase
longterm
investment
history
on
this
is
clear
this
will
increase
revenues
help
savings
and
create
new
jobs
we
wont
be
competitive
if
we
leave
whole
sectors
of
america
behind
this
is
the
year
we
should
finally
enact
urban
enterprise
zones
and
bring
hope
to
the
inner
cities
but
the
most
important
competitiveness
program
of
all
is
one
which
improves
education
in
america
when
some
of
our
students
actually
have
trouble
locating
america
on
a
map
of
the
world
it
is
time
for
us
to
map
a
new
approach
to
education
we
must
reward
excellence
and
cut
through
bureaucracy
we
must
help
schools
that
need
help
the
most
we
must
give
choice
to
parents
students
teachers
and
principals
and
we
must
hold
all
concerned
accountable
in
education
we
cannot
tolerate
mediocrity
i
want
to
cut
that
dropout
rate
and
make
america
a
more
literate
nation
because
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is
this
the
longer
our
graduation
lines
are
today
the
shorter
our
unemployment
lines
will
be
tomorrow
so
tonight
im
proposing
the
following
initiatives
the
beginning
of
a
million
program
to
reward
americas
best
schools
merit
schools
the
creation
of
special
presidential
awards
for
the
best
teachers
in
every
state
because
excellence
should
be
rewarded
the
establishment
of
a
new
program
of
national
science
scholars
one
each
year
for
every
member
of
the
house
and
senate
to
give
this
generation
of
students
a
special
incentive
to
excel
in
science
and
mathematics
the
expanded
use
of
magnet
schools
which
give
families
and
students
greater
choice
and
a
new
program
to
encourage
alternative
certification
which
will
let
talented
people
from
all
fields
teach
in
our
classrooms
ive
said
id
like
to
be
the
education
president
and
tonight
id
ask
you
to
join
me
by
becoming
the
education
congress
just
last
week
as
i
settled
into
this
new
office
i
received
a
letter
from
a
mother
in
pennsylvania
who
had
been
struck
by
my
message
in
the
inaugural
address
not
hours
before
she
wrote
my
husband
and
i
received
word
that
our
son
was
addicted
to
cocaine
he
had
the
world
at
his
feet
bright
gifted
personable
he
could
have
done
anything
with
his
life
and
now
he
has
chosen
cocaine
and
please
she
wrote
find
a
way
to
curb
the
supply
of
cocaine
get
tough
with
the
pushers
our
son
needs
your
help
my
friends
that
voice
crying
out
for
help
could
be
the
voice
of
your
own
neighbor
your
own
friend
your
own
son
over
million
americans
used
illegal
drugs
last
year
at
a
staggering
cost
to
our
nations
wellbeing
let
this
be
recorded
as
the
time
when
america
rose
up
and
said
no
to
drugs
the
scourge
of
drugs
must
be
stopped
and
i
am
asking
tonight
for
an
increase
of
almost
a
billion
dollars
in
budget
outlays
to
escalate
the
war
against
drugs
the
war
must
be
waged
on
all
fronts
our
new
drug
czar
bill
bennett
and
i
will
be
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
executive
branch
leading
the
charge
some
money
will
be
used
to
expand
treatment
to
the
poor
and
to
young
mothers
this
will
offer
the
helping
hand
to
the
many
innocent
victims
of
drugs
like
the
thousands
of
babies
born
addicted
or
with

aids
because
of
the
mothers
addiction
some
will
be
used
to
cut
the
waiting
time
for
treatment
some
money
will
be
devoted
to
those
urban
schools
where
the
emergency
is
now
the
worst
and
much
of
it
will
be
used
to
protect
our
borders
with
help
from
the
coast
guard
and
the
customs
service
the
departments
of
state
and
justice
and
yes
the
us
military
i
mean
to
get
tough
on
the
drug
criminals
and
let
me
be
clear
this
president
will
back
up
those
who
put
their
lives
on
the
line
every
single
day
our
local
police
officers
my
budget
asks
for
beefedup
prosecution
for
a
new
attack
on
organized
crime
and
for
enforcement
of
tough
sentences
and
for
the
worst
kingpins
that
means
the
death
penalty
i
also
want
to
make
sure
that
when
a
drug
dealer
is
convicted
theres
a
cell
waiting
for
him
and
he
should
not
go
free
because
prisons
are
too
full
and
so
let
the
word
go
out
if
youre
caught
and
convicted
you
will
do
time
but
for
all
we
do
in
law
enforcement
in
interdiction
and
treatment
we
will
never
win
this
war
on
drugs
unless
we
stop
the
demand
for
drugs
so
some
of
this
increase
will
be
used
to
educate
the
young
about
the
dangers
of
drugs
we
must
involve
the
parents
we
must
involve
the
teachers
we
must
involve
the
communities
and
my
friends
we
must
involve
ourselves
each
and
every
one
of
us
in
this
concern
one
problem
related
to
drug
use
demands
our
urgent
attention
and
our
continuing
compassion
and
that
is
the
terrible
tragedy
of
aids
im
asking
for
billion
for
education
to
prevent
the
disease
and
for
research
to
find
a
cure
if
were
to
protect
our
future
we
need
a
new
attitude
about
the
environment
we
must
protect
the
air
we
breathe
i
will
send
to
you
shortly
legislation
for
a
new
more
effective
clean
air
act
it
will
include
a
plan
to
reduce
by
date
certain
the
emissions
which
cause
acid
rain
because
the
time
for
study
alone
has
passed
and
the
time
for
action
is
now
we
must
make
use
of
clean
coal
my
budget
contains
full
funding
on
schedule
for
the
clean
coal
technology
agreement
that
weve
made
with
canada
weve
made
that
agreement
with
canada
and
we
intend
to
honor
that
agreement
we
must
not
neglect
our
parks
so
im
asking
to
fund
new
acquisitions
under
the
land
and
water
conservation
fund
we
must
protect
our
oceans
and
i
support
new
penalties
against
those
who
would
dump
medical
waste
and
other
trash
into
our
oceans
the
age
of
the
needle
on
the
beaches
must
end
and
in
some
cases
the
gulfs
and
oceans
off
our
shores
hold
the
promise
of
oil
and
gas
reserves
which
can
make
our
nation
more
secure
and
less
dependent
on
foreign
oil
and
when
those
with
the
most
promise
can
be
tapped
safely
as
with
much
of
the
alaska
national
wildlife
refuge
we
should
proceed
but
we
must
use
caution
we
must
respect
the
environment
and
so
tonight
im
calling
for
the
indefinite
postponement
of
three
lease
sales
which
have
raised
troubling
questions
two
off
the
coast
of
california
and
one
which
could
threaten
the
everglades
in
florida
action
on
these
three
lease
sales
will
await
the
conclusion
of
a
special
task
force
set
up
to
measure
the
potential
for
environmental
damage
im
directing
the
attorney
general
and
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
use
every
tool
at
their
disposal
to
speed
and
toughen
the
enforcement
of
our
laws
against
toxicwaste
dumpers
i
want
faster
cleanups
and
tougher
enforcement
of
penalties
against
polluters
in
addition
to
caring
for
our
future
we
must
care
for
those
around
us
a
decent
society
shows
compassion
for
the
young
the
elderly
the
vulnerable
and
the
poor
our
first
obligation
is
to
the
most
vulnerable
infants
poor
mothers
children
living
in
poverty
and
my
proposed
budget
recognizes
this
i
ask
for
full
funding
of
medicaid
an
increase
of
over
billion
and
an
expansion
of
the
program
to
include
coverage
of
pregnant
women
who
are
near
the
poverty
line
i
believe
we
should
help
working
families
cope
with
the
burden
of
child
care
our
help
should
be
aimed
at
those
who
need
it
most
lowincome
families
with
young
children
i
support
a
new
child
care
tax
credit
that
will
aim
our
efforts
at
exactly
those
families
without
discriminating
against
mothers
who
choose
to
stay
at
home
now
i
know
there
are
competing
proposals
but
remember
this
the
overwhelming
majority
of
all
preschool
child
care
is
now
provided
by
relatives
and
neighbors
and
churches
and
community
groups
families
who
choose
these
options
should
remain
eligible
for
help
parents
should
have
choice
and
for
those
children
who
are
unwanted
or
abused
or
whose
parents
are
deceased
we
should
encourage
adoption
i
propose
to
reenact
the
tax
deduction
for
adoption
expenses
and
to
double
it
to
lets
make
it
easier
for
these
kids
to
have
parents
who
love
them
we
have
a
moral
contract
with
our
senior
citizens
and
in
this
budget
social
security
is
fully
funded
including
a
full
costofliving
adjustment
we
must
honor
our
contract
we
must
care
about
those
in
the
shadow
of
life
and
i
like
many
americans
am
deeply
troubled
by
the
plight
of
the
homeless
the
causes
of
homelessness
are
many
the
history
is
long
but
the
moral
imperative
to
act
is
clear
thanks
to
the
deep
well
of
generosity
in
this
great
land
many
organizations
already
contribute
but
we
in
government
cannot
stand
on
the
sidelines
in
my
budget
i
ask
for
greater
support
for
emergency
food
and
shelter
for
health
services
and
measures
to
prevent
substance
abuse
and
for
clinics
for
the
mentally
ill
and
i
propose
a
new
initiative
involving
the
full
range
of
government
agencies
we
must
confront
this
national
shame
theres
another
issue
that
ive
decided
to
mention
here
tonight
ive
long
believed
that
the
people
of
puerto
rico
should
have
the
right
to
determine
their
own
political
future
personally
i
strongly
favor
statehood
but
i
urge
the
congress
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
allow
the
people
to
decide
in
a
referendum
certain
problems
the
result
of
decades
of
unwise
practices
threaten
the
health
and
security
of
our
people
left
unattended
they
will
only
get
worse
but
we
can
act
now
to
put
them
behind
us
earlier
this
week
i
announced
my
support
for
a
plan
to
restore
the
financial
and
moral
integrity
of
our
savings
system
i
ask
congress
to
enact
our
reform
proposals
within
days
we
must
not
let
this
situation
fester
we
owe
it
to
the
savers
in
this
country
to
solve
this
problem
certainly
the
savings
of
americans
must
remain
secure
let
me
be
clear
insured
depositors
will
continue
to
be
fully
protected
but
any
plan
to
refinance
the
system
must
be
accompanied
by
major
reform
our
proposals
will
prevent
such
a
crisis
from
recurring
the
best
answer
is
to
make
sure
that
a
mess
like
this
will
never
happen
again
the
majority
of
thrifts
in
communities
across
the
nation
have
been
honest
theyve
played
a
major
role
in
helping
families
achieve
the
dream
of
home
ownership
but
make
no
mistake
those
who
are
corrupt
those
who
break
the
law
must
be
kicked
out
of
the
business
and
they
should
go
to
jail
we
face
a
massive
task
in
cleaning
up
the
waste
left
from
decades
of
environmental
neglect
at
americas
nuclear
weapons
plants
clearly
we
must
modernize
these
plants
and
operate
them
safely
thats
not
at
issue
our
national
security
depends
on
it
but
beyond
that
we
must
clean
up
the
old
mess
thats
been
left
behind
and
i
propose
in
this
budget
to
more
than
double
our
current
effort
to
do
so
this
will
allow
us
to
identify
the
exact
nature
of
the
various
problems
so
we
can
clean
them
up
and
clean
them
up
we
will
weve
been
fortunate
during
these
past
years
america
is
a
stronger
nation
than
it
was
in
morale
in
our
armed
forces
has
been
restored
our
resolve
has
been
shown
our
readiness
has
been
improved
and
we
are
at
peace
there
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
that
peace
has
been
made
more
secure
through
strength
and
when
america
is
stronger
the
world
is
safer
most
people
dont
realize
that
after
the
successful
restoration
of
our
strength
the
pentagon
budget
has
actually
been
reduced
in
real
terms
for
each
of
the
last
years
we
cannot
tolerate
continued
real
reduction
in
defense
in
light
of
the
compelling
need
to
reduce
the
deficit
however
i
support
a
year
freeze
in
the
military
budget
something
i
proposed
last
fall
in
my
flexible
freeze
plan
and
this
freeze
will
apply
for
only
year
and
after
that
increases
above
inflation
will
be
required
i
will
not
sacrifice
american
preparedness
and
i
will
not
compromise
american
strength
i
should
be
clear
on
the
conditions
attached
to
my
recommendation
for
the
coming
year
the
savings
must
be
allocated
to
those
priorities
for
investing
in
our
future
that
ive
spoken
about
tonight
this
defense
freeze
must
be
a
part
of
a
comprehensive
budget
agreement
which
meets
the
targets
spelled
out
in
grammrudmanhollings
law
without
raising
taxes
and
which
incorporates
reforms
in
the
budget
process
ive
directed
the
national
security
council
to
review
our
national
security
and
defense
policies
and
report
back
to
me
within
days
to
ensure
that
our
capabilities
and
resources
meet
our
commitments
and
strategies
im
also
charging
the
department
of
defense
with
the
task
of
developing
a
plan
to
improve
the
defense
procurement
process
and
management
of
the
pentagon
one
which
will
fully
implement
the
packard
commission
report
many
of
these
changes
can
only
be
made
with
the
participation
of
the
congress
and
so
i
ask
for
your
help
we
need
fewer
regulations
we
need
less
bureaucracy
we
need
multiyear
procurement
and
year
budgeting
and
frankly
and
dont
take
this
wrong
we
need
less
congressional
micromanagement
of
our
nations
military
policy
i
detect
a
slight
division
on
that
question
but
nevertheless
laughter
securing
a
more
peaceful
world
is
perhaps
the
most
important
priority
id
like
to
address
tonight
you
know
we
meet
at
a
time
of
extraordinary
hope
never
before
in
this
century
have
our
values
of
freedom
democracy
and
economic
opportunity
been
such
a
powerful
and
intellectual
force
around
the
globe
never
before
has
our
leadership
been
so
crucial
because
while
america
has
its
eyes
on
the
future
the
world
has
its
eyes
on
america
and
its
a
time
of
great
change
in
the

world
and
especially
in
the
soviet
union
prudence
and
common
sense
dictate
that
we
try
to
understand
the
full
meaning
of
the
change
going
on
there
review
our
policies
and
then
proceed
with
caution
but
ive
personally
assured
general
secretary
gorbachev
that
at
the
conclusion
of
such
a
review
we
will
be
ready
to
move
forward
we
will
not
miss
any
opportunity
to
work
for
peace
the
fundamental
facts
remain
that
the
soviets
retain
a
very
powerful
military
machine
in
the
service
of
objectives
which
are
still
too
often
in
conflict
with
ours
so
let
us
take
the
new
openness
seriously
but
lets
also
be
realistic
and
lets
always
be
strong
there
are
some
pressing
issues
we
must
address
i
will
vigorously
pursue
the
strategic
defense
initiative
the
spread
and
even
use
of
sophisticated
weaponry
threatens
global
security
as
never
before
chemical
weapons
must
be
banned
from
the
face
of
the
earth
never
to
be
used
again
and
look
this
wont
be
easy
verification
extraordinarily
difficult
but
civilization
and
human
decency
demand
that
we
try
and
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
must
be
stopped
and
ill
work
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
our
diplomacy
must
work
every
day
against
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons
and
around
the
globe
we
must
continue
to
be
freedoms
best
friend
and
we
must
stand
firm
for
selfdetermination
and
democracy
in
central
america
including
in
nicaragua
it
is
my
strongly
held
conviction
that
when
people
are
given
the
chance
they
inevitably
will
choose
a
free
press
freedom
of
worship
and
certifiably
free
and
fair
elections
we
must
strengthen
the
alliance
of
the
industrial
democracies
as
solid
a
force
for
peace
as
the
world
has
ever
known
and
this
is
an
alliance
forged
by
the
power
of
our
ideals
not
the
pettiness
of
our
differences
so
lets
lift
our
sights
to
rise
above
fighting
about
beef
hormones
to
building
a
better
future
to
move
from
protectionism
to
progress
ive
asked
the
secretary
of
state
to
visit
europe
next
week
and
to
consult
with
our
allies
on
the
wide
range
of
challenges
and
opportunities
we
face
together
including
eastwest
relations
and
i
look
forward
to
meeting
with
our
nato
partners
in
the
near
future
and
i
too
shall
begin
a
trip
shortly
to
the
far
reaches
of
the
pacific
basin
where
the
winds
of
democracy
are
creating
new
hope
and
the
power
of
free
markets
is
unleashing
a
new
force
when
i
served
as
our
representative
in
china
or
years
ago
few
would
have
predicted
the
scope
of
the
changes
weve
witnessed
since
then
but
in
preparing
for
this
trip
i
was
struck
by
something
i
came
across
from
a
chinese
writer
he
was
speaking
of
his
country
decades
ago
but
his
words
speak
to
each
of
us
in
america
tonight
today
he
said
were
afraid
of
the
simple
words
like
goodness
and
mercy
and
kindness
my
friends
if
were
to
succeed
as
a
nation
we
must
rediscover
those
words
in
just
days
we
mark
the
birthday
of
abraham
lincoln
the
man
who
saved
our
union
and
gave
new
meaning
to
the
word
opportunity
lincoln
once
said
i
hold
that
while
man
exists
it
is
his
duty
to
improve
not
only
his
own
condition
but
to
assist
in
ameliorating
that
of
mankind
it
is
this
broader
mission
to
which
i
call
all
americans
because
the
definition
of
a
successful
life
must
include
serving
others
and
to
the
young
people
of
america
who
sometimes
feel
left
out
i
ask
you
tonight
to
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
talent
and
energy

a
new
program

ultimate
end
of
your
work
to
make
a
better
product
to
create
better
lives
i
ask
you
to
plan
for
the
longer
term
and
avoid
that
temptation
of
quick
and
easy
paper
profits
to
the
brave
men
and
women
who
wear
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
your
calling
is
a
high
one
to
be
the
defenders
of
freedom
and
the
guarantors
of
liberty
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
this
nation

form
of
disability

in
the
economic
mainstream
we
need
your
talents
in
americas

must
become
full
partners
in
americas

tonight
in

living
rooms

fast
to
your
dreams
because
ultimately
americas
future
rests
in
your
hands
and
to
my
friends
in
this
chamber
i
ask
your
cooperation
to
keep
america
growing
while
cutting
the
deficit
thats
only
fair
to
those
who
now
have
no
vote
the
generations
to
come
let
them
look
back
and
say
that
we
had
the
foresight
to
understand
that
a
time
of
peace
and
prosperity
is
not
the
time
to
rest
but
a
time
to
press
forward
a
time
to
invest
in
the
future
and
let
all
americans
remember
that
no
problem
of
human
making
is
too
great
to
be
overcome
by
human
ingenuity
human
energy
and
the
untiring
hope
of
the
human
spirit
i
believe
this
i
would
not
have
asked
to
be
your
president
if
i
didnt
and
tomorrow
the
debate
on
the
plan
ive
put
forward
begins
and
i
ask
the
congress
to
come
forward
with
your
own
proposals
lets
not
question
each
others
motives
lets
debate
lets
negotiate
but
let
us
solve
the
problem
recalling
anniversaries
may
not
be
my
specialty
in
speeches
laughter
but
tonight
is
one
of
some
note
on
february
th
just
years
ago
tonight
sir
winston
churchill
took
to
the
airwaves
during
britains
hour
of
peril
hed
received
from
president
roosevelt
a
handcarried
letter
quoting
longfellows
famous
poem
sail
on
o
ship
of
state
sail
on
o
union
strong
and
great
humanity
with
all
its
fears
with
all
the
hopes
of
future
years
is
hanging
breathless
on
thy
fate
and
churchill
responded
on
this
night
by
radio
broadcast
to
a
nation
at
war
but
he
directed
his
words
to
franklin
roosevelt
we
shall
not
fail
or
falter
he
said
we
shall
not
weaken
or
tire
give
us
the
tools
and
we
will
finish
the
job
tonight
almost
half
a
century
later
our
peril
may
be
less
immediate
but
the
need
for
perseverance
and
clearsighted
fortitude
is
just
as
great
now
as
then
there
are
those
who
say
it
cant
be
done
there
are
voices
who
say
that
americas
best
days
have
passed
that
were
bound
by
constraints
threatened
by
problems
surrounded
by
troubles
which
limit
our
ability
to
hope
well
tonight
i
remain
full
of
hope
we
americans
have
only
begun
on
our
mission
of
goodness
and
greatness
and
to
those
timid
souls
i
repeat
the
plea
give
us
the
tools
and
we
will
do
the
job
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
america

mr
speaker
mr
president
and
distinguished
members
of
the
house
and
senate
when
we
first
met
here
years
agomany
of
us
for
the
first
timeit
was
with
the
hope
of
beginning
something
new
for
america
we
meet
here
tonight
in
this
historic
chamber
to
continue
that
work
if
anyone
expects
just
a
proud
recitation
of
the
accomplishments
of
my
administration
i
say
lets
leave
that
to
history
were
not
finished
yet
so
my
message
to
you
tonight
is
put
on
your
work
shoes
were
still
on
the
job
history
records
the
power
of
the
ideas
that
brought
us
here
those
years
agoideas
like
the
individuals
right
to
reach
as
far
and
as
high
as
his
or
her
talents
will
permit
the
free
market
as
an
engine
of
economic
progress
and
as
an
ancient
chinese
philosopher
laotzu
said
govern
a
great
nation
as
you
would
cook
a
small
fish
do
not
overdo
it
well
these
ideas
were
part
of
a
larger
notion
a
vision
if
you
will
of
america
herselfan
america
not
only
rich
in
opportunity
for
the
individual
but
an
america
too
of
strong
families
and
vibrant
neighborhoods
an
america
whose
divergent
but
harmonizing
communities
were
a
reflection
of
a
deeper
community
of
values
the
value
of
work
of
family
of
religion
and
of
the
love
of
freedom
that
god
places
in
each
of
us
and
whose
defense
he
has
entrusted
in
a
special
way
to
this
nation
all
of
this
was
made
possible
by
an
idea
i
spoke
of
when
mr
gorbachev
was
herethe
belief
that
the
most
exciting
revolution
ever
known
to
humankind
began
with
three
simple
words
we
the
people
the
revolutionary
notion
that
the
people
grant
government
its
rights
and
not
the
other
way
around
and
theres
one
lesson
that
has
come
home
powerfully
to
me
which
i
would
offer
to
you
now
just
as
those
who
created
this
republic
pledged
to
each
other
their
lives
their
fortunes
and
their
sacred
honor
so
too
americas
leaders
today
must
pledge
to
each
other
that
we
will
keep
foremost
in
our
hearts
and
minds
not
what
is
best
for
ourselves
or
for
our
party
but
what
is
best
for
america
in
the
spirit
of
jefferson
let
us
affirm
that
in
this
chamber
tonight
there
are
no
republicans
no
democratsjust
americans
yes
we
will
have
our
differences
but
let
us
always
remember
what
unites
us
far
outweighs
whatever
divides
us
those
who
sent
us
here
to
serve
themthe
millions
of
americans
watching
and
listening
tonightexpect
this
of
us
lets
prove
to
them
and
to
ourselves
that
democracy
works
even
in
an
election
year
weve
done
this
before
and
as
we
have
worked
together
to
bring
down
spending
tax
rates
and
inflation
employment
has
climbed
to
record
heights
america
has
created
more
jobs
and
better
higher
paying
jobs
family
income
has
risen
for
straight
years
and
americas
poor
climbed
out
of
poverty
at
the
fastest
rate
in
more
than
years
our
record
is
not
just
the
longest
peacetime
expansion
in
history
but
an
economic
and
social
revolution
of
hope
based
on
work
incentives
growth
and
opportunity
a
revolution
of
compassion
that
led
to
private
sector
initiatives
and
a
percent
increase
in
charitable
giving
a
revolution
that
at
a
critical
moment
in
world
history
reclaimed
and
restored
the
american
dream
in
international
relations
too
theres
only
one
description
for
what
together
we
have
achieved
a
complete
turnabout
a
revolution
seven
years
ago
america
was
weak
and
freedom
everywhere
was
under
siege
today
america
is
strong
and
democracy
is
everywhere
on
the
move
from
central
america
to
east
asia
ideas
like
free
markets
and
democratic
reforms
and
human
rights
are
taking
hold
weve
replaced
blame
america
with
look
up
to
america
weve
rebuilt
our
defenses
and
of
all
our
accomplishments
none
can
give
us
more
satisfaction
than
knowing
that
our
young
people
are
again
proud
to
wear
our
countrys
uniform
and
in
a
few
moments
im
going
to
talk
about
three
developmentsarms
reduction
the
strategic
defense
initiative
and
the
global
democratic
revolutionthat
when
taken
together
offer
a
chance
none
of
us
would
have
dared
imagine
years
ago
a
chance
to
rid
the
world
of
the
two
great
nightmares
of
the
postwar
era
i
speak
of
the
startling
hope
of
giving
our
children
a
future
free
of
both
totalitarianism
and
nuclear
terror
tonight
then
were
strong
prosperous
at
peace
and
we
are
free
this
is
the
state
of
our
union
and
if
we
will
work
together
this
year
i
believe
we
can
give
a
future
president
and
a
future
congress
the
chance
to
make
that
prosperity
that
peace
that
freedom
not
just
the
state
of
our
union
but
the
state
of
our
world
toward
this
end
we
have
four
basic
objectives
tonight
first
steps
we
can
take
this
year
to
keep
our
economy
strong
and
growing
to
give
our
children
a
future
of
low
inflation
and
full
employment
second
lets
check
our
progress
in
attacking
social
problems
where
important
gains
have
been
made
but
which
still
need
critical
attention
i
mean
schools
that
work
economic
independence
for
the
poor
restoring
respect
for
family
life
and
family
values
our
third
objective
tonight
is
global
continuing
the
exciting
economic
and
democratic
revolutions
weve
seen
around
the
world
fourth
and
finally
our
nation
has
remained
at
peace
for
nearly
a
decade
and
a
half
as
we
move
toward
our
goals
of
world
prosperity
and
world
freedom
we
must
protect
that
peace
and
deter
war
by
making
sure
the
next
president
inherits
what
you
and
i
have
a
moral
obligation
to
give
that
president
a
national
security
that
is
unassailable
and
a
national
defense
that
takes
full
advantage
of
new
technology
and
is
fully
funded
this
is
a
full
agenda
its
meant
to
be
you
see
my
thinking
on
the
next
year
is
quite
simple
lets
make
this
the
best
of
and
that
means
its
all
outright
to
the
finish
line
i
dont
buy
the
idea
that
this
is
the
last
year
of
anything
because
were
not
talking
here
tonight
about
registering
temporary
gains
but
ways
of
making
permanent
our
successes
and
thats
why
our
focus
is
the
values
the
principles
and
ideas
that
made
america
great
lets
be
clear
on
this
point
were
for
limited
government
because
we
understand
as
the
founding
fathers
did
that
it
is
the
best
way
of
ensuring
personal
liberty
and
empowering
the
individual
so
that
every
american
of
every
race
and
region
shares
fully
in
the
flowering
of
american
prosperity
and
freedom
one
other
thing
we
americans
likethe
futurelike
the
sound
of
it
the
idea
of
it
the
hope
of
it
where
others
fear
trade
and
economic
growth
we
see
opportunities
for
creating
new
wealth
and
undreamedof
opportunities
for
millions
in
our
own
land
and
beyond
where
others
seek
to
throw
up
barriers
we
seek
to
bring
them
down
where
others
take
counsel
of
their
fears
we
follow
our
hopes
yes
we
americans
like
the
future
and
like
making
the
most
of
it
lets
do
that
now
and
lets
begin
by
discussing
how
to
maintain
economic
growth
by
controlling
and
eventually
eliminating
the
problem
of
federal
deficits
we
have
had
a
balanced
budget
only
eight
times
in
the
last
years
for
the
first
time
in
years
the
federal
government
spent
less
in
real
terms
last
year
than
the
year
before
we
took
billion
off
last
years
deficit
compared
to
the
year
before
the
deficit
itself
has
moved
from
percent
of
the
gross
national
product
to
only
percent
and
perhaps
the
most
important
sign
of
progress
has
been
the
change
in
our
view
of
deficits
you
know
a
few
of
us
can
remember
when
not
too
many
years
ago
those
who
created
the
deficits
said
they
would
make
us
prosperous
and
not
to
worry
about
the
debt
because
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
well
at
last
there
is
agreement
that
we
cant
spend
ourselves
rich
our
recent
budget
agreement
designed
to
reduce
federal
deficits
by
billion
over
the
next
years
builds
on
this
consensus
but
this
agreement
must
be
adhered
to
without
slipping
into
the
errors
of
the
past
more
broken
promises
and
more
unchecked
spending
as
i
indicated
in
my
first
state
of
the
union
what
ails
us
can
be
simply
put
the
federal
government
is
too
big
and
it
spends
too
much
money
i
can
assure
you
the
bipartisan
leadership
of
congress
of
my
help
in
fighting
off
any
attempt
to
bust
our
budget
agreement
and
this
includes
the
swift
and
certain
use
of
the
veto
power
now
its
also
time
for
some
plain
talk
about
the
most
immediate
obstacle
to
controlling
federal
deficits
the
simple
but
frustrating
problem
of
making
expenses
match
revenuessomething
american
families
do
and
the
federal
government
canthas
caused
crisis
after
crisis
in
this
city
mr
speaker
mr
president
i
will
say
to
you
tonight
what
i
have
said
before
and
will
continue
to
say
the
budget
process
has
broken
down
it
needs
a
drastic
overhaul
with
each
ensuing
year
the
spectacle
before
the
american
people
is
the
same
as
it
was
this
christmas
budget
deadlines
delayed
or
missed
completely
monstrous
continuing
resolutions
that
pack
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
spending
into
one
bill
and
a
federal
government
on
the
brink
of
default
i
know
im
echoing
what
you
here
in
the
congress
have
said
because
you
suffered
so
directly
but
lets
recall
that
in
years
of
appropriations
bills
scheduled
to
arrive
on
my
desk
by
a
certain
date
only
made
it
on
time
last
year
of
the
appropriations
bills
due
by
october
st
none
of
them
made
it
instead
we
had
four
continuing
resolutions
lasting
days
then
days
and
days
and
days
respectively
and
then
along
came
these
behemoths
this
is
the
conference
report
pages
report
weighing
pounds
then
thisa
reconciliation
bill
months
late
that
was
pages
long
weighing
pounds
and
the
longterm
continuing
resolutionthis
one
was
months
late
and
its
pages
long
weighing
pounds
that
was
a
total
of
pounds
of
paper
and
ink
you
had
hoursyes
hoursto
consider
each
and
it
took
people
at
my
office
of
management
and
budget
just
to
read
the
bill
so
the
government
wouldnt
shut
down
congress
shouldnt
send
another
one
of
these
no
and
if
you
do
i
will
not
sign
it
lets
change
all
this
instead
of
a
presidential
budget
that
gets
discarded
and
a
congressional
budget
resolution
that
is
not
enforced
why
not
a
simple
partnership
a
joint
agreement
that
sets
out
the
spending
priorities
within
the
available
revenues
and
lets
remember
our
deadline
is
october
st
not
christmas
lets
get
the
peoples
w
ork
done
in
time
to
avoid
a
footrace
with
santa
claus
and
yes
this
yearto
coin
a
phrasea
new
beginning
individual
bills
on
time
and
fully
reviewed
by
congress
im
also
certain
you
join
me
in
saying
lets
help
ensure
our
future
of
prosperity
by
giving
the
president
a
tool
that
though
i
will
not
get
to
use
it
is
one
i
know
future
presidents
of
either
party
must
have
give
the
president
the
same
authority
that
governors
use
in
their
states
the
right
to
reach
into
massive
appropriation
bills
pare
away
the
waste
and
enforce
budget
discipline
lets
approve
the
lineitem
veto
and
lets
take
a
partial
step
in
this
direction
most
of
you
in
this
chamber
didnt
know
what
was
in
this
catchall
bill
and
report
over
the
past
few
weeks
weve
all
learned
what
was
tucked
away
behind
a
little
comma
here
and
there
for
example
theres
millions
for
items
such
as
cranberry
research
blueberry
research
the
study
of
crawfish
and
the
commercialization
of
wildflowers
and
thats
not
to
mention
the
five
or
so
million
million
thatso
that
people
from
developing
nations
could
come
here
to
watch
congress
at
work
i
wont
even
touch
that
so
tonight
i
offer
you
this
challenge
in
days
i
will
send
back
to
you
those
items
as
rescissions
which
if
i
had
the
authority
to
line
them
out
i
would
do
so
now
review
this
multibilliondollar
package
that
will
not
undercut
our
bipartisan
budget
agreement
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
adopted
it
will
improve
our
deficit
reduction
goals
and
what
an
example
we
can
set
that
were
serious
about
getting
our
financial
accounts
in
order
by
acting
and
approving
this
plan
you
have
the
opportunity
to
override
a
congressional
process
that
is
out
of
control
there
is
another
vital
reform
yes
grammrudmanhollings
has
been
profoundly
helpful
but
let
us
take
its
goal
of
a
balanced
budget
and
make
it
permanent
let
us
do
now
what
so
many
states
do
to
hold
down
spending
and
what
state
legislatures
have
asked
us
to
do
let
us
heed
the
wishes
of
an
overwhelming
plurality
of
americans
and
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
that
mandates
a
balanced
budget
and
forces
the
federal
government
to
live
within
its
means
reform
of
the
budget
processincluding
the
lineitem
veto
and
balanced
budget
amendmentwill
together
with
real
restraint
on
government
spending
prevent
the
federal
budget
from
ever
again
ravaging
the
family
budget
lets
ensure
that
the
federal
government
never
again
legislates
against
the
family
and
the
home
last
september
signed
an
executive
order
on
the
family
requiring
that
every
department
and
agency
review
its
activities
in
light
of
seven
standards
designed
to
promote
and
not
harm
the
family
but
let
us
make
certain
that
the
family
is
always
at
the
center
of
the
public
policy
process
not
just
in
this
administration
but
in
all
future
administrations
its
time
for
congress
to
consider
at
the
beginning
a
statement
of
the
impact
that
legislation
will
have
on
the
basic
unit
of
american
society
the
family
and
speaking
of
the
family
lets
turn
to
a
matter
on
the
mind
of
every
american
parent
tonight
education
we
all
know
the
sorry
story
of
the
sixties
and
seventiessoaring
spending
plummeting
test
scoresand
that
hopeful
trend
of
the
eighties
when
we
replaced
an
obsession
with
dollars
with
a
commitment
to
quality
and
test
scores
started
back
up
theres
a
lesson
here
that
we
all
should
write
on
the
blackboard
a
hundred
times
in
a
childs
education
money
can
never
take
the
place
of
basics
like
discipline
hard
work
and
yes
homework
as
a
nation
we
do
of
course
spend
heavily
on
educationmore
than
we
spend
on
defense
yet
across
our
country
governors
like
new
jerseys
tom
kean
are
giving
classroom
demonstrations
that
how
we
spend
is
as
important
as
how
much
we
spend
opening
up
the
teaching
profession
to
all
qualified
candidates
merit
payso
that
good
teachers
get
as
as
well
as
applesand
stronger
curriculum
as
secretary
bennett
has
proposed
for
high
schoolsthese
imaginative
reforms
are
making
common
sense
the
most
popular
new
kid
in
americas
schools
how
can
we
help
well
we
can
talk
about
and
push
for
these
reforms
but
the
most
important
thing
we
can
do
is
to
reaffirm
that
control
of
our
schools
belongs
to
the
states
local
communities
and
most
of
all
to
the
parents
and
teachers
my
friends
some
years
ago
the
federal
government
declared
war
on
poverty
and
poverty
won
today
the
federal
government
has
major
welfare
programs
and
spends
more
than
billion
a
year
on
them
what
has
all
this
money
done
well
too
often
it
has
only
made
poverty
harder
to
escape
federal
welfare
programs
have
created
a
massive
social
problem
with
the
best
of
intentions
government
created
a
poverty
trap
that
wreaks
havoc
on
the
very
support
system
the
poor
need
most
to
lift
themselves
out
of
poverty
the
family
dependency
has
become
the
one
enduring
heirloom
passed
from
one
generation
to
the
next
of
too
many
fragmented
families
it
is
timethis
may
be
the
most
radical
thing
ive
said
in
years
in
this
officeits
time
for
washington
to
show
a
little
humility
there
are
a
thousand
sparks
of
genius
in
states
and
a
thousand
communities
around
the
nation
it
is
time
to
nurture
them
and
see
which
ones
can
catch
fire
and
become
guiding
lights
states
have
begun
to
show
us
the
way
theyve
demonstrated
that
successful
welfare
programs
can
be
built
around
more
effective
child
support
enforcement
practices
and
innovative
programs
requiring
welfare
recipients
to
work
or
prepare
for
work
let
us
give
the
states
more
flexibility
and
encourage
more
reforms
lets
start
making
our
welfare
system
the
first
rung
on
americas
ladder
of
opportunity
a
boost
up
from
dependency
not
a
graveyard
but
a
birthplace
of
hope
and
now
let
me
turn
to
three
other
matters
vital
to
family
values
and
the
quality
of
family
life
the
first
is
an
untold
american
success
story
recently
we
released
our
annual
survey
of
what
graduating
high
school
seniors
have
to
say
about
drugs
cocaine
use
is
declining
and
marijuana
use
was
the
lowest
since
surveying
began
we
can
be
proud
that
our
students
are
just
saying
no
to
drugs
but
let
us
remember
what
this
menace
requires
commitment
from
every
part
of
america
and
every
single
american
a
commitment
to
a
drugfree
america
the
war
against
drugs
is
a
war
of
individual
battles
a
crusade
with
many
heroes
including
americas
young
people
and
also
someone
very
special
to
me
she
has
helped
so
many
of
our
young
people
to
say
no
to
drugs
nancy
much
credit
belongs
to
you
and
i
want
to
express
to
you
your
husbands
pride
and
your
countrys
thanks
surprised
you
didnt
i
well
now
we
come
to
a
family
issue
that
we
must
have
the
courage
to
confront
tonight
i
call
americaa
good
nation
a
moral
peopleto
charitable
but
realistic
consideration
of
the
terrible
cost
of
abortion
on
demand
to
those
who
say
this
violates
a
womans
right
to
control
of
her
own
body
can
they
deny
that
now
medical
evidence
confirms
the
unborn
child
is
a
living
human
being
entitled
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
let
us
unite
as
a
nation
and
protect
the
unborn
with
legislation
that
would
stop
all
federal
funding
for
abortion
and
with
a
human
life
amendment
making
of
course
an
exception
where
the
unborn
child
threatens
the
life
of
the
mother
our
judeochristian
tradition
recognizes
the
right
of
taking
a
life
in
selfdefense
but
with
that
one
exception
let
us
look
to
those
others
in
our
land
who
cry
out
for
children
to
adopt
i
pledge
to
you
tonight
i
will
work
to
remove
barriers
to
adoption
and
extend
full
sharing
in
family
life
to
millions
of
americans
so
that
children
who
need
homes
can
be
welcomed
to
families
who
want
them
and
love
them
and
let
me
add
here
so
many
of
our
greatest
statesmen
have
reminded
us
that
spiritual
values
alone
are
essential
to
our
nations
health
and
vigor
the
congress
opens
its
proceedings
each
day
as
does
the
supreme
court
with
an
acknowledgment
of
the
supreme
being
yet
we
are
denied
the
right
to
set
aside
in
our
schools
a
moment
each
day
for
those
who
wish
to
pray
i
believe
congress
should
pass
our
school
prayer
amendment
now
to
make
sure
there
is
a
full
nine
member
supreme
court
to
interpret
the
law
to
protect
the
rights
of
all
americans
i
urge
the
senate
to
move
quickly
and
decisively
in
confirming
judge
anthony
kennedy
to
the
highest
court
in
the
land
and
to
also
confirm
nominees
now
waiting
to
fill
vacancies
in
the
federal
judiciary
here
then
are
our
domestic
priorities
yet
if
the
congress
and
the
administration
work
together
even
greater
opportunities
lie
ahead
to
expand
a
growing
world
economy
to
continue
to
reduce
the
threat
of
nuclear
arms
and
to
extend
the
frontiers
of
freedom
and
the
growth
of
democratic
institutions
our
policies
consistently
received
the
strongest
support
of
the
late
congressman
dan
daniel
of
virginia
im
sure
all
of
you
join
me
in
expressing
heartfelt
condolences
on
his
passing
one
of
the
greatest
contributions
the
united
states
can
make
to
the
world
is
to
promote
freedom
as
the
key
to
economic
growth
a
creative
competitive
america
is
the
answer
to
a
changing
world
not
trade
wars
that
would
close
doors
create
greater
barriers
and
destroy
millions
of
jobs
we
should
always
remember
protectionism
is
destructionism
americas
jobs
americas
growth
americas
future
depend
on
tradetrade
that
is
free
open
and
fair
this
year
we
have
it
within
our
power
to
take
a
major
step
toward
a
growing
global
economy
and
an
expanding
cycle
of
prosperity
that
reaches
to
all
the
free
nations
of
this
earth
im
speaking
of
the
historic
free
trade
agreement
negotiated
between
our
country
and
canada
and
i
can
also
tell
you
that
were
determined
to
expand
this
concept
south
as
well
as
north
next
month
i
will
be
traveling
to
mexico
where
trade
matters
will
be
of
foremost
concern
and
over
the
next
several
months
our
congress
and
the
canadian
parliament
can
make
the
start
of
such
a
north
american
accord
a
reality
our
goal
must
be
a
day
when
the
free
flow
of
trade
from
the
tip
of
tierra
del
fuego
to
the
arctic
circle
unites
the
people
of
the
western
hemisphere
in
a
bond
of
mutually
beneficial
exchange
when
all
borders
become
what
the
uscanadian
b
order
so
long
has
been
a
meeting
place
rather
than
a
dividing
line
this
movement
we
see
in
so
many
places
toward
economic
freedom
is
indivisible
from
the
worldwide
movement
toward
political
freedom
and
against
totalitarian
rule
this
global
democratic
revolution
has
removed
the
specter
so
frightening
a
decade
ago
of
democracy
doomed
to
permanent
minority
status
in
the
world
in
south
and
central
america
only
a
third
of
the
people
enjoyed
democratic
rule
in
today
over
percent
of
latin
americans
live
in
nations
committed
to
democratic
principles
and
the
resurgence
of
democracy
is
owed
to
these
courageous
people
on
almost
every
continent
who
have
struggled
to
take
control
of
their
own
destiny
in
nicaragua
the
struggle
has
extra
meaning
because
that
nation
is
so
near
our
own
borders
the
recent
revelations
of
a
former
highlevel
sandinista
major
roger
miranda
show
us
that
even
as
they
talk
peace
the
communist
sandinista
government
of
nicaragua
has
established
plans
for
a
large
man
army
yet
even
as
these
plans
are
made
the
sandinista
regime
knows
the
tide
is
turning
and
the
cause
of
nicaraguan
freedom
is
riding
at
its
crest
because
of
the
freedom
fighters
who
are
resisting
communist
rule
the
sandinistas
have
been
forced
to
extend
some
democratic
rights
negotiate
with
church
authorities
and
release
a
few
political
prisoners
the
focus
is
on
the
sandinistas
their
promises
and
their
actions
there
is
a
consensus
among
the
four
central
american
democratic
presidents
that
the
sandinistas
have
not
complied
with
the
plan
to
bring
peace
and
democracy
to
all
of
central
america
the
sandinistas
again
have
promised
reforms
their
challenge
is
to
take
irreversible
steps
toward
democracy
on
wednesday
my
request
to
sustain
the
freedom
fighters
will
be
submitted
which
reflects
our
mutual
desire
for
peace
freedom
and
democracy
in
nicaragua
i
ask
congress
to
pass
this
request
let
us
be
for
the
people
of
nicaragua
what
lafayette
pulaski
and
von
steuben
were
for
our
forefathers
and
the
cause
of
american
independence
so
too
in
afghanistan
the
freedom
fighters
are
the
key
to
peace
we
support
the
mujahidin
there
can
be
no
settlement
unless
all
soviet
troops
are
removed
and
the
afghan
people
are
allowed
genuine
selfdetermination
i
have
made
my
views
on
this
matter
known
to
mr
gorbachev
but
not
just
nicaragua
or
afghanistanyes
everywhere
we
see
a
swelling
freedom
tide
across
the
world
freedom
fighters
rising
up
in
cambodia
and
angola
fighting
and
dying
for
the
same
democratic
liberties
we
hold
sacred
their
cause
is
our
cause
freedom
yet
even
as
we
work
to
expand
world
freedom
we
must
build
a
safer
peace
and
reduce
the
danger
of
nuclear
war
but
lets
have
no
illusions
three
years
of
steady
decline
in
the
value
of
our
annual
defense
investment
have
increased
the
risk
of
our
most
basic
security
interests
jeopardizing
earlier
hardwon
goals
we
must
face
squarely
the
implications
of
this
negative
trend
and
make
adequate
stable
defense
spending
a
top
goal
both
this
year
and
in
the
future
this
same
concern
applies
to
economic
and
security
assistance
programs
as
well
but
the
resolve
of
america
and
its
nato
allies
has
opened
the
way
for
unprecedented
achievement
in
arms
reduction
our
recently
signed
inf
treaty
is
historic
because
it
reduces
nuclear
arms
and
establishes
the
most
stringent
verification
regime
in
arms
control
history
including
several
forms
of
shortnotice
onsite
inspection
i
submitted
the
treaty
today
and
i
urge
the
senate
to
give
its
advice
and
consent
to
ratification
of
this
landmark
agreement
thank
you
very
much
in
addition
to
the
inf
treaty
were
within
reach
of
an
even
more
significant
start
agreement
that
will
reduce
us
and
soviet
longrange
missileor
strategic
arsenals
by
half
but
let
me
be
clear
our
approach
is
not
to
seek
agreement
for
agreements
sake
but
to
settle
only
for
agreements
that
truly
enhance
our
national
security
and
that
of
our
allies
we
will
never
put
our
security
at
riskor
that
of
our
alliesjust
to
reach
an
agreement
with
the
soviets
no
agreement
is
better
than
a
bad
agreement
as
i
mentioned
earlier
our
efforts
are
to
give
future
generations
what
we
never
hada
future
free
of
nuclear
terror
reduction
of
strategic
offensive
arms
is
one
step
sdi
another
our
funding
request
for
our
strategic
defense
initiative
is
less
than
percent
of
the
total
defense
budget
sdi
funding
is
money
wisely
appropriated
and
money
well
spent
sdi
has
the
same
purpose
and
supports
the
same
goals
of
arms
reduction
it
reduces
the
risk
of
war
and
the
threat
of
nuclear
weapons
to
all
mankind
strategic
defenses
that
threaten
no
one
could
offer
the
world
a
safer
more
stable
basis
for
deterrence
we
must
also
remember
that
sdi
is
our
insurance
policy
against
a
nuclear
accident
a
chernobyl
of
the
sky
or
an
accidental
launch
or
some
madman
who
might
come
along
weve
seen
such
changes
in
the
world
in
years
as
totalitarianism
struggles
to
avoid
being
overwhelmed
by
the
forces
of
economic
advance
and
the
aspiration
for
human
freedom
it
is
the
free
nations
that
are
resilient
and
resurgent
as
the
global
democratic
revolution
has
put
totalitarianism
on
the
defensive
we
have
left
behind
the
days
of
retreat
america
is
again
a
vigorous
leader
of
the
free
world
a
nation
that
acts
decisively
and
firmly
in
the
furtherance
of
her
principles
and
vital
interests
no
legacy
would
make
me
more
proud
than
leaving
in
place
a
bipartisan
consensus
for
the
cause
of
world
freedom
a
consensus
that
prevents
a
paralysis
of
american
power
from
ever
occurring
again
but
my
thoughts
tonight
go
beyond
this
and
i
hope
youll
let
me
end
this
evening
with
a
personal
reflection
you
know
the
world
could
never
be
quite
the
same
again
after
jacob
shallus
a
trustworthy
and
dependable
clerk
of
the
pennsylvania
general
assembly
took
his
pen
and
engrossed
those
words
about
representative
government
in
the
preamble
of
our
constitution
and
in
a
quiet
but
final
way
the
course
of
human
events
was
forever
altered
when
on
a
ridge
overlooking
the
emmitsburg
pike
in
an
obscure
pennsylvania
town
called
gettysburg
lincoln
spoke
of
our
duty
to
government
of
and
by
the
people
and
never
letting
it
perish
from
the
earth
at
the
start
of
this
decade
i
suggested
that
we
live
in
equally
momentous
times
that
it
is
up
to
us
now
to
decide
whether
our
form
of
government
would
endure
and
whether
history
still
had
a
place
of
greatness
for
a
quiet
pleasant
greening
land
called
america
not
everything
has
been
made
perfect
in
years
nor
will
it
be
made
perfect
in
seven
times
years
but
before
us
this
year
and
beyond
are
great
prospects
for
the
cause
of
peace
and
world
freedom
it
means
too
that
the
young
americans
i
spoke
of
years
ago
as
well
as
those
who
might
be
coming
along
the
virginia
or
maryland
shores
this
night
and
seeing
for
the
first
time
the
lights
of
this
capital
citythe
lights
that
cast
their
glow
on
our
great
halls
of
government
and
the
monuments
to
the
memory
of
our
great
menit
means
those
young
americans
will
find
a
city
of
hope
in
a
land
that
is
free
we
can
be
proud
that
for
them
and
for
us
as
those
lights
along
the
potomac
are
still
seen
this
night
signaling
as
they
have
for
nearly
two
centuries
and
as
we
pray
god
they
always
will
that
another
generation
of
americans
has
protected
and
passed
on
lovingly
this
place
called
america
this
shining
city
on
a
hill
this
government

the

guided
forever
by
their
words
now
forgive
me
but
i
cant
resist
sharing
a
story
from
those
historic
days
philadelphia
was
bursting
with
civic
pride
in
the
spring
of
and
its
newspapers
began
embellishing
the
arrival
of
the
convention
delegates
with
elaborate
social
classifications
governors
of
states
were
called
excellency
justices
and
chancellors
had
reserved
for
them
honorable
with
a
capital
h
for
congressmen
it
was
honorable
with
a
small
h
and
all
others
were
referred
to
as
the
following
respectable
characters
well
for
this
th
congress
i
invoke
special
executive
powers
to
declare
that
each
of
you
must
never
be
titled
less
than
honorable
with
a
capital
h
incidentally
im
delighted
you
are
celebrating
the
th
birthday
of
the
congress
its
always
a
pleasure
to
congratulate
someone
with
more
birthdays
than
ive
had
now
theres
a
new
face
at
this
place
of
honor
tonight
and
please
join
me
in
warm
congratulations
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
jim
wright
mr
speaker
you
might
recall
a
similar
situation
in
your
very
first
session
of
congress
years
ago
then
as
now
the
speakership
had
changed
hands
and
another
great
son
of
texas
sam
rayburnmr
samsat
in
your
chair
i
cannot
find
better
words
than
those
used
by
president
eisenhower
that
evening
he
said
we
shall
have
much
to
do
together
i
am
sure
that
we
will
get
it
done
and
that
we
shall
do
it
in
harmony
and
good
will
tonight
i
renew
that
pledge
to
you
mr
speaker
and
to
senate
majority
leader
robert
byrd
who
brings
years
of
distinguished
service
to
the
congress
may
i
say
though
there
are
changes
in
the
congress
americas
interests
remain
the
same
and
i
am
confident
that
along
with
republican
leaders
bob
michel
and
bob
dole
this
congress
can
make
history
six
years
ago
i
was
here
to
ask
the
congress
to
join
me
in
americas
new
beginning
well
the
results
are
something
of
which
we
can
all
be
proud
our
inflation
rate
is
now
the
lowest
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
prime
interest
rate
has
fallen
from
the
percent
the
month
before
we
took
office
to
percent
today
and
those
rates
have
triggered
the
most
housing
starts
in
years
the
unemployment
ratestill
too
highis
the
lowest
in
nearly
years
and
our
people
have
created
nearly
million
new
jobs
over
percent
of
everyone
over
the
age
of
male
and
female
is
employedthe
highest
percentage
on
record
lets
roll
up
our
sleeves
and
go
to
work
and
put
americas
economic
engine
at
full
throttle
we
can
also
be
heartened
by
our
progress
across
the
world
most
important
america
is
at
peace
tonight
and
freedom
is
on
the
march
and
weve
done
much
these
past
years
to
restore
our
defenses
our
alliances
and
our
leadership
in
the
world
our
sons
and
daughters
in
the
services
once
again
wear
their
uniforms
with
pride
but
though
weve
made
much
progress
i
have
one
major
regret
i
took
a
risk
with
regard
to
our
action
in
iran
it
did
not
work
and
for
that
i
assume
full
responsibility
the
goals
were
worthy
i
do
not
believe
it
was
wrong
to
try
to
establish
contacts
with
a
country
of
strategic
importance
or
to
try
to
save
lives
and
certainly
it
was
not
wrong
to
try
to
secure
freedom
for
our
citizens
held
in
barbaric
captivity
but
we
did
not
achieve
what
we
wished
and
serious
mistakes
were
made
in
trying
to
do
so
we
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
and
i
will
take
whatever
action
is
called
for
but
in
debating
the
past
we
must
not
deny
ourselves
the
successes
of
the
future
let
it
never
be
said
of
this
generation
of
americans
that
we
became
so
obsessed
with
failure
that
we
refused
to
take
risks
that
could
further
the
cause
of
peace
and
freedom
in
the
world
much
is
at
stake
here
and
the
nation
and
the
world
are
watching
to
see
if
we
go
forward
together
in
the
national
interest
or
if
we
let
partisanship
weaken
us
and
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
american
policy
we
will
not
sit
idly
by
if
our
interests
or
our
friends
in
the
middle
east
are
threatened
nor
will
we
yield
to
terrorist
blackmail
and
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
congress
why
dont
we
get
to
work
i
am
pleased
to
report
that
because
of
our
efforts
to
rebuild
the
strength
of
america
the
world
is
a
safer
place
earlier
this
month
i
submitted
a
budget
to
defend
america
and
maintain
our
momentum
to
make
up
for
neglect
in
the
last
decade
well
i
ask
you
to
vote
out
a
defense
and
foreign
affairs
budget
that
says
yes
to
protecting
our
country
while
the
world
is
safer
it
is
not
safe
since
the
soviets
have
invested
billion
more
on
their
military
forces
than
we
have
even
today
though
nearly
in
soviet
families
is
without
running
hot
water
and
the
average
family
spends
hours
a
day
shopping
for
the
basic
necessities
of
life
their
government
still
found
the
resources
to
transfer
billion
in
weapons
to
client
states
in
the
past
yearsclients
like
syria
vietnam
cuba
libya
angola
ethiopia
afghanistan
and
nicaragua
with
soviet
combat
and
military
personnel
and
military
advisers
in
asia
africa
and
latin
america
can
anyone
still
doubt
their
singleminded
determination
to
expand
their
power
despite
this
the
congress
cut
my
request
for
critical
us
security
assistance
to
free
nations
by
percent
this
year
and
cut
defense
requests
by
billion
in
the
last
years
these
assistance
programs
serve
our
national
interests
as
well
as
mutual
interests
and
when
the
programs
are
devastated
american
interests
are
harmed
my
friends
its
my
duty
as
president
to
say
to
you
again
tonight
that
there
is
no
surer
way
to
lose
freedom
than
to
lose
our
resolve
today
the
brave
people
of
afghanistan
are
showing
that
resolve
the
soviet
union
says
it
wants
a
peaceful
settlement
in
afghanistan
yet
it
continues
a
brutal
war
and
props
up
a
regime
whose
days
are
clearly
numbered
we
are
ready
to
support
a
political
solution
that
guarantees
the
rapid
withdrawal
of
all
soviet
troops
and
genuine
selfdetermination
for
the
afghan
people
in
central
america
too
the
cause
of
freedom
is
being
tested
and
our
resolve
is
being
tested
there
as
well
here
especially
the
world
is
watching
to
see
how
this
nation
responds
today
over
percent
of
the
people
of
latin
america
live
in
democracy
democracy
is
on
the
march
in
central
and
south
america
communist
nicaragua
is
the
odd
man
outsuppressing
the
church
the
press
and
democratic
dissent
and
promoting
subversion
in
the
region
we
support
diplomatic
efforts
but
these
efforts
can
never
succeed
if
the
sandinistas
win
their
war
against
the
nicaraguan
people
our
commitment
to
a
western
hemisphere
safe
from
aggression
did
not
occur
by
spontaneous
generation
on
the
day
that
we
took
office
it
began
with
the
monroe
doctrine
in
and
continues
our
historic
bipartisan
american
policy
franklin
roosevelt
said
we
are
determined
to
do
everything
possible
to
maintain
peace
on
this
hemisphere
president
truman
was
very
blunt
international
communism
seeks
to
crush
and
undermine
and
destroy
the
independence
of
the
americas
we
cannot
let
that
happen
here
and
john
f
kennedy
made
clear
that
communist
domination
in
this
hemisphere
can
never
be
negotiated
some
in
this
congress
may
choose
to
depart
from
this
historic
commitment
but
i
will
not
this
year
we
celebrate
the
second
century
of
our
constitution
the
sandinistas
just
signed
theirs
weeks
ago
and
then
suspended
it
we
wont
know
how
my
words
tonight
will
be
reported
there
for
one
simple
reason
there
is
no
free
press
in
nicaragua
nicaraguan
freedom
fighters
have
never
asked
us
to
wage
their
battle
but
i
will
fight
any
effort
to
shut
off
their
lifeblood
and
consign
them
to
death
defeat
or
a
life
without
freedom
there
must
be
no
soviet
beachhead
in
central
america
you
know
we
americans
have
always
preferred
dialog
to
conflict
and
so
we
always
remain
open
to
more
constructive
relations
with
the
soviet
union
but
more
responsible
soviet
conduct
around
the
world
is
a
key
element
of
the
ussoviet
agenda
progress
is
also
required
on
the
other
items
of
our
agenda
as
wellreal
respect
for
human
rights
and
more
open
contacts
between
our
societies
and
of
course
arms
reduction
in
iceland
last
october
we
had
one
moment
of
opportunity
that
the
soviets
dashed
because
they
sought
to
cripple
our
strategic
defense
initiative
sdi
i
wouldnt
let
them
do
it
then
i
wont
let
them
do
it
now
or
in
the
future
this
is
the
most
positive
and
promising
defense
program
we
have
undertaken
its
the
path
for
both
sides
to
a
safer
futurea
system
that
defends
human
life
instead
of
threatening
it
sdi
will
go
forward
the
united
states
has
made
serious
fair
and
farreaching
proposals
to
the
soviet
union
and
this
is
a
moment
of
rare
opportunity
for
arms
reduction
but
i
will
need
and
american
negotiators
in
geneva
will
need
congress
support
enacting
the
soviet
negotiating
position
into
american
law
would
not
be
the
way
to
win
a
good
agreement
so
i
must
tell
you
in
this
congress
i
will
veto
any
effort
that
undercuts
our
national
security
and
our
negotiating
leverage
now
today
we
also
find
ourselves
engaged
in
expanding
peaceful
commerce
across
the
world
we
will
work
to
expand
our
opportunities
in
international
markets
through
the
uruguay
round
of
trade
negotiations
and
to
complete
an
historic
free
trade
arrangement
between
the
worlds
two
largest
trading
partners
canada
and
the
united
states
our
basic
trade
policy
remains
the
same
we
remain
opposed
as
ever
to
protectionism
because
americas
growth
and
future
depend
on
trade
but
we
would
insist
on
trade
that
is
fair
and
free
we
are
always
willing
to
be
trade
partners
but
never
trade
patsies
now
from
foreign
borders
let
us
ret
urn
to
our
own
because
america
in
the
world
is
only
as
strong
as
america
at
home
this
th
congress
has
high
responsibilities
i
begin
with
a
gentle
reminder
that
many
of
these
are
simply
the
incomplete
obligations
of
the
past
the
american
people
deserve
to
be
impatient
because
we
do
not
yet
have
the
public
house
in
order
weve
had
great
success
in
restoring
our
economic
integrity
and
weve
rescued
our
nation
from
the
worst
economic
mess
since
the
depression
but
theres
more
to
do
for
starters
the
federal
deficit
is
outrageous
for
years
ive
asked
that
we
stop
pushing
onto
our
children
the
excesses
of
our
government
and
what
the
congress
finally
needs
to
do
is
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
that
mandates
a
balanced
budget
and
forces
government
to
live
within
its
means
states
cities
and
the
families
of
america
balance
their
budgets
why
cant
we
next
the
budget
process
is
a
sorry
spectacle
the
missing
of
deadlines
and
the
nightmare
of
monstrous
continuing
resolutions
packing
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
spending
into
one
bill
must
be
stopped
we
ask
the
congress
once
again
give
us
the
same
tool
that
governors
havea
lineitem
veto
so
we
can
carve
out
the
boondoggles
and
pork
those
items
that
would
never
survive
on
their
own
i
will
send
the
congress
broad
recommendations
on
the
budget
but
first
id
like
to
see
yours
lets
go
to
work
and
get
this
done
together
but
now
lets
talk
about
this
years
budget
even
though
i
have
submitted
it
within
the
grammrudmanhollings
deficit
reduction
target
i
have
seen
suggestions
that
we
might
postpone
that
timetable
well
i
think
the
american
people
are
tired
of
hearing
the
same
old
excuses
together
we
made
a
commitment
to
balance
the
budget
now
lets
keep
it
as
for
those
suggestions
that
the
answer
is
higher
taxes
the
american
people
have
repeatedly
rejected
that
shopworn
advice
they
know
that
we
dont
have
deficits
because
people
are
taxed
too
little
we
have
deficits
because
big
government
spends
too
much
now
next
month
ill
place
two
additional
reforms
before
the
congress
weve
created
a
welfare
monster
that
is
a
shocking
indictment
of
our
sense
of
priorities
our
national
welfare
system
consists
of
some
major
programs
and
over
pages
of
federal
laws
and
regulations
on
which
more
than
billion
was
spent
in
i
will
propose
a
new
national
welfare
strategy
a
program
of
welfare
reform
through
statesponsored
communitybased
demonstration
projects
this
is
the
time
to
reform
this
outmoded
social
dinosaur
and
finally
break
the
poverty
trap
now
we
will
never
abandon
those
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
must
have
our
help
but
let
us
work
to
see
how
many
can
be
freed
from
the
dependency
of
welfare
and
made
selfsupporting
which
the
great
majority
of
welfare
recipients
want
more
than
anything
else
next
let
us
remove
a
financial
specter
facing
our
older
americans
the
fear
of
an
illness
so
expensive
that
it
can
result
in
having
to
make
an
intolerable
choice
between
bankruptcy
and
death
i
will
submit
legislation
shortly
to
help
free
the
elderly
from
the
fear
of
catastrophic
illness
now
lets
turn
to
the
future
its
widely
said
that
america
is
losing
her
competitive
edge
well
that
wont
happen
if
we
act
now
how
well
prepared
are
we
to
enter
the
st
century
in
my
lifetime
america
set
the
standard
for
the
world
it
is
now
time
to
determine
that
we
should
enter
the
next
century
having
achieved
a
level
of
excellence
unsurpassed
in
history
we
will
achieve
this
first
by
guaranteeing
that
government
does
everything
possible
to
promote
americas
ability
to
compete
second
we
must
act
as
individuals
in
a
quest
for
excellence
that
will
not
be
measured
by
new
proposals
or
billions
in
new
funding
rather
it
involves
an
expenditure
of
american
spirit
and
just
plain
american
grit
the
congress
will
soon
receive
my
comprehensive
proposals
to
enhance
our
competitiveness
including
new
science
and
technology
centers
and
strong
new
funding
for
basic
research
the
bill
will
include
legal
and
regulatory
reforms
and
weapons
to
fight
unfair
trade
practices
competitiveness
also
means
giving
our
farmers
a
shot
at
participating
fairly
and
fully
in
a
changing
world
market
preparing
for
the
future
must
begin
as
always
with
our
children
we
need
to
set
for
them
new
and
more
rigorous
goals
we
must
demand
more
of
ourselves
and
our
children
by
raising
literacy
levels
dramatically
by
the
year
our
children
should
master
the
basic
concepts
of
math
and
science
and
lets
insist
that
students
not
leave
high
school
until
they
have
studied
and
understood
the
basic
documents
of
our
national
heritage
theres
one
more
thing
we
cant
let
up
on
lets
redouble
our
personal
efforts
to
provide
for
every
child
a
safe
and
drugfree
learning
environment
if
our
crusade
against
drugs
succeeds
with
our
children
we
will
defeat
that
scourge
all
over
the
country
finally
lets
stop
suppressing
the
spiritual
core
of
our
national
being
our
nation
could
not
have
been
conceived
without
divine
help
why
is
it
that
we
can
build
a
nation
with
our
prayers
but
we
cant
use
a
schoolroom
for
voluntary
prayer
the
th
congress
of
the
united
states
should
be
remembered
as
the
one
that
ended
the
expulsion
of
god
from
americas
classrooms
the
quest
for
excellence
into
the
st
century
begins
in
the
schoolroom
but
must
go
next
to
the
workplace
more
than
million
new
jobs
will
be
created
before
the
new
century
unfolds
and
by
then
our
economy
should
be
able
to
provide
a
job
for
everyone
who
wants
to
work
we
must
also
enable
our
workers
to
adapt
to
the
rapidly
changing
nature
of
the
workplace
and
i
will
propose
substantial
new
federal
commitments
keyed
to
retraining
and
job
mobility
over
the
next
few
weeks
ill
be
sending
the
congress
a
complete
series
of
these
special
messageson
budget
reform
welfare
reform
competitiveness
including
education
trade
worker
training
and
assistance
agriculture
and
other
subjects
the
congress
can
give
us
these
tools
but
to
make
these
tools
work
it
really
comes
down
to
just
being
our
best
and
that
is
the
core
of
american
greatness
the
responsibility
of
freedom
presses
us
towards
higher
knowledge
and
i
believe
moral
and
spiritual
greatness
through
lower
taxes
and
smaller
government
government
has
its
ways
of
freeing
peoples
spirits
but
only
we
each
of
us
can
let
the
spirit
soar
against
our
own
individual
standards
excellence
is
what
makes
freedom
ring
and
isnt
that
what
we
do
best
were
entering
our
third
century
now
but
its
wrong
to
judge
our
nation
by
its
years
the
calendar
cant
measure
america
because
we
were
meant
to
be
an
endless
experiment
in
freedomwith
no
limit
to
our
reaches
no
boundaries
to
what
we
can
do
no
end
point
to
our
hopes
the
united
states
constitution
is
the
impassioned
and
inspired
vehicle
by
which
we
travel
through
history
it
grew
out
of
the
most
fundamental
inspiration
of
our
existence
that
we
are
here
to
serve
him
by
living
freethat
living
free
releases
in
us
the
noblest
of
impulses
and
the
best
of
our
abilities
that
we
would
use
these
gifts
for
good
and
generous
purposes
and
would
secure
them
not
just
for
ourselves
and
for
our
children
but
for
all
mankind
over
the
yearsi
wont
count
if
you
dontnothing
has
been
so
heartwarming
to
me
as
speaking
to
americas
young
and
the
little
ones
especially
so
freshfaced
and
so
eager
to
know
well
from
time
to
time
ive
been
with
themthey
will
ask
about
our
constitution
and
i
hope
you
members
of
congress
will
not
deem
this
a
breach
of
protocol
if
youll
permit
me
to
share
these
thoughts
again
with
the
young
people
who
might
be
listening
or
watching
this
evening
ive
read
the
constitutions
of
a
number
of
countries
including
the
soviet
unions
now
some
people
are
surprised
to
hear
that
they
have
a
constitution
and
it
even
supposedly
grants
a
number
of
freedoms
to
its
people
many
countries
have
written
into
their
constitution
provisions
for
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
assembly
well
if
this
is
true
why
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
so
exceptional
well
the
difference
is
so
small
that
it
almost
escapes
you
but
its
so
great
it
tells
you
the
whole
story
in
just
three
words
we
the
people
in
those
other
constitutions
the
government
tells
the
people
of
those
countries
what
theyre
allowed
to
do
in
our
constitution
we
the
people
tell
the
government
what
it
can
do
and
it
can
do
only
those
things
listed
in
that
document
and
no
others
virtually
every
other
revolution
in
history
has
just
exchanged
one
set
of
rulers
for
another
set
of
rulers
our
revolution
is
the
first
to
say
the
people
are
the
masters
and
government
is
their
servant
and
you
young
people
out
there
dont
ever
forget
that
someday
you
could
be
in
this
room
but
wherever
you
are
america
is
depending
on
you
to
reach
your
highest
and
be
your
bestbecause
here
in
america
we
the
people
are
in
charge
just
three
words
we
the
peoplethose
are
the
kids
on
christmas
day
looking
out
from
a
frozen
sentry
post
on
the
th
parallel
in
korea
or
aboard
an
aircraft
carrier
in
the
mediterranean
a
million
miles
from
home
but
doing
their
duty
we
the
peoplethose
are
the
warmhearted
whose
numbers
we
cant
begin
to
count
wholl
begin
the
day
with
a
little
prayer
for
hostages
they
will
never
know
and
mia
families
they
will
never
meet
why
because
thats
the
way
we
are
this
unique
breed
we
call
americans
we
the
peopletheyre
farmers
on
tough
times
but
who
never
stop
feeding
a
hungry
world
theyre
the
volunteers
at
the
hospital
choking
back
their
tears
for
the
hundredth
time
caring
for
a
baby
struggling
for
life
because
of
a
mother
who
used
drugs
and
youll
forgive
me
a
special
memoryits
a
million
mothers
like
nelle
reagan
who
never
knew
a
stranger
or
turned
a
hungry
person
away
from
her
kitchen
door
we
the
peoplethey
refute
last
weeks
television
commentary
downgrading
our
optimism
and
our
idealism
they
are
the
entrepreneurs
the
builders
the
pioneers
and
a
lot
of
regular
folksthe
true
heroes
of
our
land
who
make
up
the
most
uncommon
nation
of
doers
in
history
you
know
theyre
americans
because
their
spirit
is
as
big
as
the
universe
and
their
hearts
are
bigger
than
their
spirits
we
the
peoplestarting
the

third
century
of
a
dream
and
standing
up
to
some
cynic
whos
trying
to
tell
us
were
not
going
to
get
any
better
are
we
at
the
end
well
i
cant
tell
it
any
better
than
the
real
thinga
story
recorded
by
james
madison
from
the
final
moments
of
the
constitutional
convention
september
th
as
the
last
few
members
signed
the
document
benjamin
franklinthe
oldest
delegate
at
years
and
in
frail
healthlooked
over
toward
the
chair
where
george
washington
daily
presided
at
the
back
of
the
chair
was
painted
the
picture
of
a
sun
on
the
horizon
and
turning
to
those
sitting
next
to
him
franklin
observed
that
artists
found
it
difficult
in
their
painting
to
distinguish
between
a
rising
and
a
setting
sun
well
i
know
if
we
were
there
we
could
see
those
delegates
sitting
around
franklinleaning
in
to
listen
more
closely
to
him
and
then
dr
franklin
began
to
share
his
deepest
hopes
and
fears
about
the
outcome
of
their
efforts
and
this
is
what
he
said
i
have
often
looked
at
that
picture
behind
the
president
without
being
able
to
tell
whether
it
was
a
rising
or
setting
sun
but
now
at
length
i
have
the
happiness
to
know
that
it
is
a
rising
and
not
a
setting
sun
well
you
can
bet
its
rising
because
my
fellow
citizens
america
isnt
finished
her
best
days
have
just
begun
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
america

do

forward

reach
for
the
stars

to
set
our
sights
on
the
future
i
am
pleased

state
of
our
union
is
stronger
than
a
year

and
growing
stronger
each
day
tonight
we
look
out
on
a
rising
america
firm
of
heart
united
in
spirit
powerful
in
pride
and
patriotism
america
is
on
the
move
but
it
wasnt
long
ago
that
we
looked
out
on
a
different
land
locked
factory
gates
long
gasoline
lines
intolerable
prices
and
interest
rates
turning
the
greatest
country
on
earth
into
a
land
of
broken
dreams
government
growing
beyond
our
consent
had
become
a
lumbering
giant
slamming
shut
the
gates
of
opportunity
threatening
to
crush
the
very
roots
of
our
freedom
what
brought
america
back
the
american
people
brought
us
back
with
quiet
courage
and
common
sense
with
undying
faith
that
in
this
nation
under
god
the
future
will
be
ours
for
the
future
belongs
to
the
free
tonight
the
american
people
deserve
our
thanks
for
straight
months
of
economic
growth
for
sunrise
firms
and
modernized
industries
creating
million
new
jobs
in
years
interest
rates
cut
in
half
inflation
falling
over
from
percent
in
to
under
today
and
a
mighty
river
of
good
worksa
record
billion
in
voluntary
giving
just
last
year
alone
and
despite
the
pressures
of
our
modern
world
family
and
community
remain
the
moral
core
of
our
society
guardians
of
our
values
and
hopes
for
the
future
family
and
community
are
the
costars
of
this
great
american
comeback
they
are
why
we
say
tonight
private
values
must
be
at
the
heart
of
public
policies
what
is
true
for
families
in
america
is
true
for
america
in
the
family
of
free
nations
history
is
no
captive
of
some
inevitable
force
history
is
made
by
men
and
women
of
vision
and
courage
tonight
freedom
is
on
the
march
the
united
states
is
the
economic
miracle
the
model
to
which
the
world
once
again
turns
we
stand
for
an
idea
whose
time
is
now
only
by
lifting
the
weights
from
the
shoulders
of
all
can
people
truly
prosper
and
can
peace
among
all
nations
be
secure
teddy
roosevelt
said
that
a
nation
that
does
great
work
lives
forever
we
have
done
well
but
we
cannot
stop
at
the
foothills
when
everest
beckons
its
time
for
america
to
be
all
that
we
can
be
we
speak
tonight
of
an
agenda
for
the
future
an
agenda
for
a
safer
more
secure
world
and
we
speak
about
the
necessity
for
actions
to
steel
us
for
the
challenges
of
growth
trade
and
security
in
the
next
decade
and
the
year
and
we
will
do
itnot
by
breaking
faith
with
bedrock
principles
but
by
breaking
free
from
failed
policies
let
us
begin
where
storm
clouds
loom
darkestright
here
in
washington
dc
this
week
i
will
send
you
our
detailed
proposals
tonight
let
us
speak
of
our
responsibility
to
redefine
governments
role
not
to
control
not
to
demand
or
command
not
to
contain
us
but
to
help
in
times
of
need
and
above
all
to
create
a
ladder
of
opportunity
to
full
employment
so
that
all
americans
can
climb
toward
economic
power
and
justice
on
their
own
but
we
cannot
win
the
race
to
the
future
shackled
to
a
system
that
cant
even
pass
a
federal
budget
we
cannot
win
that
race
held
back
by
horseandbuggy
programs
that
waste
tax
dollars
and
squander
human
potential
we
cannot
win
that
race
if
were
swamped
in
a
sea
of
red
ink
now
mr
speaker
you
know
i
know
and
the
american
people
know
the
federal
budget
system
is
broken
it
doesnt
work
before
we
leave
this
city
lets
you
and
i
work
together
to
fix
it
and
then
we
can
finally
give
the
american
people
a
balanced
budget
members
of
congress
passage
of
grammrudmanhollings
gives
us
an
historic
opportunity
to
achieve
what
has
eluded
our
national
leadership
for
decades
forcing
the
federal
government
to
live
within
its
means
your
schedule
now
requires
that
the
budget
resolution
be
passed
by
april
th
the
very
day
americas
families
have
to
foot
the
bill
for
the
budgets
that
you
produce
how
often
we
read
of
a
husband
and
wife
both
working
struggling
from
paycheck
to
paycheck
to
raise
a
family
meet
a
mortgage
pay
their
taxes
and
bills
and
yet
some
in
congress
say
taxes
must
be
raised
well
im
sorry
theyre
asking
the
wrong
people
to
tighten
their
belts
its
time
we
reduce
the
federal
budget
and
left
the
family
budget
alone
we
do
not
face
large
deficits
because
american
families
are
undertaxed
we
face
those
deficits
because
the
federal
government
overspends
the
detailed
budget
that
we
will
submit
will
meet
the
grammrudmanhollings
target
for
deficit
reductions
meet
our
commitment
to
ensure
a
strong
national
defense
meet
our
commitment
to
protect
social
security
and
the
truly
less
fortunate
and
yes
meet
our
commitment
to
not
raise
taxes
how
should
we
accomplish
this
well
not
by
taking
from
those
in
need
as
families
take
care
of
their
own
government
must
provide
shelter
and
nourishment
for
those
who
cannot
provide
for
themselves
but
we
must
revise
or
replace
programs
enacted
in
the
name
of
compassion
that
degrade
the
moral
worth
of
work
encourage
family
breakups
and
drive
entire
communities
into
a
bleak
and
heartless
dependency
grammrudmanhollings
can
mark
a
dramatic
improvement
but
experience
shows
that
simply
setting
deficit
targets
does
not
assure
theyll
be
met
we
must
proceed
with
grace
commission
reforms
against
waste
and
tonight
i
ask
you
to
give
me
what
governors
have
give
me
a
lineitem
veto
this
year
give
me
the
authority
to
veto
waste
and
ill
take
the
responsibility
ill
make
the
cuts
ill
take
the
heat
this
authority
would
not
give
me
any
monopoly
power
but
simply
prevent
spending
measures
from
sneaking
through
that
could
not
pass
on
their
own
merit
and
you
can
sustain
or
override
my
veto
thats
the
way
the
system
should
work
once
weve
made
the
hard
choices
we
should
lock
in
our
gains
with
a
balanced
budget
amendment
to
the
constitution
i
mentioned
that
we
will
meet
our
commitment
to
national
defense
we
must
meet
it
defense
is
not
just
another
budget
expense
keeping
america
strong
free
and
at
peace
is
solely
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
it
is
governments
prime
responsibility
we
have
devoted
years
trying
to
narrow
a
dangerous
gap
born
of
illusion
and
neglect
and
weve
made
important
gains
yet
the
threat
from
soviet
forces
conventional
and
strategic
from
the
soviet
drive
for
domination
from
the
increase
in
espionage
and
state
terror
remains
great
this
is
reality
closing
our
eyes
will
not
make
reality
disappear
we
pledged
together
to
hold
real
growth
in
defense
spending
to
the
bare
minimum
my
budget
honors
that
pledge
and
im
now
asking
you
the
congress
to
keep
its
end
of
the
bargain
the
soviets
must
know
that
if
america
reduces
her
defenses
it
will
be
because
of
a
reduced
threat
not
a
reduced
resolve
keeping
america
strong
is
as
vital
to
the
national
security
as
controlling
federal
spending
is
to
our
economic
security
but
as
i
have
said
before
the
most
powerful
force
we
can
enlist
against
the
federal
deficit
is
an
everexpanding
american
economy
unfettered
and
free
the
magic
of
opportunityunreserved
unfailing
unrestrainedisnt
this
the
calling
that
unites
us
i
believe
our
tax
rate
cuts
for
the
people
have
done
more
to
spur
a
spirit
of
risktaking
and
help
americas
economy
break
free
than
any
program
since
john
kennedys
tax
cut
almost
a
quarter
century
ago
now
history
calls
us
to
press
on
to
complete
efforts
for
an
historic
tax
reform
providing
new
opportunity
for
all
and
ensuring
that
all
pay
their
fair
share
but
no
more
weve
come
this
far
will
you
join
me
now
and
well
walk
this
last
mile
together
you
know
my
views
on
this
we
cannot
and
we
will
not
accept
tax
reform
that
is
a
tax
increase
in
disguise
true
reform
must
be
an
engine
of
productivity
and
growth
and
that
means
a
top
personal
rate
no
higher
than
percent
true
reform
must
be
truly
fair
and
that
means
raising
personal
exemptions
to
true
reform
means
a
tax
system
that
at
long
last
is
profamily
projobs
profuture
and
proamerica
as
we
knock
down
the
barriers
to
growth
we
must
redouble
our
efforts
for
freer
and
fairer
trade
we
have
already
taken
actions
to
counter
unfair
trading
practices
and
to
pry
open
closed
foreign
markets
we
will
continue
to
do
so
we
will
also
oppose
legislation
touted
as
providing
protection
that
in
reality
pits
one
american
worker
against
another
one
industry
against
another
one
community
against
another
and
that
raises
prices
for
us
all
if
the
united
states
can
trade
with
other
nations
on
a
level
playing
field
we
can
outproduce
outcompete
and
outsell
anybody
anywhere
in
the
world
the
constant
expansion
of
our
economy
and
exports
requires
a
sound
and
stable
dollar
at
home
and
reliable
exchange
rates
around
the
world
we
must
never
again
permit
wild
currency
swings
to
cripple
our
farmers
and
other
exporters
farmers
in
particular
have
suffered
from
past
unwise
government
policies
they
must
not
be
abandoned
with
problems
they
did
not
create
and
cannot
control
weve
begun
coordinating
economic
and
monetary
policy
among
our
major
trading
partners
but
theres
more
to
do
and
tonight
i
am
directing
treasury
secretary
jim
baker
to
determine
if
the
nations
of
the
world
should
convene
to
discuss
the
role
and
relationship
of
our
currencies
confident
in
our
future
and
secure
in
our
values
americans
are
striving
forward
to
embrace
the
future
we
see
it
not
only
in
our
recovery
but
in
straight
years
of
falling
crime
rates
as
families
and
communities
band
together
to
fight
pornograp
hy
drugs
and
lawlessness
and
to
give
back
to
their
children
the
safe
and
yes
innocent
childhood
they
deserve
we
see
it
in
the
renaissance
in
education
the
rising
sat
scores
for
yearslast
years
increase
the
greatest
since
it
wasnt
government
and
washington
lobbies
that
turned
education
around
it
was
the
american
people
who
in
reaching
for
excellence
knew
to
reach
back
to
basics
we
must
continue
the
advance
by
supporting
discipline
in
our
schools
vouchers
that
give
parents
freedom
of
choice
and
we
must
give
back
to
our
children
their
lost
right
to
acknowledge
god
in
their
classrooms
we
are
a
nation
of
idealists
yet
today
there
is
a
wound
in
our
national
conscience
america
will
never
be
whole
as
long
as
the
right
to
life
granted
by
our
creator
is
denied
to
the
unborn
for
the
rest
of
my
time
i
shall
do
what
i
can
to
see
that
this
wound
is
one
day
healed
as
we
work
to
make
the
american
dream
real
for
all
we
must
also
look
to
the
condition
of
americas
families
struggling
parents
today
worry
how
they
will
provide
their
children
the
advantages
that
their
parents
gave
them
in
the
welfare
culture
the
breakdown
of
the
family
the
most
basic
support
system
has
reached
crisis
proportionsin
female
and
child
poverty
child
abandonment
horrible
crimes
and
deteriorating
schools
after
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
poverty
programs
the
plight
of
the
poor
grows
more
painful
but
the
waste
in
dollars
and
cents
pales
before
the
most
tragic
loss
the
sinful
waste
of
human
spirit
and
potential
we
can
ignore
this
terrible
truth
no
longer
as
franklin
roosevelt
warned
years
ago
standing
before
this
chamber
he
said
welfare
is
a
narcotic
a
subtle
destroyer
of
the
human
spirit
and
we
must
now
escape
the
spiders
web
of
dependency
tonight
i
am
charging
the
white
house
domestic
council
to
present
me
by
december
an
evaluation
of
programs
and
a
strategy
for
immediate
action
to
meet
the
financial
educational
social
and
safety
concerns
of
poor
families
im
talking
about
real
and
lasting
emancipation
because
the
success
of
welfare
should
be
judged
by
how
many
of
its
recipients
become
independent
of
welfare
further
after
seeing
how
devastating
illness
can
destroy
the
financial
security
of
the
family
i
am
directing
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
dr
otis
bowen
to
report
to
me
by
year
end
with
recommendations
on
how
the
private
sector
and
government
can
work
together
to
address
the
problems
of
affordable
insurance
for
those
whose
life
savings
would
otherwise
be
threatened
when
catastrophic
illness
strikes
and
tonight
i
want
to
speak
directly
to
americas
younger
generation
because
you
hold
the
destiny
of
our
nation
in
your
hands
with
all
the
temptations
young
people
face
it
sometimes
seems
the
allure
of
the
permissive
society
requires
superhuman
feats
of
selfcontrol
but
the
call
of
the
future
is
too
strong
the
challenge
too
great
to
get
lost
in
the
blind
alleyways
of
dissolution
drugs
and
despair
never
has
there
been
a
more
exciting
time
to
be
alive
a
time
of
rousing
wonder
and
heroic
achievement
as
they
said
in
the
film
back
to
the
future
where
were
going
we
dont
need
roads
well
today
physicists
peering
into
the
infinitely
small
realms
of
subatomic
particles
find
reaffirmations
of
religious
faith
astronomers
build
a
space
telescope
that
can
see
to
the
edge
of
the
universe
and
possibly
back
to
the
moment
of
creation
so
yes
this
nation
remains
fully
committed
to
americas
space
program
were
going
forward
with
our
shuttle
flights
were
going
forward
to
build
our
space
station
and
we
are
going
forward
with
research
on
a
new
orient
express
that
could
by
the
end
of
the
next
decade
take
off
from
dulles
airport
accelerate
up
to
times
the
speed
of
sound
attaining
low
earth
orbit
or
flying
to
tokyo
within
hours
and
the
same
technology
transforming
our
lives
can
solve
the
greatest
problem
of
the
th
century
a
security
shield
can
one
day
render
nuclear
weapons
obsolete
and
free
mankind
from
the
prison
of
nuclear
terror
america
met
one
historic
challenge
and
went
to
the
moon
now
america
must
meet
another
to
make
our
strategic
defense
real
for
all
the
citizens
of
planet
earth
let
us
speak
of
our
deepest
longing
for
the
future
to
leave
our
children
a
land
that
is
free
and
just
and
a
world
at
peace
it
is
my
hope
that
our
fireside
summit
in
geneva
and
mr
gorbachevs
upcoming
visit
to
america
can
lead
to
a
more
stable
relationship
surely
no
people
on
earth
hate
war
or
love
peace
more
than
we
americans
but
we
cannot
stroll
into
the
future
with
childlike
faith
our
differences
with
a
system
that
openly
proclaims
and
practices
an
alleged
right
to
command
peoples
lives
and
to
export
its
ideology
by
force
are
deep
and
abiding
logic
and
history
compel
us
to
accept
that
our
relationship
be
guided
by
realismrockhard
cleareyed
steady
and
sure
our
negotiators
in
geneva
have
proposed
a
radical
cut
in
offensive
forces
by
each
side
with
no
cheating
they
have
made
clear
that
soviet
compliance
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
agreements
is
essential
if
the
soviet
government
wants
an
agreement
that
truly
reduces
nuclear
arms
there
will
be
such
an
agreement
but
arms
control
is
no
substitute
for
peace
we
know
that
peace
follows
in
freedoms
path
and
conflicts
erupt
when
the
will
of
the
people
is
denied
so
we
must
prepare
for
peace
not
only
by
reducing
weapons
but
by
bolstering
prosperity
liberty
and
democracy
however
and
wherever
we
can
we
advance
the
promise
of
opportunity
every
time
we
speak
out
on
behalf
of
lower
tax
rates
freer
markets
sound
currencies
around
the
world
we
strengthen
the
family
of
freedom
every
time
we
work
with
allies
and
come
to
the
aid
of
friends
under
siege
and
we
can
enlarge
the
family
of
free
nations
if
we
will
defend
the
unalienable
rights
of
all
gods
children
to
follow
their
dreams
to
those
imprisoned
in
regimes
held
captive
to
those
beaten
for
daring
to
fight
for
freedom
and
democracyfor
their
right
to
worship
to
speak
to
live
and
to
prosper
in
the
family
of
free
nationswe
say
to
you
tonight
you
are
not
alone
freedom
fighters
america
will
support
with
moral
and
material
assistance
your
right
not
just
to
fight
and
die
for
freedom
but
to
fight
and
win
freedomto
win
freedom
in
afghanistan
in
angola
in
cambodia
and
in
nicaragua
this
is
a
great
moral
challenge
for
the
entire
free
world
surely
no
issue
is
more
important
for
peace
in
our
own
hemisphere
for
the
security
of
our
frontiers
for
the
protection
of
our
vital
interests
than
to
achieve
democracy
in
nicaragua
and
to
protect
nicaraguas
democratic
neighbors
this
year
i
will
be
asking
congress
for
the
means
to
do
what
must
be
done
for
that
great
and
good
cause
as
former
senator
henry
mscoop
jackson
the
inspiration
for
our
bipartisan
commission
on
central
america
once
said
in
matters
of
national
security
the
best
politics
is
no
politics
what
we
accomplish
this
year
in
each
challenge
we
face
will
set
our
course
for
the
balance
of
the
decade
indeed
for
the
remainder
of
the
century
after
all
weve
done
so
far
let
no
one
say
that
this
nation
cannot
reach
the
destiny
of
our
dreams
america
believes
america
is
ready
america
can
win
the
race
to
the
futureand
we
shall
the
american
dream
is
a
song
of
hope
that
rings
through
night
winter
air
vivid
tender
music
that
warms
our
hearts
when
the
least
among
us
aspire
to
the
greatest
things
to
venture
a
daring
enterprise
to
unearth
new
beauty
in
music
literature
and
art
to
discover
a
new
universe
inside
a
tiny
silicon
chip
or
a
single
human
cell
we
see
the
dream
coming
true
in
the
spirit
of
discovery
of
richard
cavoli
all
his
life
hes
been
enthralled
by
the
mysteries
of
medicine
and
richard
we
know
that
the
experiment
that
you
began
in
high
school
was
launched
and
lost
last
week
yet
your
dream
lives
and
as
long
as
its
real
work
of
noble
note
will
yet
be
done
work
that
could
reduce
the
harmful
effects
of
x
rays
on
patients
and
enable
astronomers
to
view
the
golden
gateways
of
the
farthest
stars
we
see
the
dream
glow
in
the
towering
talent
of
a
yearold
tyrone
ford
a
child
prodigy
of
gospel
music
he
has
surmounted
personal
adversity
to
become
an
accomplished
pianist
and
singer
he
also
directs
the
choirs
of
three
churches
and
has
performed
at
the
kennedy
center
with
god
as
your
composer
tyrone
your
music
will
be
the
music
of
angels
we
see
the
dream
being
saved
by
the
courage
of
the
yearold

with
bravery
like
yours
shelby
america
need
never

for
our

and
we
see
the

report
that
after
years

the
american
people
have
brought
forth
a
nation
renewed
stronger
freer
and
more
secure
than
before
four
years

we
began
to
change
forever
i
hope
our

its

in

out
of
that
change
has
come
great
and
robust
growthin
our

us
hope
and
leave
us
wiser
than

in
the
hearts
of
our
families
communities
workplaces
and
voluntary
groups
which
together
are
unleashing
the
invincible
spirit
of
one
great
nation
under
god
four
years
ago
we
said
we
would
invigorate
our
economy
by
giving
people
greater
freedom
and
incentives
to
take
risks
and
letting
them
keep
more
of
what
they
earned
we
did
what
we
promised
and
a
great
industrial
giant
is
reborn
tonight
we
can
take
pride
in
straight
months
of
economic
growth
the
strongest
in
years
a
year
inflation
average
of
percent
the
lowest
in
years
and
million
new
jobs
in
years
with
more
of
our
citizens
working
than
ever
before
new
freedom
in
our
lives
has
planted
the
rich
seeds
for
future
success
for
an
america
of
wisdom
that
honors
the
family
knowing
that
if
as
the
family
goes
so
goes
our
civilization
for
an
america
of
vision
that
sees
tomorrows
dreams
in
the
learning
and
hard
work
we
do
today
for
an
america
of
courage
whose
service
men
and
women
even
as
we
meet
proudly
stand
watch
on
the
frontiers
of
freedom
for
an
america
of
compassion
that
opens
its
heart
to
those
who
cry
out
for
help
we
have
begun
well
but
its
only
a
beginning
were
not
here
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
what
we
have
done
but
to
challenge
ourselves
to
finish
what
has
not
yet
been
done
were
here
to
speak
for
millions
in
our
inner
cities
who
long
for
real
jobs
safe
neighborhoods
and
schools
that
truly
teach
were
here
to
speak
for
the
american
farmer
the
entrepreneur
and
every
worker
in
industries
fighting
to
modernize
and
compete
and
yes
were
here
to
stand
and
proudly
so
for
all
who
struggle

asked
what
great
principle
holds
our

together
abraham

said
something
in
the
declaration
giving
liberty
not
alone
to
the
people
of
this
country
but
hope
to
the
world
for
all
future
time
we
honor
the
giants
of
our
history
not
by
going
back
but
forward
to
the
dreams
their
vision
foresaw
my
fellow
citizens
this
nation
is
poised
for
greatness
the
time
has
come
to
proceed
toward
a
great
new
challengea
second
american
revolution
of
hope
and
opportunity
a
revolution
carrying
us
to
new
heights
of
progress
by
pushing
back
frontiers
of
knowledge
and
space
a
revolution
of
spirit
that
taps
the
soul
of
america
enabling
us
to
summon
greater
strength
than
weve
ever
known
and
a
revolution
that
carries
beyond
our
shores
the
golden
promise
of
human
freedom
in
a
world
of
peace
let
us
begin
by
challenging
our
conventional
wisdom
there
are
no
constraints
on
the
human
mind
no
walls
around
the
human
spirit
no
barriers
to
our
progress
except
those
we
ourselves
erect
already
pushing
down
tax
rates
has
freed
our
economy
to
vault
forward
to
record
growth
in
europe
theyre
calling
it
the
american
miracle
day
by
day
were
shattering
accepted
notions
of
what
is
possible
when
i
was
growing
up
we
failed
to
see
how
a
new
thing
called
radio
would
transform
our
marketplace
well
today
many
have
not
yet
seen
how
advances
in
technology
are
transforming
our
lives
in
the
late
s
workers
at
the
att
semiconductor
plant
in
pennsylvania
produced
five
transistors
a
day
for
apiece
they
now
produce
over
a
million
for
less
than
a
penny
apiece
new
laser
techniques
could
revolutionize
heart
bypass
surgery
cut
diagnosis
time
for
viruses
linked
to
cancer
from
weeks
to
minutes
reduce
hospital
costs
dramatically
and
hold
out
new
promise
for
saving
human
lives
our
automobile
industry
has
overhauled
assembly
lines
increased
worker
productivity
and
is
competitive
once
again
we
stand
on
the
threshold
of
a
great
ability
to
produce
more
do
more
be
more
our
economy
is
not
getting
older
and
weaker
its
getting
younger
and
stronger
it
doesnt
need
rest
and
supervision
it
needs
new
challenge
greater
freedom
and
that
word
freedom
is
the
key
to
the
second
american
revolution
that
we
need
to
bring
about
let
us
move
together
with
an
historic
reform
of
tax
simplification
for
fairness
and
growth
last
year
i
asked
treasury
secretarythenregan
to
develop
a
plan
to
simplify
the
tax
code
so
all
taxpayers
would
be
treated
more
fairly
and
personal
tax
rates
could
come
further
down
we
have
cut
tax
rates
by
almost
percent
yet
the
tax
system
remains
unfair
and
limits
our
potential
for
growth
exclusions
and
exemptions
cause
similar
incomes
to
be
taxed
at
different
levels
lowincome
families
face
steep
tax
barriers
that
make
hard
lives
even
harder
the
treasury
department
has
produced
an
excellent
reform
plan
whose
principles
will
guide
the
final
proposal
that
we
will
ask
you
to
enact
one
thing
that
tax
reform
will
not
be
is
a
tax
increase
in
disguise
we
will
not
jeopardize
the
mortgage
interest
deduction
that
families
need
we
will
reduce
personal
tax
rates
as
low
as
possible
by
removing
many
tax
preferences
we
will
propose
a
top
rate
of
no
more
than
percent
and
possibly
lower
and
we
will
propose
reducing
corporate
rates
while
maintaining
incentives
for
capital
formation
to
encourage
opportunity
and
jobs
rather
than
dependency
and
welfare
we
will
propose
that
individuals
living
at
or
near
the
poverty
line
be
totally
exempt
from
federal
income
tax
to
restore
fairness
to
families
we
will
propose
increasing
significantly
the
personal
exemption
and
tonight
i
am
instructing
treasury
secretary
james
bakeri
have
to
get
used
to
saying
thatto
begin
working
with
congressional
authors
and
committees
for
bipartisan
legislation
conforming
to
these
principles
we
will
call
upon
the
american
people
for
support
and
upon
every
man
and
woman
in
this
chamber
together
we
can
pass
this
year
a
tax
bill
for
fairness
simplicity
and
growth
making
this
economy
the
engine
of
our
dreams
and
america
the
investment
capital
of
the
world
so
let
us
begin
tax
simplification
will
be
a
giant
step
toward
unleashing
the
tremendous
pentup
power
of
our
economy
but
a
second
american
revolution
must
carry
the
promise
of
opportunity
for
all
it
is
time
to
liberate
the
spirit
of
enterprise
in
the
most
distressed
areas
of
our
country
this
government
will
meet
its
responsibility
to
help
those
in
need
but
policies
that
increase
dependency
break
up
families
and
destroy
selfrespect
are
not
progressive
theyre
reactionary
despite
our
strides
in
civil
rights
blacks
hispanics
and
all
minorities
will
not
have
full
and
equal
power
until
they
have
full
economic
power
we
have
repeatedly
sought
passage
of
enterprise
zones
to
help
those
in
the
abandoned
corners
of
our
land
find
jobs
learn
skills
and
build
better
lives
this
legislation
is
supported
by
a
majority
of
you
mr
speaker
i
know
we
agree
that
there
must
be
no
forgotten
americans
let
us
place
new
dreams
in
a
million
hearts
and
create
a
new
generation
of
entrepreneurs
by
passing
enterprise
zones
this
year
and
tip
you
could
make
that
a
birthday
present
nor
must
we
lose
the
chance
to
pass
our
youth
employment
opportunity
wage
proposal
we
can
help
teenagers
who
have
the
highest
unemployment
rate
find
summer
jobs
so
they
can
know
the
pride
of
work
and
have
confidence
in
their
futures
well
continue
to
support
the
job
training
partnership
act
which
has
a
nearly
twothirds
job
placement
rate
credits
in
education
and
health
care
vouchers
will
help
working
families
shop
for
services
that
they
need
our
administration
is
already
encouraging
certain
lowincome
public
housing
residents
to
own
and
manage
their
own
dwellings
its
time
that
all
public
housing
residents
have
that
opportunity
of
ownership
the
federal
government
can
help
create
a
new
atmosphere
of
freedom
but
states
and
localities
many
of
which
enjoy
surpluses
from
the
recovery
must
not
permit
their
tax
and
regulatory
policies
to
stand
as
barriers
to
growth
let
us
resolve
that
we
will
stop
spreading
dependency
and
start
spreading
opportunity
that
we
will
stop
spreading
bondage
and
start
spreading
freedom
there
are
some
who
say
that
growth
initiatives
must
await
final
action
on
deficit
reductions
well
the
best
way
to
reduce
deficits
is
through
economic
growth
more
businesses
will
be
started
more
investments
made
more
jobs
created
and
more
people
will
be
on
payrolls
paying
taxes
the
best
way
to
reduce
government
spending
is
to
reduce
the
need
for
spending
by
increasing
prosperity
each
added
percentage
point
per
year
of
real
gnp
growth
will
lead
to
cumulative
reduction
in
deficits
of
nearly
billion
over
years
to
move
steadily
toward
a
balanced
budget
we
must
also
lighten
governments
claim
on
our
total
economy
we
will
not
do
this
by
raising
taxes
we
must
make
sure
that
our
economy
grows
faster
than
the
growth
in
spending
by
the
federal
government
in
our
fiscal
year
budget
overall
government
program
spending
will
be
frozen
at
the
current
level
it
must
not
be
one
dime
higher
than
fiscal
year
and
three
points
are
key
first
the
social
safety
net
for
the
elderly
the
needy
the
disabled
and
unemployed
will
be
left
intact
growth
of
our
major
health
care
programs
medicare
and
medicaid
will
be
slowed
but
protections
for
the
elderly
and
needy
will
be
preserved
second
we
must
not
relax
our
efforts
to
restore
military
strength
just
as
we
near
our
goal
of
a
fully
equipped
trained
and
ready
professional
corps
national
security
is
governments
first
responsibility
so
in
past
years
defens
e
spending
took
about
half
the
federal
budget
today
it
takes
less
than
a
third
weve
already
reduced
our
planned
defense
expenditures
by
nearly
a
hundred
billion
dollars
over
the
past
years
and
reduced
projected
spending
again
this
year
you
know
we
only
have
a
militaryindustrial
complex
until
a
time
of
danger
and
then
it
becomes
the
arsenal
of
democracy
spending
for
defense
is
investing
in
things
that
are
pricelesspeace
and
freedom
third
we
must
reduce
or
eliminate
costly
government
subsidies
for
example
deregulation
of
the
airline
industry
has
led
to
cheaper
airfares
but
on
amtrak
taxpayers
pay
about
per
passenger
every
time
an
amtrak
train
leaves
the
station
its
time
we
ended
this
huge
federal
subsidy
our
farm
program
costs
have
quadrupled
in
recent
years
yet
i
know
from
visiting
farmers
many
in
great
financial
distress
that
we
need
an
orderly
transition
to
a
marketoriented
farm
economy
we
can
help
farmers
best
not
by
expanding
federal
payments
but
by
making
fundamental
reforms
keeping
interest
rates
heading
down
and
knocking
down
foreign
trade
barriers
to
american
farm
exports
were
moving
ahead
with
grace
commission
reforms
to
eliminate
waste
and
improve
governments
management
practices
in
the
long
run
we
must
protect
the
taxpayers
from
government
and
i
ask
again
that
you
pass
as
states
have
now
called
for
an
amendment
mandating
the
federal
government
spend
no
more
than
it
takes
in
and
i
ask
for
the
authority
used
responsibly
by
governors
to
veto
individual
items
in
appropriation
bills
senator
mattingly
has
introduced
a
bill
permitting
a
year
trial
run
of
the
lineitem
veto
i
hope
youll
pass
and
send
that
legislation
to
my
desk
nearly
years
of
government
living
beyond
its
means
has
brought
us
to
a
time
of
reckoning
ours
is
but
a
moment
in
history
but
one
moment
of
courage
idealism
and
bipartisan
unity
can
change
american
history
forever
sound
monetary
policy
is
key
to
longrunning
economic
strength
and
stability
we
will
continue
to
cooperate
with
the
federal
reserve
board
seeking
a
steady
policy
that
ensures
price
stability
without
keeping
interest
rates
artificially
high
or
needlessly
holding
down
growth
reducing
unneeded
red
tape
and
regulations
and
deregulating
the
energy
transportation
and
financial
industries
have
unleashed
new
competition
giving
consumers
more
choices
better
services
and
lower
prices
in
just
one
set
of
grant
programs
we
have
reduced
pages
of
regulations
to
we
seek
to
fully
deregulate
natural
gas
to
bring
on
new
supplies
and
bring
us
closer
to
energy
independence
consistent
with
safety
standards
we
will
continue
removing
restraints
on
the
bus
and
railroad
industries
we
will
soon
end
up
legislationor
send
up
legislation
i
should
sayto
return
conrail
to
the
private
sector
where
it
belongs
and
we
will
support
further
deregulation
of
the
trucking
industry
every
dollar
the
federal
government
does
not
take
from
us
every
decision
it
does
not
make
for
us
will
make
our
economy
stronger
our
lives
more
abundant
our
future
more
free
our
second
american
revolution
will
push
on
to
new
possibilities
not
only
on
earth
but
in
the
next
frontier
of
space
despite
budget
restraints
we
will
seek
record
funding
for
research
and
development
weve
seen
the
success
of
the
space
shuttle
now
were
going
to
develop
a
permanently
manned
space
station
and
new
opportunities
for
free
enterprise
because
in
the
next
decade
americans
and
our
friends
around
the
world
will
be
living
and
working
together
in
space
in
the
zero
gravity
of
space
we
could
manufacture
in
days
lifesaving
medicines
it
would
take
years
to
make
on
earth
we
can
make
crystals
of
exceptional
purity
to
produce
super
computers
creating
jobs
technologies
and
medical
breakthroughs
beyond
anything
we
ever
dreamed
possible
as
we
do
all
this
well
continue
to
protect
our
natural
resources
we
will
seek
reauthorization
and
expanded
funding
for
the
superfund
program
to
continue
cleaning
up
hazardous
waste
sites
which
threaten
human
health
and
the
environment
now
theres
another
great
heritage
to
speak
of
this
evening
of
all
the
changes
that
have
swept
america
the
past
years
none
brings
greater
promise
than
our
rediscovery
of
the
values
of
faith
freedom
family
work
and
neighborhood
we
see
signs
of
renewal
in
increased
attendance
in
places
of
worship
renewed
optimism
and
faith
in
our
future
love
of
country
rediscovered
by
our
young
who
are
leading
the
way
weve
rediscovered
that
work
is
good
in
and
of
itself
that
it
ennobles
us
to
create
and
contribute
no
matter
how
seemingly
humble
our
jobs
weve
seen
a
powerful
new
current
from
an
old
and
honorable
traditionamerican
generosity
from
thousands
answering
peace
corps
appeals
to
help
boost
food
production
in
africa
to
millions
volunteering
time
corporations
adopting
schools
and
communities
pulling
together
to
help
the
neediest
among
us
at
home
we
have
refound
our
values
private
sector
initiatives
are
crucial
to
our
future
i
thank
the
congress
for
passing
equal
access
legislation
giving
religious
groups
the
same
right
to
use
classrooms
after
school
that
other
groups
enjoy
but
no
citizen
need
tremble
nor
the
world
shudder
if
a
child
stands
in
a
classroom
and
breathes
a
prayer
we
ask
you
again
give
children
back
a
right
they
had
for
a
century
and
a
half
or
more
in
this
country
the
question
of
abortion
grips
our
nation
abortion
is
either
the
taking
of
a
human
life
or
it
isnt
and
if
it
isand
medical
technology
is
increasingly
showing
it
isit
must
be
stopped
it
is
a
terrible
irony
that
while
some
turn
to
abortion
so
many
others
who
cannot
become
parents
cry
out
for
children
to
adopt
we
have
room
for
these
children
we
can
fill
the
cradles
of
those
who
want
a
child
to
love
and
tonight
i
ask
you
in
the
congress
to
move
this
year
on
legislation
to
protect
the
unborn
in
the
area
of
education
were
returning
to
excellence
and
again
the
heroes
are
our
people
not
government
were
stressing
basics
of
discipline
rigorous
testing
and
homework
while
helping
children
become
computersmart
as
well
for
years
scholastic
aptitude
test
scores
of
our
high
school
students
went
down
but
now
they
have
gone
up
of
the
last
years
we
must
go
forward
in
our
commitment
to
the
new
basics
giving
parents
greater
authority
and
making
sure
good
teachers
are
rewarded
for
hard
work
and
achievement
through
merit
pay
of
all
the
changes
in
the
past
years
none
has
more
threatened
our
sense
of
national
wellbeing
than
the
explosion
of
violent
crime
one
does
not
have
to
be
attacked
to
be
a
victim
the
woman
who
must
run
to
her
car
after
shopping
at
night
is
a
victim
the
couple
draping
their
door
with
locks
and
chains
are
victims
as
is
the
tired
decent
cleaning
woman
who
cant
ride
a
subway
home
without
being
afraid
we
do
not
seek
to
violate
the
rights
of
defendants
but
shouldnt
we
feel
more
compassion
for
the
victims
of
crime
than
for
those
who
commit
crime
for
the
first
time
in
years
the
crime
index
has
fallen
years
in
a
row
weve
convicted
over
drug
offenders
and
put
them
as
well
as
leaders
of
organized
crime
behind
bars
in
record
numbers
but
we
must
do
more
i
urge
the
house
to
follow
the
senate
and
enact
proposals
permitting
use
of
all
reliable
evidence
that
police
officers
acquire
in
good
faith
these
proposals
would
also
reform
the
habeas
corpus
laws
and
allow
in
keeping
with
the
will
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
where
necessary
there
can
be
no
economic
revival
in
ghettos
when
the
most
violent
among
us
are
allowed
to
roam
free
its
time
we
restored
domestic
tranquility
and
we
mean
to
do
just
that
just
as
were
positioned
as
never
before
to
secure
justice
in
our
economy
were
poised
as
never
before
to
create
a
safer
freer
more
peaceful
world
our
alliances
are
stronger
than
ever
our
economy
is
stronger
than
ever
we
have
resumed
our
historic
role
as
a
leader
of
the
free
world
and
all
of
these
together
are
a
great
force
for
peace
since
weve
been
committed
to
seeking
fair
and
verifiable
arms
agreements
that
would
lower
the
risk
of
war
and
reduce
the
size
of
nuclear
arsenals
now
our
determination
to
maintain
a
strong
defense
has
influenced
the
soviet
union
to
return
to
the
bargaining
table
our
negotiators
must
be
able
to
go
to
that
table
with
the
united
support
of
the
american
people
all
of
us
have
no
greater
dream
than
to
see
the
day
when
nuclear
weapons
are
banned
from
this
earth
forever
each
member
of
the
congress
has
a
role
to
play
in
modernizing
our
defenses
thus
supporting
our
chances
for
a
meaningful
arms
agreement
your
vote
this
spring
on
the
peacekeeper
missile
will
be
a
critical
test
of
our
resolve
to
maintain
the
strength
we
need
and
move
toward
mutual
and
verifiable
arms
reductions
for
the
past
years
weve
believed
that
no
war
will
be
launched
as
long
as
each
side
knows
it
can
retaliate
with
a
deadly
counterstrike
well
i
believe
theres
a
better
way
of
eliminating
the
threat
of
nuclear
war
it
is
a
strategic
defense
initiative
aimed
ultimately
at
finding
a
nonnuclear
defense
against
ballistic
missiles
its
the
most
hopeful
possibility
of
the
nuclear
age
but
its
not
very
well
understood
some
say
it
will
bring
war
to
the
heavens
but
its
purpose
is
to
deter
war
in
the
heavens
and
on
earth
now
some
say
the
research
would
be
expensive
perhaps
but
it
could
save
millions
of
lives
indeed
humanity
itself
and
some
say
if
we
build
such
a
system
the
soviets
will
build
a
defense
system
of
their
own
well
they
already
have
strategic
defenses
that
surpass
ours
a
civil
defense
system
where
we
have
almost
none
and
a
research
program
covering
roughly
the
same
areas
of
technology
that
were
now
exploring
and
finally
some
say
the
research
will
take
a
long
time
well
the
answer
to
that
is
lets
get
started
harry
truman
once
said
that
ultimately
our
security
and
the
worlds
hopes
for
peace
and
human
progress
lie
not
in
measures
of
defense
or
in
the
control
of
weapons
but
in
the
growth
and
expansion
of
freedom
and
selfgovernment
and
tonight
we
declare
anew
to
our
fellow
citizens
of
the
world
freedom
is
not
the
sole
prerogative
of
a
chosen
few
it
is
the
universa
l
right
of
all
gods
children
look
to
where
peace
and
prosperity
flourish
today
it
is
in
homes
that
freedom
built
victories
against
poverty
are
greatest
and
peace
most
secure
where
people
live
by
laws
that
ensure
free
press
free
speech
and
freedom
to
worship
vote
and
create
wealth
our
mission
is
to
nourish
and
defend
freedom
and
democracy
and
to
communicate
these
ideals
everywhere
we
can
americas
economic
success
is
freedoms
success
it
can
be
repeated
a
hundred
times
in
a
hundred
different
nations
many
countries
in
east
asia
and
the
pacific
have
few
resources
other
than
the
enterprise
of
their
own
people
but
through
low
tax
rates
and
free
markets
theyve
soared
ahead
of
centralized
economies
and
now
china
is
opening
up
its
economy
to
meet
its
needs
we
need
a
stronger
and
simpler
approach
to
the
process
of
making
and
implementing
trade
policy
and
well
be
studying
potential
changes
in
that
process
in
the
next
few
weeks
weve
seen
the
benefits
of
free
trade
and
lived
through
the
disasters
of
protectionism
tonight
i
ask
all
our
trading
partners
developed
and
developing
alike
to
join
us
in
a
new
round
of
trade
negotiations
to
expand
trade
and
competition
and
strengthen
the
global
economyand
to
begin
it
in
this
next
year
there
are
more
than
billion
human
beings
living
in
third
world
countries
with
an
average
per
capita
income
of
a
year
many
are
victims
of
dictatorships
that
impoverished
them
with
taxation
and
corruption
let
us
ask
our
allies
to
join
us
in
a
practical
program
of
trade
and
assistance
that
fosters
economic
development
through
personal
incentives
to
help
these
people
climb
from
poverty
on
their
own
we
cannot
play
innocents
abroad
in
a
world
thats
not
innocent
nor
can
we
be
passive
when
freedom
is
under
siege
without
resources
diplomacy
cannot
succeed
our
security
assistance
programs
help
friendly
governments
defend
themselves
and
give
them
confidence
to
work
for
peace
and
i
hope
that
you
in
the
congress
will
understand
that
dollar
for
dollar
security
assistance
contributes
as
much
to
global
security
as
our
own
defense
budget
we
must
stand
by
all
our
democratic
allies
and
we
must
not
break
faith
with
those
who
are
risking
their
liveson
every
continent
from
afghanistan
to
nicaraguato
defy
sovietsupported
aggression
and
secure
rights
which
have
been
ours
from
birth
the
sandinista
dictatorship
of
nicaragua
with
full
cubansoviet
bloc
support
not
only
persecutes
its
people
the
church
and
denies
a
free
press
but
arms
and
provides
bases
for
communist
terrorists
attacking
neighboring
states
support
for
freedom
fighters
is
selfdefense
and
totally
consistent
with
the
oas
and
un
charters
it
is
essential
that
the
congress
continue
all
facets
of
our
assistance
to
central
america
i
want
to
work
with
you
to
support
the
democratic
forces
whose
struggle
is
tied
to
our
own
security
and
tonight
ive
spoken
of
great
plans
and
great
dreams
theyre
dreams
we
can
make
come
true
two
hundred
years
of
american
history
should
have
taught
us
that
nothing
is
impossible
ten
years
ago
a
young
girl
left
vietnam
with
her
family
part
of
the
exodus
that
followed
the
fall
of
saigon
they
came
to
the
united
states
with
no
possessions
and
not
knowing
a
word
of
english
ten
years
agothe
young
girl
studied
hard
learned
english
and
finished
high
school
in
the
top
of
her
class
and
this
may
may
d
to
be
exact
is
a
big
date
on
her
calendar
just
years
from
the
time
she
left
vietnam
she
will
graduate
from
the
united
states
military
academy
at
west
point
i
thought
you
might
like
to
meet
an
american
hero
named
jean
nguyen
now
theres
someone
else
here
tonight
born
years
ago
she
lives
in
the
inner
city
where
she
cares
for
infants
born
of
mothers
who
are
heroin
addicts
the
children
born
in
withdrawal
are
sometimes
even
dropped
on
her
doorstep
she
helps
them
with
love
go
to
her
house
some
night
and
maybe
youll
see
her
silhouette
against
the
window
as
she
walks
the
floor
talking
softly
soothing
a
child
in
her
armsmother
hale
of
harlem
and
she
too
is
an
american
hero
jean
mother
hale
your
lives
tell
us
that
the
oldest
american
saying
is
new
again
anything
is
possible
in
america
if
we
have
the
faith
the
will
and
the
heart
history
is
asking
us
once
again
to
be
a
force
for
good
in
the
world
let
us
begin
in
unity
with
justice
and
love
thank
you
and
god
bless
you
note
the
president
spoke
at
pm
in
the
house
chamber
of
the
capitol
he
was
introduced
by
thomas
p
oneill
jr
speaker
of
the
house

the
address
was
broadcast
live
on
nationwide
radio
and

mr
speaker
mr
president
distinguished
members
of
the
congress
honored
guests
and
fellow
citizens
once
again
in
keeping
with
timehonored
tradition
i
have
come
to
report
to
you
on
the
state
of
the
union
and
im
pleased
to
report
that
america
is
much
improved
and
theres
good
reason
to
believe
that
improvement
will
continue
through
the
days
to
come
you
and
i
have
had
some
honest
and
open
differences
in
the
year
past
but
they
didnt
keep
us
from
joining
hands
in
bipartisan
cooperation
to
stop
a
long
decline
that
had
drained
this
nations
spirit
and
eroded
its
health
there
is
renewed
energy
and
optimism
throughout
the
land
america
is
back
standing
tall
looking
to
the
eighties
with
courage
confidence
and
hope
the
problems
were
overcoming
are
not
the
heritage
of
one
person
party
or
even
one
generation
its
just
the
tendency
of
government
to
grow
for
practices
and
programs
to
become
the
nearest
thing
to
eternal
life
well
ever
see
on
this
earth
and
theres
always
that
wellintentioned
chorus
of
voices
saying
with
a
little
more
power
and
a
little
more
money
we
could
do
so
much
for
the
people
for
a
time
we
forgot
the
american
dream
isnt
one
of
making
government
bigger
its
keeping
faith
with
the
mighty
spirit
of
free
people
under
god
as
we
came
to
the
decade
of
the
eighties
we
faced
the
worst
crisis
in
our
postwar
history
in
the
seventies
were
years
of
rising
problems
and
falling
confidence
there
was
a
feeling
government
had
grown
beyond
the
consent
of
the
governed
families
felt
helpless
in
the
face
of
mounting
inflation
and
the
indignity
of
taxes
that
reduced
reward
for
hard
work
thrift
and
risktaking
all
this
was
overlaid
by
an
evergrowing
web
of
rules
and
regulations
on
the
international
scene
we
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
wed
lost
the
respect
of
friend
and
foe
some
questioned
whether
we
had
the
will
to
defend
peace
and
freedom
but
america
is
too
great
for
small
dreams
there
was
a
hunger
in
the
land
for
a
spiritual
revival
if
you
will
a
crusade
for
renewal
the
american
people
said
let
us
look
to
the
future
with
confidence
both
at
home
and
abroad
let
us
give
freedom
a
chance
americans
were
ready
to
make
a
new
beginning
and
together
we
have
done
it
were
confronting
our
problems
one
by
one
hope
is
alive
tonight
for
millions
of
young
families
and
senior
citizens
set
free
from
unfair
tax
increases
and
crushing
inflation
inflation
has
been
beaten
down
from
to
percent
and
thats
a
great
victory
for
all
the
people
the
prime
rate
has
been
cut
almost
in
half
and
we
must
work
together
to
bring
it
down
even
more
together
we
passed
the
first
acrosstheboard
tax
reduction
for
everyone
since
the
kennedy
tax
cuts
next
year
tax
rates
will
be
indexed
so
inflation
cant
push
people
into
higher
brackets
when
they
get
costofliving
pay
raises
government
must
never
again
use
inflation
to
profit
at
the
peoples
expense
today
a
working
family
earning
has
more
in
purchasing
power
than
if
tax
and
inflation
rates
were
still
at
the
levels
real
aftertax
income
increased
percent
last
year
and
economic
deregulation
of
key
industries
like
transportation
has
offered
more
chancesor
choices
i
should
say
to
consumers
and
new
changesor
chances
for
entrepreneurs
and
protecting
safety
tonight
we
can
report
and
be
proud
of
one
of
the
best
recoveries
in
decades
send
away
the
handwringers
and
the
doubting
thomases
hope
is
reborn
for
couples
dreaming
of
owning
homes
and
for
risktakers
with
vision
to
create
tomorrows
opportunities
the
spirit
of
enterprise
is
sparked
by
the
sunrise
industries
of
hightech
and
by
small
business
people
with
big
ideaspeople
like
barbara
proctor
who
rose
from
a
ghetto
to
build
a
multimilliondollar
advertising
agency
in
chicago
carlos
perez
a
cuban
refugee
who
turned
and
a
dream
into
a
successful
importing
business
in
coral
gables
florida
people
like
these
are
heroes
for
the
eighties
they
helped
million
americans
find
jobs
in
more
people
are
drawing
paychecks
tonight
than
ever
before
and
congress
helpsor
progress
helps
everyonewell
congress
does
tooeveryone
in
women
filled
percent
of
all
the
new
jobs
in
managerial
professional
and
technical
fields
but
we
know
that
many
of
our
fellow
countrymen
are
still
out
of
work
wondering
what
will
come
of
their
hopes
and
dreams
can
we
love
america
and
not
reach
out
to
tell
them
you
are
not
forgotten
we
will
not
rest
until
each
of
you
can
reach
as
high
as
your
godgiven
talents
will
take
you
the
heart
of
america
is
strong
its
good
and
true
the
cynics
were
wrong
america
never
was
a
sick
society
were
seeing
rededication
to
bedrock
values
of
faith
family
work
neighborhood
peace
and
freedomvalues
that
help
bring
us
together
as
one
people
from
the
youngest
child
to
the
most
senior
citizen
the
congress
deserves
americas
thanks
for
helping
us
restore
pride
and
credibility
to
our
military
and
i
hope
that
youre
as
proud
as
i
am
of
the
young
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
have
volunteered
to
man
the
ramparts
in
defense
of
freedom
and
whose
dedication
valor
and
skill
increases
so
much
our
chance
of
living
in
a
world
at
peace
people
everywhere
hunger
for
peace
and
a
better
life
the
tide
of
the
future
is
a
freedom
tide
and
our
struggle
for
democracy
cannot
and
will
not
be
denied
this
nation
champions
peace
that
enshrines
liberty
democratic
rights
and
dignity
for
every
individual
americas
new
strength
confidence
and
purpose
are
carrying
hope
and
opportunity
far
from
our
shores
a
world
economic
recovery
is
underway
it
began
here
weve
journeyed
far
but
we
have
much
farther
to
go
franklin
roosevelt
told
us
years
ago
this
month
civilization
can
not
go
back
civilization
must
not
stand
still
we
have
undertaken
new
methods
it
is
our
task
to
perfect
to
improve
to
alter
when
necessary
but
in
all
cases
to
go
forward
its
time
to
move
forward
again
time
for
america
to
take
freedoms
next
step
let
us
unite
tonight
behind
four
great
goals
to
keep
america
free
secure
and
at
peace
in
the
eighties
together
we
can
ensure
steady
economic
growth
we
can
develop
americas
next
frontier
we
can
strengthen
our
traditional
values
and
we
can
build
a
meaningful
peace
to
protect
our
loved
ones
and
this
shining
star
of
faith
that
has
guided
millions
from
tyranny
to
the
safe
harbor
of
freedom
progress
and
hope
doing
these
things
will
open
wider
the
gates
of
opportunity
provide
greater
security
for
all
with
no
barriers
of
bigotry
or
discrimination
the
key
to
a
dynamic
decade
is
vigorous
economic
growth
our
first
great
goal
we
might
well
begin
with
common
sense
in
federal
budgeting
government
spending
no
more
than
government
takes
in
we
must
bring
federal
deficits
down
but
how
we
do
that
makes
all
the
difference
we
can
begin
by
limiting
the
size
and
scope
of
government
under
the
leadership
of
vice
president
bush
we
have
reduced
the
growth
of
federal
regulations
by
more
than
percent
and
cut
well
over
million
hours
of
governmentrequired
paperwork
each
year
this
will
save
the
public
more
than
billion
over
the
next
years
the
grace
commission
has
given
us
some
recommendations
for
reducing
wasteful
spending
and
theyre
being
examined
throughout
the
administration
federal
spending
growth
has
been
cut
from
percent
in
to
less
than
half
of
that
today
and
we
have
already
achieved
over
billion
in
budget
savings
for
the
period
of
to
but
thats
only
a
little
more
than
half
of
what
we
sought
government
is
still
spending
too
large
a
percentage
of
the
total
economy
now
some
insist
that
any
further
budget
savings
must
be
obtained
by
reducing
the
portion
spent
on
defense
this
ignores
the
fact
that
national
defense
is
solely
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
indeed
it
is
its
prime
responsibility
and
yet
defense
spending
is
less
than
a
third
of
the
total
budget
during
the
years
of
president
kennedy
and
of
the
years
before
that
defense
was
almost
half
the
total
budget
and
then
came
several
years
in
which
our
military
capability
was
allowed
to
deteriorate
to
a
very
dangerous
degree
we
are
just
now
restoring
through
the
essential
modernization
of
our
conventional
and
strategic
forces
our
capability
to
meet
our
present
and
future
security
needs
we
dare
not
shirk
our
responsibility
to
keep
america
free
secure
and
at
peace
the
last
decade
saw
domestic
spending
surge
literally
out
of
control
but
the
basis
for
such
spending
had
been
laid
in
previous
years
a
pattern
of
overspending
has
been
in
place
for
half
a
century
as
the
national
debt
grew
we
were
told
not
to
worry
that
we
owed
it
to
ourselves
now
we
know
that
deficits
are
a
cause
for
worry
but
theres
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
taxes
should
be
increased
spending
cut
or
some
of
both
fear
is
expressed
that
government
borrowing
to
fund
the
deficit
could
inhibit
the
economic
recovery
by
taking
capital
needed
for
business
and
industrial
expansion
well
i
think
that
debate
is
missing
an
important
point
whether
government
borrows
or
increases
taxes
it
will
be
taking
the
same
amount
of
money
from
the
private
sector
and
either
way
thats
too
much
simple
fairness
dictates
that
government
must
not
raise
taxes
on
families
struggling
to
pay
their
bills
the
root
of
the
problem
is
that
governments
share
is
more
than
we
can
afford
if
were
to
have
a
sound
economy
we
must
bring
down
the
deficits
to
ensure
continued
economic
growth
in
the
budget
that
i
will
submit
on
february
st
i
will
recommend
measures
that
will
reduce
the
deficit
over
the
next
years
many
of
these
will
be
unfinished
business
from
last
years
budget
some
could
be
enacted
quickly
if
we
could
join
in
a
serious
effort
to
address
this
problem
i
spoke
today
with
speaker
of
the
house
oneill
senate
majority
leader
baker
senate
minority
leader
byrd
and
house
minority
leader
michel
i
asked
them
if
they
would
designate
congressional
representatives
to
meet
with
representatives
of
the
administration
to
try
to
reach
prompt
agreement
on
a
bipartisan
deficit
reduction
plan
i
know
it
would
take
a
long
hard
struggle
to
agree
on
a
fullscale
plan
so
what
i
have
proposed
is
that
we
first
see
if
we
can
agree
on
a
down
payment
now
i
believe
there
is
basis
for
such
an
agreement
one
th
at
could
reduce
the
deficits
by
about
a
hundred
billion
dollars
over
the
next
years
we
could
focus
on
some
of
the
less
contentious
spending
cuts
that
are
still
pending
before
the
congress
these
could
be
combined
with
measures
to
close
certain
tax
loopholes
measures
that
the
treasury
department
has
previously
said
to
be
worthy
of
support
in
addition
we
could
examine
the
possibility
of
achieving
further
outlay
savings
based
on
the
work
of
the
grace
commission
if
the
congressional
leadership
is
willing
my
representatives
will
be
prepared
to
meet
with
theirs
at
the
earliest
possible
time
i
would
hope
the
leadership
might
agree
on
an
expedited
timetable
in
which
to
develop
and
enact
that
down
payment
but
a
down
payment
alone
is
not
enough
to
break
us
out
of
the
deficit
problem
it
could
help
us
start
on
the
right
path
yet
we
must
do
more
so
i
propose
that
we
begin
exploring
how
together
we
can
make
structural
reforms
to
curb
the
builtin
growth
of
spending
i
also
propose
improvements
in
the
budgeting
process
some
of
our
states
grant
their
governors
the
right
to
veto
individual
items
in
appropriation
bills
without
having
to
veto
the
entire
bill
california
is
one
of
those
states
as
governor
i
found
this
lineitem
veto
was
a
powerful
tool
against
wasteful
or
extravagant
spending
it
works
in
states
lets
put
it
to
work
in
washington
for
all
the
people
it
would
be
most
effective
if
done
by
constitutional
amendment
the
majority
of
americans
approve
of
such
an
amendment
just
as
they
and
i
approve
of
an
amendment
mandating
a
balanced
federal
budget
many
states
also
have
this
protection
in
their
constitutions
to
talk
of
meeting
the
present
situation
by
increasing
taxes
is
a
bandaid
solution
which
does
nothing
to
cure
an
illness
thats
been
coming
on
for
half
a
centuryto
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
it
poses
a
real
threat
to
economic
recovery
lets
remember
that
a
substantial
amount
of
income
tax
is
presently
owed
and
not
paid
by
people
in
the
underground
economy
it
would
be
immoral
to
make
those
who
are
paying
taxes
pay
more
to
compensate
for
those
who
arent
paying
their
share
theres
a
better
way
let
us
go
forward
with
an
historic
reform
for
fairness
simplicity
and
incentives
for
growth
i
am
asking
secretary
don
regan
for
a
plan
for
action
to
simplify
the
entire
tax
code
so
all
taxpayers
big
and
small
are
treated
more
fairly
and
i
believe
such
a
plan
could
result
in
that
underground
economy
being
brought
into
the
sunlight
of
honest
tax
compliance
and
it
could
make
the
tax
base
broader
so
personal
tax
rates
could
come
down
not
go
up
ive
asked
that
specific
recommendations
consistent
with
those
objectives
be
presented
to
me
by
december
our
second
great
goal
is
to
build
on
americas
pioneer
spiriti
said
something
funny
i
said
americas
next
frontierand
thats
to
develop
that
frontier
a
sparkling
economy
spurs
initiatives
sunrise
industries
and
makes
older
ones
more
competitive
nowhere
is
this
more
important
than
our
next
frontier
space
nowhere
do
we
so
effectively
demonstrate
our
technological
leadership
and
ability
to
make
life
better
on
earth
the
space
age
is
barely
a
quarter
of
a
century
old
but
already
weve
pushed
civilization
forward
with
our
advances
in
science
and
technology
opportunities
and
jobs
will
multiply
as
we
cross
new
thresholds
of
knowledge
and
reach
deeper
into
the
unknown
our
progress
in
spacetaking
giant
steps
for
all
mankindis
a
tribute
to
american
teamwork
and
excellence
our
finest
minds
in
government
industry
and
academia
have
all
pulled
together
and
we
can
be
proud
to
say
we
are
first
we
are
the
best
and
we
are
so
because
were
free
america
has
always
been
greatest
when
we
dared
to
be
great
we
can
reach
for
greatness
again
we
can
follow
our
dreams
to
distant
stars
living
and
working
in
space
for
peaceful
economic
and
scientific
gain
tonight
i
am
directing
nasa
to
develop
a
permanently
manned
space
station
and
to
do
it
within
a
decade
a
space
station
will
permit
quantum
leaps
in
our
research
in
science
communications
in
metals
and
in
lifesaving
medicines
which
could
be
manufactured
only
in
space
we
want
our
friends
to
help
us
meet
these
challenges
and
share
in
their
benefits
nasa
will
invite
other
countries
to
participate
so
we
can
strengthen
peace
build
prosperity
and
expand
freedom
for
all
who
share
our
goals
just
as
the
oceans
opened
up
a
new
world
for
clipper
ships
and
yankee
traders
space
holds
enormous
potential
for
commerce
today
the
market
for
space
transportation
could
surpass
our
capacity
to
develop
it
companies
interested
in
putting
payloads
into
space
must
have
ready
access
to
private
sector
launch
services
the
department
of
transportation
will
help
an
expendable
launch
services
industry
to
get
off
the
ground
well
soon
implement
a
number
of
executive
initiatives
develop
proposals
to
ease
regulatory
constraints
and
with
nasas
help
promote
private
sector
investment
in
space
and
as
we
develop
the
frontier
of
space
let
us
remember
our
responsibility
to
preserve
our
older
resources
here
on
earth
preservation
of
our
environment
is
not
a
liberal
or
conservative
challenge
its
common
sense
though
this
is
a
time
of
budget
constraints
i
have
requested
for
epa
one
of
the
largest
percentage
budget
increases
of
any
agency
we
will
begin
the
long
necessary
effort
to
clean
up
a
productive
recreational
area
and
a
special
national
resourcethe
chesapeake
bay
to
reduce
the
threat
posed
by
abandoned
hazardous
waste
dumps
epa
will
spend
million
and
i
will
request
a
supplemental
increase
of
million
and
because
the
superfund
law
expires
in
ive
asked
bill
ruckelshaus
to
develop
a
proposal
for
its
extension
so
therell
be
additional
time
to
complete
this
important
task
on
the
question
of
acid
rain
which
concerns
people
in
many
areas
of
the
united
states
and
canada
im
proposing
a
research
program
that
doubles
our
current
funding
and
well
take
additional
action
to
restore
our
lakes
and
develop
new
technology
to
reduce
pollution
that
causes
acid
rain
we
have
greatly
improved
the
conditions
of
our
natural
resources
well
ask
the
congress
for
million
beginning
in
to
acquire
new
park
and
conservation
lands
the
department
of
the
interior
will
encourage
careful
selective
exploration
and
production
on
our
vital
resources
in
an
exclusive
economic
zone
within
the
mile
limit
off
our
coastsbut
with
strict
adherence
to
environmental
laws
and
with
fuller
state
and
public
participation
but
our
most
precious
resources
our
greatest
hope
for
the
future
are
the
minds
and
hearts
of
our
people
especially
our
children
we
can
help
them
build
tomorrow
by
strengthening
our
community
of
shared
values
this
must
be
our
third
great
goal
for
us
faith
work
family
neighborhood
freedom
and
peace
are
not
just
words
theyre
expressions
of
what
america
means
definitions
of
what
makes
us
a
good
and
loving
people
families
stand
at
the
center
of
our
society
and
every
family
has
a
personal
stake
in
promoting
excellence
in
education
excellence
does
not
begin
in
washington
a
percent
increase
in
federal
spending
on
education
between
and
was
accompanied
by
a
steady
decline
in
scholastic
aptitude
test
scores
excellence
must
begin
in
our
homes
and
neighborhood
schools
where
its
the
responsibility
of
every
parent
and
teacher
and
the
right
of
every
child
our
children
come
first
and
thats
why
i
established
a
bipartisan
national
commission
on
excellence
in
education
to
help
us
chart
a
commonsense
course
for
better
education
and
already
communities
are
implementing
the
commissions
recommendations
schools
are
reporting
progress
in
math
and
reading
skills
but
we
must
do
more
to
restore
discipline
to
schools
and
we
must
encourage
the
teaching
of
new
basics
reward
teachers
of
merit
enforce
tougher
standards
and
put
our
parents
back
in
charge
i
will
continue
to
press
for
tuition
tax
credits
to
expand
opportunities
for
families
and
to
soften
the
double
payment
for
those
paying
public
school
taxes
and
private
school
tuition
our
proposal
would
target
assistance
to
low
and
middleincome
families
just
as
more
incentives
are
needed
within
our
schools
greater
competition
is
needed
among
our
schools
without
standards
and
competition
there
can
be
no
champions
no
records
broken
no
excellence
in
education
or
any
other
walk
of
life
and
while
im
on
this
subject
each
day
your
members
observe
a
yearold
tradition
meant
to
signify
america
is
one
nation
under
god
i
must
ask
if
you
can
begin
your
day
with
a
member
of
the
clergy
standing
right
here
leading
you
in
prayer
then
why
cant
freedom
to
acknowledge
god
be
enjoyed
again
by
children
in
every
schoolroom
across
this
land
america
was
founded
by
people
who
believed
that
god
was
their
rock
of
safety
he
is
ours
i
recognize
we
must
be
cautious
in
claiming
that
god
is
on
our
side
but
i
think
its
all
right
to
keep
asking
if
were
on
his
side
during
our
first
years
we
have
joined
bipartisan
efforts
to
restore
protection
of
the
law
to
unborn
children
now
i
know
this
issue
is
very
controversial
but
unless
and
until
it
can
be
proven
that
an
unborn
child
is
not
a
living
human
being
can
we
justify
assuming
without
proof
that
it
isnt
no
one
has
yet
offered
such
proof
indeed
all
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary
we
should
rise
above
bitterness
and
reproach
and
if
americans
could
come
together
in
a
spirit
of
understanding
and
helping
then
we
could
find
positive
solutions
to
the
tragedy
of
abortion
economic
recovery
better
education
rededication
to
values
all
show
the
spirit
of
renewal
gaining
the
upper
hand
and
all
will
improve
family
life
in
the
eighties
but
families
need
more
they
need
assurance
that
they
and
their
loved
ones
can
walk
the
streets
of
america
without
being
afraid
parents
need
to
know
their
children
will
not
be
victims
of
child
pornography
and
abduction
this
year
we
will
intensify
our
drive
against
these
and
other
horrible
crimes
like
sexual
abuse
and
family
violence
already
our
efforts
to
crack
down
on
career
criminals
organized
crime
drugpushers
and
to
enforce
tougher
sentences
and
paroles
are
having
effect
in
the
crime
rate
dropped
by
percent
the
bigge
st
decline
since
protecting
victims
is
just
as
important
as
safeguarding
the
rights
of
defendants
opportunities
for
all
americans
will
increase
if
we
move
forward
in
fair
housing
and
work
to
ensure
womens
rights
provide
for
equitable
treatment
in
pension
benefits
and
individual
retirement
accounts
facilitate
child
care
and
enforce
delinquent
parent
support
payments
its
not
just
the
home
but
the
workplace
and
community
that
sustain
our
values
and
shape
our
future
so
i
ask
your
help
in
assisting
more
communities
to
break
the
bondage
of
dependency
help
us
to
free
enterprise
by
permitting
debate
and
voting
yes
on
our
proposal
for
enterprise
zones
in
america
this
has
been
before
you
for
years
its
passage
can
help
highunemployment
areas
by
creating
jobs
and
restoring
neighborhoods
a
society
bursting
with
opportunities
reaching
for
its
future
with
confidence
sustained
by
faith
fair
play
and
a
conviction
that
good
and
courageous
people
will
flourish
when
theyre
freethese
are
the
secrets
of
a
strong
and
prosperous
america
at
peace
with
itself
and
the
world
a
lasting
and
meaningful
peace
is
our
fourth
great
goal
it
is
our
highest
aspiration
and
our
record
is
clear
americans
resort
to
force
only
when
we
must
we
have
never
been
aggressors
we
have
always
struggled
to
defend
freedom
and
democracy
we
have
no
territorial
ambitions
we
occupy
no
countries
we
build
no
walls
to
lock
people
in
americans
build
the
future
and
our
vision
of
a
better
life
for
farmers
merchants
and
working
people
from
the
americas
to
asia
begins
with
a
simple
premise
the
future
is
best
decided
by
ballots
not
bullets
governments
which
rest
upon
the
consent
of
the
governed
do
not
wage
war
on
their
neighbors
only
when
people
are
given
a
personal
stake
in
deciding
their
own
destiny
benefiting
from
their
own
risks
do
they
create
societies
that
are
prosperous
progressive
and
free
tonight
it
is
democracies
that
offer
hope
by
feeding
the
hungry
prolonging
life
and
eliminating
drudgery
when
it
comes
to
keeping
america
strong
free
and
at
peace
there
should
be
no
republicans
or
democrats
just
patriotic
americans
we
can
decide
the
tough
issues
not
by
who
is
right
but
by
what
is
right
together
we
can
continue
to
advance
our
agenda
for
peace
we
can
establish
a
more
stable
basis
for
peaceful
relations
with
the
soviet
union
strengthen
allied
relations
across
the
board
achieve
real
and
equitable
reductions
in
the
levels
of
nuclear
arms
reinforce
our
peacemaking
efforts
in
the
middle
east
central
america
and
southern
africa
or
assist
developing
countries
particularly
our
neighbors
in
the
western
hemisphere
and
assist
in
the
development
of
democratic
institutions
throughout
the
world
the
wisdom
of
our
bipartisan
cooperation
was
seen
in
the
work
of
the
scowcroft
commission
which
strengthened
our
ability
to
deter
war
and
protect
peace
in
that
same
spirit
i
urge
you
to
move
forward
with
the
henry
jackson
plan
to
implement
the
recommendations
of
the
bipartisan
commission
on
central
america
your
joint
resolution
on
the
multinational
peacekeeping
force
in
lebanon
is
also
serving
the
cause
of
peace
we
are
making
progress
in
lebanon
for
nearly
years
the
lebanese
have
lived
from
tragedy
to
tragedy
with
no
hope
for
their
future
now
the
multinational
peacekeeping
force
and
our
marines
are
helping
them
break
their
cycle
of
despair
there
is
hope
for
a
free
independent
and
sovereign
lebanon
we
must
have
the
courage
to
give
peace
a
chance
and
we
must
not
be
driven
from
our
objectives
for
peace
in
lebanon
by
statesponsored
terrorism
we
have
seen
this
ugly
specter
in
beirut
kuwait
and
rangoon
it
demands
international
attention
i
will
forward
shortly
legislative
proposals
to
help
combat
terrorism
and
i
will
be
seeking
support
from
our
allies
for
concerted
action
our
nato
alliance
is
strong
was
a
banner
year
for
political
courage
and
we
have
strengthened
our
partnerships
and
our
friendships
in
the
far
east
were
committed
to
dialog
deterrence
and
promoting
prosperity
well
work
with
our
trading
partners
for
a
new
round
of
negotiations
in
support
of
freer
world
trade
greater
competition
and
more
open
markets
a
rebirth
of
bipartisan
cooperation
of
economic
growth
and
military
deterrence
and
a
growing
spirit
of
unity
among
our
people
at
home
and
our
allies
abroad
underline
a
fundamental
and
farreaching
change
the
united
states
is
safer
stronger
and
more
secure
in
than
before
we
can
now
move
with
confidence
to
seize
the
opportunities
for
peace
and
we
will
tonight
i
want
to
speak
to
the
people
of
the
soviet
union
to
tell
them
its
true
that
our
governments
have
had
serious
differences
but
our
sons
and
daughters
have
never
fought
each
other
in
war
and
if
we
americans
have
our
way
they
never
will
people
of
the
soviet
union
there
is
only
one
sane
policy
for
your
country
and
mine
to
preserve
our
civilization
in
this
modern
age
a
nuclear
war
cannot
be
won
and
must
never
be
fought
the
only
value
in
our
two
nations
possessing
nuclear
weapons
is
to
make
sure
they
will
never
be
used
but
then
would
it
not
be
better
to
do
away
with
them
entirely
people
of
the
soviet
president
dwight
eisenhower
who
fought
by
your
side
in
world
war
ii
said
the
essential
struggle
is
not
merely
man
against
man
or
nation
against
nation
it
is
man
against
war
americans
are
people
of
peace
if
your
government
wants
peace
there
will
be
peace
we
can
come
together
in
faith
and
friendship
to
build
a
safer
and
far
better
world
for
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
and
the
whole
world
will
rejoice
that
is
my
message
to
you
some
days
when
life
seems
hard
and
we
reach
out
for
values
to
sustain
us
or
a
friend
to
help
us
we
find
a
person
who
reminds
us
what
it
means
to
be
americans
sergeant
stephen
trujillo
a
medic
in
the
d
ranger
battalion
th
infantry
was
in
the
first
helicopter
to
land
at
the
compound
held
by
cuban
forces
in
grenada
he
saw
three
other
helicopters
crash
despite
the
imminent
explosion
of
the
burning
aircraft
he
never
hesitated
he
ran
across
yards
of
open
terrain
through
enemy
fire
to
rescue
wounded
soldiers
he
directed
two
other
medics
administered
first
aid
and
returned
again
and
again
to
the
crash
site
to
carry
his
wounded
friends
to
safety
sergeant
trujillo
you
and
your
fellow
service
men
and
women
not
only
saved
innocent
lives
you
set
a
nation
free
you
inspire
us
as
a
force
for
freedom
not
for
despotism
and
yes
for
peace
not
conquest
god
bless
you
and
then
there
are
unsung
heroes
single
parents
couples
church
and
civic
volunteers
their
hearts
carry

the

they
soothe

how
can
we
not
believe
in
the
greatness
of
america
how
can
we
not

is

honored

and
fellow
citizens
this
solemn
occasion
marks
the
th
time
that
a
president
of
the
united
states
has
reported
on
the
state
of
the
union
since
george
washington
first
did
so
in
thats
a
lot
of
reports
but
theres
no
shortage
of
new
things
to
say
about
the
state
of
the
union
the
very
key
to
our
success
has
been
our
ability
foremost
among
nations
to
preserve
our
lasting
values
by
making
change
work
for
us
rather
than
against
us
i
would
like
to
talk
with
you
this
evening
about
what
we
can
do
togethernot
as
republicans
and
democrats
but
as
americansto
make
tomorrows
america
happy
and
prosperous
at
home
strong
and
respected
abroad
and
at
peace
in
the
world
as
we
gather
here
tonight
the
state
of
our
union
is
strong
but
our
economy
is
troubled
for
too
many
of
our
fellow
citizensfarmers
steel
and
auto
workers
lumbermen
black
teenagers
working
mothersthis
is
a
painful
period
we
must
all
do
everything
in
our
power
to
bring
their
ordeal
to
an
end
it
has
fallen
to
us
in
our
time
to
undo
damage
that
was
a
long
time
in
the
making
and
to
begin
the
hard
but
necessary
task
of
building
a
better
future
for
ourselves
and
our
children
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
but
thanks
to
the
courage
patience
and
strength
of
our
people
america
is
on
the
mend
but
let
me
give
you
just
one
important
reason
why
i
believe
thisit
involves
many
members
of
this
body
just
days
ago
after
months
of
debate
and
deadlock
the
bipartisan
commission
on
social
security
accomplished
the
seemingly
impossible
social
security
as
some
of
us
had
warned
for
so
long
faced
disaster
i
myself
have
been
talking
about
this
problem
for
almost
years
as
began
the
system
stood
on
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
a
double
victim
of
our
economic
ills
first
a
decade
of
rampant
inflation
drained
its
reserves
as
we
tried
to
protect
beneficiaries
from
the
spiraling
cost
of
living
then
the
recession
and
the
sudden
end
of
inflation
withered
the
expanding
wage
base
and
increasing
revenues
the
system
needs
to
support
the
million
americans
who
depend
on
it
when
the
speaker
of
the
house
the
senate
majority
leader
and
i
performed
the
bipartisanor
formed
the
bipartisan
commission
on
social
security
pundits
and
experts
predicted
that
party
divisions
and
conflicting
interests
would
prevent
the
commission
from
agreeing
on
a
plan
to
save
social
security
well
sometimes
even
here
in
washington
the
cynics
are
wrong
through
compromise
and
cooperation
the
members
of
the
commission
overcame
their
differences
and
achieved
a
fair
workable
plan
they
proved
that
when
it
comes
to
the
national
welfare
americans
can
still
pull
together
for
the
common
good
tonight
im
especially
pleased
to
join
with
the
speaker
and
the
senate
majority
leader
in
urging
the
congress
to
enact
this
plan
by
easter
there
are
elements
in
it
of
course
that
none
of
us
prefers
but
taken
together
it
performs
a
package
that
all
of
us
can
support
it
asks
for
some
sacrifice
by
allthe
selfemployed
beneficiaries
workers
government
employees
and
the
betteroff
among
the
retiredbut
it
imposes
an
undue
burden
on
none
and
in
supporting
it
we
keep
an
important
pledge
to
the
american
people
the
integrity
of
the
social
security
system
will
be
preserved
and
no
ones
payments
will
be
reduced
the
commissions
plan
will
do
the
job
indeed
it
must
do
the
job
we
owe
it
to
todays
older
americans
and
todays
younger
workers
so
before
we
go
any
further
i
ask
you
to
join
with
me
in
saluting
the
members
of
the
commission
who
are
here
tonight
and
senate
majority
leader
howard
baker
and
speaker
tip
oneill
for
a
job
well
done
i
hope
and
pray
the
bipartisan
spirit
that
guided
you
in
this
endeavor
will
inspire
all
of
us
as
we
face
the
challenges
of
the
year
ahead
nearly
half
a
century
ago
in
this
chamber
another
american
president
franklin
delano
roosevelt
in
his
second
state
of
the
union
message
urged
america
to
look
to
the
future
to
meet
the
challenge
of
change
and
the
need
for
leadership
that
looks
forward
not
backward
throughout
the
world
he
said
change
is
the
order
of
the
day
in
every
nation
economic
problems
long
in
the
making
have
brought
crises
to
of
many
kinds
for
which
the
masters
of
old
practice
and
theory
were
unprepared
he
also
reminded
us
that
the
future
lies
with
those
wise
political
leaders
who
realize
that
the
great
public
is
interested
more
in
government
than
in
politics
so
let
us
in
these
next
yearsmen
and
women
of
both
parties
every
political
shadeconcentrate
on
the
longrange
bipartisan
responsibilities
of
government
not
the
shortrange
or
shortterm
temptations
of
partisan
politics
the
problems
we
inherited
were
far
worse
than
most
inside
and
out
of
government
had
expected
the
recession
was
deeper
than
most
inside
and
out
of
government
had
predicted
curing
those
problems
has
taken
more
time
and
a
higher
toll
than
any
of
us
wanted
unemployment
is
far
too
high
projected
federal
spendingif
government
refuses
to
tighten
its
own
beltwill
also
be
far
too
high
and
could
weaken
and
shorten
the
economic
recovery
now
underway
this
recovery
will
bring
with
it
a
revival
of
economic
confidence
and
spending
for
consumer
items
and
capital
goodsthe
stimulus
we
need
to
restart
our
stalled
economic
engines
the
american
people
have
already
stepped
up
their
rate
of
saving
assuring
that
the
funds
needed
to
modernize
our
factories
and
improve
our
technology
will
once
again
flow
to
business
and
industry
the
inflationary
expectations
that
led
to
a
percent
interest
prime
rate
and
soaring
mortgage
rates
years
ago
are
now
reduced
by
almost
half
leaders
have
started
to
realize
that
doubledigit
inflation
is
no
longer
a
way
of
life
i
misspoke
there
i
should
have
said
lenders
so
interest
rates
have
tumbled
paving
the
way
for
recovery
in
vital
industries
like
housing
and
autos
the
early
evidence
of
that
recovery
has
started
coming
in
housing
starts
for
the
fourth
quarter
of
were
up
percent
from
a
year
ago
and
housing
permits
a
sure
indicator
of
future
growth
were
up
a
whopping
percent
were
witnessing
an
upsurge
of
productivity
and
impressive
evidence
that
american
industry
will
once
again
become
competitive
in
markets
at
home
and
abroad
ensuring
more
jobs
and
better
incomes
for
the
nations
work
force
but
our
confidence
must
also
be
tempered
by
realism
and
patience
quick
fixes
and
artificial
stimulants
repeatedly
applied
over
decades
are
what
brought
us
the
inflationary
disorders
that
weve
now
paid
such
a
heavy
price
to
cure
the
permanent
recovery
in
employment
production
and
investment
we
seek
wont
come
in
a
sharp
short
spurt
itll
build
carefully
and
steadily
in
the
months
and
years
ahead
in
the
meantime
the
challenge
of
government
is
to
identify
the
things
that
we
can
do
now
to
ease
the
massive
economic
transition
for
the
american
people
the
federal
budget
is
both
a
symptom
and
a
cause
of
our
economic
problems
unless
we
reduce
the
dangerous
growth
rate
in
government
spending
we
could
face
the
prospect
of
sluggish
economic
growth
into
the
indefinite
future
failure
to
cope
with
this
problem
now
could
mean
as
much
as
a
trillion
dollars
more
in
national
debt
in
the
next
years
alone
that
would
average
in
additional
debt
for
every
man
woman
child
and
baby
in
our
nation
to
assure
a
sustained
recovery
we
must
continue
getting
runaway
spending
under
control
to
bring
those
deficits
down
if
we
dont
the
recovery
will
be
too
short
unemployment
will
remain
too
high
and
we
will
leave
an
unconscionable
burden
of
national
debt
for
our
children
that
we
must
not
do
lets
be
clear
about
where
the
deficit
problem
comes
from
contrary
to
the
drumbeat
weve
been
hearing
for
the
last
few
months
the
deficits
we
face
are
not
rooted
in
defense
spending
taken
as
a
percentage
of
the
gross
national
product
our
defense
spending
happens
to
be
only
about
fourfifths
of
what
it
was
in
nor
is
the
deficit
as
some
would
have
it
rooted
in
tax
cuts
even
with
our
tax
cuts
taxes
as
a
fraction
of
gross
national
product
remain
about
the
same
as
they
were
in
the
fact
is
our
deficits
come
from
the
uncontrolled
growth
of
the
budget
for
domestic
spending
during
the
s
the
share
of
our
national
income
devoted
to
this
domestic
spending
increased
by
more
than
percent
from
cents
out
of
every
dollar
produced
by
the
american
people
to
cents
in
spite
of
all
our
economies
and
efficiencies
and
without
adding
any
new
programs
basic
necessary
domestic
spending
provided
for
in
this
years
budget
will
grow
to
almost
a
trillion
dollars
over
the
next
years
the
deficit
problem
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
basic
health
of
our
republic
we
need
a
plan
to
overcome
this
dangera
plan
based
on
these
principles
it
must
be
bipartisan
conquering
the
deficits
and
putting
the
governments
house
in
order
will
require
the
best
effort
of
all
of
us
it
must
be
fair
just
as
all
will
share
in
the
benefits
that
will
come
from
recovery
all
would
share
fairly
in
the
burden
of
transition
it
must
be
prudent
the
strength
of
our
national
defense
must
be
restored
so
that
we
can
pursue
prosperity
and
peace
and
freedom
while
maintaining
our
commitment
to
the
truly
needy
and
finally
it
must
be
realistic
we
cant
rely
on
hope
alone
with
these
guiding
principles
in
mind
let
me
outline
a
fourpart
plan
to
increase
economic
growth
and
reduce
deficits
first
in
my
budget
message
i
will
recommend
a
federal
spending
freeze
i
know
this
is
strong
medicine
but
so
far
we
have
only
cut
the
rate
of
increase
in
federal
spending
the
government
has
continued
to
spend
more
money
each
year
though
not
as
much
more
as
it
did
in
the
past
taken
as
a
whole
the
budget
im
proposing
for
the
fiscal
year
will
increase
no
more
than
the
rate
of
inflation
in
other
words
the
federal
government
will
hold
the
line
on
real
spending
now
thats
far
less
than
many
american
families
have
had
to
do
in
these
difficult
times
i
will
request
that
the
proposed
month
freeze
in
costofliving
adjustments
recommended
by
the
bipartisan
social
security
commission
be
applied
to
other
governmentrelated
retirement
programs
i
will
also
propose
a
year
freeze
on
a
broad

range
of
domestic
spending
programs
and
for
federal
civilian
and
military
pay
and
pension
programs
and
let
me
say
right
here
im
sorry
with
regard
to
the
military
in
asking
that
of
them
because
for
so
many
years
they
have
been
so
far
behind
and
so
low
in
reward
for
what
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
doing
but
im
sure
they
will
understand
that
this
must
be
across
the
board
and
fair
second
i
will
ask
the
congress
to
adopt
specific
measures
to
control
the
growth
of
the
socalled
uncontrollable
spending
programs
these
are
the
automatic
spending
programs
such
as
food
stamps
that
cannot
be
simply
frozen
and
that
have
grown
by
over
percent
since
they
are
the
largest
single
cause
of
the
builtin
or
structural
deficit
problem
our
standard
here
will
be
fairness
ensuring
that
the
taxpayers
hardearned
dollars
go
only
to
the
truly
needy
that
none
of
them
are
turned
away
but
that
fraud
and
waste
are
stamped
out
and
im
sorry
to
say
theres
a
lot
of
it
out
there
in
the
food
stamp
program
alone
last
year
we
identified
almost
billion
in
overpayments
the
taxpayers
arent
the
only
victims
of
this
kind
of
abuse
the
truly
needy
suffer
as
funds
intended
for
them
are
taken
not
by
the
needy
but
by
the
greedy
for
everyones
sake
we
must
put
an
end
to
such
waste
and
corruption
third
i
will
adjust
our
program
to
restore
americas
defenses
by
proposing
billion
in
defense
savings
over
the
next
years
these
are
savings
recommended
to
me
by
the
secretary
of
defense
who
has
assured
me
they
can
be
safely
achieved
and
will
not
diminish
our
ability
to
negotiate
arms
reductions
or
endanger
americas
security
we
will
not
gamble
with
our
national
survival
and
fourth
because
we
must
ensure
reduction
and
eventual
elimination
of
deficits
over
the
next
several
years
i
will
propose
a
standby
tax
limited
to
no
more
than
percent
of
the
gross
national
product
to
start
in
fiscal
it
would
last
no
more
than
years
and
it
would
start
only
if
the
congress
has
first
approved
our
spending
freeze
and
budget
control
program
and
there
are
several
other
conditions
also
that
must
be
met
all
of
them
in
order
for
this
program
to
be
triggered
now
you
could
say
that
this
is
an
insurance
policy
for
the
future
a
remedy
that
will
be
at
hand
if
needed
but
only
resorted
to
if
absolutely
necessary
in
the
meantime
well
continue
to
study
ways
to
simplify
the
tax
code
and
make
it
more
fair
for
all
americans
this
is
a
goal
that
every
american
whos
ever
struggled
with
a
tax
form
can
understand
at
the
same
time
however
i
will
oppose
any
efforts
to
undo
the
basic
tax
reforms
that
weve
already
enacted
including
the
percent
tax
break
coming
to
taxpayers
this
july
and
the
tax
indexing
which
will
protect
all
americans
from
inflationary
bracket
creep
in
the
years
ahead
now
i
realize
that
this
fourpart
plan
is
easier
to
describe
than
it
will
be
to
enact
but
the
looming
deficits
that
hang
over
us
and
over
americas
future
must
be
reduced
the
path
ive
outlined
is
fair
balanced
and
realistic
if
enacted
it
will
ensure
a
steady
decline
in
deficits
aiming
toward
a
balanced
budget
by
the
end
of
the
decade
its
the
only
path
that
will
lead
to
a
strong
sustained
recovery
let
us
follow
that
path
together
no
domestic
challenge
is
more
crucial
than
providing
stable
permanent
jobs
for
all
americans
who
want
to
work
the
recovery
program
will
provide
jobs
for
most
but
others
will
need
special
help
and
training
for
new
skills
shortly
i
will
submit
to
the
congress
the
employment
act
of
designed
to
get
at
the
special
problems
of
the
longterm
unemployed
as
well
as
young
people
trying
to
enter
the
job
market
ill
propose
extending
unemployment
benefits
including
special
incentives
to
employers
who
hire
the
longterm
unemployed
providing
programs
for
displaced
workers
and
helping
federally
funded
and
stateadministered
unemployment
insurance
programs
provide
workers
with
training
and
relocation
assistance
finally
our
proposal
will
include
new
incentives
for
summer
youth
employment
to
help
young
people
get
a
start
in
the
job
market
we
must
offer
both
shortterm
help
and
longterm
hope
for
our
unemployed
i
hope
we
can
work
together
on
this
i
hope
we
can
work
together
as
we
did
last
year
in
enacting
the
landmark
job
training
partnership
act
regulatory
reform
legislation
a
responsible
clean
air
act
and
passage
of
enterprise
zone
legislation
will
also
create
new
incentives
for
jobs
and
opportunity
one
of
out
of
every
five
jobs
in
our
country
depends
on
trade
so
i
will
propose
a
broader
strategy
in
the
field
of
international
tradeone
that
increases
the
openness
of
our
trading
system
and
is
fairer
to
americas
farmers
and
workers
in
the
world
marketplace
we
must
have
adequate
export
financing
to
sell
american
products
overseas
i
will
ask
for
new
negotiating
authority
to
remove
barriers
and
to
get
more
of
our
products
into
foreign
markets
we
must
strengthen
the
organization
of
our
trade
agencies
and
make
changes
in
our
domestic
laws
and
international
trade
policy
to
promote
free
trade
and
the
increased
flow
of
american
goods
services
and
investments
our
trade
position
can
also
be
improved
by
making
our
port
system
more
efficient
better
more
active
harbors
translate
into
stable
jobs
in
our
coalfields
railroads
trucking
industry
and
ports
after
years
of
debate
its
time
for
us
to
get
together
and
enact
a
port
modernization
bill
education
training
and
retraining
are
fundamental
to
our
success
as
are
research
and
development
and
productivity
labor
management
and
government
at
all
levels
can
and
must
participate
in
improving
these
tools
of
growth
tax
policy
regulatory
practices
and
government
programs
all
need
constant
reevaluation
in
terms
of
our
competitiveness
every
american
has
a
role
and
a
stake
in
international
trade
we
americans
are
still
the
technological
leaders
in
most
fields
we
must
keep
that
edge
and
to
do
so
we
need
to
begin
renewing
the
basicsstarting
with
our
educational
system
while
we
grew
complacent
others
have
acted
japan
with
a
population
only
about
half
the
size
of
ours
graduates
from
its
universities
more
engineers
than
we
do
if
a
child
doesnt
receive
adequate
math
and
science
teaching
by
the
age
of
he
or
she
has
lost
the
chance
to
be
a
scientist
or
an
engineer
we
must
join
togetherparents
teachers
grass
roots
groups
organized
labor
and
the
business
communityto
revitalize
american
education
by
setting
a
standard
of
excellence
in
we
seek
four
major
education
goals
a
quality
education
initiative
to
encourage
a
substantial
upgrading
of
math
and
science
instruction
through
block
grants
to
the
states
establishment
of
education
savings
accounts
that
will
give
middle
and
lowerincome
families
an
incentive
to
save
for
their
childrens
college
education
and
at
the
same
time
encourage
a
real
increase
in
savings
for
economic
growth
passage
of
tuition
tax
credits
for
parents
who
want
to
send
their
children
to
private
or
religiously
affiliated
schools
a
constitutional
amendment
to
permit
voluntary
school
prayer
god
should
never
have
been
expelled
from
americas
classrooms
in
the
first
place
our
commitment
to
fairness
means
that
we
must
assure
legal
and
economic
equity
for
women
and
eliminate
once
and
for
all
all
traces
of
unjust
discrimination
against
women
from
the
united
states
code
we
will
not
tolerate
wage
discrimination
based
on
sex
and
we
intend
to
strengthen
enforcement
of
child
support
laws
to
ensure
that
single
parents
most
of
whom
are
women
do
not
suffer
unfair
financial
hardship
we
will
also
take
action
to
remedy
inequities
in
pensions
these
initiatives
will
be
joined
by
others
to
continue
our
efforts
to
promote
equity
for
women
also
in
the
area
of
fairness
and
equity
we
will
ask
for
extension
of
the
civil
rights
commission
which
is
due
to
expire
this
year
the
commission
is
an
important
part
of
the
ongoing
struggle
for
justice
in
america
and
we
strongly
support
its
reauthorization
effective
enforcement
of
our
nations
fair
housing
laws
is
also
essential
to
ensuring
equal
opportunity
in
the
year
ahead
well
work
to
strengthen
enforcement
of
fair
housing
laws
for
all
americans
the
time
has
also
come
for
major
reform
of
our
criminal
justice
statutes
and
acceleration
of
the
drive
against
organized
crime
and
drug
trafficking
its
high
time
that
we
make
our
cities
safe
again
this
administration
hereby
declares
an
allout
war
on
bigtime
organized
crime
and
the
drug
racketeers
who
are
poisoning
our
young
people
we
will
also
implement
recommendations
of
our
task
force
on
victims
of
crime
which
will
report
to
me
this
week
american
agriculture
the
envy
of
the
world
has
become
the
victim
of
its
own
successes
with
one
farmer
now
producing
enough
food
to
feed
himself
and
other
people
america
is
confronted
with
record
surplus
crops
and
commodity
prices
below
the
cost
of
production
we
must
strive
through
innovations
like
the
paymentinkind
crop
swap
approach
and
an
aggressive
export
policy
to
restore
health
and
vitality
to
rural
america
meanwhile
i
have
instructed
the
department
of
agriculture
to
work
individually
with
farmers
with
debt
problems
to
help
them
through
these
tough
times
over
the
past
year
our
task
force
on
private
sector
initiatives
has
successfully
forged
a
working
partnership
involving
leaders
of
business
labor
education
and
government
to
address
the
training
needs
of
american
workers
thanks
to
the
task
force
private
sector
initiatives
are
now
underway
in
all
states
of
the
union
and
thousands
of
working
people
have
been
helped
in
making
the
shift
from
deadend
jobs
and
lowdemand
skills
to
the
growth
areas
of
high
technology
and
the
service
economy
additionally
a
major
effort
will
be
focused
on
encouraging
the
expansion
of
private
community
child
care
the
new
advisory
council
on
private
sector
initiatives
will
carry
on
and
extend
this
vital
work
of
encouraging
private
initiative
in
in
the
coming
year
we
will
also
act
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
americans
by
curbing
the
skyrocketing
cost
of
health
care
that
is
becoming
an
unbearable
financial
burden
for
so
many
and
we
will
submit
legislation
to
provide
catastrophic
illne
ss
insurance
coverage
for
older
americans
i
will
also
shortly
submit
a
comprehensive
federalism
proposal
that
will
continue
our
efforts
to
restore
to
states
and
local
governments
their
roles
as
dynamic
laboratories
of
change
in
a
creative
society
during
the
next
several
weeks
i
will
send
to
the
congress
a
series
of
detailed
proposals
on
these
and
other
topics
and
look
forward
to
working
with
you
on
the
development
of
these
initiatives
so
far
now
ive
concentrated
mainly
on
the
problems
posed
by
the
future
but
in
almost
every
home
and
workplace
in
america
were
already
witnessing
reason
for
great
hopethe
first
flowering
of
the
manmade
miracles
of
high
technology
a
field
pioneered
and
still
led
by
our
country
to
many
of
us
now
computers
silicon
chips
data
processing
cybernetics
and
all
the
other
innovations
of
the
dawning
high
technology
age
are
as
mystifying
as
the
workings
of
the
combustion
engine
must
have
been
when
that
first
model
t
rattled
down
main
street
usa
but
as
surely
as
americas
pioneer
spirit
made
us
the
industrial
giant
of
the
th
century
the
same
pioneer
spirit
today
is
opening
up
on
another
vast
front
of
opportunity
the
frontier
of
high
technology
in
conquering
the
frontier
we
cannot
write
off
our
traditional
industries
but
we
must
develop
the
skills
and
industries
that
will
make
us
a
pioneer
of
tomorrow
this
administration
is
committed
to
keeping
america
the
technological
leader
of
the
world
now
and
into
the
st
century
but
let
us
turn
briefly
to
the
international
arena
americas
leadership
in
the
world
came
to
us
because
of
our
own
strength
and
because
of
the
values
which
guide
us
as
a
society
free
elections
a
free
press
freedom
of
religious
choice
free
trade
unions
and
above
all
freedom
for
the
individual
and
rejection
of
the
arbitrary
power
of
the
state
these
values
are
the
bedrock
of
our
strength
they
unite
us
in
a
stewardship
of
peace
and
freedom
with
our
allies
and
friends
in
nato
in
asia
in
latin
america
and
elsewhere
they
are
also
the
values
which
in
the
recent
past
some
among
us
had
begun
to
doubt
and
view
with
a
cynical
eye
fortunately
we
and
our
allies
have
rediscovered
the
strength
of
our
common
democratic
values
and
were
applying
them
as
a
cornerstone
of
a
comprehensive
strategy
for
peace
with
freedom
in
london
last
year
i
announced
the
commitment
of
the
united
states
to
developing
the
infrastructure
of
democracy
throughout
the
world
we
intend
to
pursue
this
democratic
initiative
vigorously
the
future
belongs
not
to
governments
and
ideologies
which
oppress
their
peoples
but
to
democratic
systems
of
selfgovernment
which
encourage
individual
initiative
and
guarantee
personal
freedom
but
our
strategy
for
peace
with
freedom
must
also
be
based
on
strengtheconomic
strength
and
military
strength
a
strong
american
economy
is
essential
to
the
wellbeing
and
security
of
our
friends
and
allies
the
restoration
of
a
strong
healthy
american
economy
has
been
and
remains
one
of
the
central
pillars
of
our
foreign
policy
the
progress
ive
been
able
to
report
to
you
tonight
will
i
know
be
as
warmly
welcomed
by
the
rest
of
the
world
as
it
is
by
the
american
people
we
must
also
recognize
that
our
own
economic
wellbeing
is
inextricably
linked
to
the
world
economy
we
export
over
percent
of
our
industrial
production
and
percent
of
our
farmland
produces
for
export
we
will
continue
to
work
closely
with
the
industrialized
democracies
of
europe
and
japan
and
with
the
international
monetary
fund
to
ensure
it
has
adequate
resources
to
help
bring
the
world
economy
back
to
strong
noninflationary
growth
as
the
leader
of
the
west
and
as
a
country
that
has
become
great
and
rich
because
of
economic
freedom
america
must
be
an
unrelenting
advocate
of
free
trade
as
some
nations
are
tempted
to
turn
to
protectionism
our
strategy
cannot
be
to
follow
them
but
to
lead
the
way
toward
freer
trade
to
this
end
in
may
of
this
year
america
will
host
an
economic
summit
meeting
in
williamsburg
virginia
as
we
begin
our
third
year
we
have
put
in
place
a
defense
program
that
redeems
the
neglect
of
the
past
decade
we
have
developed
a
realistic
military
strategy
to
deter
threats
to
peace
and
to
protect
freedom
if
deterrence
fails
our
armed
forces
are
finally
properly
paid
after
years
of
neglect
are
well
trained
and
becoming
better
equipped
and
supplied
and
the
american
uniform
is
once
again
worn
with
pride
most
of
the
major
systems
needed
for
modernizing
our
defenses
are
already
underway
and
we
will
be
addressing
one
key
system
the
mx
missile
in
consultation
with
the
congress
in
a
few
months
americas
foreign
policy
is
once
again
based
on
bipartisanship
on
realism
strength
full
partnership
in
consultation
with
our
allies
and
constructive
negotiation
with
potential
adversaries
from
the
middle
east
to
southern
africa
to
geneva
american
diplomats
are
taking
the
initiative
to
make
peace
and
lower
arms
levels
we
should
be
proud
of
our
role
as
peacemakers
in
the
middle
east
last
year
the
united
states
played
the
major
role
in
ending
the
tragic
fighting
in
lebanon
and
negotiated
the
withdrawal
of
the
plo
from
beirut
last
september
i
outlined
principles
to
carry
on
the
peace
process
begun
so
promisingly
at
camp
david
all
the
people
of
the
middle
east
should
know
that
in
the
year
ahead
we
will
not
flag
in
our
efforts
to
build
on
that
foundation
to
bring
them
the
blessings
of
peace
in
central
america
and
the
caribbean
basin
we
are
likewise
engaged
in
a
partnership
for
peace
prosperity
and
democracy
final
passage
of
the
remaining
portions
of
our
caribbean
basin
initiative
which
passed
the
house
last
year
is
one
of
this
administrations
top
legislative
priorities
for
the
security
and
economic
assistance
policies
of
this
administration
in
latin
america
and
elsewhere
are
based
on
realism
and
represent
a
critical
investment
in
the
future
of
the
human
race
this
undertaking
is
a
joint
responsibility
of
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
and
im
counting
on
the
cooperation
and
statesmanship
of
the
congress
to
help
us
meet
this
essential
foreign
policy
goal
at
the
heart
of
our
strategy
for
peace
is
our
relationship
with
the
soviet
union
the
past
year
saw
a
change
in
soviet
leadership
were
prepared
for
a
positive
change
in
sovietamerican
relations
but
the
soviet
union
must
show
by
deeds
as
well
as
words
a
sincere
commitment
to
respect
the
rights
and
sovereignty
of
the
family
of
nations
responsible
members
of
the
world
community
do
not
threaten
or
invade
their
neighbors
and
they
restrain
their
allies
from
aggression
for
our
part
were
vigorously
pursuing
arms
reduction
negotiations
with
the
soviet
union
supported
by
our
allies
weve
put
forward
draft
agreements
proposing
significant
weapon
reductions
to
equal
and
verifiable
lower
levels
we
insist
on
an
equal
balance
of
forces
and
given
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
soviet
violations
of
international
treaties
concerning
chemical
and
biological
weapons
we
also
insist
that
any
agreement
we
sign
can
and
will
be
verifiable
in
the
case
of
intermediaterange
nuclear
forces
we
have
proposed
the
complete
elimination
of
the
entire
class
of
landbased
missiles
were
also
prepared
to
carefully
explore
serious
soviet
proposals
at
the
same
time
let
me
emphasize
that
allied
steadfastness
remains
a
key
to
achieving
arms
reductions
with
firmness
and
dedication
well
continue
to
negotiate
deep
down
the
soviets
must
know
its
in
their
interest
as
well
as
ours
to
prevent
a
wasteful
arms
race
and
once
they
recognize
our
unshakable
resolve
to
maintain
adequate
deterrence
they
will
have
every
reason
to
join
us
in
the
search
for
greater
security
and
major
arms
reductions
when
that
moment
comesand
im
confident
that
it
willwe
will
have
taken
an
important
step
toward
a
more
peaceful
future
for
all
the
worlds
people
a
very
wise
man
bernard
baruch
once
said
that
america
has
never
forgotten
the
nobler
things
that
brought
her
into
being
and
that
light
her
path
our
country
is
a
special
place
because
we
americans
have
always
been
sustained
through
good
times
and
bad
by
a
noble
visiona
vision
not
only
of
what
the
world
around
us
is
today
but
what
we
as
a
free
people
can
make
it
be
tomorrow
were
realists
we
solve
our
problems
instead
of
ignoring
them
no
matter
how
loud
the
chorus
of
despair
around
us
but
were
also
idealists
for
it
was
an
ideal
that
brought
our
ancestors
to
these
shores
from
every
corner
of
the
world
right
now
we
need
both
realism
and
idealism
millions
of
our
neighbors
are
without
work
it
is
up
to
us
to
see
they
arent
without
hope
this
is
a
task
for
all
of
us
and
may
i
say
americans
have
rallied
to
this
cause
proving
once
again
that
we
are
the
most
generous
people
on
earth
we
who
are
in
government
must
take
the
lead
in
restoring
the
economy
and
here
all
that
time
i
thought
you
were
reading
the
paper
the
single
thingthe
single
thing
that
can
start
the
wheels
of
industry
turning
again
is
further
reduction
of
interest
rates
just
another
or
points
can
mean
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
right
now
with
inflation
as
low
as
it
is
percent
there
is
room
for
interest
rates
to
come
down
only
fear
prevents
their
reduction
a
lender
as
we
know
must
charge
an
interest
rate
that
recovers
the
depreciated
value
of
the
dollars
loaned
and
that
depreciation
is
of
course
the
amount
of
inflation
today
interest
rates
are
based
on
fearfear
that
government
will
resort
to
measures
as
it
has
in
the
past
that
will
send
inflation
zooming
again
we
who
serve
here
in
this
capital
must
erase
that
fear
by
making
it
absolutely
clear
that
we
will
not
stop
fighting
inflation
that
together
we
will
do
only
those
things
that
will
lead
to
lasting
economic
growth
yes
the
problems
confronting
us
are
large
and
forbidding
and
certainly
no
one
can
or
should
minimize
the
plight
of
millions
of
our
friends
and
neighbors
who
are
living
in
the
bleak
emptiness
of
unemployment
but
we
must
and
can
give
them
good
reason
to
be
hopeful
back
over
the
years
citizens
like
ourselves
have
gathered
within
these
walls
when
our
nation
was
threatened
sometimes
when
its
very
existence
was
at
stake
always
with

courage
and
common
sense
they
met
the
crises
of
their
time
and
lived
to
see
a
stronger
better
and
more
prosperous
country
the
present
situation
is
no
worse
and
in
fact
is
not
as
bad
as
some
of
those
they
faced
time
and
again
they
proved
that
there
is
nothing
we
americans
cannot
achieve
as
free
men
and
women
yes
we
still
have
problemsplenty
of
them
but
its
just
plain
wrongunjust
to
our
country
and
unjust
to
our
peopleto
let
those
problems
stand
in
the
way
of
the
most
important
truth
of
all
america
is
on
the
mend
we
owe
it
to
the
unfortunate
to
be
aware
of
their
plight
and
to
help
them
in
every
way
we
can
no
one
can
quarrel
with
that
we
must
and
do
have
compassion
for
all
the
victims
of
this
economic
crisis
but
the
big
story
about
america
today
is
the
way
that
millions
of
confident
caring
peoplethose
extraordinary
ordinary
americans
who
never
make
the
headlines
and
will
never
be
interviewedare
laying
the
foundation
not
just
for
recovery
from
our
present
problems
but
for
a
better
tomorrow
for
all
our
people
from
coast
to
coast
on
the
job
and
in
classrooms
and
laboratories
at
new
construction
sites
and
in
churches
and
community
groups
neighbors
are
helping
neighbors
and
theyve
already
begun
the
building
the
research
the
work
and
the
giving
that
will
make
our
country
great
again
i
believe
this
because
i
believe
in
themin
the
strength
of
their
hearts
and
minds
in
the
commitment
that
each
one
of
them
brings
to
their
daily
lives
be
they
high
or
humble
the
challenge
for
us
in
government
is
to
be
worthy
of
themto
make
government
a
help
not
a
hindrance
to
our
people
in
the
challenging
but
promising
days
ahead
if
we
do
that
if
we
care
what
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
will
say
of
us
if
we
want
them
one
day
to
be
thankful
for
what
we
did
here
in
these
temples
of
freedom
we
will
work
together
to
make
america
better
for
our
having
been
herenot
just
in
this
year
or
this
decade
but
in
the
next
century
and
beyond
thank
you
and
god
bless
you

the

spoke
at

in
the
house
chamber
of
the

he
was
introduced
by
thomas

oneill
jr

distinguished
members
of

honored
guests
and
fellow
citizens
today
marks
my
first
state
of
the
union
address
to
you
a
constitutional
duty
as
old
as
our
republic
itself
president
washington
began
this
tradition
in
after
reminding
the
nation
that
the
destiny
of
selfgovernment
and
the
preservation
of
the
sacred
fire
of
liberty
is
finally
staked
on
the
experiment
entrusted
to
the
hands
of
the
american
people
for
our
friends
in
the
press
who
place
a
high
premium
on
accuracy
let
me
say
i
did
not
actually
hear
george
washington
say
that
but
it
is
a
matter
of
historic
record
but
from
this
podium
winston
churchill
asked
the
free
world
to
stand
together
against
the
onslaught
of
aggression
franklin
delano
roosevelt
spoke
of
a
day
of
infamy
and
summoned
a
nation
to
arms
douglas
macarthur
made
an
unforgettable
farewell
to
a
country
he
loved
and
served
so
well
dwight
eisenhower
reminded
us
that
peace
was
purchased
only
at
the
price
of
strength
and
john
f
kennedy
spoke
of
the
burden
and
glory
that
is
freedom
when
i
visited
this
chamber
last
year
as
a
newcomer
to
washington
critical
of
past
policies
which
i
believed
had
failed
i
proposed
a
new
spirit
of
partnership
between
this
congress
and
this
administration
and
between
washington
and
our
state
and
local
governments
in
forging
this
new
partnership
for
america
we
could
achieve
the
oldest
hopes
of
our
republicprosperity
for
our
nation
peace
for
the
world
and
the
blessings
of
individual
liberty
for
our
children
and
someday
for
all
of
humanity
its
my
duty
to
report
to
you
tonight
on
the
progress
that
we
have
made
in
our
relations
with
other
nations
on
the
foundation
weve
carefully
laid
for
our
economic
recovery
and
finally
on
a
bold
and
spirited
initiative
that
i
believe
can
change
the
face
of
american
government
and
make
it
again
the
servant
of
the
people
seldom
have
the
stakes
been
higher
for
america
what
we
do
and
say
here
will
make
all
the
difference
to
autoworkers
in
detroit
lumberjacks
in
the
northwest
steelworkers
in
steubenville
who
are
in
the
unemployment
lines
to
black
teenagers
in
newark
and
chicago
to
hardpressed
farmers
and
small
businessmen
and
to
millions
of
everyday
americans
who
harbor
the
simple
wish
of
a
safe
and
financially
secure
future
for
their
children
to
understand
the
state
of
the
union
we
must
look
not
only
at
where
we
are
and
where
were
going
but
where
weve
been
the
situation
at
this
time
last
year
was
truly
ominous
the
last
decade
has
seen
a
series
of
recessions
there
was
a
recession
in
in
and
again
in
the
spring
of
each
time
unemployment
increased
and
inflation
soon
turned
up
again
we
coined
the
word
stagflation
to
describe
this
governments
response
to
these
recessions
was
to
pump
up
the
money
supply
and
increase
spending
in
the
last
months
of
as
an
example
the
money
supply
increased
at
the
fastest
rate
in
postwar
history
percent
inflation
remained
in
double
digits
and
government
spending
increased
at
an
annual
rate
of
percent
interest
rates
reached
a
staggering
percent
there
were
million
unemployed
late
in
we
sank
into
the
present
recession
largely
because
continued
high
interest
rates
hurt
the
auto
industry
and
construction
and
there
was
a
drop
in
productivity
and
the
already
high
unemployment
increased
this
time
however
things
are
different
we
have
an
economic
program
in
place
completely
different
from
the
artificial
quick
fixes
of
the
past
it
calls
for
a
reduction
of
the
rate
of
increase
in
government
spending
and
already
that
rate
has
been
cut
nearly
in
half
but
reduced
spending
the
first
and
smallest
phase
of
a
year
tax
rate
reduction
designed
to
stimulate
the
economy
and
create
jobs
already
interest
rates
are
down
to
percent
but
they
must
still
go
lower
inflation
is
down
from
percent
to
and
for
the
month
of
december
it
was
running
at
an
annualized
rate
of
percent
if
we
had
not
acted
as
we
did
things
would
be
far
worse
for
all
americans
than
they
are
today
inflation
taxes
and
interest
rates
would
all
be
higher
a
year
ago
americans
faith
in
their
governmental
process
was
steadily
declining
six
out
of
americans
were
saying
they
were
pessimistic
about
their
future
a
new
kind
of
defeatism
was
heard
some
said
our
domestic
problems
were
uncontrollable
that
we
had
to
learn
to
live
with
this
seemingly
endless
cycle
of
high
inflation
and
high
unemployment
there
were
also
pessimistic
predictions
about
the
relationship
between
our
administration
and
this
congress
it
was
said
we
could
never
work
together
well
those
predictions
were
wrong
the
record
is
clear
and
i
believe
that
history
will
remember
this
as
an
era
of
american
renewal
remember
this
administration
as
an
administration
of
change
and
remember
this
congress
as
a
congress
of
destiny
together
we
not
only
cut
the
increase
in
government
spending
nearly
in
half
we
brought
about
the
largest
tax
reductions
and
the
most
sweeping
changes
in
our
tax
structure
since
the
beginning
of
this
century
and
because
we
indexed
future
taxes
to
the
rate
of
inflation
we
took
away
governments
builtin
profit
on
inflation
and
its
hidden
incentive
to
grow
larger
at
the
expense
of
american
workers
together
after
years
of
taking
power
away
from
the
hands
of
the
people
in
their
states
and
local
communities
we
have
started
returning
power
and
resources
to
them
together
we
have
cut
the
growth
of
new
federal
regulations
nearly
in
half
in
there
were
fewer
pages
in
the
federal
register
which
lists
new
regulations
than
there
were
in
by
deregulating
oil
weve
come
closer
to
achieving
energy
independence
and
helped
bring
down
the
cost
of
gasoline
and
heating
fuel
together
we
have
created
an
effective
federal
strike
force
to
combat
waste
and
fraud
in
government
in
just
months
it
has
saved
the
taxpayers
more
than
billion
and
its
only
getting
started
together
weve
begun
to
mobilize
the
private
sector
not
to
duplicate
wasteful
and
discredited
government
programs
but
to
bring
thousands
of
americans
into
a
volunteer
effort
to
help
solve
many
of
americas
social
problems
together
weve
begun
to
restore
that
margin
of
military
safety
that
ensures
peace
our
countrys
uniform
is
being
worn
once
again
with
pride
together
we
have
made
a
new
beginning
but
we
have
only
begun
no
one
pretends
that
the
way
ahead
will
be
easy
in
my
inaugural
address
last
year
i
warned
that
the
ills
we
suffer
have
come
upon
us
over
several
decades
they
will
not
go
away
in
days
weeks
or
months
but
they
will
go
away
because
we
as
americans
have
the
capacity
now
as
weve
had
it
in
the
past
to
do
whatever
needs
to
be
done
to
preserve
this
last
and
greatest
bastion
of
freedom
the
economy
will
face
difficult
moments
in
the
months
ahead
but
the
program
for
economic
recovery
that
is
in
place
will
pull
the
economy
out
of
its
slump
and
put
us
on
the
road
to
prosperity
and
stable
growth
by
the
latter
half
of
this
year
and
that
is
why
i
can
report
to
you
tonight
that
in
the
near
future
the
state
of
the
union
and
the
economy
will
be
bettermuch
betterif
we
summon
the
strength
to
continue
on
the
course
that
weve
charted
and
so
the
question
if
the
fundamentals
are
in
place
what
now
well
two
things
first
we
must
understand
whats
happening
at
the
moment
to
the
economy
our
current
problems
are
not
the
product
of
the
recovery
program
thats
only
just
now
getting
underway
as
some
would
have
you
believe
they
are
the
inheritance
of
decades
of
tax
and
tax
and
spend
and
spend
second
because
our
economic
problems
are
deeply
rooted
and
will
not
respond
to
quick
political
fixes
we
must
stick
to
our
carefully
integrated
plan
for
recovery
that
plan
is
based
on
four
commonsense
fundamentals
continued
reduction
of
the
growth
in
federal
spending
preserving
the
individual
and
business
tax
reductions
that
will
stimulate
saving
and
investment
removing
unnecessary
federal
regulations
to
spark
productivity
and
maintaining
a
healthy
dollar
and
a
stable
monetary
policy
the
latter
a
responsibility
of
the
federal
reserve
system
the
only
alternative
being
offered
to
this
economic
program
is
a
return
to
the
policies
that
gave
us
a
trilliondollar
debt
runaway
inflation
runaway
interest
rates
and
unemployment
the
doubters
would
have
us
turn
back
the
clock
with
tax
increases
that
would
offset
the
personal
tax
rate
reductions
already
passed
by
this
congress
raise
present
taxes
to
cut
future
deficits
they
tell
us
well
i
dont
believe
we
should
buy
that
argument
there
are
too
many
imponderables
for
anyone
to
predict
deficits
or
surpluses
several
years
ahead
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
the
budget
in
place
when
i
took
office
had
been
projected
as
balanced
it
turned
out
to
have
one
of
the
biggest
deficits
in
history
another
example
of
the
imponderables
that
can
make
deficit
projections
highly
questionablea
change
of
only
one
percentage
point
in
unemployment
can
alter
a
deficit
up
or
down
by
some
billion
as
it
now
stands
our
forecast
which
were
required
by
law
to
make
will
show
major
deficits
starting
at
less
than
a
hundred
billion
dollars
and
declining
but
still
too
high
more
important
were
making
progress
with
the
three
keys
to
reducing
deficits
economic
growth
lower
interest
rates
and
spending
control
the
policies
we
have
in
place
will
reduce
the
deficit
steadily
surely
and
in
time
completely
higher
taxes
would
not
mean
lower
deficits
if
they
did
how
would
we
explain
that
tax
revenues
more
than
doubled
just
since
yet
in
that
same
year
period
we
ran
the
largest
series
of
deficits
in
our
history
in
tax
revenues
increased
by
billion
and
in
we
had
one
of
our
alltime
biggest
deficits
raising
taxes
wont
balance
the
budget
it
will
encourage
more
government
spending
and
less
private
investment
raising
taxes
will
slow
economic
growth
reduce
production
and
destroy
future
jobs
making
it
more
difficult
for
those
without
jobs
to
find
them
and
more
likely
that
those
who
now
have
jobs
could
lose
them
so
i
will
not
ask
you
to
try
to
balance
the
budget
on
the
backs
of
the
american
taxpayers
i
will
seek
no
tax
increases
this
year
and
i
have
no
intention
of
retreating
from
our
basic
program
of
tax
relief

i
promise
to
bring
the
american
peopleto
bring
their
tax
rates
down
and
to
keep
them
down
to
provide
them
incentives
to
rebuild
our
economy
to
save
to
invest
in
americas
future
i
will
stand
by
my
word
tonight
im
urging
the
american
people
seize
these
new
opportunities
to
produce
to
save
to
invest
and
together
well
make
this
economy
a
mighty
engine
of
freedom
hope
and
prosperity
again
now
the
budget
deficit
this
year
will
exceed
our
earlier
expectations
the
recession
did
that
it
lowered
revenues
and
increased
costs
to
some
extent
were
also
victims
of
our
own
success
weve
brought
inflation
down
faster
than
we
thought
we
could
and
in
doing
this
weve
deprived
government
of
those
hidden
revenues
that
occur
when
inflation
pushes
people
into
higher
income
tax
brackets
and
the
continued
high
interest
rates
last
year
cost
the
government
about
billion
more
than
anticipated
we
must
cut
out
more
nonessential
government
spending
and
rout
out
more
waste
and
we
will
continue
our
efforts
to
reduce
the
number
of
employees
in
the
federal
work
force
by
the
budget
plan
i
submit
to
you
on
february
th
will
realize
major
savings
by
dismantling
the
departments
of
energy
and
education
and
by
eliminating
ineffective
subsidies
for
business
well
continue
to
redirect
our
resources
to
our
two
highest
budget
prioritiesa
strong
national
defense
to
keep
america
free
and
at
peace
and
a
reliable
safety
net
of
social
programs
for
those
who
have
contributed
and
those
who
are
in
need
contrary
to
some
of
the
wild
charges
you
may
have
heard
this
administration
has
not
and
will
not
turn
its
back
on
americas
elderly
or
americas
poor
under
the
new
budget
funding
for
social
insurance
programs
will
be
more
than
double
the
amount
spent
only
years
ago
but
it
would
be
foolish
to
pretend
that
these
or
any
programs
cannot
be
made
more
efficient
and
economical
the
entitlement
programs
that
make
up
our
safety
net
for
the
truly
needy
have
worthy
goals
and
many
deserving
recipients
we
will
protect
them
but
theres
only
one
way
to
see
to
it
that
these
programs
really
help
those
whom
they
were
designed
to
help
and
that
is
to
bring
their
spiraling
costs
under
control
today
we
face
the
absurd
situation
of
a
federal
budget
with
threequarters
of
its
expenditures
routinely
referred
to
as
uncontrollable
and
a
large
part
of
this
goes
to
entitlement
programs
committee
after
committee
of
this
congress
has
heard
witness
after
witness
describe
many
of
these
programs
as
poorly
administered
and
rife
with
waste
and
fraud
virtually
every
american
who
shops
in
a
local
supermarket
is
aware
of
the
daily
abuses
that
take
place
in
the
food
stamp
program
which
has
grown
by
percent
in
the
last
years
another
example
is
medicare
and
medicaidprograms
with
worthy
goals
but
whose
costs
have
increased
from
billion
to
almost
billion
more
than
times
as
much
in
just
years
waste
and
fraud
are
serious
problems
back
in
federal
investigators
testified
before
one
of
your
committees
that
corruption
has
permeated
virtually
every
area
of
the
medicare
and
medicaid
health
care
industry
one
official
said
many
of
the
people
who
are
cheating
the
system
were
very
confident
that
nothing
was
going
to
happen
to
them
well
something
is
going
to
happen
not
only
the
taxpayers
are
defrauded
the
people
with
real
dependency
on
these
programs
are
deprived
of
what
they
need
because
available
resources
are
going
not
to
the
needy
but
to
the
greedy
the
time
has
come
to
control
the
uncontrollable
in
august
we
made
a
start
i
signed
a
bill
to
reduce
the
growth
of
these
programs
by
billion
over
the
next
years
while
at
the
same
time
preserving
essential
services
for
the
truly
needy
shortly
you
will
receive
from
me
a
message
on
further
reforms
we
intend
to
installsome
new
but
others
long
recommended
by
your
own
congressional
committees
i
ask
you
to
help
make
these
savings
for
the
american
taxpayer
the
savings
we
propose
in
entitlement
programs
will
total
some
billion
over
years
and
will
without
affecting
social
t
security
go
a
long
way
toward
bringing
federal
spending
under
control
but
dont
be
fooled
by
those
who
proclaim
that
spending
cuts
will
deprive
the
elderly
the
needy
and
the
helpless
the
federal
government
will
still
subsidize
million
meals
every
day
thats
one
out
of
seven
of
all
the
meals
served
in
america
head
start
senior
nutrition
programs
and
child
welfare
programs
will
not
be
cut
from
the
levels
we
proposed
last
year
more
than
onehalf
billion
dollars
has
been
proposed
for
minority
business
assistance
and
research
at
the
national
institute
of
health
will
be
increased
by
over
million
while
meeting
all
these
needs
we
intend
to
plug
unwarranted
tax
loopholes
and
strengthen
the
law
which
requires
all
large
corporations
to
pay
a
minimum
tax
i
am
confident
the
economic
program
weve
put
into
operation
will
protect
the
needy
while
it
triggers
a
recovery
that
will
benefit
all
americans
it
will
stimulate
the
economy
result
in
increased
savings
and
provide
capital
for
expansion
mortgages
for
homebuilding
and
jobs
for
the
unemployed
now
that
the
essentials
of
that
program
are
in
place
our
next
major
undertaking
must
be
a
programjust
as
bold
just
as
innovativeto
make
government
again
accountable
to
the
people
to
make
our
system
of
federalism
work
again
our
citizens
feel
theyve
lost
control
of
even
the
most
basic
decisions
made
about
the
essential
services
of
government
such
as
schools
welfare
roads
and
even
garbage
collection
and
theyre
right
a
maze
of
interlocking
jurisdictions
and
levels
of
government
confronts
average
citizens
in
trying
to
solve
even
the
simplest
of
problems
they
dont
know
where
to
turn
for
answers
who
to
hold
accountable
who
to
praise
who
to
blame
who
to
vote
for
or
against
the
main
reason
for
this
is
the
overpowering
growth
of
federal
grantsinaid
programs
during
the
past
few
decades
in
the
federal
government
had
categorical
grant
programs
costing
billion
when
i
took
office
there
were
approximately
costing
nearly
a
hundred
billion
dollars
programs
for
energy
for
pollution
control
for
social
services
for
education
and
here
in
the
congress
it
takes
at
least
committees
just
to
try
to
keep
track
of
them
you
know
and
i
know
that
neither
the
president
nor
the
congress
can
properly
oversee
this
jungle
of
grantsinaid
indeed
the
growth
of
these
grants
has
led
to
the
distortion
in
the
vital
functions
of
government
as
one
democratic
governor
put
it
recently
the
national
government
should
be
worrying
about
arms
control
not
potholes
the
growth
in
these
federal
programs
hasin
the
words
of
one
intergovernmental
commissionmade
the
federal
government
more
pervasive
more
intrusive
more
unmanageable
more
ineffective
and
costly
and
above
all
more
un
accountable
lets
solve
this
problem
with
a
single
bold
stroke
the
return
of
some
billion
in
federal
programs
to
state
and
local
government
together
with
the
means
to
finance
them
and
a
transition
period
of
nearly
years
to
avoid
unnecessary
disruption
i
will
shortly
send
this
congress
a
message
describing
this
program
i
want
to
emphasize
however
that
its
full
details
will
have
been
worked
out
only
after
close
consultation
with
congressional
state
and
local
officials
starting
in
fiscal
the
federal
government
will
assume
full
responsibility
for
the
cost
of
the
rapidly
growing
medicaid
program
to
go
along
with
its
existing
responsibility
for
medicare
as
part
of
a
financially
equal
swap
the
states
will
simultaneously
take
full
responsibility
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
and
food
stamps
this
will
make
welfare
less
costly
and
more
responsive
to
genuine
need
because
itll
be
designed
and
administered
closer
to
the
grass
roots
and
the
people
it
serves
in
the
federal
government
will
apply
the
full
proceeds
from
certain
excise
taxes
to
a
grass
roots
trust
fund
that
will
belong
in
fair
shares
to
the
states
the
total
amount
flowing
into
this
fund
will
be
billion
a
year
over
the
next
years
the
states
can
use
this
money
in
either
of
two
ways
if
they
want
to
continue
receiving
federal
grants
in
such
areas
as
transportation
education
and
social
services
they
can
use
their
trust
fund
money
to
pay
for
the
grants
or
to
the
extent
they
choose
to
forgo
the
federal
grant
programs
they
can
use
their
trust
fund
money
on
their
own
for
those
or
other
purposes
there
will
be
a
mandatory
passthrough
of
part
of
these
funds
to
local
governments
by
the
states
will
be
in
complete
control
of
over
federal
grant
programs
the
trust
fund
will
start
to
phase
out
eventually
to
disappear
and
the
excise
taxes
will
be
turned
over
to
the
states
they
can
then
preserve
lower
or
raise
taxes
on
their
own
and
fund
and
manage
these
programs
as
they
see
fit
in
a
single
stroke
we
will
be
accomplishing
a
realignment
that
will
end
cumbersome
administration
and
spiraling
costs
at
the
federal
level
while
we
ensure
these
programs
will
be
more
responsive
to
both
the
people
theyre
meant
to
help
and
the
people
who
pay
for
them
hand
in
hand
with
this
program
to
strengthen
the
discretion
and
flexibility
of
state
and
local
governments
were
proposing
legislation
for
an
experimental
effort
to
improve
and
develop
our
depressed
urban
areas
in
the
s
and
s
this
legislation
will
permit
states
and
localities
to
apply
to
the
federal
government
for
designation
as
urban
enterprise
zones
a
broad
range
of
special
economic
incentives
in
the
zones
will
help
attract
new
business
new
jobs
new
opportunity
to
americas
inner
cities
and
rural
towns
some
will
say
our
mission
is
to
save
free
enterprise
well
i
say
we
must
free
enterprise
so
that
together
we
can
save
america
some
will
also
say
our
states
and
local
communities
are
not
up
to
the
challenge
of
a
new
and
creative
partnership
well
that
might
have
been
true
years
ago
before
reforms
like
reapportionment
and
the
voting
rights
act
the
year
extension
of
which
i
strongly
support
its
no
longer
true
today
this
administration
has
faith
in
state
and
local
governments
and
the
constitutional
balance
envisioned
by
the
founding
fathers
we
also
believe
in
the
integrity
decency
and
sound
good
sense
of
grass
roo
ts
americans
our
faith
in
the
american
people
is
reflected
in
another
major
endeavor
our
private
sector
initiatives
task
force
is
seeking
out
successful
community
models
of
school
church
business
union
foundation
and
civic
programs
that
help
community
needs
such
groups
are
almost
invariably
far
more
efficient
than
government
in
running
social
programs
were
not
asking
them
to
replace
discarded
and
often
discredited
government
programs
dollar
for
dollar
service
for
service
we
just
want
to
help
them
perform
the
good
works
they
choose
and
help
others
to
profit
by
their
example
three
hundred
and
eightyfive
thousand
corporations
and
private
organizations
are
already
working
on
social
programs
ranging
from
drug
rehabilitation
to
job
training
and
thousands
more
americans
have
written
us
asking
how
they
can
help
the
volunteer
spirit
is
still
alive
and
well
in
america
our
nations
long
journey
towards
civil
rights
for
all
our
citizensonce
a
source
of
discord
now
a
source
of
pridemust
continue
with
no
backsliding
or
slowing
down
we
must
and
shall
see
that
those
basic
laws
that
guarantee
equal
rights
are
preserved
and
when
necessary
strengthened
our
concern
for
equal
rights
for
women
is
firm
and
unshakable
we
launched
a
new
task
force
on
legal
equity
for
women
and
a
fifty
states
project
that
will
examine
state
laws
for
discriminatory
language
and
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
a
woman
sits
on
the
highest
court
in
the
land
so
too
the
problem
of
crimeone
as
real
and
deadly
serious
as
any
in
america
today
it
demands
that
we
seek
transformation
of
our
legal
system
which
overly
protects
the
rights
of
criminals
while
it
leaves
society
and
the
innocent
victims
of
crime
without
justice
we
look
forward
to
the
enactment
of
a
responsible
clean
air
act
to
increase
jobs
while
continuing
to
improve
the
quality
of
our
air
were
encouraged
by
the
bipartisan
initiative
of
the
house
and
are
hopeful
of
further
progress
as
the
senate
continues
its
deliberations
so
far
ive
concentrated
largely
now
on
domestic
matters
to
view
the
state
of
the
union
in
perspective
we
must
not
ignore
the
rest
of
the
world
there
isnt
time
tonight
for
a
lengthy
treatment
of
socialor
foreign
policy
i
should
say
a
subject
i
intend
to
address
in
detail
in
the
near
future
a
few
words
however
are
in
order
on
the
progress
weve
made
over
the
past
year
reestablishing
respect
for
our
nation
around
the
globe
and
some
of
the
challenges
and
goals
that
we
will
approach
in
the
year
ahead
at
ottawa
and
cancun
i
met
with
leaders
of
the
major
industrial
powers
and
developing
nations
now
some
of
those
i
met
with
were
a
little
surprised
that
i
didnt
apologize
for
americas
wealth
instead
i
spoke
of
the
strength
of
the
free
marketplace
system
and
how
that
system
could
help
them
realize
their
aspirations
for
economic
development
and
political
freedom
i
believe
lasting
friendships
were
made
and
the
foundation
was
laid
for
future
cooperation
in
the
vital
region
of
the
caribbean
basin
were
developing
a
program
of
aid
trade
and
investment
incentives
to
promote
selfsustaining
growth
and
a
better
more
secure
life
for
our
neighbors
to
the
south
toward
those
who
would
export
terrorism
and
subversion
in
the
caribbean
and
elsewhere
especially
cuba
and
libya
we
will
act
with
firmness
our
foreign
policy
is
a
policy
of
strength
fairness
and
balance
by
restoring
americas
military
credibility
by
pursuing
peace
at
the
negotiating
table
wherever
both
sides
are
willing
to
sit
down
in
good
faith
and
by
regaining
the
respect
of
americas
allies
and
adversaries
alike
we
have
strengthened
our
countrys
position
as
a
force
for
peace
and
progress
in
the
world
when
action
is
called
for
were
taking
it
our
sanctions
against
the
military
dictatorship
that
has
attempted
to
crush
human
rights
in
polandand
against
the
soviet
regime
behind
that
military
dictatorshipclearly
demonstrated
to
the
world
that
america
will
not
conduct
business
as
usual
with
the
forces
of
oppression
if
the
events
in
poland
continue
to
deteriorate
further
measures
will
follow
now
let
me
also
note
that
private
american
groups
have
taken
the
lead
in
making
january
th
a
day
of
solidarity
with
the
people
of
poland
so
too
the
european
parliament
has
called
for
march
st
to
be
an
international
day
of
support
for
afghanistan
well
i
urge
all
peaceloving
peoples
to
join
together
on
those
days
to
raise
their
voices
to
speak
and
pray
for
freedom
meanwhile
were
working
for
reduction
of
arms
and
military
activities
as
i
announced
in
my
address
to
the
nation
last
november
th
we
have
proposed
to
the
soviet
union
a
farreaching
agenda
for
mutual
reduction
of
military
forces
and
have
already
initiated
negotiations
with
them
in
geneva
on
intermediaterange
nuclear
forces
in
those
talks
it
is
essential
that
we
negotiate
from
a
position
of
strength
there
must
be
a
real
incentive
for
the
soviets
to
take
these
talks
seriously
this
requires
that
we
rebuild
our
defenses
in
the
last
decade
while
we
sought
the
moderation
of
soviet
power
through
a
process
of
restraint
and
accommodation
the
soviets
engaged
in
an
unrelenting
buildup
of
their
military
forces
the
protection
of
our
national
security
has
required
that
we
undertake
a
substantial
program
to
enhance
our
military
forces
we
have
not
neglected
to
strengthen
our
traditional
alliances
in
europe
and
asia
or
to
develop
key
relationships
with
our
partners
in
the
middle
east
and
other
countries
building
a
more
peaceful
world
requires
a
sound
strategy
and
the
national
resolve
to
back
it
up
when
radical
forces
threaten
our
friends
when
economic
misfortune
creates
conditions
of
instability
when
strategically
vital
parts
of
the
world
fall
under
the
shadow
of
soviet
power
our
response
can
make
the
difference
between
peaceful
change
or
disorder
and
violence
thats
why
weve
laid
such
stress
not
only
on
our
own
defense
but
on
our
vital
foreign
assistance
program
your
recent
passage
of
the
foreign
assistance
act
sent
a
signal
to
the
world
that
america
will
not
shrink
from
making
the
investments
necessary
for
both
peace
and
security
our
foreign
policy
must
be
rooted
in
realism
not
naivete
or
selfdelusion
a
recognition
of
what
the
soviet
empire
is
about
is
the
starting
point
winston
churchill
in
negotiating
with
the
soviets
observed
that
they
respect
only
strength
and
resolve
in
their
dealings
with
other
nations
thats
why
weve
moved
to
reconstruct
our
national
defenses
we
intend
to
keep
the
peace
we
will
also
keep
our
freedom
we
have
made
pledges
of
a
new
frankness
in
our
public
statements
and
worldwide
broadcasts
in
the
face
of
a
climate
of
falsehood
and
misinformation
weve
promised
the
world
a
season
of
truththe
truth
of
our
great
civilized
ideas
individual
liberty
representative
government
the
rule
of
law
under
god
weve
never
needed
walls
or
minefields
or
barbed
wire
to
keep
our
people
in
nor
do
we
declare
martial
law
to
keep
our
people
from
voting
for
the
kind
of
government
they
want
yes
we
have
our
problems
yes
were
in
a
time
of
recession
and
its
true
theres
no
quick
fix
as
i
said
to
instantly
end
the
tragic
pain
of
unemployment
but
we
will
end
it
the
process
has
already
begun
and
well
see
its
effect
as
the
year
goes
on
we
speak
with
pride
and
admiration
of
that
little
band
of
americans
who
overcame
insuperable
odds
to
set
this
nation
on
course
years
ago
but
our
glory
didnt
end
with
them
americans
ever
since
have
emulated
their
deeds
we
dont
have
to
turn
to
our
history
books
for
heroes
theyre
all
around
us
one
who
sits
among
you
here
tonight
epitomized
that
heroism
at
the
end
of
the
longest
imprisonment
ever
inflicted
on
men
of
our
armed
forces
who
will
ever
forget
that
night
when
we
waited
for
television
to
bring
us
the
scene
of
that
first
plane
landing
at
clark
field
in
the
philippines
bringing
our
pows
home
the
plane
door
opened
and
jeremiah
denton
came
slowly
down
the
ramp
he
caught
sight
of
our
flag
saluted
it
said
god
bless
america
and
then
thanked
us
for
bringing
him
home
just
weeks
ago
in
the
midst
of
a
terrible
tragedy
on
the
potomac
we
saw
again
the
spirit
of
american
heroism
at
its
finestthe
heroism
of
dedicated
rescue
workers
saving
crash
victims
from
icy
waters
and
we
saw
the
heroism
of
one
of
our
young
government
employees
lenny
skutnik
who
when
he
saw
a
woman
lose
her
grip
on
the
helicopter
line
dived
into
the
water
and
dragged
her
to
safety
and
then
there
are
countless
quiet
everyday
heroes
of
american
who
sacrifice
long
and
hard
so
their
children
will
know
a
better
life
than
theyve
known
church
and
civic
volunteers
who
help
to
feed
clothe
nurse
and
teach
the

i
come
before
you
once
again
to
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
this
report
will
be
my
lastmaybelaughterbut
for
the
union
it
is
only
the
first
of
such
reports
in
our
third
century
of
independence
the
close
of
which
none
of
us
will
ever
see
we
can
be
confident
however
that
years
from
now
a
freely
elected
president
will
come
before
a
freely
elected
congress
chosen
to
renew
our
great
republics
pledge
to
the
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
for
my
part
i
pray
the
third
century
we
are
beginning
will
bring
to
all
americans
our
children
and
their
childrens
children
a
greater
measure
of
individual
equality
opportunity
and
justice
a
greater
abundance
of
spiritual
and
material
blessings
and
a
higher
quality
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
the
state
of
the
union
is
a
measurement
of
the
many
elements
of
which
it
is
composeda
political
union
of
diverse
states
an
economic
union
of
varying
interests
an
intellectual
union
of
common
convictions
and
a
moral
union
of
immutable
ideals
taken
in
sum
i
can
report
that
the
state
of
the
union
is
good
there
is
room
for
improvement
as
always
but
today
we
have
a
more
perfect
union
than
when
my
stewardship
began
as
a
people
we
discovered
that
our
bicentennial
was
much
more
than
a
celebration
of
the
past
it
became
a
joyous
reaffirmation
of
all
that
it
means
to
be
americans
a
confirmation
before
all
the
world
of
the
vitality
and
durability
of
our
free
institutions
i
am
proud
to
have
been
privileged
to
preside
over
the
affairs
of
our
federal
government
during
these
eventful
years
when
we
proved
as
i
said
in
my
first
words
upon
assuming
office
that
our
constitution
works
our
great
republic
is
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
here
the
people
rule
the
people
have
spoken
they
have
chosen
a
new
president
and
a
new
congress
to
work
their
will
i
congratulate
youparticularly
the
new
membersas
sincerely
as
i
did
presidentelect
carter
in
a
few
days
it
will
be
his
duty
to
outline
for
you
his
priorities
and
legislative
recommendations
tonight
i
will
not
infringe
on
that
responsibility
but
rather
wish
him
the
very
best
in
all
that
is
good
for
our
country
during
the
period
of
my
own
service
in
this
capitol
and
in
the
white
house
i
can
recall
many
orderly
transitions
of
governmental
responsibilityof
problems
as
well
as
of
position
of
burdens
as
well
as
of
power
the
genius
of
the
american
system
is
that
we
do
this
so
naturally
and
so
normally
there
are
no
soldiers
marching
in
the
street
except
in
the
inaugural
parade
no
public
demonstrations
except
for
some
of
the
dancers
at
the
inaugural
ball
the
opposition
party
doesnt
go
underground
but
goes
on
functioning
vigorously
in
the
congress
and
in
the
country
and
our
vigilant
press
goes
right
on
probing
and
publishing
our
faults
and
our
follies
confirming
the
wisdom
of
the
framers
of
the
first
amendment
because
of
the
transfer
of
authority
in
our
form
of
government
affects
the
state
of
the
union
and
of
the
world
i
am
happy
to
report
to
you
that
the
current
transition
is
proceeding
very
well
i
was
determined
that
it
should
i
wanted
the
new
president
to
get
off
on
an
easier
start
than
i
had
when
i
became
president
on
august
our
nation
was
deeply
divided
and
tormented
in
rapid
succession
the
vice
president
and
the
president
had
resigned
in
disgrace
we
were
still
struggling
with
the
aftereffects
of
a
long
unpopular
and
bloody
war
in
southeast
asia
the
economy
was
unstable
and
racing
toward
the
worst
recession
in
years
people
were
losing
jobs
the
cost
of
living
was
soaring
the
congress
and
the
chief
executive
were
at
loggerheads
the
integrity
of
our
constitutional
process
and
other
institutions
was
being
questioned
for
more
than
years
domestic
spending
had
soared
as
federal
programs
multiplied
and
the
expense
escalated
annually
during
the
same
period
our
national
security
needs
were
steadily
shortchanged
in
the
grave
situation
which
prevailed
in
august
our
will
to
maintain
our
international
leadership
was
in
doubt
i
asked
for
your
prayers
and
went
to
work
in
january
i
reported
to
the
congress
that
the
state
of
the
union
was
not
good
i
proposed
urgent
action
to
improve
the
economy
and
to
achieve
energy
independence
in
years
i
reassured
americas
allies
and
sought
to
reduce
the
danger
of
confrontation
with
potential
adversaries
i
pledged
a
new
direction
for
america
was
a
year
of
difficult
decisions
but
americans
responded
with
realism
common
sense
and
selfdiscipline
by
january
we
were
headed
in
a
new
direction
which
i
hold
to
be
the
right
direction
for
a
free
society
it
was
guided
by
the
belief
that
successful
problemsolving
requires
more
than
federal
action
alone
that
it
involves
a
full
partnership
among
all
branches
and
all
levels
of
government
and
public
policies
which
nurture
and
promote
the
creative
energies
of
private
enterprises
institutions
and
individual
citizens
a
year
ago
i
reported
that
the
state
of
the
union
was
betterin
many
ways
a
lot
betterbut
still
not
good
enough
common
sense
told
me
to
stick
to
the
steady
course
we
were
on
to
continue
to
restrain
the
inflationary
growth
of
government
to
reduce
taxes
as
well
as
spending
to
return
local
decisions
to
local
officials
to
provide
for
longrange
sufficiency
in
energy
and
national
security
needs
i
resisted
the
immense
pressures
of
an
election
year
to
open
the
floodgates
of
federal
money
and
the
temptation
to
promise
more
than
i
could
deliver
i
told
it
as
it
was
to
the
american
people
and
demonstrated
to
the
world
that
in
our
spirited
political
competition
as
in
this
chamber
americans
can
disagree
without
being
disagreeable
now
after
months
as
your
president
i
can
say
that
while
we
still
have
a
way
to
go
i
am
proud
of
the
long
way
we
have
come
together
i
am
proud
of
the
part
i
have
had
in
rebuilding
confidence
in
the
presidency
confidence
in
our
free
system
and
confidence
in
our
future
once
again
americans
believe
in
themselves
in
their
leaders
and
in
the
promise
that
tomorrow
holds
for
their
children
i
am
proud
that
today
america
is
at
peace
none
of
our
sons
are
fighting
and
dying
in
battle
anywhere
in
the
world
and
the
chance
for
peace
among
all
nations
is
improved
by
our
determination
to
honor
our
vital
commitments
in
defense
of
peace
and
freedom
i
am
proud
that
the
united
states
has
strong
defenses
strong
alliances
and
a
sound
and
courageous
foreign
policy
our
alliances
with
major
partners
the
great
industrial
democracies
of
western
europe
japan
and
canada
have
never
been
more
solid
consultations
on
mutual
security
defense
and
eastwest
relations
have
grown
closer
collaboration
has
branched
out
into
new
fields
such
as
energy
economic
policy
and
relations
with
the
third
world
we
have
used
many
avenues
for
cooperation
including
summit
meetings
held
among
major
allied
countries
the
friendship
of
the
democracies
is
deeper
warmer
and
more
effective
than
at
any
time
in
years
we
are
maintaining
stability
in
the
strategic
nuclear
balance
and
pushing
back
the
specter
of
nuclear
war
a
decisive
step
forward
was
taken
in
the
vladivostok
accord
which
i
negotiated
with
general
secretary
brezhnevjoint
recognition
that
an
equal
ceiling
should
be
placed
on
the
number
of
strategic
weapons
on
each
side
with
resolve
and
wisdom
on
the
part
of
both
nations
a
good
agreement
is
well
within
reach
this
year
the
framework
for
peace
in
the
middle
east
has
been
built
hopes
for
future
progress
in
the
middle
east
were
stirred
by
the
historic
agreements
we
reached
and
the
trust
and
confidence
that
we
formed
thanks
to
american
leadership
the
prospects
for
peace
in
the
middle
east
are
brighter
than
they
have
been
in
three
decades
the
arab
states
and
israel
continue
to
look
to
us
to
lead
them
from
confrontation
and
war
to
a
new
era
of
accommodation
and
peace
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
persevere
and
i
am
sure
we
will
the
opportunities
for
a
final
settlement
are
great
and
the
price
of
failure
is
a
return
to
the
bloodshed
and
hatred
that
for
too
long
have
brought
tragedy
to
all
of
the
peoples
of
this
area
and
repeatedly
edged
the
world
to
the
brink
of
war
our
relationship
with
the
peoples
republic
of
china
is
proving
its
importance
and
its
durability
we
are
finding
more
and
more
common
ground
between
our
two
countries
on
basic
questions
of
international
affairs
in
my
two
trips
to
asia
as
president
we
have
reaffirmed
americas
continuing
vital
interest
in
the
peace
and
security
of
asia
and
the
pacific
basin
established
a
new
partnership
with
japan
confirmed
our
dedication
to
the
security
of
korea
and
reinforced
our
ties
with
the
free
nations
of
southeast
asia
an
historic
dialog
has
begun
between
industrial
nations
and
developing
nations
most
proposals
on
the
table
are
the
initiatives
of
the
united
states
including
those
on
food
energy
technology
trade
investment
and
commodities
we
are
well
launched
on
this
process
of
shaping
positive
and
reliable
economic
relations
between
rich
nations
and
poor
nations
over
the
long
term
we
have
made
progress
in
trade
negotiations
and
avoided
protectionism
during
recession
we
strengthened
the
international
monetary
system
during
the
past
years
the
free
worlds
most
important
economic
powers
have
already
brought
about
important
changes
that
serve
both
developed
and
developing
economies
the
momentum
already
achieved
must
be
nurtured
and
strengthened
for
the
prosperity
of
the
rich
and
poor
depends
upon
it
in
latin
america
our
relations
have
taken
on
a
new
maturity
and
a
sense
of
common
enterprise
in
africa
the
quest
for
peace
racial
justice
and
economic
progress
is
at
a
crucial
point
the
united
states
in
close
cooperation
with
the
united
kingdom
is
actively
engaged
in
this
historic
process
will
change
come
about
by
warfare
and
chaos
and
foreign
intervention
or
will
it
come
about
by
negotiated
and
fair
solutions
ensuring
majority
rule
minority
rights
and
economic
advance
america
is
committed
to
the
side
of
peace
and
justice
and
to
the
principle
that
africa
s
hould
shape
its
own
future
free
of
outside
intervention
american
leadership
has
helped
to
stimulate
new
international
efforts
to
stem
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons
and
to
shape
a
comprehensive
treaty
governing
the
use
of
oceans
i
am
gratified
by
these
accomplishments
they
constitute
a
record
of
broad
success
for
america
and
for
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
all
mankind
this
administration
leaves
to
its
successor
a
world
in
better
condition
than
we
found
we
leave
as
well
a
solid
foundation
for
progress
on
a
range
of
issues
that
are
vital
to
the
wellbeing
of
america
what
has
been
achieved
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs
and
what
can
be
accomplished
by
the
new
administration
demonstrate
the
genius
of
americans
working
together
for
the
common
good
it
is
this
our
remarkable
ability
to
work
together
that
has
made
us
a
unique
nation
it
is
congress
the
president
and
the
people
striving
for
a
better
world
i
know
all
patriotic
americans
want
this
nations
foreign
policy
to
succeed
i
urge
members
of
my
party
in
this
congress
to
give
the
new
president
loyal
support
in
this
area
i
express
the
hope
that
this
new
congress
will
reexamine
its
constitutional
role
in
international
affairs
the
exclusive
right
to
declare
war
the
duty
to
advise
and
consent
on
the
part
of
the
senate
the
power
of
the
purse
on
the
part
of
the
house
are
ample
authority
for
the
legislative
branch
and
should
be
jealously
guarded
but
because
we
may
have
been
too
careless
of
these
powers
in
the
past
does
not
justify
congressional
intrusion
into
or
obstruction
of
the
proper
exercise
of
presidential
responsibilities
now
or
in
the
future
there
can
be
only
one
commander
in
chief
in
these
times
crises
cannot
be
managed
and
wars
cannot
be
waged
by
committee
nor
can
peace
be
pursued
solely
by
parliamentary
debate
to
the
ears
of
the
world
the
president
speaks
for
the
nation
while
he
is
of
course
ultimately
accountable
to
the
congress
the
courts
and
the
people
he
and
his
emissaries
must
not
be
handicapped
in
advance
in
their
relations
with
foreign
governments
as
has
sometimes
happened
in
the
past
at
home
i
am
encouraged
by
the
nations
recovery
from
the
recession
and
our
steady
return
to
sound
economic
growth
it
is
now
continuing
after
the
recent
period
of
uncertainty
which
is
part
of
the
price
we
pay
for
free
elections
our
most
pressing
need
today
and
the
future
is
more
jobsproductive
permanent
jobs
created
by
a
thriving
economy
we
must
revise
our
tax
system
both
to
ease
the
burden
of
heavy
taxation
and
to
encourage
the
investment
necessary
for
the
creation
of
productive
jobs
for
all
americans
who
want
to
work
earlier
this
month
i
proposed
a
permanent
income
tax
reduction
of
billion
below
current
levels
including
raising
the
personal
exemption
from
to
i
also
recommended
a
series
of
measures
to
stimulate
investment
such
as
accelerated
depreciation
for
new
plants
and
equipment
in
areas
of
high
unemployment
a
reduction
in
the
corporate
tax
rate
from
to
percent
and
eliminating
the
present
double
taxation
of
dividends
i
strongly
urge
the
congress
to
pass
these
measures
to
help
create
the
productive
permanent
jobs
in
the
private
economy
that
are
so
essential
for
our
future
all
the
basic
trends
are
good
we
are
not
on
the
brink
of
another
recession
or
economic
disaster
if
we
follow
prudent
policies
that
encourage
productive
investment
and
discourage
destructive
inflation
we
will
come
out
on
top
and
i
am
sure
we
will
we
have
successfully
cut
inflation
by
more
than
half
when
i
took
office
the
consumer
price
index
was
rising
at
percent
a
year
during
the
rate
of
inflation
was
percent
we
have
created
more
jobsover
million
more
jobs
today
than
in
the
spring
of
throughout
this
nation
today
we
have
over
million
people
in
useful
productive
jobsmore
than
at
any
other
time
in
our
nations
history
but
there
are
still
too
many
americans
unemployed
this
is
the
greatest
regret
that
i
have
as
i
leave
office
we
brought
about
with
the
congress
after
much
delay
the
renewal
of
the
general
revenue
sharing
we
expanded
community
development
and
federal
manpower
programs
we
began
a
significant
urban
mass
transit
program
federal
programs
today
provide
more
funds
for
our
states
and
local
governments
than
ever
before
billion
for
the
current
fiscal
year
through
these
programs
and
others
that
provide
aid
directly
to
individuals
we
have
kept
faith
with
our
tradition
of
compassionate
help
for
those
who
need
it
as
we
begin
our
third
century
we
can
be
proud
of
the
progress
that
we
have
made
in
meeting
human
needs
for
all
of
our
citizens
we
have
cut
the
growth
of
crime
by
nearly
percent
two
years
ago
crime
was
increasing
at
the
rate
of
percent
annually
in
the
first
three
quarters
of
that
growth
rate
had
been
cut
to
percent
but
crime
and
the
fear
of
crime
remains
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
facing
our
citizens
we
have
had
some
successes
and
there
have
been
some
disappointments
bluntly
i
must
remind
you
that
we
have
not
made
satisfactory
progress
toward
achieving
energy
independence
energy
is
absolutely
vital
to
the
defense
of
our
country
to
the
strength
of
our
economy
and
to
the
quality
of
our
lives
two
years
ago
i
proposed
to
the
congress
the
first
comprehensive
national
energy
programa
specific
and
coordinated
set
of
measures
that
would
end
our
vulnerability
to
embargo
blockade
or
arbitrary
price
increases
and
would
mobilize
us
technology
and
resources
to
supply
a
significant
share
of
the
free
worlds
energy
after
of
the
major
energy
proposals
i
submitted
years
ago
only
half
belatedly
became
law
in
we
were
dependent
upon
foreign
oil
imports
for
percent
of
our
needs
today
we
are
percent
dependent
and
well
pay
out
billion
for
foreign
oil
this
year
such
vulnerability
at
present
or
in
the
future
is
intolerable
and
must
be
ended
the
answer
to
where
we
stand
on
our
national
energy
effort
today
reminds
me
of
the
old
argument
about
whether
the
tank
is
half
full
or
half
empty
the
pessimist
will
say
we
have
half
failed
to
achieve
our
year
energy
goals
the
optimist
will
say
that
we
have
half
succeeded
i
am
always
an
optimist
but
we
must
make
up
for
lost
time
we
have
laid
a
solid
foundation
for
completing
the
enormous
task
which
confronts
us
i
have
signed
into
law
five
major
energy
bills
which
contain
significant
measures
for
conservation
resource
development
stockpiling
and
standby
authorities
we
have
moved
forward
to
develop
the
naval
petroleum
reserves
to
build
a
million
barrel
strategic
petroleum
stockpile
to
phase
out
unnecessary
government
allocation
and
price
controls
to
develop
a
lasting
relationship
with
other
oil
consuming
nations
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
energy
use
through
conservation
in
automobiles
buildings
and
industry
and
to
expand
research
on
new
technology
and
renewable
resources
such
as
wind
power
geothermal
and
solar
energy
all
these
actions
significant
as
they
are
for
the
long
term
are
only
the
beginning
i
recently
submitted
to
the
congress
my
proposals
to
reorganize
the
federal
energy
structure
and
the
hard
choices
which
remain
if
we
are
serious
about
reducing
our
dependence
upon
foreign
energy
these
include
programs
to
reverse
our
declining
production
of
natural
gas
and
increase
incentives
for
domestic
crude
oil
production
i
proposed
to
minimize
environmental
uncertainties
affecting
coal
development
expand
nuclear
power
generation
and
create
an
energy
independence
authority
to
provide
government
financial
assistance
for
vital
energy
programs
where
private
capital
is
not
available
we
must
explore
every
reasonable
prospect
for
meeting
our
energy
needs
when
our
current
domestic
reserves
of
oil
and
natural
gas
begin
to
dwindle
in
the
next
decade
i
urgently
ask
congress
and
the
new
administration
to
move
quickly
on
these
issues
this
nation
has
the
resources
and
the
capability
to
achieve
our
energy
goals
if
its
government
has
the
will
to
proceed
and
i
think
we
do
i
have
been
disappointed
by
inability
to
complete
many
of
the
meaningful
organizational
reforms
which
i
contemplated
for
the
federal
government
although
a
start
has
been
made
for
example
the
federal
judicial
system
has
long
served
as
a
model
for
other
courts
but
today
it
is
threatened
by
a
shortage
of
qualified
federal
judges
and
an
explosion
of
litigation
claiming
federal
jurisdiction
i
commend
to
the
new
administration
and
the
congress
the
recent
report
and
recommendations
of
the
department
of
justice
undertaken
at
my
request
on
the
needs
of
the
federal
courts
i
especially
endorse
its
proposals
for
a
new
commission
on
the
judicial
appointment
process
while
the
judicial
branch
of
our
government
may
require
reinforcement
the
budgets
and
payrolls
of
the
other
branches
remain
staggering
i
cannot
help
but
observe
that
while
the
white
house
staff
and
the
executive
office
of
the
president
have
been
reduced
and
the
total
number
of
civilians
in
the
executive
branch
contained
during
the
s
the
legislative
branch
has
increased
substantially
although
the
membership
of
the
congress
remains
at
congress
now
costs
the
taxpayers
more
than
a
million
dollars
per
member
the
whole
legislative
budget
has
passed
the
billion
dollar
mark
we
have
made
some
progress
in
cutting
back
the
expansion
of
government
and
its
intrusion
into
individual
lives
but
believe
me
there
is
much
more
to
be
doneand
you
and
i
know
it
it
can
only
be
done
by
tough
and
temporarily
painful
surgery
by
a
congress
as
prepared
as
the
president
to
face
up
to
this
very
real
political
problem
again
i
wish
my
successor
working
with
a
substantial
majority
of
his
own
party
the
best
of
success
in
reforming
the
costly
and
cumbersome
machinery
of
the
federal
government
the
task
of
selfgovernment
is
never
finished
the
problems
are
great
the
opportunities
are
greater
americas
first
goal
is
and
always
will
be
peace
with
honor
america
must
remain
first
in
keeping
peace
in
the
world
we
can
remain
first
in
peace
only
if
we
are
never
second
in
defense
in
presenting
the
state
of
the
union
to
the
congress
and
to
the
american
people
i
have
a
special
obligation
as
commander
in
chief
to
report
on
our
na
tional
defense
our
survival
as
a
free
and
independent
people
requires
above
all
strong
military
forces
that
are
well
equipped
and
highly
trained
to
perform
their
assigned
mission
i
am
particularly
gratified
to
report
that
over
the
past
years
we
have
been
able
to
reverse
the
dangerous
decline
of
the
previous
decade
in
real
resources
this
country
was
devoting
to
national
defense
this
was
an
immediate
problem
i
faced
in
the
evidence
was
unmistakable
that
the
soviet
union
had
been
steadily
increasing
the
resources
it
applied
to
building
its
military
strength
during
this
same
period
the
united
states
real
defense
spending
declined
in
my
three
budgets
we
not
only
arrested
that
dangerous
decline
but
we
have
established
the
positive
trend
which
is
essential
to
our
ability
to
contribute
to
peace
and
stability
in
the
world
the
vietnam
war
both
materially
and
psychologically
affected
our
overall
defense
posture
the
dangerous
antimilitary
sentiment
discouraged
defense
spending
and
unfairly
disparaged
the
men
and
women
who
serve
in
our
armed
forces
the
challenge
that
now
confronts
this
country
is
whether
we
have
the
national
will
and
determination
to
continue
this
essential
defense
effort
over
the
long
term
as
it
must
be
continued
we
can
no
longer
afford
to
oscillate
from
year
to
year
in
so
vital
a
matter
indeed
we
have
a
duty
to
look
beyond
the
immediate
question
of
budgets
and
to
examine
the
nature
of
the
problem
we
will
face
over
the
next
generation
i
am
the
first
recent
president
able
to
address
longterm
basic
issues
without
the
burden
of
vietnam
the
war
in
indochina
consumed
enormous
resources
at
the
very
time
that
the
overwhelming
strategic
superiority
we
once
enjoyed
was
disappearing
in
past
years
as
a
result
of
decisions
by
the
united
states
our
strategic
forces
leveled
off
yet
the
soviet
union
continued
a
steady
constant
buildup
of
its
own
forces
committing
a
high
percentage
of
its
national
economic
effort
to
defense
the
united
states
can
never
tolerate
a
shift
in
strategic
balance
against
us
or
even
a
situation
where
the
american
people
or
our
allies
believe
the
balance
is
shifting
against
us
the
united
states
would
risk
the
most
serious
political
consequences
if
the
world
came
to
believe
that
our
adversaries
have
a
decisive
margin
of
superiority
to
maintain
a
strategic
balance
we
must
look
ahead
to
the
s
and
beyond
the
sophistication
of
modern
weapons
requires
that
we
make
decisions
now
if
we
are
to
ensure
our
security
years
from
now
therefore
i
have
consistently
advocated
and
strongly
urged
that
we
pursue
three
critical
strategic
programs
the
trident
missile
launching
submarine
the
b
bomber
with
its
superior
capability
to
penetrate
modern
air
defenses
and
a
more
advanced
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
that
will
be
better
able
to
survive
nuclear
attack
and
deliver
a
devastating
retaliatory
strike
in
an
era
where
the
strategic
nuclear
forces
are
in
rough
equilibrium
the
risks
of
conflict
below
the
nuclear
threshold
may
grow
more
perilous
a
major
longterm
objective
therefore
is
to
maintain
capabilities
to
deal
with
and
thereby
deter
conventional
challenges
and
crises
particularly
in
europe
we
cannot
rely
solely
on
strategic
forces
to
guarantee
our
security
or
to
deter
all
types
of
aggression
we
must
have
superior
naval
and
marine
forces
to
maintain
freedom
of
the
seas
strong
multipurpose
tactical
air
forces
and
mobile
modern
ground
forces
accordingly
i
have
directed
a
longterm
effort
to
improve
our
worldwide
capabilities
to
deal
with
regional
crises
i
have
submitted
a
year
naval
building
program
indispensable
to
the
nations
maritime
strategy
because
the
security
of
europe
and
the
integrity
of
nato
remain
the
cornerstone
of
american
defense
policy
i
have
initiated
a
special
longterm
program
to
ensure
the
capacity
of
the
alliance
to
deter
or
defeat
aggression
in
europe
as
i
leave
office
i
can
report
that
our
national
defense
is
effectively
deterring
conflict
today
our
armed
forces
are
capable
of
carrying
out
the
variety
of
missions
assigned
to
them
programs
are
underway
which
will
assure
we
can
deter
war
in
the
years
ahead
but
i
also
must
warn
that
it
will
require
a
sustained
effort
over
a
period
of
years
to
maintain
these
capabilities
we
must
have
the
wisdom
the
stamina
and
the
courage
to
prepare
today
for
the
perils
of
tomorrow
and
i
believe
we
will
as
i
look
to
the
futureand
i
assure
you
i
intend
to
go
on
doing
that
for
a
good
many
yearsi
can
say
with
confidence
that
the
state
of
the
union
is
good
but
we
must
go
on
making
it
better
and
better
this
gathering
symbolizes
the
constitutional
foundation
which
makes
continued
progress
possible
synchronizing
the
skills
of
three
independent
branches
of
government
reserving
fundamental
sovereignty
to
the
people
of
this
great
land
it
is
only
as
the
temporary
representatives
and
servants
of
the
people
that
we
meet
here
we
bring
no
hereditary
status
or
gift
of
infallibility
and
none
follows
us
from
this
place
like
president
washington
like
the
more
fortunate
of
his
successors
i
look
forward
to
the
status
of
private
citizen
with
gladness
and
gratitude
to
me
being
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
the
greatest
honor
and
privilege
in
this
world
from
the
opportunities
which
fate
and
my
fellow
citizens
have
given
me
as
a
member
of
the
house
as
vice
president
and
president
of
the
senate
and
as
president
of
all
the
people
i
have
come
to
understand
and
place
the
highest
value
on
the
checks
and
balances
which
our
founders
imposed
on
government
through
the
separation
of
powers
among
coequal
legislative
executive
and
judicial
branches
this
often
results
in
difficulty
and
delay
as
i
well
know
but
it
also
places
supreme
authority
under
god
beyond
any
one
person
any
one
branch
any
majority
great
or
small
or
any
one
party
the
constitution
is
the
bedrock
of
all
our
freedoms
guard
and
cherish
it
keep
honor
and
order
in
your
own
house
and
the
republic
will
endure
it
is
not
easy
to
end
these
remarks
in
this
chamber
along
with
some
of
you
i
have
experienced
many
many
of
the
highlights
of
my
life
it
was
here

i
stood
years

always

friends
that

later

mr
speaker
mr
vice

members
of
the
th
congress
and
distinguished
guests
as
we
begin
our
bicentennial
america
is
still
one
of
the
youngest
nations
in
recorded
history
long
before
our
forefathers
came
to
these
shores
men
and
women
had
been
struggling
on
this
planet
to
forge
a
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families
in
mans
long
upward
march
from
savagery
and
slaverythroughout
the
nearly
years
of
the
christian
calendar
the
nearly
years
of
jewish
reckoningthere
have
been
many
deep
terrifying
valleys
but
also
many
bright
and
towering
peaks
one
peak
stands
highest
in
the
ranges
of
human
history
one
example
shines
forth
of
a
people
uniting
to
produce
abundance
and
to
share
the
good
life
fairly
and
with
freedom
one
union
holds
out
the
promise
of
justice
and
opportunity
for
every
citizen
that
union
is
the
united
states
of
america
we
have
not
remade
paradise
on
earth
we
know
perfection
will
not
be
found
here
but
think
for
a
minute
how
far
we
have
come
in
years
we
came
from
many
roots
and
we
have
many
branches
yet
all
americans
across
the
eight
generations
that
separate
us
from
the
stirring
deeds
of
those
who
know
no
other
homeland
and
those
who
just
found
refuge
among
our
shores
say
in
unison
i
am
proud
of
america
and
i
am
proud
to
be
an
american
life
will
be
a
little
better
here
for
my
children
than
for
me
i
believe
this
not
because
i
am
told
to
believe
it
but
because
life
has
been
better
for
me
than
it
was
for
my
father
and
my
mother
i
know
it
will
be
better
for
my
children
because
my
hands
my
brains
my
voice
and
my
vote
can
help
make
it
happen
it
has
happened
here
in
america
it
has
happened
to
you
and
to
me
government
exists
to
create
and
preserve
conditions
in
which
people
can
translate
their
ideas
into
practical
reality
in
the
best
of
times
much
is
lost
in
translation
but
we
try
sometimes
we
have
tried
and
failed
always
we
have
had
the
best
of
intentions
but
in
the
recent
past
we
sometimes
forgot
the
sound
principles
that
guided
us
through
most
of
our
history
we
wanted
to
accomplish
great
things
and
solve
ageold
problems
and
we
became
overconfident
of
our
abilities
we
tried
to
be
a
policeman
abroad
and
the
indulgent
parent
here
at
home
we
thought
we
could
transform
the
country
through
massive
national
programs
but
often
the
programs
did
not
work
too
often
they
only
made
things
worse
in
our
rush
to
accomplish
great
deeds
quickly
we
trampled
on
sound
principles
of
restraint
and
endangered
the
rights
of
individuals
we
unbalanced
our
economic
system
by
the
huge
and
unprecedented
growth
of
federal
expenditures
and
borrowing
and
we
were
not
totally
honest
with
ourselves
about
how
much
these
programs
would
cost
and
how
we
would
pay
for
them
finally
we
shifted
our
emphasis
from
defense
to
domestic
problems
while
our
adversaries
continued
a
massive
buildup
of
arms
the
time
has
now
come
for
a
fundamentally
different
approach
for
a
new
realism
that
is
true
to
the
great
principles
upon
which
this
nation
was
founded
we
must
introduce
a
new
balance
to
our
economya
balance
that
favors
not
only
sound
active
government
but
also
a
much
more
vigorous
healthy
economy
that
can
create
new
jobs
and
hold
down
prices
we
must
introduce
a
new
balance
in
the
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
governmenta
balance
that
favors
greater
individual
freedom
and
selfreliance
we
must
strike
a
new
balance
in
our
system
of
federalisma
balance
that
favors
greater
responsibility
and
freedom
for
the
leaders
of
our
state
and
local
governments
we
must
introduce
a
new
balance
between
the
spending
on
domestic
programs
and
spending
on
defensea
balance
that
ensures
we
will
fully
meet
our
obligation
to
the
needy
while
also
protecting
our
security
in
a
world
that
is
still
hostile
to
freedom
and
in
all
that
we
do
we
must
be
more
honest
with
the
american
people
promising
them
no
more
than
we
can
deliver
and
delivering
all
that
we
promise
the
genius
of
america
has
been
its
incredible
ability
to
improve
the
lives
of
its
citizens
through
a
unique
combination
of
governmental
and
free
citizen
activity
history
and
experience
tells
us
that
moral
progress
cannot
come
in
comfortable
and
in
complacent
times
but
out
of
trial
and
out
of
confusion
tom
paine
aroused
the
troubled
americans
of
to
stand
up
to
the
times
that
try
mens
souls
because
the
harder
the
conflict
the
more
glorious
the
triumph
just
a
year
ago
i
reported
that
the
state
of
the
union
was
not
good
tonight
i
report
that
the
state
of
our
union
is
betterin
many
ways
a
lot
betterbut
still
not
good
enough
to
paraphrase
tom
paine
was
not
a
year
for
summer
soldiers
and
sunshine
patriots
it
was
a
year
of
fears
and
alarms
and
of
dire
forecastsmost
of
which
never
happened
and
wont
happen
as
you
recall
the
year
opened
with
rancor
and
with
bitterness
political
misdeeds
of
the
past
had
neither
been
forgotten
nor
forgiven
the
longest
most
divisive
war
in
our
history
was
winding
toward
an
unhappy
conclusion
many
feared
that
the
end
of
that
foreign
war
of
men
and
machines
meant
the
beginning
of
a
domestic
war
of
recrimination
and
reprisal
friends
and
adversaries
abroad
were
asking
whether
america
had
lost
its
nerve
finally
our
economy
was
ravaged
by
inflationinflation
that
was
plunging
us
into
the
worst
recession
in
four
decades
at
the
same
time
americans
became
increasingly
alienated
from
big
institutions
they
were
steadily
losing
confidence
not
just
in
big
government
but
in
big
business
big
labor
and
big
education
among
others
ours
was
a
troubled
land
and
so
was
a
year
of
hard
decisions
difficult
compromises
and
a
new
realism
that
taught
us
something
important
about
america
it
brought
back
a
needed
measure
of
common
sense
steadfastness
and
selfdiscipline
americans
did
not
panic
or
demand
instant
but
useless
cures
in
all
sectors
people
met
their
difficult
problems
with
the
restraint
and
with
responsibility
worthy
of
their
great
heritage
add
up
the
separate
pieces
of
progress
in
subtract
the
setbacks
and
the
sum
total
shows
that
we
are
not
only
headed
in
a
new
direction
a
direction
which
i
proposed
months
ago
but
it
turned
out
to
be
the
right
direction
it
is
the
right
direction
because
it
follows
the
truly
revolutionary
american
concept
of
which
holds
that
in
a
free
society
the
making
of
public
policy
and
successful
problemsolving
involves
much
more
than
government
it
involves
a
full
partnership
among
all
branches
and
all
levels
of
government
private
institutions
and
individual
citizens
common
sense
tells
me
to
stick
to
that
steady
course
take
the
state
of
our
economy
last
january
most
things
were
rapidly
getting
worse
this
january
most
things
are
slowly
but
surely
getting
better
the
worst
recession
since
world
war
ii
turned
around
in
april
the
best
costofliving
news
of
the
past
year
is
that
doubledigit
inflation
of
percent
or
higher
was
cut
almost
in
half
the
worstunemployment
remains
far
too
high
today
nearly
more
americans
are
working
than
at
the
bottom
of
the
recession
at
years
end
people
were
again
being
hired
much
faster
than
they
were
being
laid
off
yet
lets
be
honest
many
americans
have
not
yet
felt
these
changes
in
their
daily
lives
they
still
see
prices
going
up
far
too
fast
and
they
still
know
the
fear
of
unemployment
we
are
also
a
growing
nation
we
need
more
and
more
jobs
every
year
todays
economy
has
produced
over
million
jobs
for
americans
but
we
need
a
lot
more
jobs
especially
for
the
young
my
first
objective
is
to
have
sound
economic
growth
without
inflation
we
all
know
from
recent
experience
what
runaway
inflation
does
to
ruin
every
other
worthy
purpose
we
are
slowing
it
we
must
stop
it
cold
for
many
americans
the
way
to
a
healthy
noninflationary
economy
has
become
increasingly
apparent
the
government
must
stop
spending
so
much
and
stop
borrowing
so
much
of
our
money
more
money
must
remain
in
private
hands
where
it
will
do
the
most
good
to
hold
down
the
cost
of
living
we
must
hold
down
the
cost
of
government
in
the
past
decade
the
federal
budget
has
been
growing
at
an
average
rate
of
over
percent
a
year
the
budget
i
am
submitting
wednesday
cuts
this
rate
of
growth
in
half
i
have
kept
my
promise
to
submit
a
budget
for
the
next
fiscal
year
of
billion
in
fact
it
is
billion
by
holding
down
the
growth
of
federal
spending
we
can
afford
additional
tax
cuts
and
return
to
the
people
who
pay
taxes
more
decisionmaking
power
over
their
own
lives
last
month
i
signed
legislation
to
extend
the
tax
reductions
for
the
first
months
of
this
year
i
now
propose
that
effective
july
we
give
our
taxpayers
a
tax
cut
of
approximately
billion
more
than
congress
agreed
to
in
december
my
broader
tax
reduction
would
mean
that
for
a
family
of
four
making
a
year
there
will
be
more
in
takehome
pay
annually
hardworking
americans
caught
in
the
middle
can
really
use
that
kind
of
extra
cash
my
recommendations
for
a
firm
restraint
on
the
growth
of
federal
spending
and
for
greater
tax
reduction
are
simple
and
straightforward
for
every
dollar
saved
in
cutting
the
growth
in
the
federal
budget
we
can
have
an
added
dollar
of
federal
tax
reduction
we
can
achieve
a
balanced
budget
by
if
we
have
the
courage
and
the
wisdom
to
continue
to
reduce
the
growth
of
federal
spending
one
test
of
a
healthy
economy
is
a
job
for
every
american
who
wants
to
work
governmentour
kind
of
governmentcannot
create
that
many
jobs
but
the
federal
government
can
create
conditions
and
incentives
for
private
business
and
industry
to
make
more
and
more
jobs
five
out
of
six
jobs
in
this
country
are
in
private
business
and
in
industry
common
sense
tells
us
this
is
the
place
to
look
for
more
jobs
and
to
find
them
faster
i
mean
real
rewarding
permanent
jobs
to
achieve
this
we
must
offer
the
american
people
greater
incentives
to
invest
in
the
future
my
tax
proposals
are
a
major
step
in
that
direction
to
supplement
these
proposals
i
ask
that
congress
enact
changes
in
federal
tax
laws
that
will
speed
up
plant
expansion
and
the
purchase
of
new
equipment
my
recommendations
will
concentrate
this
jobcreation
tax
incentive
in
areas
where
the
unemployment
rate
now
runs
ov
er
percent
legislation
to
get
this
started
must
be
approved
at
the
earliest
possible
date
within
the
strict
budget
total
that
i
will
recommend
for
the
coming
year
i
will
ask
for
additional
housing
assistance
for
families
these
programs
will
expand
housing
opportunities
spur
construction
and
help
to
house
moderate
and
lowincome
families
we
had
a
disappointing
year
in
the
housing
industry
in
but
with
lower
interest
rates
and
available
mortgage
money
we
can
have
a
healthy
recovery
in
a
necessary
condition
of
a
healthy
economy
is
freedom
from
the
petty
tyranny
of
massive
government
regulation
we
are
wasting
literally
millions
of
working
hours
costing
billions
of
taxpayers
and
consumers
dollars
because
of
bureaucratic
redtape
the
american
farmer
who
now
feeds
million
americans
but
also
millions
worldwide
has
shown
how
much
more
he
can
produce
without
the
shackles
of
government
control
now
we
badly
need
reforms
in
other
key
areas
in
our
economy
the
airlines
trucking
railroads
and
financial
institutions
i
have
submitted
concrete
plans
in
each
of
these
areas
not
to
help
this
or
that
industry
but
to
foster
competition
and
to
bring
prices
down
for
the
consumer
this
administration
in
addition
will
strictly
enforce
the
federal
antitrust
laws
for
the
very
same
purposes
taking
a
longer
look
at
americas
future
there
can
be
neither
sustained
growth
nor
more
jobs
unless
we
continue
to
have
an
assured
supply
of
energy
to
run
our
economy
domestic
production
of
oil
and
gas
is
still
declining
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
at
high
prices
is
still
too
great
draining
jobs
and
dollars
away
from
our
own
economy
at
the
rate
of
per
year
for
every
american
last
month
i
signed
a
compromise
national
energy
bill
which
enacts
a
part
of
my
comprehensive
energy
independence
program
this
legislation
was
late
not
the
complete
answer
to
energy
independence
but
still
a
start
in
the
right
direction
i
again
urge
the
congress
to
move
ahead
immediately
on
the
remainder
of
my
energy
proposals
to
make
america
invulnerable
to
the
foreign
oil
cartel
my
proposals
as
all
of
you
know
would
reduce
domestic
natural
gas
shortages
allow
production
from
federal
petroleum
reserves
stimulate
effective
conservation
including
revitalization
of
our
railroads
and
the
expansion
of
our
urban
transportation
systems
develop
more
and
cleaner
energy
from
our
vast
coal
resources
expedite
clean
and
safe
nuclear
power
production
create
a
new
national
energy
independence
authority
to
stimulate
vital
energy
investment
and
accelerate
development
of
technology
to
capture
energy
from
the
sun
and
the
earth
for
this
and
future
generations
also
i
ask
for
the
sake
of
future
generations
that
we
preserve
the
family
farm
and
familyowned
small
business
both
strengthen
america
and
give
stability
to
our
economy
i
will
propose
estate
tax
changes
so
that
family
businesses
and
family
farms
can
be
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
without
having
to
be
sold
to
pay
taxes
i
propose
tax
changes
to
encourage
people
to
invest
in
americas
future
and
their
own
through
a
plan
that
gives
moderateincome
families
income
tax
benefits
if
they
make
longterm
investments
in
common
stock
in
american
companies
the
federal
government
must
and
will
respond
to
clearcut
national
needsfor
this
and
future
generations
hospital
and
medical
services
in
america
are
among
the
best
in
the
world
but
the
cost
of
a
serious
and
extended
illness
can
quickly
wipe
out
a
familys
lifetime
savings
increasing
health
costs
are
of
deep
concern
to
all
and
a
powerful
force
pushing
up
the
cost
of
living
the
burden
of
catastrophic
illness
can
be
borne
by
very
few
in
our
society
we
must
eliminate
this
fear
from
every
family
i
propose
catastrophic
health
insurance
for
everybody
covered
by
medicare
to
finance
this
added
protection
fees
for
shortterm
care
will
go
up
somewhat
but
nobody
after
reaching
age
will
have
to
pay
more
than
a
year
for
covered
hospital
or
nursing
home
care
nor
more
than
for
years
doctor
bills
we
cannot
realistically
afford
federally
dictated
national
health
insurance
providing
full
coverage
for
all
million
americans
the
experience
of
other
countries
raises
questions
about
the
quality
as
well
as
the
cost
of
such
plans
but
i
do
envision
the
day
when
we
may
use
the
private
health
insurance
system
to
offer
more
middleincome
families
high
quality
health
services
at
prices
they
can
afford
and
shield
them
also
from
their
catastrophic
illnesses
using
resources
now
available
i
propose
improving
the
medicare
and
other
federal
health
programs
to
help
those
who
really
need
protectionolder
people
and
the
poor
to
help
states
and
local
governments
give
better
health
care
to
the
poor
i
propose
that
we
combine
existing
federal
programs
including
medicaid
into
a
single
billion
federal
grant
funds
would
be
divided
among
states
under
a
new
formula
which
provides
a
larger
share
of
federal
money
to
those
states
that
have
a
larger
share
of
lowincome
families
i
will
take
further
steps
to
improve
the
quality
of
medical
and
hospital
care
for
those
who
have
served
in
our
armed
forces
now
let
me
speak
about
social
security
our
federal
social
security
system
for
people
who
have
worked
and
contributed
to
it
for
all
their
lives
is
a
vital
part
of
our
economic
system
its
value
is
no
longer
debatable
in
my
budget
for
fiscal
year
i
am
recommending
that
the
full
costofliving
increases
in
the
social
security
benefits
be
paid
during
the
coming
year
but
i
am
concerned
about
the
integrity
of
our
social
security
trust
fund
that
enables
peoplethose
retired
and
those
still
working
who
will
retireto
count
on
this
source
of
retirement
income
younger
workers
watch
their
deductions
rise
and
wonder
if
they
will
be
adequately
protected
in
the
future
we
must
meet
this
challenge
head
on
simple
arithmetic
warns
all
of
us
that
the
social
security
trust
fund
is
headed
for
trouble
unless
we
act
soon
to
make
sure
the
fund
takes
in
as
much
as
it
pays
out
there
will
be
no
security
for
old
or
for
young
i
must
therefore
recommend
a
threetenths
of
percent
increase
in
both
employer
and
employee
social
security
taxes
effective
january
this
will
cost
each
covered
employee
less
than
extra
dollar
a
week
and
will
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
trust
fund
as
we
rebuild
our
economy
we
have
a
continuing
responsibility
to
provide
a
temporary
cushion
to
the
unemployed
at
my
request
the
congress
enacted
two
extensions
and
two
expansions
in
unemployment
insurance
which
helped
those
who
were
jobless
during
these
programs
will
continue
in
in
my
fiscal
year
budget
i
am
also
requesting
funds
to
continue
proven
job
training
and
employment
opportunity
programs
for
millions
of
other
americans
compassion
and
a
sense
of
communitytwo
of
americas
greatest
strengths
throughout
our
historytell
us
we
must
take
care
of
our
neighbors
who
cannot
take
care
of
themselves
the
host
of
federal
programs
in
this
field
reflect
our
generosity
as
a
people
but
everyone
realizes
that
when
it
comes
to
welfare
government
at
all
levels
is
not
doing
the
job
well
too
many
of
our
welfare
programs
are
inequitable
and
invite
abuse
too
many
of
our
welfare
programs
have
problems
from
beginning
to
end
worse
we
are
wasting
badly
needed
resources
without
reaching
many
of
the
truly
needy
complex
welfare
programs
cannot
be
reformed
overnight
surely
we
cannot
simply
dump
welfare
into
the
laps
of
the
states
their
local
taxpayers
or
their
private
charities
and
just
walk
away
from
it
nor
is
it
the
right
time
for
massive
and
sweeping
changes
while
we
are
still
recovering
from
the
recession
nevertheless
there
are
still
plenty
of
improvements
that
we
can
make
i
will
ask
congress
for
presidential
authority
to
tighten
up
the
rules
for
eligibility
and
benefits
last
year
i
twice
sought
long
overdue
reform
of
the
scandalriddled
food
stamp
program
this
year
i
say
again
lets
give
food
stamps
to
those
most
in
need
lets
not
give
any
to
those
who
dont
need
them
protecting
the
life
and
property
of
the
citizen
at
home
is
the
responsibility
of
all
public
officials
but
is
primarily
the
job
of
local
and
state
law
enforcement
authorities
americans
have
always
found
the
very
thought
of
a
federal
police
force
repugnant
and
so
do
i
but
there
are
proper
ways
in
which
we
can
help
to
insure
domestic
tranquility
as
the
constitution
charges
us
my
recommendations
on
how
to
control
violent
crime
were
submitted
to
the
congress
last
june
with
strong
emphasis
on
protecting
the
innocent
victims
of
crime
to
keep
a
convicted
criminal
from
committing
more
crimes
we
must
put
him
in
prison
so
he
cannot
harm
more
lawabiding
citizens
to
be
effective
this
punishment
must
be
swift
and
it
must
be
certain
too
often
criminals
are
not
sent
to
prison
after
conviction
but
are
allowed
to
return
to
the
streets
some
judges
are
reluctant
to
send
convicted
criminals
to
prison
because
of
inadequate
facilities
to
alleviate
this
problem
at
the
federal
level
my
new
budget
proposes
the
construction
of
four
new
federal
facilities
to
speed
federal
justice
i
propose
an
increase
this
year
in
the
united
states
attorneys
prosecuting
federal
crimes
and
the
reinforcement
of
the
number
of
united
states
marshals
additional
federal
judges
are
needed
as
recommended
by
me
and
the
judicial
conference
another
major
threat
to
every
americans
person
and
property
is
the
criminal
carrying
a
handgun
the
way
to
cut
down
on
the
criminal
use
of
guns
is
not
to
take
guns
away
from
the
lawabiding
citizen
but
to
impose
mandatory
sentences
for
crimes
in
which
a
gun
is
used
make
it
harder
to
obtain
cheap
guns
for
criminal
purposes
and
concentrate
gun
control
enforcement
in
highcrime
areas
my
budget
recommends
additional
federal
agents
in
the
largest
metropolitan
highcrime
areas
to
help
local
authorities
stop
criminals
from
selling
and
using
handguns
the
sale
of
hard
drugs
is
tragically
on
the
increase
again
i
have
directed
all
agencies
of
the
federal
government
to
step
up
law
enforcement
efforts
against
those
who
deal
in
drugs
in
i
am
glad
to
report
federal
agents
seized
substantially
more
heroin
coming
into
our
country
th
an
in
as
president
i
have
talked
personally
with
the
leaders
of
mexico
colombia
and
turkey
to
urge
greater
efforts
by
their
governments
to
control
effectively
the
production
and
shipment
of
hard
drugs
i
recommended
months
ago
that
the
congress
enact
mandatory
fixed
sentences
for
persons
convicted
of
federal
crimes
involving
the
sale
of
hard
drugs
hard
drugs
we
all
know
degrade
the
spirit
as
they
destroy
the
body
of
their
users
it
is
unrealistic
and
misleading
to
hold
out
the
hope
that
the
federal
government
can
move
into
every
neighborhood
and
clean
up
crime
under
the
constitution
the
greatest
responsibility
for
curbing
crime
lies
with
state
and
local
authorities
they
are
the
frontline
fighters
in
the
war
against
crime
there
are
definite
ways
in
which
the
federal
government
can
help
them
i
will
propose
in
the
new
budget
that
congress
authorize
almost
billion
over
the
next
years
to
assist
state
and
local
governments
to
protect
the
safety
and
property
of
all
their
citizens
as
president
i
pledge
the
strict
enforcement
of
federal
laws
andby
example
support
and
leadershipto
help
state
and
local
authorities
enforce
their
laws
together
we
must
protect
the
victims
of
crime
and
ensure
domestic
tranquility
last
year
i
strongly
recommended
a
year
extension
of
the
existing
revenue
sharing
legislation
which
thus
far
has
provided
billion
to
help
state
and
local
units
of
government
solve
problems
at
home
this
program
has
been
effective
with
decisionmaking
transferred
from
the
federal
government
to
locally
elected
officials
congress
must
act
this
year
or
state
and
local
units
of
government
will
have
to
drop
programs
or
raise
local
taxes
including
my
health
care
program
reforms
i
propose
to
consolidate
some
separate
federal
programs
and
provide
flexible
federal
dollar
grants
to
help
states
cities
and
local
agencies
in
such
important
areas
as
education
child
nutrition
and
social
services
this
flexible
system
will
do
the
job
better
and
do
it
closer
to
home
the
protection
of
the
lives
and
property
of
americans
from
foreign
enemies
is
one
of
my
primary
responsibilities
as
president
in
a
world
of
instant
communications
and
intercontinental
ballistic
missiles
in
a
world
economy
that
is
global
and
interdependent
our
relations
with
other
nations
become
more
not
less
important
to
the
lives
of
americans
america
has
had
a
unique
role
in
the
world
since
the
day
of
our
independence
years
ago
and
ever
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
we
have
bornesuccessfullya
heavy
responsibility
for
ensuring
a
stable
world
order
and
hope
for
human
progress
today
the
state
of
our
foreign
policy
is
sound
and
strong
we
are
at
peace
and
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
keep
it
that
way
our
military
forces
are
capable
and
ready
our
military
power
is
without
equal
and
i
intend
to
keep
it
that
way
our
principal
alliances
with
the
industrial
democracies
of
the
atlantic
community
and
japan
have
never
been
more
solid
a
further
agreement
to
limit
the
strategic
arms
race
may
be
achieved
we
have
an
improving
relationship
with
china
the
worlds
most
populous
nation
the
key
elements
for
peace
among
the
nations
of
the
middle
east
now
exist
our
traditional
friendships
in
latin
america
africa
and
asia
continue
we
have
taken
the
role
of
leadership
in
launching
a
serious
and
hopeful
dialog
between
the
industrial
world
and
the
developing
world
we
have
helped
to
achieve
significant
reform
of
the
international
monetary
system
we
should
be
proud
of
what
america
what
our
country
has
accomplished
in
these
areas
and
i
believe
the
american
people
are
the
american
people
have
heard
too
much
about
how
terrible
our
mistakes
how
evil
our
deeds
and
how
misguided
our
purposes
the
american
people
know
better
the
truth
is
we
are
the
worlds
greatest
democracy
we
remain
the
symbol
of
mans
aspiration
for
liberty
and
wellbeing
we
are
the
embodiment
of
hope
for
progress
i
say
it
is
time
we
quit
downgrading
ourselves
as
a
nation
of
course
it
is
our
responsibility
to
learn
the
right
lesson
from
past
mistakes
it
is
our
duty
to
see
that
they
never
happen
again
but
our
greater
duty
is
to
look
to
the
future
the
worlds
troubles
will
not
go
away
the
american
people
want
strong
and
effective
international
and
defense
policies
in
our
constitutional
system
these
policies
should
reflect
consultation
and
accommodation
between
the
president
and
the
congress
but
in
the
final
analysis
as
the
framers
of
our
constitution
knew
from
hard
experience
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
can
be
conducted
effectively
only
if
there
is
strong
central
direction
that
allows
flexibility
of
action
that
responsibility
clearly
rests
with
the
president
i
pledge
to
the
american
people
policies
which
seek
a
secure
just
and
peaceful
world
i
pledge
to
the
congress
to
work
with
you
to
that
end
we
must
not
face
a
future
in
which
we
can
no
longer
help
our
friends
such
as
angola
even
in
limited
and
carefully
controlled
ways
we
must
not
lose
all
capacity
to
respond
short
of
military
intervention
some
hasty
actions
of
the
congress
during
the
past
yearmost
recently
in
respect
to
angolawere
in
my
view
very
shortsighted
unfortunately
they
are
still
very
much
on
the
minds
of
our
allies
and
our
adversaries
a
strong
defense
posture
gives
weight
to
our
values
and
our
views
in
international
negotiations
it
assures
the
vigor
of
our
alliances
and
it
sustains
our
efforts
to
promote
settlements
of
international
conflicts
only
from
a
position
of
strength
can
we
negotiate
a
balanced
agreement
to
limit
the
growth
of
nuclear
arms
only
a
balanced
agreement
will
serve
our
interests
and
minimize
the
threat
of
nuclear
confrontation
the
defense
budget
i
will
submit
to
the
congress
for
fiscal
year
will
show
an
essential
increase
over
the
current
year
it
provides
for
real
growth
in
purchasing
power
over
this
years
defense
budget
which
includes
the
cost
of
the
allvolunteer
force
we
are
continuing
to
make
economies
to
enhance
the
efficiency
of
our
military
forces
but
the
budget
i
will
submit
represents
the
necessity
of
american
strength
for
the
real
world
in
which
we
live
as
conflict
and
rivalry
persist
in
the
world
our
united
states
intelligence
capabilities
must
be
the
best
in
the
world
the
crippling
of
our
foreign
intelligence
services
increases
the
danger
of
american
involvement
in
direct
armed
conflict
our
adversaries
are
encouraged
to
attempt
new
adventures
while
our
own
ability
to
monitor
events
and
to
influence
events
short
of
military
action
is
undermined
without
effective
intelligence
capability
the
united
states
stands
blindfolded
and
hobbled
in
the
near
future
i
will
take
actions
to
reform
and
strengthen
our
intelligence
community
i
ask
for
your
positive
cooperation
it
is
time
to
go
beyond
sensationalism
and
ensure
an
effective
responsible
and
responsive
intelligence
capability
tonight
i
have
spoken
about
our
problems
at
home
and
abroad
i
have
recommended
policies
that
will
meet
the
challenge
of
our
third
century
i
have
no
doubt
that
our
union
will
endure
better
stronger
and
with
more
individual
freedom
we
can
see
forward
only
dimly
year
years
a
generation
perhaps
like
our
forefathers
we
know
that
if
we
meet
the
challenges
of
our
own
time
with
a
common
sense
of
purpose
and
conviction
if
we
remain
true
to
our
constitution
and
to
our
ideals
then
we
can
know
that
the
future
will
be
better
than
the
past
i
see
america
today
crossing
a
threshold
not
just
because
it
is
our
bicentennial
but
because
we
have
been
tested
in
adversity
we
have
taken
a
new
look
at
what
we
want
to
be
and
what
we
want
our
nation
to
become
i
see
america
resurgent
certain
once
again
that
life
will
be
better
for
our
children
than
it
is
for
us
seeking
strength
that
cannot
be
counted
in
megatons
and
riches
that
cannot
be
eroded
by
inflation
i
see
these
united
states
of
america
moving
forward
as
before
toward
a
more
perfect
union
where
the
government
serves
and
the
people
rule
we
will
not
make
this
happen
simply
by
making
speeches
good
or
bad
yours
or
mine
but
by
hard
work
and
hard
decisions
made
with
courage
and
with
common
sense
i
have
heard
many
inspiring
presidential
speeches
but
the
words
i
remember
best
were
spoken
by
dwight
d
eisenhower
america
is
not
good
because
it
is
great
the
president
said
america
is
great
because
it
is
good
president
eisenhower
was
raised
in
a
poor
but
religious
home
in
the
heart
of
america
his
simple
words
echoed
president
lincolns
eloquent
testament
that
right
makes
might
and
lincoln
in
turn
evoked
the
silent
image
of
george
washington
kneeling
in
prayer
at
valley
forge
so
all
these
magic
memories
which
link
eight
generations
of
americans
are
summed
up
in
the
inscription
just
above
me
how
many
times
have
we
seen
it
in
god
we
trust
let
us
engrave
it
now
in
each
of
our
hearts
as
we
begin
our
bicentennial

mr
speaker
mr
vice
president
members
of
the
th
congress
and
distinguished
guests
twentysix
years
ago
a
freshman
congressman
a
young
fellow
with
lots
of
idealism
who
was
out
to
change
the
world
stood
before
sam
rayburn
in
the
well
of
the
house
and
solemnly
swore
to
the
same
oath
that
all
of
you
took
yesterdayan
unforgettable
experience
and
i
congratulate
you
all
two
days
later
that
same
freshman
stood
at
the
back
of
this
great
chamberover
there
someplaceas
president
truman
all
charged
up
by
his
singlehanded
election
victory
reported
as
the
constitution
requires
on
the
state
of
the
union
when
the
bipartisan
applause
stopped
president
truman
said
i
am
happy
to
report
to
this
st
congress
that
the
state
of
the
union
is
good
our
nation
is
better
able
than
ever
before
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
american
people
and
to
give
them
their
fair
chance
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
it
is
foremost
among
the
nations
of
the
world
in
the
search
for
peace
today
that
freshman
member
from
michigan
stands
where
mr
truman
stood
and
i
must
say
to
you
that
the
state
of
the
union
is
not
good
millions
of
americans
are
out
of
work
recession
and
inflation
are
eroding
the
money
of
millions
more
prices
are
too
high
and
sales
are
too
slow
this
years
federal
deficit
will
be
about
billion
next
years
probably
billion
the
national
debt
will
rise
to
over
billion
our
plant
capacity
and
productivity
are
not
increasing
fast
enough
we
depend
on
others
for
essential
energy
some
people
question
their
governments
ability
to
make
hard
decisions
and
stick
with
them
they
expect
washington
politics
as
usual
yet
what
president
truman
said
on
january
is
even
more
true
in
we
are
better
able
to
meet
our
peoples
needs
all
americans
do
have
a
fairer
chance
to
pursue
happiness
not
only
are
we
still
the
foremost
nation
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
but
todays
prospects
of
attaining
it
are
infinitely
brighter
there
were
million
americans
employed
at
the
start
of
now
there
are
more
than
million
americans
who
have
jobs
in
comparable
dollars
the
average
income
of
the
american
family
has
doubled
during
the
past
years
now
i
want
to
speak
very
bluntly
ive
got
bad
news
and
i
dont
expect
much
if
any
applause
the
american
people
want
action
and
it
will
take
both
the
congress
and
the
president
to
give
them
what
they
want
progress
and
solutions
can
be
achieved
and
they
will
be
achieved
my
message
today
is
not
intended
to
address
all
of
the
complex
needs
of
america
i
will
send
separate
messages
making
specific
recommendations
for
domestic
legislation
such
as
the
extension
of
general
revenue
sharing
and
the
voting
rights
act
the
moment
has
come
to
move
in
a
new
direction
we
can
do
this
by
fashioning
a
new
partnership
between
the
congress
on
the
one
hand
the
white
house
on
the
other
and
the
people
we
both
represent
let
us
mobilize
the
most
powerful
and
most
creative
industrial
nation
that
ever
existed
on
this
earth
to
put
all
our
people
to
work
the
emphasis
on
our
economic
efforts
must
now
shift
from
inflation
to
jobs
to
bolster
business
and
industry
and
to
create
new
jobs
i
propose
a
year
tax
reduction
of
billion
threequarters
would
go
to
individuals
and
onequarter
to
promote
business
investment
this
cash
rebate
to
individuals
amounts
to
percent
of
tax
paymentsa
total
cut
of
billion
with
a
maximum
of
per
return
i
call
on
the
congress
to
act
by
april
if
you
doand
i
hope
you
willthe
treasury
can
send
the
first
check
for
half
of
the
rebate
in
may
and
the
second
by
september
the
other
onefourth
of
the
cut
about
billion
will
go
to
business
including
farms
to
promote
expansion
and
to
create
more
jobs
the
year
reduction
for
businesses
would
be
in
the
form
of
a
liberalized
investment
tax
credit
increasing
the
rate
to
percent
for
all
businesses
this
tax
cut
does
not
include
the
more
fundamental
reforms
needed
in
our
tax
system
but
it
points
us
in
the
right
directionallowing
taxpayers
rather
than
the
government
to
spend
their
pay
cutting
taxes
now
is
essential
if
we
are
to
turn
the
economy
around
a
tax
cut
offers
the
best
hope
of
creating
more
jobs
unfortunately
it
will
increase
the
size
of
the
budget
deficit
therefore
it
is
more
important
than
ever
that
we
take
steps
to
control
the
growth
of
federal
expenditures
part
of
our
trouble
is
that
we
have
been
selfindulgent
for
decades
we
have
been
voting
everincreasing
levels
of
government
benefits
and
now
the
bill
has
come
due
we
have
been
adding
so
many
new
programs
that
the
size
and
the
growth
of
the
federal
budget
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
one
characteristic
of
these
programs
is
that
their
cost
increases
automatically
every
year
because
the
number
of
people
eligible
for
most
of
the
benefits
increases
every
year
when
these
programs
are
enacted
there
is
no
dollar
amount
set
no
one
knows
what
they
will
cost
all
we
know
is
that
whatever
they
cost
last
year
they
will
cost
more
next
year
it
is
a
question
of
simple
arithmetic
unless
we
check
the
excessive
growth
of
federal
expenditures
or
impose
on
ourselves
matching
increases
in
taxes
we
will
continue
to
run
huge
inflationary
deficits
in
the
federal
budget
if
we
project
the
current
builtin
momentum
of
federal
spending
through
the
next
years
state
federal
and
local
government
expenditures
could
easily
comprise
half
of
our
gross
national
product
this
compares
with
less
than
a
third
in
i
have
just
concluded
the
process
of
preparing
the
budget
submissions
for
fiscal
year
in
that
budget
i
will
propose
legislation
to
restrain
the
growth
of
a
number
of
existing
programs
i
have
also
concluded
that
no
new
spending
programs
can
be
initiated
this
year
except
for
energy
further
i
will
not
hesitate
to
veto
any
new
spending
programs
adopted
by
the
congress
as
an
additional
step
toward
putting
the
federal
governments
house
in
order
i
recommend
a
percent
limit
on
federal
pay
increases
in
in
all
government
programs
tied
to
the
consumer
price
indexincluding
social
security
civil
service
and
military
retirement
pay
and
food
stampsi
also
propose
a
year
maximum
increase
of
percent
none
of
these
recommended
ceiling
limitations
over
which
congress
has
final
authority
are
easy
to
propose
because
in
most
cases
they
involve
anticipated
payments
to
many
many
deserving
people
nonetheless
it
must
be
done
i
must
emphasize
that
i
am
not
asking
to
eliminate
to
reduce
to
freeze
these
payments
i
am
merely
recommending
that
we
slow
down
the
rate
at
which
these
payments
increase
and
these
programs
grow
only
a
reduction
in
the
growth
of
spending
can
keep
federal
borrowing
down
and
reduce
the
damage
to
the
private
sector
from
high
interest
rates
only
a
reduction
in
spending
can
make
it
possible
for
the
federal
reserve
system
to
avoid
an
inflationary
growth
in
the
money
supply
and
thus
restore
balance
to
our
economy
a
major
reduction
in
the
growth
of
federal
spending
can
help
dispel
the
uncertainty
that
so
many
feel
about
our
economy
and
put
us
on
the
way
to
curing
our
economic
ills
if
we
dont
act
to
slow
down
the
rate
of
increase
in
federal
spending
the
united
states
treasury
will
be
legally
obligated
to
spend
more
than
billion
in
fiscal
year
even
if
no
new
programs
are
enacted
these
are
not
matters
of
conjecture
or
prediction
but
again
a
matter
of
simple
arithmetic
the
size
of
these
numbers
and
their
implications
for
our
everyday
life
and
the
health
of
our
economic
system
are
shocking
i
submitted
to
the
last
congress
a
list
of
budget
deferrals
and
rescissions
there
will
be
more
cuts
recommended
in
the
budget
that
i
will
submit
even
so
the
level
of
outlays
for
fiscal
year
is
still
much
much
too
high
not
only
is
it
too
high
for
this
year
but
the
decisions
we
make
now
will
inevitably
have
a
major
and
growing
impact
on
expenditure
levels
in
future
years
i
think
this
is
a
very
fundamental
issue
that
we
the
congress
and
i
must
jointly
solve
economic
disruptions
we
and
others
are
experiencing
stem
in
part
from
the
fact
that
the
world
price
of
petroleum
has
quadrupled
in
the
last
year
but
in
all
honesty
we
cannot
put
all
of
the
blame
on
the
oilexporting
nations
we
the
united
states
are
not
blameless
our
growing
dependence
upon
foreign
sources
has
been
adding
to
our
vulnerability
for
years
and
years
and
we
did
nothing
to
prepare
ourselves
for
such
an
event
as
the
embargo
of
during
the
s
this
country
had
a
surplus
capacity
of
crude
oil
which
we
were
able
to
make
available
to
our
trading
partners
whenever
there
was
a
disruption
of
supply
this
surplus
capacity
enabled
us
to
influence
both
supplies
and
prices
of
crude
oil
throughout
the
world
our
excess
capacity
neutralized
any
effort
at
establishing
an
effective
cartel
and
thus
the
rest
of
the
world
was
assured
of
adequate
supplies
of
oil
at
reasonable
prices
by
our
surplus
capacity
had
vanished
and
as
a
consequence
the
latent
power
of
the
oil
cartel
could
emerge
in
full
force
europe
and
japan
both
heavily
dependent
on
imported
oil
now
struggle
to
keep
their
economies
in
balance
even
the
united
states
our
country
which
is
far
more
selfsufficient
than
most
other
industrial
countries
has
been
put
under
serious
pressure
i
am
proposing
a
program
which
will
begin
to
restore
our
countrys
surplus
capacity
in
total
energy
in
this
way
we
will
be
able
to
assure
ourselves
reliable
and
adequate
energy
and
help
foster
a
new
world
energy
stability
for
other
major
consuming
nations
but
this
nation
and
in
fact
the
world
must
face
the
prospect
of
energy
difficulties
between
now
and
this
program
will
impose
burdens
on
all
of
us
with
the
aim
of
reducing
our
consumption
of
energy
and
increasing
our
production
great
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
considerations
of
fairness
and
i
can
assure
you
that
the
burdens
will
not
fall
more
harshly
on
those
less
able
to
bear
them
i
am
recommending
a
plan
to
make
us
invulnerable
to
cutoffs
of
foreign
oil
it
will
require
sacrifices
but
itand
this
is
most
importantit
will
work
i
have
set
the
following
national
energy
goals
to
assure
that
our
future
is
as
secure
and
as
productive
as
our
past
first
we
must
reduce
oil
imports
by
million
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
this
year
and
by
mil
lion
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
second
we
must
end
vulnerability
to
economic
disruption
by
foreign
suppliers
by
third
we
must
develop
our
energy
technology
and
resources
so
that
the
united
states
has
the
ability
to
supply
a
significant
share
of
the
energy
needs
of
the
free
world
by
the
end
of
this
century
to
attain
these
objectives
we
need
immediate
action
to
cut
imports
unfortunately
in
the
short
term
there
are
only
a
limited
number
of
actions
which
can
increase
domestic
supply
i
will
press
for
all
of
them
i
urge
quick
action
on
the
necessary
legislation
to
allow
commercial
production
at
the
elk
hills
california
naval
petroleum
reserve
in
order
that
we
make
greater
use
of
domestic
coal
resources
i
am
submitting
amendments
to
the
energy
supply
and
environmental
coordination
act
which
will
greatly
increase
the
number
of
powerplants
that
can
be
promptly
converted
to
coal
obviously
voluntary
conservation
continues
to
be
essential
but
tougher
programs
are
neededand
needed
now
therefore
i
am
using
presidential
powers
to
raise
the
fee
on
all
imported
crude
oil
and
petroleum
products
the
crude
oil
fee
level
will
be
increased
per
barrel
on
february
by
per
barrel
on
march
and
by
per
barrel
on
april
i
will
take
actions
to
reduce
undue
hardships
on
any
geographical
region
the
foregoing
are
interim
administrative
actions
they
will
be
rescinded
when
the
broader
but
necessary
legislation
is
enacted
to
that
end
i
am
requesting
the
congress
to
act
within
days
on
a
more
comprehensive
energy
tax
program
it
includes
excise
taxes
and
import
fees
totaling
per
barrel
on
product
imports
and
on
all
crude
oil
deregulation
of
new
natural
gas
and
enactment
of
a
natural
gas
excise
tax
i
plan
to
take
presidential
initiative
to
decontrol
the
price
of
domestic
crude
oil
on
april
i
urge
the
congress
to
enact
a
windfall
profits
tax
by
that
date
to
ensure
that
oil
producers
do
not
profit
unduly
the
sooner
congress
acts
the
more
effective
the
oil
conservation
program
will
be
and
the
quicker
the
federal
revenues
can
be
returned
to
our
people
i
am
prepared
to
use
presidential
authority
to
limit
imports
as
necessary
to
guarantee
success
i
want
you
to
know
that
before
deciding
on
my
energy
conservation
program
i
considered
rationing
and
higher
gasoline
taxes
as
alternatives
in
my
judgment
neither
would
achieve
the
desired
results
and
both
would
produce
unacceptable
inequities
a
massive
program
must
be
initiated
to
increase
energy
supply
to
cut
demand
and
provide
new
standby
emergency
programs
to
achieve
the
independence
we
want
by
the
largest
part
of
increased
oil
production
must
come
from
new
frontier
areas
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
from
the
naval
petroleum
reserve
no
in
alaska
it
is
the
intent
of
this
administration
to
move
ahead
with
exploration
leasing
and
production
on
those
frontier
areas
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
where
the
environmental
risks
are
acceptable
use
of
our
most
abundant
domestic
resourcecoalis
severely
limited
we
must
strike
a
reasonable
compromise
on
environmental
concerns
with
coal
i
am
submitting
clean
air
amendments
which
will
allow
greater
coal
use
without
sacrificing
clean
air
goals
i
vetoed
the
strip
mining
legislation
passed
by
the
last
congress
with
appropriate
changes
i
will
sign
a
revised
version
when
it
comes
to
the
white
house
i
am
proposing
a
number
of
actions
to
energize
our
nuclear
power
program
i
will
submit
legislation
to
expedite
nuclear
leasing
and
the
rapid
selection
of
sites
in
recent
months
utilities
have
cancelled
or
postponed
over
percent
of
planned
nuclear
expansion
and
percent
of
planned
additions
to
nonnuclear
capacity
financing
problems
for
that
industry
are
worsening
i
am
therefore
recommending
that
the
year
investment
tax
credit
of
percent
be
extended
an
additional
years
to
specifically
speed
the
construction
of
powerplants
that
do
not
use
natural
gas
or
oil
i
am
also
submitting
proposals
for
selective
reform
of
state
utility
commission
regulations
to
provide
the
critical
stability
for
our
domestic
energy
production
in
the
face
of
world
price
uncertainty
i
will
request
legislation
to
authorize
and
require
tariffs
import
quotas
or
price
floors
to
protect
our
energy
prices
at
levels
which
will
achieve
energy
independence
increasing
energy
supplies
is
not
enough
we
must
take
additional
steps
to
cut
longterm
consumption
i
therefore
propose
to
the
congress
legislation
to
make
thermal
efficiency
standards
mandatory
for
all
new
buildings
in
the
united
states
a
new
tax
credit
of
up
to
for
those
homeowners
who
install
insulation
equipment
the
establishment
of
an
energy
conservation
program
to
help
lowincome
families
purchase
insulation
supplies
legislation
to
modify
and
defer
automotive
pollution
standards
for
years
which
will
enable
us
to
improve
automobile
gas
mileage
by
percent
by
these
proposals
and
actions
cumulatively
can
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
energy
supplies
from
to
million
barrels
per
day
by
to
make
the
united
states
invulnerable
to
foreign
disruption
i
propose
standby
emergency
legislation
and
a
strategic
storage
program
of
billion
barrels
of
oil
for
domestic
needs
and
million
barrels
for
national
defense
purposes
i
will
ask
for
the
funds
needed
for
energy
research
and
development
activities
i
have
established
a
goal
of
million
barrels
of
synthetic
fuels
and
shale
oil
production
per
day
by
together
with
an
incentive
program
to
achieve
it
i
have
a
very
deep
belief
in
americas
capabilities
within
the
next
years
my
program
envisions
major
nuclear
powerplants
major
new
coal
mines
major
coalfired
powerplants
major
new
refineries
major
new
synthetic
fuel
plants
the
drilling
of
many
thousands
of
new
oil
wells
the
insulation
of
million
homes
and
the
manufacturing
and
the
sale
of
millions
of
new
automobiles
trucks
and
buses
that
use
much
less
fuel
i
happen
to
believe
that
we
can
do
it
in
another
crisisthe
one
in
president
franklin
d
roosevelt
said
this
country
would
build
military
aircraft
by
production
in
that
program
had
reached
aircraft
annually
they
did
it
then
we
can
do
it
now
if
the
congress
and
the
american
people
will
work
with
me
to
attain
these
targets
they
will
be
achieved
and
will
be
surpassed
from
adversity
let
us
seize
opportunity
revenues
of
some
billion
from
higher
energy
taxes
designed
to
encourage
conservation
must
be
refunded
to
the
american
people
in
a
manner
which
corrects
distortions
in
our
tax
system
wrought
by
inflation
people
have
been
pushed
into
higher
tax
brackets
by
inflation
with
consequent
reduction
in
their
actual
spending
power
business
taxes
are
similarly
distorted
because
inflation
exaggerates
reported
profits
resulting
in
excessive
taxes
accordingly
i
propose
that
future
individual
income
taxes
be
reduced
by
billion
this
will
be
done
by
raising
the
lowincome
allowance
and
reducing
tax
rates
this
continuing
tax
cut
will
primarily
benefit
lower
and
middleincome
taxpayers
for
example
a
typical
family
of
four
with
a
gross
income
of
now
pays
in
federal
income
taxes
under
this
tax
cut
plan
they
would
pay
nothing
a
family
of
four
with
a
gross
income
of
now
pays
in
federal
taxes
my
proposal
reduces
that
total
by
families
grossing
would
receive
a
reduction
of
those
with
the
very
lowest
incomes
who
can
least
afford
higher
costs
must
also
be
compensated
i
propose
a
payment
of
to
every
person
years
of
age
and
older
in
that
very
limited
category
state
and
local
governments
will
receive
billion
in
additional
revenue
sharing
to
offset
their
increased
energy
costs
to
offset
inflationary
distortions
and
to
generate
more
economic
activity
the
corporate
tax
rate
will
be
reduced
from
percent
to
percent
now
let
me
turn
if
i
might
to
the
international
dimension
of
the
present
crisis
at
no
time
in
our
peacetime
history
has
the
state
of
the
nation
depended
more
heavily
on
the
state
of
the
world
and
seldom
if
ever
has
the
state
of
the
world
depended
more
heavily
on
the
state
of
our
nation
the
economic
distress
is
global
we
will
not
solve
it
at
home
unless
we
help
to
remedy
the
profound
economic
dislocation
abroad
world
trade
and
monetary
structure
provides
markets
energy
food
and
vital
raw
materialsfor
all
nations
this
international
system
is
now
in
jeopardy
this
nation
can
be
proud
of
significant
achievements
in
recent
years
in
solving
problems
and
crises
the
berlin
agreement
the
salt
agreements
our
new
relationship
with
china
the
unprecedented
efforts
in
the
middle
east
are
immensely
encouraging
but
the
world
is
not
free
from
crisis
in
a
world
of
nations
where
nuclear
technology
is
proliferating
and
regional
conflicts
continue
international
security
cannot
be
taken
for
granted
so
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
it
international
cooperation
is
a
vital
factor
of
our
lives
today
this
is
not
a
moment
for
the
american
people
to
turn
inward
more
than
ever
before
our
own
wellbeing
depends
on
americas
determination
and
americas
leadership
in
the
whole
wide
world
we
are
a
great
nationspiritually
politically
militarily
diplomatically
and
economically
americas
commitment
to
international
security
has
sustained
the
safety
of
allies
and
friends
in
many
areasin
the
middle
east
in
europe
and
in
asia
our
turning
away
would
unleash
new
instabilities
new
dangers
around
the
globe
which
in
turn
would
threaten
our
own
security
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
we
turned
a
similar
challenge
into
an
historic
opportunity
and
i
might
add
an
historic
achievement
an
old
order
was
in
disarray
political
and
economic
institutions
were
shattered
in
that
period
this
nation
and
its
partners
built
new
institutions
new
mechanisms
of
mutual
support
and
cooperation
today
as
then
we
face
an
historic
opportunity
if
we
act
imaginatively
and
boldly
as
we
acted
then
this
period
will
in
retrospect
be
seen
as
one
of
the
great
creative
moments
of
our
nations
history
the
whole
world
is
watching
to
see
how
we
respond
a
resurgent
american
economy
would
do
more
to
restore
the
confidence
of
the
world
in
its
own
future
than
anything
else
we
can
do
the
program
that
this
congress
passes
can
demonstrate
to
the
world
that
we
hav
e
started
to
put
our
own
house
in
order
if
we
can
show
that
this
nation
is
able
and
willing
to
help
other
nations
meet
the
common
challenge
it
can
demonstrate
that
the
united
states
will
fulfill
its
responsibilities
as
a
leader
among
nations
quite
frankly
at
stake
is
the
future
of
industrialized
democracies
which
have
perceived
their
destiny
in
common
and
sustained
it
in
common
for
years
the
developing
nations
are
also
at
a
turning
point
the
poorest
nations
see
their
hopes
of
feeding
their
hungry
and
developing
their
societies
shattered
by
the
economic
crisis
the
longterm
economic
future
for
the
producers
of
raw
materials
also
depends
on
cooperative
solutions
our
relations
with
the
communist
countries
are
a
basic
factor
of
the
world
environment
we
must
seek
to
build
a
longterm
basis
for
coexistence
we
will
stand
by
our
principles
we
will
stand
by
our
interests
we
will
act
firmly
when
challenged
the
kind
of
a
world
we
want
depends
on
a
broad
policy
of
creating
mutual
incentives
for
restraint
and
for
cooperation
as
we
move
forward
to
meet
our
global
challenges
and
opportunities
we
must
have
the
tools
to
do
the
job
our
military
forces
are
strong
and
ready
this
military
strength
deters
aggression
against
our
allies
stabilizes
our
relations
with
former
adversaries
and
protects
our
homeland
fully
adequate
conventional
and
strategic
forces
cost
many
many
billions
but
these
dollars
are
sound
insurance
for
our
safety
and
for
a
more
peaceful
world
military
strength
alone
is
not
sufficient
effective
diplomacy
is
also
essential
in
preventing
conflict
in
building
world
understanding
the
vladivostok
negotiations
with
the
soviet
union
represent
a
major
step
in
moderating
strategic
arms
competition
my
recent
discussions
with
the
leaders
of
the
atlantic
community
japan
and
south
korea
have
contributed
to
meeting
the
common
challenge
but
we
have
serious
problems
before
us
that
require
cooperation
between
the
president
and
the
congress
by
the
constitution
and
tradition
the
execution
of
foreign
policy
is
the
responsibility
of
the
president
in
recent
years
under
the
stress
of
the
vietnam
war
legislative
restrictions
on
the
presidents
ability
to
execute
foreign
policy
and
military
decisions
have
proliferated
as
a
member
of
the
congress
i
opposed
some
and
i
approved
others
as
president
i
welcome
the
advice
and
cooperation
of
the
house
and
the
senate
but
if
our
foreign
policy
is
to
be
successful
we
cannot
rigidly
restrict
in
legislation
the
ability
of
the
president
to
act
the
conduct
of
negotiations
is
illsuited
to
such
limitations
legislative
restrictions
intended
for
the
best
motives
and
purposes
can
have
the
opposite
result
as
we
have
seen
most
recently
in
our
trade
relations
with
the
soviet
union
for
my
part
i
pledge
this
administration
will
act
in
the
closest
consultation
with
the
congress
as
we
face
delicate
situations
and
troubled
times
throughout
the
globe
when
i
became
president
only
months
ago
i
promised
the
last
congress
a
policy
of
communication
conciliation
compromise
and
cooperation
i
renew
that
pledge
to
the
new
members
of
this
congress
let
me
sum
it
up
america
needs
a
new
direction
which
i
have
sought
to
chart
here
todaya
change
of
course
which
will
put
the
unemployed
back
to
work
increase
real
income
and
production
restrain
the
growth
of
federal
government
spending
achieve
energy
independence
and
advance
the
cause
of
world
understanding
we
have
the
ability
we
have
the
knowhow
in
partnership
with
the
american
people
we
will
achieve
these
objectives
as
our
th
anniversary
approaches
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
and
to
posterity
to
rebuild
our
political
and
economic
strength
let
us
make
america
once
again
and
for
centuries
more
to
come
what
it
has
so
long
beena
stronghold
and
a
beaconlight
of
liberty
for
the
whole
world
thank
you

mr
speaker
mr
president
my
colleagues
in
the
congress
our
distinguished
guests
my
fellow
americans
we
meet
here
tonight
at
a
time
of
great
challenge
and
great
opportunities
for
america
we
meet
at
a
time
when
we
face
great
problems
at
home
and
abroad
that
will
test
the
strength
of
our
fiber
as
a
nation
but
we
also
meet
at
a
time
when
that
fiber
has
been
tested
and
it
has
proved
strong
america
is
a
great
and
good
land
and
we
are
a
great
and
good
land
because
we
are
a
strong
free
creative
people
and
because
america
is
the
single
greatest
force
for
peace
anywhere
in
the
world
today
as
always
in
our
history
we
can
base
our
confidence
in
what
the
american
people
will
achieve
in
the
future
on
the
record
of
what
the
american
people
have
achieved
in
the
past
tonight
for
the
first
time
in
years
a
president
of
the
united
states
can
report
to
the
congress
on
the
state
of
a
union
at
peace
with
every
nation
of
the
world
because
of
this
in
the
word
message
on
the
state
of
the
union
that
i
have
just
handed
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
of
the
senate
i
have
been
able
to
deal
primarily
with
the
problems
of
peace
with
what
we
can
do
here
at
home
in
america
for
the
american
peoplerather
than
with
the
problems
of
war
the
measures
i
have
outlined
in
this
message
set
an
agenda
for
truly
significant
progress
for
this
nation
and
the
world
in
before
we
chart
where
we
are
going
let
us
see
how
far
we
have
come
it
was
years
ago
on
the
steps
of
this
capitol
that
i
took
the
oath
of
office
as
your
president
in
those
years
because
of
the
initiatives
undertaken
by
this
administration
the
world
has
changed
america
has
changed
as
a
result
of
those
changes
america
is
safer
today
more
prosperous
today
with
greater
opportunity
for
more
of
its
people
than
ever
before
in
our
history
five
years
ago
america
was
at
war
in
southeast
asia
we
were
locked
in
confrontation
with
the
soviet
union
we
were
in
hostile
isolation
from
a
quarter
of
the
worlds
people
who
lived
in
mainland
china
five
years
ago
our
cities
were
burning
and
besieged
five
years
ago
our
college
campuses
were
a
battleground
five
years
ago
crime
was
increasing
at
a
rate
that
struck
fear
across
the
nation
five
years
ago
the
spiraling
rise
in
drug
addiction
was
threatening
human
and
social
tragedy
of
massive
proportion
and
there
was
no
program
to
deal
with
it
five
years
agoas
young
americans
had
done
for
a
generation
before
thatamericas
youth
still
lived
under
the
shadow
of
the
military
draft
five
years
ago
there
was
no
national
program
to
preserve
our
environment
day
by
day
our
air
was
getting
dirtier
our
water
was
getting
more
foul
and
years
ago
american
agriculture
was
practically
a
depressed
industry
with
farm
families
abandoning
the
farm
every
year
as
we
look
at
america
today
we
find
ourselves
challenged
by
new
problems
but
we
also
find
a
record
of
progress
to
confound
the
professional
criers
of
doom
and
prophets
of
despair
we
met
the
challenges
we
faced
years
ago
and
we
will
be
equally
confident
of
meeting
those
that
we
face
today
let
us
see
for
a
moment
how
we
have
met
them
after
more
than
years
of
military
involvement
all
of
our
troops
have
returned
from
southeast
asia
and
they
have
returned
with
honor
and
we
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
our
courageous
prisoners
of
war
for
whom
a
dinner
was
held
in
washington
tonight
that
they
came
home
with
their
heads
high
on
their
feet
and
not
on
their
knees
in
our
relations
with
the
soviet
union
we
have
turned
away
from
a
policy
of
confrontation
to
one
of
negotiation
for
the
first
time
since
world
war
ii
the
worlds
two
strongest
powers
are
working
together
toward
peace
in
the
world
with
the
peoples
republic
of
china
after
a
generation
of
hostile
isolation
we
have
begun
a
period
of
peaceful
exchange
and
expanding
trade
peace
has
returned
to
our
cities
to
our
campuses
the
year
rise
in
crime
has
been
stopped
we
can
confidently
say
today
that
we
are
finally
beginning
to
win
the
war
against
crime
right
here
in
this
nations
capitalwhich
a
few
years
ago
was
threatening
to
become
the
crime
capital
of
the
worldthe
rate
in
crime
has
been
cut
in
half
a
massive
campaign
against
drug
abuse
has
been
organized
and
the
rate
of
new
heroin
addiction
the
most
vicious
threat
of
all
is
decreasing
rather
than
increasing
for
the
first
time
in
a
generation
no
young
americans
are
being
drafted
into
the
armed
services
of
the
united
states
and
for
the
first
time
ever
we
have
organized
a
massive
national
effort
to
protect
the
environment
our
air
is
getting
cleaner
our
water
is
getting
purer
and
our
agriculture
which
was
depressed
is
prospering
farm
income
is
up
percent
farm
production
is
setting
alltime
records
and
the
billions
of
dollars
the
taxpayers
were
paying
in
subsidies
has
been
cut
to
nearly
zero
overall
americans
are
living
more
abundantly
than
ever
before
today
more
than
million
new
jobs
were
created
in
the
past
year
alone
that
is
the
biggest
percentage
increase
in
nearly
years
people
are
earning
more
what
they
earn
buys
more
more
than
ever
before
in
history
in
the
past
years
the
average
americans
real
spendable
incomethat
is
what
you
really
can
buy
with
your
income
even
after
allowing
for
taxes
and
inflationhas
increased
by
percent
despite
this
record
of
achievement
as
we
turn
to
the
year
ahead
we
hear
once
again
the
familiar
voice
of
the
perennial
prophets
of
gloom
telling
us
now
that
because
of
the
need
to
fight
inflation
because
of
the
energy
shortage
america
may
be
headed
for
a
recession
let
me
speak
to
that
issue
head
on
there
will
be
no
recession
in
the
united
states
of
america
primarily
due
to
our
energy
crisis
our
economy
is
passing
through
a
difficult
period
but
i
pledge
to
you
tonight
that
the
full
powers
of
this
government
will
be
used
to
keep
americas
economy
producing
and
to
protect
the
jobs
of
americas
workers
we
are
engaged
in
a
long
and
hard
fight
against
inflation
there
have
been
and
there
will
be
in
the
future
ups
and
downs
in
that
fight
but
if
this
congress
cooperates
in
our
efforts
to
hold
down
the
cost
of
government
we
shall
win
our
fight
to
hold
down
the
cost
of
living
for
the
american
people
as
we
look
back
over
our
history
the
years
that
stand
out
as
the
ones
of
signal
achievement
are
those
in
which
the
administration
and
the
congress
whether
one
party
or
the
other
working
together
had
the
wisdom
and
the
foresight
to
select
those
particular
initiatives
for
which
the
nation
was
ready
and
the
moment
was
rightand
in
which
they
seized
the
moment
and
acted
looking
at
the
year
which
lies
before
us
there
are
key
areas
in
which
landmark
accomplishments
are
possible
this
year
in
america
if
we
make
these
our
national
agenda
this
is
what
we
will
achieve
in
we
will
break
the
back
of
the
energy
crisis
we
will
lay
the
foundation
for
our
future
capacity
to
meet
americas
energy
needs
from
americas
own
resources
and
we
will
take
another
giant
stride
toward
lasting
peace
in
the
worldnot
only
by
continuing
our
policy
of
negotiation
rather
than
confrontation
where
the
great
powers
are
concerned
but
also
by
helping
toward
the
achievement
of
a
just
and
lasting
settlement
in
the
middle
east
we
will
check
the
rise
in
prices
without
administering
the
harsh
medicine
of
recession
and
we
will
move
the
economy
into
a
steady
period
of
growth
at
a
sustainable
level
we
will
establish
a
new
system
that
makes
highquality
health
care
available
to
every
american
in
a
dignified
manner
and
at
a
price
he
can
afford
we
will
make
our
states
and
localities
more
responsive
to
the
needs
of
their
own
citizens
we
will
make
a
crucial
breakthrough
toward
better
transportation
in
our
towns
and
in
our
cities
across
america
we
will
reform
our
system
of
federal
aid
to
education
to
provide
it
when
it
is
needed
where
it
is
needed
so
that
it
will
do
the
most
for
those
who
need
it
the
most
we
will
make
an
historic
beginning
on
the
task
of
defining
and
protecting
the
right
of
personal
privacy
for
every
american
and
we
will
start
on
a
new
road
toward
reform
of
a
welfare
system
that
bleeds
the
taxpayer
corrodes
the
community
and
demeans
those
it
is
intended
to
assist
and
together
with
the
other
nations
of
the
world
we
will
establish
the
economic
framework
within
which
americans
will
share
more
fully
in
an
expanding
worldwide
trade
and
prosperity
in
the
years
ahead
with
more
open
access
to
both
markets
and
supplies
in
all
of
the
state
of
the
union
messages
delivered
from
this
place
in
our
history
this
is
the
first
in
which
the
one
priority
the
first
priority
is
energy
let
me
begin
by
reporting
a
new
development
which
i
know
will
be
welcome
news
to
every
american
as
you
know
we
have
committed
ourselves
to
an
active
role
in
helping
to
achieve
a
just
and
durable
peace
in
the
middle
east
on
the
basis
of
full
implementation
of
security
council
resolutions
and
the
first
step
in
the
process
is
the
disengagement
of
egyptian
and
israeli
forces
which
is
now
taking
place
because
of
this
hopeful
development
i
can
announce
tonight
that
i
have
been
assured
through
my
personal
contacts
with
friendly
leaders
in
the
middle
eastern
area
that
an
urgent
meeting
will
be
called
in
the
immediate
future
to
discuss
the
lifting
of
the
oil
embargo
this
is
an
encouraging
sign
however
it
should
be
clearly
understood
by
our
friends
in
the
middle
east
that
the
united
states
will
not
be
coerced
on
this
issue
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
meeting
the
cooperation
of
the
american
people
in
our
energy
conservation
program
has
already
gone
a
long
way
towards
achieving
a
goal
to
which
i
am
deeply
dedicated
let
us
do
everything
we
can
to
avoid
gasoline
rationing
in
the
united
states
of
america
last
week
i
sent
to
the
congress
a
comprehensive
special
message
setting
forth
our
energy
situation
recommending
the
legislative
measures
which
are
necessary
to
a
program
for
meeting
our
needs
if
the
embargo
is
lifted
this
will
ease
the
crisis
but
it
will
not
mean
an
end
to
the
energy
shortage
in
america
voluntary
conservation
will
continue
to
be
necessary
and
let
me
take
this
occasion
to
pay
tribute
once
again
to
the
splendid

spirit
of
cooperation
the
american
people
have
shown
which
has
made
possible
our
success
in
meeting
this
emergency
up
to
this
time
the
new
legislation
i
have
requested
will
also
remain
necessary
therefore
i
urge
again
that
the
energy
measures
that
i
have
proposed
be
made
the
first
priority
of
this
session
of
the
congress
these
measures
will
require
the
oil
companies
and
other
energy
producers
to
provide
the
public
with
the
necessary
information
on
their
supplies
they
will
prevent
the
injustice
of
windfall
profits
for
a
few
as
a
result
of
the
sacrifices
of
the
millions
of
americans
and
they
will
give
us
the
organization
the
incentives
the
authorities
needed
to
deal
with
the
shortterm
emergency
and
to
move
toward
meeting
our
longterm
needs
just
as
was
the
year
in
which
we
began
a
fullscale
effort
to
protect
the
environment
must
be
the
year
in
which
we
organize
a
fullscale
effort
to
provide
for
our
energy
needs
not
only
in
this
decade
but
through
the
st
century
as
we
move
toward
the
celebration
years
from
now
of
the
th
anniversary
of
this
nations
independence
let
us
press
vigorously
on
toward
the
goal
i
announced
last
november
for
project
independence
let
this
be
our
national
goal
at
the
end
of
this
decade
in
the
year
the
united
states
will
not
be
dependent
on
any
other
country
for
the
energy
we
need
to
provide
our
jobs
to
heat
our
homes
and
to
keep
our
transportation
moving
to
indicate
the
size
of
the
government
commitment
to
spur
energy
research
and
development
we
plan
to
spend
billion
in
federal
funds
over
the
next
years
that
is
an
enormous
amount
but
during
the
same
years
private
enterprise
will
be
investing
as
much
as
billionand
in
years
billionto
develop
the
new
resources
the
new
technology
the
new
capacity
america
will
require
for
its
energy
needs
in
the
s
that
is
just
a
measure
of
the
magnitude
of
the
project
we
are
undertaking
but
america
performs
best
when
called
to
its
biggest
tasks
it
can
truly
be
said
that
only
in
america
could
a
task
so
tremendous
be
achieved
so
quickly
and
achieved
not
by
regimentation
but
through
the
effort
and
ingenuity
of
a
free
people
working
in
a
free
system
turning
now
to
the
rest
of
the
agenda
for
the
time
is
at
hand
this
year
to
bring
comprehensive
high
quality
health
care
within
the
reach
of
every
american
i
shall
propose
a
sweeping
new
program
that
will
assure
comprehensive
health
insurance
protection
to
millions
of
americans
who
cannot
now
obtain
it
or
afford
it
with
vastly
improved
protection
against
catastrophic
illnesses
this
will
be
a
plan
that
maintains
the
high
standards
of
quality
in
americas
health
care
and
it
will
not
require
additional
taxes
now
i
recognize
that
other
plans
have
been
put
forward
that
would
cost
billion
or
even
billion
and
that
would
put
our
whole
health
care
system
under
the
heavy
hand
of
the
federal
government
this
is
the
wrong
approach
this
has
been
tried
abroad
and
it
has
failed
it
is
not
the
way
we
do
things
here
in
america
this
kind
of
plan
would
threaten
the
quality
of
care
provided
by
our
whole
health
care
system
the
right
way
is
one
that
builds
on
the
strengths
of
the
present
system
and
one
that
does
not
destroy
those
strengths
one
based
on
partnership
not
paternalism
most
important
of
all
let
us
keep
this
as
the
guiding
principle
of
our
health
programs
government
has
a
great
role
to
play
but
we
must
always
make
sure
that
our
doctors
will
be
working
for
their
patients
and
not
for
the
federal
government
many
of
you
will
recall
that
in
my
state
of
the
union
address
years
ago
i
commented
that
most
americans
today
are
simply
fed
up
with
government
at
all
levels
and
i
recommended
a
sweeping
set
of
proposals
to
revitalize
state
and
local
governments
to
make
them
more
responsive
to
the
people
they
serve
i
can
report
to
you
today
that
as
a
result
of
revenue
sharing
passed
by
the
congress
and
other
measures
we
have
made
progress
toward
that
goal
after
years
of
moving
power
from
the
states
and
the
communities
to
washington
dc
we
have
begun
moving
power
back
from
washington
to
the
states
and
communities
and
most
important
to
the
people
of
america
in
this
session
of
the
congress
i
believe
we
are
near
the
breakthrough
point
on
efforts
which
i
have
suggested
proposals
to
let
people
themselves
make
their
own
decisions
for
their
own
communities
and
in
particular
on
those
to
provide
broad
new
flexibility
in
federal
aid
for
community
development
for
economic
development
for
education
and
i
look
forward
to
working
with
the
congress
with
members
of
both
parties
in
resolving
whatever
remaining
differences
we
have
in
this
legislation
so
that
we
can
make
available
nearly
billion
to
our
states
and
localities
to
use
not
for
what
a
federal
bureaucrat
may
want
but
for
what
their
own
people
in
those
communities
want
the
decision
should
be
theirs
i
think
all
of
us
recognize
that
the
energy
crisis
has
given
new
urgency
to
the
need
to
improve
public
transportation
not
only
in
our
cities
but
in
rural
areas
as
well
the
program
i
have
proposed
this
year
will
give
communities
not
only
more
money
but
also
more
freedom
to
balance
their
own
transportation
needs
it
will
mark
the
strongest
federal
commitment
ever
to
the
improvement
of
mass
transit
as
an
essential
element
of
the
improvement
of
life
in
our
towns
and
cities
one
goal
on
which
all
americans
agree
is
that
our
children
should
have
the
very
best
education
this
great
nation
can
provide
in
a
special
message
last
week
i
recommended
a
number
of
important
new
measures
that
can
make
a
year
of
truly
significant
advances
for
our
schools
and
for
the
children
they
serve
if
the
congress
will
act
on
these
proposals
more
flexible
funding
will
enable
each
federal
dollar
to
meet
better
the
particular
need
of
each
particular
school
district
advance
funding
will
give
school
authorities
a
chance
to
make
each
years
plans
knowing
ahead
of
time
what
federal
funds
they
are
going
to
receive
special
targeting
will
give
special
help
to
the
truly
disadvantaged
among
our
people
college
students
faced
with
rising
costs
for
their
education
will
be
able
to
draw
on
an
expanded
program
of
loans
and
grants
these
advances
are
a
needed
investment
in
americas
most
precious
resource
our
next
generation
and
i
urge
the
congress
to
act
on
this
legislation
in
one
measure
of
a
truly
free
society
is
the
vigor
with
which
it
protects
the
liberties
of
its
individual
citizens
as
technology
has
advanced
in
america
it
has
increasingly
encroached
on
one
of
those
libertieswhat
i
term
the
right
of
personal
privacy
modern
information
systems
data
banks
credit
records
mailing
list
abuses
electronic
snooping
the
collection
of
personal
data
for
one
purpose
that
may
be
used
for
anotherall
these
have
left
millions
of
americans
deeply
concerned
by
the
privacy
they
cherish
and
the
time
has
come
therefore
for
a
major
initiative
to
define
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
basic
rights
of
privacy
and
to
erect
new
safeguards
to
ensure
that
those
rights
are
respected
i
shall
launch
such
an
effort
this
year
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
administration
and
i
look
forward
again
to
working
with
this
congress
in
establishing
a
new
set
of
standards
that
respect
the
legitimate
needs
of
society
but
that
also
recognize
personal
privacy
as
a
cardinal
principle
of
american
liberty
many
of
those
in
this
chamber
tonight
will
recall
that
it
was
years
ago
that
i
termed
the
nations
welfare
system
a
monstrous
consuming
outragean
outrage
against
the
community
against
the
taxpayer
and
particularly
against
the
children
that
it
is
supposed
to
help
that
system
is
still
an
outrage
by
improving
its
administration
we
have
been
able
to
reduce
some
of
the
abuses
as
a
result
last
year
for
the
first
time
in
years
there
has
been
a
halt
in
the
growth
of
the
welfare
caseload
but
as
a
system
our
welfare
program
still
needs
reform
as
urgently
today
as
it
did
when
i
first
proposed
in
that
we
completely
replace
it
with
a
different
system
in
these
final
years
of
my
administration
i
urge
the
congress
to
join
me
in
mounting
a
major
new
effort
to
replace
the
discredited
present
welfare
system
with
one
that
works
one
that
is
fair
to
those
who
need
help
or
cannot
help
themselves
fair
to
the
community
and
fair
to
the
taxpayer
and
let
us
have
as
our
goal
that
there
will
be
no
government
program
which
makes
it
more
profitable
to
go
on
welfare
than
to
go
to
work
i
recognize
that
from
the
debates
that
have
taken
place
within
the
congress
over
the
past
years
on
this
program
that
we
cannot
expect
enactment
overnight
of
a
new
reform
but
i
do
propose
that
the
congress
and
the
administration
together
make
this
the
year
in
which
we
discuss
debate
and
shape
such
a
reform
so
that
it
can
be
enacted
as
quickly
as
possible
americas
own
prosperity
in
the
years
ahead
depends
on
our
sharing
fully
and
equitably
in
an
expanding
world
prosperity
historic
negotiations
will
take
place
this
year
that
will
enable
us
to
ensure
fair
treatment
in
international
markets
for
american
workers
american
farmers
american
investors
and
american
consumers
it
is
vital
that
the
authorities
contained
in
the
trade
bill
i
submitted
to
the
congress
be
enacted
so
that
the
united
states
can
negotiate
flexibly
and
vigorously
on
behalf
of
american
interests
these
negotiations
can
usher
in
a
new
era
of
international
trade
that
not
only
increases
the
prosperity
of
all
nations
but
also
strengthens
the
peace
among
all
nations
in
the
past
years
we
have
made
more
progress
toward
a
lasting
structure
of
peace
in
the
world
than
in
any
comparable
time
in
the
nations
history
we
could
not
have
made
that
progress
if
we
had
not
maintained
the
military
strength
of
america
thomas
jefferson
once
observed
that
the
price
of
liberty
is
eternal
vigilance
by
the
same
token
and
for
the
same
reason
in
todays
world
the
price
of
peace
is
a
strong
defense
as
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned
in
the
past
years
we
have
steadily
reduced
the
burden
of
national
defense
as
a
share
of
the
budget
bringing
it
down
from
percent
in
to
percent
in
the
current
year
we
have
cut
our
military
manpower
over
the

past
years
by
more
than
a
third
from
million
to
million
in
the
coming
year
however
increased
expenditures
will
be
needed
they
will
be
needed
to
assure
the
continued
readiness
of
our
military
forces
to
preserve
present
force
levels
in
the
face
of
rising
costs
and
to
give
us
the
military
strength
we
must
have
if
our
security
is
to
be
maintained
and
if
our
initiatives
for
peace
are
to
succeed
the
question
is
not
whether
we
can
afford
to
maintain
the
necessary
strength
of
our
defense
the
question
is
whether
we
can
afford
not
to
maintain
it
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no
we
must
never
allow
america
to
become
the
second
strongest
nation
in
the
world
i
do
not
say
this
with
any
sense
of
belligerence
because
i
recognize
the
fact
that
is
recognized
around
the
world
americas
military
strength
has
always
been
maintained
to
keep
the
peace
never
to
break
it
it
has
always
been
used
to
defend
freedom
never
to
destroy
it
the
worlds
peace
as
well
as
our
own
depends
on
our
remaining
as
strong
as
we
need
to
be
as
long
as
we
need
to
be
in
this
year
we
will
be
negotiating
with
the
soviet
union
to
place
further
limits
on
strategic
nuclear
arms
together
with
our
allies
we
will
be
negotiating
with
the
nations
of
the
warsaw
pact
on
mutual
and
balanced
reduction
of
forces
in
europe
and
we
will
continue
our
efforts
to
promote
peaceful
economic
development
in
latin
america
in
africa
in
asia
we
will
press
for
full
compliance
with
the
peace
accords
that
brought
an
end
to
american
fighting
in
indochina
including
particularly
a
provision
that
promised
the
fullest
possible
accounting
for
those
americans
who
are
missing
in
action
and
having
in
mind
the
energy
crisis
to
which
i
have
referred
to
earlier
we
will
be
working
with
the
other
nations
of
the
world
toward
agreement
on
means
by
which
oil
supplies
can
be
assured
at
reasonable
prices
on
a
stable
basis
in
a
fair
way
to
the
consuming
and
producing
nations
alike
all
of
these
are
steps
toward
a
future
in
which
the
worlds
peace
and
prosperity
and
ours
as
well
as
a
result
are
made
more
secure
throughout
the
years
that
i
have
served
as
your
president
i
have
had
one
overriding
aim
and
that
was
to
establish
a
new
structure
of
peace
in
the
world
that
can
free
future
generations
of
the
scourge
of
war
i
can
understand
that
others
may
have
different
priorities
this
has
been
and
this
will
remain
my
first
priority
and
the
chief
legacy
i
hope
to
leave
from
the
years
of
my
presidency
this
does
not
mean
that
we
shall
not
have
other
priorities
because
as
we
strengthen
the
peace
we
must
also
continue
each
year
a
steady
strengthening
of
our
society
here
at
home
our
conscience
requires
it
our
interests
require
it
and
we
must
insist
upon
it
as
we
create
more
jobs
as
we
build
a
better
health
care
system
as
we
improve
our
education
as
we
develop
new
sources
of
energy
as
we
provide
more
abundantly
for
the
elderly
and
the
poor
as
we
strengthen
the
system
of
private
enterprise
that
produces
our
prosperityas
we
do
all
of
this
and
even
more
we
solidify
those
essential
bonds
that
hold
us
together
as
a
nation
even
more
importantly
we
advance
what
in
the
final
analysis
government
in
america
is
all
about
what
it
is
all
about
is
more
freedom
more
security
a
better
life
for
each
one
of
the
million
people
that
live
in
this
land
we
cannot
afford
to
neglect
progress
at
home
while
pursuing
peace
abroad
but
neither
can
we
afford
to
neglect
peace
abroad
while
pursuing
progress
at
home
with
a
stable
peace
all
is
possible
but
without
peace
nothing
is
possible
in
the
written
message
that
i
have
just
delivered
to
the
speaker
and
to
the
president
of
the
senate
i
commented
that
one
of
the
continuing
challenges
facing
us
in
the
legislative
process
is
that
of
the
timing
and
pacing
of
our
initiatives
selecting
each
year
among
many
worthy
projects
those
that
are
ripe
for
action
at
that
time
what
is
true
in
terms
of
our
domestic
initiatives
is
true
also
in
the
world
this
period
we
now
are
in
in
the
worldand
i
say
this
as
one
who
has
seen
so
much
of
the
world
not
only
in
these
past
years
but
going
back
over
many
yearswe
are
in
a
period
which
presents
a
juncture
of
historic
forces
unique
in
this
century
they
provide
an
opportunity
we
may
never
have
again
to
create
a
structure
of
peace
solid
enough
to
last
a
lifetime
and
more
not
just
peace
in
our
time
but
peace
in
our
childrens
time
as
well
it
is
on
the
way
we
respond
to
this
opportunity
more
than
anything
else
that
history
will
judge
whether
we
in
america
have
met
our
responsibility
and
i
am
confident
we
will
meet
that
great
historic
responsibility
which
is
ours
today
it
was
years
ago
that
john
f
kennedy
and
i
sat
in
this
chamber
as
freshmen
congressmen
hearing
our
first
state
of
the
union
address
delivered
by
harry
truman
i
know
from
my
talks
with
him
as
members
of
the
labor
committee
on
which
we
both
served
that
neither
of
us
then
even
dreamed
that
either
one
or
both
might
eventually
be
standing
in
this
place
that
i
now
stand
in
now
and
that
he
once
stood
in
before
me
it
may
well
be
that
one
of
the
freshmen
members
of
the
d
congress
one
of
you
out
there
will
deliver
his
own
state
of
the
union
message
years
from
now
in
the
year
well
whichever
one
it
is
i
want
you
to
be
able
to
look
back
with
pride
and
to
say
that
your
first
years
here
were
great
years
and
recall
that
you
were
here
in
this
d
congress
when
america
ended
its
longest
war
and
began
its
longest
peace
mr
speaker
and
mr
president
and
my
distinguished
colleagues
and
our
guests
i
would
like
to
add
a
personal
word
with
regard
to
an
issue
that
has
been
of
great
concern
to
all
americans
over
the
past
year
i
refer
of
course
to
the
investigations
of
the
socalled
watergate
affair
as
you
know
i
have
provided
to
the
special
prosecutor
voluntarily
a
great
deal
of
material
i
believe
that
i
have
provided
all
the
material
that
he
needs
to
conclude
his
investigations
and
to
proceed
to
prosecute
the
guilty
and
to
clear
the
innocent
i
believe
the
time
has
come
to
bring
that
investigation
and
the
other
investigations
of
this
matter
to
an
end
one
year
of
watergate
is
enough
and
the
time
has
come
my
colleagues
for
not
only
the
executive
the
president
but
the
members
of
congress
for
all
of
us
to
join
together
in
devoting
our
full
energies
to
these
great
issues
that
i
have
discussed
tonight
which
involve
the
welfare
of
all
of
the
american
people
in
so
many
different
ways
as
well
as
the
peace
of
the
world
i
recognize
that
the
house
judiciary
committee
has
a
special
responsibility
in
this
area
and
i
want
to
indicate
on
this
occasion
that
i
will
cooperate
with
the
judiciary
committee
in
its
investigation
i
will
cooperate
so
that
it
can
conclude
its
investigation
make
its
decision
and
i
will
cooperate
in
any
way
that
i
consider
consistent
with
my
responsibilities
to
the
office
of
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
there
is
only
one
limitation
i
will
follow
the
precedent
that
has
been
followed
by
and
defended
by
every
president
from
george
washington
to
lyndon
b
johnson
of
never
doing
anything
that
weakens
the
office
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
impairs
the
ability
of
the
presidents
of
the
future
to
make
the
great
decisions
that
are
so
essential
to
this
nation
and
the
world
another
point
i
should
like
to
make
very
briefly
like
every
member
of
the
house
and
senate
assembled
here
tonight
i
was
elected
to
the
office
that
i
hold
and
like
every
member
of
the
house
and
senate
when
i
was
elected
to
that
office
i
knew
that
i
was
elected
for
the
purpose
of
doing
a
job
and
doing
it
as
well
as
i
possibly
can
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
have
no
intention
whatever
of
ever
walking
away
from
the
job
that
the
people
elected
me
to
do
for
the
people
of
the
united
states
now
needless
to
say
it
would
be
understatement
if
i
were
not
to
admit
that
the
year
was
not
a
very
easy
year
for
me
personally
or
for
my
family
and
as
i
have
already
indicated
the
year
presents
very
great
and
serious
problems
as
very
great
and
serious
opportunities
are
also
presented
but
my
colleagues
this
i
believe
with
the
help
of
god
who
has
blessed
this
land
so
richly
with
the
cooperation
of
the
congress
and
with
the
support
of
the
american
people
we
can
and
we
will
make
the
year
a
year
of
unprecedented
progress
toward
our
goal
of
building
a
structure
of
lasting
peace
in
the
world
and
a
new
prosperity
without
war
in
the
united
states
of
america

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
traditional
form
of
the
presidents
annual
report
giving
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
is
a
single
message
or
address
as
the
affairs
and
concerns
of
our
union
have
multiplied
over
the
years
however
so
too
have
the
subjects
that
require
discussion
in
state
of
the
union
messages
this
year
in
particular
with
so
many
changes
in
government
programs
under
considerationand
with
our
very
philosophy
about
the
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
state
at
an
historic
crossroadsa
single
allembracing
state
of
the
union
message
would
not
appear
to
be
adequate
i
have
therefore
decided
to
present
my
state
of
the
union
report
in
the
form
of
a
series
of
messages
during
these
early
weeks
of
the
rd
congress
the
purpose
of
this
first
message
in
the
series
is
to
give
a
concise
overview
of
where
we
stand
as
a
people
today
and
to
outline
some
of
the
general
goals
that
i
believe
we
should
pursue
over
the
next
year
and
beyond
in
coming
weeks
i
will
send
to
the
congress
further
state
of
the
union
reports
on
specific
areas
of
policy
including
economic
affairs
natural
resources
human
resources
community
development
and
foreign
and
defense
policy
the
new
course
these
messages
will
outline
represents
a
fresh
approach
to
government
an
approach
that
addresses
the
realities
of
the
s
not
those
of
the
s
or
of
the
s
the
role
of
the
federal
government
as
we
approach
our
third
century
of
independence
should
not
be
to
dominate
any
facet
of
american
life
but
rather
to
aid
and
encourage
people
communities
and
institutions
to
deal
with
as
many
of
the
difficulties
and
challenges
facing
them
as
possible
and
to
help
see
to
it
that
every
american
has
a
full
and
equal
opportunity
to
realize
his
or
her
potential
if
we
were
to
continue
to
expand
the
federal
government
at
the
rate
of
the
past
several
decades
it
soon
would
consume
us
entirely
the
time
has
come
when
we
must
make
clear
choiceschoices
between
old
programs
that
set
worthy
goals
but
failed
to
reach
them
and
new
programs
that
provide
a
better
way
to
realize
those
goals
and
choices
too
between
competing
programsall
of
which
may
be
desirable
in
themselves
but
only
some
of
which
we
can
afford
with
the
finite
resources
at
our
command
because
our
resources
are
not
infinite
we
also
face
a
critical
choice
in
between
holding
the
line
in
government
spending
and
adopting
expensive
programs
which
will
surely
force
up
taxes
and
refuel
inflation
finally
it
is
vital
at
this
time
that
we
restore
a
greater
sense
of
responsibility
at
the
state
and
local
level
and
among
individual
americans
where
we
stand
the
basic
state
of
our
union
today
is
sound
and
full
of
promise
we
enter
economically
strong
militarily
secure
and
most
important
of
all
at
peace
after
a
long
and
trying
war
america
continues
to
provide
a
better
and
more
abundant
life
for
more
of
its
people
than
any
other
nation
in
the
world
we
have
passed
through
one
of
the
most
difficult
periods
in
our
history
without
surrendering
to
despair
and
without
dishonoring
our
ideals
as
a
people
looking
back
there
is
a
lesson
in
all
this
for
all
of
us
the
lesson
is
one
that
we
sometimes
had
to
learn
the
hard
way
over
the
past
few
years
but
we
did
learn
it
that
lesson
is
that
even
potentially
destructive
forces
can
be
converted
into
positive
forces
when
we
know
how
to
channel
them
and
when
we
use
common
sense
and
common
decency
to
create
a
climate
of
mutual
respect
and
goodwill
by
working
together
and
harnessing
the
forces
of
nature
americans
have
unlocked
some
of
the
great
mysteries
of
the
universe
men
have
walked
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
soared
to
new
heights
of
discovery
this
same
spirit
of
discovery
is
helping
us
to
conquer
disease
and
suffering
that
have
plagued
our
own
planet
since
the
dawn
of
time
by
working
together
with
the
leaders
of
other
nations
we
have
been
able
to
build
a
new
hope
for
lasting
peacefor
a
structure
of
world
order
in
which
common
interest
outweighs
old
animosities
and
in
which
a
new
generation
of
the
human
family
can
grow
up
at
peace
in
a
changing
world
at
home
we
have
learned
that
by
working
together
we
can
create
prosperity
without
fanning
inflation
we
can
restore
order
without
weakening
freedom
the
challenges
we
face
these
first
years
of
the
s
have
been
good
years
for
america
our
joball
of
us
togetheris
to
make
and
the
years
to
come
even
better
ones
i
believe
that
we
can
i
believe
that
we
can
make
the
years
leading
to
our
bicentennial
the
best
four
years
in
american
history
but
we
must
never
forget
that
nothing
worthwhile
can
be
achieved
without
the
will
to
succeed
and
the
strength
to
sacrifice
hard
decisions
must
be
made
and
we
must
stick
by
them
in
the
field
of
foreign
policy
we
must
remember
that
a
strong
americaan
america
whose
word
is
believed
and
whose
strength
is
respectedis
essential
to
continued
peace
and
understanding
in
the
world
the
peace
with
honor
we
have
achieved
in
vietnam
has
strengthened
this
basic
american
credibility
we
must
act
in
such
a
way
in
coming
years
that
this
credibility
will
remain
intact
and
with
it
the
world
stability
of
which
it
is
so
indispensable
a
part
at
home
we
must
reject
the
mistaken
notiona
notion
that
has
dominated
too
much
of
the
public
dialogue
for
too
longthat
ever
bigger
government
is
the
answer
to
every
problem
we
have
learned
only
too
well
that
heavy
taxation
and
excessive
government
spending
are
not
a
cureall
in
too
many
cases
instead
of
solving
the
problems
they
were
aimed
at
they
have
merely
placed
an
ever
heavier
burden
on
the
shoulders
of
the
american
taxpayer
in
the
form
of
higher
taxes
and
a
higher
cost
of
living
at
the
same
time
they
have
deceived
our
people
because
many
of
the
intended
beneficiaries
received
far
less
than
was
promised
thus
undermining
public
faith
in
the
effectiveness
of
government
as
a
whole
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
draw
the
line
the
time
has
come
for
the
responsible
leaders
of
both
political
parties
to
take
a
stand
against
overgrown
government
and
for
the
american
taxpayer
we
are
not
spending
the
federal
governments
money
we
are
spending
the
taxpayers
money
and
it
must
be
spent
in
a
way
which
guarantees
his
moneys
worth
and
yields
the
fullest
possible
benefit
to
the
people
being
helped
the
answer
to
many
of
the
domestic
problems
we
face
is
not
higher
taxes
and
more
spending
it
is
less
waste
more
results
and
greater
freedom
for
the
individual
american
to
earn
a
rightful
place
in
his
own
communityand
for
states
and
localities
to
address
their
own
needs
in
their
own
ways
in
the
light
of
their
own
priorities
by
giving
the
people
and
their
locally
elected
leaders
a
greater
voice
through
changes
such
as
revenue
sharing
and
by
saying
no
to
excessive
federal
spending
and
higher
taxes
we
can
help
achieve
this
goal
coming
messages
the
policies
which
i
will
outline
to
the
congress
in
the
weeks
ahead
represent
a
reaffirmation
not
an
abdication
of
federal
responsibility
they
represent
a
pragmatic
rededication
to
social
compassion
and
national
excellence
in
place
of
the
combination
of
good
intentions
and
fuzzy
followthrough
which
too
often
in
the
past
was
thought
sufficient
in
the
field
of
economic
affairs
our
objectives
will
be
to
hold
down
taxes
to
continue
controlling
inflation
to
promote
economic
growth
to
increase
productivity
to
encourage
foreign
trade
to
keep
farm
income
high
to
bolster
small
business
and
to
promote
better
labormanagement
relations
in
the
area
of
natural
resources
my
recommendations
will
include
programs
to
preserve
and
enhance
the
environment
to
advance
science
and
technology
and
to
assure
balanced
use
of
our
irreplaceable
natural
resources
in
developing
human
resources
i
will
have
recommendations
to
advance
the
nations
health
and
education
to
improve
conditions
of
people
in
need
to
carry
forward
our
increasingly
successful
attacks
on
crime
drug
abuse
and
injustice
and
to
deal
with
such
important
areas
of
special
concern
as
consumer
affairs
we
will
continue
and
improve
our
nations
efforts
to
assist
those
who
have
served
in
the
armed
services
in
vietnam
through
better
job
and
training
opportunities
we
must
do
a
better
job
in
community
developmentin
creating
more
livable
communities
in
which
all
of
our
children
can
grow
up
with
fuller
access
to
opportunity
and
greater
immunity
to
the
social
evils
and
blights
which
now
plague
so
many
of
our
towns
and
cities
i
shall
have
proposals
to
help
us
achieve
this
i
shall
also
deal
with
our
defense
and
foreign
policies
and
with
our
new
approaches
to
the
role
and
structure
of
government
itself
considered
as
a
whole
this
series
of
messages
will
be
a
blueprint
for
modernizing
the
concept
and
the
functions
of
american
government
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
people
converting
it
into
reality
will
require
a
spirit
of
cooperation
and
shared
commitment
on
the
part
of
all
branches
of
the
government
for
the
goals
we
seek
are
not
those
of
any
single
party
or
faction
they
are
goals
for
the
betterment
of
all
americans
as
president
i
recognize
that
i
cannot
do
this
job
alone
the
congress
must
help
and
i
pledge
to
do
my
part
to
achieve
a
constructive
working
relationship
with
the
congress
my
sincere
hope
is
that
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
can
work
together
in
this
great
undertaking
in
a
positive
spirit
of
mutual
respect
and
cooperation
working
togetherthe
congress
the
president
and
the
peoplei
am
confident
that
we
can
translate
these
proposals
into
an
action
program
that
can
reform
and
revitalize
american
government
and
even
more
important
build
a
better
life
for
all
americans
the
white
house
february

mr
speaker
mr
president
my
colleagues
in
the
congress
our
distinguished
guests
my
fellow
americans
twentyfive
years
ago
i
sat
here
as
a
freshman
congressmanalong
with
speaker
albertand
listened
for
the
first
time
to
the
president
address
the
state
of
the
union
i
shall
never
forget
that
moment
the
senate
the
diplomatic
corps
the
supreme
court
the
cabinet
entered
the
chamber
and
then
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
all
of
you
are
aware
i
had
some
differences
with
president
truman
he
had
some
with
me
but
i
remember
that
on
that
daythe
day
he
addressed
that
joint
session
of
the
newly
elected
republican
th
congress
he
spoke
not
as
a
partisan
but
as
president
of
all
the
peoplecalling
upon
the
congress
to
put
aside
partisan
considerations
in
the
national
interest
the
greekturkish
aid
program
the
marshall
plan
the
great
foreign
policy
initiatives
which
have
been
responsible
for
avoiding
a
world
war
for
over
years
were
approved
by
the
th
congress
by
a
bipartisan
majority
of
which
i
was
proud
to
be
a
part
nineteen
hundred
seventytwo
is
now
before
us
it
holds
precious
time
in
which
to
accomplish
good
for
the
nation
we
must
not
waste
it
i
know
the
political
pressures
in
this
session
of
the
congress
will
be
great
there
are
more
candidates
for
the
presidency
in
this
chamber
today
than
there
probably
have
been
at
any
one
time
in
the
whole
history
of
the
republic
and
there
is
an
honest
difference
of
opinion
not
only
between
the
parties
but
within
each
party
on
some
foreign
policy
issues
and
on
some
domestic
policy
issues
however
there
are
great
national
problems
that
are
so
vital
that
they
transcend
partisanship
so
let
us
have
our
debates
let
us
have
our
honest
differences
but
let
us
join
in
keeping
the
national
interest
first
let
us
join
in
making
sure
that
legislation
the
nation
needs
does
not
become
hostage
to
the
political
interests
of
any
party
or
any
person
there
is
ample
precedent
in
this
election
year
for
me
to
present
you
with
a
huge
list
of
new
proposals
knowing
full
well
that
there
would
not
be
any
possibility
of
your
passing
them
if
you
worked
night
and
day
i
shall
not
do
that
i
have
presented
to
the
leaders
of
the
congress
today
a
message
of
words
discussing
in
some
detail
where
the
nation
stands
and
setting
forth
specific
legislative
items
on
which
i
have
asked
the
congress
to
act
much
of
this
is
legislation
which
i
proposed
in
in
and
also
in
the
first
session
of
this
d
congress
and
on
which
i
feel
it
is
essential
that
action
be
completed
this
year
i
am
not
presenting
proposals
which
have
attractive
labels
but
no
hope
of
passage
i
am
presenting
only
vital
programs
which
are
within
the
capacity
of
this
congress
to
enact
within
the
capacity
of
the
budget
to
finance
and
which
i
believe
should
be
above
partisanshipprograms
which
deal
with
urgent
priorities
for
the
nation
which
should
and
must
be
the
subject
of
bipartisan
action
by
this
congress
in
the
interests
of
the
country
in
when
i
took
the
oath
of
office
on
the
steps
of
this
building
just
years
ago
today
the
nation
was
ending
one
of
the
most
tortured
decades
in
its
history
the
s
were
a
time
of
great
progress
in
many
areas
but
as
we
all
know
they
were
also
times
of
great
agonythe
agonies
of
war
of
inflation
of
rapidly
rising
crime
of
deteriorating
titles
of
hopes
raised
and
disappointed
and
of
anger
and
frustration
that
led
finally
to
violence
and
to
the
worst
civil
disorder
in
a
century
i
recall
these
troubles
not
to
point
any
fingers
of
blame
the
nation
was
so
torn
in
those
final
years
of
the
sixties
that
many
in
both
parties
questioned
whether
america
could
be
governed
at
all
the
nation
has
made
significant
progress
in
these
first
years
of
the
seventies
our
cities
are
no
longer
engulfed
by
civil
disorders
our
colleges
and
universities
have
again
become
places
of
learning
instead
of
battlegrounds
a
beginning
has
been
made
in
preserving
and
protecting
our
environment
the
rate
of
increase
in
crime
has
been
slowedand
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
one
city
where
the
federal
government
has
direct
jurisdiction
serious
crime
in
was
actually
reduced
by
percent
from
the
year
before
most
important
because
of
the
beginnings
that
have
been
made
we
can
say
today
that
this
year
can
be
the
year
in
which
america
may
make
the
greatest
progress
in
years
toward
achieving
our
goal
of
being
at
peace
with
all
the
nations
of
the
world
as
our
involvement
in
the
war
in
vietnam
comes
to
an
end
we
must
now
go
on
to
build
a
generation
of
peace
to
achieve
that
goal
we
must
first
face
realistically
the
need
to
maintain
our
defense
in
the
past
years
we
have
reduced
the
burden
of
arms
for
the
first
time
in
years
spending
on
defense
has
been
brought
below
spending
on
human
resources
as
we
look
to
the
future
we
find
encouraging
progress
in
our
negotiations
with
the
soviet
union
on
limitation
of
strategic
arms
and
looking
further
into
the
future
we
hope
there
can
eventually
be
agreement
on
the
mutual
reduction
of
arms
but
until
there
is
such
a
mutual
agreement
we
must
maintain
the
strength
necessary
to
deter
war
and
that
is
why
because
of
rising
research
and
development
costs
because
of
increases
in
military
and
civilian
pay
because
of
the
need
to
proceed
with
new
weapons
systems
my
budget
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
will
provide
for
an
increase
in
defense
spending
strong
military
defenses
are
not
the
enemy
of
peace
they
are
the
guardians
of
peace
there
could
be
no
more
misguided
set
of
priorities
than
one
which
would
tempt
others
by
weakening
america
and
thereby
endanger
the
peace
of
the
world
in
our
foreign
policy
we
have
entered
a
new
era
the
world
has
changed
greatly
in
the
years
since
president
john
kennedy
said
in
his
inaugural
address
we
shall
pay
any
price
bear
any
burden
meet
any
hardship
support
any
friend
oppose
any
foe
to
assure
the
survival
and
the
success
of
liberty
our
policy
has
been
carefully
and
deliberately
adjusted
to
meet
the
new
realities
of
the
new
world
we
live
in
we
make
today
only
those
commitments
we
are
able
and
prepared
to
meet
our
commitment
to
freedom
remains
strong
and
unshakable
but
others
must
bear
their
share
of
the
burden
of
defending
freedom
around
the
world
and
so
this
then
is
our
policy
we
will
maintain
a
nuclear
deterrent
adequate
to
meet
any
threat
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
or
of
our
allies
we
will
help
other
nations
develop
the
capability
of
defending
themselves
we
will
faithfully
honor
all
of
our
treaty
commitments
we
will
act
to
defend
our
interests
whenever
and
wherever
they
are
threatened
anyplace
in
the
world
but
where
our
interests
or
our
treaty
commitments
are
not
involved
our
role
will
be
limited
we
will
not
intervene
militarily
but
we
will
use
our
influence
to
prevent
war
if
war
comes
we
will
use
our
influence
to
stop
it
once
it
is
over
we
will
do
our
share
in
helping
to
bind
up
the
wounds
of
those
who
have
participated
in
it
as
you
know
i
will
soon
be
visiting
the
peoples
republic
of
china
and
the
soviet
union
i
go
there
with
no
illusions
we
have
great
differences
with
both
powers
we
shall
continue
to
have
great
differences
but
peace
depends
on
the
ability
of
great
powers
to
live
together
on
the
same
planet
despite
their
differences
we
would
not
be
true
to
our
obligation
to
generations
yet
unborn
if
we
failed
to
seize
this
moment
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
insure
that
we
will
be
able
to
talk
about
those
differences
rather
than
to
fight
about
them
in
the
future
as
we
look
back
over
this
century
let
us
in
the
highest
spirit
of
bipartisanship
recognize
that
we
can
be
proud
of
our
nations
record
in
foreign
affairs
america
has
given
more
generously
of
itself
toward
maintaining
freedom
preserving
peace
alleviating
human
suffering
around
the
globe
than
any
nation
has
ever
done
in
the
history
of
man
we
have
fought
four
wars
in
this
century
but
our
power
has
never
been
used
to
break
the
peace
only
to
keep
it
never
been
used
to
destroy
freedom
only
to
defend
it
we
now
have
within
our
reach
the
goal
of
insuring
that
the
next
generation
can
be
the
first
generation
in
this
century
to
be
spared
the
scourges
of
war
turning
to
our
problems
at
home
we
are
making
progress
toward
our
goal
of
a
new
prosperity
without
war
industrial
production
consumer
spending
retail
sales
personal
income
all
have
been
rising
total
employment
real
income
are
the
highest
in
history
new
home
building
starts
this
past
year
reached
the
highest
level
ever
business
and
consumer
confidence
have
both
been
rising
interest
rates
are
down
the
rate
of
inflation
is
down
we
can
look
with
confidence
to
as
the
year
when
the
back
of
inflation
will
be
broken
now
this
a
good
record
but
it
is
not
good
enoughnot
when
we
still
have
an
unemployment
rate
of
percent
it
is
not
enough
to
point
out
that
this
was
the
rate
of
the
early
peacetime
years
of
the
sixties
or
that
if
the
more
than
million
men
released
from
the
armed
forces
and
defenserelated
industries
were
still
in
their
wartime
jobs
unemployment
would
be
far
lower
our
goal
in
this
country
is
full
employment
in
peacetime
we
intend
to
meet
that
goal
and
we
can
the
congress
has
helped
to
meet
that
goal
by
passing
our
jobcreating
tax
program
last
month
the
historic
monetary
agreements
agreements
that
we
have
reached
with
the
major
european
nations
canada
and
japan
will
help
meet
it
by
providing
new
markets
for
american
products
new
jobs
for
american
workers
our
budget
will
help
meet
it
by
being
expansionary
without
being
inflationarya
jobproducing
budget
that
will
help
take
up
the
gap
as
the
economy
expands
to
full
employment
our
program
to
raise
farm
income
will
help
meet
it
by
helping
to
revitalize
rural
america
by
giving
to
americas
farmers
their
fair
share
of
americas
increasing
productivity
we
also
will
help
meet
our
goal
of
full
employment
in
peacetime
with
a
set
of
major
initiatives
to
stimulate
more
imaginative
use
of
americas
great
capacity
for
technological
advance
and
to
direct
it
toward
improving
the
quality
of
life
for
every
american
in
reaching
the
moon
we
demonstrated
what
miracles
american
technology
is
c
apable
of
achieving
now
the
time
has
come
to
move
more
deliberately
toward
making
full
use
of
that
technology
here
on
earth
of
harnessing
the
wonders
of
science
to
the
service
of
man
i
shall
soon
send
to
the
congress
a
special
message
proposing
a
new
program
of
federal
partnership
in
technological
research
and
developmentwith
federal
incentives
to
increase
private
research
federally
supported
research
on
projects
designed
to
improve
our
everyday
lives
in
ways
that
will
range
from
improving
mass
transit
to
developing
new
systems
of
emergency
health
care
that
could
save
thousands
of
lives
annually
historically
our
superior
technology
and
high
productivity
have
made
it
possible
for
american
workers
to
be
the
highest
paid
in
the
world
by
far
and
yet
for
our
goods
still
to
compete
in
world
markets
now
we
face
a
new
situation
as
other
nations
move
rapidly
forward
in
technology
the
answer
to
the
new
competition
is
not
to
build
a
wall
around
america
but
rather
to
remain
competitive
by
improving
our
own
technology
still
further
and
by
increasing
productivity
in
american
industry
our
new
monetary
and
trade
agreements
will
make
it
possible
for
american
goods
to
compete
fairly
in
the
worlds
marketsbut
they
still
must
compete
the
new
technology
program
will
put
to
use
the
skills
of
many
highly
trained
americans
skills
that
might
otherwise
be
wasted
it
will
also
meet
the
growing
technological
challenge
from
abroad
and
it
will
thus
help
to
create
new
industries
as
well
as
creating
more
jobs
for
americas
workers
in
producing
for
the
worlds
markets
this
second
session
of
the
d
congress
already
has
before
it
more
than
major
administration
proposals
which
still
await
action
i
have
discussed
these
in
the
extensive
written
message
that
i
have
presented
to
the
congress
today
they
include
among
others
our
programs
to
improve
life
for
the
aging
to
combat
crime
and
drug
abuse
to
improve
health
services
and
to
ensure
that
no
one
will
be
denied
needed
health
care
because
of
inability
to
pay
to
protect
workers
pension
rights
to
promote
equal
opportunity
for
members
of
minorities
and
others
who
have
been
left
behind
to
expand
consumer
protection
to
improve
the
environment
to
revitalize
rural
america
to
help
the
cities
to
launch
new
initiatives
in
education
to
improve
transportation
and
to
put
an
end
to
costly
labor
tieups
in
transportation
the
west
coast
dock
strike
is
a
case
in
point
this
nation
cannot
and
will
not
tolerate
that
kind
of
irresponsible
labor
tieup
in
the
future
the
messages
also
include
basic
reforms
which
are
essential
if
our
structure
of
government
is
to
be
adequate
in
the
decades
ahead
they
include
reform
of
our
wasteful
and
outmoded
welfare
systemsubstitution
of
a
new
system
that
provides
work
requirements
and
work
incentives
for
those
who
can
help
themselves
income
support
for
those
who
cannot
help
themselves
and
fairness
to
the
working
poor
they
include
a
billion
program
of
federal
revenue
sharing
with
the
states
and
localities
as
an
investment
in
their
renewal
an
investment
also
of
faith
in
the
american
people
they
also
include
a
sweeping
reorganization
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
so
that
it
will
be
more
efficient
more
responsive
and
able
to
meet
the
challenges
of
the
decades
ahead
one
year
ago
standing
in
this
place
i
laid
before
the
opening
session
of
this
congress
six
great
goals
one
of
these
was
welfare
reform
that
proposal
has
been
before
the
congress
now
for
nearly
years
my
proposals
on
revenue
sharing
government
reorganization
health
care
and
the
environment
have
now
been
before
the
congress
for
nearly
a
year
many
of
the
other
major
proposals
that
i
have
referred
to
have
been
here
that
long
or
longer
now
we
can
say
was
a
year
of
consideration
of
these
measures
now
let
us
join
in
making
a
year
of
action
on
them
action
by
the
congress
for
the
nation
and
for
the
people
of
america
now
in
addition
there
is
one
pressing
need
which
i
have
not
previously
covered
but
which
must
be
placed
on
the
national
agenda
we
long
have
looked
in
this
nation
to
the
local
property
tax
as
the
main
source
of
financing
for
public
primary
and
secondary
education
as
a
result
soaring
school
costs
soaring
property
tax
rates
now
threaten
both
our
communities
and
our
schools
they
threaten
communities
because
property
taxes
which
more
than
doubled
in
the
years
from
to
have
become
one
of
the
most
oppressive
and
discriminatory
of
all
taxes
hitting
most
cruelly
at
the
elderly
and
the
retired
and
they
threaten
schools
as
hardpressed
voters
understandably
reject
new
bond
issues
at
the
polls
the
problem
has
been
given
even
greater
urgency
by
four
recent
court
decisions
which
have
held
that
the
conventional
method
of
financing
schools
through
local
property
taxes
is
discriminatory
and
unconstitutional
nearly
years
ago
i
named
a
special
presidential
commission
to
study
the
problems
of
school
finance
and
i
also
directed
the
federal
departments
to
look
into
the
same
problems
we
are
developing
comprehensive
proposals
to
meet
these
problems
this
issue
involves
two
complex
and
interrelated
sets
of
problems
support
of
the
schools
and
the
basic
relationships
of
federal
state
and
local
governments
in
any
tax
reforms
under
the
leadership
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
we
are
carefully
reviewing
all
of
the
tax
aspects
and
i
have
this
week
enlisted
the
advisory
commission
on
intergovernmental
relations
in
addressing
the
intergovernmental
relations
aspects
i
have
asked
this
bipartisan
commission
to
review
our
proposals
for
federal
action
to
cope
with
the
gathering
crisis
of
school
finance
and
property
taxes
later
in
the
year
when
both
commissions
have
completed
their
studies
i
shall
make
my
final
recommendations
for
relieving
the
burden
of
property
taxes
and
providing
both
fair
and
adequate
financing
for
our
childrens
education
these
recommendations
will
be
revolutionary
but
all
these
recommendations
however
will
be
rooted
in
one
fundamental
principle
with
which
there
can
be
no
compromise
local
school
boards
must
have
control
over
local
schools
as
we
look
ahead
over
the
coming
decades
vast
new
growth
and
change
are
not
only
certainties
they
will
be
the
dominant
reality
of
this
world
and
particularly
of
our
life
in
america
surveying
the
certainty
of
rapid
change
we
can
be
like
a
fallen
rider
caught
in
the
stirrupsor
we
can
sit
high
in
the
saddle
the
masters
of
change
directing
it
on
a
course
we
choose
the
secret
of
mastering
change
in
todays
world
is
to
reach
back
to
old
and
proven
principles
and
to
adapt
them
with
imagination
and
intelligence
to
the
new
realities
of
a
new
age
that
is
what
we
have
done
in
the
proposals
that
i
have
laid
before
the
congress
they
are
rooted
in
basic
principles
that
are
as
enduring
as
human
nature
as
robust
as
the
american
experience
and
they
are
responsive
to
new
conditions
thus
they
represent
a
spirit
of
change
that
is
truly
renewal
as
we
look
back
at
those
old
principles
we
find
them
as
timely
as
they
are
timeless
we
believe
in
independence
and
selfreliance
and
the
creative
value
of
the
competitive
spirit
we
believe
in
full
and
equal
opportunity
for
all
americans
and
in
the
protection
of
individual
rights
and
liberties
we
believe
in
the
family
as
the
keystone
of
the
community
and
in
the
community
as
the
keystone
of
the
nation
we
believe
in
compassion
toward
those
in
need
we
believe
in
a
system
of
law
justice
and
order
as
the
basis
of
a
genuinely
free
society
we
believe
that
a
person
should
get
what
he
works
forand
that
those
who
can
should
work
for
what
they
get
we
believe
in
the
capacity
of
people
to
make
their
own
decisions
in
their
own
lives
in
their
own
communitiesand
we
believe
in
their
right
to
make
those
decisions
in
applying
these
principles
we
have
done
so
with
the
full
understanding
that
what
we
seek
in
the
seventies
what
our
quest
is
is
not
merely
for
more
but
for
better
for
a
better
quality
of
life
for
all
americans
thus
for
example
we
are
giving
a
new
measure
of
attention
to
cleaning
up
our
air
and
water
making
our
surroundings
more
attractive
we
are
providing
broader
support
for
the
arts
helping
stimulate
a
deeper
appreciation
of
what
they
can
contribute
to
the
nations
activities
and
to
our
individual
lives
but
nothing
really
matters
more
to
the
quality
of
our
lives
than
the
way
we
treat
one
another
than
our
capacity
to
live
respectfully
together
as
a
unified
society
with
a
full
generous
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
and
also
for
the
feelings
of
others
as
we
recover
from
the
turmoil
and
violence
of
recent
years
as
we
learn
once
again
to
speak
with
one
another
instead
of
shouting
at
one
another
we
are
regaining
that
capacity
as
is
customary
here
on
this
occasion
i
have
been
talking
about
programs
programs
are
important
but
even
more
important
than
programs
is
what
we
are
as
a
nationwhat
we
mean
as
a
nation
to
ourselves
and
to
the
world
in
new
york
harbor
stands
one
of
the
most
famous
statues
in
the
worldthe
statue
of
liberty
the
gift
in
of
the
people
of
france
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
this
statue
is
more
than
a
landmark
it
is
a
symbola
symbol
of
what
america
has
meant
to
the
world
it
reminds
us
that
what
america
has
meant
is
not
its
wealth
and
not
its
power
but
its
spirit
and
purposea
land
that
enshrines
liberty
and
opportunity
and
that
has
held
out
a
hand
of
welcome
to
millions
in
search
of
a
better
and
a
fuller
and
above
all
a
freer
life
the
worlds
hopes
poured
into
america
along
with
its
people
and
those
hopes
those
dreams
that
have
been
brought
here
from
every
corner
of
the
world
have
become
a
part
of
the
hope
that
we
now
hold
out
to
the
world
four
years
from
now
america
will
celebrate
the
th
anniversary
of
its
founding
as
a
nation
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
old
spirit
of
is
deadthat
we
no
longer
have
the
strength
of
character
the
idealism
the
faith
in
our
founding
purposes
that
that
spirit
represents
those
who
say
this
do
not
know
america
we
have
been
undergoing
selfdoubts
and
selfcriticism
but
these
are
only
the
other
side
of
our
growing
sensitivity
to
the
persistence

of
want
in
the
midst
of
plenty
of
our
impatience
with
the
slowness
with
which
ageold
ills
are
being
overcome
if
we
were
indifferent
to
the
shortcomings
of
our
society
or
complacent
about
our
institutions
or
blind
to
the
lingering
inequitiesthen
we
would
have
lost
our
way
but
the
fact
that
we
have
those
concerns
is
evidence
that
our
ideals
deep
down
are
still
strong
indeed
they
remind
us
that
what
is
really
best
about
america
is
its
compassion
they
remind
us
that
in
the
final
analysis
america
is
great
not
because
it
is
strong
not
because
it
is
rich
but
because
this
is
a
good
country
let
us
reject
the
narrow
visions
of
those
who
would
tell
us
that
we
are
evil
because
we
are
not
yet
perfect
that
we
are
corrupt
because
we
are
not
yet
pure
that
all
the
sweat
and
toil
and
sacrifice
that
have
gone
into
the
building
of
america
were
for
naught
because
the
building
is
not
yet
done
let
us
see
that
the
path
we
are
traveling
is
wide
with
room
in
it
for
all
of
us
and
that
its
direction
is
toward
a
better
nation
and
a
more
peaceful
world
never
has
it
mattered
more
that
we
go
forward
together
look
at
this
chamber
the
leadership
of
america
is
here
todaythe
supreme
court
the
cabinet
the
senate
the
house
of
representatives
together
we
hold
the
future
of
the
nation
and
the
conscience
of
the
nation
in
our
hands
because
this
year
is
an
election
year
it
will
be
a
time
of
great
pressure
if
we
yield
to
that
pressure
and
fail
to
deal
seriously
with
the
historic
challenges
that
we
face
we
will
have
failed
the
trust
of
millions
of
americans
and
shaken
the
confidence
they
have
a
right
to
place
in
us
in
their
government
never
has
a
congress
had
a
greater
opportunity
to
leave
a
legacy
of
a
profound
and
constructive
reform
for
the
nation
than
this
congress
if
we
succeed
in
these
tasks
there
will
be
credit
enough
for
allnot
only
for
doing
what
is
right
but
doing
it
in
the
right
way
by
rising
above
partisan
interest
to
serve
the
national
interest
and
if
we
fail
more
than
any
one
of
us
america
will
be
the
loser
that
is
why
my
call
upon
the
congress
today
is
for
a
high
statesmanship
so
that
in
the
years
to
come
americans
will
look
back
and
say
because
it
withstood
the
intense
pressures
of
a
political
year
and
achieved
such
great
good
for
the
american
people
and
for
the
future
of
this
nation
this
was
truly
a
great
congress

mr
speaker
mr
president
my
colleagues
in
the
congress
our
distinguished
guests
my
fellow
americans
as
this
d
congress
begins
its
session
america
has
lost
a
great
senator
and
all
of
us
who
had
the
privilege
to
know
him
have
lost
a
loyal
friend
i
had
the
privilege
of
visiting
senator
russell
in
the
hospital
just
a
few
days
before
he
died
he
never
spoke
about
himself
he
only
spoke
eloquently
about
the
need
for
a
strong
national
defense
in
tribute
to
one
of
the
most
magnificent
americans
of
all
time
i
respectfully
ask
that
all
those
here
will
rise
in
silent
prayer
for
senator
russell
thank
you
mr
speaker
before
i
begin
my
formal
address
i
want
to
use
this
opportunity
to
congratulate
all
of
those
who
were
winners
in
the
rather
spirited
contest
for
leadership
positions
in
the
house
and
the
senate
and
also
to
express
my
condolences
to
the
losers
i
know
how
both
of
you
feel
and
i
particularly
want
to
join
with
all
of
the
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate
as
well
in
congratulating
the
new
speaker
of
the
united
states
congress
to
those
new
members
of
this
house
who
may
have
some
doubts
about
the
possibilities
for
advancement
in
the
years
ahead
i
would
remind
you
that
the
speaker
and
i
met
just
years
ago
in
this
chamber
as
freshmen
members
of
the
th
congress
as
you
see
we
both
have
come
up
in
the
world
a
bit
since
then
mr
speaker
this
d
congress
has
a
chance
to
be
recorded
as
the
greatest
congress
in
americas
history
in
these
troubled
years
just
past
america
has
been
going
through
a
long
nightmare
of
war
and
division
of
crime
and
inflation
even
more
deeply
we
have
gone
through
a
long
dark
night
of
the
american
spirit
but
now
that
night
is
ending
now
we
must
let
our
spirits
soar
again
now
we
are
ready
for
the
lift
of
a
driving
dream
the
people
of
this
nation
are
eager
to
get
on
with
the
quest
for
new
greatness
they
see
challenges
and
they
are
prepared
to
meet
those
challenges
it
is
for
us
here
to
open
the
doors
that
will
set
free
again
the
real
greatness
of
this
nationthe
genius
of
the
american
people
how
shall
we
meet
this
challenge
how
can
we
truly
open
the
doors
and
set
free
the
full
genius
of
our
people
the
way
in
which
the
d
congress
answers
these
questions
will
determine
its
place
in
history
more
importantly
it
can
determine
this
nations
place
in
history
as
we
enter
the
third
century
of
our
independence
tonight
i
shall
present
to
the
congress
six
great
goals
i
shall
ask
not
simply
for
more
new
programs
in
the
old
framework
i
shall
ask
to
change
the
framework
of
government
itselfto
reform
the
entire
structure
of
american
government
so
we
can
make
it
again
fully
responsive
to
the
needs
and
the
wishes
of
the
american
people
if
we
act
boldlyif
we
seize
this
moment
and
achieve
these
goalswe
can
close
the
gap
between
promise
and
performance
in
american
government
we
can
bring
together
the
resources
of
this
nation
and
the
spirit
of
the
american
people
in
discussing
these
great
goals
i
shall
deal
tonight
only
with
matters
on
the
domestic
side
of
the
nations
agenda
i
shall
make
a
separate
report
to
the
congress
and
the
nation
next
month
on
developments
in
foreign
policy
the
first
of
these
great
goals
is
already
before
the
congress
i
urge
that
the
unfinished
business
of
the
st
congress
be
made
the
first
priority
business
of
the
d
congress
over
the
next
weeks
i
will
call
upon
congress
to
take
action
on
more
than
pieces
of
proposed
legislation
on
which
action
was
not
completed
last
year
the
most
important
is
welfare
reform
the
present
welfare
system
has
become
a
monstrous
consuming
outragean
outrage
against
the
community
against
the
taxpayer
and
particularly
against
the
children
it
is
supposed
to
help
we
may
honestly
disagree
as
we
do
on
what
to
do
about
it
but
we
can
all
agree
that
we
must
meet
the
challenge
not
by
pouring
more
money
into
a
bad
program
but
by
abolishing
the
present
welfare
system
and
adopting
a
new
one
so
let
us
place
a
floor
under
the
income
of
every
family
with
children
in
americaand
without
those
demeaning
soulstifling
affronts
to
human
dignity
that
so
blight
the
lives
of
welfare
children
today
but
let
us
also
establish
an
effective
work
incentive
and
an
effective
work
requirement
let
us
provide
the
means
by
which
more
can
help
themselves
this
shall
be
our
goal
let
us
generously
help
those
who
are
not
able
to
help
themselves
but
let
us
stop
helping
those
who
are
able
to
help
themselves
but
refuse
to
do
so
the
second
great
goal
is
to
achieve
what
americans
have
not
enjoyed
since
full
prosperity
in
peacetime
the
tide
of
inflation
has
turned
the
rise
in
the
cost
of
living
which
had
been
gathering
dangerous
momentum
in
the
late
sixties
was
reduced
last
year
inflation
will
be
further
reduced
this
year
but
as
we
have
moved
from
runaway
inflation
toward
reasonable
price
stability
and
at
the
same
time
as
we
have
been
moving
from
a
wartime
economy
to
a
peacetime
economy
we
have
paid
a
price
in
increased
unemployment
we
should
take
no
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
level
of
unemployment
in
this
transition
from
a
wartime
to
a
peacetime
economy
is
lower
than
in
any
peacetime
year
of
the
sixties
this
is
not
good
enough
for
the
man
who
is
unemployed
in
the
seventies
we
must
do
better
for
workers
in
peacetime
and
we
will
do
better
to
achieve
this
i
will
submit
an
expansionary
budget
this
yearone
that
will
help
stimulate
the
economy
and
thereby
open
up
new
job
opportunities
for
millions
of
americans
it
will
be
a
full
employment
budget
a
budget
designed
to
be
in
balance
if
the
economy
were
operating
at
its
peak
potential
by
spending
as
if
we
were
at
full
employment
we
will
help
to
bring
about
full
employment
i
ask
the
congress
to
accept
these
expansionary
policiesto
accept
the
concept
of
a
full
employment
budget
at
the
same
time
i
ask
the
congress
to
cooperate
in
resisting
expenditures
that
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
full
employment
budget
for
as
we
wage
a
campaign
to
bring
about
a
widely
shared
prosperity
we
must
not
reignite
the
fires
of
inflation
and
so
undermine
that
prosperity
with
the
stimulus
and
the
discipline
of
a
full
employment
budget
with
the
commitment
of
the
independent
federal
reserve
system
to
provide
fully
for
the
monetary
needs
of
a
growing
economy
and
with
a
much
greater
effort
on
the
part
of
labor
and
management
to
make
their
wage
and
price
decisions
in
the
light
of
the
national
interest
and
their
own
selfinterestthen
for
the
worker
the
farmer
the
consumer
for
americans
everywhere
we
shall
gain
the
goal
of
a
new
prosperity
more
jobs
more
income
more
profits
without
inflation
and
without
war
this
is
a
great
goal
and
one
that
we
can
achieve
together
the
third
great
goal
is
to
continue
the
effort
so
dramatically
begun
last
year
to
restore
and
enhance
our
natural
environment
building
on
the
foundation
laid
in
the
point
program
that
i
submitted
to
congress
last
year
i
will
propose
a
strong
new
set
of
initiatives
to
clean
up
our
air
and
water
to
combat
noise
and
to
preserve
and
restore
our
surroundings
i
will
propose
programs
to
make
better
use
of
our
land
to
encourage
a
balanced
national
growthgrowth
that
will
revitalize
our
rural
heartland
and
enhance
the
quality
of
life
in
america
and
not
only
to
meet
todays
needs
but
to
anticipate
those
of
tomorrow
i
will
put
forward
the
most
extensive
program
ever
proposed
by
a
president
of
the
united
states
to
expand
the
nations
parks
recreation
areas
open
spaces
in
a
way
that
truly
brings
parks
to
the
people
where
the
people
are
for
only
if
we
leave
a
legacy
of
parks
will
the
next
generation
have
parks
to
enjoy
as
a
fourth
great
goal
i
will
offer
a
farreaching
set
of
proposals
for
improving
americas
health
care
and
making
it
available
more
fairly
to
more
people
i
will
propose
a
program
to
insure
that
no
american
family
will
be
prevented
from
obtaining
basic
medical
care
by
inability
to
pay
i
will
propose
a
major
increase
in
and
redirection
of
aid
to
medical
schools
to
greatly
increase
the
number
of
doctors
and
other
health
personnel
incentives
to
improve
the
delivery
of
health
services
to
get
more
medical
care
resources
into
those
areas
that
have
not
been
adequately
served
to
make
greater
use
of
medical
assistants
and
to
slow
the
alarming
rise
in
the
costs
of
medical
care
new
programs
to
encourage
better
preventive
medicine
by
attacking
the
causes
of
disease
and
injury
and
by
providing
incentives
to
doctors
to
keep
people
well
rather
than
just
to
treat
them
when
they
are
sick
i
will
also
ask
for
an
appropriation
of
an
extra
million
to
launch
an
intensive
campaign
to
find
a
cure
for
cancer
and
i
will
ask
later
for
whatever
additional
funds
can
effectively
be
used
the
time
has
come
in
america
when
the
same
kind
of
concentrated
effort
that
split
the
atom
and
took
man
to
the
moon
should
be
turned
toward
conquering
this
dread
disease
let
us
make
a
total
national
commitment
to
achieve
this
goal
america
has
long
been
the
wealthiest
nation
in
the
world
now
it
is
time
we
became
the
healthiest
nation
in
the
world
the
fifth
great
goal
is
to
strengthen
and
to
renew
our
state
and
local
governments
as
we
approach
our
th
anniversary
in
we
remember
that
this
nation
launched
itself
as
a
loose
confederation
of
separate
states
without
a
workable
central
government
at
that
time
the
mark
of
its
leaders
vision
was
that
they
quickly
saw
the
need
to
balance
the
separate
powers
of
the
states
with
a
government
of
central
powers
and
so
they
gave
us
a
constitution
of
balanced
powers
of
unity
with
diversityand
so
clear
was
their
vision
that
it
survives
today
as
the
oldest
written
constitution
still
in
force
in
the
world
for
almost
two
centuries
sinceand
dramatically
in
the
sat
those
great
turning
points
when
the
question
has
been
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
that
question
has
been
resolved
in
favor
of
a
stronger
central
federal
government
during
this
time
the
nation
grew
and
the
nation
prospered
but
one
thing
history
tells
us
is
that
no
great
movement
goes
in
the
same
direction
forever
nations
change
they
adapt
or
they
slowly
die
the
time
has
now
come
in
america
to
reverse
the

flow
of
power
and
resources
from
the
states
and
communities
to
washington
and
start
power
and
resources
flowing
back
from
washington
to
the
states
and
communities
and
more
important
to
the
people
all
across
america
the
time
has
come
for
a
new
partnership
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
and
localitiesa
partnership
in
which
we
entrust
the
states
and
localities
with
a
larger
share
of
the
nations
responsibilities
and
in
which
we
share
our
federal
revenues
with
them
so
that
they
can
meet
those
responsibilities
to
achieve
this
goal
i
propose
to
the
congress
tonight
that
we
enact
a
plan
of
revenue
sharing
historic
in
scope
and
bold
in
concept
all
across
america
today
states
and
cities
are
confronted
with
a
financial
crisis
some
have
already
been
cutting
back
on
essential
servicesfor
example
just
recently
san
diego
and
cleveland
cut
back
on
trash
collections
most
are
caught
between
the
prospects
of
bankruptcy
on
the
one
hand
and
adding
to
an
already
crushing
tax
burden
on
the
other
as
one
indication
of
the
rising
costs
of
local
government
i
discovered
the
other
day
that
my
home
town
of
whittier
californiawhich
has
a
population
of
has
a
larger
budget
for
than
the
entire
federal
budget
was
in
now
the
time
has
come
to
take
a
new
direction
and
once
again
to
introduce
a
new
and
more
creative
balance
to
our
approach
to
government
so
let
us
put
the
money
where
the
needs
are
and
let
us
put
the
power
to
spend
it
where
the
people
are
i
propose
that
the
congress
make
a
billion
investment
in
renewing
state
and
local
government
five
billion
dollars
of
this
will
be
in
new
and
unrestricted
funds
to
be
used
as
the
states
and
localities
see
fit
the
other
billion
will
be
provided
by
allocating
billion
of
new
funds
and
converting
onethird
of
the
money
going
to
the
present
narrowpurpose
aid
programs
into
federal
revenue
sharing
funds
for
six
broad
purposesfor
urban
development
rural
development
education
transportation
job
training
and
law
enforcementbut
with
the
states
and
localities
making
their
own
decisions
on
how
it
should
be
spent
within
each
category
for
the
next
fiscal
year
this
would
increase
total
federal
aid
to
the
states
and
localities
more
than
percent
over
the
present
level
the
revenue
sharing
proposals
i
send
to
the
congress
will
include
the
safeguards
against
discrimination
that
accompany
all
other
federal
funds
allocated
to
the
states
neither
the
president
nor
the
congress
nor
the
conscience
of
this
nation
can
permit
money
which
comes
from
all
the
people
to
be
used
in
a
way
which
discriminates
against
some
of
the
people
the
federal
government
will
still
have
a
large
and
vital
role
to
play
in
achieving
our
national
progress
established
functions
that
are
clearly
and
essentially
federal
in
nature
will
still
be
performed
by
the
federal
government
new
functions
that
need
to
be
sponsored
or
performed
by
the
federal
governmentsuch
as
those
i
have
urged
tonight
in
welfare
and
healthwill
be
added
to
the
federal
agenda
whenever
it
makes
the
best
sense
for
us
to
act
as
a
whole
nation
the
federal
government
should
and
will
lead
the
way
but
where
states
or
local
governments
can
better
do
what
needs
to
be
done
let
us
see
that
they
have
the
resources
to
do
it
there
under
this
plan
the
federal
government
will
provide
the
states
and
localities
with
more
money
and
less
interferenceand
by
cutting
down
the
interference
the
same
amount
of
money
will
go
a
lot
further
let
us
share
our
resources
let
us
share
them
to
rescue
the
states
and
localities
from
the
brink
of
financial
crisis
let
us
share
them
to
give
homeowners
and
wage
earners
a
chance
to
escape
from
everhigher
property
taxes
and
sales
taxes
let
us
share
our
resources
for
two
other
reasons
as
well
the
first
of
these
reasons
has
to
do
with
government
itself
and
the
second
has
to
do
with
each
of
us
with
the
individual
lets
face
it
most
americans
today
are
simply
fed
up
with
government
at
all
levels
they
will
notand
they
should
notcontinue
to
tolerate
the
gap
between
promise
and
performance
in
government
the
fact
is
that
we
have
made
the
federal
government
so
strong
it
grows
musclebound
and
the
states
and
localities
so
weak
they
approach
impotence
if
we
put
more
power
in
more
places
we
can
make
government
more
creative
in
more
places
that
way
we
multiply
the
number
of
people
with
the
ability
to
make
things
happenand
we
can
open
the
way
to
a
new
burst
of
creative
energy
throughout
america
the
final
reason
i
urge
this
historic
shift
is
much
more
personal
for
each
and
for
every
one
of
us
as
everything
seems
to
have
grown
bigger
and
more
complex
in
america
as
the
forces
that
shape
our
lives
seem
to
have
grown
more
distant
and
more
impersonal
a
great
feeling
of
frustration
has
crept
across
this
land
whether
it
is
the
workingman
who
feels
neglected
the
black
man
who
feels
oppressed
or
the
mother
concerned
about
her
children
there
has
been
a
growing
feeling
that
things
are
in
the
saddle
and
ride
mankind
millions
of
frustrated
young
americans
today
are
crying
outasking
not
what
will
government
do
for
me
but
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
contribute
how
can
i
matter
and
so
let
us
answer
them
let
us
say
to
them
and
let
us
say
to
all
americans
we
hear
you
we
will
give
you
a
chance
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
new
chance
to
have
more
to
say
about
the
decisions
that
affect
your
futurea
chance
to
participate
in
governmentbecause
we
are
going
to
provide
more
centers
of
power
where
what
you
do
can
make
a
difference
that
you
can
see
and
feel
in
your
own
life
and
the
life
of
your
whole
community
the
further
away
government
is
from
people
the
stronger
government
becomes
and
the
weaker
people
become
and
a
nation
with
a
strong
government
and
a
weak
people
is
an
empty
shell
i
reject
the
patronizing
idea
that
government
in
washington
dc
is
inevitably
more
wise
more
honest
and
more
efficient
than
government
at
the
local
or
state
level
the
honesty
and
efficiency
of
government
depends
on
people
government
at
all
levels
has
good
people
and
bad
people
and
the
way
to
get
more
good
people
into
government
is
to
give
them
more
opportunity
to
do
good
things
the
idea
that
a
bureaucratic
elite
in
washington
knows
best
what
is
best
for
people
everywhere
and
that
you
cannot
trust
local
governments
is
really
a
contention
that
you
cannot
trust
people
to
govern
themselves
this
notion
is
completely
foreign
to
the
american
experience
local
government
is
the
government
closest
to
the
people
it
is
most
responsive
to
the
individual
person
it
is
peoples
government
in
a
far
more
intimate
way
than
the
government
in
washington
can
ever
be
people
came
to
america
because
they
wanted
to
determine
their
own
future
rather
than
to
live
in
a
country
where
others
determined
their
future
for
them
what
this
change
means
is
that
once
again
in
america
we
are
placing
our
trust
in
people
i
have
faith
in
people
i
trust
the
judgment
of
people
let
us
give
the
people
of
america
a
chance
a
bigger
voice
in
deciding
for
themselves
those
questions
that
so
greatly
affect
their
lives
the
sixth
great
goal
is
a
complete
reform
of
the
federal
government
itself
based
on
a
long
and
intensive
study
with
the
aid
of
the
best
advice
obtainable
i
have
concluded
that
a
sweeping
reorganization
of
the
executive
branch
is
needed
if
the
government
is
to
keep
up
with
the
times
and
with
the
needs
of
the
people
i
propose
therefore
that
we
reduce
the
present
cabinet
departments
to
eight
i
propose
that
the
departments
of
state
treasury
defense
and
justice
remain
but
that
all
the
other
departments
be
consolidated
into
four
human
resources
community
development
natural
resources
and
economic
development
let
us
look
at
what
these
would
be
first
a
department
dealing
with
the
concerns
of
peopleas
individuals
as
members
of
a
familya
department
focused
on
human
needs
second
a
department
concerned
with
the
communityrural
communities
and
urban
communitiesand
with
all
that
it
takes
to
make
a
community
function
as
a
community
third
a
department
concerned
with
our
physical
environment
with
the
preservation
and
balanced
use
of
those
great
natural
resources
on
which
our
nation
depends
and
fourth
a
department
concerned
with
our
prosperitywith
our
jobs
our
businesses
and
those
many
activities
that
keep
our
economy
running
smoothly
and
well
under
this
plan
rather
than
dividing
up
our
departments
by
narrow
subjects
we
would
organize
them
around
the
great
purposes
of
government
rather
than
scattering
responsibility
by
adding
new
levels
of
bureaucracy
we
would
focus
and
concentrate
the
responsibility
for
getting
problems
solved
with
these
four
departments
when
we
have
a
problem
we
will
know
where
to
goand
the
department
will
have
the
authority
and
the
resources
to
do
something
about
it
over
the
years
we
have
added
departments
and
created
agencies
at
the
federal
level
each
to
serve
a
new
constituency
to
handle
a
particular
taskand
these
have
grown
and
multiplied
in
what
has
become
a
hopeless
confusion
of
form
and
function
the
time
has
come
to
match
our
structure
to
our
purposesto
look
with
a
fresh
eye
to
organize
the
government
by
conscious
comprehensive
design
to
meet
the
new
needs
of
a
new
era
one
hundred
years
ago
abraham
lincoln
stood
on
a
battlefield
and
spoke
of
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
too
often
since
then
we
have
become
a
nation
of
the
government
by
the
government
for
the
government
by
enacting
these
reforms
we
can
renew
that
principle
that
lincoln
stated
so
simply
and
so
well
by
giving
everyones
voice
a
chance
to
be
heard
we
will
have
government
that
truly
is
of
the
people
by
creating
more
centers
of
meaningful
power
more
places
where
decisions
that
really
count
can
be
made
by
giving
more
people
a
chance
to
do
something
we
can
have
government
that
truly
is
by
the
people
and
by
setting
up
a
completely
modern
functional
system
of
government
at
the
national
level
we
in
washington
will
at
last
be
able
to
provide
government
that
is
truly
for
the
people
i
realize
that
what
i
am
asking
is
that
not
only
the
executive
branch
in
washington
but
that
even
this
con
gress
will
have
to
change
by
giving
up
some
of
its
power
change
is
hard
but
without
change
there
can
be
no
progress
and
for
each
of
us
the
question
then
becomes
not
will
change
cause
me
inconvenience
but
will
change
bring
progress
for
america
giving
up
power
is
hard
but
i
would
urge
all
of
you
as
leaders
of
this
country
to
remember
that
the
truly
revered
leaders
in
world
history
are
those
who
gave
power
to
people
and
not
those
who
took
it
away
as
we
consider
these
reforms
we
will
be
acting
not
for
the
next
years
or
for
the
next
years
but
for
the
next
years
so
let
us
approach
these
six
great
goals
with
a
sense
not
only
of
this
moment
in
history
but
also
of
history
itself
let
us
act
with
the
willingness
to
work
together
and
the
vision
and
the
boldness
and
the
courage
of
those
great
americans
who
met
in
philadelphia
almost
years
ago
to
write
a
constitution
let
us
leave
a
heritage
as
they
didnot
just
for
our
children
but
for
millions
yet
unbornof
a
nation
where
every
american
will
have
a
chance
not
only
to
live
in
peace
and
to
enjoy
prosperity
and
opportunity
but
to
participate
in
a
system
of
government
where
he
knows
not
only
his
votes
but
his
ideas
counta
system
of
government
which
will
provide
the
means
for
america
to
reach
heights
of
achievement
undreamed
of
before
those
men
who
met
at
philadelphia
left
a
great
heritage
because
they
had
a
visionnot
only
of
what
the
nation
was
but
of
what
it
could
become
as
i
think
of
that
vision
i
recall
that
america
was
founded
as
the
land
of
the
open
dooras
a
haven
for
the
oppressed
a
land
of
opportunity
a
place
of
refuge
of
hope
when
the
first
settlers
opened
the
door
of
america
three
and
a
half
centuries
ago
they
came
to
escape
persecution
and
to
find
opportunityand
they
left
wide
the
door
of
welcome
for
others
to
follow
when
the
thirteen
colonies
declared
their
independence
almost
two
centuries
ago
they
opened
the
door
to
a
new
vision
of
liberty
and
of
human
fulfillmentnot
just
for
an
elite
but
for
all
to
the
generations
that
followed
americas
was
the
open
door
that
beckoned
millions
from
the
old
world
to
the
new
in
search
of
a
better
life
a
freer
life
a
fuller
life
and
in
which
by
their
own
decisions
they
could
shape
their
own
destinies
for
the
black
american
the
indian
the
mexicanamerican
and
for
those
others
in
our
land
who
have
not
had
an
equal
chance
the
nation
at
last
has
begun
to
confront
the
need
to
press
open
the
door
of
full
and
equal
opportunity
and
of
human
dignity
for
all
americans
with
these
changes
i
have
proposed
tonight
we
can
open
the
door
to
a
new
era
of
opportunity
we
can
open
the
door
to
full
and
effective
participation
in
the
decisions
that
affect
their
lives
we
can
open
the
door
to
a
new
partnership
among
governments
at
all
levels
between
those
governments
and
the
people
themselves
and
by
so
doing
we
can
open
wide
the
doors
of
human
fulfillment
for
millions
of
people
here
in
america
now
and
in
the
years
to
come
in
the
next
few
weeks
i
will
spell
out
in
greater
detail
the
way
i
propose
that
we
achieve
these
six
great
goals
i
ask
this
congress
to
be
responsive
if
it
is
then
the
d
congress
your
congress
our
congress
at
the
end
of
its
term
will
be
able
to
look
back
on
a
record
more
splendid
than
any
in
our
history
this
can
be
the
congress
that
helped
us
end
the
longest
war
in
the
nations
history
and
end
it
in
a
way
that
will
give
us
at
last
a
genuine
chance
to
enjoy
what
we
have
not
had
in
this
century
a
full
generation
of
peace
this
can
be
the
congress
that
helped
achieve
an
expanding
economy
with
full
employment
and
without
inflationand
without
the
deadly
stimulus
of
war
this
can
be
the
congress
that
reformed
a
welfare
system
that
has
robbed
recipients
of
their
dignity
and
robbed
states
and
cities
of
their
resources
this
can
be
the
congress
that
pressed
forward
the
rescue
of
our
environment
and
established
for
the
next
generation
an
enduring
legacy
of
parks
for
the
people
this
can
be
the
congress
that
launched
a
new
era
in
american
medicine
in
which
the
quality
of
medical
care
was
enhanced
while
the
costs
were
made
less
burdensome
but
above
all
what
this
congress
can
be
remembered
for
is
opening
the
way
to
a
new
american
revolutiona
peaceful
revolution
in
which
power
was
turned
back
to
the
peoplein
which
government
at
all
levels
was
refreshed
and
renewed
and
made
truly
responsive
this
can
be
a
revolution
as
profound
as
farreaching
as
exciting
as
that
first
revolution
almost
years
agoand
it
can
mean
that
just
years
from
now
america
will
enter
its
third
century
as
a
young
nation
new
in
spirit
with
all
the
vigor
and
the
freshness
with
which
it
began
its
first
century
my
colleagues
in
the
congress
these
are
great
goals
they
can
make
the
sessions
of
this
congress
a
great
moment
for
america
so
let
us
pledge
together
to
go
forward
togetherby
achieving
these
goals
to
give
america
the
foundation
today
for
a
new
greatness
tomorrow
and
in
all
the
years
to
come
and
in
so
doing
to
make
this
the
greatest
congress
in
the
history
of
this
great
and
good
country

mr
speaker
mr
president
my
colleagues
in
the
congress
our
distinguished
guests
and
my
fellow
americans
to
address
a
joint
session
of
the
congress
in
this
great
chamber
in
which
i
was
once
privileged
to
serve
is
an
honor
for
which
i
am
deeply
grateful
the
state
of
the
union
address
is
traditionally
an
occasion
for
a
lengthy
and
detailed
account
by
the
president
of
what
he
has
accomplished
in
the
past
what
he
wants
the
congress
to
do
in
the
future
and
in
an
election
year
to
lay
the
basis
for
the
political
issues
which
might
be
decisive
in
the
fall
occasionally
there
comes
a
time
when
profound
and
farreaching
events
command
a
break
with
tradition
this
is
such
a
time
i
say
this
not
only
because
marks
the
beginning
of
a
new
decade
in
which
america
will
celebrate
its
th
birthday
i
say
it
because
new
knowledge
and
hard
experience
argue
persuasively
that
both
our
programs
and
our
institutions
in
america
need
to
be
reformed
the
moment
has
arrived
to
harness
the
vast
energies
and
abundance
of
this
land
to
the
creation
of
a
new
american
experience
an
experience
richer
and
deeper
and
more
truly
a
reflection
of
the
goodness
and
grace
of
the
human
spirit
the
seventies
will
be
a
time
of
new
beginnings
a
time
of
exploring
both
on
the
earth
and
in
the
heavens
a
time
of
discovery
but
the
time
has
also
come
for
emphasis
on
developing
better
ways
of
managing
what
we
have
and
of
completing
what
mans
genius
has
begun
but
left
unfinished
our
land
this
land
that
is
ours
together
is
a
great
and
a
good
land
it
is
also
an
unfinished
land
and
the
challenge
of
perfecting
it
is
the
summons
of
the
seventies
it
is
in
that
spirit
that
i
address
myself
to
those
great
issues
facing
our
nation
which
are
above
partisanship
when
we
speak
of
americas
priorities
the
first
priority
must
always
be
peace
for
america
and
the
world
the
major
immediate
goal
of
our
foreign
policy
is
to
bring
an
end
to
the
war
in
vietnam
in
a
way
that
our
generation
will
be
remembered
not
so
much
as
the
generation
that
suffered
in
war
but
more
for
the
fact
that
we
had
the
courage
and
character
to
win
the
kind
of
a
just
peace
that
the
next
generation
was
able
to
keep
we
are
making
progress
toward
that
goal
the
prospects
for
peace
are
far
greater
today
than
they
were
a
year
ago
a
major
part
of
the
credit
for
this
development
goes
to
the
members
of
this
congress
who
despite
their
differences
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
have
overwhelmingly
indicated
their
support
of
a
just
peace
by
this
action
you
have
completely
demolished
the
enemys
hopes
that
they
can
gain
in
washington
the
victory
our
fighting
men
have
denied
them
in
vietnam
no
goal
could
be
greater
than
to
make
the
next
generation
the
first
in
this
century
in
which
america
was
at
peace
with
every
nation
in
the
world
i
shall
discuss
in
detail
the
new
concepts
and
programs
designed
to
achieve
this
goal
in
a
separate
report
on
foreign
policy
which
i
shall
submit
to
the
congress
at
a
later
date
today
let
me
describe
the
directions
of
our
new
policies
we
have
based
our
policies
on
an
evaluation
of
the
world
as
it
is
not
as
it
was
years
ago
at
the
conclusion
of
world
war
ii
many
of
the
policies
which
were
necessary
and
right
then
are
obsolete
today
then
because
of
americas
overwhelming
military
and
economic
strength
because
of
the
weakness
of
other
major
free
world
powers
and
the
inability
of
scores
of
newly
independent
nations
to
defend
or
even
govern
themselves
america
had
to
assume
the
major
burden
for
the
defense
of
freedom
in
the
world
in
two
wars
first
in
korea
and
now
in
vietnam
we
furnished
most
of
the
money
most
of
the
arms
most
of
the
men
to
help
other
nations
defend
their
freedom
today
the
great
industrial
nations
of
europe
as
well
as
japan
have
regained
their
economic
strength
and
the
nations
of
latin
americaand
many
of
the
nations
who
acquired
their
freedom
from
colonialism
after
world
war
ii
in
asia
and
africahave
a
new
sense
of
pride
and
dignity
and
a
determination
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
their
own
defense
that
is
the
basis
of
the
doctrine
i
announced
at
guam
neither
the
defense
nor
the
development
of
other
nations
can
be
exclusively
or
primarily
an
american
undertaking
the
nations
of
each
part
of
the
world
should
assume
the
primary
responsibility
for
their
own
wellbeing
and
they
themselves
should
determine
the
terms
of
that
wellbeing
we
shall
be
faithful
to
our
treaty
commitments
but
we
shall
reduce
our
involvement
and
our
presence
in
other
nations
affairs
to
insist
that
other
nations
play
a
role
is
not
a
retreat
from
responsibility
it
is
a
sharing
of
responsibility
the
result
of
this
new
policy
has
been
not
to
weaken
our
alliances
but
to
give
them
new
life
new
strength
a
new
sense
of
common
purpose
relations
with
our
european
allies
are
once
again
strong
and
healthy
based
on
mutual
consultation
and
mutual
responsibility
we
have
initiated
a
new
approach
to
latin
america
in
which
we
deal
with
those
nations
as
partners
rather
than
patrons
the
new
partnership
concept
has
been
welcomed
in
asia
we
have
developed
an
historic
new
basis
for
japaneseamerican
friendship
and
cooperation
which
is
the
linchpin
for
peace
in
the
pacific
if
we
are
to
have
peace
in
the
last
third
of
the
century
a
major
factor
will
be
the
development
of
a
new
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
i
would
not
underestimate
our
differences
but
we
are
moving
with
precision
and
purpose
from
an
era
of
confrontation
to
an
era
of
negotiation
our
negotiations
on
strategic
arms
limitations
and
in
other
areas
will
have
far
greater
chance
for
success
if
both
sides
enter
them
motivated
by
mutual
selfinterest
rather
than
naive
sentimentality
it
is
with
this
same
spirit
that
we
have
resumed
discussions
with
communist
china
in
our
talks
at
warsaw
our
concern
in
our
relations
with
both
these
nations
is
to
avoid
a
catastrophic
collision
and
to
build
a
solid
basis
for
peaceful
settlement
of
our
differences
i
would
be
the
last
to
suggest
that
the
road
to
peace
is
not
difficult
and
dangerous
but
i
believe
our
new
policies
have
contributed
to
the
prospect
that
america
may
have
the
best
chance
since
world
war
ii
to
enjoy
a
generation
of
uninterrupted
peace
and
that
chance
will
be
enormously
increased
if
we
continue
to
have
a
relationship
between
congress
and
the
executive
in
which
despite
differences
in
detail
where
the
security
of
america
and
the
peace
of
mankind
are
concerned
we
act
not
as
republicans
not
as
democrats
but
as
americans
as
we
move
into
the
decade
of
the
seventies
we
have
the
greatest
opportunity
for
progress
at
home
of
any
people
in
world
history
our
gross
national
product
will
increase
by
billion
in
the
next
years
this
increase
alone
is
greater
than
the
entire
growth
of
the
american
economy
from
to
the
critical
question
is
not
whether
we
will
grow
but
how
we
will
use
that
growth
the
decade
of
the
sixties
was
also
a
period
of
great
growth
economically
but
in
that
same
year
period
we
witnessed
the
greatest
growth
of
crime
the
greatest
increase
in
inflation
the
greatest
social
unrest
in
america
in
years
never
has
a
nation
seemed
to
have
had
more
and
enjoyed
it
less
at
heart
the
issue
is
the
effectiveness
of
government
ours
has
becomeas
it
continues
to
be
and
should
remaina
society
of
large
expectations
government
helped
to
generate
these
expectations
it
undertook
to
meet
them
yet
increasingly
it
proved
unable
to
do
so
as
a
people
we
had
too
many
visionsand
too
little
vision
now
as
we
enter
the
seventies
we
should
enter
also
a
great
age
of
reform
of
the
institutions
of
american
government
our
purpose
in
this
period
should
not
be
simply
better
management
of
the
programs
of
the
past
the
time
has
come
for
a
new
questa
quest
not
for
a
greater
quantity
of
what
we
have
but
for
a
new
quality
of
life
in
america
a
major
part
of
the
substance
for
an
unprecedented
advance
in
this
nations
approach
to
its
problems
and
opportunities
is
contained
in
more
than
two
score
legislative
proposals
which
i
sent
to
the
congress
last
year
and
which
still
await
enactment
i
will
offer
at
least
a
dozen
more
major
programs
in
the
course
of
this
session
at
this
point
i
do
not
intend
to
go
through
a
detailed
listing
of
what
i
have
proposed
or
will
propose
but
i
would
like
to
mention
three
areas
in
which
urgent
priorities
demand
that
we
move
and
move
now
first
we
cannot
delay
longer
in
accomplishing
a
total
reform
of
our
welfare
system
when
a
system
penalizes
work
breaks
up
homes
robs
recipients
of
dignity
there
is
no
alternative
to
abolishing
that
system
and
adopting
in
its
place
the
program
of
income
support
job
training
and
work
incentives
which
i
recommended
to
the
congress
last
year
second
the
time
has
come
to
assess
and
reform
all
of
our
institutions
of
government
at
the
federal
state
and
local
level
it
is
time
for
a
new
federalism
in
which
after
years
of
power
flowing
from
the
people
and
local
and
state
governments
to
washington
dc
it
will
begin
to
flow
from
washington
back
to
the
states
and
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
third
we
must
adopt
reforms
which
will
expand
the
range
of
opportunities
for
all
americans
we
can
fulfill
the
american
dream
only
when
each
person
has
a
fair
chance
to
fulfill
his
own
dreams
this
means
equal
voting
rights
equal
employment
opportunity
and
new
opportunities
for
expanded
ownership
because
in
order
to
be
secure
in
their
human
rights
people
need
access
to
property
rights
i
could
give
similar
examples
of
the
need
for
reform
in
our
programs
for
health
education
housing
transportation
as
well
as
other
critical
areas
which
directly
affect
the
wellbeing
of
millions
of
americans
the
people
of
the
united
states
should
wait
no
longer
for
these
reforms
that
would
so
deeply
enhance
the
quality
of
their
life
when
i
speak
of
actions
which
would
be
beneficial
to
the
american
people
i
can
think
of
none
more
important
than
for
the
congress
to
join
this
administration
in
the
battle
to
stop
the
rise
in
the
cost
of
living
now
i
realize
it
is
tempting
to
blame
someone
else
for
inflation
some
blame
business
for
raising
prices
some
blam
e
unions
for
asking
for
more
wages
but
a
review
of
the
stark
fiscal
facts
of
the
s
clearly
demonstrates
where
the
primary
blame
for
rising
prices
must
be
placed
in
the
decade
of
the
sixties
the
federal
government
spent
billion
more
than
it
took
in
in
taxes
in
that
same
decade
the
american
people
paid
the
bill
for
that
deficit
in
price
increases
which
raised
the
cost
of
living
for
the
average
family
of
four
by
per
month
in
america
now
millions
of
americans
are
forced
to
go
into
debt
today
because
the
federal
government
decided
to
go
into
debt
yesterday
we
must
balance
our
federal
budget
so
that
american
families
will
have
a
better
chance
to
balance
their
family
budgets
only
with
the
cooperation
of
the
congress
can
we
meet
this
highest
priority
objective
of
responsible
government
we
are
on
the
right
track
we
had
a
balanced
budget
in
this
administration
cut
more
than
billion
out
of
spending
plans
in
order
to
produce
a
surplus
in
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
congress
reduced
revenues
by
billion
i
shall
recommend
a
balanced
budget
for
but
i
can
assure
you
that
not
only
to
present
but
to
stay
within
a
balanced
budget
requires
some
very
hard
decisions
it
means
rejecting
spending
programs
which
would
benefit
some
of
the
people
when
their
net
effect
would
result
in
price
increases
for
all
the
people
it
is
time
to
quit
putting
good
money
into
bad
programs
otherwise
we
will
end
up
with
bad
money
and
bad
programs
i
recognize
the
political
popularity
of
spending
programs
and
particularly
in
an
election
year
but
unless
we
stop
the
rise
in
prices
the
cost
of
living
for
millions
of
american
families
will
become
unbearable
and
governments
ability
to
plan
programs
for
progress
for
the
future
will
become
impossible
in
referring
to
budget
cuts
there
is
one
area
where
i
have
ordered
an
increase
rather
than
a
cutand
that
is
the
requests
of
those
agencies
with
the
responsibilities
for
law
enforcement
we
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
overblown
rhetoric
during
the
sixties
in
which
the
word
war
has
perhaps
too
often
been
usedthe
war
on
poverty
the
war
on
misery
the
war
on
disease
the
war
on
hunger
but
if
there
is
one
area
where
the
word
war
is
appropriate
it
is
in
the
fight
against
crime
we
must
declare
and
win
the
war
against
the
criminal
elements
which
increasingly
threaten
our
cities
our
homes
and
our
lives
we
have
a
tragic
example
of
this
problem
in
the
nations
capital
for
whose
safety
the
congress
and
the
executive
have
the
primary
responsibility
i
doubt
if
many
members
of
this
congress
who
live
more
than
a
few
blocks
from
here
would
dare
leave
their
cars
in
the
capitol
garage
and
walk
home
alone
tonight
last
year
this
administration
sent
to
the
congress
separate
pieces
of
legislation
dealing
with
organized
crime
pornography
street
crime
narcotics
crime
in
the
district
of
columbia
none
of
these
bills
has
reached
my
desk
for
signature
i
am
confident
that
the
congress
will
act
now
to
adopt
the
legislation
i
placed
before
you
last
year
we
in
the
executive
have
done
everything
we
can
under
existing
law
but
new
and
stronger
weapons
are
needed
in
that
fight
while
it
is
true
that
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
are
the
cutting
edge
in
the
effort
to
eliminate
street
crime
burglaries
murder
my
proposals
to
you
have
embodied
my
belief
that
the
federal
government
should
play
a
greater
role
in
working
in
partnership
with
these
agencies
that
is
why
federal
spending
for
local
law
enforcement
will
double
that
budgeted
for
the
primary
responsibility
for
crimes
that
affect
individuals
is
with
local
and
state
rather
than
with
federal
government
but
in
the
field
of
organized
crime
narcotics
pornography
the
federal
government
has
a
special
responsibility
it
should
fulfill
and
we
should
make
washington
dc
where
we
have
the
primary
responsibility
an
example
to
the
nation
and
the
world
of
respect
for
law
rather
than
lawlessness
i
now
turn
to
a
subject
which
next
to
our
desire
for
peace
may
well
become
the
major
concern
of
the
american
people
in
the
decade
of
the
seventies
in
the
next
years
we
shall
increase
our
wealth
by
percent
the
profound
question
is
does
this
mean
we
will
be
percent
richer
in
a
real
sense
percent
better
off
percent
happier
or
does
it
mean
that
in
the
year
the
president
standing
in
this
place
will
look
back
on
a
decade
in
which
percent
of
our
people
lived
in
metropolitan
areas
choked
by
traffic
suffocated
by
smog
poisoned
by
water
deafened
by
noise
and
terrorized
by
crime
these
are
not
the
great
questions
that
concern
world
leaders
at
summit
conferences
but
people
do
not
live
at
the
summit
they
live
in
the
foothills
of
everyday
experience
and
it
is
time
for
all
of
us
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
way
real
people
live
in
real
life
the
great
question
of
the
seventies
is
shall
we
surrender
to
our
surroundings
or
shall
we
make
our
peace
with
nature
and
begin
to
make
reparations
for
the
damage
we
have
done
to
our
air
to
our
land
and
to
our
water
restoring
nature
to
its
natural
state
is
a
cause
beyond
party
and
beyond
factions
it
has
become
a
common
cause
of
all
the
people
of
this
country
it
is
a
cause
of
particular
concern
to
young
americans
because
they
more
than
we
will
reap
the
grim
consequences
of
our
failure
to
act
on
programs
which
are
needed
now
if
we
are
to
prevent
disaster
later
clean
air
clean
water
open
spacesthese
should
once
again
be
the
birthright
of
every
american
if
we
act
now
they
can
be
we
still
think
of
air
as
free
but
clean
air
is
not
free
and
neither
is
clean
water
the
price
tag
on
pollution
control
is
high
through
our
years
of
past
carelessness
we
incurred
a
debt
to
nature
and
now
that
debt
is
being
called
the
program
i
shall
propose
to
congress
will
be
the
most
comprehensive
and
costly
program
in
this
field
in
americas
history
it
is
not
a
program
for
just
one
year
a
years
plan
in
this
field
is
no
plan
at
all
this
is
a
time
to
look
ahead
not
a
year
but
years
or
yearswhatever
time
is
required
to
do
the
job
i
shall
propose
to
this
congress
a
billion
nationwide
clean
waters
program
to
put
modern
municipal
waste
treatment
plants
in
every
place
in
america
where
they
are
needed
to
make
our
waters
clean
again
and
do
it
now
we
have
the
industrial
capacity
if
we
begin
now
to
build
them
all
within
years
this
program
will
get
them
built
within
years
as
our
cities
and
suburbs
relentlessly
expand
those
priceless
open
spaces
needed
for
recreation
areas
accessible
to
their
people
are
swallowed
upoften
forever
unless
we
preserve
these
spaces
while
they
are
still
available
we
will
have
none
to
preserve
therefore
i
shall
propose
new
financing
methods
for
purchasing
open
space
and
parklands
now
before
they
are
lost
to
us
the
automobile
is
our
worst
polluter
of
the
air
adequate
control
requires
further
advances
in
engine
design
and
fuel
composition
we
shall
intensify
our
research
set
increasingly
strict
standards
and
strengthen
enforcement
proceduresand
we
shall
do
it
now
we
can
no
longer
afford
to
consider
air
and
water
common
property
free
to
be
abused
by
anyone
without
regard
to
the
consequences
instead
we
should
begin
now
to
treat
them
as
scarce
resources
which
we
are
no
more
free
to
contaminate
than
we
are
free
to
throw
garbage
into
our
neighbors
yard
this
requires
comprehensive
new
regulations
it
also
requires
that
to
the
extent
possible
the
price
of
goods
should
be
made
to
include
the
costs
of
producing
and
disposing
of
them
without
damage
to
the
environment
now
i
realize
that
the
argument
is
often
made
that
there
is
a
fundamental
contradiction
between
economic
growth
and
the
quality
of
life
so
that
to
have
one
we
must
forsake
the
other
the
answer
is
not
to
abandon
growth
but
to
redirect
it
for
example
we
should
turn
toward
ending
congestion
and
eliminating
smog
the
same
reservoir
of
inventive
genius
that
created
them
in
the
first
place
continued
vigorous
economic
growth
provides
us
with
the
means
to
enrich
life
itself
and
to
enhance
our
planet
as
a
place
hospitable
to
man
each
individual
must
enlist
in
this
fight
if
it
is
to
be
won
it
has
been
said
that
no
matter
how
many
national
parks
and
historical
monuments
we
buy
and
develop
the
truly
significant
environment
for
each
of
us
is
that
in
which
we
spend
percent
of
our
timein
our
homes
in
our
places
of
work
the
streets
over
which
we
travel
street
litter
rundown
parking
strips
and
yards
dilapidated
fences
broken
windows
smoking
automobiles
dingy
working
places
all
should
be
the
object
of
our
fresh
view
we
have
been
too
tolerant
of
our
surroundings
and
too
willing
to
leave
it
to
others
to
clean
up
our
environment
it
is
time
for
those
who
make
massive
demands
on
society
to
make
some
minimal
demands
on
themselves
each
of
us
must
resolve
that
each
day
he
will
leave
his
home
his
property
the
public
places
of
the
city
or
town
a
little
cleaner
a
little
better
a
little
more
pleasant
for
himself
and
those
around
him
with
the
help
of
people
we
can
do
anything
and
without
their
help
we
can
do
nothing
in
this
spirit
together
we
can
reclaim
our
land
for
ours
and
generations
to
come
between
now
and
the
year
over
million
children
will
be
born
in
the
united
states
where
they
grow
upand
howwill
more
than
any
one
thing
measure
the
quality
of
american
life
in
these
years
ahead
this
should
be
a
warning
to
us
for
the
past
years
our
population
has
also
been
growing
and
shifting
the
result
is
exemplified
in
the
vast
areas
of
rural
america
emptying
out
of
people
and
of
promisea
third
of
our
counties
lost
population
in
the
sixties
the
violent
and
decayed
central
cities
of
our
great
metropolitan
complexes
are
the
most
conspicuous
area
of
failure
in
american
life
today
i
propose
that
before
these
problems
become
insoluble
the
nation
develop
a
national
growth
policy
in
the
future
government
decisions
as
to
where
to
build
highways
locate
airports
acquire
land
or
sell
land
should
be
made
with
a
clear
objective
of
aiding
a
balanced
growth
for
america
in
particular
the
federal
government
must
be
in
a
position
to
assist
in
the
building
of
new
cities
and
the
rebuilding
of
old
ones
at
the
same
time
we
will

carry
our
concern
with
the
quality
of
life
in
america
to
the
farm
as
well
as
the
suburb
to
the
village
as
well
as
to
the
city
what
rural
america
needs
most
is
a
new
kind
of
assistance
it
needs
to
be
dealt
with
not
as
a
separate
nation
but
as
part
of
an
overall
growth
policy
for
america
we
must
create
a
new
rural
environment
which
will
not
only
stem
the
migration
to
urban
centers
but
reverse
it
if
we
seize
our
growth
as
a
challenge
we
can
make
the
s
an
historic
period
when
by
conscious
choice
we
transformed
our
land
into
what
we
want
it
to
become
america
which
has
pioneered
in
the
new
abundance
and
in
the
new
technology
is
called
upon
today
to
pioneer
in
meeting
the
concerns
which
have
followed
in
their
wakein
turning
the
wonders
of
science
to
the
service
of
man
in
the
majesty
of
this
great
chamber
we
hear
the
echoes
of
americas
history
of
debates
that
rocked
the
union
and
those
that
repaired
it
of
the
summons
to
war
and
the
search
for
peace
of
the
uniting
of
the
people
the
building
of
a
nation
those
echoes
of
history
remind
us
of
our
roots
and
our
strengths
they
remind
us
also
of
that
special
genius
of
american
democracy
which
at
one
critical
turning
point
after
another
has
led
us
to
spot
the
new
road
to
the
future
and
given
us
the
wisdom
and
the
courage
to
take
it
as
i
look
down
that
new
road
which
i
have
tried
to
map
out
today
i
see
a
new
america
as
we
celebrate
our
th
anniversary
years
from
now
i
see
an
america
in
which
we
have
abolished
hunger
provided
the
means
for
every
family
in
the
nation
to
obtain
a
minimum
income
made
enormous
progress
in
providing
better
housing
faster
transportation
improved
health
and
superior
education
i
see
an
america
in
which
we
have
checked
inflation
and
waged
a
winning
war
against
crime
i
see
an
america
in
which
we
have
made
great
strides
in
stopping
the
pollution
of
our
air
cleaning
up
our
water
opening
up
our
parks
continuing
to
explore
in
space
most
important
i
see
an
america
at
peace
with
all
the
nations
of
the
world
this
is
not
an
impossible
dream
these
goals
are
all
within
our
reach
in
times
past
our
forefathers
had
the
vision
but
not
the
means
to
achieve
such
goals
let
it
not
be
recorded
that
we
were
the
first
american
generation
that
had
the
means
but
not
the
vision
to
make
this
dream
come
true
but
let
us
above
all
recognize
a
fundamental
truth
we
can
be
the
best
clothed
best
fed
best
housed
people
in
the
world
enjoying
clean
air
clean
water
beautiful
parks
but
we
could
still
be
the
unhappiest
people
in
the
world
without
an
indefinable
spiritthe
lift
of
a
driving
dream
which
has
made
america
from
its
beginning
the
hope
of
the
world
two
hundred
years
ago
this
was
a
new
nation
of
million
people
weak
militarily
poor
economically
but
america
meant
something
to
the
world
then
which
could
not
be
measured
in
dollars
something
far
more
important
than
military
might
listen
to
president
thomas
jefferson
in
we
act
not
for
ourselves
alone
but
for
the
whole
human
race
we
had
a
spiritual
quality
then
which
caught
the
imagination
of
millions
of
people
in
the
world
today
when
we
are
the
richest
and
strongest
nation
in
the
world
let
it
not
be
recorded
that
we
lack
the
moral
and
spiritual
idealism
which
made
us
the
hope
of
the
world
at
the
time
of
our
birth
the
demands
of
us
in
are
even
greater
than
in
it
is
no
longer
enough
to
live
and
let
live
now
we
must
live
and
help
live
we
need
a
fresh
climate
in
america
one
in
which
a
person
can
breathe
freely
and
breathe
in
freedom
our
recognition
of
the
truth
that
wealth
and
happiness
are
not
the
same
thing
requires
us
to
measure
success
or
failure
by
new
criteria
even
more
than
the
programs
i
have
described
today
what
this
nation
needs
is
an
example
from
its
elected
leaders
in
providing
the
spiritual
and
moral
leadership
which
no
programs
for
material
progress
can
satisfy
above
all
let
us
inspire
young
americans
with
a
sense
of
excitement
a
sense
of
destiny
a
sense
of
involvement
in
meeting
the
challenges
we
face
in
this
great
period
of
our
history
only
then
are
they
going
to
have
any
sense
of
satisfaction
in
their
lives
the
greatest
privilege
an
individual
can
have
is
to
serve
in
a
cause
bigger
than
himself
we
have
such
a
cause
how
we
seize
the
opportunities
i
have
described
today
will
determine
not
only
our
future
but
the
future
of
peace
and
freedom
in
this
world
in
the
last
third
of
the
century
may
god
give
us
the
wisdom
the
strength
and
above
all
the
idealism
to
be
worthy
of
that
challenge
so
that
america
can
fulfill
its
destiny
of
being
the
worlds
best
hope
for
liberty
for
opportunity
for
progress
and
peace
for
all
peoples

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
once
again
it
is
my
constitutional
duty
to
assess
the
state
of
the
union
on
each
such
previous
occasion
during
these
past
eight
years
i
have
outlined
a
forward
course
designed
to
achieve
our
mutual
objectivea
better
america
in
a
world
of
peace
this
time
my
function
is
different
the
american
people
in
free
election
have
selected
new
leadership
which
soon
will
be
entrusted
with
the
management
of
our
government
a
new
president
shortly
will
lay
before
you
his
proposals
to
shape
the
future
of
our
great
land
to
him
every
citizen
whatever
his
political
beliefs
prayerfully
extends
best
wishes
for
good
health
and
for
wisdom
and
success
in
coping
with
the
problems
that
confront
our
nation
for
my
part
i
should
like
first
to
express
to
you
of
the
congress
my
appreciation
of
your
devotion
to
the
common
good
and
your
friendship
over
these
difficult
years
i
will
carry
with
me
pleasant
memories
of
this
association
in
endeavors
profoundly
significant
to
all
our
people
we
have
been
through
a
lengthy
period
in
which
the
control
over
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
government
has
been
divided
between
our
two
great
political
parties
differences
of
course
we
have
had
particularly
in
domestic
affairs
but
in
a
united
determination
to
keep
this
nation
strong
and
free
and
to
utilize
our
vast
resources
for
the
advancement
of
all
mankind
we
have
carried
america
to
unprecedented
heights
for
this
cooperative
achievement
i
thank
the
american
people
and
those
in
the
congress
of
both
parties
who
have
supported
programs
in
the
interest
of
our
country
i
should
also
like
to
give
special
thanks
for
the
devoted
service
of
my
associates
in
the
executive
branch
and
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
career
employees
who
have
implemented
our
diverse
government
programs
my
second
purpose
is
to
review
briefly
the
record
of
these
past
eight
years
in
the
hope
that
out
of
the
sum
of
these
experiences
lessons
will
emerge
that
are
useful
to
our
nation
supporting
this
review
are
detailed
reports
from
the
several
agencies
and
departments
all
of
which
are
now
or
will
shortly
be
available
to
the
congress
throughout
the
world
the
years
since
have
been
a
period
of
profound
change
the
human
problems
in
the
world
grow
more
acute
hour
by
hour
yet
new
gains
in
science
and
technology
continually
extend
the
promise
of
a
better
life
people
yearn
to
be
free
to
govern
themselves
yet
a
third
of
the
people
of
the
world
have
no
freedom
do
not
govern
themselves
the
world
recognizes
the
catastrophic
nature
of
nuclear
war
yet
it
sees
the
wondrous
potential
of
nuclear
peace
during
the
period
the
united
states
has
forged
ahead
under
a
constructive
foreign
policy
the
continuing
goal
is
peace
liberty
and
wellbeingfor
others
as
well
as
ourselves
the
aspirations
of
all
peoples
are
onepeace
with
justice
in
freedom
peace
can
only
be
attained
collectively
as
peoples
everywhere
unite
in
their
determination
that
liberty
and
wellbeing
come
to
all
mankind
yet
while
we
have
worked
to
advance
national
aspirations
for
freedom
a
divisive
force
has
been
at
work
to
divert
that
aspiration
into
dangerous
channels
the
communist
movement
throughout
the
world
exploits
the
natural
striving
of
all
to
be
free
and
attempts
to
subjugate
men
rather
than
free
them
these
activities
have
caused
and
are
continuing
to
cause
grave
troubles
in
the
world
here
at
home
these
have
been
times
for
careful
adjustment
of
our
economy
from
the
artificial
impetus
of
a
hot
war
to
constructive
growth
in
a
precarious
peace
while
building
a
new
economic
vitality
without
inflation
we
have
also
increased
public
expenditures
to
keep
abreast
of
the
needs
of
a
growing
population
and
its
attendant
new
problems
as
well
as
our
added
international
responsibilities
we
have
worked
toward
these
ends
in
a
context
of
shared
responsibilityconscious
of
the
need
for
maximum
scope
to
private
effort
and
for
state
and
local
as
well
as
federal
governmental
action
success
in
designing
and
executing
national
purposes
domestically
and
abroad
can
only
come
from
a
steadfast
resolution
that
integrity
in
the
operation
of
government
and
in
our
relations
with
each
other
be
fully
maintained
only
in
this
way
could
our
spiritual
goals
be
fully
advanced
foreign
policy
on
january
when
i
took

despite

discord
our
government
responded
to
the
request
of
the
friendly
lebanese
government
for
military
help
and
promptly
withdrew
american
forces
as
soon
as
the
situation
was
stabilized
in
our
support
of
the
republic
of
china
during
the

restrained
the

chinese
from
attempting

although
unhappily
communist
penetration
of

is
real
and
poses
a
serious
threat
communist

have
been
deposed
in

advances
have
been
made
in
building
mutual

arrangementswhich
lie
at
the
heart
of
our
hopes
for
future
peace
and
security
in
the

the

has
been
established
the

and
a
mutual

in
addition
the
cento

we
have
participated
closely
in
its
deliberations
the

to
the
united

led
to
the
creation
of
the
international

our
policy
has
been
to
push
for
enforceable
programs
of
inspection
against
surprise
attack
suspension
of
nuclear
testing
arms
reduction
and
peaceful
use
of
outer
space
the
united

has
been
vigorously
supported
in
all
of
its
actions
including
the
condemnations
of
the
wholesale
murder
of
the
people
of
tibet
by
the
chinese
communists
and
the
brutal
soviet
repression
of
the
people
of
hungary
as
well
as
the
more
recent
un
actions
in
the
congo
the
united

took
the
initiative
in
negotiating
the
significant
treaty
to
guarantee
the
peaceful
use
of

antarctica
the
united

information
agency
has
been
transformed
into
a
greatly
improved
medium
for
explaining
our
policies
and
actions
to
audiences
overseas
answering
the
lies
of
communist
propaganda
and
projecting
a
clearer
image
of
american
life
and
culture
cultural
technological
and
educational
exchanges
with
the
soviet
union
have
been
encouraged
and
a
comprehensive
agreement
was
made
which
authorized
among
other
things
the
distribution
of
our
russian
language
magazine
amerika
and
the
highly
successful
american
exhibition
in
moscow
this
country
has
continued
to
withhold
recognition
of
communist
china
and
to
oppose
vigorously
the
admission
of
this
belligerent
and
unrepentant
nation
into
the
united
nations
red
china
has
yet
to
demonstrate
that
it
deserves
to
be
considered
a
peaceloving
nation
with
communist
imperialism
held
in

constructive
actions
were
undertaken
to
strengthen
the

go
on
new
tactics

have
to
be

the
underlying
principles
should
be
constant
our
great
moral
and
material
commitments
to
collective
security
deterrence
of
force
international
law
negotiations
that
lead
to
selfenforcing

and
the

the
cornerstone
of
a
foreign
policy
that
will
ultimately
bring
permanent
peace
with
justice
in
freedom
to
all
mankind
the
continuing
need
of
all
free

today
is
for
each
to
recognize
clearly
the
essentiality
of
an
unbreakable

shortened
in
order
to
meet
the
demands
of
modern
warfare
these
major
reorganizations
have
provided
a
more
effective
structure
for
unified
planning
and
direction
of
the
vast
defense
establishment
gradual
improvements
in
its
structure
and
procedures
are
to
be
expected
united
states
civil
defense
and
nonmilitary
defense
capacity
has
been
greatly
strengthened
and
these
activities
have
been
consolidated
in
one
federal
agency
the
defense
forces
of
our
allies
now
number
five
million
men
several
thousand
combatant
ships
and
over

programs
to
strengthen
these

have
been
consistently
supported
by
the
administration
us
military
assistance
goes
almost
exclusively
to
friendly
nations
on
the
rim
of
the
communist
world
this
american
contribution
to
nations
who
have
the
will
to
defend
their
freedom
but
insufficient
means
should
be
vigorously
continued
combined
with
our
allies
the
free
world
now
has
a
far
stronger
shield
than
we
could
provide
alone
since
our
defense
policy
has
been
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
international
situation
would
require
heavy
defense
expenditures
for
an
indefinite
period
to
come
probably
for
years
in
this
protracted
struggle
good
management
dictates
that
we
resist
overspending
as
resolutely
as
we
oppose
underspending
every
dollar
uselessly
spent
on
military
mechanisms
decreases
our
total
strength
and
therefore
our
security
we
must
not
return
to
the
crashprogram
psychology
of
the
past
when
each
new
feint
by
the
communists
was
responded
to
in
panic
the
bomber
gap
of
several
years
ago
was
always
a
fiction
and
the
missile
gap
shows
every
sign
of
being
the
same
the
nation
can
ill
afford
to
abandon
a
national
policy
which
provides
for
a
fully
adequate
and
steady
level
of
effort
designed
for
the
long
pull
a
fast
adjustment
to
new
scientific
and
technological
advances
a
balanced
force
of
such
strength
as
to
deter
general
war
to
effectively
meet
local
situations
and
to
retaliate
to
attack
and
destroy
the
attacker
and
a
strengthened
system
of
free
world
collective
security
the
economy
the
expanding
american
economy
passed
the
halftrillion
dollar
mark
in
gross
national
product
early
in
the
nations
output
of
goods
and
services
is
now
nearly
percent
higher
than
in
in
the
average
american
family
had
an
income
of

higher
in

of
constant
buying
power
than
in
and
the
real
wages
of
american
factory
workers
have
risen
percent
during
the

eight

these
facts
reflect
the
rising
standard
of

wellbeing
enjoyed
by
americans
our

benefits
also
from
a
remarkable
improvement
in

through

time
lost
since
because
of

has
been
half
that
lost
in
the
eight

prior
to
that
date
legislation
now
requires
that
union
members
have
the
opportunity
for
full
participation
in
the
affairs
of
their
unions
the
administration
supported
the
landrumgriffin
act
which
i
believe
is
greatly
helpful
to
the
vast
bulk
of
american
labor
and
its
leaders
and
also
is
a
major
step
in
getting
racketeers
and

out
of

affairs
the
economic
security
of
working
men
and

has
been
strengthened
by
an

have
been

a
national
construction
safety
program
has
been
developed
a
major
factor
in
strengthening
our
competitive
enterprise
system
and
promoting
economic
growth
has
been
the
vigorous
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws
over
the
last
eight
years
and
a
continuing
effort
to
reduce
artificial
restraints
on
competition
and
trade
and
enhance
our
economic
liberties
this
purpose
was
also
significantly
advanced
in
when
as
one
of
the
first
acts
of
this
administration
restrictive
wage
and
price
controls
were
ended
an
additional
measure
to
strengthen
the
american
system
of
competitive

was
the
creation
of
the
small

administration
in
to
assist
existing
small

and
encourage
new
ones
this
agency
has
approved
over
billion
in

initiated
a
new
program
to
provide
longterm
capital
for
small
businesses
aided
in
setting
aside
billion
in
government
contracts
for
award
to
small

concerns
and
brought
to
the
attention
of
individual
businessmen
through
programs
of

new
developments
in

have
included
also
a

for
expanding

a

has
been
made
to

a

launched
in
inaugurating

and
broadening
research

programs
to
awaken

these
actions
and

have
helped

to
a
level
of

although
intermittent
declines
in

persist
as
a
problem
in

recent

have
been
moderate

of

there
is
however
little
room
for
complacency
currently
our

is
operating
at

chronic

persist
clearly
continued
sound

shared
economic

remains
a
major
national
objective
toward
which
we
must
strive
through

if

to
assure
every

the

all

ceased

the

amounting

this

has
directed

have
been
sought
when
the

was
advancing
and
a
rigorous
evaluation
of

has
been
maintained
at

resort
to

in

could
easily
erode

and
contribute

at

in
this
belief
i
shall
submit
a

for

to
the
congress
next
week
there
has
been
a
firm
policy
of
reducing

competition
with

this
has
resulted
in
the
discontinuance
of
some
commercial
industrial
installations
and
in
addition
the
curtailment
of
approximately
industrial
installations
operated
directly
by

also
an
aggressive
surplus
disposal
program
has
been
carried
on
to

this
has
resulted
in
the
addition

a
substantial
number
of
valuable

to
local

rolls
and
a
significant
monetary
return
to

earnest
and
persistent
attempts
have
been
made

thereby
to

yet
in
certain
aspects
our

situation
is
increasingly
grave
for

our

now
total

if
we

we

have
all
we

all
we
could
sell

all
we
could
give
away
and
still
have
a
substantial
carryover
extraordinary
costs
are
involved
just
in
management
and
disposal
of
this
burdensome
surplus
obviously
important
adjustments
must
still
come
congress
must
enact
additional
legislation
to
permit
wheat
and
other
farm
commodities
to
move
into
regular
marketing
channels
in
an
orderly
manner
and
at
the

time
afford
the
needed

protection
to
the

only
then
will
agriculture
again
be

the
national

education
act
of
is
already
a
milestone
in
the
history
of
american
education
it
provides
broad
opportunities
for
the
intellectual
development
of
all
children
by
strengthening
courses
of
study
in
science
mathematics
and
foreign
languages
by
developing
new
graduate
programs
to
train
additional
teachers
and
by
providing
loans
for
young
people
who
need
financial
help
to
go
to

the

proposed
on
numerous
occasions
a
broad
new
fiveyear
program
of
federal
aid
to
help
overcome
the
classroom
shortage
in
public
elementary
and
secondary
schools
recommendations
were
also
made
to
give
assistance
to
colleges
and
universities
for
the
construction
of
academic

residential
buildings
to
meet
future

increases
this

greatly
expanded
federal
loans
for
building

training
a

assisting
in
the

there
has
been
a
vigorous
acceleration
of

programs
designed
to
advance
the

indian
in

last
fall
for
example
percent
of
the

children
between
the
ages
of

were
enrolled
in

this
is
a
rise
of
percent
since
in
the
field
of
science
and

startling
strides
have
been
made
by
the
new
national
aeronautics

administration
in
little
more
than
two
years
nasa
has
successfully
launched
meteorological
satellites
such
as
tiros
i
and
tiros

that
promise
to
revolutionize
methods
of
weather
forecasting
demonstrated
the
feasibility
of
satellites
for
global
communications
by
the
successful
launching
of
echo
i
produced
an
enormous
amount
of
valuable
scientific

such
as
the
discovery

successfully
launched
deepspace
probes
that
maintained
communication
over
the
greatest
range
man
has
ever
tracked
and
made
real
progress
toward
the
goal
of
manned
space
flights
these
achievements
unquestionably
make
us
preeminent
today
in
space
exploration
for
the
betterment
of
mankind
i
believe
the
present
organizational
arrangements
in
this
area
with
the
revisions
proposed
last
year
are
completely
adequate
for
the
tasks
ahead
americans
can
look
forward
to
new
achievements
in
space
exploration
the
near
future
will
hold
such
wonders
as
the
orbital
flight
of
an
astronaut
the
landing
of

on
the

the
launching
of
the
powerful
giant
saturn
rocket
vehicles

this

conclusion
in
concluding
my
final
message
to
the
congress
it
is
fitting
to
look
back
to
my
firstto
the
aims
and
ideals
i
set
forth
on
february
to
use
americas
influence
in
world
affairs
to
advance
the
cause
of
peace
and
justice
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
executive
branch
with
integrity
and
efficiency
to
encourage
creative
initiative
in
our
economy
and
to
work
toward
the
attainment
of
the
wellbeing
and
equality
of
opportunity
of
all
citizens
equally
we
have
honored
our
commitment
to
pursue
and
attain
specific
objectives
among
them
as
stated
eight
years
ago
strengthening
of
the
mutual
security
program
development
of
world
trade
and
commerce
ending
of
hostilities
in
korea
creation
of
a
powerful
deterrent
force
practicing
fiscal
responsibility
checking
the
menace
of
inflation
reducing
the
tax
burden
providing
an
effective
internal
security
program
developing
and
conserving
our
natural
resources
reducing
governmental
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
farmer
strengthening
and
improving
services
by
the
department
of
labor
and
the
vigilant
guarding
of
civil
and
social
fights
i
do
not
close
this
message
implying
that
all
is
wellthat
all
problems
are
solved
for
progress
implies
both
new
and
continuing
problems
and
unlike
presidential
administrations
problems
rarely
have
terminal
dates
abroad
there
is
the
continuing
communist
threat
to
the
freedom
of
berlin
an
explosive
situation
in
laos
the
problems
caused
by
communist
penetration
of
cuba
as
well
as
the
many
problems
connected
with
the
development
of
the
new
nations
in
africa
these
areas
in
particular
call
for
delicate
handling
and
constant
review
at
home
several
conspicuous
problems
remain
promoting
higher
levels
of
employment
with
special
emphasis
on
areas
in
which
heavy
unemployment
has
persisted
continuing
to
provide
for
steady
economic
growth
and
preserving
a
sound
currency
bringing
our
balance
of
payments
into
more
reasonable
equilibrium
and
continuing
a
high
level
of
confidence
in
our
national
and
international
systems
eliminating
heavily
excessive
surpluses
of
a
few
farm
commodities
and
overcoming
deficiencies
in
our
health
and
educational
programs
our
goal
always
has
been
to
add
to
the
spiritual
moral
and
material
strength
of
our
nation
i
believe
we
have
done
this
but
it
is
a
process
that
must
never
end
let
us
pray
that
leaders
of
both
the
near
and
distant
future
will
be
able
to
keep
the
nation
strong
and
at
peace
that
they
will
advance
the
wellbeing
of
all
our
people
that
they
will
lead
us
on
to
still
higher
moral
standards
and
that
in
achieving
these
goals
they
will
maintain
a
reasonable
balance
between
private
and
governmental
responsibility

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
th
congress
seven
years
ago
i
entered
my
present
office
with
one
longheld
resolve
overriding
all
others
i
was
then
and
remain
now
determined
that
the
united
states
shall
become
an
ever
more
potent
resource
for
the
cause
of
peacerealizing
that
peace
cannot
be
for
ourselves
alone
but
for
peoples
everywhere
this
determination
is
shared
by
the
entire
congressindeed
by
all
americans
my
purpose
today
is
to
discuss
some
features
of
americas
position
both
at
home
and
in
her
relations
to
others
first
i
point
out
that
for
us
annual
selfexamination
is
made
a
definite
necessity
by
the
fact
that
we
now
live
in
a
divided
world
of
uneasy
equilibrium
with
our
side
committed
to
its
own
protection
and
against
aggression
by
the
other
with
both
sides
of
this
divided
world
in
possession
of
unbelievably
destructive
weapons
mankind
approaches
a
state
where
mutual
annihilation
becomes
a
possibility
no
other
fact
of
todays
world
equals
this
in
importanceit
colors
everything
we
say
plan
and
do
there
is
demanded
of
us
vigilance
determination
and
the
dedication
of
whatever
portion
of
our
resources
that
will
provide
adequate
security
especially
a
real
deterrent
to
aggression
these
things
we
are
doing
all
these
facts
emphasize
the
importance
of
striving
incessantly
for
a
just
peace
only
through
the
strengthening
of
the
spiritual
intellectual
economic
and
defensive
resources
of
the
free
world
can
we
in
confidence
make
progress
toward
this
goal
second
we
note
that
recent
soviet
deportment
and
pronouncements
suggest
the
possible
opening
of
a
somewhat
less
strained
period
in
the
relationships
between
the
soviet
union
and
the
free
world
if
these
pronouncements
be
genuine
there
is
brighter
hope
of
diminishing
the
intensity
of
past
rivalry
and
eventually
of
substituting
persuasion
for
coercion
whether
this
is
to
become
an
era
of
lasting
promise
remains
to
be
tested
by
actions
third
we
now
stand
in
the
vestibule
of
a
vast
new
technological
ageone
that
despite
its
capacity
for
human
destruction
has
an
equal
capacity
to
make
poverty
and
human
misery
obsolete
if
our
efforts
are
wisely
directedand
if
our
unremitting
efforts
for
dependable
peace
begin
to
attain
some
successwe
can
surely
become
participants
in
creating
an
age
characterized
by
justice
and
rising
levels
of
human
wellbeing
over
the
past
year
the
soviet
union
has
expressed
an
interest
in
measures
to
reduce
the
common
peril
of
war
while
neither
we
nor
any
other
free
world
nation
can
permit
ourselves
to
be
misled
by
pleasant
promises
until
they
are
tested
by
performance
yet
we
approach
this
apparently
new
opportunity
with
the
utmost
seriousness
we
must
strive
to
break
the
calamitous
cycle
of
frustrations
and
crises
which
if
unchecked
could
spiral
into
nuclear
disaster
the
ultimate
insanity
though
the
need
for
dependable
agreements
to
assure
against
resort
to
force
in
settling
disputes
is
apparent
to
both
sides
yet
as
in
other
issues
dividing
men
and
nations
we
cannot
expect
sudden
and
revolutionary
results
but
we
must
find
some
place
to
begin
one
obvious
road
on
which
to
make
a
useful
start
is
in
the
widening
of
communication
between
our
two
peoples
in
this
field
there
are
both
sides
willing
countless
opportunitiesmost
of
them
well
known
to
us
allfor
developing
mutual
understanding
the
true
foundation
of
peace
another
avenue
may
be
through
the
reopening
on
january
twelfth
of
negotiations
looking
to
a
controlled
ban
on
the
testing
of
nuclear
weapons
unfortunately
the
closing
statement
from
the
soviet
scientists
who
met
with
our
scientists
at
geneva
in
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
develop
an
agreed
basis
for
a
test
ban
gives
the
clear
impression
that
their
conclusions
have
been
politically
guided
those
of
the
british
and
american
scientific
representatives
are
their
own
freelyformed
individual
and
collective
opinion
i
am
hopeful
that
as
new
negotiations
begin
truthnot
political
opportunismwill
be
the
guiding
light
of
the
deliberations
still
another
avenue
may
be
found
in
the
field
of
disarmament
in
which
the
soviets
have
professed
a
readiness
to
negotiate
seriously
they
have
not
however
made
clear
the
plans
they
may
have
if
any
for
mutual
inspection
and
verificationthe
essential
condition
for
any
extensive
measure
of
disarmament
there
is
one
instance
where
our
initiative
for
peace
has
recently
been
successful
a
multilateral
treaty
signed
last
month
provides
for
the
exclusively
peaceful
use
of
antarctica
assured
by
a
system
of
inspection
it
provides
for
free
and
cooperative
scientific
research
in
that
continent
and
prohibits
nuclear
explosions
there
pending
general
international
agreement
on
the
subject
the
treaty
is
a
significant
contribution
toward
peace
international
cooperation
and
the
advancement
of
science
i
shall
transmit
its
text
to
the
senate
for
consideration
and
approval
in
the
near
future
the
united
states
is
always
ready
to
participate
with
the
soviet
union
in
serious
discussion
of
these
or
any
other
subjects
that
may
lead
to
peace
with
justice
certainly
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
that
the
united
states
has
no
intention
of
interfering
in
the
internal
affairs
of
any
nation
likewise
we
reject
any
attempt
to
impose
its
system
on
us
or
on
other
peoples
by
force
or
subversion
this
concern
for
the
freedom
of
other
peoples
is
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
cement
which
has
allied
us
with
more
than
forty
other
nations
in
a
common
defense
effort
not
for
a
moment
do
we
forget
that
our
own
fate
is
firmly
fastened
to
that
of
these
countries
we
will
not
act
in
any
way
which
would
jeopardize
our
solemn
commitments
to
them
we
and
our
friends
are
of
course
concerned
with
selfdefense
growing
out
of
this
concern
is
the
realization
that
all
people
of
the
free
world
have
a
great
stake
in
the
progress
in
freedom
of
the
uncommitted
and
newly
emerging
nations
these
peoples
desperately
hoping
to
lift
themselves
to
decent
levels
of
living
must
not
by
our
neglect
be
forced
to
seek
help
from
and
finally
become
virtual
satellites
of
those
who
proclaim
their
hostility
to
freedom
their
natural
desire
for
a
better
life
must
not
be
frustrated
by
withholding
from
them
necessary
technical
and
investment
assistance
this
is
a
problem
to
be
solved
not
by
america
alone
but
also
by
every
nation
cherishing
the
same
ideals
and
in
position
to
provide
help
in
recent
years
americas
partners
and
friends
in
western
europe
and
japan
have
made
great
economic
progress
their
newly
found
economic
strength
is
eloquent
testimony
to
the
striking
success
of
the
policies
of
economic
cooperation
which
we
and
they
have
pursued
the
international
economy
of
is
markedly
different
from
that
of
the
early
postwar
years
no
longer
is
the
united
states
the
only
major
industrial
country
capable
of
providing
substantial
amounts
of
the
resources
so
urgently
needed
in
the
newlydeveloping
countries
to
remain
secure
and
prosperous
themselves
wealthy
nations
must
extend
the
kind
of
cooperation
to
the
less
fortunate
members
that
will
inspire
hope
confidence
and
progress
a
rich
nation
can
for
a
time
without
noticeable
damage
to
itself
pursue
a
course
of
selfindulgence
making
its
single
goal
the
material
ease
and
comfort
of
its
own
citizensthus
repudiating
its
own
spiritual
and
material
stake
in
a
peaceful
and
prosperous
society
of
nations
but
the
enmities
it
will
incur
the
isolation
into
which
it
will
descend
and
the
internal
moral
and
physical
softness
that
will
be
engendered
will
in
the
long
term
bring
it
to
disaster
america
did
not
become
great
through
softness
and
selfindulgence
her
miraculous
progress
and
achievements
flow
from
other
qualities
far
more
worthy
and
substantial
adherence
to
principles
and
methods
consonant
with
our
religious
philosophy
a
satisfaction
in
hard
work
the
readiness
to
sacrifice
for
worthwhile
causes
the
courage
to
meet
every
challenge
to
her
progress
the
intellectual
honesty
and
capacity
to
recognize
the
true
path
of
her
own
best
interests
to
us
and
to
every
nation
of
the
free
world
rich
or
poor
these
qualities
are
necessary
today
as
never
before
if
we
are
to
march
together
to
greater
security
prosperity
and
peace
i
believe
the
industrial
countries
are
ready
to
participate
actively
in
supplementing
the
efforts
of
the
developing
countries
to
achieve
progress
the
immediate
need
for
this
kind
of
cooperation
is
underscored
by
the
strain
in
our
international
balance
of
payments
our
surplus
from
foreign
business
transactions
has
in
recent
years
fallen
substantially
short
of
the
expenditures
we
make
abroad
to
maintain
our
military
establishments
overseas
to
finance
private
investment
and
to
provide
assistance
to
the
less
developed
nations
in
our
deficit
in
balance
of
payments
approached
billion
continuing
deficits
of
anything
like
this
magnitude
would
over
time
impair
our
own
economic
growth
and
check
the
forward
progress
of
the
free
world
we
must
meet
this
situation
by
promoting
a
rising
volume
of
exports
and
world
trade
further
we
must
induce
all
industrialized
nations
of
the
free
world
to
work
together
in
a
new
cooperative
endeavor
to
help
lift
the
scourge
of
poverty
from
less
fortunate
nations
this
will
provide
for
better
sharing
of
this
burden
and
for
still
further
profitable
trade
new
nations
and
others
struggling
with
the
problems
of
development
will
progress
only
if
they
demonstrate
faith
in
their
own
destiny
and
possess
the
will
and
use
their
own
resources
to
fulfill
it
moreover
progress
in
a
national
transformation
can
be
only
gradually
earned
there
is
no
easy
and
quick
way
to
follow
from
the
oxcart
to
the
jet
plane
but
just
as
we
drew
on
europe
for
assistance
in
our
earlier
years
so
now
do
those
new
and
emerging
nations
that
have
this
faith
and
determination
deserve
help
over
the
last
fifteen
years
twenty
nations
have
gained
political
independence
others
are
doing
so
each
year
most
of
them
are
woefully
lacking
in
technical
capacity
and
in
investment
capital
without
free
world
support
in
these
matters
they
cannot
effectively
progress
in
freedom
respecting
their
need
one
of
the
major

focal
points
of
our
concern
is
the
south
asian
region
here
in
two
nations
alone
are
almost
five
hundred
million
people
all
working
and
working
hard
to
raise
their
standards
and
in
doing
so
to
make
of
themselves
a
strong
bulwark
against
the
spread
of
an
ideology
that
would
destroy
liberty
i
cannot
express
to
you
the
depth
of
my
conviction
that
in
our
own
and
free
world
interests
we
must
cooperate
with
others
to
help
these
people
achieve
their
legitimate
ambitions
as
expressed
in
their
different
multiyear
plans
through
the
world
bank
and
other
instrumentalities
as
well
as
through
individual
action
by
every
nation
in
position
to
help
we
must
squarely
face
this
titanic
challenge
all
of
us
must
realize
of
course
that
development
in
freedom
by
the
newly
emerging
nations
is
no
mere
matter
of
obtaining
outside
financial
assistance
an
indispensable
element
in
this
process
is
a
strong
and
continuing
determination
on
the
part
of
these
nations
to
exercise
the
national
discipline
necessary
for
any
sustained
development
period
these
qualities
of
determination
are
particularly
essential
because
of
the
fact
that
the
process
of
improvement
will
necessarily
be
gradual
and
laborious
rather
than
revolutionary
moreover
everyone
should
be
aware
that
the
development
process
is
no
short
term
phenomenon
many
years
are
required
for
even
the
most
favorably
situated
countries
i
shall
continue
to
urge
the
american
people
in
the
interests
of
their
own
security
prosperity
and
peace
to
make
sure
that
their
own
part
of
this
great
project
be
amply
and
cheerfully
supported
free
world
decisions
in
this
matter
may
spell
the
difference
between
world
disaster
and
world
progress
in
freedom
other
countries
some
of
which
i
visited
last
month
have
similar
needs
a
common
meeting
ground
is
desirable
for
those
nations
which
are
prepared
to
assist
in
the
development
effort
during
the
past
year
i
have
discussed
this
matter
with
the
leaders
of
several
western
nations
because
of
its
wealth
of
experience
the
organization
for
european
economic
cooperation
could
help
with
initial
studies
the
goal
is
to
enlist
all
available
economic
resources
in
the
industrialized
free
worldespecially
private
investment
capital
but
i
repeat
that
this
help
no
matter
how
great
can
be
lastingly
effective
only
if
it
is
used
as
a
supplement
to
the
strength
of
spirit
and
will
of
the
people
of
the
newlydeveloping
nations
by
extending
this
help
we
hope
to
make
possible
the
enthusiastic
enrollment
of
these
nations
under
freedoms
banner
no
more
startling
contrast
to
a
system
of
sullen
satellites
could
be
imagined
if
we
grasp
this
opportunity
to
build
an
age
of
productive
partnership
between
the
less
fortunate
nations
and
those
that
have
already
achieved
a
high
state
of
economic
advancement
we
will
make
brighter
the
outlook
for
a
world
order
based
upon
security
freedom
and
peace
otherwise
the
outlook
could
be
dark
indeed
we
face
what
may
be
a
turning
point
in
history
and
we
must
act
decisively
as
a
nation
we
can
successfully
pursue
these
objectives
only
from
a
position
of
broadly
based
strength
no
matter
how
earnest
is
our
quest
for
guaranteed
peace
we
must
maintain
a
high
degree
of
military
effectiveness
at
the
same
time
we
are
engaged
in
negotiating
the
issue
of
arms
reduction
until
tangible
and
mutually
enforceable
arms
reduction
measures
are
worked
out
we
will
not
weaken
the
means
of
defending
our
institutions
america
possesses
an
enormous
defense
power
it
is
my
studied
conviction
that
no
nation
will
ever
risk
general
war
against
us
unless
we
should
be
so
foolish
as
to
neglect
the
defense
forces
we
now
so
powerfully
support
it
is
worldwide
knowledge
that
any
nation
which
might
be
tempted
today
to
attack
the
united
states
even
though
our
country
might
sustain
great
losses
would
itself
promptly
suffer
a
terrible
destruction
but
i
once
again
assure
all
peoples
and
all
nations
that
the
united
states
except
in
defense
will
never
turn
loose
this
destructive
power
during
the
past
year
our
longrange
striking
power
unmatched
today
in
manned
bombers
has
taken
on
new
strength
as
the
atlas
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
has
entered
the
operational
inventory
in
fourteen
recent
test
launchings
at
ranges
of
over
miles
atlas
has
been
striking
on
an
average
within
two
miles
of
the
target
this
is
less
than
the
length
of
a
jet
runwaywell
within
the
circle
of
total
destruction
such
performance
is
a
great
tribute
to
american
scientists
and
engineers
who
in
the
past
five
years
have
had
to
telescope
time
and
technology
to
develop
these
longrange
ballistic
missiles
where
america
had
none
before
this
year
moreover
growing
numbers
of
nuclearpowered
submarines
will
enter
our
active
forces
some
to
be
armed
with
polaris
missiles
these
remarkable
ships
and
weapons
ranging
the
oceans
will
be
capable
of
accurate
fire
on
targets
virtually
anywhere
on
earth
impossible
to
destroy
by
surprise
attack
they
will
become
one
of
our
most
effective
sentinels
for
peace
to
meet
situations
of
less
than
general
nuclear
war
we
continue
to
maintain
our
carrier
forces
our
many
service
units
abroad
our
always
ready
army
strategic
forces
and
marine
corps
divisions
and
the
civilian
components
the
continuing
modernization
of
these
forces
is
a
costly
but
necessary
process
and
is
scheduled
to
go
forward
at
a
rate
which
will
steadily
add
to
our
strength
the
deployment
of
a
portion
of
these
forces
beyond
our
shores
on
land
and
sea
is
persuasive
demonstration
of
our
determination
to
stand
shouldertoshoulder
with
our
allies
for
collective
security
moreover
i
have
directed
that
steps
be
taken
to
program
our
military
assistance
to
these
allies
on
a
longer
range
basis
this
is
necessary
for
a
sounder
collective
defense
system
next
i
refer
to
our
effort
in
space
exploration
which
is
often
mistakenly
supposed
to
be
an
integral
part
of
defense
research
and
development
first
america
has
made
great
contributions
in
the
past
two
years
to
the
worlds
fund
of
knowledge
of
astrophysics
and
space
science
these
discoveries
are
of
present
interest
chiefly
to
the
scientific
community
but
they
are
important
foundationstones
for
more
extensive
exploration
of
outer
space
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
all
mankind
second
our
military
missile
program
going
forward
so
successfully
does
not
suffer
from
our
present
lack
of
very
large
rocket
engines
which
are
so
necessary
in
distant
space
exploration
i
am
assured
by
experts
that
the
thrust
of
our
present
missiles
is
fully
adequate
for
defense
requirements
third
the
united
states
is
pressing
forward
in
the
development
of
large
rocket
engines
to
place
much
heavier
vehicles
into
space
for
exploration
purposes
fourth
in
the
meantime
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
we
have
only
begun
to
probe
the
environment
immediately
surrounding
the
earth
using
launch
systems
presently
available
we
are
developing
satellites
to
scout
the
worlds
weather
satellite
relay
stations
to
facilitate
and
extend
communications
over
the
globe
for
navigation
aids
to
give
accurate
bearings
to
ships
and
aircraft
and
for
perfecting
instruments
to
collect
and
transmit
the
data
we
seek
this
is
the
area
holding
the
most
promise
for
early
and
useful
applications
of
space
technology
fifth
we
have
just
completed
a
years
experience
with
our
new
space
law
i
believe
it
deficient
in
certain
particulars
and
suggested
improvements
will
be
submitted
shortly
the
accomplishment
of
the
many
tasks
i
have
alluded
to
requires
the
continuous
strengthening
of
the
spiritual
intellectual
and
economic
sinews
of
american
life
the
steady
purpose
of
our
society
is
to
assure
justice
before
god
for
every
individual
we
must
be
ever
alert
that
freedom
does
not
wither
through
the
careless
amassing
of
restrictive
controls
or
the
lack
of
courage
to
deal
boldly
with
the
giant
issues
of
the
day
a
year
ago
when
i
met
with
you
the
nation
was
emerging
from
an
economic
downturn
even
though
the
signs
of
resurgent
prosperity
were
not
then
sufficiently
convincing
to
the
doubtful
today
our
surging
strength
is
apparent
to
everyone
promises
to
be
the
most
prosperous
year
in
our
history
yet
we
continue
to
be
afflicted
by
nagging
disorders
among
current
problems
that
require
solution
are
the
need
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
situations
of
prolonged
labormanagement
stalemate
the
persistent
refusal
to
come
to
grips
with
a
critical
problem
in
one
sector
of
american
agriculture
the
continuing
threat
of
inflation
together
with
the
persisting
tendency
toward
fiscal
irresponsibility
in
certain
instances
the
denial
to
some
of
our
citizens
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
every
american
was
disturbed
by
the
prolonged
dispute
in
the
steel
industry
and
the
protracted
delay
in
reaching
a
settlement
we
are
all
relieved
that
a
settlement
has
at
last
been
achieved
in
that
industry
percentagewise
by
this
settlement
the
increase
to
the
steel
companies
in
employment
costs
is
lower
than
in
any
prior
wage
settlement
since
world
war
ii
it
is
also
gratifying
to
note
that
despite
the
increase
in
wages
and
benefits
several
of
the
major
steel
producers
have
announced
that
there
will
be
no
increase
in
steel
prices
at
this
time
the
national
interest
demands
that
in
the
period
of
industrial
peace
which
has
been
assured
by
the
new
contract
both
management
and
labor
make
every
possible
effort
to
increase
efficiency
and
productivity
in
the
manufacture
of
steel
so
that
price
increases
can
be
avoided
one
of
the
lessons
of
this
story
is
that
the
potential
danger
to
the
entire
nation
of
longer
and
greater
strikes
must
be
met
to
insure
against
such
possibilities
we
must
of
course
depend
primarily
upon
the
good
commonsense
of
the
responsible
individuals
it
is
my
intention
to
encourage
regular
discussions
between
management
and
labor
outside
the
bargaining
table
to
consider
the
interest
of
the
public
as
well
as
their
mutual
interest
in
the
maintenance
of
industrial
peace
price
stability
and
economic
growth
to
me
it
seems
almost
absurd
for
the
united
states
to
recognize
the
need
and
so
earnestly
to
seek
for
cooperation
among
the
nation
s
unless
we
can
achieve
voluntary
dependable
abiding
cooperation
among
the
important
segments
of
our
own
free
society
failure
to
face
up
to
basic
issues
in
areas
other
than
those
of
labormanagement
can
cause
serious
strains
on
the
firm
freedom
supports
of
our
society
i
refer
to
agriculture
as
one
of
these
areas
our
basic
farm
laws
were
written
years
ago
in
an
emergency
effort
to
redress
hardship
caused
by
a
worldwide
depression
they
were
continuedand
their
economic
distortions
intensifiedduring
world
war
ii
in
order
to
provide
incentives
for
production
of
food
needed
to
sustain
a
wartorn
free
world
today
our
farm
problem
is
totally
different
it
is
that
of
effectively
adjusting
to
the
changes
caused
by
a
scientific
revolution
when
the
original
farm
laws
were
written
an
hours
farm
labor
produced
only
one
fourth
as
much
wheat
as
at
present
farm
legislation
is
woefully
outofdate
ineffective
and
expensive
for
years
we
have
gone
on
with
an
outmoded
system
which
not
only
has
failed
to
protect
farm
income
but
also
has
produced
soaring
threatening
surpluses
our
farms
have
been
left
producing
for
war
while
america
has
long
been
at
peace
once
again
i
urge
congress
to
enact
legislation
that
will
gear
production
more
closely
to
markets
make
costly
surpluses
more
manageable
provide
greater
freedom
in
farm
operations
and
steadily
achieve
increased
net
farm
incomes
another
issue
that
we
must
meet
squarely
is
that
of
living
within
our
means
this
requires
restraint
in
expenditure
constant
reassessment
of
priorities
and
the
maintenance
of
stable
prices
we
must
prevent
inflation
here
is
an
opponent
of
so
many
guises
that
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
recognize
but
our
clear
need
is
to
stop
continuous
and
general
price
risesa
need
that
all
of
us
can
see
and
feel
to
prevent
steadily
rising
costs
and
prices
calls
for
stern
selfdiscipline
by
every
citizen
no
person
city
state
or
organized
group
can
afford
to
evade
the
obligation
to
resist
inflation
for
every
american
pays
its
crippling
tax
inflations
ravages
do
not
end
at
the
waters
edge
increases
in
prices
of
the
goods
we
sell
abroad
threaten
to
drive
us
out
of
markets
that
once
were
securely
ours
whether
domestic
prices
so
high
as
to
be
noncompetitive
result
from
demands
for
toohigh
profit
margins
or
from
increased
labor
costs
that
outrun
growth
in
productivity
the
final
result
is
seriously
damaging
to
the
nation
we
must
fight
inflation
as
we
would
a
fire
that
imperils
our
home
only
by
so
doing
can
we
prevent
it
from
destroying
our
salaries
savings
pensions
and
insurance
and
from
gnawing
away
the
very
roots
of
a
free
healthy
economy
and
the
nations
security
one
major
method
by
which
the
federal
government
can
counter
inflation
and
rising
prices
is
to
insure
that
its
expenditures
are
below
its
revenues
the
debt
with
which
we
are
now
confronted
is
about
billion
dollars
with
interest
charges
alone
now
costing
taxpayers
about
billions
it
is
clear
that
this
debt
growth
must
stop
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
despite
the
unsettling
influences
of
the
recent
steel
strike
we
estimate
that
our
accounts
will
show
on
june
this
year
a
favorable
balance
of
approximately
million
i
shall
present
to
the
congress
for
a
balanced
budget
in
the
area
of
defense
expenditures
continue
at
the
record
peacetime
levels
of
the
last
several
years
with
a
single
exception
expenditures
in
every
major
category
of
health
education
and
welfare
will
be
equal
or
greater
than
last
year
in
space
expenditures
the
amounts
are
practically
doubled
but
the
overall
guiding
goal
of
this
budget
is
national
neednot
response
to
specific
group
local
or
political
insistence
expenditure
increases
other
than
those
i
have
indicated
are
largely
accounted
for
by
the
increased
cost
of
legislation
previously
enacted
footnote
at
this
point
the
president
interpolated
the
two
paragraphs
shown
in
brackets
i
repeat
this
budget
will
be
a
balanced
one
expenditures
will
be
billion
hundred
million
the
amount
of
income
over
outgo
described
in
the
budget
as
a
surplus
to
be
applied
against
our
national
debt
is
billion
hundred
million
personally
i
do
not
feel
that
any
amount
can
be
properly
called
a
surplus
as
long
as
the
nation
is
in
debt
i
prefer
to
think
of
such
an
item
as
reduction
on
our
childrens
inherited
mortgage
once
we
have
established
such
payments
as
normal
practice
we
can
profitably
make
improvements
in
our
tax
structure
and
thereby
truly
reduce
the
heavy
burdens
of
taxation
in
any
event
this
one
reduction
will
save
taxpayers
each
year
approximately
hundred
million
dollars
in
interest
costs
this
budget
will
help
ease
pressures
in
our
credit
and
capital
markets
it
will
enhance
the
confidence
of
people
all
over
the
world
in
the
strength
of
our
economy
and
our
currency
and
in
our
individual
and
collective
ability
to
be
fiscally
responsible
in
the
management
of
the
huge
public
debt
the
treasury
is
unfortunately
not
free
of
artificial
barriers
its
ability
to
deal
with
the
difficult
problems
in
this
field
has
been
weakened
greatly
by
the
unwillingness
of
the
congress
to
remove
archaic
restrictions
the
need
for
a
freer
hand
in
debt
management
is
even
more
urgent
today
because
the
costs
of
the
undesirable
financing
practices
which
the
treasury
has
been
forced
into
are
mounting
removal
of
this
roadblock
has
high
priority
in
my
legislative
recommendations
still
another
issue
relates
to
civil
rights
in
all
our
hopes
and
plans
for
a
better
world
we
all
recognize
that
provincial
and
racial
prejudices
must
be
combatted
in
the
long
perspective
of
history
the
right
to
vote
has
been
one
of
the
strongest
pillars
of
a
free
society
our
first
duty
is
to
protect
this
right
against
all
encroachment
in
spite
of
constitutional
guarantees
and
notwithstanding
much
progress
of
recent
years
bias
still
deprives
some
persons
in
this
country
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
early
in
your
last
session
i
recommended
legislation
which
would
help
eliminate
several
practices
discriminating
against
the
basic
rights
of
americans
the
civil
rights
commission
has
developed
additional
constructive
recommendations
i
hope
that
these
will
be
among
the
matters
to
be
seriously
considered
in
the
current
session
i
trust
that
congress
will
thus
signal
to
the
world
that
our
government
is
striving
for
equality
under
law
for
all
our
people
each
year
and
in
many
ways
our
nation
continues
to
undergo
profound
change
and
growth
in
the
past
months
we
have
hailed
the
entry
of
two
more
states
of
the
unionalaska
and
hawaii
we
salute
these
two
western
stars
proudly
our
vigorous
expansion
which
we
all
welcome
as
a
sign
of
health
and
vitality
is
manysided
we
are
for
example
witnessing
explosive
growth
in
metropolitan
areas
by
the
metropolitan
areas
of
the
united
states
will
occupy
twice
the
territory
they
do
today
the
roster
of
urban
problems
with
which
they
must
cope
is
staggering
they
involve
water
supply
cleaning
the
air
adjusting
local
tax
systems
providing
for
essential
educational
cultural
and
social
services
and
destroying
those
conditions
which
breed
delinquency
and
crime
in
meeting
these
we
must
if
we
value
our
historic
freedoms
keep
within
the
traditional
framework
of
our
federal
system
with
powers
divided
between
the
national
and
state
governments
the
uniqueness
of
this
system
may
confound
the
casual
observer
but
it
has
worked
effectively
for
nearly
years
i
do
not
doubt
that
our
urban
and
other
perplexing
problems
can
be
solved
in
the
traditional
american
method
in
doing
so
we
must
realize
that
nothing
is
really
solved
and
ruinous
tendencies
are
set
in
motion
by
yielding
to
the
deceptive
bait
of
the
easy
federal
tax
dollar
our
educational
system
provides
a
ready
example
all
recognize
the
vital
necessity
of
having
modern
school
plants
wellqualified
and
adequately
compensated
teachers
and
of
using
the
best
possible
teaching
techniques
and
curricula
we
cannot
be
complacent
about
educating
our
youth
but
the
route
to
better
trained
minds
is
not
through
the
swift
administration
of
a
federal
hypodermic
or
sustained
financial
transfusion
the
educational
process
essentially
a
local
and
personal
responsibility
cannot
be
made
to
leap
ahead
by
crash
centralized
governmental
action
the
administration
has
proposed
a
carefully
reasoned
program
for
helping
eliminate
current
deficiencies
it
is
designed
to
stimulate
classroom
construction
not
by
substitution
of
federal
dollars
for
state
and
local
funds
but
by
incentives
to
extend
and
encourage
state
and
local
efforts
this
approach
rejects
the
notion
of
federal
domination
or
control
it
is
workable
and
should
appeal
to
every
american
interested
in
advancement
of
our
educational
system
in
the
traditional
american
way
i
urge
the
congress
to
take
action
upon
it
there
is
one
other
subject
concerning
which
i
renew
a
recommendation
i
made
in
my
state
of
the
union
message
last
january
i
then
advised
the
congress
of
my
purpose
to
intensify
our
efforts
to
replace
force
with
a
rule
of
law
among
nations
from
many
discussions
abroad
i
am
convinced
that
purpose
is
widely
and
deeply
shared
by
other
peoples
and
nations
of
the
world
in
the
same
message
i
stated
that
our
efforts
would
include
a
reexamination
of
our
own
relation
to
the
international
court
of
justice
the
court
was
established
by
the
united
nations
to
decide
international
legal
disputes
between
nations
in
we
accepted
the
courts
jurisdiction
but
subject
to
a
reservation
of
the
right
to
determine
unilaterally
whether
a
matter
lies
essentially
within
domestic
jurisdiction
there
is
pending
before
the
senate
a
resolution
which
would
repeal
our
present
selfjudging
reservation
i
support
that
resolution
and
urge
its
prompt
passage
if
this
is
done
i
intend
to
urge
similar
acceptance
of
the
courts
jurisdiction
by
every
member
of
the
united
nations
here
perhaps
it
is
not
amiss
for
me
to
say
to
the
members
of
the
congress
in
this
my
final
year
of
office
a
word
about
the
institutions
we
respectively
represent
and
the
meaning
which
the
relationships
between
our
two
branches
has
for
the
days
ahead
i
am
not
unique
as
a
president
i
n
having
worked
with
a
congress
controlled
by
the
opposition
partyexcept
that
no
other
president
ever
did
it
for
quite
so
long
yet
in
both
personal
and
official
relationships
we
have
weathered
the
storms
of
the
past
five
years
for
this
i
am
grateful
my
deep
concern
in
the
next
twelve
months
before
my
successor
takes
office
is
with
our
joint
congressionalexecutive
duty
to
our
own
and
to
other
nations
acting
upon
the
beliefs
i
have
expressed
here
today
i
shall
devote
my
full
energies
to
the
tasks
at
hand
whether
these
involve
travel
for
promoting
greater
world
understanding
negotiations
to
reduce
international
discord
or
constant
discussions
and
communications
with
the
congress
and
the
american
people
on
issues
both
domestic
and
foreign
in
pursuit
of
these
objectives
i
look
forward
to
and
shall
dedicate
myself
to
a
close
and
constructive
association
with
the
congress
every
minute
spent
in
irrelevant
interbranch
wrangling
is
precious
time
taken
from
the
intelligent
initiation
and
adoption
of
coherent
policies
for
our
national
survival
and
progress
we
seek
a
common
goalbrighter
opportunity
for
our
own
citizens
and
a
world
peace
with
justice
for
all
before
us
and
our
friends
is
the
challenge
of
an
ideology
which
for
more
than
four
decades
has
trumpeted
abroad
its
purpose
of
gaining
ultimate
victory
over
all
forms
of
government
at
variance
with
its
own
we
realize
that
however
much
we
repudiate
the
tenets
of
imperialistic
communism
it
represents
a
gigantic
enterprise
grimly
pursued
by
leaders
who
compel
its
subjects
to
subordinate
their
freedom
of
action
and
spirit
and
personal
desires
for
some
hopedfor
advantage
in
the
future
the
communists
can
present
an
array
of
material
accomplishments
over
the
past
fifteen
years
that
lends
a
false
persuasiveness
to
many
of
their
glittering
promises
to
the
uncommitted
peoples
the
competition
they
provide
is
formidable
but
in
our
scale
of
values
we
place
freedom
firstour
whole
national
existence
and
development
have
been
geared
to
that
basic
concept
and
are
responsible
for
the
position
of
free
world
leadership
to
which
we
have
succeeded
it
is
the
highest
prize
that
any
nation
can
possess
it
is
one
that
communism
can
never
offer
and
americas
record
of
material
accomplishment
in
freedom
is
written
not
only
in
the
unparalleled
prosperity
of
our
own
nation
but
in
the
many
billions
we
have
devoted
to
the
reconstruction
of
free
world
economics
wrecked
by
world
war
ii
and
in
the
effective
help
of
many
more
billions
we
have
given
in
saving
the
independence
of
many
others
threatened
by
outside
domination
assuredly
we
have
the
capacity
for
handling
the
problems
in
the
new
era
of
the
worlds
history
we
are
now
entering
but
we
must
use
that
capacity
intelligently
and
tirelessly
regardless
of
personal
sacrifice
the
fissure
that
divides
our
political
planet
is
deep
and
wide
we
live
moreover
in
a
sea
of
semantic
disorder
in
which
old
labels
no
longer
faithfully
describe
police
states
are
called
peoples
democracies
armed
conquest
of
free
people
is
called
liberation
such
slippery
slogans
make
more
difficult
the
problem
of
communicating
true
faith
facts
and
beliefs
we
must
make
clear
our
peaceful
intentions
our
aspirations
for
a
better
world
so
doing
we
must
use
language
to
enlighten
the
mind
not
as
the
instrument
of
the
studied
innuendo
and
distorter
of
truth
and
we
must
live
by
what
we
say
on
my
recent
visit
to
distant
lands
i
found
one
statesman
after
another
eager
to
tell
me
of
the
elements
of
their
government
that
had
been
borrowed
from
our
american
constitution
and
from
the
indestructible
ideals
set
forth
in
our
declaration
of
independence
as
a
nation
we
take
pride
that
our
own
constitutional
system
and
the
ideals
which
sustain
it
have
been
long
viewed
as
a
fountainhead
of
freedom
by
our
every
action
we
must
strive
to
make
ourselves
worthy
of
this
trust
ever
mindful
that
an
accumulation
of
seemingly
minor
encroachments
upon
freedom
gradually
could
break
down
the
entire
fabric
of
a
free
society
so
persuaded
we
shall
get
on
with
the
task
before
us
so
dedicated
and
with
faith
in
the
almighty
humanity
shall
one
day
achieve
the
unity
in
freedom
to
which
all
men
have
aspired
from
the
dawn
of
time

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
th
congress
my
fellow
citizens
this
is
the
moment
when
congress
and
the
executive
annually
begin
their
cooperative
work
to
build
a
better
america
one
basic
purpose
unites
us
to
promote
strength
and
security
side
by
side
with
liberty
and
opportunity
as
we
meet
today
in
the
th
year
of
the
republic
our
nation
must
continue
to
provideas
all
other
free
governments
have
had
to
do
throughout
timea
satisfactory
answer
to
a
question
as
old
as
history
it
is
can
government
based
upon
liberty
and
the
godgiven
rights
of
man
permanently
endure
when
ceaselessly
challenged
by
a
dictatorship
hostile
to
our
mode
of
life
and
controlling
an
economic
and
military
power
of
great
and
growing
strength
for
us
the
answer
has
always
been
found
and
is
still
found
in
the
devotion
the
vision
the
courage
and
the
fortitude
of
our
people
moreover
this
challenge
we
face
not
as
a
single
powerful
nation
but
as
one
that
has
in
recent
decades
reached
a
position
of
recognized
leadership
in
the
free
world
we
have
arrived
at
this
position
of
leadership
in
an
era
of
remarkable
productivity
and
growth
it
is
also
a
time
when
mans
power
of
mass
destruction
has
reached
fearful
proportions
possession
of
such
capabilities
helps
create
world
suspicion
and
tension
we
on
our
part
know
that
we
seek
only
a
just
peace
for
all
with
aggressive
designs
against
no
one
yet
we
realize
that
there
is
uneasiness
in
the
world
because
of
a
belief
on
the
part
of
peoples
that
through
arrogance
miscalculation
or
fear
of
attack
catastrophic
war
could
be
launched
keeping
the
peace
in
todays
world
more
than
ever
calls
for
the
utmost
in
the
nations
resolution
wisdom
steadiness
and
unremitting
effort
we
cannot
build
peace
through
desire
alone
moreover
we
have
learned
the
bitter
lesson
that
international
agreements
historically
considered
by
us
as
sacred
are
regarded
in
communist
doctrine
and
in
practice
to
be
mere
scraps
of
paper
the
most
recent
proof
of
their
disdain
of
international
obligations
solemnly
undertaken
is
their
announced
intention
to
abandon
their
responsibilities
respecting
berlin
as
a
consequence
we
can
have
no
confidence
in
any
treaty
to
which
communists
are
a
party
except
where
such
a
treaty
provides
within
itself
for
selfenforcing
mechanisms
indeed
the
demonstrated
disregard
of
the
communists
of
their
own
pledges
is
one
of
the
greatest
obstacles
to
success
in
substituting
the
rule
of
law
for
rule
by
force
yet
step
by
step
we
must
strengthen
the
institutions
of
peacea
peace
that
rests
upon
justicea
peace
that
depends
upon
a
deep
knowledge
and
dear
understanding
by
all
peoples
of
the
cause
and
consequences
of
possible
failure
in
this
great
purpose
to
achieve
this
peace
we
seek
to
prevent
war
at
any
place
and
in
any
dimension
if
despite
our
best
efforts
a
local
dispute
should
flare
into
armed
hostilities
the
next
problem
would
be
to
keep
the
conflict
from
spreading
and
so
compromising
freedom
in
support
of
these
objectives
we
maintain
forces
of
great
power
and
flexibility
our
formidable
air
striking
forces
are
a
powerful
deterrent
to
general
war
large
and
growing
portions
of
these
units
can
depart
from
their
bases
in
a
matter
of
minutes
similar
forces
are
included
in
our
naval
fleets
ground
and
other
tactical
formations
can
move
with
swiftness
and
precision
when
requested
by
friendly
and
responsible
governments
to
help
curb
threatened
aggression
the
stabilizing
influence
of
this
capacity
has
been
dramatically
demonstrated
more
than
once
over
the
past
year
our
military
and
related
scientific
progress
has
been
highly
gratifying
great
strides
have
been
made
in
the
development
of
ballistic
missiles
intermediate
range
missiles
are
now
being
deployed
in
operational
units
the
arias
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
program
has
been
marked
by
rapid
development
as
evidenced
by
recent
successful
tests
missile
training
units
have
been
established
and
launching
sites
are
far
along
in
construction
new
aircraft
that
fly
at
twice
the
speed
of
sound
are
entering
our
squadrons
we
have
successfully
placed
five
satellites
in
orbit
which
have
gathered
information
of
scientific
importance
never
before
available
our
latest
satellite
illustrates
our
steady
advance
in
rocketry
and
foreshadows
new
developments
in
worldwide
communications
warning
systems
constantly
improve
our
atomic
submarines
have
shattered
endurance
records
and
made
historic
voyages
under
the
north
polar
sea
a
major
segment
of
our
national
scientific
and
engineering
community
is
working
intensively
to
achieve
new
and
greater
developments
advance
in
military
technology
requires
adequate
financing
but
of
course
even
more
it
requires
talent
and
time
all
this
is
given
only
as
a
matter
of
history
as
a
record
of
our
progress
in
space
and
ballistic
missile
fields
in
no
more
than
four
years
of
intensive
effort
at
the
same
time
we
clearly
recognize
that
some
of
the
recent
soviet
accomplishments
in
this
particular
technology
are
indeed
brilliant
under
the
law
enacted
last
year
the
department
of
defense
is
being
reorganized
to
give
the
secretary
of
defense
full
authority
over
the
military
establishment
greater
efficiency
more
cohesive
effort
and
speedier
reaction
to
emergencies
are
among
the
many
advantages
we
are
already
noting
from
these
changes
these
few
highlights
point
up
our
steady
military
gains
we
are
rightfully
gratified
by
the
achievements
they
represent
but
we
must
remember
that
these
imposing
armaments
are
purchased
at
great
cost
national
security
programs
account
for
nearly
sixty
percent
of
the
entire
federal
budget
for
this
coming
fiscal
year
modern
weapons
are
exceedingly
expensive
the
overall
cost
of
introducing
atlas
into
our
armed
forces
will
average
million
per
missile
on
the
firing
line
this
year
we
are
investing
an
aggregate
of
close
to
billion
in
missile
programs
alone
other
billions
go
for
research
development
test
and
evaluation
of
new
weapons
systems
our
latest
atomic
submarines
will
cost
millions
each
while
some
special
types
will
cost
three
times
as
much
we
are
now
ordering
fighter
aircraft
which
are
priced
at
fifty
times
as
much
as
the
fighters
of
world
war
ii
we
are
buying
certain
bombers
that
cost
their
weight
in
gold
these
sums
are
tremendous
even
when
compared
with
the
marvelous
resiliency
and
capacity
of
our
economy
such
expenditures
demand
both
balance
and
perspective
in
our
planning
for
defense
at
every
turn
we
must
weigh
judge
and
select
needless
duplication
of
weapons
and
forces
must
be
avoided
we
must
guard
against
feverish
building
of
vast
armaments
to
meet
glibly
predicted
moments
of
socalled
maximum
peril
the
threat
we
face
is
not
sporadic
or
dated
it
is
continuous
hence
we
must
not
be
swayed
in
our
calculations
either
by
groundless
fear
or
by
complacency
we
must
avoid
extremes
for
vacillation
between
extremes
is
inefficient
costly
and
destructive
of
morale
in
these
days
of
unceasing
technological
advance
we
must
plan
our
defense
expenditures
systematically
and
with
care
fully
recognizing
that
obsolescence
compels
the
neverending
replacement
of
older
weapons
with
new
ones
the
defense
budget
for
the
coming
year
has
been
planned
on
the
basis
of
these
principles
and
considerations
over
these
many
months
i
have
personally
participated
in
its
development
the
aim
is
a
sensible
posture
of
defense
the
secondary
aim
is
increased
efficiency
and
avoidance
of
waste
both
are
achieved
by
this
budgetary
plan
working
by
these
guide
lines
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
america
can
be
as
sure
of
the
strength
and
efficiency
of
her
armed
forces
as
she
is
of
their
loyalty
i
am
equally
sure
that
the
nation
will
thus
avoid
useless
expenditures
which
in
the
name
of
security
might
tend
to
undermine
the
economy
and
therefore
the
nations
safety
our
own
vast
strength
is
only
a
part
of
that
required
for
dependable
security
because
of
this
we
have
joined
with
nearly
other
nations
in
collective
security
arrangements
in
these
common
undertakings
each
nation
is
expected
to
contribute
what
it
can
in
sharing
the
heavy
load
each
supplies
part
of
a
strategic
deployment
to
protect
the
forward
boundaries
of
freedom
constantly
we
seek
new
ways
to
make
more
effective
our
contribution
to
this
system
of
collective
security
recently
i
have
asked
a
committee
of
eminent
americans
of
both
parties
to
reappraise
our
military
assistance
programs
and
the
relative
emphasis
which
should
be
placed
on
military
and
economic
aid
i
am
hopeful
that
preliminary
recommendations
of
this
committee
will
be
available
in
time
to
assist
in
shaping
the
mutual
security
program
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
any
survey
of
the
free
worlds
defense
structure
cannot
fail
to
impart
a
feeling
of
regret
that
so
much
of
our
effort
and
resources
must
be
devoted
to
armaments
at
geneva
and
elsewhere
we
continue
to
seek
technical
and
other
agreements
that
may
help
to
open
up
with
some
promise
the
issues
of
international
disarmament
america
will
never
give
up
the
hope
that
eventually
all
nations
can
with
mutual
confidence
drastically
reduce
these
nonproductive
expenditures
ii
the
material
foundation
of
our
national
safety
is
a
strong
and
expanding
economy
this
we
haveand
this
we
must
maintain
only
with
such
an
economy
can
we
be
secure
and
simultaneously
provide
for
the
wellbeing
of
our
people
a
year
ago
the
nation
was
experiencing
a
decline
in
employment
and
output
today
that
recession
is
fading
into
history
and
this
without
gigantic
hastilyimprovised
public
works
projects
or
untimely
tax
reductions
a
healthy
and
vigorous
recovery
has
been
under
way
since
last
may
new
homes
are
being
built
at
the
highest
rate
in
several
years
retail
sales
are
at
peak
levels
personal
income
is
at
an
alltime
high
the
marked
forward
thrust
of
our
economy
reaffirms
our
confidence
in
competitive
enterprise
butclearlywisdom
and
prudence
in
both
the
public
and
private
sectors
of
the
economy
are
always
necessary
our
outlook
is
this
commitments
for
our
armed
forces
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
military
assistance
exceed
billion
dollars
in
the
foreseeable
f
uture
they
are
not
likely
to
be
significantly
lower
with
an
annual
population
increase
of
three
million
other
governmental
costs
are
bound
to
mount
after
we
have
provided
wisely
for
our
military
strength
we
must
judge
how
to
allocate
our
remaining
government
resources
most
effectively
to
promote
our
wellbeing
and
economic
growth
federal
programs
that
will
benefit
all
citizens
are
moving
forward
next
year
we
will
be
spending
increased
amounts
on
health
programs
on
federal
assistance
to
science
and
education
on
the
development
of
the
nations
water
resources
on
the
renewal
of
urban
areas
and
on
our
vast
system
of
federalaid
highways
each
of
these
additional
outlays
is
being
made
necessary
by
the
surging
growth
of
america
let
me
illustrate
responsive
to
this
growth
federal
grants
and
long
term
loans
to
assist
major
types
of
capital
improvements
in
our
cities
will
total
over
billion
dollars
in
double
the
expenditure
of
two
years
ago
the
major
responsibility
for
development
in
these
fields
rests
in
the
localities
even
though
the
federal
government
will
continue
to
do
its
proper
part
in
meeting
the
genuine
needs
of
a
burgeoning
population
but
the
progress
of
our
economy
can
more
than
match
the
growth
of
our
needs
we
need
only
to
act
wisely
and
confidently
here
i
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
digress
long
enough
to
express
something
that
is
much
on
my
mind
the
basic
question
facing
us
today
is
more
than
mere
survivalthe
military
defense
of
national
life
and
territory
it
is
the
preservation
of
a
way
of
life
we
must
meet
the
world
challenge
and
at
the
same
time
permit
no
stagnation
in
america
unless
we
progress
we
regress
we
can
successfully
sustain
security
and
remain
true
to
our
heritage
of
freedom
if
we
clearly
visualize
the
tasks
ahead
and
set
out
to
perform
them
with
resolution
and
fervor
we
must
first
define
these
tasks
and
then
understand
what
we
must
do
to
perform
them
if
progress
is
to
be
steady
we
must
have
long
term
guides
extending
far
ahead
certainly
five
possibly
even
ten
years
they
must
reflect
the
knowledge
that
before
the
end
of
five
years
we
will
have
a
population
of
over
million
they
must
be
goals
that
stand
high
and
so
inspire
every
citizen
to
climb
always
toward
mounting
levels
of
moral
intellectual
and
material
strength
every
advance
toward
them
must
stir
pride
in
individual
and
national
achievements
to
define
these
goals
i
intend
to
mobilize
help
from
every
available
source
we
need
more
than
politically
ordained
national
objectives
to
challenge
the
best
efforts
of
free
men
and
women
a
group
of
selfless
and
devoted
individuals
outside
of
government
could
effectively
participate
in
making
the
necessary
appraisal
of
the
potentials
of
our
future
the
result
would
be
establishment
of
national
goals
that
would
not
only
spur
us
on
to
our
finest
efforts
but
would
meet
the
stern
test
of
practicality
the
committee
i
plan
will
comprise
educators
and
representatives
of
labor
management
finance
the
professions
and
every
other
kind
of
useful
activity
such
a
study
would
update
and
supplement
in
the
light
of
continuous
changes
in
our
society
and
its
economy
the
monumental
work
of
the
committee
on
recent
social
trends
which
was
appointed
in
by
president
hoover
its
report
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
has
had
a
beneficial
influence
on
national
development
the
new
committee
would
be
concerned
among
other
things
with
the
acceleration
of
our
economys
growth
and
the
living
standards
of
our
people
their
health
and
education
their
better
assurance
of
life
and
liberty
and
their
greater
opportunities
it
would
also
be
concerned
with
methods
to
meet
such
goals
and
what
levels
of
governmentlocal
state
or
federalmight
or
should
be
particularly
concerned
as
one
example
consider
our
schools
operated
under
the
authority
of
local
communities
and
states
in
their
capacity
and
in
their
quality
they
conform
to
no
recognizable
standards
in
some
places
facilities
are
ample
in
others
meager
pay
of
teachers
ranges
between
wide
limits
from
the
adequate
to
the
shameful
as
would
be
expected
quality
of
teaching
varies
just
as
widely
but
to
our
teachers
we
commit
the
most
valuable
possession
of
the
nation
and
of
the
familyour
children
we
must
have
teachers
of
competence
to
obtain
and
hold
them
we
need
standards
we
need
a
national
goal
once
established
i
am
certain
that
public
opinion
would
compel
steady
progress
toward
its
accomplishment
such
studies
would
be
helpful
i
believe
to
government
at
all
levels
and
to
all
individuals
the
goals
so
established
could
help
us
see
our
current
needs
in
perspective
they
will
spur
progress
we
do
not
forget
of
course
that
our
nations
progress
and
fiscal
integrity
are
interdependent
and
inseparable
we
can
afford
everything
we
clearly
need
but
we
cannot
afford
one
cent
of
waste
we
must
examine
every
item
of
governmental
expense
critically
to
do
otherwise
would
betray
our
nations
future
thrift
is
one
of
the
characteristics
that
has
made
this
nation
great
why
should
we
ignore
it
now
we
must
avoid
any
contribution
to
inflationary
processes
which
could
disrupt
sound
growth
in
our
economy
prices
have
displayed
a
welcome
stability
in
recent
months
and
if
we
are
wise
and
resolute
we
will
not
tolerate
inflation
in
the
years
to
come
but
history
makes
clear
the
risks
inherent
in
any
failure
to
deal
firmly
with
the
basic
causes
of
inflation
two
of
the
most
important
of
these
causes
are
the
wageprice
spiral
and
continued
deficit
financing
inflation
would
reduce
job
opportunities
price
us
out
of
world
markets
shrink
the
value
of
savings
and
penalize
the
thrift
so
essential
to
finance
a
growing
economy
inflation
is
not
a
robin
hood
taking
from
the
rich
to
give
to
the
poor
rather
it
deals
most
cruelly
with
those
who
can
least
protect
themselves
it
strikes
hardest
those
millions
of
our
citizens
whose
incomes
do
not
quickly
rise
with
the
cost
of
living
when
prices
soar
the
pensioner
and
the
widow
see
their
security
undermined
the
man
of
thrift
sees
his
savings
melt
away
the
white
collar
worker
the
minister
and
the
teacher
see
their
standards
of
living
dragged
down
inflation
can
be
prevented
but
this
demands
statesmanship
on
the
part
of
business
and
labor
leaders
and
of
government
at
all
levels
we
must
encourage
the
selfdiscipline
the
restraint
necessary
to
curb
the
wageprice
spiral
and
we
must
meet
current
costs
from
current
revenue
to
minimize
the
danger
of
future
soaring
prices
and
to
keep
our
economy
sound
and
expanding
i
shall
present
to
the
congress
certain
proposals
first
i
shall
submit
a
balanced
budget
for
the
next
year
a
year
expected
to
be
the
most
prosperous
in
our
history
it
is
a
realistic
budget
with
wholly
attainable
objectives
if
we
cannot
live
within
our
means
during
such
a
time
of
rising
prosperity
the
hope
for
fiscal
integrity
will
fade
if
we
persist
in
living
beyond
our
means
we
make
it
difficult
for
every
family
in
our
land
to
balance
its
own
household
budget
but
to
live
within
our
means
would
be
a
tangible
demonstration
of
the
selfdiscipline
needed
to
assure
a
stable
dollar
the
constitution
entrusts
the
executive
with
many
functions
but
the
congressand
the
congress
alonehas
the
power
of
the
purse
ultimately
upon
congress
rests
responsibility
for
determining
the
scope
and
amount
of
federal
spending
by
working
together
the
congress
and
the
executive
can
keep
a
balance
between
income
and
outgo
if
this
is
done
there
is
real
hope
that
we
can
look
forward
to
a
time
in
the
foreseeable
future
when
needed
tax
reforms
can
be
accomplished
in
this
hope
i
am
requesting
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
prepare
appropriate
proposals
for
revising
at
the
proper
time
our
tax
structure
to
remove
inequities
and
to
enhance
incentives
for
all
americans
to
work
to
save
and
to
invest
such
recommendations
will
be
made
as
soon
as
our
fiscal
condition
permits
these
prospects
will
be
brightened
if
expenditures
do
not
exceed
the
levels
recommended
second
i
shall
recommend
to
the
congress
that
the
chief
executive
be
given
the
responsibility
either
to
approve
or
to
veto
specific
items
in
appropriations
and
authorization
bills
this
would
save
tax
dollars
third
to
reduce
federal
operations
in
an
area
where
private
enterprise
can
do
the
job
i
shall
recommend
legislation
for
greater
flexibility
in
extending
federal
credit
and
in
improving
the
procedures
under
which
private
credits
are
insured
or
guaranteed
present
practices
have
needlessly
added
large
sums
to
federal
expenditures
fourth
action
is
required
to
make
more
effective
use
of
the
large
federal
expenditures
for
agriculture
and
to
achieve
greater
fiscal
control
in
this
area
outlays
of
the
department
of
agriculture
for
the
current
fiscal
year
for
the
support
of
farm
prices
on
a
very
few
farm
products
will
exceed
five
billion
dollars
that
is
a
sum
equal
to
approximately
twofifths
of
the
net
income
of
all
farm
operators
in
the
entire
united
states
by
the
end
of
this
fiscal
year
it
is
estimated
that
there
will
be
in
government
hands
surplus
farm
products
worth
about
nine
billion
dollars
and
by
july
government
expenditures
for
storage
interest
and
handling
of
its
agricultural
inventory
will
reach
a
rate
of
one
billion
dollars
a
year
this
level
of
expenditure
for
farm
products
could
be
made
willingly
for
a
temporary
period
if
it
were
leading
to
a
sound
solution
of
the
problem
but
unfortunately
this
is
not
true
we
need
new
legislation
in
the
past
i
have
sent
messages
to
the
congress
requesting
greater
freedom
for
our
farmers
to
manage
their
own
farms
and
greater
freedom
for
markets
to
reflect
the
wishes
of
producers
and
consumers
legislative
changes
that
followed
were
appropriate
in
direction
but
did
not
go
far
enough
the
situation
calls
for
prompt
and
forthright
action
recommendation
for
action
will
be
contained
in
a
message
to
be
transmitted
to
the
congress
shortly
these
fiscal
and
related
actions
will
help
create
an
environment
of
price
stability
for
economic
growth
however
certain
additional
measures
are
needed
i
shall
ask
congress
to
amend
the
employment
act
of
to
make
it
clear
that
gove
rnment
intends
to
use
all
appropriate
means
to
protect
the
buying
power
of
the
dollar
i
am
establishing
a
continuing
cabinet
group
on
price
stability
for
economic
growth
to
study
governmental
and
private
policies
affecting
costs
prices
and
economic
growth
it
will
strive
also
to
build
a
better
public
understanding
of
the
conditions
necessary
for
maintaining
growth
and
price
stability
studies
are
being
undertaken
to
improve
our
information
on
prices
wages
and
productivity
i
believe
all
citizens
in
all
walks
of
life
will
support
this
program
of
action
to
accelerate
economic
growth
and
promote
price
stability
iii
i
take
up
next
certain
aspects
of
our
international
situation
and
our
programs
to
strengthen
it
americas
security
can
be
assured
only
within
a
world
community
strong
stable
independent
nations
in
which
the
concepts
of
freedom
justice
and
human
dignity
can
flourish
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
fortress
america
if
ever
we
were
reduced
to
the
isolation
implied
by
that
term
we
would
occupy
a
prison
not
a
fortress
the
question
whether
we
can
afford
to
help
other
nations
that
want
to
defend
their
freedom
but
cannot
fully
do
so
from
their
own
means
has
only
one
answer
we
can
and
we
must
we
have
been
doing
so
since
our
foreign
policy
has
long
been
dedicated
to
building
a
permanent
and
just
peace
during
the
past
six
years
our
free
world
security
arrangements
have
been
bolstered
and
the
bonds
of
freedom
have
been
more
closely
knit
our
friends
in
western
europe
are
experiencing
new
internal
vitality
and
are
increasingly
more
able
to
resist
external
threats
over
the
years
the
world
has
come
to
understand
clearly
that
it
is
our
firm
policy
not
to
countenance
aggression
in
lebanon
taiwan
and
berlinour
stand
has
been
dear
right
and
expressive
of
the
determined
will
of
a
united
people
acting
with
other
free
nations
we
have
undertaken
the
solemn
obligation
to
defend
the
people
of
free
berlin
against
any
effort
to
destroy
their
freedom
in
the
meantime
we
shall
constantly
seek
meaningful
agreements
to
settle
this
and
other
problems
knowing
full
well
that
not
only
the
integrity
of
a
single
city
but
the
hope
of
all
free
peoples
is
at
stake
we
need
likewise
to
continue
helping
to
build
the
economic
base
so
essential
to
the
free
worlds
stability
and
strength
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
world
bank
have
both
fully
proven
their
worth
as
instruments
of
international
financial
cooperation
their
executive
directors
have
recommended
an
increase
in
each
member

i
am
requesting
the
congress
for
immediate
approval
of
our
share
of
these
increases
we
are
now
negotiating
with
representatives
of
the
twenty
latin
american
republics
for
the
creation
of
an
interamerican
financial
institution
its
purpose
would
be
to
join
all
the
american
republics
in
a
common
institution
which
would
promote
and
finance
development
in
latin
america
and
make
more
effective
the
use
of
capital
from
the
world
bank
the
exportimport
bank
and
private
sources
private
enterprise
continues
to
make
major
contributions
to
economic
development
in
all
parts
of
the
world
but
we
have
not
yet
marshalled
the
full
potential
of
american
business
for
this
task
particularly
in
countries
which
have
recently
attained
their
independence
i
shall
present
to
this
congress
a
program
designed
to
encourage
greater
participation
by
private
enterprise
in
economic
development
abroad
further
all
of
us
know
that
to
advance
the
cause
of
freedom
we
must
do
much
more
than
help
build
sound
economies
the
spiritual
intellectual
and
physical
strength
of
people
throughout
the
world
will
in
the
last
analysis
determine
their
willingness
and
their
ability
to
resist
communism
to
give
a
single
illustration
of
our
many
efforts
in
these
fields
we
have
been
a
participant
in
the
effort
that
has
been
made
over
the
past
few
years
against
one
of
the
great
scourges
of
mankinddisease
through
the
mutual
security
program
public
health
officials
are
being
trained
by
american
universities
to
serve
in
less
developed
countries
we
are
engaged
in
intensive
malaria
eradication
projects
in
many
parts
of
the
world
americas
major
successes
in
our
own
country
prove
the
feasibility
of
success
everywhere
by
these
and
other
means
we
shall
continue
and
expand
our
campaign
against
the
afflictions
that
now
bring
needless
suffering
and
death
to
so
many
of
the
worlds
people
we
wish
to
be
part
of
a
great
shared
effort
toward
the
triumph
of
health
iv
america
is
best
described
by
one
word
freedom
if
we
hope
to
strengthen
freedom
in
the
world
we
must
be
ever
mindful
of
how
our
own
conduct
reacts
elsewhere
no
nation
has
ever
been
so
floodlighted
by
world
opinion
as
the
united
states
is
today
everything
we
do
is
carefully
scrutinized
by
other
peoples
throughout
the
world
the
bad
is
seen
along
with
the
good
because
we
are
human
we
err
but
as
free
men
we
are
also
responsible
for
correcting
the
errors
and
imperfections
of
our
ways
last
january
i
made
comprehensive
recommendations
to
the
congress
for
legislation
in
the
labormanagement
field
to
my
disappointment
congress
failed
to
act
the
mcclellan
committee
disclosures
of
corruption
racketeering
and
abuse
of
trust
and
power
in
labormanagement
affairs
have
aroused
america
and
amazed
other
peoples
they
emphasize
the
need
for
improved
local
law
enforcement
and
the
enactment
of
effective
federal
legislation
to
protect
the
public
interest
and
to
insure
the
rights
and
economic
freedoms
of
millions
of
american
workers
halfhearted
measures
will
not
do
i
shall
recommend
prompt
enactment
of
legislation
designed
to
safeguard
workers
funds
in
union
treasuries
against
misuse
of
any
kind
whatsoever
to
protect
the
rights
and
freedoms
of
individual
union
members
including
the
basic
right
to
free
and
secret
elections
of
officers
to
advance
true
and
responsible
collective
bargaining
to
protect
the
public
and
innocent
third
parties
from
unfair
and
coercive
practices
such
as
boycotting
and
blackmail
picketing
the
workers
and
the
public
must
have
these
vital
protections
in
other
areas
of
human
rightsfreedom
from
discrimination
in
voting
in
public
education
in
access
to
jobs
and
in
other
respectsthe
world
is
likewise
watching
our
conduct
the
image
of
america
abroad
is
not
improved
when
school
children
through
closing
of
some
of
our
schools
and
through
no
fault
of
their
own
are
deprived
of
their
opportunity
for
an
education
the
government
of
a
free
people
has
no
purpose
more
noble
than
to
work
for
the
maximum
realization
of
equality
of
opportunity
under
law
this
is
not
the
sole
responsibility
of
any
one
branch
of
our
government
the
judicial
arm
which
has
the
ultimate
authority
for
interpreting
the
constitution
has
held
that
certain
state
laws
and
practices
discriminate
upon
racial
grounds
and
are
unconstitutional
whenever
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
challenged
i
shall
continue
to
take
every
action
necessary
to
uphold
it
one
of
the
fundamental
concepts
of
our
constitutional
system
is
that
it
guarantees
to
every
individual
regardless
of
race
religion
or
national
origin
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
those
of
us
who
are
privileged
to
hold
public
office
have
a
solemn
obligation
to
make
meaningful
this
inspiring
objective
we
can
fulfill
that
obligation
by
our
leadership
in
teaching
persuading
demonstrating
and
in
enforcing
the
law
we
are
making
noticeable
progress
in
the
field
of
civil
rightswe
are
moving
forward
toward
achievement
of
equality
of
opportunity
for
all
people
everywhere
in
the
united
states
in
the
interest
of
the
nation
and
of
each
of
its
citizens
that
progress
must
continue
legislative
proposals
of
the
administration
in
this
field
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
early
in
the
session
all
of
us
should
help
to
make
clear
that
the
government
is
united
in
the
common
purpose
of
giving
support
to
the
law
and
the
decisions
of
the
courts
by
moving
steadily
toward
the
goal
of
greater
freedom
under
law
for
our
own
people
we
shall
be
the
better
prepared
to
work
for
the
cause
of
freedom
under
law
throughout
the
world
all
peoples
are
solely
tired
of
the
fear
destruction
and
the
waste
of
war
as
never
before
the
world
knows
the
human
and
material
costs
of
war
and
seeks
to
replace
force
with
a
genuine
role
of
law
among
nations
it
is
my
purpose
to
intensify
efforts
during
the
coming
two
years
in
seeking
ways
to
supplement
the
procedures
of
the
united
nations
and
other
bodies
with
similar
objectives
to
the
end
that
the
rule
of
law
may
replace
the
rule
of
force
in
the
affairs
of
nations
measures
toward
this
end
will
be
proposed
later
including
a
reexamination
of
our
own
relation
to
the
international
court
of
justice
finallylet
us
remind
ourselves
that
marxist
scripture
is
not
new
it
is
not
the
gospel
of
the
future
its
basic
objective
is
dictatorship
old
as
history
what
is
new
is
the
shining
prospect
that
man
can
build
a
world
where
all
can
live
in
dignity
we
seek
victorynot
over
any
nation
or
peoplebut
over
the
ancient
enemies
of
us
all
victory
over
ignorance
poverty
disease
and
human
degradation
wherever
they
may
be
found
we
march
in
the
noblest
of
causeshuman
freedom
if
we
make
ourselves
worthy
of
americas
ideals
if
we
do
not
forget
that
our
nation
was
founded
on
the
premise
that
all
men
are
creatures
of
gods
making
the
world
will
come
to
know
that
it
is
free
men
who
carry
forward
the
true
promise
of
human
progress
and
dignity

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
th
congress
it
is
again
my
high
privilege
to
extend
personal
greetings
to
the
members
of
the
th
congress
all
of
us
realize
that
as
this
new
session
begins
many
americans
are
troubled
about
recent
world
developments
which
they
believe
may
threaten
our
nations
safety
honest
men
differ
in
their
appraisal
of
americas
material
and
intellectual
strength
and
the
dangers
that
confront
us
but
all
know
these
dangers
are
real
the
purpose
of
this
message
is
to
outline
the
measures
that
can
give
the
american
people
a
confidencejust
as
realin
their
own
security
i
am
not
here
to
justify
the
past
gloss
over
the
problems
of
the
present
or
propose
easy
solutions
for
the
future
i
am
here
to
state
what
i
believe
to
be
right
and
what
i
believe
to
be
wrong
and
to
propose
action
for
correcting
what
i
think
wrong
i
there
are
two
tasks
confronting
us
that
so
far
outweigh
all
other
that
i
shall
devote
this
years
message
entirely
to
them
the
first
is
to
ensure
our
safety
through
strength
as
to
our
strength
i
have
repeatedly
voiced
this
conviction
we
now
have
a
broadly
based
and
efficient
defensive
strength
including
a
great
deterrent
power
which
is
for
the
present
our
main
guarantee
against
war
but
unless
we
act
wisely
and
promptly
we
could
lose
that
capacity
to
deter
attack
or
defend
ourselves
my
profoundest
conviction
is
that
the
american
people
will
say
as
one
man
no
matter
what
the
exertions
or
sacrifices
we
shall
maintain
that
necessary
strength
but
we
could
make
no
more
tragic
mistake
than
merely
to
concentrate
on
military
strength
for
if
we
did
only
this
the
future
would
hold
nothing
for
the
world
but
an
age
of
terror
and
so
our
second
task
is
to
do
the
constructive
work
of
building
a
genuine
peace
we
must
never
become
so
preoccupied
with
our
desire
for
military
strength
that
we
neglect
those
areas
of
economic
development
trade
diplomacy
education
ideas
and
principles
where
the
foundations
of
real
peace
must
be
laid
ii
the
threat
to
our
safety
and
to
the
hope
of
a
peaceful
world
can
be
simply
stated
it
is
communist
imperialism
this
threat
is
not
something
imagined
by
critics
of
the
soviets
soviet
spokesmen
from
the
beginning
have
publicly
and
frequently
declared
their
aim
to
expand
their
power
one
way
or
another
throughout
the
world
the
threat
has
become
increasingly
serious
as
this
expansionist
aim
has
been
reinforced
by
an
advancing
industrial
military
and
scientific
establishment
but
what
makes
the
soviet
threat
unique
in
history
is
its
allinclusiveness
every
human
activity
is
pressed
into
service
as
a
weapon
of
expansion
trade
economic
development
military
power
arts
science
education
the
whole
world
of
ideasall
are
harnessed
to
this
same
chariot
of
expansion
the
soviets
are
in
short
waging
total
cold
war
the
only
answer
to
a
regime
that
wages
total
cold
war
is
to
wage
total
peace
this
means
bringing
to
bear
every
asset
of
our
personal
and
national
lives
upon
the
task
of
building
the
conditions
in
which
security
and
peace
can
grow
iii
among
our
assets
let
us
first
briefly
glance
at
our
military
power
military
power
serves
the
cause
of
security
by
making
prohibitive
the
cost
of
any
aggressive
attack
it
serves
the
cause
of
peace
by
holding
up
a
shield
behind
which
the
patient
constructive
work
of
peace
can
go
on
but
it
can
serve
neither
cause
if
we
make
either
of
two
mistakes
the
one
would
be
to
overestimate
our
strength
and
thus
neglect
crucially
important
actions
in
the
period
just
ahead
the
other
would
be
to
underestimate
our
strength
thereby
we
might
be
tempted
to
become
irresolute
in
our
foreign
relations
to
dishearten
our
friends
and
to
lose
our
national
poise
and
perspective
in
approaching
the
complex
problems
ahead
any
orderly
balancesheet
of
military
strength
must
be
in
two
parts
the
first
is
the
position
as
of
today
the
second
is
the
position
in
the
period
ahead
as
of
today
our
defensive
shield
comprehends
a
vast
complex
of
ground
sea
and
air
units
superbly
equipped
and
strategically
deployed
around
the
world
the
most
powerful
deterrent
to
war
in
the
world
today
lies
in
the
retaliatory
power
of
our
strategic
air
command
and
the
aircraft
of
our
navy
they
present
to
any
potential
attacker
who
would
unleash
war
upon
the
world
the
prospect
of
virtual
annihilation
of
his
own
country
even
if
we
assume
a
surprise
attack
on
our
bases
with
a
marked
reduction
in
our
striking
power
our
bombers
would
immediately
be
on
their
way
in
sufficient
strength
to
accomplish
this
mission
of
retaliation
every
informed
government
knows
this
it
is
no
secret
since
the
korean
armistice
the
american
people
have
spent
billion
in
maintaining
and
strengthening
this
overall
defensive
shield
this
is
the
position
as
of
today
now
as
to
the
period
ahead
every
part
of
our
military
establishment
must
and
will
be
equipped
to
do
its
defensive
job
with
the
most
modern
weapons
and
methods
but
it
is
particularly
important
to
our
planning
that
we
make
a
candid
estimate
of
the
effect
of
longrange
ballistic
missiles
on
the
present
deterrent
power
i
have
described
at
this
moment
the
consensus
of
opinion
is
that
we
are
probably
somewhat
behind
the
soviets
in
some
areas
of
longrange
ballistic
missile
development
but
it
is
my
conviction
based
on
close
study
of
all
relevant
intelligence
that
if
we
make
the
necessary
effort
we
will
have
the
missiles
in
the
needed
quantity
and
in
time
to
sustain
and
strengthen
the
deterrent
power
of
our
increasingly
efficient
bombers
one
encouraging
fact
evidencing
this
ability
is
the
rate
of
progress
we
have
achieved
since
we
began
to
concentrate
on
these
missiles
the
intermediate
ballistic
missiles
thor
and
jupiter
have
already
been
ordered
into
production
the
parallel
progress
in
the
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
effort
will
be
advanced
by
our
plans
for
acceleration
the
development
of
the
submarinebased
polaris
missile
system
has
progressed
so
well
that
its
future
procurement
schedules
are
being
moved
forward
markedly
when
it
is
remembered
that
our
country
has
concentrated
on
the
development
of
ballistic
missiles
for
only
about
a
third
as
long
as
the
soviets
these
achievements
show
a
rate
of
progress
that
speaks
for
itself
only
a
brief
time
back
we
were
spending
at
the
rate
of
only
about
one
million
dollars
a
year
on
long
range
ballistic
missiles
in
we
spent
more
than
one
billion
dollars
on
the
arias
titan
thor
jupiter
and
polaris
programs
alone
but
i
repeat
gratifying
though
this
rate
of
progress
is
we
must
still
do
more
our
real
problem
then
is
not
our
strength
today
it
is
rather
the
vital
necessity
of
action
today
to
ensure
our
strength
tomorrow
what
i
have
just
said
applies
to
our
strength
as
a
single
country
but
we
are
not
alone
i
have
returned
from
the
recent
nato
meeting
with
renewed
conviction
that
because
we
are
a
part
of
a
worldwide
community
of
free
and
peaceful
nations
our
own
security
is
immeasurably
increased
by
contrast
the
soviet
union
has
surrounded
itself
with
captive
and
sullen
nations
like
a
crack
in
the
crust
of
an
uneasily
sleeping
volcano
the
hungarian
uprising
revealed
the
depth
and
intensity
of
the
patriotic
longing
for
liberty
that
still
burns
within
these
countries
the
world
thinks
of
us
as
a
country
which
is
strong
but
which
will
never
start
a
war
the
world
also
thinks
of
us
as
a
land
which
has
never
enslaved
anyone
and
which
is
animated
by
humane
ideals
this
friendship
based
on
common
ideals
is
one
of
our
greatest
sources
of
strength
it
cements
into
a
cohesive
security
arrangement
the
aggregate
of
the
spiritual
military
and
economic
strength
of
all
those
nations
which
with
us
are
allied
by
treaties
and
agreements
up
to
this
point
i
have
talked
solely
about
our
military
strength
to
deter
a
possible
future
war
i
now
want
to
talk
about
the
strength
we
need
to
win
a
different
kind
of
warone
that
has
already
been
launched
against
us
it
is
the
massive
economic
offensive
that
has
been
mounted
by
the
communist
imperialists
against
free
nations
the
communist
imperialist
regimes
have
for
some
time
been
largely
frustrated
in
their
attempts
at
expansion
based
directly
on
force
as
a
result
they
have
begun
to
concentrate
heavily
on
economic
penetration
particularly
of
newlydeveloping
countries
as
a
preliminary
to
political
domination
this
nonmilitary
drive
if
underestimated
could
defeat
the
free
world
regardless
of
our
military
strength
this
danger
is
all
the
greater
precisely
because
many
of
us
fail
or
refuse
to
recognize
it
thus
some
people
may
be
tempted
to
finance
our
extra
military
effort
by
cutting
economic
assistance
but
at
the
very
time
when
the
economic
threat
is
assuming
menacing
proportions
to
fail
to
strengthen
our
own
effort
would
be
nothing
less
than
reckless
folly
admittedly
most
of
us
did
not
anticipate
the
psychological
impact
upon
the
world
of
the
launching
of
the
first
earth
satellite
let
us
not
make
the
same
kind
of
mistake
in
another
field
by
failing
to
anticipate
the
much
more
serious
impact
of
the
soviet
economic
offensive
as
with
our
military
potential
our
economic
assets
are
more
than
equal
to
the
task
our
independent
farmers
produce
an
abundance
of
food
and
fibre
our
free
workers
are
versatile
intelligent
and
hardworking
our
businessmen
are
imaginative
and
resourceful
the
productivity
the
adaptability
of
the
american
economy
is
the
solid
foundationstone
of
our
security
structure
we
have
just
concluded
another
prosperous
year
our
output
was
once
more
the
greatest
in
the
nations
history
in
the
latter
part
of
the
year
some
decline
in
employment
and
output
occurred
following
the
exceptionally
rapid
expansion
of
recent
years
in
a
free
economy
reflecting
as
it
does
the
independent
judgments
of
millions
of
people
growth
typically
moves
forward
unevenly
but
the
basic
forces
of
growth
remain
unimpaired
there
are
solid
grounds
for
confidence
that
economic
growth
will
be
resumed
without
an
extended
interruption
moreover
the
federal
government
constantly
alert
to
signs
of
weakening
in
any
part
of
our
economy
always
stands
ready
with
its
full
power
to
take
any
a
ppropriate
further
action
to
promote
renewed
business
expansion
if
our
history
teaches
us
anything
it
is
this
lesson
so
far
as
the
economic
potential
of
our
nation
is
concerned
the
believers
in
the
future
of
america
have
always
been
the
realists
i
count
myself
as
one
of
this
company
our
longrange
problem
then
is
not
the
stamina
of
our
enormous
engine
of
production
our
problem
is
to
make
sure
that
we
use
these
vast
economic
forces
confidently
and
creatively
not
only
in
direct
military
defense
efforts
but
likewise
in
our
foreign
policy
through
such
activities
as
mutual
economic
aid
and
foreign
trade
in
much
the
same
way
we
have
tremendous
potential
resources
on
other
nonmilitary
fronts
to
help
in
countering
the
soviet
threat
education
science
research
and
not
least
the
ideas
and
principles
by
which
we
live
and
in
all
these
cases
the
task
ahead
is
to
bring
these
resources
more
sharply
to
bear
upon
the
new
tasks
of
security
and
peace
in
a
swiftlychanging
world
iv
there
are
many
items
in
the
administrations
program
of
a
kind
frequently
included
in
a
state
of
the
union
message
with
which
i
am
not
dealing
today
they
are
important
to
us
and
to
our
prosperity
but
i
am
reserving
them
for
treatment
in
separate
communications
because
of
my
purpose
today
of
speaking
only
about
matters
bearing
directly
upon
our
security
and
peace
i
now
place
before
you
an
outline
of
action
designed
to
focus
our
resources
upon
the
two
tasks
of
security
and
peace
in
this
special
category
i
list
eight
items
requiring
action
they
are
not
merely
desirable
they
are
imperative
defense
reorganization
the
first
need
is
to
assure
ourselves
that
military
organization
facilitates
rather
than
hinders
the
functioning
of
the
military
establishment
in
maintaining
the
security
of
the
nation
since
world
war
ii
the
purpose
of
achieving
maximum
organizational
efficiency
in
a
modern
defense
establishment
has
several
times
occasioned
action
by
the
congress
and
by
the
executive
the
advent
of
revolutionary
new
devices
bringing
with
them
the
problem
of
overall
continental
defense
creates
new
difficulties
reminiscent
of
those
attending
the
advent
of
the
airplane
half
a
century
ago
some
of
the
important
new
weapons
which
technology
has
produced
do
not
fit
into
any
existing
service
pattern
they
cut
across
all
services
involve
all
services
and
transcend
all
services
at
every
stage
from
development
to
operation
in
some
instances
they
defy
classification
according
to
branch
of
service
unfortunately
the
uncertainties
resulting
from
such
a
situation
and
the
jurisdictional
disputes
attending
upon
it
tend
to
bewilder
and
confuse
the
public
and
create
the
impression
that
service
differences
are
damaging
the
national
interest
let
us
proudly
remember
that
the
members
of
the
armed
forces
give
their
basic
allegiance
solely
to
the
united
states
of
that
fact
all
of
us
are
certain
but
pride
of
service
and
mistaken
zeal
in
promoting
particular
doctrine
has
more
than
once
occasioned
the
kind
of
difficulty
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
i
am
not
attempting
today
to
pass
judgment
on
the
charge
of
harmful
service
rivalries
but
one
thing
is
sure
whatever
they
are
america
wants
them
stopped
recently
i
have
had
under
special
study
the
neverending
problem
of
efficient
organization
complicated
as
it
is
by
new
weapons
soon
my
conclusions
will
be
finalized
i
shall
promptly
take
such
executive
action
as
is
necessary
and
in
a
separate
message
i
shall
present
appropriate
recommendations
to
the
congress
meanwhile
without
anticipating
the
detailed
form
that
a
reorganization
should
take
i
can
state
its
main
lines
in
terms
of
objectives
a
major
purpose
of
military
organization
is
to
achieve
real
unity
in
the
defense
establishment
in
all
the
principal
features
of
military
activities
of
all
these
one
of
the
most
important
to
our
nations
security
is
strategic
planning
and
control
this
work
must
be
done
under
unified
direction
the
defense
structure
must
be
one
which
as
a
whole
can
assume
with
top
efficiency
and
without
friction
the
defense
of
america
the
defense
establishment
must
therefore
plan
for
a
better
integration
of
its
defensive
resources
particularly
with
respect
to
the
newer
weapons
now
building
and
under
development
these
obviously
require
full
coordination
in
their
development
production
and
use
good
organization
can
help
assure
this
coordination
in
recognition
of
the
need
for
single
control
in
some
of
our
most
advanced
development
projects
the
secretary
of
defense
has
already
decided
to
concentrate
into
one
organization
all
the
antimissile
and
satellite
technology
undertaken
within
the
department
of
defense
another
requirement
of
military
organization
is
a
clear
subordination
of
the
military
services
to
duly
constituted
civilian
authority
this
control
must
be
real
not
merely
on
the
surface
next
there
must
be
assurance
that
an
excessive
number
of
compartments
in
organization
will
not
create
costly
and
confusing
compartments
in
our
scientific
and
industrial
effort
finally
to
end
interservice
disputes
requires
clear
organization
and
decisive
central
direction
supported
by
the
unstinted
cooperation
of
every
individual
in
the
defense
establishment
civilian
and
military
accelerated
defense
effort
the
second
major
action
item
is
the
acceleration
of
the
defense
effort
in
particular
areas
affected
by
the
fast
pace
of
scientific
and
technological
advance
some
of
the
points
at
which
improved
and
increased
effort
are
most
essential
are
these
we
must
have
sure
warning
in
case
of
attack
the
improvement
of
warning
equipment
is
becoming
increasingly
important
as
we
approach
the
period
when
longrange
missiles
will
come
into
use
we
must
protect
and
disperse
our
striking
forces
and
increase
their
readiness
for
instant
reaction
this
means
more
base
facilities
and
standby
crews
we
must
maintain
deterrent
retaliatory
power
this
means
among
other
things
steppedup
long
range
missile
programs
accelerated
programs
for
other
effective
missile
systems
and
for
some
years
more
advanced
aircraft
we
must
maintain
freedom
of
the
seas
this
means
nuclear
submarines
and
cruisers
improved
antisubmarine
weapons
missile
ships
and
the
like
we
must
maintain
all
necessary
types
of
mobile
forces
to
deal
with
local
conflicts
should
there
be
need
this
means
further
improvements
in
equipment
mobility
tactics
and
fire
power
through
increases
in
pay
and
incentive
we
must
maintain
in
the
armed
forces
the
skilled
manpower
modern
military
forces
require
we
must
be
forwardlooking
in
our
research
and
development
to
anticipate
and
achieve
the
unimagined
weapons
of
the
future
with
these
and
other
improvements
we
intend
to
assure
that
our
vigilance
power
and
technical
excellence
keep
abreast
of
any
realistic
threat
we
face
mutual
aid
third
we
must
continue
to
strengthen
our
mutual
security
efforts
most
people
now
realize
that
our
programs
of
military
aid
and
defense
support
are
an
integral
part
of
our
own
defense
effort
if
the
foundations
of
the
free
world
structure
were
progressively
allowed
to
crumble
under
the
pressure
of
communist
imperialism
the
entire
house
of
freedom
would
be
in
danger
of
collapse
as
for
the
mutual
economic
assistance
program
the
benefit
to
us
is
threefold
first
the
countries
receiving
this
aid
become
bulwarks
against
communist
encroachment
as
their
military
defenses
and
economies
are
strengthened
nations
that
are
conscious
of
a
steady
improvement
in
their
industry
education
health
and
standard
of
living
are
not
apt
to
fall
prey
to
the
blandishments
of
communist
imperialists
second
these
countries
are
helped
to
reach
the
point
where
mutually
profitable
trade
can
expand
between
them
and
us
third
the
mutual
confidence
that
comes
from
working
together
on
constructive
projects
creates
an
atmosphere
in
which
real
understanding
and
peace
can
flourish
to
help
bring
these
multiple
benefits
our
economic
aid
effort
should
be
made
more
effective
in
proposals
for
future
economic
aid
i
am
stressing
a
greater
use
of
repayable
loans
through
the
development
loan
fund
through
funds
generated
by
sale
of
surplus
farm
products
and
through
the
exportimport
bank
while
some
increase
in
government
funds
will
be
required
it
remains
our
objective
to
encourage
shifting
to
the
use
of
private
capital
sources
as
rapidly
as
possible
one
great
obstacle
to
the
economic
aid
program
in
the
past
has
been
not
a
rational
argument
against
it
on
the
merits
but
a
catchword
giveaway
program
the
real
fact
is
that
no
investment
we
make
in
our
own
security
and
peace
can
pay
us
greater
dividends
than
necessary
amounts
of
economic
aid
to
friendly
nations
this
is
no
giveaway
lets
stick
to
facts
we
cannot
afford
to
have
one
of
our
most
essential
security
programs
shot
down
with
a
slogan
mutual
trade
fourth
both
in
our
national
interest
and
in
the
interest
of
world
peace
we
must
have
a
fiveyear
extension
of
the
trade
agreements
act
with
broadened
authority
to
negotiate
world
trade
supports
a
significant
segment
of
american
industry
and
agriculture
it
provides
employment
for
four
and
onehalf
million
american
workers
it
helps
supply
our
ever
increasing
demand
for
raw
materials
it
provides
the
opportunity
for
american
free
enterprise
to
develop
on
a
worldwide
scale
it
strengthens
our
friends
and
increases
their
desire
to
be
friends
world
trade
helps
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
peace
by
making
all
free
nations
of
the
world
stronger
and
more
selfreliant
america
is
today
the
worlds
greatest
trading
nation
if
we
use
this
great
asset
wisely
to
meet
the
expanding
demands
of
the
world
we
shall
not
only
provide
future
opportunities
for
our
own
business
agriculture
and
labor
but
in
the
process
strengthen
our
security
posture
and
other
prospects
for
a
prosperous
harmonious
world
as
president
mckinley
said
as
long
ago
as
isolation
is
no
longer
possible
or
desirable
the
period
of
exclusiveness
is
past
scientific
cooperation
with
our
allies
fifth
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
the
congress
enact
the
necessary
legislation
to
enable
us
to
exchange
appropriate
scientific
and
technical
inf
ormation
with
friendly
countries
as
part
of
our
effort
to
achieve
effective
scientific
cooperation
it
is
wasteful
in
the
extreme
for
friendly
allies
to
consume
talent
and
money
in
solving
problems
that
their
friends
have
already
solvedall
because
of
artificial
barriers
to
sharing
we
cannot
afford
to
cut
ourselves
off
from
the
brilliant
talents
and
minds
of
scientists
in
friendly
countries
the
task
ahead
will
be
hard
enough
without
handcuffs
of
our
own
making
the
groundwork
for
this
kind
of
cooperation
has
already
been
laid
in
discussions
among
nato
countries
promptness
in
following
through
with
legislation
will
be
the
best
possible
evidence
of
american
unity
of
purpose
in
cooperating
with
our
friends
education
and
research
sixth
in
the
area
of
education
and
research
i
recommend
a
balanced
program
to
improve
our
resources
involving
an
investment
of
about
a
billion
dollars
over
a
four
year
period
this
involves
new
activities
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
designed
principally
to
encourage
improved
teaching
quality
and
student
opportunities
in
the
interests
of
national
security
it
also
provides
a
fivefold
increase
in
sums
available
to
the
national
science
foundation
for
its
special
activities
in
stimulating
and
improving
science
education
scrupulous
attention
has
been
paid
to
maintaining
local
control
of
educational
policy
spurring
the
maximum
amount
of
local
effort
and
to
avoiding
undue
stress
on
the
physical
sciences
at
the
expense
of
other
branches
of
learning
in
the
field
of
research
i
am
asking
for
substantial
increases
in
basic
research
funds
including
a
doubling
of
the
funds
available
to
the
national
science
foundation
for
this
purpose
but
federal
action
can
do
only
a
part
of
the
job
in
both
education
and
research
redoubled
exertions
will
be
necessary
on
the
part
of
all
americans
if
we
are
to
rise
to
the
demands
of
our
times
this
means
hard
work
on
the
part
of
state
and
local
governments
private
industry
schools
and
colleges
private
organizations
and
foundations
teachers
parents
andperhaps
most
important
of
allthe
student
himself
with
his
bag
of
books
and
his
homework
with
this
kind
of
allinclusive
campaign
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
can
create
the
intellectual
capital
we
need
for
the
years
ahead
invest
it
in
the
right
placesand
do
all
this
not
as
regimented
pawns
but
as
free
men
and
women
spending
and
saving
seventh
to
provide
for
this
extra
effort
for
security
we
must
apply
stern
tests
of
priority
to
other
expenditures
both
military
and
civilian
this
extra
effort
involves
most
immediately
the
need
for
a
supplemental
defense
appropriation
of
billion
for
fiscal
year
in
the
budget
increased
expenditures
for
missiles
nuclear
ships
atomic
energy
research
and
development
science
and
education
a
special
contingency
fund
to
deal
with
possible
new
technological
discoveries
and
increases
in
pay
and
incentives
to
obtain
and
retain
competent
manpower
add
up
to
a
total
increase
over
the
comparable
figures
in
the
budget
of
about
billion
i
believe
that
in
spite
of
these
necessary
increases
we
should
strive
to
finance
the
security
effort
out
of
expected
revenues
while
we
now
believe
that
expected
revenues
and
expenditures
will
roughly
balance
our
real
purpose
will
be
to
achieve
adequate
security
but
always
with
the
utmost
regard
for
efficiency
and
careful
management
this
purpose
will
require
the
cooperation
of
congress
in
making
careful
analysis
of
estimates
presented
reducing
expenditure
on
less
essential
military
programs
and
installations
postponing
some
new
civilian
programs
transferring
some
to
the
states
and
curtailing
or
eliminating
others
such
related
matters
as
the
national
debt
ceiling
and
tax
revenues
will
be
dealt
with
in
later
messages
works
of
peace
my
last
call
for
action
is
not
primarily
addressed
to
the
congress
and
people
of
the
united
states
rather
it
is
a
message
from
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
all
other
peoples
especially
those
of
the
soviet
union
this
is
the
spirit
of
what
we
would
like
to
say
in
the
last
analysis
there
is
only
one
solution
to
the
grim
problems
that
lie
ahead
the
world
must
stop
the
present
plunge
toward
more
and
more
destructive
weapons
of
war
and
turn
the
corner
that
will
start
our
steps
firmly
on
the
path
toward
lasting
peace
our
greatest
hope
for
success
lies
in
a
universal
fact
the
people
of
the
world
as
people
have
always
wanted
peace
and
want
peace
now
the
problem
then
is
to
find
a
way
of
translating
this
universal
desire
into
action
this
will
require
more
than
words
of
peace
it
requires
works
of
peace
now
may
i
try
to
give
you
some
concrete
examples
of
the
kind
of
works
of
peace
that
might
make
a
beginning
in
the
new
direction
for
a
start
our
people
should
learn
to
know
each
other
better
recent
negotiations
in
washington
have
provided
a
basis
in
principle
for
greater
freedom
of
communication
and
exchange
of
people
i
urge
the
soviet
government
to
cooperate
in
turning
principle
into
practice
by
prompt
and
tangible
actions
that
will
break
down
the
unnatural
barriers
that
have
blocked
the
flow
of
thought
and
understanding
between
our
people
another
kind
of
work
of
peace
is
cooperation
on
projects
of
human
welfare
for
example
we
now
have
it
within
our
power
to
eradicate
from
the
face
of
the
earth
that
ageold
scourge
of
mankind
malaria
we
are
embarking
with
other
nations
in
an
allout
fiveyear
campaign
to
blot
out
this
curse
forever
we
invite
the
soviets
to
join
with
us
in
this
great
work
of
humanity
indeed
we
would
be
willing
to
pool
our
efforts
with
the
soviets
in
other
campaigns
against
the
diseases
that
are
the
common
enemy
of
all
mortalssuch
as
cancer
and
heart
disease
if
people
can
get
together
on
such
projects
is
it
not
possible
that
we
could
then
go
on
to
a
fullscale
cooperative
program
of
science
for
peace
we
have
as
a
guide
and
inspiration
the
success
of
our

proposal
which
in
only
a
few
years
under
united
nations
auspices
became
a
reality
in
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
a
program
of
science
for
peace
might
provide
a
means
of
funneling
into
one
place
the
results
of
research
from
scientists
everywhere
and
from
there
making
it
available
to
all
parts
of
the
world
there
is
almost
no
limit
to
the
human
betterment
that
could
result
from
such
cooperation
hunger
and
disease
could
increasingly
be
driven
from
the
earth
the
ageold
dream
of
a
good
life
for
all
could
at
long
last
be
translated
into
reality
but
of
all
the
works
of
peace
none
is
more
needed
now
than
a
real
first
step
toward
disarmament
last
august
the
united
nations
general
assembly
by
an
overwhelming
vote
approved
a
disarmament
plan
that
we
and
our
allies
sincerely
believed
to
be
fair
and
practical
the
soviets
have
rejected
both
the
plan
and
the
negotiating
procedure
set
up
by
the
united
nations
as
a
result
negotiation
on
this
supremely
important
issue
is
now
at
a
standstill
but
the
world
cannot
afford
to
stand
still
on
disarmament
we
must
never
give
up
the
search
for
a
basis
of
agreement
our
allies
from
time
to
time
develop
differing
ideas
on
how
to
proceed
we
must
concert
these
convictions
among
ourselves
thereafter
any
reasonable
proposal
that
holds
promise
for
disarmament
and
reduction
of
tension
must
be
heard
discussed
and
if
possible
negotiated
but
a
disarmament
proposal
to
hold
real
promise
must
at
the
minimum
have
one
feature
reliable
means
to
ensure
compliance
by
all
it
takes
actions
and
demonstrated
integrity
on
both
sides
to
create
and
sustain
confidence
and
confidence
in
a
genuine
disarmament
agreement
is
vital
not
only
to
the
signers
of
the
agreement
but
also
to
the
millions
of
people
all
over
the
world
who
are
weary
of
tensions
and
armaments
i
say
once
more
to
all
peoples
that
we
will
always
go
the
extra
mile
with
anyone
on
earth
if
it
will
bring
us
nearer
a
genuine
peace
conclusion
these
then
are
the
ways
in
which
we
must
funnel
our
energies
more
efficiently
into
the
task
of
advancing
security
and
peace
these
actions
demand
and
expect
two
things
of
the
american
people
sacrifice
and
a
high
degree
of
understanding
for
sacrifice
to
be
effective
it
must
be
intelligent
sacrifice
must
be
made
for
the
right
purpose
and
in
the
right
placeeven
if
that
place
happens
to
come
close
to
home
after
all
it
is
no
good
demanding
sacrifice
in
general
terms
one
day
and
the
next
day
for
local
reasons
opposing
the
elimination
of
some
unneeded
federal
facility
it
is
pointless
to
condemn
federal
spending
in
general
and
the
next
moment
condemn
just
as
strongly
an
effort
to
reduce
the
particular
federal
grant
that
touches
ones
own
interest
and
it
makes
no
sense
whatever
to
spend
additional
billions
on
military
strength
to
deter
a
potential
danger
and
then
by
cutting
aid
and
trade
programs
let
the
world
succumb
to
a
present
danger
in
economic
guise
my
friends
of
the
congress
the
world
is
waiting
to
see
how
wisely
and
decisively
a
free
representative
government
will
now
act
i
believe
that
this
congress
possesses
and
will
display
the
wisdom
promptly
to
do
its
part
in
translating
into
law
the
actions
demanded
by
our
nations
interests
but
to
make
law
effective
our
kind
of
government
needs
the
full
voluntary
support
of
millions
of
americans
for
these
actions
i
am
fully
confident
that
the
response
of
the
congress
and
of
the
american
people
will
make
this
time
of
test
a
time
of
honor
mankind
then
will
see
more
clearly
than
ever
that
the
future
belongs
not
to
the
concept
of
the
regimented
atheistic
state
but
to
the
peoplethe
godfearing
peaceloving
people
of
all
the
world

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
i
appear
before
the
congress
today
to
report
on
the
state
of
the
union
and
the
relationships
of
the
union
to
the
other
nations
of
the
world
i
come
here
firmly
convinced
that
at
no
time
in
the
history
of
the
republic
have
circumstances
more
emphatically
underscored
the
need
in
all
echelons
of
government
for
vision
and
wisdom
and
resolution
you
meet
in
a
season
of
stress
that
is
testing
the
fitness
of
political
systems
and
the
validity
of
political
philosophies
each
stress
stems
in
part
from
causes
peculiar
to
itself
but
every
stress
is
a
reflection
of
a
universal
phenomenon
in
the
world
today
the
surging
and
understandable
tide
of
nationalism
is
marked
by
widespread
revulsion
and
revolt
against
tyranny
injustice
inequality
and
poverty
as
individuals
joined
in
a
common
hunger
for
freedom
men
and
women
and
even
children
pit
their
spirit
against
guns
and
tanks
on
a
larger
scale
in
an
ever
more
persistent
search
for
the
selfrespect
of
authentic
sovereignty
and
the
economic
base
on
which
national
independence
must
rest
peoples
sever
old
ties
seek
new
alliances
experimentsometimes
dangerouslyin
their
struggle
to
satisfy
these
human
aspirations
particularly
in
the
past
year
this
tide
has
changed
the
pattern
of
attitudes
and
thinking
among
millions
the
changes
already
accomplished
foreshadow
a
world
transformed
by
the
spirit
of
freedom
this
is
no
faint
and
pious
hope
the
forces
now
at
work
in
the
minds
and
hearts
of
men
will
not
be
spent
through
many
years
in
the
main
todays
expressions
of
nationalism
are
in
spirit
echoes
of
our
forefathers
struggle
for
independence
this
republic
cannot
be
aloof
to
these
events
heralding
a
new
epoch
in
the
affairs
of
mankind
our
pledged
word
our
enlightened
selfinterest
our
character
as
a
nation
commit
us
to
a
high
role
in
world
affairs
a
role
of
vigorous
leadership
ready
strength
sympathetic
understanding
the
state
of
the
union
at
the
opening
of
the
th
congress
continues
to
vindicate
the
wisdom
of
the
principles
on
which
this
republic
is
rounded
proclaimed
in
the
constitution
of
the
nation
and
in
many
of
our
historic
documents
and
rounded
in
devout
religious
convictions
these
principles
enunciate
a
vigilant
regard
for
human
liberty
a
wise
concern
for
human
welfare
a
ceaseless
effort
for
human
progress
fidelity
to
these
principles
in
our
relations
with
other
peoples
has
won
us
new
friendships
and
has
increased
our
opportunity
for
service
within
the
family
of
nations
the
appeal
of
these
principles
is
universal
lighting
fires
in
the
souls
of
men
everywhere
we
shall
continue
to
uphold
them
against
those
who
deny
them
and
in
counselling
with
our
friends
at
home
the
application
of
these
principles
to
the
complex
problems
of
our
national
life
has
brought
us
to
an
unprecedented
peak
in
our
economic
prosperity
and
has
exemplified
in
our
way
of
life
the
enduring
human
values
of
mind
and
spirit
through
the
past
four
years
these
principles
have
guided
the
legislative
programs
submitted
by
the
administration
to
the
congress
as
we
attempt
to
apply
them
to
current
events
domestic
and
foreign
we
must
take
into
account
the
complex
entity
that
is
the
united
states
of
america
what
endangers
it
what
can
improve
it
the
visible
structure
is
our
american
economy
itself
after
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
of
constant
expansion
it
is
still
rich
in
a
wide
variety
of
natural
resources
it
is
first
among
nations
in
its
peoples
mastery
of
industrial
skills
it
is
productive
beyond
our
own
needs
of
many
foodstuffs
and
industrial
products
it
is
rewarding
to
all
our
citizens
in
opportunity
to
earn
and
to
advance
in
selfrealization
and
in
selfexpression
it
is
fortunate
in
its
wealth
of
educational
and
cultural
and
religious
centers
it
is
vigorously
dynamic
in
the
limitless
initiative
and
willingness
to
venture
that
characterize
free
enterprise
it
is
productive
of
a
widely
shared
prosperity
our
economy
is
strong
expanding
and
fundamentally
sound
but
in
any
realistic
appraisal
even
the
optimistic
analyst
will
realize
that
in
a
prosperous
period
the
principal
threat
to
efficient
functioning
of
a
free
enterprise
system
is
inflation
we
look
back
on
four
years
of
prosperous
activities
during
which
prices
the
cost
of
living
have
been
relatively
stablethat
is
inflation
has
been
held
in
check
but
it
is
clear
that
the
danger
is
always
present
particularly
if
the
government
might
become
profligate
in
its
expenditures
or
private
groups
might
ignore
all
the
possible
results
on
our
economy
of
unwise
struggles
for
immediate
gain
this
danger
requires
a
firm
resolution
that
the
federal
government
shall
utilize
only
a
prudent
share
of
the
nations
resources
that
it
shall
live
within
its
means
carefully
measuring
against
need
alternative
proposals
for
expenditures
through
the
next
four
years
i
shall
continue
to
insist
that
the
executive
departments
and
agencies
of
government
search
out
additional
ways
to
save
money
and
manpower
i
urge
that
the
congress
be
equally
watchful
in
this
matter
we
pledge
the
governments
share
in
guarding
the
integrity
of
the
dollar
but
the
governments
efforts
cannot
be
the
entire
campaign
against
inflation
the
thief
that
can
rob
the
individual
of
the
value
of
the
pension
and
social
security
he
has
earned
during
his
productive
life
for
success
governments
efforts
must
be
paralleled
by
the
attitudes
and
actions
of
individual
citizens
i
have
often
spoken
of
the
purpose
of
this
administration
to
serve
the
national
interest
of
million
people
the
national
interest
must
take
precedence
over
temporary
advantages
which
may
be
secured
by
particular
groups
at
the
expense
of
all
the
people
in
this
regard
i
call
on
leaders
in
business
and
in
labor
to
think
well
on
their
responsibility
to
the
american
people
with
all
elements
of
our
society
they
owe
the
nation
a
vigilant
guard
against
the
inflationary
tendencies
that
are
always
at
work
in
a
dynamic
economy
operating
at
todays
high
levels
they
can
powerfully
help
counteract
or
accentuate
such
tendencies
by
their
wage
and
price
policies
business
in
its
pricing
policies
should
avoid
unnecessary
price
increases
especially
at
a
time
like
the
present
when
demand
in
so
many
areas
presses
hard
on
short
supplies
a
reasonable
profit
is
essential
to
the
new
investments
that
provide
more
jobs
in
an
expanding
economy
but
business
leaders
must
in
the
national
interest
studiously
avoid
those
price
rises
that
are
possible
only
because
of
vital
or
unusual
needs
of
the
whole
nation
if
our
economy
is
to
remain
healthy
increases
in
wages
and
other
labor
benefits
negotiated
by
labor
and
management
must
be
reasonably
related
to
improvements
in
productivity
such
increases
are
beneficial
for
they
provide
wage
earners
with
greater
purchasing
power
except
where
necessary
to
correct
obvious
injustices
wage
increases
that
outrun
productivity
however
are
an
inflationary
factor
they
make
for
higher
prices
for
the
public
generally
and
impose
a
particular
hardship
on
those
whose
welfare
depends
on
the
purchasing
power
of
retirement
income
and
savings
wage
negotiations
should
also
take
cognizance
of
the
right
of
the
public
generally
to
share
in
the
benefits
of
improvements
in
technology
freedom
has
been
defined
as
the
opportunity
for
selfdiscipline
this
definition
has
a
special
application
to
the
areas
of
wage
and
price
policy
in
a
free
economy
should
we
persistently
fail
to
discipline
ourselves
eventually
there
will
be
increasing
pressure
on
government
to
redress
the
failure
by
that
process
freedom
will
step
by
step
disappear
no
subject
on
the
domestic
scene
should
more
attract
the
concern
of
the
friends
of
american
working
men
and
women
and
of
free
business
enterprise
than
the
forces
that
threaten
a
steady
depreciation
of
the
value
of
our
money
concerning
developments
in
another
vital
sector
of
our
economyagriculturei
am
gratified
that
the
long
slide
in
farm
income
has
been
halted
and
that
further
improvement
is
in
prospect
this
is
heartening
progress
three

we

developedimproved
surplus
disposal
improved
price
support

and
the
soil
bankare
working
to
reduce
pricedepressing
government
stocks
of
farm

our
concern
for
the
wellbeing
of
farm
families
demands
that
we
constantly
search
for
new
ways
by
which
they
can
share
more
fully
in
our
unprecedented
prosperity
legislative
recommendations
in
the
field
of
agriculture
are
contained
in
the
budget
message
our
soil
water
mineral
forest
fish
and
wildlife
resources
are
being
conserved
and
improved
more
effectively
their
conservation
and
development
are
vital
to
the
present
and
future
strength
of
the
nation
but
they
must
not
be
the
concern
of
the
federal
government
alone
state
and
local
entities
and
private
enterprise
should
be
encouraged
to
participate
in
such
projects
i
would
like
to
make
special
mention
of
programs
for
making
the
best
uses
of
water
rapidly
becoming
our
most
precious
natural
resource
just
as
it
can
be
when
neglected
a
destroyer
of
both
life
and
wealth
there
has
been
prepared
and
published
a
comprehensive
water
report
developed
by
a
cabinet
committee
and
relating
to
all
phases
of
this
particular
problem
in
the
light
of
this
report
there
are
two
things
i
believe
we
should
keep
constantly
in
mind
the
first
is
that
each
of
our
great
river
valleys
should
be
considered
as
a
whole
piecemeal
operations
within
each
lesser
drainage
area
can
be
selfdefeating
or
at
the
very
least
needlessly
expensive
the
second
is
that
the
domestic
and
industrial
demands
for
water
grow
far
more
rapidly
than
does
our
population
the
whole
matter
of
making
the
best
use
of
each
drop
of
water
from
the
moment
it
touches
our
soil
until
it
reaches
the
oceans
for
such
purposes
as
irrigation
flood
control
power
production
and
domestic
and
industrial
uses
clearly
demands
the
closest
kind
of
cooperation
and
partnership
between
municipalities
states
and
the
federal
government
through
partnership
of
federal
state
and
local
authorities
in
these
vast
projects
we
can
obtain
the
economy
and
efficiency
of
development
and
operation

that
springs
from
a
lively
sense
of
local
responsibility
until
such
partnership
is
established
on
a
proper
and
logical
basis
of
sharing
authority
responsibility
and
costs
our
country
will
never
have
both
the
fully
productive
use
of
water
that
it
so
obviously
needs
and
protection
against
disastrous
flood
if
we
fail
in
this
all
the
many
tasks
that
need
to
be
done
in
america
could
be
accomplished
only
at
an
excessive
cost
by
the
growth
of
a
stifling
bureaucracy
and
eventually
with
a
dangerous
degree
of
centralized
control
over
our
national
life
in
all
domestic
matters
i
believe
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
will
expect
of
us
effective
action
to
remedy
past
failure
in
meeting
critical
needs
high
priority
should
be
given
the
school
construction
bill
this
will
benefit
children
of
all
races
throughout
the
countryand
children
of
all
races
need
schools
now
a
program
designed
to
meet
emergency
needs
for
more
classrooms
should
be
enacted
without
delay
i
am
hopeful
that
this
program
can
be
enacted
on
its
own
merits
uncomplicated
by
provisions
dealing
with
the
complex
problems
of
integration
i
urge
the
people
in
all
sections
of
the
country
to
approach
these
problems
with
calm
and
reason
with
mutual
understanding
and
good
will
and
in
the
american
tradition
of
deep
respect
for
the
orderly
processes
of
law
and
justice
i
should
say
here
that
we
have
much
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
progress
our
people
are
making
in
mutual
understandingthe
chief
buttress
of
human
and
civil
rights
steadily
we
are
moving
closer
to
the
goal
of
fair
and
equal
treatment
of
citizens
without
regard
to
race
or
color
but
unhappily
much
remains
to
be
done
last
year
the
administration
recommended
to
the
congress
a
fourpoint
program
to
reinforce
civil
rights
that
program
included
creation
of
a
bipartisan
commission
to
investigate
asserted
violations
of
civil
rights
and
to
make
recommendations
creation
of
a
civil
rights
division
in
the
department
of
justice
in
charge
of
an
assistant
attorney
general
enactment
by
the
congress
of
new
laws
to
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
voting
rights
and
amendment
of
the
laws
so
as
to
permit
the
federal
government
to
seek
from
the
civil
courts
preventive
relief
in
civil
rights
cases
i
urge
that
the
congress
enact
this
legislation
essential
to
the
stable
economic
growth
we
seek
is
a
system
of
welladapted
and
efficient
financial
institutions
i
believe
the
time
has
come
to
conduct
a
broad
national
inquiry
into
the
nature
performance
and
adequacy
of
our
financial
system
both
in
terms
of
its
direct
service
to
the
whole
economy
and
in
terms
of
its
function
as
the
mechanism
through
which
monetary
and
credit
policy
takes
effect
i
believe
the
congress
should
authorize
the
creation
of
a
commission
of
able
and
qualified
citizens
to
undertake
this
vital
inquiry
out
of
their
findings
and
recommendations
the
administration
would
develop
and
present
to
the
congress
any
legislative
proposals
that
might
be
indicated
for
the
purpose
of
improving
our
financial
machinery
in
this
message
it
seems
unnecessary
that
i
should
repeat
recommendations
involving
our
domestic
affairs
that
have
been
urged
upon
the
congress
during
the
past
four
years
but
which
in
some
instances
did
not
reach
the
stage
of
completely
satisfactory
legislation
the
administration
will
through
future
messages
either
directly
from
me
or
from
heads
of
the
departments
and
agencies
transmit
to
the
congress
specific
recommendations
these
will
involve
our
financial
and
fiscal
affairs
our
military
and
civil
defenses
the
administration
of
justice
our
agricultural
economy
our
domestic
and
foreign
commerce
the
urgently
needed
increase
in
our
postal
rates
the
development
of
our
natural
resources
our
labor
laws
including
our
labormanagement
relations
legislation
and
vital
aspects
of
the
health
education
and
welfare
of
our
people
there
will
be
special
recommendations
dealing
with
such
subjects
as
atomic
energy
the
furthering
of
public
works
the
continued
efforts
to
eliminate
government
competition
with
the
businesses
of
taxpaying
citizens
a
number
of
legislative
recommendations
will
be
mentioned
specifically
in
my
forthcoming
budget
message
which
will
reach
you
within
the
week
that
message
will
also
recommend
such
sums
as
are
needed
to
implement
the
proposed
action
turning
to
the
international
scene
the
existence
of
a
strongly
armed
imperialistic
dictatorship
poses
a
continuing
threat
to
the
free
worlds
and
thus
to
our
own
nations
security
and
peace
there
are
certain
truths
to
be
remembered
here
first
america
alone
and
isolated
cannot
assure
even
its
own
security
we
must
be
joined
by
the
capability
and
resolution
of
nations
that
have
proved
themselves
dependable
defenders
of
freedom
isolation
from
them
invites
war
our
security
is
also
enhanced
by
the
immeasurable
interest
that
joins
us
with
all
peoples
who
believe
that
peace
with
justice
must
be
preserved
that
wars
of
aggression
are
crimes
against
humanity
another
truth
is
that
our
survival
in
todays
world
requires
modern
adequate
dependable
military
strength
our
nation
has
made
great
strides
in
assuring
a
modern
defense
so
armed
in
new
weapons
so
deployed
so
equipped
that
today
our
security
force
is
the
most
powerful
in
our
peacetime
history
it
can
punish
heavily
any
enemy
who
undertakes
to
attack
us
it
is
a
major
deterrent
to
war
by
our
research
and
development
more
efficient
weaponssome
of
amazing
capabilitiesare
being
constantly
created
these
vital
efforts
we
shall
continue
yet
we
must
not
delude
ourselves
that
safety
necessarily
increases
as
expenditures
for
military
research
or
forces
in
being
go
up
indeed
beyond
a
wise
and
reasonable
level
which
is
always
changing
and
is
under
constant
study
money
spent
on
arms
may
be
money
wasted
on
sterile
metal
or
inflated
costs
thereby
weakening
the
very
security
and
strength
we
seek
national
security
requires
far
more
than
military
power
economic
and
moral
factors
play
indispensable
roles
any
program
that
endangers
our
economy
could
defeat
us
any
weakening
of
our
national
will
and
resolution
any
diminution
of
the
vigor
and
initiative
of
our
individual
citizens
would
strike
a
blow
at
the
heart
of
our
defenses
the
finest
military
establishment
we
can
produce
must
work
closely
in
cooperation
with
the
forces
of
our
friends
our
system
of
regional
pacts
developed
within
the
charter
of
the
united
nations
serves
to
increase
both
our
own
security
and
the
security
of
other
nations
this
system
is
still
a
recent
introduction
on
the
world
scene
its
problems
are
many
and
difficult
because
it
insists
on
equality
among
its
members
and
brings
into
association
some
nations
traditionally
divided
repeatedly
in
recent
months
the
collapse
of
these
regional
alliances
has
been
predicted
the
strains
upon
them
have
been
at
times
indeed
severe
despite
these
strains
our
regional
alliances
have
proved
durable
and
strong
and
dire
predictions
of
their
disintegration
have
proved
completely
false
with
other
free
nations
we
should
vigorously
prosecute
measures
that
will
promote
mutual
strength
prosperity
and
welfare
within
the
free
world
strength
is
essentially
a
product
of
economic
health
and
social
wellbeing
consequently
even
as
we
continue
our
programs
of
military
assistance
we
must
emphasize
aid
to
our
friends
in
building
more
productive
economies
and
in
better
satisfying
the
natural
demands
of
their
people
for
progress
thereby
we
shall
move
a
long
way
toward
a
peaceful
world
a
sound
and
safeguarded
agreement
for
open
skies
unarmed
aerial
sentinels
and
reduced
armament
would
provide
a
valuable
contribution
toward
a
durable
peace
in
the
years
ahead
and
we
have
been
persistent
in
our
effort
to
reach
such
an
agreement
we
are
willing
to
enter
any
reliable
agreement
which
would
reverse
the
trend
toward
ever
more
devastating
nuclear
weapons
reciprocally
provide
against
the
possibility
of
surprise
attack
mutually
control
the
outer
space
missile
and
satellite
development
and
make
feasible
a
lower
level
of
armaments
and
armed
forces
and
an
easier
burden
of
military
expenditures
our
continuing
negotiations
in
this
field
are
a
major
part
of
our
quest
for
a
confident
peace
in
this
atomic
age
this
quest
requires
as
well
a
constructive
attitude
among
all
the
nations
of
the
free
world
toward
expansion
of
trade
and
investment
that
can
give
all
of
us
opportunity
to
work
out
economic
betterment
an
essential
step
in
this
field
is
the
provision
of
an
administrative
agency
to
insure
the
orderly
and
proper
operation
of
existing
arrangements
trader
which
multilateral
trade
is
now
carried
on
to
that
end
i
urge
congressional
authorization
for
united
states
membership
in
the
proposed
organization
for
trade
cooperation
an
action
which
will
speed
removal
of
discrimination
against
our
export
trade
we
welcome
the
efforts
of
a
number
of
our
european
friends
to
achieve
an
integrated
community
to
develop
a
common
market
we
likewise
welcome
their
cooperative
effort
in
the
field
of
atomic
energy
to
demonstrate
once
again
our
unalterable
purpose
to
make
of
the
atom
a
peaceful
servant
of
humanity
i
shortly
shall
ask
the
congress
to
authorize
full
united
states
participation
in
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
world
events
have
magnified
both
the
responsibilities
and
the
opportunities
of
the
united
states
information
agency
just
as
in
recent
months
the
voice
of
communism
has
become
more
shaken
and
confused
the
voice
of
truth
must
be
more
clearly
heard
to
enable
our
information
agency
to
cope
with
these
new
responsibilities
and
opportunities
i
am
asking
the
congress
to
increase
appreciably
the
appropriations
for
this
program
and
for
legislation
establishing
a
career
service
for
the
agencys
overseas
foreign
service
officers
the
recent
historic
events
in
hungary
demand
that
all
free
nations
share
to
the
extent
of
their
capabilities
in
the
responsibility
of
granting
asylum
to
victims
of
communist
persecution
i
request
the
congress
promptly
to
enact
legislation
to
regularize
the
status
in
the
united
states
of
hungarian
refugees
brought
here
as
parolees
i
shal
l
shortly
recommend
to
the
congress
by
special
message
the
changes
in
our
immigration
laws
that
i
deem
necessary
in
the
light
of
our
world
responsibilities
the
cost
of
peace
is
something
we
must
face
boldly
fearlessly
beyond
money
it
involves
changes
in
attitudes
the
renunciation
of
old
prejudices
even
the
sacrifice
of
some
seeming
selfinterest
only
five
days
ago
i
expressed
to
you
the
grave
concern
of
your
government
over
the
threat
of
soviet
aggression
in
the
middle
east
i
asked
for
congressional
authorization
to
help
counter
this
threat
i
say
again
that
this
matter
is
of
vital
and
immediate
importance
to
the
nations
and
the
free
worlds
security
and
peace
by
our
proposed
programs
in
the
middle
east
we
hope
to
assist
in
establishing
a
climate
in
which
constructive
and
longterm
solutions
to
basic
problems
of
the
area
may
be
sought
from
time
to
time
there
will
be
presented
to
the
congress
requests
for
other
legislation
in
the
broad
field
of
international
affairs
all
requests
will
reflect
the
steadfast
purpose
of
this
administration
to
pursue
peace
based
on
justice
although
in
some
cases
details
will
be
new
the
underlying
purpose
and
objectives
will
remain
the
same
all
proposals
made
by
the
administration
in
this
field
are
based
on
the
free
worlds
unity
this
unity
may
not
be
immediately
obvious
unless
we
examine
link
by
link
the
chain
of
relationships
that
binds
us
to
every
area
and
to
every
nation
in
spirit
the
free
world
is
one
because
its
people
uphold
the
right
of
independent
existence
for
all
nations
i
have
already
alluded
to
their
economic
interdependence
but
their
interdependence
extends
also
into
the
field
of
security
first
of
all
no
reasonable
man
will
question
the
absolute
need
for
our
american
neighbors
to
be
prosperous
and
secure
their
security
and
prosperity
are
inextricably
bound
to
our
own
and
we
are
of
course
already
joined
with
these
neighbors
by
historic
pledges
again
no
reasonable
man
will
deny
that
the
freedom
and
prosperity
and
security
of
western
europe
are
vital
to
our
own
prosperity
and
security
if
the
institutions
the
skills
the
manpower
of
its
peoples
were
to
fall
under
the
domination
of
an
aggressive
imperialism
the
violent
change
in
the
balance
of
world
power
and
in
the
pattern
of
world
commerce
could
not
be
fully
compensated
for
by
any
american
measures
military
or
economic
but
these
people
whose
economic
strength
is
largely
dependent
on
free
and
uninterrupted
movement
of
oil
from
the
middle
east
cannot
prosperindeed
their
economies
would
be
severely
impairedshould
that
area
be
controlled
by
an
enemy
and
the
movement
of
oil
be
subject
to
its
decisions
next
to
the
eastward
are
asiatic
and
far
eastern
peoples
recently
returned
to
independent
control
of
their
own
affairs
or
now
emerging
into
sovereign
statehood
their
potential
strength
constitutes
new
assurance
for
stability
and
peace
in
the
worldif
they
can
retain
their
independence
should
they
lose
freedom
and
be
dominated
by
an
aggressor
the
worldwide
effects
would
imperil
the
security
of
the
free
world
in
short
the
world
has
so
shrunk
that
all
free
nations
are
our
neighbors
without
cooperative
neighbors
the
united
states
cannot
maintain
its
own
security
and
welfare
because
first
americas
vital
interests
are
worldwide
embracing
both
hemispheres
and
every
continent
second
we
have
community
of
interest
with
every
nation
in
the
free
world
third
interdependence
of
interests
requires
a
decent
respect
for
the
rights
and
the
peace
of
all
peoples
these
principles
motivate
our
actions
within
the
united
nations
there
before
all
the
world
by
our
loyalty
to
them
by
our
practice
of
them
let
us
strive
to
set
a
standard
to
which
all
who
seek
justice
and
who
hunger
for
peace
can
rally
may
we
at
home
here
at
the
seat
of
government
in
all
the
cities
and
towns
and
farmlands
of
america
support
these
principles
in
a
personal
effort
of
dedication
thereby
each
of
us
can
help
establish
a
secure
world
order
in
which
opportunity
for
freedom
and
justice
will
be
more
widespread
and
in
which
the
resources
now
dissipated
on
the
armaments
of
war
can
be
released
for
the
life
and
growth
of
all
humanity
when
our
forefathers
prepared
the
immortal
document
that
proclaimed
our
independence
they
asserted
that
every
individual
is
endowed
by
his
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
as
we
gaze
back
through
history
to
that
date
it
is
clear
that
our
nation
has
striven
to
live
up
to
this
declaration
applying
it
to
nations
as
well
as
to
individuals
today
we
proudly
assert
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
still
committed
to
this
concept
both
in
its
activities
at
home
and
abroad
the
purpose
is
divine
the
implementation
is
human
our
country
and
its
government
have
made
mistakeshuman
mistakes
they
have
been
of
the
headnot
of
the
heart
and
it
is
still
true
that
the
great
concept
of
the
dignity
of
all
men
alike
created
in
the
image
of
the
almighty
has
been
the
compass
by
which
we
have
tried
and
are
trying
to
steer
our
course
so
long
as
we
continue
by
its
guidance
there
will
be
true
progress
in
human
affairs
both
among
ourselves
and
among
those
with
whom
we
deal
to
achieve
a
more
perfect
fidelity
to
it
i
submit
is
a
worthy
ambition
as
we
meet
together
in
these
first
days
of
this
the
first
session
of
the
th
congress

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
opening
of
this
new
year
must
arouse
in
us
all
grateful
thanks
to
a
kind
providence
whose
protection
has
been
ever
present
and
whose
bounty
has
been
manifold
and
abundant
the
state
of
the
union
today
demonstrates
what
can
be
accomplished
under
god
by
a
free
people
by
their
vision
their
understanding
of
national
problems
their
initiative
their
selfreliance
their
capacity

by
their
willingness

the
past
three
years
responding
to
what
our
people
want
their
government
to
do
the
congress
and
the
executive
have
done
much
in
building
a
stronger
better
america
there
has
been
broad
progress
in
fostering
the
energies
of
our
people
in
providing
greater

require
that
we
approach
this
years
business
with
a
sober
humility
a
heedless
pride
in
our
present
strength
and
position
would
blind
us
to
the
facts
of
the
past
to
the
pitfalls
of
the
future
we
must
walk
ever
in
the
knowledge
that
we
are
enriched
by
a
heritage
earned
in
the
labor
and
sacrifice
of
our
forebears
that
for
our
childrens
children
we
are
trustees
of
a
great
republic
and
a
timetested
political
system
that
we
prosper
as
a
cooperating
member
of
the
family
of
nations
in
this
light
the
administration
has
continued
work
on
its
program
for
the
republic
begun
three
years
ago
because
the
vast
spread
of
national
and
human
interests
is
involved
within
it
i
shall
not
in
this
message
attempt
its
detailed
delineation
instead
from
time
to
time
during
this
session
there
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
specific
recommendations
within
specific
fields
in
the
comprehensive
survey
required
for
their
preparation
the
administration
is
guided
by
enduring
objectives
the
first
is
the
discharge
of
our
world
responsibility
our
world
policy
and
our
actions
are
dedicated
to
the
achievement
of
peace
with
justice
for
all
nations
with
this
purpose
we
move
in
a
wide
variety
of
ways
and
through
many
agencies
to
remove
the
pall
of
fear
to
strengthen
the
ties
with
our
partners
and
to
improve
the
cooperative
cohesion
of
the
free
world
to
reduce
the
burden
of
armaments
and
to
stimulate
and
inspire
action
among
all
nations
for
a
world
of
justice
and
prosperity
and
peace
these
national
objectives
are
fully
supported
by
both
our
political
parties
in
the
past
year
our
search
for
a
more
stable
and
just
peace
has
taken
varied
forms
among
the
most
important
were
the
two
conferences
at
geneva
in
july
and
in
the
fall
of
last
year
we
explored
the
possibilities
of
agreement
on
critical
issues
that
jeopardize
the
peace
the
july
meeting
of
heads
of
government
held
out
promise
to
the
world
of
moderation
in
the
bitterness
of
word
and
action
which
tends
to
generate
conflict
and
war
all
were
in
agreement
that
a
nuclear
war
would
be
an
intolerable
disaster
which
must
not
be
permitted
to
occur
but
in
october
when
the
foreign
ministers
met
again
the
results
demonstrated
conclusively
that
the
soviet
leaders
are
not
yet
willing
to
create
the
indispensable
conditions
for
a
secure
and
lasting
peace
nevertheless
it
is
clear
that
the
conflict
between
international
communism
and
freedom
has
taken
on
a
new
complexion
we
know
the
communist
leaders
have
often
practiced
the
tactics
of
retreat
and
zigzag
we
know
that
soviet
and
chinese
communism
still
poses
a
serious
threat
to
the
free
world
and
in
the
middle
east
recent
soviet
moves
are
hardly
compatible
with
the
reduction
of
international
tension
yet
communist
tactics
against
the
free
nations
have
shifted
in
emphasis
from
reliance
on
violence
and
the
threat
of
violence
to
reliance
on
division
enticement
and
duplicity
we
must
be
well
prepared
to
meet
the
current
tactics
which
pose
a
dangerous
though
less
obvious
threat
at
the
same
time
our
policy
must
be
dynamic
as
well
as
flexible
designed
primarily
to
forward
the
achievement
of
our
own
objectives
rather
than
to
meet
each
shift
and
change
on
the
communist
front
we
must
act
in
the
firm
assurance
that
the
fruits
of
freedom
are
more
attractive
and
desirable
to
mankind
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
than
the
record
of
communism
in
the
face
of
communist
military
power
we
must
of
course
continue
to
maintain
an
effective
system
of
collective
security
this
involves
two
thingsa
system
which
gives
clear
warning
that
armed
aggression
will
be
met
by
joint
action
of
the
free
nations
and
deterrent
military
power
to
make
that
warning
effective
moreover
the
awesome
power
of
the
atom
must
be
made
to
serve
as
a
guardian
of
the
free
community
and
of
the
peace
in
the
last
year
the
free
world
has
seen
major
gains
for
the
system
of
collective
security
the
accession
to
the
north
atlantic
treaty
organization
and
western
european
union
of
the
sovereign
federal
german
republic
the
developing
cooperation
under
the
southeast
asia
collective
defense
treaty
and
the
formation
in
the
middle
east
of
the
baghdad
pact
among
turkey
iraq
iran
pakistan
and
the
united
kingdom
in
our
own
hemisphere
the
interamerican
system
has
continued
to
show
its
vitality
in
maintaining
peace
and
a
common
approach
to
world
problems
we
now
have
security
pacts
with
more
than
other
nations
in
the
pursuit
of
our
national
purposes
we
have
been
steadfast
in
our
support
of
the
united
nations
now
entering
its
second
decade
with
a
wider
membership
and
everincreasing
influence
and
usefulness
in
the
release
of
our
fifteen
fliers
from
communist
china
an
essential
prelude
was
the
world
opinion
mobilized
by
the
general
assembly
which
condemned
their
imprisonment
and
demanded
their
liberation
the
successful
atomic
energy
conference
held
in
geneva
under
united
nations
auspices
and
our
atoms
for
peace
program
have
been
practical
steps
toward
the
worldwide
use
of
this
new
energy
source
our
sponsorship
of
such
use
has
benefited
our
relations
with
other
countries
active
negotiations
are
now
in
progress
to
create
an
international
agency
to
foster
peaceful
uses
of
atomic
energy
during
the
past
year
the
crucial
problem
of
disarmament
has
moved
to
the
forefront
of
practical
political
endeavor
at
geneva
i
declared
the
readiness
of
the
united
states
to
exchange
blueprints
of
the
military
establishments
of
our
nation
and
the
ussr
to
be
confirmed
by
reciprocal
aerial
reconnaissance
by
this
means
i
felt
mutual
suspicions
could
be
allayed
and
an
atmosphere
developed
in
which
negotiations
looking
toward
limitation
of
arms
would
have
improved
chances
of
success
in
the
united
nations
subcommittee
on
disarmament
last
fall
this
proposal
was
explored
and
the
united
states
also
declared
itself
willing
to
include
reciprocal
ground
inspection
of
key
points
by
the
overwhelming
vo
te
of
to
the
united
nations
on
december
endorsed
these
proposals
and
gave
them
a
top
priority
thereby
the
issue
is
placed
squarely
before
the
bar
of
world
opinion
we
shall
persevere
in
seeking
a
general
reduction
of
armaments
under
effective
inspection
and
control
which
are
essential
safeguards
to
ensure
reciprocity
and
protect
the
security
of
all
in
the
coming
year
much
remains
to
be
done
while
maintaining
our
military
deterrent
we
must
intensify
our
efforts
to
achieve
a
just
peace
in
asia
we
shall
continue
to
give
help
to
nations
struggling
to
maintain
their
freedom
against
the
threat
of
communist
coercion
or
subversion
in
europe
we
shall
endeavor
to
increase
not
only
the
military
strength
of
the
north
atlantic
alliance
but
also
its
political
cohesion
and
unity
of
purpose
we
shall
give
such
assistance
as
is
feasible
to
the
recently
renewed
effort
of
western
european
nations
to
achieve
a
greater
measure
of
integration
such
as
in
the
field
of
peaceful
uses
of
atomic
energy
in
the
near
east
we
shall
spare
no
effort
in
seeking
to
promote
a
fair
solution
of
the
tragic
dispute
between
the
arab
states
and
israel
all
of
whom
we
want
as
our
friends
the
united
states
is
ready
to
do
its
part
to
assure
enduring
peace
in
that
area
we
hope
that
both
sides
will
make
the
contributions
necessary
to
achieve
that
purpose
in
latin
america
we
shall
continue
to
cooperate
vigorously
in
trade
and
other
measures
designed
to
assist
economic
progress
in
the
area
strong
economic
ties
are
an
essential
element
in
our
free
world
partnership
increasing
trade
and
investment
help
all
of
us
prosper
together
gratifying
progress
has
been
made
in
this
direction
most
recently
by
the
threeyear
extension
of
our
trade
agreements
legislation
i
most
earnestly
request
that
the
congress
approve
our
membership
in
the
organization
for
trade
cooperation
which
would
assist
the
carrying
out
of
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
to
which
we
have
been
a
party
since
our
membership
in
the
otc
will
provide
the
most
effective
and
expeditious
means
for
removing
discriminations
and
restrictions
against
american
exports
and
in
making
our
trade
agreements
truly
reciprocal
united
states
membership
in
the
organization
will
evidence
our
continuing
desire
to
cooperate
in
promoting
an
expanded
trade
among
the
free
nations
thus
the
organization
as
proposed
is
admirably
suited
to
our
own
interests
and
to
those
of
likeminded
nations
in
working
for
steady
expansion
of
trade
and
closer
economic
cooperation
being
strictly
an
administrative
entity
the
organization
for
trade
cooperation
cannot
of
course
alter
the
control
by
congress
of
the
tariff
import
and
customs
policies
of
the
united
states
we
need
to
encourage
investment
overseas
by
avoiding
unfair
tax
duplications
and
to
foster
foreign
trade
by
further
simplification
and
improvement
of
our
customs
legislation
we
must
sustain
and
fortify
our
mutual
security
program
because
the
conditions
of
poverty
and
unrest
in
less
developed
areas
make
their
people
a
special
target
of
international
communism
there
is
a
need
to
help
them
achieve
the
economic
growth
and
stability
necessary
to
preserve
their
independence
against
communist
threats
and
enticements
in
order
that
our
friends
may
better
achieve
the
greater
strength
that
is
our
common
goal
they
need
assurance
of
continuity
in
economic
assistance
for
development
projects
and
programs
which
we
approve
and
which
require
a
period
of
years
for
planning
and
completion
accordingly
i
ask
congress
to
grant
limited
authority
to
make
longerterm
commitments
for
assistance
to
such
projects
to
be
fulfilled
from
appropriations
to
be
made
in
future
fiscal
years
these
various
steps
will
powerfully
strengthen
the
economic
foundation
of
our
foreign
policy
together
with
constructive
action
abroad
they
will
maintain
the
present
momentum
toward
general
economic
progress
and
vitality
of
the
free
world
in
all
things
change
is
the
inexorable
law
of
life
in
much
of
the
world
the
ferment
of
change
is
working
strongly
but
grave
injustices
are
still
uncorrected
we
must
not
by
any
sanction
of
ours
help
to
perpetuate
these
wrongs
i
have
particularly
in
mind
the
oppressive
division
of
the
german
people
the
bondage
of
millions
elsewhere
and
the
exclusion
of
japan
from
united
nations
membership
we
shall
keep
these
injustices
in
the
forefront
of
human
consciousness
and
seek
to
maintain
the
pressure
of
world
opinion
to
fight
these
vast
wrongs
in
the
interest
both
of
justice
and
secure
peace
injustice
thrives
on
ignorance
because
an
understanding
of
the
truth
about
america
is
one
of
our
most
powerful
forces
i
am
recommending
a
substantial
increase
in
budgetary
support
of
the
united
states
information
agency
the
sum
of
our
international
effort
should
be
this
the
waging
of
peace
with
as
much
resourcefulness
with
as
great
a
sense
of
dedication
and
urgency
as
we
have
ever
mustered
in
defense
of
our
country
in
time
of
war
in
this
effort
our
weapon
is
not
force
our
weapons
are
the
principles
and
ideas
embodied
in
our
historic
traditions
applied
with
the
same
vigor
that
in
the
past
made
america
a
living
promise
of
freedom
for
all
mankind
to
accomplish
these
vital
tasks
all
of
us
should
be
concerned
with
the
strength
effectiveness
and
morale
of
our
state
department
and
our
foreign
service
another
guide
in
the
preparation
of
the
administrations
program
is
the
constant
improvement
of
our
national
security
because
peace
is
the
keystone
of
our
national
policy
our
defense
program
emphasizes
an
effective
flexible
type
of
power
calculated
to
deter
or
repulse
any
aggression
and
to
preserve
the
peace
short
of
war
we
have
never
had
military
strength
better
adapted
to
our
needs
with
improved
readiness
for
emergency
use
the
maintenance
of
this
strong
military
capability
for
the
indefinite
future
will
continue
to
call
for
a
large
share
of
our
national
budget
our
military
programs
must
meet
the
needs
of
today
to
build
less
would
expose
the
nation
to
aggression
to
build
excessively
under
the
influence
of
fear
could
defeat
our
purposes
and
impair
or
destroy
the
very
freedom
and
economic
system
our
military
defenses
are
designed
to
protect
we
have
improved
the
effectiveness
and
combat
readiness
of
our
forces
by
developing
and
making
operational
new
weapons
and
by
integrating
the
latest
scientific
developments
including
new
atomic
weapons
into
our
military
plans
we
continue
to
push
the
production
of
the
most
modern
military
aircraft
the
development
of
longrange
missiles
has
been
on
an
accelerated
basis
for
some
time
we
are
moving
as
rapidly
as
practicable
toward
nuclearpowered
aircraft
and
ships
combat
capability
especially
in
terms
of
firepower
has
been
substantially
increased
we
have
made
the
adjustments
in
personnel
permitted
by
the
cessation
of
the
korean
war
the
buildup
of
our
allies
and
the
introduction
of
new
weapons
the
services
are
all
planning
realistically
on
a
longterm
basis
to
strengthen
our
continental
defenses
the
united
states
and
canada
in
the
closest
cooperation
have
substantially
augmented
early
warning
networks
great
progress
is
being
made
in
extending
surveillance
of
the
arctic
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
approaches
to
north
america
in
the
last
analysis
our
real
strength
lies
in
the
caliber
of
the
men
and
women
in
our
armed
forces
active
and
reserve
much
has
been
done
to
attract
and
hold
capable
military
personnel
but
more
needs
to
be
done
this
year
i
renew
my
request
of
last
year
for
legislation
to
provide
proper
medical
care
for
military
dependents
and
a
more
equitable
survivors
benefit
program
the
administration
will
prepare
additional
recommendations
designed
to
achieve
the
same
objectives
including
career
incentives
for
medical
and
dental
officers
and
nurses
and
increases
in
the
proportion
of
regular
officers
closely
related
to
the
mission
of
the
defense
department
is
the
task
of
the
federal
civil
defense
administration
a
particular
point
of
relationship
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
key
to
civil
defense
is
the
expanded
continental
defense
program
including
the
distant
early
warning
system
our
federal
civil
defense
authorities
have
made
progress
in
their
program
and
now
comprehensive
studies
are
being
conducted
jointly
by
the
federal
civil
defense
administration
the
states
and
critical
target
cities
to
determine
the
best
procedures
that
can
be
adopted
in
case
of
an
atomic
attack
we
must
strengthen
federal
assistance
to
the
states
and
cities
in
devising
the
most
effective
common
defense
we
have
a
broad
and
diversified
mobilization
base
we
have
the
facilities
materials
skills
and
knowledge
rapidly
to
expand
the
production
of
things
we
need
for
our
defense
whenever
they
are
required
but
mobilization
base
requirements
change
with
changing
technology
and
strategy
we
must
maintain
flexibility
to
meet
new
requirements
i
am
requesting
therefore
that
the
congress
once
again
extend
the
defense
production
act
of
great
importance
to
our
nations
security
is
a
continuing
alertness
to
internal
subversive
activity
within
or
without
our
government
this
administration
will
not
relax
its
efforts
to
deal
forthrightly
and
vigorously
in
protection
of
this
government
and
its
citizens
against
subversion
at
the
same
time
fully
protecting
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
citizens
a
third
objective
of
the
administration
is
fiscal
integrity
a
public
office
is
indeed
a
public
trust
none
of
its
aspects
is
more
demanding
than
the
proper
management
of
the
public
finances
i
refer
now
not
only
to
the
indispensable
virtues
of
plain
honesty
and
trustworthiness
but
also
to
the
prudent
effective
and
conscientious
use
of
tax
money
i
refer
also
to
the
attitude
of
mind
that
makes
efficient
and
economical
service
to
the
people
a
watchword
in
our
government
over
the
long
term
a
balanced
budget
is
a
sure
index
to
thrifty
managementin
a
home
in
a
business
or
in
the
federal
government
when
achievement
of
a
balanced
budget
is
for
long
put
off
in
a
business
or
home
bankruptcy
is
the
result
but
in
similar
circumstances
a
government
resorts
to
inflation
of

the
money
supply
this
inevitably
results
in
depreciation
of
the
value
of
the
money
and
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
every
investment
in
personal
security
is
threatened
by
this
process
of
inflation
and
the
real
values
of
the
peoples
savings
whether
in
the
form
of
insurance
bonds
pension
and
retirement
funds
or
savings
accounts
are
thereby
shriveled
we
have
made
long
strides
these
past
three
years
in
bringing
our
federal
finances
under
control
the
deficit
for
fiscal
year
was
almost
billion
dollars
larger
deficits
seemed
certaindeficits
which
would
have
depreciated
the
value
of
the
dollar
and
pushed
the
cost
of
living
still
higher
but
government
waste
and
extravagance
were
searched
out
nonessential
activities
were
dropped
government
expenses
were
carefully
scrutinized
total
spending
was
cut
by
billion
dollars
below
the
amount
planned
by
the
previous
administration
for
the
fiscal
year
this
made
possibleand
it
was
appropriate
in
the
existing
circumstances
of
transition
to
a
peacetime
economythe
largest
tax
cut
in
any
year
in
our
history
almost
billion
dollars
were
released
and
every
taxpayer
in
the
country
benefited
almost
twothirds
of
the
savings
went
directly
to
individuals
this
tax
cut
also
helped
to
build
up
the
economy
to
make
jobs
in
industry
and
to
increase
the
production
of
the
many
things
desired
to
improve
the
scale
of
living
for
the
great
majority
of
americans
the
strong
expansion
of
the
economy
coupled
with
a
constant
care
for
efficiency
in
government
operations
and
an
alert
guard
against
waste
and
duplication
has
brought
us
to
a
prospective
balance
between
income
and
expenditure
this
is
being
done
while
we
continue
to
strengthen
our
military
security
i
expect
the
budget
to
be
in
balance
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
i
shall
propose
a
balanced
budget
for
the
next
fiscal
year
ending
june
but
the
balance
we
are
seeking
cannot
be
accomplished
without
the
continuing
everyday
effort
of
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
to
keep
expenditures
under
control
it
will
also
be
necessary
to
continue
all
of
the
present
excise
taxes
without
any
reduction
and
the
corporation
income
taxes
at
their
present
rates
for
another
year
beyond
next
april
st
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
our
present
tax
level
is
very
burdensome
and
in
the
interest
of
long
term
and
continuous
economic
growth
should
be
reduced
when
we
prudently
can
it
is
essential
in
the
sound
management
of
the
governments
finances
that
we
be
mindful
of
our
enormous
national
debt
and
of
the
obligation
we
have
toward
future
americans
to
reduce
that
debt
whenever
we
can
appropriately
do
so
under
conditions
of
high
peacetime
prosperity
such
as
now
exist
we
can
never
justify
going
further
into
debt
to
give
ourselves
a
tax
cut
at
the
expense
of
our
children
so
in
the
present
state
of
our
financial
affairs
i
earnestly
believe
that
a
tax
cut
can
be
deemed
justifiable
only
when
it
will
not
unbalance
the
budget
a
budget
which
makes
provision
for
some
reduction
even
though
modest
in
our
national
debt
in
this
way
we
can
best
maintain
fiscal
integrity
a
fourth
aim
of
our
program
is
to
foster
a
strong
economy
our
competitive
enterprise
system
depends
on
the
energy
of
free
human
beings
limited
by
prudent
restraints
in
law
using
free
markets
to
plan
organize
and
distribute
production
and
spurred
by
the
prospect
of
reward
for
successful
effort
this
system
has
developed
our
resources
it
has
marvelously
expanded
our
productive
capacity
against
the
record
of
all
other
economic
systems
devised
through
the
ages
this
competitive
system
has
proved
the
most
creative
user
of
human
skills
in
the
development
of
physical
resources
and
the
richest
rewarder
of
human
effort
this
is
still
true
in
this
era
when
improved
living
standards
and
rising
national
requirements
are
accompanied
by
swift
advances
in
technology
and
rapid
obsolescence
in
machines
and
methods
typical
of
these
are
the
strides
made
in
construction
of
plants
to
produce
electrical
energy
from
atomic
power
and
of
laboratories
and
installations
for
the
application
of
this
new
force
in
industry
agriculture
and
the
healing
arts
these
developments
make
it
imperativeto
assure
effective
functioning
of
our
enterprise
systemthat
the
federal
government
concern
itself
with
certain
broad
areas
of
our
economic
life
most
important
of
these
is
agriculture
our
farm
people
are
not
sharing
as
they
should
in
the
general
prosperity
they
alone
of
all
major
groups
have
seen
their
incomes
decline
rather
than
rise
they
are
caught
between
two
millstonesrising
production
costs
and
declining
prices
such
harm
to
a
part
of
the
national
economy
so
vitally
important
to
everyone
is
of
great
concern
to
us
all
no
other
resource
is
so
indispensable
as
the
land
that
feeds
and
clothes
us
no
group
is
more
fundamental
to
our
national
life
than
our
farmers
in
successful
prosecution
of
the
war
the
nation
called
for
the
utmost
effort
of
its
farmers
their
response
was
superb
their
contribution
unsurpassed
farmers
are
not
now
to
be
blamed
for
the
mountainous
pricedepressing
surpluses
produced
in
response
to
wartime
policies
and
laws
that
were
too
long
continued
war
markets
are
not
the
markets
of
peacetime
failure
to
recognize
that
basic
fact
by
a
timely
adjustment
of
wartime
legislation
brought
its
inevitable
result
in
peacetimesurpluses
lower
prices
and
lower
incomes
for
our
farmers
the
dimensions
of
government
responsibility
are
as
broad
and
complex
as
the
farm
problem
itself
we
are
here
concerned
not
only
with
our
essential
continuing
supplies
of
food
and
fiber
but
also
with
a
way
of
life
both
are
indispensable
to
the
wellbeing
and
strength
of
the
nation
consideration
of
these
matters
must
be
above
and
beyond
politics
our
national
farm
policy
so
vital
to
the
welfare
of
farm
people
and
all
of
us
must
not
become
a
field
for
political
warfare
too
much
is
at
stake
our
farm
people
expect
of
us
who
have
responsibility
for
their
government
understanding
of
their
problems
and
the
will
to
help
solve
them
our
objective
must
be
to
help
bring
production
into
balance
with
existing
and
new
markets
at
prices
that
yield
farmers
a
return
for
their
work
in
line
with
what
other
americans
get
to
reach
this
goal
deepseated
problems
must
be
subjected
to
a
steppedup
attack
there
is
no
single
easy
solution
rather
there
must
be
a
manysided
assault
on
the
stubborn
problems
of
surpluses
prices
costs
and
markets
and
a
steady
persistent
imaginative
advance
in
the
relationship
between
farmers
and
their
government
in
a
few
days
by
special
message
i
shall
lay
before
the
congress
my
detailed
recommendations
for
new
steps
that
should
be
taken
promptly
to
speed
the
transition
in
agriculture
and
thus
assist
our
farmers
to
achieve
their
fair
share
of
the
national
income
basic
to
this
program
will
be
a
new
attack
on
the
surplus
problemfor
even
the
bestconceived
farm
program
cannot
work
under
a
multibillion
dollar
weight
of
accumulated
stocks
i
shall
urge
authorization
of
a
soil
bank
program
to
alleviate
the
problem
of
diverted
acres
and
an
overexpanded
agricultural
plant
this
will
include
an
acreage
reserve
to
reduce
current
and
accumulated
surpluses
of
crops
in
most
serious
difficulty
and
a
conservation
reserve
to
achieve
other
needed
adjustments
in
the
use
of
agricultural
resources
i
shall
urge
measures
to
strengthen
our
surplus
disposal
activities
i
shall
propose
measures
to
strengthen
individual
commodity
programs
to
remove
controls
where
possible
to
reduce
carryovers
and
to
stop
further
accumulations
of
surpluses
i
shall
ask
the
congress
to
provide
substantial
new
funds
for
an
expanded
drive
on
the
research
front
to
develop
new
markets
new
crops
and
new
uses
the
rural
development
program
to
better
the
lot
of
lowincome
farm
families
deserves
full
congressional
support
the
great
plains
program
must
go
forward
vigorously
advances
on
these
and
other
fronts
will
pull
down
the
pricedepressing
surpluses
and
raise
farm
income
in
this
time
of
testing
in
agriculture
we
should
all
together
regardless
of
party
carry
forward
resolutely
with
a
sound
and
forward
looking
program
on
which
farm
people
may
confidently
depend
now
and
for
years
to
come
i
shall
briefly
mention
four
other
subjects
directly
related
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
economy
preliminary
to
their
fuller
discussion
in
the
economic
report
and
later
communications
resources
conservation
i
wish
to
reemphasize
the
critical
importance
of
the
wise
use
and
conservation
of
our
great
natural
resources
of
land
forests
minerals
and
water
and
their
longrange
development
consistent
with
our
agricultural
policy
water
in
particular
now
plays
an
increasing
role
in
industrial
processes
in
the
irrigation
of
land
in
electric
power
as
well
as
in
domestic
uses
at
the
same
time
it
has
the
potential
of
damage
and
disaster
a
comprehensive
legislative
program
for
water
conservation
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
during
the
session
the
development
of
our
water
resources
cannot
be
accomplished
overnight
the
need
is
such
that
we
must
make
faster
progress
and
without
delay
therefore
i
strongly
recommend
that
action
be
taken
at
this
session
on
such
wholly
federal
projects
as
the
colorado
river
storage
project
and
the
fryingpanarkansas
project
on
the
john
day
partnership
project
and
other
projects
which
provide
for
cooperative
action
between
the
federal
government
and
nonfederal
interests
and
on
legislation
which
makes
provision
for
federal
participation
in
small
projects
under
the
primary
sponsorship
of
agencies
of
state
and
local
government
during
the
past
year
the
areas
of
our
national
parks
have
been
expanded
and
new
wildlife
refuges
have
been
created
the
visits
of
our
people
to
the
parks
have
increased
much
more
rapidly
than
have
the
facilities
to
care
for
them
the
administration
will
submit
recommendations
to
provide
more
adequate
facilities
to
keep
abreast
of
the
increasing
interest
of
our
people
in
the
great
outdoors
disaster
assistance
a
modern
community
is
a
complex
combination
of
skills
specialized
buildings
machines
communications
and
homes
most
importantly

it
involves
human
lives
disaster
in
many
formsby
flood
frost
high
winds
for
instancecan
destroy
on
a
massive
scale
in
a
few
hours
the
labor
of
many
years
through
the
past
three
years
the
administration
has
repeatedly
moved
into
action
wherever
disaster
struck
the
extent
of
state
participation
in
relief
activities
however
has
been
far
from
uniform
and
in
many
cases
has
been
either
inadequate
or
nonexistent
disaster
assistance
legislation
requires
overhauling
and
an
experimental
program
of
flooddamage
indemnities
should
be
undertaken
the
administration
will
make
detailed
recommendations
on
these
subjects
area
redevelopment
we
must
help
deal
with
the
pockets
of
chronic
unemployment
that
here
and
there
mar
the
nations
general
industrial
prosperity
economic
changes
in
recent
years
have
been
often
so
rapid
and
farreaching
that
areas
committed
to
a
single
local
resource
or
industrial
activity
have
found
themselves
temporarily
deprived
of
their
markets
and
their
livelihood
such
conditions
mean
severe
hardship
for
thousands
of
people
as
the
slow
process
of
adaptation
to
new
circumstances
goes
on
this
process
can
be
speeded
up
last
year
i
authorized
a
major
study
of
the
problem
to
find
additional
steps
to
supplement
existing
programs
for
the
redevelopment
of
areas
of
chronic
unemployment
recommendations
will
be
submitted
designed
to
supplement
with
federal
technical
and
loan
assistance
local
efforts
to
get
on
with
this
vital
job
improving
such
communities
must
of
course
remain
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
people
living
there
and
of
their
states
but
a
soundly
conceived
federal
partnership
program
can
be
of
real
assistance
to
them
in
their
efforts
highway
legislation
legislation
to
provide
a
modern
interstate
highway
system
is
even
more
urgent
this
year
than
last
for
months
have
now
passed
in
which
we
have
fallen
further
behind
in
road
construction
needed
for
the
personal
safety
the
general
prosperity
the
national
security
of
the
american
people
during
the
year
the
number
of
motor
vehicles
has
increased
from
to
million
during
the
past
year
over
persons
lost
their
lives
in
highway
accidents
while
the
fearful
toll
of
injuries
and
property
damage
has
gone
on
unabated
in
my
message
of
february
i
urged
that
measures
be
taken
to
complete
the
vital
mile
interstate
system
over
a
period
of
years
at
an
estimated
federal
cost
of
approximately
billion
dollars
no
program
was
adopted
if
we
are
ever
to
solve
our
mounting
traffic
problem
the
whole
interstate
system
must
be
authorized
as
one
project
to
be
completed
approximately
within
the
specified
time
only
in
this
way
can
industry
efficiently
gear
itself
to
the
job
ahead
only
in
this
way
can
the
required
planning
and
engineering
be
accomplished
without
the
confusion
and
waste
unavoidable
a
piecemeal
approach
furthermore
as
i
pointed
out
last
year
the
pressing
nature
of
this
problem
must
not
lead
us
to
solutions
outside
the
bounds
of
sound
fiscal
management
as
in
the
case
of
other
pressing
problems
there
must
be
an
adequate
plan
of
financing
to
continue
the
drastically
needed
improvement
in
other
national
highway
systems
i
recommend
the
continuation
of
the
federal
aid
highway
program
aside
from
agriculture
and
the
four
subjects
specifically
mentioned
an
integral
part
of
our
efforts
to
foster
a
strong
and
expanding
free
economy
is
keeping
open
the
door
of
opportunity
to
new
and
small
enterprises
checking
monopoly
and
preserving
a
competitive
environment
in
this
past
year
the
steady
improvement
in
the
economic
health
of
small
business
has
reinforced
the
vitality
of
our
competitive
economy
we
shall
continue
to
help
small
business
concerns
to
obtain
access
to
adequate
financing
and
to
competent
counsel
on
management
production
and
marketing
problems
through
measures
already
taken
opportunities
for
smallbusiness
participation
in
government
procurement
programs
including
military
procurement
are
greatly
improved
the
effectiveness
of
these
measures
will
become
increasingly
apparent
we
shall
continue
to
make
certain
that
small
business
has
a
fair
opportunity
to
compete
and
has
an
economic
environment
in
which
it
may
prosper
in
my
message
last
year
i
referred
to
the
appointment
of
an
advisory
committee
to
appraise
and
report
to
me
on
the
deficiencies
as
well
as
the
effectiveness
of
existing
federal
transportation
policies
i
have
commended
the
fundamental
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
committees
report
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
congress
give
prompt
attention
to
the
committees
proposals
essential
to
a
prosperous
economic
environment
for
all
business
small
and
largefor
agriculture
and
industry
and
commerceis
efficiency
in
government
to
that
end
exhaustive
studies
of
the
entire
governmental
structure
were
made
by
the
commission
on
intergovernmental
relations
and
the
commission
on
the
organization
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
governmentthe
reports
of
these
commissions
are
now
under
intensive
review
and
already
in
the
process
of
implementation
in
important
areas
one
specific
and
most
vital
governmental
function
merits
study
and
action
by
the
congress
as
part
of
our
program
of
promoting
efficiency
in
government
and
getting
the
fiscal
situation
in
hand
the
post
office
department
in
the
past
three
years
has
been
overhauled
nearly
one
thousand
new
post
offices
have
been
provided
financial
practices
have
been
modernized
and
transportation
and
operating
methods
are
being
constantly
improved
a
new
wage
and
incentive
plan
for
the
half
million
postal
employees
has
been
established
never
before
has
the
postal
system
handled
so
much
mail
so
quickly
and
so
economically
the
post
office
department
faces
two
serious
problems
first
much
of
its
physical
plantpost
offices
and
other
buildingsis
obsolete
and
inadequate
many
new
buildings
and
the
modernization
of
present
ones
are
essential
if
we
are
to
have
improved
mail
service
the
second
problem
is
the
departments
fiscal
plight
it
now
faces
an
annual
deficit
of
onehalf
billion
dollars
recommendations
on
postal
facilities
and
on
additional
postal
revenues
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
a
final
consideration
in
our
program
planning
is
the
response
to
human
concerns
a
fundamental
belief
shines
forth
in
this
republic
we
believe
in
the
worth
and
dignity
of
the
individual
we
know
that
if
we
are
to
govern
ourselves
wiselyin
the
tradition
of
americawe
must
have
the
opportunity
to
develop
our
individual
capacities
to
the
utmost
to
fulfill
the
individuals
aspirations
in
the
american
way
of
life
good
education
is
fundamental
good
education
is
the
outgrowth
of
good
homes
good
communities
good
churches
and
good
schools
today
our
schools
face
pressing
problemsproblems
which
will
not
yield
to
swift
and
easy
solutions
or
to
any
single
action
they
will
yield
only
to
a
continuing
active
formed
effort
by
the
people
toward
achieving
better
schools
this
kind
of
effort
has
been
spurred
by
the
thousands
of
conferences
held
in
recent
months
by
half
a
million
citizens
and
educators
in
all
parts
of
the
country
culminating
in
the
white
house
conference
on
education
in
that
conference
some
two
thousand
delegates
broadly
representative
of
the
nation
studied
together
the
problems
of
the
nations
schools
they
concluded
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
must
make
a
greater
effort
through
their
local
state
and
federal
governments
to
improve
the
education
of
our
youth
this
expression
from
the
people
must
now
be
translated
into
action
at
all
levels
of
government
so
far
as
the
federal
share
of
responsibility
is
concerned
i
urge
that
the
congress
move
promptly
to
enact
an
effective
program
of
federal
assistance
to
help
erase
the
existing
deficit
of
school
classrooms
such
a
program
which
should
be
limited
to
a
fiveyear
period
must
operate
to
increase
rather
than
decrease
local
and
state
support
of
schools
and
to
give
the
greatest
help
to
the
states
and
localities
with
the
least
financial
resources
federal
aid
should
in
no
way
jeopardize
the
freedom
of
local
school
systems
there
will
be
presented
to
the
congress
a
recommended
program
of
federal
assistance
for
school
construction
such
a
program
should
be
accompanied
by
action
to
increase
services
to
the
nations
schools
by
the
office
of
education
and
by
legislation
to
provide
continuation
of
payments
to
school
districts
where
federal
activities
have
impaired
the
ability
of
those
districts
to
provide
adequate
schools
under
the
amendments
to
the
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
program
protection
was
extended
to
some
million
additional
workers
and
benefits
were
increased
the
system
now
helps
protect
out
of
american
workers
and
their
families
against
loss
of
income
in
old
age
or
on
the
death
of
the
breadwinner
the
system
is
sound
it
must
be
kept
so
in
developing
improvements
in
the
system
we
must
give
the
most
careful
consideration
to
population
and
social
trends
and
to
fiscal
requirements
with
these
considerations
in
mind
the
administration
will
present
its
recommendations
for
further
expansion
of
coverage
and
other
steps
which
can
be
taken
wisely
at
this
time
other
needs
in
the
area
of
social
welfare
include
increased
child
welfare
services
extension
of
the
program
of
aid
to
dependent
children
intensified
attack
on
juvenile
delinquency
and
special
attention
to
the
problems
of
mentally
retarded
children
the
training
of
more
skilled
workers
for
these
fields
and
the
quest
for
new
knowledge
through
research
in
social
welfare
are
essential
similarly
the
problems
of
our
aged
people
need
our
attention
the
nation
has
made
dramatic
progress
in
conquering
diseaseprogress
of
profound
human
significance
which
can
be
greatly
accelerated
by
an
intensified
effort
in
medical
research
a
wellsupported
wellbalanced
program
of
research
including
basic
research
can
open
new
frontiers
of
knowledge
prevent
and
relieve
suffering
and
prolong
life
accordingly
i
shall
recommend
a
substantial
increase
in
federal
funds
for
the
support
of
such
a
program
as
an
integral
part
of
this
effort
i
shall
recommend
a
new
plan
to
aid
construction
of
nonfederal
medical
research
and
t
eaching
facilities
and
to
help
provide
more
adequate
support
for
the
training
of
medical
research
manpower
finally
we
must
aid
in
cushioning
the
heavy
and
rising
costs
of
illness
and
hospitalization
to
individuals
and
families
provision
should
be
made
by
federal
reinsurance
or
otherwise
to
foster
extension
of
voluntary
health
insurance
coverage
to
many
more
persons
especially
older
persons
and
those
in
rural
areas
plans
should
be
evolved
to
improve
protection
against
the
costs
of
prolonged
or
severe
illness
these
measures
will
help
reduce
the
dollar
barrier
between
many
americans
and
the
benefits
of
modern
medical
care
the
administration
health
program
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
in
detail
the
response
of
government
to
human
concerns
embraces
of
course
other
measures
of
broad
public
interest
and
of
special
interest
to
our
working
men
and
women
the
need
still
exists
for
improvement
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
the
recommendations
i
submitted
to
the
congress
last
year
take
into
account
not
only
the
interests
of
labor
and
management
but
also
the
public
welfare
the
needed
amendments
should
be
enacted
without
further
delay
we
must
also
carry
forward
the
job
of
improving
the
wagehour
law
last
year
i
requested
the
congress
to
broaden
the
coverage
of
the
minimum
wage
i
repeat
that
recommendation
and
i
pledge
the
full
resources
of
the
executive
branch
to
assist
the
congress
in
finding
ways
to
attain
this
goal
moreover
as
requested
last
year
legislation
should
be
passed
to
clarify
and
strengthen
the
eighthour
laws
for
the
benefit
of
workers
who
are
subject
to
federal
wage
standards
on
federal
and
federally
assisted
construction
and
other
public
works
the
administration
will
shortly
propose
legislation
to
assure
adequate
disclosure
of
the
financial
affairs
of
each
employee
pension
and
welfare
plan
and
to
afford
substantial
protection
to
their
beneficiaries
in
accordance
with
the
objectives
outlined
in
my
message
of
january
occupational
safety
still
demands
attention
as
i
pointed
out
last
year
and
legislation
to
improve
the
longshoremens
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act
is
still
needed
the
improvement
of
the
district
of
columbia
unemployment
insurance
law
and
legislation
to
provide
employees
in
the
district
with
nonoccupational
disability
insurance
are
no
less
necessary
now
than
months
ago
legislation
to
apply
the
principle
of
equal
pay
for
equal
work
without
discrimination
because
of
sex
is
a
matter
of
simple
justice
i
earnestly
urge
the
congress
to
move
swiftly
to
implement
these
needed
labor
measures
in
the
field
of
human
needs
we
must
carry
forward
the
housing
program
which
is
contributing
so
greatly
to
the
wellbeing
of
our
people
and
the
prosperity
of
our
economy
home
ownership
is
now
advanced
to
the
point
where
almost
three
of
every
five
families
in
our
cities
towns
and
suburbs
own
the
houses
they
live
in
for
the
housing
program
most
of
the
legislative
authority
already
exists
however
a
firm
program
of
public
housing
is
essential
until
the
private
building
industry
has
found
ways
to
provide
more
adequate
housing
for
lowincome
families
the
administration
will
propose
authority
to
contract
for
thousand
additional
public
housing
units
in
each
of
the
next
fiscal
years
for
communities
which
will
participate
in
an
integrated
attack
on
slums
and
blight
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
growing
number
of
older
people
several
amendments
to
the
national
housing
act
will
be
proposed
to
assist
the
private
homebuilding
industry
as
well
as
charitable
and
nonprofit
organizations
with
so
large
a
number
of
the
american
people
desiring
to
modernize
and
improve
existing
dwellings
i
recommend
that
the
title
program
for
permanent
improvements
in
the
home
be
liberalized
i
recommend
increases
in
the
general
fha
mortgage
insurance
authority
the
extension
of
the
fha
military
housing
program
an
increase
in
the
authorization
for
urban
planning
grants
in
the
special
assistance
authority
of
the
federal
national
mortgage
association
and
continued
support
of
the
college
housing
program
in
a
way
that
will
not
discourage
private
capital
from
helping
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
colleges
the
legislation
i
have
recommended
for
workers
in
private
industry
should
be
accompanied
by
a
parallel
effort
for
the
welfare
of
government
employees
we
have
accomplished
much
in
this
field
including
a
contributory
life
insurance
program
equitable
pay
increases
and
a
fringe
benefits
program
covering
many
needed
personnel
policy
changes
from
improved
premium
pay
to
a
meaningful
incentive
award
program
additional
personnel
management
legislation
is
needed
in
this
session
as
i
stated
last
year
an
executive
pay
increase
is
essential
to
efficient
governmental
management
such
an
increase
together
with
needed
adjustments
in
the
pay
for
the
top
career
positions
is
also
necessary
to
the
equitable
completion
of
the
federal
pay
program
initiated
last
year
other
legislation
will
be
proposed
including
legislation
for
prepaid
group
health
insurance
for
employees
and
their
dependents
and
to
effect
major
improvements
in
the
civil
service
retirement
system
all
of
us
share
a
continuing
concern
for
those
who
have
served
this
nation
in
the
armed
forces
the
commission
on
veterans
pensions
is
at
this
time
conducting
a
study
of
the
entire
field
of
veterans
benefits
and
will
soon
submit
proposed
improvements
we
are
proud
of
the
progress
our
people
have
made
in
the
field
of
civil
rights
in
executive
branch
operations
throughout
the
nation
elimination
of
discrimination
and
segregation
is
all
but
completed
progress
is
also
being
made
among
contractors
engaged
in
furnishing
government
services
and
requirements
every
citizen
now
has
the
opportunity
to
fit
himself
for
and
to
hold
a
position
of
responsibility
in
the
service
of
his
country
in
the
district
of
columbia
through
the
voluntary
cooperation
of
the
people
discrimination
and
segregation
are
disappearing
from
hotels
theaters
restaurants
and
other
facilities
it
is
disturbing
that
in
some
localities
allegations
persist
that
negro
citizens
are
being
deprived
of
their
right
to
vote
and
are
likewise
being
subjected
to
unwarranted
economic
pressures
i
recommend
that
the
substance
of
these
charges
be
thoroughly
examined
by
a
bipartisan
commission
created
by
the
congress
it
is
hoped
that
such
a
commission
will
be
established
promptly
so
that
it
may
arrive
at
findings
which
can
receive
early
consideration
the
stature
of
our
leadership
in
the
free
world
has
increased
through
the
past
three
years
because
we
have
made
more
progress
than
ever
before
in
a
similar
period
to
assure
our
citizens
equality
in
justice
in
opportunity
and
in
civil
rights
we
must
expand
this
effort
on
every
front
we
must
strive
to
have
every
person
judged
and
measured
by
what
he
is
rather
than
by
his
color
race
or
religion
there
will
soon
be
recommended
to
the
congress
a
program
further
to
advance
the
efforts
of
the
government
within
the
area
of
federal
responsibility
to
accomplish
these
objectives
one
particular
challenge
confronts
us
in
the
hawaiian
islands
east
meets
west
to
the
islands
asia
and
europe
and
the
western
hemisphere
all
the
continents
have
contributed
their
peoples
and
their
cultures
to
display
a
unique
example
of
a
community
that
is
a
successful
laboratory
in
human
brotherhood
statehood
supported
by
the
repeatedly
expressed
desire
of
the
islands
people
and
by
our
traditions
would
be
a
shining
example
of
the
american
way
to
the
entire
earth
consequently
i
urgently
request
this
congress
to
grant
statehood
for
hawaii
also
in
harmony
with
the
provisions
i
last
year
communicated
to
the
senate
and
house
committees
on
interior
and
insular
affairs
i
trust
that
progress
toward
statehood
for
alaska
can
be
made
in
this
session
progress
is
constant
toward
full
integration
of
our
indian
citizens
into
normal
community
life
during
the
past
two
years
the
administration
has
provided
school
facilities
for
thousands
of
indian
children
previously
denied
this
opportunity
we
must
continue
to
meet
the
needs
of
increased
numbers
of
indian
children
provision
should
also
be
made
for
the
education
of
adult
indians
whose
schooling
in
earlier
years
was
neglected
in
keeping
with
our
responsibility
of
world
leadership
and
in
our
own
self
interest
i
again
point
out
to
the
congress
the
urgent
need
for
revision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
laws
our
nation
has
always
welcomed
immigrants
to
our
shores
the
wisdom
of
such
a
policy
is
clearly
shown
by
the
fact
that
america
has
been
built
by
immigrants
and
the
descendants
of
immigrants
that
policy
must
be
continued
realistically
with
present
day
conditions
in
mind
i
recommend
that
the
number
of
persons
admitted
to
this
country
annually
be
based
not
on
the
census
but
on
the
latest
the
census
provision
should
be
made
to
allow
for
greater
flexibility
in
the
use
of
quotas
so
if
one
country
does
not
use
its
share
the
vacancies
may
be
made
available
for
the
use
of
qualified
individuals
from
other
countries
the
law
should
be
amended
to
permit
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
attorney
general
to
waive
the
requirements
of
fingerprinting
on
a
reciprocal
basis
for
persons
coming
to
this
country
for
temporary
visits
this
and
other
changes
in
the
law
are
long
overdue
and
should
be
taken
care
of
promptly
detailed
recommendations
for
revision
of
the
immigration
laws
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
i
am
happy
to
report
substantial
progress
in
the
flow
of
immigrants
under
the
refugee
relief
act
of
however
i
again
request
this
congress
to
approve
without
further
delay
the
urgently
needed
amendments
to
that
act
which
i
submitted
in
the
last
session
because
of
the
high
prosperity
in
germany
and
austria
the
number
of
immigrants
from
those
countries
will
be
reduced
this
will
make
available
thousands
of
unfilled
openings
which
i
recommend
be
distributed
to
greece
and
italy
and
to
escapees
from
behind
the
iron
curtain
once
again
i
ask
the
congress
to
join
with
me
in
demonstrating
our
belief
in
the
right
of
suffrage
i
renew
my
request
that
the
principle
of
selfgov
ernment
be
extended
and
the
right
of
suffrage
granted
to
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
conclude
the
vista
before
us
is
bright
the
march
of
science
the
expanding
economy
the
advance
in
collective
security
toward
a
just
peacein
this
threefold
movement
our
people
are
creating
new
standards
by
which
the
future
of
the
republic
may
be
judged
progress
however
will
be
realized
only
as
it
is
more
than
matched
by
a
continuing
growth
in
the
spiritual
strength
of
the
nation
our
dedication
to
moral
values
must
be
complete
in
our
dealings
abroad
and
in
our
relationships
among
ourselves
we
have
singleminded
devotion
to
the
common
good
of
america
never
must
we
forget
that
this
means
the
wellbeing
the
prosperity
the
security
of
all
americans
in
every
walk
of
life
to
the
attainment
of
these
objectives
i
pledge
full
energies
of
the
administration
as
in
the
session
ahead
it
works
on
a
program
for
submission
to
you
the
congress
of
the
united
states

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
congress
first
i
extend
cordial
greetings
to
the
th
congress
we
shall
have
much
to
do
together
i
am
sure
that
we
shall
get
it
doneand
that
we
shall
do
it
in
harmony
and
good
will
at
the
outset
i
believe
it
would
be
well
to
remind
ourselves
of
this
great
fundamental
in
our
national
life
our
common
belief
that
every
human
being
is
divinely
endowed
with
dignity
and
worth
and
inalienable
rights
this
faith
with
its
corollarythat
to
grow
and
flourish
people
must
be
freeshapes
the
interests
and
aspirations
of
every
american
from
this
deep
faith
have
evolved
three
main
purposes
of
our
federal
government
first
to
maintain
justice
and
freedom
among
ourselves
and
to
champion
them
for
others
so
that
we
may
work
effectively
for
enduring
peace
second
to
help
keep
our
economy
vigorous
and
expanding
thus
sustaining
our
international
strength
and
assuring
better
jobs
better
living
better
opportunities
for
every
citizen
and
third
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
human
problems
of
our
people
so
that
every
american
may
have
the
opportunity
to
lead
a
healthy
productive
and
rewarding
life
foremost
among
these
broad
purposes
of
government
is
our
support
of
freedom
justice
and
peace
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
each
of
us
understand
the
true
nature
of
the
struggle
now
taking
place
in
the
world
it
is
not
a
struggle
merely
of
economic
theories
or
of
forms
of
government
or
of
military
power
at
issue
is
the
true
nature
of
man
either
man
is
the
creature
whom
the
psalmist
described
as
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
crowned
with
glory
and
honor
holding
dominion
over
the
works
of
his
creator
or
man
is
a
soulless
animated
machine
to
be
enslaved
used
and
consumed
by
the
state
for
its
own
glorification
it
is
therefore
a
struggle
which
goes
to
the
roots
of
the
human
spirit
and
its
shadow
falls
across
the
long
sweep
of
mans
destiny
this
prize
so
precious
so
fraught
with
ultimate
meaning
is
the
true
object
of
the
contending
forces
in
the
world
in
the
past
year
there
has
been
progress
justifying
hope
both
for
continuing
peace
and
for
the
ultimate
rule
of
freedom
and
justice
in
the
world
free
nations
are
collectively
stronger
than
at
any
time
in
recent
years
just
as
nations
of
this
hemisphere
in
the
historic
caracas
and
rio
conferences
have
closed
ranks
against
imperialistic
communism
and
strengthened
their
economic
ties
so
free
nations
elsewhere
have
forged
new
bonds
of
unity
recent
agreements
between
turkey
and
pakistan
have
laid
a
foundation
for
increased
strength
in
the
middle
east
with
our
understanding
support
egypt
and
britain
yugoslavia
and
italy
britain
and
iran
have
resolved
dangerous
differences
the
security
of
the
mediterranean
has
been
enhanced
by
an
alliance
among
greece
turkey
and
yugoslavia
agreements
in
western
europe
have
paved
the
way
for
unity
to
replace
past
divisions
which
have
undermined
europes
economic
and
military
vitality
the
defense
of
the
west
appears
likely
at
last
to
include
a
free
democratic
germany
participating
as
an
equal
in
the
councils
of
nato
in
asia
and
the
pacific
the
pending
manila
pact
supplements
our
treaties
with
australia
new
zealand
the
philippines
korea
and
japan
and
our
prospective
treaty
with
the
republic
of
china
these
pacts
stand
as
solemn
warning
that
future
military
aggression
and
subversion
against
the
free
nations
of
asia
will
meet
united
response
the
pacific
charter
also
adopted
at
manila
is
a
milestone
in
the
development
of
human
freedom
and
selfgovernment
in
the
pacific
area
under
the
auspices
of
the
united
nations
there
is
promise
of
progress
in
our
countrys
plan
for
the
peaceful
use
of
atomic
energy
finally
today
the
world
is
at
peace
it
is
to
be
sure
an
secure
peace
yet
all
humanity
finds
hope
in
the
simple
fact
that
for
an
appreciable
time
there
has
been
no
active
major
battlefield
on
earth
this
same
fact
inspires
us
to
work
all
the
more
effectively
with
other
nations
for
the
wellbeing
the
freedom
the
dignity
of
every
human
on
earth
these
developments
are
heartening
indeed
and
we
are
hopeful
of
continuing
progress
but
sobering
problems
remain
the
massive
military
machines
and
ambitions
of
the
sovietcommunist
bloc
still
create
uneasiness
in
the
world
all
of
us
are
aware
of
the
continuing
reliance
of
the
soviet
communists
on
military
force
of
the
power
of
their
weapons
of
their
present
resistance
to
realistic
armament
limitation
and
of
their
continuing
effort
to
dominate
or
intimidate
free
nations
on
their
periphery
their
steadily
growing
power
includes
an
increasing
strength
in
nuclear
weapons
this
power
combined
with
the
proclaimed
intentions
of
the
communist
leaders
to
communize
the
world
is
the
threat
confronting
us
today
to
protect
our
nations
and
our
peoples
from
the
catastrophe
of
a
nuclear
holocaust
free
nations
must
maintain
countervailing
military
power
to
persuade
the
communists
of
the
futility
of
seeking
their
ends
through
aggression
if
communist
rulers
understand
that
americas
response
to
aggression
will
be
swift
and
decisivethat
never
shall
we
buy
peace
at
the
expense
of
honor
or
faiththey
will
be
powerfully
deterred
from
launching
a
military
venture
engulfing
their
own
peoples
and
many
others
in
disaster
this
of
course
is
merely
world
stalemate
but
in
this
stalemate
each
of
us
may
and
must
exercise
his
high
duty
to
strive
in
every
honorable
way
for
enduring
peace
the
military
threat
is
but
one
menace
to
our
freedom
and
security
we
must
not
only
deter
aggression
we
must
also
frustrate
the
effort
of
communists
to
gain
their
goals
by
subversion
to
this
end
free
nations
must
maintain
and
reinforce
their
cohesion
their
internal
security
their
political
and
economic
vitality
and
their
faith
in
freedom
in
such
a
world
americas
course
is
dear
we
must
tirelessly
labor
to
make
the
peace
more
just
and
durable
we
must
strengthen
the
collective
defense
under
the
united
nations
charter
and
gird
ourselves
with
sufficient
military
strength
and
productive
capacity
to
discourage
resort
to
war
and
protect
our
nations
vital
interests
we
must
continue
to
support
and
strengthen
the
united
nations
at
this
very
moment
by
vote
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
its
secretarygeneral
is
in
communist
china
on
a
mission
of
deepest
concern
to
all
americans
seeking
the
release
of
our
nevertobeforgotten
american
aviators
and
all
other
united
nations
prisoners
wrongfully
detained
by
the
communist
regime
we
must
also
encourage
the
efforts
being
made
in
the
united
nations
to
limit
armaments
and
to
harness
the
atom
to
peaceful
rise
we
must
expand
international
trade
and
investment
and
assist
friendly
nations
whose
own
best
efforts
are
still
insufficient
to
provide
the
strength
essential
to
the
security
of
the
free
world
we
must
be
willing
to
use
the
processes
of
negotiation
whenever
they
will
advance
the
cause
of
just
and
secure
peace
to
which
the
united
states
and
other
free
nations
are
dedicated
in
respect
to
all
these
matters
we
must
through
a
vigorous
information
program
keep
the
peoples
of
the
world
truthfully
advised
of
our
actions
and
purposes
this
problem
has
been
attacked
with
new
vigor
during
the
past
months
i
urge
that
the
congress
give
its
earnest
consideration
to
the
great
advantages
that
can
accrue
to
our
country
through
the
successful
operations
of
this
program
we
must
also
carry
forward
our
educational
exchange
program
this
sharing
of
knowledge
and
experience
between
our
citizens
and
those
of
free
countries
is
a
powerful
factor
in
the
development
and
maintenance
of
true
partnership
among
free
peoples
to
advance
these
many
efforts
the
congress
must
act
in
this
session
on
appropriations
legislation
and
treaties
today
i
shall
mention
especially
our
foreign
economic
and
military
programs
the
recent
economic
progress
in
many
free
nations
has
been
most
heartening
the
productivity
of
labor
and
the
production
of
goods
and
services
are
increasing
in
everwidening
areas
there
is
a
growing
will
to
improve
the
living
standards
of
all
men
this
progress
is
important
to
all
our
people
it
promises
us
allies
who
are
strong
and
selfreliant
it
promises
a
growing
world
market
for
the
products
of
our
mines
our
factories
and
our
farms
but
only
through
steady
effort
can
we
hope
to
continue
this
progress
barriers
still
impede
trade
and
the
flow
of
capital
needed
to
develop
each
nations
human
and
material
resources
wise
reduction
of
these
barriers
is
a
longterm
objective
of
our
foreign
economic
policya
policy
of
an
evolutionary
and
selective
nature
assuring
broad
benefits
to
our
own
and
other
peoples
we
must
gradually
reduce
certain
tariff
obstacles
to
trade
these
actions
should
of
course
be
accompanied
by
a
similar
lowering
of
trade
barriers
by
other
nations
so
that
we
may
move
steadily
toward
greater
economic
advantage
for
all
we
must
further
simplify
customs
administration
and
procedures
we
must
facilitate
the
flow
of
capital
and
continue
technical
assistance
both
directly
and
through
the
united
nations
to
less
developed
countries
to
strengthen
their
independence
and
raise
their
living
standards
many
another
step
must
be
taken
in
and
among
the
nations
of
the
free
world
to
release
forces
of
private
initiative
in
our
own
nation
these
forces
have
brought
strength
and
prosperity
once
released
they
will
generate
rising
incomes
in
these
other
countries
with
which
to
buy
the
products
of
american
industry
labor
and
agriculture
on
january
by
special
message
i
shall
submit
specific
recommendations
for
carrying
forward
the
legislative
phases
of
our
foreign
economic
policy
our
many
efforts
to
build
a
better
world
include
the
maintenance
of
our
military
strength
this
is
a
vast
undertaking
major
national
security
programs
consume
twothirds
of
the
entire
federal
budget
over
four
million
americansservicemen
and
civiliansare
on
the
rolls
of
the
defense
establishment
during
the
past
two
years
by
eliminating
duplication
and
overstaffing
by
improved
procurement
and
inventory
controls
and
by
concentrating
on
the
essentials
many
billions
of
dollars
have
been
saved
in
our
defense
activities
i

should
like
to
mention
certain
fundamentals
underlying
this
vast
program
first
a
realistic
limitation
of
armaments
and
an
enduring
just
peace
remain
our
national
goals
we
maintain
powerful
military
forces
because
there
is
no
present
alternativeforces
designed
for
deterrent
and
defensive
purposes
alone
but
able
instantly
to
strike
back
with
destructive
power
in
response
to
an
attack
second
we
must
stay
alert
to
the
fact
that
undue
reliance
on
one
weapon
or
preparation
for
only
one
kind
of
warfare
simply
invites
an
enemy
to
resort
to
another
we
must
therefore
keep
in
our
armed
forces
balance
and
flexibility
adequate
for
our
purposes
and
objectives
third
to
keep
our
armed
forces
abreast
of
the
advances
of
science
our
military
planning
must
be
flexible
enough
to
utilize
the
new
weapons
and
techniques
which
flow
ever
more
speedily
from
our
research
and
development
programs
the
forthcoming
military
budget
therefore
emphasizes
modern
airpower
in
the
air
force
navy
and
marine
corps
and
increases
the
emphasis
on
new
weapons
especially
those
of
rapid
and
destructive
striking
power
it
assures
the
maintenance
of
effective
retaliatory
force
as
the
principal
deterrent
to
overt
aggression
it
accelerates
the
continental
defense
program
and
the
buildup
of
ready
military
reserve
forces
it
continues
a
vigorous
program
of
stockpiling
strategic
and
critical
materials
and
strengthening
our
mobilization
base
the
budget
also
contemplates
the
strategic
concentration
of
our
strength
through
redeployment
of
certain
forces
it
provides
for
reduction
of
forces
in
certain
categories
and
their
expansion
in
others
to
fit
them
to
the
military
realities
of
our
time
these
emphases
in
our
defense
planning
have
been
made
at
my
personal
direction
after
long
and
thoughtful
study
in
my
judgment
they
will
give
our
nation
a
defense
accurately
adjusted
to
the
national
need
fourth
pending
a
world
agreement
on
armament
limitation
we
must
continue
to
improve
and
expand
our
supplies
of
nuclear
weapons
for
our
land
naval
and
air
forces
while
at
the
same
time
continuing
our
encouraging
progress
in
the
peaceful
use
of
atomic
power
and
fifth
in
the
administration
of
these
costly
programs
we
must
demand
the
utmost
in
efficiency
and
ingenuity
we
must
assure
our
people
not
only
of
adequate
protection
but
also
of
a
defense
that
can
be
carried
forward
from
year
to
year
until
the
threat
of
aggression
has
disappeared
to
help
maintain
this
kind
of
armed
strength
and
improve
its
efficiency
i
must
urge
the
enactment
of
several
important
measures
in
this
session
the
first
concerns
the
selective
service
act
which
expires
next
june
th
for
the
foreseeable
future
our
standing
forces
must
remain
much
larger
than
voluntary
methods
can
sustain
we
must
therefore
extend
the
statutory
authority
to
induct
men
for
two
years
of
military
service
the
second
kind
of
measure
concerns
the
rapid
turnover
of
our
most
experienced
servicemen
this
process
seriously
weakens
the
combat
readiness
of
our
armed
forces
and
is
exorbitantly
expensive
to
encourage
more
trained
servicemen
to
remain
in
uniform
i
shall
on
the
thirteenth
of
this
month
propose
a
number
of
measures
to
increase
the
attractions
of
a
military
career
these
measures
will
include
more
adequate
medical
care
for
dependents
survivors
benefits
more
and
better
housing
and
selective
adjustments
in
military
pay
and
other
allowances
and
thirdalso
on
january
i
shall
present
a
program
to
rebuild
and
strengthen
the
civilian
components
of
our
armed
forces
this
is
a
comprehensive
program
designed
to
make
better
use
of
our
manpower
of
military
age
because
it
will
go
far
in
assuring
fair
and
equitable
participation
in
military
training
and
service
it
is
of
particular
importance
to
our
combat
veterans
in
keeping
with
the
historic
military
policy
of
our
republic
this
program
is
designed
to
build
and
maintain
powerful
civilian
reserves
immediately
capable
of
effective
military
service
in
an
emergency
in
lieu
of
maintaining
active
duty
forces
in
excess
of
the
nations
immediate
need
maintenance
of
an
effective
defense
requires
continuance
of
our
aggressive
attack
on
subversion
at
home
in
this
effort
we
have
in
the
past
two
years
made
excellent
progress
fbi
investigations
have
been
powerfully
reinforced
by
a
new
internal
security
division
in
the
department
of
justice
the
security
activities
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
have
been
revitalized
an
improved
and
strengthened
security
system
is
in
effect
throughout
the
government
the
department
of
justice
and
the
fbi
have
been
armed
with
effective
new
legal
weapons
forged
by
the
rd
congress
we
shall
continue
to
ferret
out
and
to
destroy
communist
subversion
we
shall
in
the
process
carefully
preserve
our
traditions
and
the
basic
rights
of
our
citizens
our
civil
defense
program
is
also
a
key
element
in
the
protection
of
our
country
we
are
developing
cooperative
methods
with
state
governors
mayors
and
voluntary
citizen
groups
as
well
as
among
federal
agencies
in
building
the
civil
defense
organization
its
significance
in
time
of
war
is
obvious
its
swift
assistance
in
disaster
areas
last
year
proved
its
importance
in
time
of
peace
an
industry
capable
of
rapid
expansion
and
essential
materials
and
facilities
swiftly
available
in
time
of
emergency
are
indispensable
to
our
defense
i
urge
therefore
a
twoyear
extension
of
the
defense
production
act
and
title
ii
of
the
first
war
powers
act
of
these
are
cornerstones
of
our
program
for
the
development
and
maintenance
of
an
adequate
mobilization
base
at
this
point
i
should
like
to
make
this
additional
observation
our
quest
for
peace
and
freedom
necessarily
presumes
that
we
who
hold
positions
of
public
trust
must
rise
above
self
and
sectionthat
we
must
subordinate
to
the
general
good
our
partisan
our
personal
pride
and
prejudice
tirelessly
with
united
purpose
we
must
fortify
the
material
and
spiritual
foundations
of
this
land
of
freedom
and
of
free
nations
throughout
the
world
as
never
before
there
is
need
for
unhesitating
cooperation
among
the
branches
of
our
government
at
this
time
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
are
under
the
management
of
different
political
parties
this
fact
places
both
parties
on
trial
before
the
american
people
in
less
perilous
days
of
the
past
division
of
governmental
responsibility
among
our
great
parties
has
produced
a
paralyzing
indecision
we
must
not
let
this
happen
in
our
time
we
must
avoid
a
paralysis
of
the
will
for
peace
and
international
security
in
the
traditionally
bipartisan
areasmilitary
security
and
foreign
relationsi
can
report
to
you
that
i
have
already
with
the
leaders
of
this
congress
expressed
assurances
of
unreserved
cooperation
yet
the
strength
of
our
country
requires
more
than
mere
maintenance
of
military
strength
and
success
in
foreign
affairs
these
vital
matters
are
in
turn
dependent
upon
concerted
and
vigorous
action
in
a
number
of
supporting
programs
i
say
therefore
to
the
th
congress
in
all
areas
basic
to
the
strength
of
america
there
will
beto
the
extent
i
can
insure
themcooperative
constructive
relations
between
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
this
government
let
the
general
good
be
our
yardstick
on
every
great
issue
of
our
time
our
efforts
to
defend
our
freedom
and
to
secure
a
just
peace
are
of
course
inseparable
from
the
second
great
purpose
of
our
government
to
help
maintain
a
strong
growing
economyan
economy
vigorous
and
free
in
which
there
are
everincreasing
opportunities
just
rewards
for
effort
and
a
stable
prosperity
that
is
widely
shared
in
the
past
two
years
many
important
governmental
actions
helped
our
economy
adjust
to
conditions
of
peace
these
and
other
actions
created
a
climate
for
renewed
economic
growth
controls
were
removed
from
wages
prices
and
materials
tax
revisions
encouraged
increased
private
spending
and
employment
federal
expenditures
were
sharply
reduced
making
possible
a
record
tax
cut
these
actions
together
with
flexible
monetary
and
debt
management
policies
helped
to
halt
inflation
and
stabilize
the
value
of
the
dollar
a
program
of
cooperation
and
partnership
in
resource
development
was
begun
social
security
and
unemployment
insurance
laws
were
broadened
and
strengthened
new
laws
started
the
long
process
of
balancing
farm
production
with
farm
markets
expanded
shipbuilding
and
stockpiling
programs
strengthened
key
sectors
of
the
economy
while
improving
our
mobilization
base
a
comprehensive
new
housing
law
brought
impressive
progress
in
an
area
fundamental
to
our
economic
strength
and
closed
loopholes
in
the
old
laws
permitting
dishonest
manipulation
many
of
these
programs
are
just
beginning
to
exert
their
main
stimulating
effect
upon
the
economy
generally
and
upon
specific
communities
and
industries
throughout
the
country
the
past
yearwas
one
of
the
most
prosperous
years
in
our
history
business
activity
now
surges
with
new
strength
production
is
rising
employment
is
high
toward
the
end
of
last
year
average
weekly
wages
in
manufacturing
were
higher
than
ever
before
personal
income
after
taxes
is
at
a
record
level
so
is
consumer
spending
construction
activity
is
reaching
new
peaks
export
demand
for
our
goods
is
strong
state
and
local
government
expenditures
on
public
works
are
rising
savings
are
high
and
credit
is
readily
available
so
today
the
transition
to
a
peacetime
economy
is
largely
behind
us
the
economic
outlook
is
good
the
many
promising
factors
i
have
mentioned
do
not
guarantee
sustained
economic
expansion
however
they
do
give
us
a
strong
position
from
which
to
carry
forward
our
economic
growth
if
we
as
a
people
act
wisely
within
ten
years
our
annual
national
output
can
rise
from
its
present
level
of
about
billion
to
billion
measured
in
dollars
of
stable
buying
power
my
budget
message
on
january
the
economic
report
on
the
th
of
this
month
and
several
special
messages
will
set
forth
in
detail
major
programs
to
foster
the
growth
of
our
economy
and
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
peoples
money
today
i
shall
discuss
these
programs
only
in
general
terms
g
overnment
efficiency
and
economy
remain
essential
to
steady
progress
toward
a
balanced
budget
more
than
ten
billion
dollars
were
cut
from
the
spending
program
proposed
in
the
budget
of
january
expenditures
of
that
year
were
six
and
a
half
billion
below
those
of
the
previous
year
in
the
current
fiscal
year
government
spending
will
be
nearly
four
and
a
half
billion
dollars
less
than
in
the
fiscal
year
which
ended
last
june
new
spending
authority
has
been
held
below
expenditures
reducing
government
obligations
accumulated
over
the
years
last
year
we
had
a
large
tax
cut
and
for
the
first
time
in
seventyfive
years
a
basic
revision
of
federal
tax
laws
it
is
now
clear
that
defense
and
other
essential
government
costs
must
remain
at
a
level
precluding
further
tax
reductions
this
year
although
excise
and
corporation
income
taxes
must
therefore
be
continued
at
their
present
rates
further
tax
cuts
will
be
possible
when
justified
by
lower
expenditures
and
by
revenue
increases
arising
from
the
nations
economic
growth
i
am
hopeful
that
such
reductions
can
be
made
next
year
at
the
foundation
of
our
economic
growth
are
the
raw
materials
and
energy
produced
from
our
minerals
and
fuels
lands
and
forests
and
water
resources
with
respect
to
them
i
believe
that
the
nation
must
adhere
to
three
fundamental
policies
first
to
develop
wisely
use
and
conserve
basic
resources
from
generation
to
generation
second
to
follow
the
historic
pattern
of
developing
these
resources
primarily
by
private
citizens
under
fair
provisions
of
law
including
restraints
for
proper
conservation
and
third
to
treat
resource
development
as
a
partnership
undertakinga
partnership
in
which
the
participation
of
private
citizens
and
state
and
local
governments
is
as
necessary
as
federal
participation
this
policy
of
partnership
and
cooperation
is
producing
good
results
most
immediately
noticeable
in
respect
to
water
resources
first
it
has
encouraged
local
public
bodies
and
private
citizens
to
plan
their
own
power
sources
increasing
numbers
of
applications
to
the
federal
power
commission
to
conduct
surveys
and
prepare
plans
for
power
development
notably
in
the
columbia
river
basin
are
evidence
of
local
response
second
the
federal
government
and
local
and
private
organizations
have
been
encouraged
to
coordinate
their
developments
this
is
important
because
federal
hydroelectric
developments
supply
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
nations
power
needs
such
partnership
projects
as
priest
rapids
in
washington
the
coosa
river
development
in
alabama
and
markham
ferry
in
oklahoma
already
have
the
approval
of
the
congress
this
year
justifiable
projects
of
a
similar
nature
will
again
have
administration
support
third
the
federal
government
must
shoulder
its
own
partnership
obligations
by
undertaking
projects
of
such
complexity
and
size
that
their
success
requires
federal
development
in
keeping
with
this
principle
i
again
urge
the
congress
to
approve
the
development
of
the
upper
colorado
river
basin
to
conserve
and
assure
better
use
of
precious
water
essential
to
the
future
of
the
west
in
addition
the
budget
will
recommend
appropriations
to
start
six
new
reclamation
and
more
than
thirty
new
corps
of
engineers
projects
of
varying
size
going
projects
and
investigations
of
potential
new
resource
developments
will
be
continued
although
this
partnership
approach
is
producing
encouraging
results
its
full
success
requires
a
nationwide
comprehensive
water
resources
policy
firmly
based
in
law
such
a
policy
is
under
preparation
and
when
completed
will
be
submitted
to
the
congress
in
the
interest
of
their
proper
conservation
development
and
use
continued
vigilance
will
be
maintained
over
our
fisheries
wildlife
resources
the
national
parks
and
forests
and
the
public
lands
and
we
shall
continue
to
encourage
an
orderly
development
of
the
nations
mineral
resources
a
modern
efficient
highway
system
is
essential
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
growing
population
our
expanding
economy
and
our
national
security
we
are
accelerating
our
highway
improvement
program
as
rapidly
as
possible
under
existing
state
and
federal
laws
and
authorizations
however
this
effort
will
not
in
itself
assure
our
people
of
an
adequate
highway
system
on
my
recommendation
this
problem
has
been
carefully
considered
by
the
conference
of
state
governors
and
by
a
special
advisory
committee
on
a
national
highway
program
composed
of
leading
private
citizens
i
have
received
the
recommendations
of
the
governors
conference
and
will
shortly
receive
the
views
of
the
special
advisory
committee
aided
by
their
findings
i
shall
submit
on
january
th
detailed
recommendations
which
will
meet
our
most
pressing
national
highway
needs
in
further
recognition
of
the
importance
of
transportation
to
our
economic
strength
and
security
the
administration
through
a
cabinet
committee
is
thoroughly
examining
existing
federal
transportation
policies
to
determine
their
effect
on
the
adequacy
of
transportation
services
this
is
the
first
such
comprehensive
review
directly
undertaken
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
in
modern
times
we
are
not
only
examining
major
problems
facing
the
various
modes
of
transport
we
are
also
studying
closely
the
interrelationships
of
civilian
and
government
requirements
for
transportation
legislation
will
be
recommended
to
correct
policy
deficiencies
which
we
may
find
the
nations
public
works
activities
are
tremendous
in
scope
it
is
expected
that
more
than
billion
will
be
expended
in
for
the
development
of
land
water
and
other
resources
control
of
floods
and
navigation
and
harbor
improvements
construction
of
roads
schools
and
municipal
water
supplies
and
disposal
of
domestic
and
industrial
wastes
many
of
the
federal
state
and
local
agencies
responsible
for
this
work
are
in
their
separate
capacities
highly
efficient
but
public
works
activities
are
closely
interrelated
and
have
a
substantial
influence
on
the
growth
of
the
country
moreover
in
times
of
threatening
economic
contraction
they
may
become
a
valuable
sustaining
force
to
these
ends
efficient
planning
and
execution
of
the
nations
public
works
require
both
the
coordination
of
federal
activities
and
effective
cooperation
with
state
and
local
governments
the
council
of
economic
advisers
through
its
public
works
planning
section
has
made
important
advances
during
the
past
year
in
effecting
this
coordination
and
cooperation
in
view
of
the
success
of
these
initial
efforts
and
to
give
more
emphasis
and
continuity
to
this
essential
coordination
i
shall
request
the
congress
to
appropriate
funds
for
the
support
of
an
office
of
coordinator
of
public
works
in
the
executive
office
of
the
president
a
most
significant
element
in
our
growing
economy
is
an
agriculture
that
is
stable
prosperous
and
free
the
problems
of
our
agriculture
have
evolved
over
many
years
and
cannot
be
solved
overnight
nevertheless
governmental
actions
last
year
hold
great
promise
of
fostering
a
better
balance
between
production
and
markets
and
consequently
a
better
and
more
stable
income
for
our
farmers
through
vigorous
administration
and
through
new
authority
provided
by
the
rd
congress
surplus
farm
products
are
now
moving
into
consumption
from
february
through
november
the
rate
of
increase
of
governmentheld
surpluses
has
been
reduced
by
our
moving
into
use
more
than
billion
dollars
worth
of
governmentowned
farm
commodities
this
amount
is
equal
to
more
than
seven
percent
of
a
years
production
of
all
our
farms
and
ranches
domestic
consumption
remains
high
and
farm
exports
will
be
higher
than
last
year
as
a
result
of
the
flexibility
provided
by
the
agricultural
act
of
we
can
move
toward
less
restrictive
acreage
controls
thus
farm
production
is
gradually
adjusting
to
markets
markets
are
being
expanded
and
stocks
are
moving
into
use
we
can
now
look
forward
to
an
easing
of
the
influences
depressing
farm
prices
to
reduced
government
expenditures
for
purchase
of
surplus
products
and
to
less
federal
intrusion
into
the
lives
and
plans
of
our
farm
people
agricultural
programs
have
been
redirected
toward
better
balance
greater
stability
and
sustained
prosperity
we
are
headed
in
the
right
direction
i
urgently
recommend
to
the
congress
that
we
continue
resolutely
on
this
road
greater
attention
must
be
directed
to
the
needs
of
lowincome
farm
families
twentyeight
per
cent
of
our
farmoperator
families
have
net
cash
incomes
of
less
than
per
year
last
year
at
my
request
careful
studies
were
made
of
the
problems
of
these
farm
people
i
shall
later
submit
recommendations
designed
to
assure
the
steady
alleviation
of
their
most
pressing
concerns
because
drought
also
remains
a
serious
agricultural
problem
i
shall
recommend
legislation
to
strengthen
federal
disaster
assistance
programs
this
legislation
will
prescribe
an
improved
appraisal
of
need
better
adjustment
of
the
various
programs
to
local
conditions
and
a
more
equitable
sharing
of
costs
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
the
prosperity
of
our
small
business
enterprises
is
an
indispensable
element
in
the
maintenance
of
our
economic
strength
creation
of
the
small
business
administration
and
recently
enacted
tax
laws
facilitating
small
business
expansion
are
but
two
of
many
important
steps
we
have
taken
to
encourage
our
smaller
enterprises
i
recommend
that
the
congress
extend
the
small
business
act
of
which
is
due
to
expire
next
june
we
come
now
to
the
third
great
purpose
of
our
governmentits
concern
for
the
health
productivity
and
wellbeing
of
all
our
people
every
citizen
wants
to
give
full
expression
to
his
godgiven
talents
and
abilities
and
to
have
the
recognition
and
respect
accorded
under
our
religious
and
political
traditions
americans
also
want
a
good
material
standard
of
livingnot
simply
to
accumulate
possessions
but
to
fulfill
a
legitimate
aspiration
for
an
environment
in
which
their
families
may
live
meaningful
and
happy
lives
our
people
are
committed
therefore
to
the
creation
and
preservation
of
opportunity
for
every
citizen
to
lead
a
more
rewarding
life
they
are

equally
committed
to
the
alleviation
of
misfortune
and
distress
among
their
fellow
citizens
the
aspirations
of
most
of
our
people
can
best
be
fulfilled
through
their
own
enterprise
and
initiative
without
government
interference
this
administration
therefore
follows
two
simple
rules
first
the
federal
government
should
perform
an
essential
task
only
when
it
cannot
otherwise
be
adequately
performed
and
second
in
performing
that
task
our
government
must
not
impair
the
selfrespect
freedom
and
incentive
of
the
individual
so
long
as
these
two
rules
are
observed
the
government
can
fully
meet
its
obligation
without
creating
a
dependent
population
or
a
domineering
bureaucracy
during
the
past
two
years
notable
advances
were
made
in
these
functions
of
government
protection
of
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
was
extended
to
an
additional
ten
million
of
our
people
and
the
benefits
were
substantially
increased
legislation
was
enacted
to
provide
unemployment
insurance
protection
to
some
four
million
additional
americans
stabilization
of
living
costs
and
the
halting
of
inflation
protected
the
value
of
pensions
and
savings
a
broad
program
now
helps
to
bring
good
homes
within
the
reach
of
the
great
majority
of
our
people
with
the
states
we
are
providing
rehabilitation
facilities
and
more
clinics
hospitals
and
nursing
homes
for
patients
with
chronic
illnesses
also
with
the
states
we
have
begun
a
great
and
fruitful
expansion
in
the
restoration
of
disabled
persons
to
employment
and
useful
lives
in
the
areas
of
federal
responsibility
we
have
made
historic
progress
in
eliminating
from
among
our
people
demeaning
practices
based
on
race
or
color
all
of
us
may
be
proud
of
these
achievements
during
the
past
two
years
yet
essential
federal
tasks
remain
to
be
done
as
part
of
our
efforts
to
provide
decent
safe
and
sanitary
housing
for
lowincome
families
we
must
carry
forward
the
housing
program
authorized
during
the
rd
congress
we
must
also
authorize
contracts
for
a
firm
program
of
additional
public
housing
units
in
each
of
the
next
two
fiscal
years
this
program
will
meet
the
most
pressing
obligations
of
the
federal
government
into
the
fiscal
year
for
planning
and
building
public
housing
by
that
time
the
private
building
industry
aided
by
the
housing
act
of
will
have
had
the
opportunity
to
assume
its
full
role
in
providing
adequate
housing
for
our
low
income
families
the
health
of
our
people
is
one
of
our
most
precious
assets
preventable
sickness
should
be
prevented
knowledge
available
to
combat
disease
and
disability
should
be
fully
used
otherwise
we
as
a
people
are
guilty
not
only
of
neglect
of
human
suffering
but
also
of
wasting
our
national
strength
constant
advances
in
medical
care
are
not
available
to
enough
of
our
citizens
clearly
our
nation
must
do
more
to
reduce
the
impact
of
accident
and
disease
two
fundamental
problems
confront
us
first
high
and
everrising
costs
of
health
services
second
serious
gaps
and
shortages
in
these
services
by
special
message
on
january
i
shall
propose
a
coordinated
program
to
strengthen
and
improve
existing
health
services
this
program
will
continue
to
reject
socialized
medicine
it
will
emphasize
individual
and
local
responsibility
under
it
the
federal
government
will
neither
dominate
nor
direct
but
serve
as
a
helpful
partner
within
this
framework
the
program
can
be
broad
in
scope
my
recommendations
will
include
a
federal
health
reinsurance
service
to
encourage
the
development
of
more
and
better
voluntary
health
insurance
coverage
by
private
organizations
i
shall
also
recommend
measures
to
improve
the
medical
care
of
that
group
of
our
citizens
who
because
of
need
receive
federalstate
public
assistance
these
two
proposals
will
help
more
of
our
people
to
meet
the
costs
of
health
services
to
reduce
the
gaps
in
these
services
i
shall
propose
new
measures
to
facilitate
construction
of
needed
health
facilities
and
help
reduce
shortages
of
trained
health
personnel
vigorous
steps
to
combat
the
misery
and
national
loss
involved
in
mental
illness
improved
services
for
crippled
children
and
for
maternal
and
child
health
better
consumer
protection
under
our
existing
pure
food
and
drug
laws
and
finally
strengthened
programs
to
combat
the
increasingly
serious
pollution
of
our
rivers
and
streams
and
the
growing
problem
of
air
pollution
these
measures
together
constitute
a
comprehensive
program
holding
rich
promise
for
better
health
for
all
of
our
people
last
years
expansion
of
social
security
coverage
and
our
new
program
of
improved
medical
care
for
public
assistance
recipients
together
suggest
modification
of
the
formula
for
federal
sharing
in
old
age
assistance
payments
i
recommend
modification
of
the
formula
where
such
payments
will
in
the
future
supplement
benefits
received
under
the
old
age
and
survivors
insurance
system
it
is
the
inalienable
right
of
every
person
from
childhood
on
to
have
access
to
knowledge
in
our
form
of
society
this
right
of
the
individual
takes
on
a
special
meaning
for
the
education
of
all
our
citizens
is
imperative
to
the
maintenance
and
invigoration
of
americas
free
institutions
today
we
face
grave
educational
problems
effective
and
uptodate
analyses
of
these
problems
and
their
solutions
are
being
carried
forward
through
the
individual
state
conferences
and
the
white
house
conference
to
be
completed
this
year
however
such
factors
as
population
growth
additional
responsibilities
of
schools
and
increased
and
longer
school
attendance
have
produced
an
unprecedented
classroom
shortage
this
shortage
is
of
immediate
concern
to
all
of
our
people
positive
affirmative
action
must
be
taken
now
without
impairing
in
any
way
the
responsibilities
of
our
states
localities
communities
or
families
the
federal
government
can
and
should
serve
as
an
effectivecatalyst
in
dealing
with
this
problem
i
shall
forward
a
special
message
to
the
congress
on
february
presenting
an
affirmative
program
dealing
with
this
shortage
to
help
the
states
do
a
better
and
more
timely
job
we
must
strengthen
their
resources
for
preventing
and
dealing
with
juvenile
delinquency
i
shall
propose
federal
legislation
to
assist
the
states
to
promote
concerted
action
in
dealing
with
this
nationwide
problem
i
shall
carry
forward
the
vigorous
efforts
of
the
administration
to
improve
the
international
control
of
the
traffic
in
narcotics
and
in
cooperation
with
state
and
local
agencies
to
combat
narcotic
addiction
in
our
country
i
should
like
to
speak
now
of
additional
matters
of
importance
to
all
our
people
and
especially
to
our
wage
earners
during
the
past
year
certain
industrial
changes
and
the
readjustment
of
the
economy
to
conditions
of
peace
brought
unemployment
and
other
difficulties
to
various
localities
and
industries
these
problems
are
engaging
our
most
earnest
attention
but
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
our
working
people
the
past
year
has
meant
good
jobs
moreover
the
earnings
and
savings
of
our
wage
earners
are
no
longer
depreciating
in
value
because
of
cooperative
relations
between
labor
and
management
fewer
working
days
were
lost
through
strikes
in
than
in
any
year
in
the
past
decade
the
outlook
for
our
wage
earners
can
be
made
still
more
promising
by
several
legislative
actions
first
in
the
past
five
years
we
have
had
economic
growth
which
will
support
an
increase
in
the
federal
minimum
wage
in
the
light
of
present
economic
conditions
i
recommend
its
increase
to
ninety
cents
an
hour
i
also
recommend
that
many
others
at
present
excluded
be
given
the
protection
of
a
minimum
wage
second
i
renew
my
recommendation
of
last
year
for
amendment
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
to
further
the
basic
objectives
of
this
statute
i
especially
call
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
amendments
dealing
with
the
right
of
economic
strikers
to
vote
in
representation
elections
and
the
need
for
equalizing
the
obligation
under
the
act
to
file
disclaimers
of
communist
affiliation
third
the
administration
will
propose
other
important
measures
including
occupational
safety
workmens
compensation
for
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
and
the
eight
hour
laws
applicable
to
federal
contractors
legislation
will
also
be
proposed
respecting
nonoccupational
disability
insurance
and
unemployment
compensation
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
considering
human
needs
the
federal
government
must
take
special
responsibility
for
citizens
in
its
direct
employ
on
january
i
shall
propose
a
pay
adjustment
plan
for
civilian
employees
outside
the
postal
field
service
to
correct
inequities
and
increase
individual
pay
rates
i
shall
also
recommend
voluntary
health
insurance
on
a
contributory
basis
for
federal
employees
and
their
dependents
in
keeping
with
the
group
life
insurance
act
passed
in
the
rd
congress
this
protection
should
be
provided
on
the
group
insurance
principle
and
purchased
from
private
facilities
also
on
january
i
shall
recommend
a
modern
pay
plan
including
pay
increases
for
postal
field
employees
as
part
of
this
program
and
to
carry
forward
our
progress
toward
elimination
of
the
large
annual
postal
deficit
i
shall
renew
my
request
for
an
increase
in
postal
rates
again
i
urge
that
in
the
future
the
fixing
of
rates
be
delegated
to
an
impartial
independent
body
more
adequate
training
programs
to
equip
career
employees
of
the
government
to
render
improved
public
service
will
be
recommended
as
will
improvements
in
the
laws
affecting
employees
serving
on
foreign
assignments
needed
improvements
in
survivor
disability
and
retirement
benefits
for
federal
civilian
and
military
personnel
have
been
extensively
considered
by
the
committee
on
retirement
policy
for
federal
personnel
the
committees
proposals
would
strengthen
and
improve
benefits
for
our
career
people
in
government
and
i
endorse
their
broad
objectives
full
contributory
coverage
under
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
should
be
made
available
to
all
federal
personnel
just
as
in
private
industry
for
career
military
personnel
the
protection
of
the
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
system
would
be
an
important
and
lon
gneeded
addition
especially
to
their
present
unequal
and
inadequate
survivorship
protection
the
military
retirement
pay
system
should
remain
separate
and
unchanged
certain
adjustments
in
the
present
civilian
personnel
retirement
systems
will
be
needed
to
reflect
the
additional
protection
of
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
however
these
systems
also
are
a
basic
part
of
a
total
compensation
and
should
be
separately
and
independently
retained
i
also
urge
the
congress
to
approve
a
long
overdue
increase
in
the
salaries
of
members
of
the
congress
and
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
a
level
commensurate
with
their
heavy
responsibilities
our
concern
for
the
individual
in
our
country
requires
that
we
consider
several
additional
problems
we
must
continue
our
program
to
help
our
indian
citizens
improve
their
lot
and
make
their
full
contribution
to
national
life
two
years
ago
i
advised
the
congress
of
injustices
under
existing
immigration
laws
through
humane
administration
the
department
of
justice
is
doing
what
it
legally
can
to
alleviate
hardships
clearance
of
aliens
before
arrival
has
been
initiated
and
except
for
criminal
offenders
the
imprisonment
of
aliens
awaiting
admission
or
deportation
has
been
stopped
certain
provisions
of
law
however
have
the
effect
of
compelling
action
in
respect
to
aliens
which
are
inequitable
in
some
instances
and
discriminatory
in
others
these
provisions
should
be
corrected
in
this
session
of
the
congress
as
the
complex
problems
of
alaska
are
resolved
that
territory
should
expect
to
achieve
statehood
in
the
meantime
there
is
no
justification
for
deferring
the
admission
to
statehood
of
hawaii
i
again
urge
approval
of
this
measure
we
have
three
splendid
opportunities
to
demonstrate
the
strength
of
our
belief
in
the
right
of
suffrage
first
i
again
urge
that
a
constitutional
amendment
be
submitted
to
the
states
to
reduce
the
voting
age
for
federal
elections
second
i
renew
my
request
that
the
principle
of
selfgovernment
be
extended
and
the
right
of
suffrage
granted
to
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
third
i
again
recommend
that
we
work
with
the
states
to
preserve
the
voting
fights
of
citizens
in
the
nations
service
overseas
in
our
determination
to
keep
faith
with
those
who
in
the
past
have
met
the
highest
call
of
citizenship
we
now
have
under
study
the
system
of
benefits
for
veterans
and
for
surviving
dependents
of
deceased
veterans
and
servicemen
studies
will
be
undertaken
to
determine
the
need
for
measures
to
ease
the
readjustment
to
civilian
life
of
men
required
to
enter
the
armed
forces
for
two
years
of
service
in
the
advancement
of
the
various
activities
which
will
make
our
civilization
endure
and
flourish
the
federal
government
should
do
more
to
give
official
recognition
to
the
importance
of
the
arts
and
other
cultural
activities
i
shall
recommend
the
establishment
of
a
federal
advisory
commission
on
the
arts
within
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
to
advise
the
federal
government
on
ways
to
encourage
artistic
endeavor
and
appreciation
i
shall
also
propose
that
awards
of
merit
be
established
whereby
we
can
honor
our
fellow
citizens
who
make
great
contribution
to
the
advancement
of
our
civilization
every
citizen
rightly
expects
efficient
and
economical
administration
of
these
many
government
programs
i
have
outlined
today
i
strongly
recommend
extension
of
the
reorganization
act
and
the
law
establishing
the
commission
on
intergovernmental
relations
both
of
which
expire
this
spring
thus
the
congress
will
assure
continuation
of
the
excellent
progress
recently
made
in
improving
government
organization
and
administration
in
this
connection
we
are
looking
forward
with
great
interest
to
the
reports
which
will
soon
be
going
to
the
congress
from
the
commission
on
organization
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
i
am
sure
that
these
studies
made
under
the
chairmanship
of
former
president
herbert
hoover
with
the
assistance
of
more
than
two
hundred
distinguished
citizens
will
be
of
great
value
in
paving
the
way
toward
more
efficiency
and
economy
in
the
government
and
now
i
return
to
the
point
at
which
i
beganthe
faith
of
our
people
the
many
programs
here
summarized
are
i
believe
in
full
keeping
with
their
needs
interests
and
aspirations
the
obligations
upon
us
are
clear
to
labor
earnestly
patiently
prayerfully
for
peace
for
freedom
for
justice
throughout
the
world
to
keep
our
economy
vigorous
and
free
that
our
people
may
lead
fuller
happier
lives
to
advance
not
merely
by
our
words
but
by
our
acts
the
determination
of
our
government
that
every
citizen
shall
have
opportunity
to
develop
to
his
fullest
capacity
as
we
do
these
things
before
us
is
a
future
filled
with
opportunity
and
hope
that
future
will
be
ours
if
in
our
time
we
keep
alive
the
patience
the
courage
the
confidence
in
tomorrow
the
deep
faith
of
the
millions
who
in
years
past
made
and
preserved
us
this
nation
a
decade
ago
in
the
death
and
desolation
of
european
battlefields
i
saw
the
courage
and
resolution
i
felt
the
inspiration
of
american
youth
in
these
young
men
i
felt
americas
buoyant
confidence
and
irresistible
willtodo
in
them
i
saw
too
a
devout
america
humble
before
god
and
so
i
know
with
all
my
heartand
i
deeply
believe
that
all
americans
knowthat
despite
the
anxieties
of
this
divided
world
our
faith
and
the
cause
in
which
we
all
believe
will
surely
prevail

mr
president
mr
speaker
members
of
the
eightythird
congress
it
is
a
high
honor
again
to
present
to
the
congress
my
views
on
the
state
of
the
union
and
to
recommend
measures
to
advance
the
security
prosperity
and
wellbeing
of
the
american
people
all
branches
of
this
governmentand
i
venture
to
say
both
of
our
great
partiescan
support
the
general
objective
of
the
recommendations
i
make
today
for
that
objective
is
the
building
of
a
stronger
america
a
nation
whose
every
citizen
has
good
reason
for
bold
hope
where
effort
is
rewarded
and
prosperity
is
shared
where
freedom
expands
and
peace
is
securethat
is
what
i
mean
by
a
stronger
america
toward
this
objective
a
real
momentum
has
been
developed
during
this
administrations
first
year
in
office
we
mean
to
continue
that
momentum
and
to
increase
it
we
mean
to
build
a
better
future
for
this
nation
much
for
which
we
may
be
thankful
has
happened
during
the
past
year
first
of
all
we
are
deeply
grateful
that
our
sons
no
longer
die
on
the
distant
mountains
of
korea
although
they
are
still
called
from
our
homes
to
military
service
they
are
no
longer
called
to
the
field
of
battle
the
nation
has
just
completed
the
most
prosperous
year
in
its
history
the
damaging
effect
of
inflation
on
the
wages
pensions
salaries
and
savings
of
us
all
has
been
brought
under
control
taxes
have
begun
to
go
down
the
cost
of
our
government
has
been
reduced
and
its
work
proceeds
with
some
fewer
employees
thus
the
discouraging
trend
of
modern
governments
toward
their
own
limitless
expansion
has
in
our
case
been
reversed
the
cost
of
armaments
becomes
less
oppressive
as
we
near
our
defense
goals
yet
we
are
militarily
stronger
every
day
during
the
year
creation
of
the
new
cabinet
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
symbolized
the
governments
permanent
concern
with
the
human
problems
of
our
citizens
segregation
in
the
armed
forces
and
other
federal
activities
is
on
the
way
out
we
have
also
made
progress
toward
its
elimination
in
the
district
of
columbia
these
are
steps
in
the
continuing
effort
to
eliminate
interracial
difficulty
some
developments
beyond
our
shores
have
been
equally
encouraging
communist
aggression
halted
in
korea
continues
to
meet
in
indochina
the
vigorous
resistance
of
france
and
the
associated
states
assisted
by
timely
aid
from
our
country
in
west
germany
in
iran
and
in
other
areas
of
the
world
heartening
political
victories
have
been
won
by
the
forces
of
stability
and
freedom
slowly
but
surely
the
free
world
gathers
strength
meanwhile
from
behind
the
iron
curtain
there
are
signs
that
tyranny
is
in
trouble
and
reminders
that
its
structure
is
as
brittle
as
its
surface
is
hard
there
has
been
in
fact
a
great
strategic
change
in
the
world
during
the
past
year
that
precious
intangible
the
initiative
is
becoming
ours
our
policy
not
limited
to
mere
reaction
against
crises
provoked
by
others
is
free
to
develop
along
lines
of
our
choice
not
only
abroad
but
also
at
home
as
a
major
theme
for
american
policy
during
the
coming
year
let
our
joint
determination
be
to
hold
this
new
initiative
and
to
use
it
we
shall
use
this
initiative
to
promote
three
broad
purposes
first
to
protect
the
freedom
of
our
people
second
to
maintain
a
strong
growing
economy
third
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
human
problems
of
the
individual
citizen
only
by
active
concern
for
each
of
these
purposes
can
we
be
sure
that
we
are
on
the
forward
road
to
a
better
and
a
stronger
america
all
my
recommendations
today
are
in
furtherance
of
these
three
purposes
i
foreign
affairs
american
freedom
is
threatened
so
long
as
the
world
communist
conspiracy
exists
in
its
present
scope
power
and
hostility
more
closely
than
ever
before
american
freedom
is
interlocked
with
the
freedom
of
other
people
in
the
unity
of
the
free
world
lies
our
best
chance
to
reduce
the
communist
threat
without
war
in
the
task
of
maintaining
this
unity
and
strengthening
all
its
parts
the
greatest
responsibility
falls
naturally
on
those
who
like
ourselves
retain
the
most
freedom
and
strength
we
shall
therefore
continue
to
advance
the
cause
of
freedom
on
foreign
fronts
in
the
far
east
we
retain
our
vital
interest
in
korea
we
have
negotiated
with
the
republic
of
korea
a
mutual
security
pact
which
develops
our
security
system
for
the
pacific
and
which
i
shall
promptly
submit
to
the
senate
for
its
consent
to
ratification
we
are
prepared
to
meet
any
renewal
of
armed
aggression
in
korea
we
shall
maintain
indefinitely
our
bases
in
okinawa
i
shall
ask
the
congress
to
authorize
continued
material
assistance
to
hasten
the
successful
conclusion
of
the
struggle
in
indochina
this
assistance
will
also
bring
closer
the
day
when
the
associated
states
may
enjoy
the
independence
already
assured
by
france
we
shall
also
continue
military
and
economic
aid
to
the
nationalist
government
of
china
in
south
asia
profound
changes
are
taking
place
in
free
nations
which
are
demonstrating
their
ability
to
progress
through
democratic
methods
they
provide
an
inspiring
contrast
to
the
dictatorial
methods
and
backward
course
of
events
in
communist
china
in
these
continuing
efforts
the
free
peoples
of
south
asia
can
be
assured
of
the
support
of
the
united
states
in
the
middle
east
where
tensions
and
serious
problems
exist
we
will
show
sympathetic
and
impartial
friendship
in
western
europe
our
policy
rests
firmly
on
the
north
atlantic
treaty
it
will
remain
so
based
as
far
ahead
as
we
can
see
within
its
organization
the
building
of
a
united
european
community
including
france
and
germany
is
vital
to
a
free
and
selfreliant
europe
this
will
be
promoted
by
the
european
defense
community
which
offers
assurance
of
european
security
with
the
coming
of
unity
to
western
europe
the
assistance
this
nation
can
render
for
the
security
of
europe
and
the
free
world
will
be
multiplied
in
effectiveness
in
the
western
hemisphere
we
shall
continue
to
develop
harmonious
and
mutually
beneficial
cooperation
with
our
neighbors
indeed
solid
friendship
with
all
our
american
neighbors
is
a
cornerstone
of
our
entire
policy
in
the
world
as
a
whole
the
united
nations
admittedly
still
in
a
state
of
evolution
means
much
to
the
united
states
it
has
given
uniquely
valuable
services
in
many
places
where
violence
threatened
it
is
the
only
real
world
forum
where
we
have
the
opportunity
for
international
presentation
and
rebuttal
it
is
a
place
where
the
nations
of
the
world
can
if
they
have
the
will
take
collective
action
for
peace
and
justice
it
is
a
place
where
the
guilt
can
be
squarely
assigned
to
those
who
fail
to
take
all
necessary
steps
to
keep
the
peace
the
united
nations
deserves
our
continued
firm
support
foreign
assistance
and
trade
in
the
practical
application
of
our
foreign
policy
we
enter
the
field
of
foreign
assistance
and
trade
military
assistance
must
be
continued
technical
assistance
must
be
maintained
economic
assistance
can
be
reduced
however
our
economic
programs
in
korea
and
in
a
few
other
critical
places
of
the
world
are
especially
important
and
i
shall
ask
congress
to
continue
them
in
the
next
fiscal
year
the
forthcoming
budget
message
will
propose
maintenance
of
the
presidential
power
of
transferability
of
all
assistance
funds
and
will
ask
authority
to
merge
these
funds
with
the
regular
defense
funds
it
will
also
propose
that
the
secretary
of
defense
have
primary
responsibility
for
the
administration
of
foreign
military
assistance
in
accordance
with
the
policy
guidance
of
the
secretary
of
state
the
fact
that
we
can
now
reduce
our
foreign
economic
assistance
in
many
areas
is
gratifying
evidence
that
its
objectives
are
being
achieved
by
continuing
to
surpass
her
prewar
levels
of
economic
activity
western
europe
gains
selfreliance
thus
our
relationship
enters
a
new
phase
which
can
bring
results
beneficial
to
our
taxpayers
and
our
allies
alike
if
still
another
step
is
taken
this
step
is
the
creation
of
a
healthier
and
freer
system
of
trade
and
payments
within
the
free
worlda
system
in
which
our
allies
can
earn
their
own
way
and
our
own
economy
can
continue
to
flourish
the
free
world
can
no
longer
afford
the
kinds
of
arbitrary
restraints
on
trade
that
have
continued
ever
since
the
war
on
this
problem
i
shall
submit
to
the
congress
detailed
recommendations
after
our
joint
commission
on
foreign
economic
policy
has
made
its
report
atomic
energy
proposal
as
we
maintain
our
military
strength
during
the
coming
year
and
draw
closer
the
bonds
with
our
allies
we
shall
be
in
an
improved
position
to
discuss
outstanding
issues
with
the
soviet
union
indeed
we
shall
be
glad
to
do
so
whenever
there
is
a
reasonable
prospect
of
constructive
results
in
this
spirit
the
atomic
energy
proposals
of
the
united
states
were
recently
presented
to
the
united
nations
general
assembly
a
truly
constructive
soviet
reaction
will
make
possible
a
new
start
toward
an
era
of
peace
and
away
from
the
fatal
road
toward
atomic
war
defense
since
our
hope
is
peace
we
owe
ourselves
and
the
world
a
candid
explanation
of
the
military
measures
we
are
taking
to
make
that
peace
secure
as
we
enter
this
new
year
our
military
power
continues
to
grow
this
power
is
for
our
own
defense
and
to
deter
aggression
we
shall
not
be
aggressors
but
we
and
our
allies
have
and
will
maintain
a
massive
capability
to
strike
back
here
are
some
of
the
considerations
in
our
defense
planning
first
while
determined
to
use
atomic
power
to
serve
the
usages
of
peace
we
take
into
full
account
our
great
and
growing
number
of
nuclear
weapons
and
the
most
effective
means
of
using
them
against
an
aggressor
if
they
are
needed
to
preserve
our
freedom
our
defense
will
be
stronger
if
under
appropriate
security
safeguards
we
share
with
our
allies
certain
knowledge
of
the
tactical
use
of
our
nuclear
weapons
i
urge
the
congress
to
provide
the
needed
authority
second
the
usefulness
of
these
new
weapons
creates
new
relationships
between
men
and
materials
these
new
relationships
permit
economies
in
the
use
of
men
as
we
build
forces
suited
to
our
situation
in
the
world
today
as
will
be
seen
from
the
budg
et
message
on
january
the
airpower
of
our
navy
and
air
force
is
receiving
heavy
emphasis
third
our
armed
forces
must
regain
maximum
mobility
of
action
our
strategic
reserves
must
be
centrally
placed
and
readily
deployable
to
meet
sudden
aggression
against
ourselves
and
our
allies
fourth
our
defense
must
rest
on
trained
manpower
and
its
most
economical
and
mobile
use
a
professional
corps
is
the
heart
of
any
security
organization
it
is
necessarily
the
teacher
and
leader
of
those
who
serve
temporarily
in
the
discharge
of
the
obligation
to
help
defend
the
republic
pay
alone
will
not
retain
in
the
career
service
of
our
armed
forces
the
necessary
numbers
of
longterm
personnel
i
strongly
urge
therefore
a
more
generous
use
of
other
benefits
important
to
service
morale
among
these
are
more
adequate
living
quarters
and
family
housing
units
and
medical
care
for
dependents
studies
of
military
manpower
have
just
been
completed
by
the
national
security
training
commission
and
a
committee
appointed
by
the
director
of
the
office
of
defense
mobilization
evident
weaknesses
exist
in
the
state
of
readiness
and
organization
of
our
reserve
forces
measures
to
correct
these
weaknesses
will
be
later
submitted
to
the
congress
fifth
the
ability
to
convert
swiftly
from
partial
to
allout
mobilization
is
imperative
to
our
security
for
the
first
time
mobilization
officials
know
what
the
requirements
are
for
major
items
needed
for
military
uses
these
data
now
being
related
to
civilian
requirements
and
our
supply
potential
will
show
us
the
gaps
in
our
mobilization
base
thus
we
shall
have
more
realistic
plantexpansion
and
stockpiling
goals
we
shall
speed
their
attainment
this
nation
is
at
last
to
have
an
uptodate
mobilization
basethe
foundation
of
a
sound
defense
program
another
part
of
this
foundation
is
of
course
our
continental
transport
system
some
of
our
vital
heavy
materials
come
increasingly
from
canada
indeed
our
relations
with
canada
happily
always
close
involve
more
and
more
the
unbreakable
ties
of
strategic
interdependence
both
nations
now
need
the
st
lawrence
seaway
for
security
as
well
as
for
economic
reasons
i
urge
the
congress
promptly
to
approve
our
participation
in
its
construction
sixth
military
and
nonmilitary
measures
for
continental
defense
must
be
and
are
being
strengthened
in
the
current
fiscal
year
we
are
allocating
to
these
purposes
an
increasing
portion
of
our
effort
and
in
the
next
fiscal
year
we
shall
spend
nearly
a
billion
dollars
more
for
them
than
in
an
indispensable
part
of
our
continental
security
is
our
civil
defense
effort
this
will
succeed
only
as
we
have
the
complete
cooperation
of
state
governors
mayors
and
voluntary
citizen
groups
with
their
help
we
can
advance
a
cooperative
program
which
if
an
attack
should
come
would
save
many
lives
and
lessen
destruction
the
defense
program
recommended
in
the
budget
is
consistent
with
all
of
the
considerations
which
i
have
just
discussed
it
is
based
on
a
new
military
program
unanimously
recommended
by
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
and
approved
by
me
following
consideration
by
the
national
security
council
this
new
program
will
make
and
keep
america
strong
in
an
age
of
peril
nothing
should
bar
its
attainment
the
international
and
defense
policies
which
i
have
outlined
will
enable
us
to
negotiate
from
a
position
of
strength
as
we
hold
our
resolute
course
toward
a
peaceful
world
we
now
turn
to
matters
which
are
normally
characterized
as
domestic
well
realizing
that
what
we
do
abroad
affects
every
problem
at
homefrom
the
amount
of
taxes
to
our
very
state
of
mind
internal
security
under
the
standards
established
for
the
new
employee
security
program
more
than
employees
have
been
separated
from
the
federal
government
our
national
security
demands
that
the
investigation
of
new
employees
and
the
evaluation
of
derogatory
information
respecting
present
employees
be
expedited
and
concluded
at
the
earliest
possible
date
i
shall
recommend
that
the
congress
provide
additional
funds
where
necessary
to
speed
these
important
procedures
from
the
special
employment
standards
of
the
federal
government
i
turn
now
to
a
matter
relating
to
american
citizenship
the
subversive
character
of
the
communist
party
in
the
united
states
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
in
many
ways
including
court
proceedings
we
should
recognize
by
law
a
fact
that
is
plain
to
all
thoughtful
citizensthat
we
are
dealing
here
with
actions
akin
to
treasonthat
when
a
citizen
knowingly
participates
in
the
communist
conspiracy
he
no
longer
holds
allegiance
to
the
united
states
i
recommend
that
congress
enact
legislation
to
provide
that
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
is
convicted
in
the
courts
of
hereafter
conspiring
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
this
government
by
force
or
violence
be
treated
as
having
by
such
act
renounced
his
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
forfeited
his
united
states
citizenship
in
addition
the
attorney
general
will
soon
appear
before
your
committees
to
present
his
recommendations
for
needed
additional
legal
weapons
with
which
to
combat
subversion
in
our
country
and
to
deal
with
the
question
of
claimed
immunity
ii
strong
economy
i
turn
now
to
the
second
great
purpose
of
our
government
along
with
the
protection
of
freedom
the
maintenance
of
a
strong
and
growing
economy
the
american
economy
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
it
undergirds
our
international
position
our
military
security
and
the
standard
of
living
of
every
citizen
this
administration
is
determined
to
keep
our
economy
strong
and
to
keep
it
growing
at
this
moment
we
are
in
transition
from
a
wartime
to
a
peacetime
economy
i
am
confident
that
we
can
complete
this
transition
without
serious
interruption
in
our
economic
growth
but
we
shall
not
leave
this
vital
matter
to
chance
economic
preparedness
is
fully
as
important
to
the
nation
as
military
preparedness
subsequent
special
messages
and
the
economic
report
on
january
will
set
forth
plans
of
the
administration
and
its
recommendations
for
congressional
action
these
will
include
flexible
credit
and
debt
management
policies
tax
measures
to
stimulate
consumer
and
business
spending
suitable
lending
guaranteeing
insuring
and
grantinaid
activities
strengthened
oldage
and
unemployment
insurance
measures
improved
agricultural
programs
publicworks
plans
laid
well
in
advance
enlarged
opportunities
for
international
trade
and
investment
this
mere
enumeration
of
these
subjects
implies
the
vast
amount
of
study
coordination
and
planning
to
say
nothing
of
authorizing
legislation
that
altogether
make
our
economic
preparedness
complete
if
new
conditions
arise
that
require
additional
administrative
or
legislative
action
the
administration
will
still
be
ready
a
government
always
ready
as
this
is
to
take
welltimed
and
vigorous
action
and
a
business
community
willing
as
ours
is
to
plan
boldly
and
with
confidence
can
between
them
develop
a
climate
assuring
steady
economic
growth
the
budget
i
shall
submit
to
the
congress
on
january
the
first
budget
prepared
by
this
administration
for
the
period
july
through
june
this
budget
is
adequate
to
the
current
needs
of
the
government
it
recognizes
that
a
federal
budget
should
be
a
stabilizing
factor
in
the
economy
its
tax
and
expenditure
programs
will
foster
individual
initiative
and
economic
growth
pending
the
transmittal
of
my
budget
message
i
shall
mention
here
only
a
few
points
about
our
budgetary
situation
first
one
of
our
initial
acts
was
to
revise
with
the
cooperation
of
the
congress
the
budget
prepared
before
this
administration
took
office
requests
for
new
appropriations
were
greatly
reduced
in
addition
the
spending
level
provided
in
that
budget
for
the
current
fiscal
year
has
been
reduced
by
about
in
the
next
fiscal
year
we
estimate
a
further
reduction
in
expenditures
of
more
than
this
will
reduce
the
spending
level
over
the
two
fiscal
years
by
more
than
we
are
also
reducing
further
our
requests
for
new
appropriations
second
despite
the
substantial
loss
of
revenue
in
the
coming
fiscal
year
resulting
from
tax
reductions
now
in
effect
and
tax
adjustments
which
i
shall
propose
our
reduced
spending
will
move
the
new
budget
closer
to
a
balance
third
by
keeping
new
appropriation
requests
below
estimated
revenues
we
continue
to
reduce
the
tremendous
accumulation
of
unfinanced
obligations
incurred
by
the
government
under
past
appropriations
fourth
until
those
claims
on
our
governments
revenues
are
further
reduced
the
growth
in
the
public
debt
cannot
be
entirely
stopped
because
of
thisbecause
the
governments
bills
have
to
be
paid
every
month
while
the
tax
money
to
pay
them
comes
in
with
great
unevenness
within
the
fiscal
yearand
because
of
the
need
for
flexibility
to
manage
this
enormous
debt
i
find
it
necessary
to
renew
my
request
for
an
increase
in
the
statutory
debt
limit
taxes
the
new
budget
provides
for
a
lower
level
of
taxation
than
has
prevailed
in
preceding
years
six
days
ago
individual
income
taxes
were
reduced
and
the
excess
profits
tax
expired
these
tax
reductions
are
justified
only
because
of
the
substantial
reductions
we
already
have
made
and
are
making
in
governmental
expenditures
as
additional
reductions
in
expenditures
are
brought
gradually
but
surely
into
sight
further
reductions
in
taxes
can
and
will
be
made
when
budget
savings
and
sound
governmental
financing
are
assured
tax
burdens
should
be
reduced
so
that
taxpayers
may
spend
their
own
money
in
their
own
way
while
we
are
moving
toward
lower
levels
of
taxation
we
must
thoroughly
revise
our
whole
tax
system
the
groundwork
for
this
revision
has
already
been
laid
by
the
committee
on
ways
and
means
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
close
consultation
with
the
department
of
the
treasury
we
should
now
remove
the
more
glaring
tax
inequities
particularly
on
small
taxpayers
reduce
restraints
on
the
growth
of
small
business
and
make
other
changes
that
will
encourage
initiative
enterprise
and
production
twentyfive
recommendations
toward
these
ends
will
be
contained
in
my
budget
message
without
attempting
to
summariz
e
these
manifold
reforms
i
can
here
illustrate
their
tendency
for
example
we
propose
more
liberal
tax
treatment
for
dependent
children
who
work
for
widows
or
widowers
with
dependent
children
and
for
medical
expenses
for
the
business
that
wants
to
expand
or
modernize
its
plant
we
propose
liberalized
tax
treatment
of
depreciation
research
and
development
expenses
and
retained
earnings
because
of
the
present
need
for
revenue
the
corporation
income
tax
should
be
kept
at
the
current
rate
of
for
another
year
and
the
excise
taxes
scheduled
to
be
reduced
on
april
first
including
those
on
liquor
tobacco
gasoline
and
automobiles
should
be
continued
at
present
rates
immediate
extension
of
the
renegotiation
act
of
is
also
needed
to
eliminate
excessive
profits
and
to
prevent
waste
of
public
funds
in
the
purchase
of
defense
materials
agriculture
the
well
being
of
our
million
people
demands
a
stable
and
prosperous
agriculture
conversely
every
farmer
knows
he
cannot
prosper
unless
all
america
prospers
as
we
seek
to
promote
increases
in
our
standard
of
living
we
must
be
sure
that
the
farmer
fairly
shares
in
that
increase
therefore
a
farm
program
promoting
stability
and
prosperity
in
all
elements
of
our
agriculture
is
urgently
needed
agricultural
laws
now
in
effect
successfully
accomplished
their
wartime
purpose
of
encouraging
maximum
production
of
many
crops
today
production
of
these
crops
at
such
levels
far
exceeds
present
demand
yet
the
laws
encouraging
such
production
are
still
in
effect
the
storage
facilities
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation
bulge
with
surplus
stocks
of
dairy
products
wheat
cotton
corn
and
certain
vegetable
oils
and
the
corporations
presently
authorized
borrowing
authorityis
nearly
exhausted
some
products
priced
out
of
domestic
markets
and
others
priced
out
of
world
markets
have
piled
up
in
government
hands
in
a
world
in
which
millions
of
people
are
hungry
destruction
of
food
would
of
course
be
unconscionable
yet
surplus
stocks
continue
to
threaten
the
market
and
in
spite
of
the
acreage
controls
authorized
by
present
law
surpluses
will
continue
to
accumulate
we
confront
two
alternatives
the
first
is
to
impose
still
greater
acreage
reductions
for
some
crops
and
apply
rigid
federal
controls
over
the
use
of
the
diverted
acres
this
will
regiment
the
production
of
every
basic
agricultural
crop
it
will
place
every
producer
of
those
crops
under
the
domination
and
control
of
the
federal
government
in
washington
this
alternative
is
contrary
to
the
fundamental
interests
not
only
of
the
farmer
but
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
nor
is
it
a
real
solution
to
the
problem
facing
us
the
second
alternative
is
to
permit
the
market
price
for
these
agricultural
products
gradually
to
have
a
greater
influence
on
the
planning
of
production
by
farmers
while
continuing
the
assistance
of
the
government
this
is
the
sound
approach
to
make
it
effective
surpluses
existing
when
the
new
program
begins
must
be
insulated
from
the
normal
channels
of
trade
for
special
uses
these
uses
would
include
school
lunch
programs
disaster
relief
emergency
assistance
to
foreign
friends
and
of
particular
importance
the
stockpiling
of
reserves
for
a
national
emergency
building
on
the
agricultural
laws
of
and
we
should
establish
a
price
support
program
with
enough
flexibility
to
attract
the
production
of
needed
supplies
of
essential
commodities
and
to
stimulate
the
consumption
of
those
commodities
that
are
flooding
american
markets
transition
to
modernized
parity
must
be
accomplished
gradually
in
no
case
should
there
be
an
abrupt
downward
change
in
the
dollar
level
or
in
the
percentage
level
of
price
supports
next
monday
i
shall
transmit
to
the
congress
my
detailed
recommendations
embodying
this
approach
they
have
been
developed
through
the
cooperation
of
innumerable
individuals
vitally
interested
in
agriculture
my
special
message
on
monday
will
briefly
describe
the
consultative
and
advisory
processes
to
which
this
whole
program
has
been
subjected
during
the
past
ten
months
i
have
chosen
this
farm
program
because
it
will
build
markets
protect
the
consumers
food
supply
and
move
food
into
consumption
instead
of
into
storage
it
is
a
program
that
will
remove
the
threat
to
the
farmer
of
these
overhanging
surpluses
a
program
also
that
will
stimulate
production
when
a
commodity
is
scarce
and
encourage
consumption
when
nature
is
bountiful
moreover
it
will
promote
the
individual
freedom
responsibility
and
initiative
which
distinguish
american
agriculture
and
by
helping
our
agriculture
achieve
full
parity
in
the
market
it
promises
our
farmers
a
higher
and
steadier
financial
return
over
the
years
than
any
alternative
plan
conservation
part
of
our
nations
precious
heritage
is
its
natural
resources
it
is
the
common
responsibility
of
federal
state
and
local
governments
to
improve
and
develop
them
always
working
in
the
closest
harmony
and
partnership
all
federal
conservation
and
resource
development
projects
are
being
reappraised
sound
projects
now
under
way
will
be
continued
new
projects
in
which
the
federal
government
has
a
part
must
be
economically
sound
with
local
sharing
of
cost
wherever
appropriate
and
feasible
in
the
next
fiscal
year
work
will
be
started
on
twentythree
projects
that
meet
these
standards
the
federal
government
will
continue
to
construct
and
operate
economically
sound
flood
control
power
irrigation
and
water
supply
projects
wherever
these
projects
are
beyond
the
capacity
of
local
initiative
public
or
private
and
consistent
with
the
needs
of
the
whole
nation
our
conservation
program
will
also
take
into
account
the
important
role
played
by
farmers
in
protecting
our
soil
resources
i
recommend
enactment
of
legislation
to
strengthen
agricultural
conservation
and
upstream
flood
prevention
work
and
to
achieve
a
better
balance
with
major
flood
control
structures
in
the
downstream
areas
recommendations
will
be
made
from
time
to
time
for
the
adoption
of
a
uniform
and
consistent
water
resources
policy
a
revised
public
lands
policy
and
a
sound
program
for
safeguarding
the
domestic
production
of
critical
and
strategic
metals
and
minerals
in
addition
we
shall
continue
to
protect
and
improve
our
national
forests
parks
monuments
and
other
natural
and
historic
sites
as
well
as
our
fishery
and
wildlife
resources
i
hope
that
pending
legislation
to
improve
the
conservation
and
management
of
publiclyowned
grazing
lands
in
national
forests
will
soon
be
approved
by
the
congress
national
highways
to
protect
the
vital
interest
of
every
citizen
in
a
safe
and
adequate
highway
system
the
federal
government
is
continuing
its
central
role
in
the
federal
aid
highway
program
so
that
maximum
progress
can
be
made
to
overcome
present
inadequacies
in
the
interstate
highway
system
we
must
continue
the
federal
gasoline
tax
at
two
cents
per
gallon
this
will
require
cancellation
of
the
cent
decrease
which
otherwise
will
become
effective
april
st
and
will
maintain
revenues
so
that
an
expanded
highway
program
can
be
undertaken
when
the
commission
on
intergovernmental
relations
completes
its
study
of
the
present
system
of
financing
highway
construction
i
shall
promptly
submit
it
for
consideration
by
the
congress
and
the
governors
of
the
states
post
office
it
is
apparent
that
the
substantial
savings
already
made
and
to
be
made
by
the
post
office
department
cannot
eliminate
the
postal
deficit
i
recommend
therefore
that
the
congress
approve
the
bill
now
pending
in
the
house
of
representatives
providing
for
the
adjustment
of
certain
postal
rates
to
handle
the
long
term
aspects
of
this
i
also
recommend
that
the
congress
create
a
permanent
commission
to
establish
fair
and
reasonable
postal
rates
from
time
to
time
in
the
future
iii
human
problems
along
with
the
protection
of
freedom
and
maintenance
of
a
strong
and
growing
economy
this
administration
recognizes
a
third
great
purpose
of
government
concern
for
the
human
problems
of
our
citizens
in
a
modern
industrial
society
banishment
of
destitution
and
cushioning
the
shock
of
personal
disaster
on
the
individual
are
proper
concerns
of
all
levels
of
government
including
the
federal
government
this
is
especially
true
where
remedy
and
prevention
alike
are
beyond
the
individuals
capacity
labor
and
welfare
of
the
many
problems
in
this
area
those
i
shall
first
discuss
are
of
particular
concern
to
the
members
of
our
great
labor
force
who
with
their
heads
hearts
and
hands
produce
so
much
of
the
wealth
of
our
country
protection
against
the
hazards
of
temporary
unemployment
should
be
extended
to
some
millions
of
workers
including
civilian
federal
workers
who
now
lack
this
safeguard
moreover
the
secretary
of
labor
is
making
available
to
the
states
studies
and
recommendations
in
the
fields
of
weekly
benefits
periods
of
protection
and
extension
of
coverage
the
economic
report
will
consider
the
related
matter
of
minimum
wages
and
their
coverage
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
is
basically
a
sound
law
however
six
years
of
experience
have
revealed
that
in
some
respects
it
can
be
improved
on
january
i
shall
forward
to
the
congress
suggestions
for
changes
designed
to
reinforce
the
basic
objectives
of
the
act
our
basic
social
security
program
the
oldage
and
survivors
insurance
system
to
which
individuals
contribute
during
their
productive
years
and
receive
benefits
based
on
previous
earnings
is
designed
to
shield
them
from
destitution
last
year
i
recommended
extension
of
the
social
insurance
system
to
include
more
than
additional
persons
i
ask
that
this
extension
soon
be
accomplished
this
and
other
major
improvements
in
the
insurance
system
will
bring
substantial
benefit
increases
and
broaden
the
membership
of
the
insurance
system
thus
diminishing
the
need
for
federal
grantsinaid
for
such
purposes
a
new
formula
will
therefore
be
proposed
permitting
progressive
reduction
in
such
grants
as
the
need
for
them
declines
federal
grantinaid
welfare
programs
now
based
on
widely
varying
formulas
should
be
simplified
concrete
proposals
on
fourteen
of
them
will
be
suggested
t
o
the
appropriate
committees
the
program
for
rehabilitation
of
the
disabled
especially
needs
strengthening
through
special
vocational
training
this
program
presently
returns
each
year
some
handicapped
individuals
to
productive
work
far
more
disabled
people
can
be
saved
each
year
from
idleness
and
dependence
if
this
program
is
gradually
increased
my
more
detailed
recommendations
on
this
and
the
other
social
insurance
problems
i
have
mentioned
will
be
sent
to
the
congress
on
january
th
health
i
am
flatly
opposed
to
the
socialization
of
medicine
the
great
need
for
hospital
and
medical
services
can
best
be
met
by
the
initiative
of
private
plans
but
it
is
unfortunately
a
fact
that
medical
costs
are
rising
and
already
impose
severe
hardships
on
many
families
the
federal
government
can
do
many
helpful
things
and
still
carefully
avoid
the
socialization
of
medicine
the
federal
government
should
encourage
medical
research
in
its
battle
with
such
mortal
diseases
as
cancer
and
heart
ailments
and
should
continue
to
help
the
states
in
their
health
and
rehabilitation
programs
the
present
hospital
survey
and
construction
act
should
be
broadened
in
order
to
assist
in
the
development
of
adequate
facilities
for
the
chronically
ill
and
to
encourage
the
construction
of
diagnostic
centers
rehabilitation
facilities
and
nursing
homes
the
war
on
disease
also
needs
a
better
working
relationship
between
government
and
private
initiative
private
and
nonprofit
hospital
and
medical
insurance
plans
are
already
in
the
field
soundly
based
on
the
experience
and
initiative
of
the
people
in
their
various
communities
a
limited
government
reinsurance
service
would
permit
the
private
and
nonprofit
insurance
companies
to
offer
broader
protection
to
more
of
the
many
families
which
want
and
should
have
it
on
january
i
shall
forward
to
the
congress
a
special
message
presenting
this
administrations
health
program
in
its
detail
education
youthour
greatest
resourceis
being
seriously
neglected
in
a
vital
respect
the
nation
as
a
whole
is
not
preparing
teachers
or
building
schools
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
increase
in
our
population
the
preparation
of
teachers
as
indeed
the
control
and
direction
of
public
education
policy
is
a
state
and
local
responsibility
however
the
federal
government
should
stand
ready
to
assist
states
which
demonstrably
cannot
provide
sufficient
school
buildings
in
order
to
appraise
the
needs
i
hope
that
this
year
a
conference
on
education
will
be
held
in
each
state
culminating
in
a
national
conference
from
these
conferences
on
education
every
level

the
federal

to
each

which
to

the
details
of
a

to
the

veterans
administration
the
internal
reorganization
of
the
veterans
administration
is
proceeding
with
my
full
approval
when
completed
it
will
afford
a
single
agency
whose
services
including
medical
facilities
will
be
better
adapted
to
the
needs
of
those
veterans
to
whom
this
nation
owes
so
much
suffrage
my
few
remaining
recommendations
all
relate
to
a
basic
right
of
our
citizensthat
of
being
represented
in
the
decisions
of
the
government
i
hope
that
the
states
will
cooperate
with
the
congress
in
adopting
uniform
standards
in
their
voting
laws
that
will
make
it
possible
for
our
citizens
in
the
armed
forces
overseas
to
vote
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
time
is
long
overdue
for
granting
national
suffrage
to
its
citizens
and
also
applying
the
principle
of
local
selfgovernment
to
the
nations
capital
i
urge
the
congress
to
move
promptly
in
this
direction
and
also
to
revise
district
revenue
measures
to
provide
needed
public
works
improvements
the
people
of
hawaii
are
ready
for
statehood
i
renew
my
request
for
this
legislation
in
order
that
hawaii
may
elect
its
state
officials
and
its
representatives
in
washington
along
with
the
rest
of
the
country
this
fall
for
years
our
citizens
between
the
ages
of
and
have
in
time
of
peril
been
summoned
to
fight
for
america
they
should
participate
in
the
political
process
that
produces
this
fateful
summons
i
urge
congress
to
propose
to
the
states
a
constitutional
amendment
permitting
citizens
to
vote
when
they
reach
the
age
of
conclusion
i
want
to
add
one
final
word
about
the
general
purport
of
these
many
recommendations
our
governments
powers
are
wisely
limited
by
the
constitution
but
quite
apart
from
those
limitations
there
are
things
which
no
government
can
do
or
should
try
to
do
a
government
can
strive
as
ours
is
striving
to
maintain
an
economic
system
whose
doors
are
open
to
enterprise
and
ambitionthose
personal
qualities
on
which
economic
growth
largely
depends
but
enterprise
and
ambition
are
qualities
which
no
government
can
supply
fortunately
no
american
government
need
concern
itself
on
this
score
our
people
have
these
qualities
in
good
measure
a
government
can
sincerely
strive
for
peace
as
ours
is
striving
and
ask
its
people
to
make
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
peace
but
no
government
can
place
peace
in
the
hearts
of
foreign
rulers
it
is
our
duty
then
to
ourselves
and
to
freedom
itself
to
remain
strong
in
all
those
waysspiritual
economic
militarythat
will
give
us
maximum
safety
against
the
possibility
of
aggressive
action
by
others
no
government
can
inoculate
its
people
against
the
fatal
materialism
that
plagues
our
age
happily
our
people
though
blessed
with
more
material
goods
than
any
people
in
history
have
always
reserved
their
first
allegiance
to
the
kingdom
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
true
source
of
that
freedom
we
value
above
all
material
things
but
a
government
can
try
as
ours
tries
to
sense
the
deepest
aspirations
of
the
people
and
to
express
them
in
political
action
at
home
and
abroad
so
long
as
action
and
aspiration
humbly
and
earnestly
seek
favor
in
the
sight
of
the
almighty
there
is
no
end
to
americas
forward
road
there
is
no
obstacle
on
it
she
will
not
surmount
in
her
march
toward
a
lasting
peace
in
a
free
and
prosperous
world


to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
accord
with
my
constitutional
duty
i
transmit
herewith
to
the
congress
information
upon
the
state
of
the
union
together
with
recommendation
of
measures
for
its
consideration
our
country
is
at
peace
our
national
defense
has
been
maintained
at
a
high
state
of
effectiveness
all
of
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
have
been
conducted
during
the
year
with
a
high
devotion
to
public
interest
there
has
been
a
far
larger
degree
of
freedom
from
industrial
conflict
than
hitherto
known
education
and
science
have
made
further
advances
the
public
health
is
today
at
its
highest
known
level
while
we
have
recently
engaged
in
the
aggressive
contest
of
a
national
election
its
very
tranquillity
and
the
acceptance
of
its
results
furnish
abundant
proof
of
the
strength
of
our
institutions
in
the
face
of
widespread
hardship
our
people
have
demonstrated
daily
a
magnificent
sense
of
humanity
of
individual
and
community
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
the
less
fortunate
they
have
grown
in
their
conceptions
and
organization
for
cooperative
action
for
the
common
welfare
in
the
provision
against
distress
during
this
winter
the
great
private
agencies
of
the
country
have
been
mobilized
again
the
generosity
of
our
people
has
again
come
into
evidence
to
a
degree
in
which
all
america
may
take
great
pride
likewise
the
local
authorities
and
the
states
are
engaged
everywhere
in
supplemental
measures
of
relief
the
provisions
made
for
loans
from
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
to
states
that
have
exhausted
their
own
resources
guarantee
that
there
should
be
no
hunger
or
suffering
from
cold
in
the
country
the
large
majority
of
states
are
showing
a
sturdy
cooperation
in
the
spirit
of
the
federal
aid
the
surgeon
general
in
charge
of
the
public
health
service
furnishes
me

these
facts
indicate
the
fine
endeavor
of
the
agencies
which
have
been
mobilized
for
care
of
those
in
distress
economic
situation
the
unparalleled
worldwide
economic
depression
has
continued
through
the
year
due
to
the
european
collapse
the
situation
developed
during
last
fall
and
winter
into
a
series
of
most
acute
crises
the
unprecedented
emergency
measures
enacted
and
policies
adopted
undoubtedly
saved
the
country
from
economic
disaster
after
serving
to
defend
the
national
security
these
measures
began
in
july
to
show
their
weight
and
influence
toward
improvement
of
conditions
in
many
parts
of
the
country

the
measures

which
have
procured
this
turn
toward
recovery
should
be
continued
until
the
depression
is
passed
and
then
the

should
be
promptly
liquidated
the
expansion
of
credit
facilities
by
the
federal

system
and
the

has
been
of
incalculable
value
the

its
support

to

has
protected
the
savings

policies
of
millions
of
our
citizens
and
has
relieved
millions
of
borrowers
from
duress
they
have
enabled
industry

the

given
to
farm

the
establishment

in
their
various

have
placed
large
sums
of

at
the
disposal
of
the
people
in

beyond
this
the
extensive
organization
of
the

produced
profound
results

continued
constructive
policies
promoting
the
economic
recovery
of
the
country
must
be
the
paramount
duty
of
the
government
the
result
of
the
agencies
we
have
created
and
the
policies
we
have
pursued
has
been
to
buttress
our
whole
domestic
financial
structure
and
greatly
to
restore
credit
facilities
but
progress
in
recovery
requires
another
element
as
wellthat
is
fully
restored
confidence
in
the
future
institutions
and
men
may
have
resources
and
credit
but
unless
they
have
confidence
progress
is
halting
and
insecure
there
are
three
definite
directions
in
which
action
by
the
government
at
once
can
contribute
to
strengthen
further
the
forces
of
recovery
by
strengthening
of
confidence
they
are
the
necessary
foundations
to
any
other
action
and
their
accomplishment
would
at
once
promote
employment
and
increase
prices
the
first
of
these
directions
of
action
is
the
continuing
reduction
of
all
government
expenditures
whether
national
state
or
local
the
difficulties
of
the
country
demand
undiminished
efforts
toward
economy
in
government
in
every
direction
embraced
in
this
problem
is
the
unquestioned
balancing
of
the
federal
budget
that
is
the
first
necessity
of
national
stability
and
is
the
foundation
of
further
recovery
it
must
be
balanced
in
an
absolutely
safe
and
sure
manner
if
full
confidence
is
to
be
inspired
the
second
direction
for
action
is
the
complete
reorganization
at
once
of
our
banking
system
the
shocks
to
our
economic
life
have
undoubtedly
been
multiplied
by
the
weakness
of
this
system
and
until
they
are
remedied
recovery
will
be
greatly
hampered
the
third
direction
for
immediate
action
is
vigorous
and
whole
souled
cooperation
with
other
governments
in
the
economic
field
that
our
major
difficulties
find
their
origins
in
the
economic
weakness
of
foreign
nations
requires
no
demonstration
the
first
need
today
is
strengthening
of
commodity
prices
that
can
not
be
permanently
accomplished
by
artificialities
it
must
be
accomplished
by
expansion
in
consumption
of
goods
through
the
return
of
stability
and
confidence
in
the
world
at
large
and
that
in
turn
can
not
be
fully
accomplished
without
cooperation
with
other
nations
balancing
the
budget
i
shall
in
due
course
present
the
executive
budget
to
the
congress
it
will
show
proposed
reductions
in
appropriations
below
those
enacted
by
the
last
session
of
the
congress
by
over
in
addition
i
shall
present
the
necessary
executive
orders
under
the
recent
act
authorizing
the
reorganization
of
the
federal
government
which
if
permitted
to
go
into
force
will
produce
still
further
substantial
economies
these
sums
in
reduction
of
appropriations
will
however
be
partially
offset
by
an
increase
of
about
in
uncontrollable
items
such
as
increased
debt
services
etc
in
the
budget
there
is
included
only
the
completion
of
the
federal
public
works
projects
already
undertaken
or
under
contract
speeding
up
of
federal
public
works
during
the
past
four
years
as
an
aid
to
employment
has
advanced
many
types
of
such
improvements
to
the
point
where
further
expansion
can
not
be
justified
in
their
usefulness
to
the
government
or
the
people
as
an
aid
to
unemployment
we
should
beyond
the
normal
constructive
programs
substitute
reproductive
or
socalled
selfliquidating
works
loans
for
such
purposes
have
been
provided
for
through
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
this
change
in
character
of
projects
directly
relieves
the
taxpayer
and
is
capable
of
expansion
into
a
larger
field
than
the
direct
federal
works
the
reproductive
works
constitute
an
addition
to
national
wealth
and
to
future
employment
whereas
further
undue
expansion
of
federal
public
works
is
but
a
burden
upon
the
future
the
federal
construction
program
thus
limited
to
commitments
and
work
in
progress
under
the
proposed
appropriations
contemplates
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
including
naval
and
other
vessel
construction
as
well
as
other
forms
of
public
works
and
maintenance
of
a
total
of
as
compared
with
for
the
present
year
the
expenditure
on
such
items
over
the
four
years
ending
june
next
will
amount
to
or
an
amount
of
construction
work
eight
times
as
great
as
the
cost
of
the
panama
canal
and
except
for
completion
of
certain
longview
projects
places
the
nation
in
many
directions
well
ahead
of
its
requirements
for
some
years
to
come
a
normal
program
of
about
per
annum
should
hereafter
provide
for
the
countrys
necessities
and
will
permit
substantial
future
reduction
in
federal
expenditures
i
recommend
that
the
furlough
system
installed
last
year
be
continued
not
only
because
of
the
economy
produced
but
because
being
tantamount
to
the
day
week
it
sets
an
example
which
should
be
followed
by
the
country
and
because
it
embraces
within
its
workings
the
spread
work
principle
and
thus
serves
to
maintain
a
number
of
public
servants
who
would
otherwise
be
deprived
of
all
income
i
feel
however
in
view
of
the
present
economic
situation
and
the
decrease
in
the
cost
of
living
by
over
per
cent
that
some
further
sacrifice
should
be
made
by
salaried
officials
of
the
government
over
and
above
the
per
cent
reduction
under
the
furlough
system
i
will
recommend
that
after
exempting
the
first
of
salary
there
should
be
a
tem
porary
reduction
for
one
year
of
per
cent
of
that
part
of
all
government
salaries
in
excess
of
the
exemption
the
result
of
which
combined
with
the
furlough
system
will
average
about
per
cent
reduction
in
pay
to
those
earning
more
than
i
will
recommend
measures
to
eliminate
certain
payments
in
the
veterans
services
i
conceive
these
outlays
were
entirely
beyond
the
original
intentions
of
congress
in
building
up
veterans
allowances
many
abuses
have
grown
up
from
illconsidered
legislation
they
should
be
eliminated
the
nation
should
not
ask
for
a
reduction
in
allowances
to
men
and
dependents
whose
disabilities
rise
out
of
war
service
nor
to
those
veterans
with
substantial
service
who
have
become
totally
disabled
from
nonwarconnected
causes
and
who
are
at
the
same
time
without
other
support
these
latter
veterans
are
a
charge
on
the
community
at
some
point
and
i
feel
that
in
view
of
their
service
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
the
responsibility
should
fall
upon
the
federal
government
many
of
the
economies
recommended
in
the
budget
were
presented
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
but
failed
of
adoption
if
the
economy
and
appropriations
committees
of
the
congress
in
canvassing
these
proposed
expenditures
shall
find
further
reductions
which
can
be
made
without
impairing
essential
government
services
it
will
be
welcomed
both
by
the
country
and
by
myself
but
under
no
circumstances
do
i
feel
that
the
congress
should
fail
to
uphold
the
total
of
reductions
recommended
some
of
the
older
revenues
and
some
of
the
revenues
provided
under
the
act
passed
during
the
last
session
of
the
congress
particularly
those
generally
referred
to
as
the
nuisance
taxes
have
not
been
as
prolific
of
income
as
had
been
hoped
further
revenue
is
necessary
in
addition
to
the
amount
of
reductions
in
expenditures
recommended
many
of
the
manufacturers
excise
taxes
upon
selected
industries
not
only
failed
to
produce
satisfactory
revenue
but
they
are
in
many
ways
unjust
and
discriminatory
the
time
has
come
when
if
the
government
is
to
have
an
adequate
basis
of
revenue
to
assure
a
balanced
budget
this
system
of
special
manufacturers
excise
taxes
should
be
extended
to
cover
practically
all
manufactures
at
a
uniform
rate
except
necessary
food
and
possibly
some
grades
of
clothing
at
the
last
session
the
congress
responded
to
my
request
for
authority
to
reorganize
the
government
departments
the
act
provides
for
the
grouping
and
consolidation
of
executive
and
administrative
agencies
according
to
major
purpose
and
thereby
reducing
the
number
and
overlap
and
duplication
of
effort
executive
orders
issued
for
these
purposes
are
required
to
be
transmitted
to
the
congress
while
in
session
and
do
not
become
effective
until
after
the
expiration
of
calendar
days
after
such
transmission
unless
the
congress
shall
sooner
approve
i
shall
issue
such
executive
orders
within
a
few
days
grouping
or
consolidating
over
fifty
executive
and
administrative
agencies
including
a
large
number
of
commissions
and
independent
agencies
the
second
step
of
course
remains
that
after
these
various
bureaus
and
agencies
are
placed
cheek
by
jowl
into
such
groups
the
administrative
officers
in
charge
of
the
groups
shall
eliminate
their
overlap
and
still
further
consolidate
these
activities
therein
lie
large
economies
the
congress
must
be
warned
that
a
host
of
interested
persons
inside
and
outside
the
government
whose
vision
is
concentrated
on
some
particular
function
will
at
once
protest
against
these
proposals
these
same
sorts
of
activities
have
prevented
reorganization
of
the
government
for
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
they
must
be
disregarded
if
the
task
is
to
be
accomplished
banking
the
basis
of
every
other
and
every
further
effort
toward
recovery
is
to
reorganize
at
once
our
banking
system
the
shocks
to
our
economic
system
have
undoubtedly
multiplied
by
the
weakness
of
our
financial
system
i
first
called
attention
of
the
congress
in
to
this
condition
and
i
have
unceasingly
recommended
remedy
since
that
time
the
subject
has
been
exhaustively
investigated
both
by
the
committees
of
the
congress
and
the
officers
of
the
federal
reserve
system
the
banking
and
financial
system
is
presumed
to
serve
in
furnishing
the
essential
lubricant
to
the
wheels
of
industry
agriculture
and
commerce
that
is
credit
its
diversion
from
proper
use
its
improper
use
or
its
insufficiency
instantly
brings
hardship
and
dislocation
in
economic
life
as
a
system
our
banking
has
failed
to
meet
this
great
emergency
it
can
be
said
without
question
of
doubt
that
our
losses
and
distress
have
been
greatly
augmented
by
its
wholly
inadequate
organization
its
inability
as
a
system
to
respond
to
our
needs
is
today
a
constant
drain
upon
progress
toward
recovery
in
this
statement
i
am
not
referring
to
individual
banks
or
bankers
thousands
of
them
have
shown
distinguished
courage
and
ability
on
the
contrary
i
am
referring
to
the
system
itself
which
is
so
organized
or
so
lacking
in
organization
that
in
an
emergency
its
very
mechanism
jeopardizes
or
paralyzes
the
action
of
sound
banks
and
its
instability
is
responsible
for
periodic
dangers
to
our
whole
economic
system
bank
failures
rose
in
to
per
cent
of
all
the
banks
as
compared
to
per
cent
of
the
failures
of
all
other
types
of
enterprise
since
january
we
have
had
banks
suspend
with
in
deposits
partly
from
fears
and
drains
from
abroad
partly
from
these
failures
themselves
which
indeed
often
caused
closing
of
sound
banks
we
have
witnessed
hoarding
of
currency
to
an
enormous
sum
rising
during
the
height
of
the
crisis
to
over
the
results
from
interreaction
of
cause
and
effect
have
expressed
themselves
in
strangulation
of
credit
which
at
times
has
almost
stifled
the
nations
business
and
agriculture
the
losses
suffering
and
tragedies
of
our
people
are
incalculable
not
alone
do
they
lie
in
the
losses
of
savings
to
millions
of
homes
injury
by
deprival
of
working
capital
to
thousands
of
small
businesses
but
also
in
the
frantic
pressure
to
recall
loans
to
meet
pressures
of
hoarding
and
in
liquidation
of
failed
banks
millions
of
other
people
have
suffered
in
the
loss
of
their
homes
and
farms
businesses
have
been
ruined
unemployment
increased
and
farmers
prices
diminished
that
this
failure
to
function
is
unnecessary
and
is
the
fault
of
our
particular
system
is
plainly
indicated
by
the
fact
that
in
great
britain
where
the
economic
mechanism
has
suffered
far
greater
shocks
than
our
own
there
has
not
been
a
single
bank
failure
during
the
depression
again
in
canada
where
the
situation
has
been
in
large
degree
identical
with
our
own
there
have
not
been
substantial
bank
failures
the
creation
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
and
the
amendments
to
the
federal
reserve
act
served
to
defend
the
nation
in
a
great
crisis
they
are
not
remedies
they
are
relief
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
reconstruction
corporation
which
has
extended
aid
to
nearly
institutions
and
is
manifestly
but
a
temporary
device
can
go
on
indefinitely
it
is
today
a
matter
of
satisfaction
that
the
rate
of
bank
failures
of
hoarding
and
the
demands
upon
the
reconstruction
corporation
have
greatly
lessened
the
acute
phases
of
the
crisis
have
obviously
passed
and
the
time
has
now
come
when
this
national
danger
and
this
failure
to
respond
to
national
necessities
must
be
ended
and
the
measures
to
end
them
can
be
safely
undertaken
methods
of
reform
have
been
exhaustively
examined
there
is
no
reason
now
why
solution
should
not
be
found
at
the
present
session
of
the
congress
inflation
of
currency
or
governmental
conduct
of
banking
can
have
no
part
in
these
reforms
the
government
must
abide
within
the
field
of
constructive
organization
regulation
and
the
enforcement
of
safe
practices
only
parallel
with
reform
in
the
banking
laws
must
be
changes
in
the
federal
farm
loan
banking
system
and
in
the
joint
stock
land
banks
some
of
these
changes
should
be
directed
to
permanent
improvement
and
some
to
emergency
aid
to
our
people
where
they
wish
to
fight
to
save
their
farms
and
homes
i
wish
again
to
emphasize
this
viewthat
these
widespread
banking
reforms
are
a
national
necessity
and
are
the
first
requisites
for
further
recovery
in
agriculture
and
business
they
should
have
immediate
consideration
as
steps
greatly
needed
to
further
recovery
economic
cooperation
with
other
nations
our
major
difficulties
during
the
past
two
years
find
their
origins
in
the
shocks
from
economic
collapse
abroad
which
in
turn
are
the
aftermath
of
the
great
war
if
we
are
to
secure
rapid
and
assured
recovery
and
protection
for
the
future
we
must
cooperate
with
foreign
nations
in
many
measures
we
have
actively
engaged
in
a
world
disarmament
conference
where
with
success
we
should
reduce
our
own
tax
burdens
and
the
tax
burdens
of
other
major
nations
we
should
increase
political
stability
of
the
world
we
should
lessen
the
danger
of
war
by
increasing
defensive
powers
and
decreasing
offensive
powers
of
nations
we
would
thus
open
new
vistas
of
economic
expansion
for
the
world
we
are
participating
in
the
formulation
of
a
world
economic
conference
successful
results
from
which
would
contribute
much
to
advance
in
agricultural
prices
employment
and
business
currency
depreciation
and
correlated
forces
have
contributed
greatly
to
decrease
in
price
levels
moreover
from
these
origins
rise
most
of
the
destructive
trade
barriers
now
stifling
the
commerce
of
the
world
we
could
by
successful
action
increase
security
and
expand
trade
through
stability
in
international
exchange
and
monetary
values
by
such
action
world
confidence
could
be
restored
it
would
bring
courage
and
stability
which
will
reflect
into
every
home
in
our
land
the
european
governments
obligated
to
us
in
war
debts
have
requested
that
there
should
be
suspension
of
payments
due
the
united
states
on
december
next
to
be
accompanied
by
exchange
of
views
upon
this
debt
question
our
government
has
informed
them
that
we
do
not
approve
of
suspension
of
the
december
payments
i
have
stated
that
i
would
recommend
to
the
congress
methods
to
overc
ome
temporary
exchange
difficulties
in
connection
with
this
payment
from
nations
where
it
may
be
necessary
in
the
meantime
i
wish
to
reiterate
that
here
are
three
great
fields
of
international
action
which
must
be
considered
not
in
part
but
as
a
whole
they
are
of
most
vital
interest
to
our
people
within
them
there
are
not
only
grave
dangers
if
we
fail
in
right
action
but
there
also
tie
immense
opportunities
for
good
if
we
shall
succeed
within
success
there
lie
major
remedies
for
our
economic
distress
and
major
progress
in
stability
and
security
to
every
fireside
in
our
country
the
welfare
of
our
people
is
dependent
upon
successful
issue
of
the
great
causes
of
world
peace
world
disarmament
and
organized
world
recovery
nor
is
it
too
much
to
say
that
today
as
never
before
the
welfare
of
mankind
and
the
preservation
of
civilization
depend
upon
our
solution
of
these
questions
such
solutions
can
not
be
attained
except
by
honest
friendship
by
adherence
to
agreements
entered
upon
until
mutually
revised
and
by
cooperation
amongst
nations
in
a
determination
to
find
solutions
which
will
be
mutually
beneficial
other
legislation
i
have
placed
various
legislative
needs
before
the
congress
in
previous
messages
and
these
views
require
no
amplification
on
this
occasion
i
have
urged
the
need
for
reform
in
our
transportation
and
power
regulation
in
the
antitrust
laws
as
applied
to
our
national
resource
industries
western
range
conservation
extension
of
federal
aid
to
child
health
services
membership
in
the
world
court
the
ratification
of
the
great
lakesst
lawrence
seaway
treaty
revision
of
the
bankruptcy
acts
revision
of
federal
court
procedure
and
many
other
pressing
problems
these
and
other
special
subjects
i
shall
where
necessary
deal
with
by
special
communications
to
the
congress
the
activities
of
our
government
are
so
great
when
combined
with
the
emergency
activities
which
have
arisen
out
of
the
world
crisis
that
even
the
briefest
review
of
them
would
render
the
annual
message
unduly
long
i
shall
therefore
avail
myself
of
the
fact
that
every
detail
of
the
government
is
covered
in
the
reports
to
the
congress
by
each
of
the
departments
and
agencies
of
the
government
conclusion
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
upon
this
occasion
to
make
certain
general
observations
upon
the
principles
which
must
dominate
the
solution
of
problems
now
pressing
upon
the
nation
legislation
in
response
to
national
needs
will
be
effective
only
if
every
such
act
conforms
to
a
complete
philosophy
of
the
peoples
purposes
and
destiny
ours
is
a
distinctive
government
with
a
unique
history
and
background
consciously
dedicated
to
specific
ideals
of
liberty
and
to
a
faith
in
the
inviolable
sanctity
of
the
individual
human
spirit
furthermore
the
continued
existence
and
adequate
functioning
of
our
government
in
preservation
of
ordered
liberty
and
stimulation
of
progress
depends
upon
the
maintenance
of
state
local
institutional
and
individual
sense
of
responsibility
we
have
builded
a
system
of
individualism
peculiarly
our
own
which
must
not
be
forgotten
in
any
governmental
acts
for
from
it
have
grown
greater
accomplishments
than
those
of
any
other
nation
on
the
social
and
economic
sides
the
background
of
our
american
system
and
the
motivation
of
progress
is
essentially
that
we
should
allow
free
play
of
social
and
economic
forces
as
far
as
will
not
limit
equality
of
opportunity
and
as
will
at
the
same
time
stimulate
the
initiative
and
enterprise
of
our
people
in
the
maintenance
of
this
balance
the
federal
government
can
permit
of
no
privilege
to
any
person
or
group
it
should
act
as
a
regulatory
agent
and
not
as
a
participant
in
economic
and
social
life
the
moment
the
government
participates
it
becomes
a
competitor
with
the
people
as
a
competitor
it
becomes
at
once
a
tyranny
in
whatever
direction
it
may
touch
we
have
around
us
numerous
such
experiences
no
one
of
which
can
be
found
to
have
justified
itself
except
in
cases
where
the
people
as
a
whole
have
met
forces
beyond
their
control
such
as
those
of
the
great
war
and
this
great
depression
where
the
full
powers
of
the
federal
government
must
be
exerted
to
protect
the
people
but
even
these
must
be
limited
to
an
emergency
sense
and
must
be
promptly
ended
when
these
dangers
are
overcome
with
the
free
development
of
science
and
the
consequent
multitude
of
inventions
some
of
which
are
absolutely
revolutionary
in
our
national
life
the
government
must
not
only
stimulate
the
social
and
economic
responsibility
of
individuals
and
private
institutions
but
it
must
also
give
leadership
to
cooperative
action
amongst
the
people
which
will
soften
the
effect
of
these
revolutions
and
thus
secure
social
transformations
in
an
orderly
manner
the
highest
form
of
selfgovernment
is
the
voluntary
cooperation
within
our
people
for
such
purposes
but
i
would
emphasize
again
that
social
and
economic
solutions
as
such
will
not
avail
to
satisfy
the
aspirations
of
the
people
unless
they
conform
with
the
traditions
of
our
race
deeply
grooved
in
their
sentiments
through
a
century
and
a
half
of
struggle
for
ideals
of
life
that
are
rooted
in
religion
and
fed
from
purely
spiritual
springs
herbert

it
is
my
duty
under
the
constitution
to
transmit
to
the
congress
information
on
the
state
of
the
union
and
to
recommend
for
its
consideration
necessary
and
expedient
measures
the
chief
influence
affecting
the
state
of
the
union
during
the
past
year
has
been
the
continued
worldwide
economic
disturbance
our
national
concern
has
been
to
meet
the
emergencies
it
has
created
for
us
and
to
lay
the
foundations
for
recovery
if
we
lift
our
vision
beyond
these
immediate
emergencies
we
find
fundamental
national
gains
even
amid
depression
in
meeting
the
problems
of
this
difficult
period
we
have
witnessed
a
remarkable
development
of
the
sense
of
cooperation
in
the
community
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
our
major
economic
depressions
there
has
been
a
notable
absence
of
public
disorders
and
industrial
conflict
above
all
there
is
an
enlargement
of
social
and
spiritual
responsibility
among
the
people
the
strains
and
stresses
upon
business
have
resulted
in
closer
application
in
saner
policies
and
in
better
methods
public
improvements
have
been
carried
out
on
a
larger
scale
than
even
in
normal
times
the
country
is
richer
in
physical
property
in
newly
discovered
resources
and
in
productive
capacity
than
ever
before
there
has
been
constant
gain
in
knowledge
and

there
has
been
continuous
advance
in
science
and
invention
there
has
been
distinct
gain
in
public
health
business
depressions
have
been
recurrent
in
the
life
of
our
country
and
are
but
transitory
the
nation
has
emerged
from
each
of
them
with
increased
strength
and
virility
because
of
the
enlightenment
they
have
brought
the
readjustments
and
the
larger
understanding
of
the
realities
and
obligations
of
life
and
work
which
come
from
them
national
defense
both
our
army
and
navy
have
been
maintained
in
a
high
state
of
efficiency
the
ability
and
devotion
of
both
officers
and
men
sustain
the
highest
traditions
of
the
service
reductions
and
postponements
in
expenditure
of
these
departments
to
meet
the
present
emergency
are
being
made
without
reducing
existing
personnel
or
impairing
the
morale
of
either
establishment
the
agreement
between
the
leading
naval
powers
for
limitation
of
naval
armaments
and
establishment
of
their
relative
strength
and
thus
elimination
of
competitive
building
also
implies
for
ourselves
the
gradual
expansion
of
the
deficient
categories
in
our
navy
to
the
parities
provided
in
those
treaties
however
none
of
the
other
nations
parties
to
these
agreements
is
today
maintaining
the
full
rate
of
construction
which
the
treaty
size
of
fleets
would
imply
although
these
agreements
secured
the
maximum
reduction
of
fleets
which
it
was
at
that
time
possible
to
attain
i
am
hopeful
that
the
naval
powers
party
to
these
agreements
will
realize
that
establishment
of
relative
strength
in
itself
offers
opportunity
for
further
reduction
without
injury
to
any
of
them
this
would
be
the
more
possible
if
pending
negotiations
are
successful
between
france
and
italy
if
the
world
is
to
regain
its
standards
of
life
it
must
further
decrease
both
naval
and
other
arms
the
subject
will
come
before
the
general
disarmament
conference
which
meets
in
geneva
on
february
foreign
affairs
we
are
at
peace
with
the
world
we
have
cooperated
with
other
nations
to
preserve
peace
the
rights
of
our
citizens
abroad
have
been
protected
the
economic
depression
has
continued
and
deepened
in
every
part
of
the
world
during
the
past
year
in
many
countries
political
instability
excessive
armaments
debts
governmental
expenditures
and
taxes
have
resulted
in
revolutions
in
unbalanced
budgets
and
monetary
collapse
and
financial
panics
in
dumping
of
goods
upon
world
markets
and
in
diminished
consumption
of
commodities
within
two
years
there
have
been
revolutions
or
acute
social
disorders
in
countries
embracing
more
than
half
the
population
of
the
world
ten
countries
have
been
unable
to
meet
their
external
obligations
in
countries
embracing
a
quarter
of
the
worlds
population
former
monetary
standards
have
been
temporarily
abandoned
in
a
number
of
countries
there
have
been
acute
financial
panics
or
compulsory
restraints
upon
banking
these
disturbances
have
many
roots
in
the
dislocations
from
the
world
war
every
one
of
them
has
reacted
upon
us
they
have
sharply
affected
the
markets
and
prices
of
our
agricultural
and
industrial
products
they
have
increased
unemployment
and
greatly
embarrassed
our
financial
and
credit
system
as
our
difficulties
during
the
past
year
have
plainly
originated
in
large
degree
from
these
sources
any
effort
to
bring
about
our
own
recuperation
has
dictated
the
necessity
of
cooperation
by
us
with
other
nations
in
reasonable
effort
to
restore
world
confidence
and
economic
stability
cooperation
of
our
federal
reserve
system
and
our
banks
with
the
central
banks
in
foreign
countries
has
contributed
to
localize
and
ameliorate
a
number
of
serious
financial
crises
or
moderate
the
pressures
upon
us
and
thus
avert
disasters
which
would
have
affected
us
the
economic
crisis
in
germany
and
central
europe
last
june
rose
to
the
dimensions
of
a
general
panic
from
which
it
was
apparent
that
without
assistance
these
nations
must
collapse
apprehensions
of
such
collapse
had
demoralized
our
agricultural
and
security
markets
and
so
threatened
other
nations
as
to
impose
further
dangers
upon
us
but
of
highest
importance
was
the
necessity
of
cooperation
on
our
part
to
relieve
the
people
of
germany
from
imminent
disasters
and
to
maintain
their
important
relations
to
progress
and
stability
in
the
world
upon
the
initiative
of
this
government
a
years
postponement
of
reparations
and
other
intergovernmental
debts
was
brought
about
upon
our
further
initiative
an
agreement
was
made
by
germanys
private
creditors
providing
for
an
extension
of
such
credits
until
the
german
people
can
develop
more
permanent
and
definite
forms
of
relief
we
have
continued
our
policy
of
withdrawing
our
marines
from
haiti
and
nicaragua
the
difficulties
between
china
and
japan
have
given
us
great
concern
not
alone
for
the
maintenance
of
the
spirit
of
the
kelloggbriand
pact
but
for
the
maintenance
of
the
treaties
to
which
we
are
a
party
assuring
the
territorial
integrity
of
china
it
is
our
purpose
to
assist
in
finding
solutions
sustaining
the
full
spirit
of
those
treaties
i
shall
deal
at
greater
length
with
our
foreign
relations
in
a
later
message
the
domestic
situation
many
undertakings
have
been
organized
and
forwarded
during
the
past
year
to
meet
the
new
and
changing
emergencies
which
have
constantly
confronted
us
broadly
the
community
has
cooperated
to
meet
the
needs
of
honest
distress
and
to
take
such
emergency
measures
as
would
sustain
confidence
in
our
financial
system
and
would
cushion
the
violence
of
liquidation
in
industry
and
commerce
thus
giving
time
for
orderly
readjustment
of
costs
inventories
and
credits
without
panic
and
widespread
bankruptcy
these
measures
have
served
those
purposes
and
will
promote
recovery
in
these
measures
we
have
striven
to
mobilize
and
stimulate
private
initiative
and
local
and
community
responsibility
there
has
been
the
least
possible
government
entry
into
the
economic
field
and
that
only
in
temporary
and
emergency
form
our
citizens
and
our
local
governments
have
given
a
magnificent
display
of
unity
and
action
initiative
and
patriotism
in
solving
a
multitude
of
difficulties
and
in
cooperating
with
the
federal
government
for
a
proper
understanding
of
my
recommendations
to
the
congress
it
is
desirable
very
briefly
to
review
such
activities
during
the
past
year
the
emergencies
of
unemployment
have
been
met
by
action
in
many
directions
the
appropriations
for
the
continued
speeding
up
of
the
great
federal
construction
program
have
provided
direct
and
indirect
aid
to
employment
upon
a
large
scale
by
organized
unity
of
action
the
states
and
municipalities
have
also
maintained
large
programs
of
public
improvement
many
industries
have
been
prevailed
upon
to
anticipate
and
intensify
construction
industrial
concerns
and
other
employers
have
been
organized
to
spread
available
work
amongst
all
their
employees
instead
of
discharging
a
portion
of
them
a
large
majority
have
maintained
wages
at
as
high
levels
as
the
safe
conduct
of
their
business
would
permit
this
course
has
saved
us
from
industrial
conflict
and
disorder
which
have
characterized
all
previous
depressions
immigration
has
been
curtailed
by
administrative
action
upon
the
basis
of
normal
immigration
the
decrease
amounts
to
about
individuals
who
otherwise
would
have
been
added
to
our
unemployment
the
expansion
of
federal
employment
agencies
under
appropriations
by
the
congress
has
proved
most
effective
through
the
presidents
organization
for
unemployment
relief
public
and
private
agencies
were
successfully
mobilized
last
winter
to
provide
employment
and
other
measures
against
distress
similar
organization
gives
assurance
against
suffering
during
the
coming
winter
committees
of
leading
citizens
are
now
active
at
practically
every
point
of
unemployment
in
the
large
majority
they
have
been
assured
the
funds
necessary
which
together
with
local
government
aids
will
meet
the
situation
a
few
exceptional
localities
will
be
further
organized
the
evidence
of
the
public
health
service
shows
an
actual
decrease
of
sickness
and
infant
and
general
mortality
below
normal
years
no
greater
proof
could
be
adduced
that
our
people
have
been
protected
from
hunger
and
cold
and
that
the
sense
of
social
responsibility
in
the
nation
has
responded
to
the
need
of
the
unfortunate
to
meet
the
emergencies
in
agriculture
the
loans
authorized
by
congress
for
rehabilitation
in
the
drought
areas
have
enabled
farmers
to
produce
abundant
crops
in
those
districts
the
red
cross
undertook
and
magnificently
administered
relief
for
over
drought
sufferers
last
winter
it
has
undertaken
this
year
to
administer
relief
to
sufferers
in
the
new
drought
area
of
certain
northwest
states
the
action
of
the
federal
farm
board
in
granting
credits
to
farm
cooperatives

saved
many
of
them
from
bankruptcy
and
increased
their
purpose
and
strength
by
enabling
farm
cooperatives
to
cushion
the
fall
in
prices
of
farm
products
in
and
the
board
secured
higher
prices
to
the
farmer
than
would
have
been
obtained
otherwise
although
the
benefits
of
this
action
were
partially
defeated
by
continued
world
overproduction
incident
to
this
action
the
failure
of
a
large
number
of
farmers
and
of
country
banks
was
averted
which
could
quite
possibly
have
spread
into
a
major
disaster
the
banks
in
the
south
have
cooperated
with
the
farm
board
in
creation
of
a
pool
for
the
better
marketing
of
accumulated
cotton
growers
have
been
materially
assisted
by
this
action
constant
effort
has
been
made
to
reduce
overproduction
in
relief
of
agriculture
and
to
promote
the
foreign
buying
of
agricultural
products
by
sustaining
economic
stability
abroad
to
meet
our
domestic
emergencies
in
credit
and
banking
arising
from
the
reaction
to
acute
crisis
abroad
the
national
credit
association
was
set
up
by
the
banks
with
resources
of
to
support
sound
banks
against
the
frightened
withdrawals
and
hoarding
it
is
giving
aid
to
reopen
solvent
banks
which
have
been
closed
federal
officials
have
brought
about
many
beneficial
unions
of
banks
and
have
employed
other
means
which
have
prevented
many
bank
closings
as
a
result
of
these
measures
the
hoarding
withdrawals
which
had
risen
to
over
per
week
after
the
british
crisis
have
substantially
ceased
further
measures
the
major
economic
forces
and
weaknesses
at
home
and
abroad
have
now
been
exposed
and
can
be
appraised
and
the
time
is
ripe
for
forward
action
to
expedite
our
recovery
although
some
of
the
causes
of
our
depression
are
due
to
speculation
inflation
of
securities
and
real
estate
unsound
foreign
investments
and
mismanagement
of
financial
institutions
yet
our
selfcontained
national
economy
with
its
matchless
strength
and
resources
would
have
enabled
us
to
recover
long
since
but
for
the
continued
dislocations
shocks
and
setbacks
from
abroad
whatever
the
causes
may
be
the
vast
liquidation
and
readjustments
which
have
taken
place
have
left
us
with
a
large
degree
of
credit
paralysis
which
together
with
the
situation
in
our
railways
and
the
conditions
abroad
are
now
the
outstanding
obstacles
to
recuperation
if
we
can
put
our
financial
resources
to
work
and
can
ameliorate
the
financial
situation
in
the
railways
i
am
confident
we
can
make
a
large
measure
of
recovery
independent
of
the
rest
of
the
world
a
strong
america
is
the
highest
contribution
to
world
stability
one
phase
of
the
credit
situation
is
indicated
in
the
banks
during
the
past
year
banks
representing
per
cent
of
our
total
deposits
have
been
closed
a
large
part
of
these
failures
have
been
caused
by
withdrawals
for
hoarding
as
distinguished
from
the
failures
early
in
the
depression
where
weakness
due
to
mismanagement
was
the
larger
cause
of
failure
despite
their
closing
many
of
them
will
pay
in
full
although
such
withdrawals
have
practically
ceased
yet
of
currency
was
previously
withdrawn
which
has
still
to
return
to
circulation
this
represents
a
large
reduction
of
the
ability
of
our
banks
to
extend
credit
which
would
otherwise
fertilize
industry
and
agriculture
furthermore
many
of
our
bankers
in
order
to
prepare
themselves
to
meet
possible
withdrawals
have
felt
compelled
to
call
in
loans
to
refuse
new
credits
and
to
realize
upon
securities
which
in
turn
has
demoralized
the
markets
the
paralysis
has
been
further
augmented
by
the
steady
increase
in
recent
years
of
the
proportion
of
bank
assets
invested
in
longterm
securities
such
as
mortgages
and
bonds
these
securities
tend
to
lose
their
liquidity
in
depression
or
temporarily
to
fall
in
value
so
that
the
ability
of
the
banks
to
meet
the
shock
of
sudden
withdrawal
is
greatly
lessened
and
the
restriction
of
all
kinds
of
credit
is
thereby
increased
the
continuing
credit
paralysis
has
operated
to
accentuate
the
deflation
and
liquidation
of
commodities
real
estate
and
securities
below
any
reasonable
basis
of
values
all
of
this
tends
to
stifle
business
especially
the
smaller
units
and
finally
expresses
itself
in
further
depression
of
prices
and
values
in
restriction
on
new
enterprise
and
in
increased
unemployment
the
situation
largely
arises
from
an
unjustified
lack
of
confidence
we
have
enormous
volumes
of
idle
money
in
the
banks
and
in
hoarding
we
do
not
require
more
money
or
working
capitalwe
need
to
put
what
we
have
to
work
the
fundamental
difficulties
which
have
brought
about
financial
strains
in
foreign
countries
do
not
exist
in
the
united
states
no
external
drain
on
our
resources
can
threaten
our
position
because
the
balance
of
international
payments
is
in
our
favor
we
owe
less
to
foreign
countries
than
they
owe
to
us
our
industries
are
efficiently
organized
our
currency
and
bank
deposits
are
protected
by
the
greatest
gold
reserve
in
history
our
first
step
toward
recovery
is
to
reestablish
confidence
and
thus
restore
the
flow
of
credit
which
is
the
very
basis
of
our
economic
life
we
must
put
some
steel
beams
in
the
foundations
of
our
credit
structure
it
is
our
duty
to
apply
the
full
strength
of
our
government
not
only
to
the
immediate
phases
but
to
provide
security
against
shocks
and
the
repetition
of
the
weaknesses
which
have
been
proven
the
recommendations
which
i
here
lay
before
the
congress
are
designed
to
meet
these
needs
by
strengthening
financial
industrial
and
agricultural
life
through
the
medium
of
our
existing
institutions
and
thus
to
avoid
the
entry
of
the
government
into
competition
with
private
business
federal
government
finance
the
first
requirement
of
confidence
and
of
economic
recovery
is
financial
stability
of
the
united
states
government
i
shall
deal
with
fiscal
questions
at
greater
length
in
the
budget
message
but
i
must
at
this
time
call
attention
to
the
magnitude
of
the
deficits
which
have
developed
and
the
resulting
necessity
for
determined
and
courageous
policies
these
deficits
arise
in
the
main
from
the
heavy
decrease
in
tax
receipts
due
to
the
depression
and
to
the
increase
in
expenditure
on
construction
in
aid
to
unemployment
aids
to
agriculture
and
upon
services
to
veterans
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
last
we
incurred
a
deficit
of
about
which
included
the
statutory
reduction
of
the
debt
and
represented
an
increase
of
the
national
debt
by
of
this
however
is
offset
by
increased
cash
balances
in
comparison
with
the
fiscal
year
there
is
indicated
a
fall
in
federal
receipts
for
the
present
fiscal
year
amounting
to
of
which
is
in
individual
and
corporate
income
taxes
alone
during
this
fiscal
year
there
will
be
an
increased
expenditure
as
compared
to
on
veterans
of
and
an
increased
expenditure
on
construction
work
which
may
reach
despite
large
economies
in
other
directions
we
have
an
indicated
deficit
including
the
statutory
retirement
of
the
debt
of
and
an
indicated
net
debt
increase
of
about
the
budget
for
the
fiscal
year
beginning
july
next
after
allowing
for
some
increase
of
taxes
under
the
present
laws
and
after
allowing
for
drastic
reduction
in
expenditures
still
indicates
a
deficit
of
after
offsetting
the
statutory
debt
retirements
this
would
indicate
an
increase
in
the
national
debt
for
the
fiscal
year
of
about
several
conclusions
are
inevitable
we
must
have
insistent
and
determined
reduction
in
government
expenses
we
must
face
a
temporary
increase
in
taxes
such
increase
should
not
cover
the
whole
of
these
deficits
or
it
will
retard
recovery
we
must
partially
finance
the
deficit
by
borrowing
it
is
my
view
that
the
amount
of
taxation
should
be
fixed
so
as
to
balance
the
budget
for
except
for
the
statutory
debt
retirement
such
government
receipts
would
assure
the
balance
of
the
following
years
budget
including
debt
retirement
it
is
my
further
view
that
the
additional
taxation
should
be
imposed
solely
as
an
emergency
measure
terminating
definitely
two
years
from
july
next
such
a
basis
will
give
confidence
in
the
determination
of
the
government
to
stabilize
its
finance
and
will
assure
taxpayers
of
its
temporary
character
even
with
increased
taxation
the
government
will
reach
the
utmost
safe
limit
of
its
borrowing
capacity
by
the
expenditures
for
which
we
are
already
obligated
and
the
recommendations
here
proposed
to
go
further
than
these
limits
in
either
expenditures
taxes
or
borrowing
will
destroy
confidence
denude
commerce
and
industry
of
its
resources
jeopardize
the
financial
system
and
actually
extend
unemployment
and
demoralize
agriculture
rather
than
relieve
it
federal
land
banks
i
recommend
that
the
congress
authorize
the
subscription
by
the
treasury
of
further
capital
to
the
federal
land
banks
to
be
retired
as
provided
in
the
original
act
or
when
funds
are
available
and
that
repayments
of
such
capital
be
treated
as
a
fund
available
for
further
subscriptions
in
the
same
manner
it
is
urgent
that
the
banks
be
supported
so
as
to
stabilize
the
market
values
of
their
bonds
and
thus
secure
capital
for
the
farmers
at
low
rates
that
they
may
continue
their
services
to
agriculture
and
that
they
may
meet
the
present
situation
with
consideration
to
the
farmers
deposits
in
closed
banks
a
method
should
be
devised
to
make
available
quickly
to
depositors
some
portion
of
their
deposits
in
closed
banks
as
the
assets
of
such
banks
may
warrant
such
provision
would
go
far
to
relieve
distress
in
a
multitude
of
families
would
stabilize
values
in
many
communities
and
would
liberate
working
capital
to
thousands
of
concerns
i
recommend
that
measures
be
enacted
promptly
to
accomplish
these
results
and
i
suggest
that
the
congress
should
consider
the
development
of
such
a
plan
through
the
federal
reserve
banks
homeloan
discount
banks
i
recommend
the
establishment
of
a
system
of
homeloan
discount
banks
as
the
necessary
companion
in
our
financial
structure
of
the
federal
reserve
banks
and
our
federal
land
banks
such
action
will
relieve
present
distressing
pressures
against
home
and
farm
property
owners
it
will
relieve
pressures
upon
and
give
added
strength
to
b
uilding
and
loan
associations
savings
banks
and
deposit
banks
engaged
in
extending
such
credits
such
action
would
further
decentralize
our
credit
structure
it
would
revive
residential
construction
and
employment
it
would
enable
such
loaning
institutions
more
effectually
to
promote
home
ownership
i
discussed
this
plan
at
some
length
in
a
statement
made
public
november
last
this
plan
has
been
warmly
indorsed
by
the
recent
national
conference
upon
home
ownership
and
housing
whose
members
were
designated
by
the
governors
of
the
states
and
the
groups
interested
reconstruction
finance
corporation
in
order
that
the
public
may
be
absolutely
assured
and
that
the
government
may
be
in
position
to
meet
any
public
necessity
i
recommend
that
an
emergency
reconstruction
corporation
of
the
nature
of
the
former
war
finance
corporation
should
be
established
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
use
such
an
instrumentality
very
extensively
the
very
existence
of
such
a
bulwark
will
strengthen
confidence
the
treasury
should
be
authorized
to
subscribe
a
reasonable
capital
to
it
and
it
should
be
given
authority
to
issue
its
own
debentures
it
should
be
placed
in
liquidation
at
the
end
of
two
years
its
purpose
is
that
by
strengthening
the
weak
spots
to
thus
liberate
the
full
strength
of
the
nations
resources
it
should
be
in
position
to
facilitate
exports
by
american
agencies
make
advances
to
agricultural
credit
agencies
where
necessary
to
protect
and
aid
the
agricultural
industry
to
make
temporary
advances
upon
proper
securities
to
established
industries
railways
and
financial
institutions
which
can
not
otherwise
secure
credit
and
where
such
advances
will
protect
the
credit
structure
and
stimulate
employment
its
functions
would
not
overlap
those
of
the
national
credit
corporation
federal
reserve
eligibility
on
october
th
i
issued
a
statement
that
i
should
recommend
to
the
congress
an
extension
during
emergencies
of
the
eligibility
provisions
in
the
federal
reserve
act
this
statement
was
approved
by
a
representative
gathering
of
the
members
of
both
houses
of
the
congress
including
members
of
the
appropriate
committees
it
was
approved
by
the
officials
of
the
treasury
department
and
i
understand
such
an
extension
has
been
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
banks
nothing
should
be
done
which
would
lower
the
safeguards
of
the
system
the
establishment
of
the
mortgagediscount
banks
herein
referred
to
will
also
contribute
to
further
reserve
strength
in
the
banks
without
inflation
banking
laws
our
people
have
a
right
to
a
banking
system
in
which
their
deposits
shall
be
safeguarded
and
the
flow
of
credit
less
subject
to
storms
the
need
of
a
sounder
system
is
plainly
shown
by
the
extent
of
bank
failures
i
recommend
the
prompt
improvement
of
the
banking
laws
changed
financial
conditions
and
commercial
practices
must
be
met
the
congress
should
investigate
the
need
for
separation
between
different
kinds
of
banking
an
enlargement
of
branch
banking
under
proper
restrictions
and
the
methods
by
which
enlarged
membership
in
the
federal
reserve
system
may
be
brought
about
postal
savings
banks
the
postal
savings
deposits
have
increased
from
about
to
about
during
the
past
year
this
experience
has
raised
important
practical
questions
in
relation
to
deposits
and
investments
which
should
receive
the
attention
of
the
congress
railways
the
railways
present
one
of
our
immediate
and
pressing
problems
they
are
and
must
remain
the
backbone
of
our
transportation
system
their
prosperity
is
interrelated
with
the
prosperity
of
all
industries
their
fundamental
service
in
transportation
the
volume
of
their
employment
their
buying
power
for
supplies
from
other
industries
the
enormous
investment
in
their
securities
particularly
their
bonds
by
insurance
companies
savings
banks
benevolent
and
other
trusts
all
reflect
their
partnership
in
the
whole
economic
fabric
through
these
institutions
the
railway
bonds
are
in
a
large
sense
the
investment
of
every
family
the
wellmaintained
and
successful
operation
and
the
stability
of
railway
finances
are
of
primary
importance
to
economic
recovery
they
should
have
more
effective
opportunity
to
reduce
operating
costs
by
proper
consolidation
as
their
rates
must
be
regulated
in
public
interest
so
also
approximate
regulation
should
be
applied
to
competing
services
by
some
authority
the
methods
of
their
regulation
should
be
revised
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
made
important
and
farreaching
recommendations
upon
the
whole
subject
which
i
commend
to
the
early
consideration
of
the
congress
antitrust
laws
in
my
message
of
a
year
ago
i
commented
on
the
necessity
of
congressional
inquiry
into
the
economic
action
of
the
antitrust
laws
there
is
wide
conviction
that
some
change
should
be
made
especially
in
the
procedure
under
these
laws
i
do
not
favor
their
repeal
such
action
would
open
wide
the
door
to
price
fixing
monopoly
and
destruction
of
healthy
competition
particular
attention
should
be
given
to
the
industries
rounded
upon
natural
resources
especially
where
destructive
competition
produces
great
wastes
of
these
resources
and
brings
great
hardships
upon
operators
employees
and
the
public
in
recent
years
there
has
been
continued
demoralization
in
the
bituminous
coal
oil
and
lumber
industries
i
again
commend
the
matter
to
the
consideration
of
the
congress
unemployment
as
an
aid
to
unemployment
the
federal
government
is
engaged
in
the
greatest
program
of
publicbuilding
harbor
floodcontrol
highway
waterway
aviation
merchant
and
naval
ship
construction
in
all
history
our
expenditures
on
these
works
during
this
calendar
year
will
reach
about
compared
with
in
through
this
increased
construction
through
the
maintenance
of
a
full
complement
of
federal
employees
and
through
services
to
veterans
it
is
estimated
that
the
federal
taxpayer
is
now
directly
contributing
to
the
livelihood
of
of
our
citizens
we
must
avoid
burdens
upon
the
government
which
will
create
more
unemployment
in
private
industry
than
can
be
gained
by
further
expansion
of
employment
by
the
federal
government
we
can
now
stimulate
employment
and
agriculture
more
effectually
and
speedily
through
the
voluntary
measures
in
progress
through
the
thawing
out
of
credit
through
the
building
up
of
stability
abroad
through
the
home
loan
discount
banks
through
an
emergency
finance
corporation
and
the
rehabilitation
of
the
railways
and
other
such
directions
i
am
opposed
to
any
direct
or
indirect
government
dole
the
breakdown
and
increased
unemployment
in
europe
is
due
in
part
to
such
practices
our
people
are
providing
against
distress
from
unemployment
in
true
american
fashion
by
a
magnificent
response
to
public
appeal
and
by
action
of
the
local
governments
general
legislation
there
are
many
other
subjects
requiring
legislative
action
at
this
session
of
the
congress
i
may
list
the
following
among
them
veterans
services
the
law
enacted
last
march
authorizing
loans
of
per
cent
upon
adjustedservice
certificates
has
together
with
the
loans
made
under
previous
laws
resulted
in
payments
of
about
appropriations
have
been
exhausted
the
administrator
of
veterans
affairs
advises
that
a
further
appropriation
of
is
required
at
once
to
meet
the
obligations
made
necessary
by
existing
legislation
there
will
be
demands
for
further
veterans
legislation
there
are
inequalities
in
our
system
of
veterans
relief
it
is
our
national
duty
to
meet
our
obligations
to
those
who
have
served
the
nation
but
our
present
expenditure
upon
these
services
now
exceeds
per
annum
i
am
opposed
to
any
extension
of
these
expenditures
until
the
country
has
recovered
from
the
present
situation
electricalpower
regulation
i
have
recommended
in
previous
messages
the
effective
regulation
of
interstate
electrical
power
as
the
essential
function
of
the
reorganized
federal
power
commission
i
renew
the
recommendation
it
is
urgently
needed
in
public
protection
muscle
shoals
at
my
suggestion
the
governors
and
legislatures
of
alabama
and
tennessee
selected
three
members
each
for
service
on
a
committee
to
which
i
appointed
a
representative
of
the
farm
organizations
and
two
representatives
of
the
war
department
for
the
purpose
of
recommending
a
plan
for
the
disposal
of
these
properties
which
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
people
of
those
states
and
the
agricultural
industry
throughout
the
country
i
shall
transmit
the
recommendations
to
the
congress
reorganization
of
federal
departments
i
have
referred
in
previous
messages
to
the
profound
need
of
further
reorganization
and
consolidation
of
federal
administrative
functions
to
eliminate
overlap
and
waste
and
to
enable
coordination
and
definition
of
government
policies
now
wholly
impossible
in
scattered
and
conflicting
agencies
which
deal
with
parts
of
the
same
major
function
i
shall
lay
before
the
congress
further
recommendations
upon
this
subject
particularly
in
relation
to
the
department
of
the
interior
there
are
two
directions
of
such
reorganization
however
which
have
an
important
bearing
upon
the
emergency
problems
with
which
we
are
confronted
shipping
board
at
present
the
shipping
board
exercises
large
administrative
functions
independent
of
the
executive
these
administrative
functions
should
be
transferred
to
the
department
of
commerce
in
keeping
with
that
single
responsibility
which
has
been
the
basis
of
our
governmental
structure
since
its
foundation
there
should
be
created
in
that
department
a
position
of
assistant
secretary
for
merchant
marine
under
whom
this
work
and
the
several
bureaus
having
to
do
with
merchant
marine
may
be
grouped
the
shipping
board
should
be
made
a
regulatory
body
acting
also
in
advisory
capacity
on
loans
and
policies
in
keeping
with
its
original
conception
its
regulatory
powers
should
be
amended
to
include
regulation
of
coastwise
shipping
so
as
to
assure
stability
and
better
service
it
is
also
worthy
of
consideration
that
the
regulation
of
rates
and
services
upon
the
inland
waterways
should
be
assigned
to
such
a
reorganized
board
reorganization
of

public
works
administration
i
recommend
that
all
building
and
construction
activities
of
the
government
now
carried
on
by
many
departments
be
consolidated
into
an
independent
establishment
under
the
president
to
be
known
as
the
public
works
administration
directed
by
a
public
works
administrator
this
agency
should
undertake
all
construction
work
in
service
to
the
different
departments
of
the
government
except
naval
and
military
work
the
services
of
the
corps
of
army
engineers
should
be
delegated
in
rotation
for
military
duty
to
this
administration
in
continuation
of
their
supervision
of
river
and
harbor
work
great
economies
sounder
policies
more
effective
coordination
to
employment
and
expedition
in
all
construction
work
would
result
from
this
consolidation
law
enforcement
i
shall
present
some
recommendations
in
a
special
message
looking
to
the
strengthening
of
criminallaw
enforcement
and
improvement
in
judicial
procedure
connected
therewith
inland
waterway
and
harbor
improvement
these
improvements
are
now
proceeding
upon
an
unprecedented
scale
some
indication
of
the
volume
of
work
in
progress
is
conveyed
by
the
fact
that
during
the
current
year
over
cubic
yards
of
material
have
been
movedan
amount
equal
to
the
entire
removal
in
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
the
mississippi
waterway
system
connecting
chicago
kansas
city
pittsburgh
and
new
orleans
will
be
in
full
operation
during
substantial
progress
is
being
made
upon
the
projects
of
the
upper
missouri
upper
mississippi
etc
negotiations
are
now
in
progress
with
canada
for
the
construction
of
the
st
lawrence
waterway
the
tariff
wages
and
standards
of
living
abroad
have
been
materially
lowered
during
the
past
year
the
temporary
abandonment
of
the
gold
standard
by
certain
countries
has
also
reduced
their
production
costs
compared
to
ours
fortunately
any
increases
in
the
tariff
which
may
be
necessary
to
protect
agriculture
and
industry
from
these
lowered
foreign
costs
or
decreases
in
items
which
may
prove
to
be
excessive
may
be
undertaken
at
any
time
by
the
tariff
commission
under
authority
which
it
possesses
by
virtue
of
the
tariff
act
of
the
commission
during
the
past
year
has
reviewed
the
rates
upon
over
items
subject
to
tariff
as
a
result
of
vigorous
and
industrious
action
it
is
up
to
date
in
the
consideration
of
pending
references
and
is
prepared
to
give
prompt
attention
to
any
further
applications
this
procedure
presents
an
orderly
method
for
correcting
inequalities
i
am
opposed
to
any
general
congressional
revision
of
the
tariff
such
action
would
disturb
industry
business
and
agriculture
it
would
prolong
the
depression
immigration
and
deportation
i
recommend
that
immigration
restriction
now
in
force
under
administrative
action
be
placed
upon
a
more
definite
basis
by
law
the
deportation
laws
should
be
strengthened
aliens
lawfully
in
the
country
should
be
protected
by
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
residence
public
health
i
again
call
attention
to
my
previous
recommendations
upon
this
subject
particularly
in
its
relation
to
children
the
moral
results
are
of
the
utmost
importance
conclusion
it
is
inevitable
that
in
these
times
much
of
the
legislation
proposed
to
the
congress
and
many
of
the
recommendations
of
the
executive
must
be
designed
to
meet
emergencies
in
reaching
solutions
we
must
not
jeopardize
those
principles
which
we
have
found
to
be
the
basis
of
the
growth
of
the
nation
the
federal
government
must
not
encroach
upon
nor
permit
local
communities
to
abandon
that
precious
possession
of
local
initiative
and
responsibility
again
just
as
the
largest
measure
of
responsibility
in
the
government
of
the
nation
rests
upon
local
selfgovernment
so
does
the
largest
measure
of
social
responsibility
in
our
country
rest
upon
the
individual
if
the
individual
surrenders
his
own
initiative
and
responsibilities
he
is
surrendering
his
own
freedom
and
his
own
liberty
it
is
the
duty
of
the
national
government
to
insist
that
both
the
local
governments
and
the
individual
shall
assume
and
bear
these
responsibilities
as
a
fundamental
of
preserving
the
very
basis
of
our
freedom
many
vital
changes
and
movements
of
vast
proportions
are
taking
place
in
the
economic
world
the
effect
of
these
changes
upon
the
future
can
not
be
seen
clearly
as
yet
of
this
however
we
are
sure
our
system
based
upon
the
ideals
of
individual
initiative
and
of
equality
of
opportunity
is
not
an
artificial
thing
rather
it
is
the
outgrowth
of
the
experience
of
america
and
expresses
the
faith
and
spirit
of
our
people
it
has
carried
us
in
a
century
and
a
half
to
leadership
of
the
economic
world
if
our
economic
system
does
not
match
our
highest
expectations
at
all
times
it
does
not
require
revolutionary
action
to
bring
it
into
accord
with
any
necessity
that
experience
may
prove
it
has
successfully
adjusted
itself
to
changing
conditions
in
the
past
it
will
do
so
again
the
mobility
of
our
institutions
the
richness
of
our
resources
and
the
abilities
of
our
people
enable
us
to
meet
them
unafraid
it
is
a
distressful
time
for
many
of
our
people
but
they
have
shown
qualities
as
high
in
fortitude
courage
and
resourcefulness
as
ever
in
our
history
with
that
spirit
i
have
faith
that
out
of
it
will
come
a
sounder
life
a
truer
standard
of
values
a
greater
recognition
of
the
results
of
honest
effort
and
a
healthier
atmosphere
in
which
to
rear
our
children
ours
must
be
a
country
of
such
stability
and
security
as
can
not
fail
to
carry
forward
and
enlarge
among
all
the
people
that
abundant
life
of
material
and
spiritual
opportunity
which
it
has
represented
among
all
nations
since
its
beginning
the
white
house
december

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
i
have
the
honor
to
comply
with
the
requirement
of
the
constitution
that
i
should
lay
before
the
congress
information
as
to
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommend
consideration
of
such
measures
as
are
necessary
and
expedient
substantial
progress
has
been
made
during
the
year
in
national
peace
and
security
the
fundamental
strength
of
the
nations
economic
life
is
unimpaired
education
and
scientific
discovery
have
made
advances
our
country
is
more
alive
to
its
problems
of
moral
and
spiritual
welfare
economic
situation
during
the
past
months
we
have
suffered
with
other
nations
from
economic
depression
the
origins
of
this
depression
lie
to
some
extent
within
our
own
borders
through
a
speculative
period
which
diverted
capital
and
energy
into
speculation
rather
than
constructive
enterprise
had
overspeculation
in
securities
been
the
only
force
operating
we
should
have
seen
recovery
many
months
ago
as
these
particular
dislocations
have
generally
readjusted
themselves
other
deepseated
causes
have
been
in
action
however
chiefly
the
worldwide
overproduction
beyond
even
the
demand
of
prosperous
times
for
such
important
basic
commodities
as
wheat
rubber
coffee
sugar
copper
silver
zinc
to
some
extent
cotton
and
other
raw
materials
the
cumulative
effects
of
demoralizing
price
falls
of
these
important
commodities
in
the
process
of
adjustment
of
production
to
world
consumption
have
produced
financial
crises
in
many
countries
and
have
diminished
the
buying
power
of
these
countries
for
imported
goods
to
a
degree
which
extended
the
difficulties
farther
afield
by
creating
unemployment
in
all
the
industrial
nations
the
political
agitation
in
asia
revolutions
in
south
america
and
political
unrest
in
some
european
states
the
methods
of
sale
by
russia
of
her
increasing
agricultural
exports
to
european
markets
and
our
own
droughthave
all
contributed
to
prolong
and
deepen
the
depression
in
the
larger
view
the
major
forces
of
the
depression
now
lie
outside
of
the
united
states
and
our
recuperation
has
been
retarded
by
the
unwarranted
degree
of
fear
and
apprehension
created
by
these
outside
forces
the
extent
of
the
depression
is
indicated
by
the
following
approximate
percentages
of
activity
during
the
past
three
months
as
compared
with
the
highly
prosperous
year
of

commodities
of
cost
of

of
various
other
indexes
indicate
total
decrease
of
activity
from
of
from
to
per
cent
there
are
many
factors
which
give
encouragement
for
the
future
the
fact
that
we
are
holding
from
to
per
cent
of
our
normal
activities
and
incomes
that
our
major
financial
and
industrial
institutions
have
come
through
the
storm
unimpaired
that
price
levels
of
major
commodities
have
remained
approximately
stable
for
some
time
that
a
number
of
industries
are
showing
signs
of
increasing
demand
that
the
world
at
large
is
readjusting
itself
to
the
situation
all
reflect
grounds
for
confidence
we
should
remember
that
these
occasions
have
been
met
many
times
before
that
they
are
but
temporary
that
our
country
is
today
stronger
and
richer
in
resources
in
equipment
in
skill
than
ever
in
its
history
we
are
in
an
extraordinary
degree
selfsustaining
we
will
overcome
world
influences
and
will
lead
the
march
of
prosperity
as
we
have
always
done
hitherto
economic
depression
can
not
be
cured
by
legislative
action
or
executive
pronouncement
economic
wounds
must
be
healed
by
the
action
of
the
cells
of
the
economic
bodythe
producers
and
consumers
themselves
recovery
can
be
expedited
and
its
effects
mitigated
by
cooperative
action
that
cooperation
requires
that
every
individual
should
sustain
faith
and
courage
that
each
should
maintain
his
selfreliance
that
each
and
every
one
should
search
for
methods
of
improving
his
business
or
service
that
the
vast
majority
whose
income
is
unimpaired
should
not
hoard
out
of
fear
but
should
pursue
their
normal
living
and
recreations
that
each
should
seek
to
assist
his
neighbors
who
may
be
less
fortunate
that
each
industry
should
assist
its
own
employees
that
each
community
and
each
state
should
assume
its
full
responsibilities
for
organization
of
employment
and
relief
of
distress
with
that
sturdiness
and
independence
which
built
a
great
nation
our
people
are
responding
to
these
impulses
in
remarkable
degree
the
best
contribution
of
government
lies
in
encouragement
of
this
voluntary
cooperation
in
the
community
the
government
national
state
and
local
can
join
with
the
community
in
such
programs
and
do
its
part
a
year
ago
i
together
with
other
officers
of
the
government
initiated
extensive
cooperative
measures
throughout
the
country
the
first
of
these
measures
was
an
agreement
of
leading
employers
to
maintain
the
standards
of
wages
and
of
labor
leaders
to
use
their
influence
against
strife
in
a
large
sense
these
undertakings
have
been
adhered
to
and
we
have
not
witnessed
the
usual
reductions
of
wages
which
have
always
heretofore
marked
depressions
the
index
of
union
wage
scales
shows
them
to
be
today
fully
up
to
the
level
of
any
of
the
previous
three
years
in
consequence
the
buying
power
of
the
country
has
been
much
larger
than
would
otherwise
have
been
the
case
of
equal
importance
the
nation
has
had
unusual
peace
in
industry
and
freedom
from
the
public
disorder
which
has
characterized
previous
depressions
the
second
direction
of
cooperation
has
been
that
our
governments
national
state
and
local
the
industries
and
business
so
distribute
employment
as
to
give
work
to
the
maximum
number
of
employees
the
third
direction
of
cooperation
has
been
to
maintain
and
even
extend
construction
work
and
betterments
in
anticipation
of
the
future
it
has
been
the
universal
experience
in
previous
depressions
that
public
works
and
private
construction
have
fallen
off
rapidly
with
the
general
tide
of
depression
on
this
occasion
however
the
increased
authorization
and
generous
appropriations
by
the
congress
and
the
action
of
states
and
municipalities
have
resulted
in
the
expansion
of
public
construction
to
an
amount
even
above
that
in
the
most
prosperous
years
in
addition
the
cooperation
of
public
utilities
railways
and
other
large
organizations
has
been
generously
given
in
construction
and
betterment
work
in
anticipation
of
future
need
the
department
of
commerce
advises
me
that
as
a
result
the
volume
of
this
type
of
construction
work
which
amounted
to
roughly
in
instead
of
decreasing
will
show
a
total
of
about
for
there
has
of
course
been
a
substantial
decrease
in
the
types
of
construction
which
could
not
be
undertaken
in
advance
of
need
the
fourth
direction
of
cooperation
was
the
organization
in
such
states
and
municipalities
as
was
deemed
necessary
of
committees
to
organize
local
employment
to
provide
for
employment
agencies
and
to
effect
relief
of
distress
the
result
of
magnificent
cooperation
throughout
the
country
has
been
that
actual
suffering
has
been
kept
to
a
minimum
during
the
past
months
and
our
unemployment
has
been
far
less
in
proportion
than
in
other
large
industrial
countries
some
time
ago
it
became
evident
that
unemployment
would
continue
over
the
winter
and
would
necessarily
be
added
to
from
seasonal
causes
and
that
the
savings
of
workpeople
would
be
more
largely
depleted
we
have
as
a
nation
a
definite
duty
to
see
that
no
deserving
person
in
our
country
suffers
from
hunger
or
cold
i
therefore
set
up
a
more
extensive
organization
to
stimulate
more
intensive
cooperation
throughout
the
country
there
has
been
a
most
gratifying
degree
of
response
from
governors
mayors
and
other
public
officials
from
welfare
organizations
and
from
employers
in
concerns
both
large
and
small
the
local
communities
through
their
voluntary
agencies
have
assumed
the
duty
of
relieving
individual
distress
and
are
being
generously
supported
by
the
public
the
number
of
those
wholly
out
of
employment
seeking
for
work
was
accurately
determined
by
the
census
last
april
as
about
the
department
of
labor
index
of
employment
in
the
larger
trades
shows
some
decrease
in
employment
since
that
time
the
problem
from
a
relief
point
of
view
is
somewhat
less
than
the
published
estimates
of
the
number
of
unemployed
would
indicate
the
intensive
community
and
individual
efforts
in
providing
special
employment
outside
the
listed
industries
are
not
reflected
in
the
statistical
indexes
and
tend
to
reduce
such
published
figures
moreover
there
is
estimated
to
be
a
constant
figure
at
all
times
of
nearly
unemployed
who
are
not
without
annual
income
but
temporarily
idle
in
the
shift
from
one
job
to
another
we
have
an
average
of
about
three
breadwinners
to
each
two
families
so
that
every
person
unemployed
does
not
represent
a
family
without
income
the
view
that
the
relief
problems
are
less
than
the
gross
numbers
would
indicate
is
confirmed
by
the
experience
of
several
cities
which
shows
that
the
number
of
families
in
distress
represents
from
to
per
cent
of
the
number
of
the
calculated
unemployed
this
is
not
said
to
minimize
the
very
real
problem
which
exists
but
to
weigh
its
actual
proportions
as
a
contribution
to
the
situation
the
federal
government
is
engaged
upon
the
greatest
program
of
waterway
harbor
flood
control
public
building
highway
and
airway
improvement
in
all
our
history
this
together
with
loans
to
merchant
shipbuilders
improvement
of
the
navy
and
in
military
aviation
and
other
construction
work
of
the
government
will
exceed
for
this
fiscal
year
this
compares
with
in
the
fiscal
year
the
construction
works
already
authorized
and
the
continuation
of
policies
in
government
aid
will
require
a
continual
expenditure
upwards
of
half
a
billion
dollars
annually
i
favor
still
further
temporary
expansion
of
these
activities
in
aid
to
unemployment
during
this
winter
the
congress
will
however
have
presented
to
it
numbers
of
projects
some
of
them
under
the
guise
of
rather
than
the
reality
of
the
ir
usefulness
in
the
increase
of
employment
during
the
depression
there
are
certain
commonsense
limitations
upon
any
expansions
of
construction
work
the
government
must
not
undertake
works
that
are
not
of
sound
economic
purpose
and
that
have
not
been
subject
to
searching
technical
investigation
and
which
have
not
been
given
adequate
consideration
by
the
congress
the
volume
of
construction
work
in
the
government
is
already
at
the
maximum
limit
warranted
by
financial
prudence
as
a
continuing
policy
to
increase
taxation
for
purposes
of
construction
work
defeats
its
own
purpose
as
such
taxes
directly
diminish
employment
in
private
industry
again
any
kind
of
construction
requires
after
its
authorization
a
considerable
time
before
labor
can
be
employed
in
which
to
make
engineering
architectural
and
legal
preparations
our
immediate
problem
is
the
increase
of
employment
for
the
next
six
months
and
new
plans
which
do
not
produce
such
immediate
result
or
which
extend
commitments
beyond
this
period
are
not
warranted
the
enlarged
rivers
and
harbors
public
building
and
highway
plans
authorized
by
the
congress
last
session
however
offer
an
opportunity
for
assistance
by
the
temporary
acceleration
of
construction
of
these
programs
even
faster
than
originally
planned
especially
if
the
technical
requirements
of
the
laws
which
entail
great
delays
could
be
amended
in
such
fashion
as
to
speed
up
acquirements
of
land
and
the
letting
of
contracts
with
view
however
to
the
possible
need
for
acceleration
we
immediately
upon
receiving
those
authorities
from
the
congress
five
months
ago
began
the
necessary
technical
work
in
preparation
for
such
possible
eventuality
i
have
canvassed
the
departments
of
the
government
as
to
the
maximum
amount
that
can
be
properly
added
to
our
present
expenditure
to
accelerate
all
construction
during
the
next
six
months
and
i
feel
warranted
in
asking
the
congress
for
an
appropriation
of
from
to
to
provide
such
further
employment
in
this
emergency
in
connection
therewith
we
need
some
authority
to
make
enlarged
temporary
advances
of
federalhighway
aid
to
the
states
i
recommend
that
this
appropriation
be
made
distributable
to
the
different
departments
upon
recommendation
of
a
committee
of
the
cabinet
and
approval
by
the
president
its
application
to
works
already
authorized
by
the
congress
assures
its
use
in
directions
of
economic
importance
and
to
public
welfare
such
action
will
imply
an
expenditure
upon
construction
of
all
kinds
of
over
during
the
next
twelve
months
agriculture
the
worldwide
depression
has
affected
agriculture
in
common
with
all
other
industries
the
average
price
of
farm
produce
has
fallen
to
about
per
cent
of
the
levels
of
this
average
is
however
greatly
affected
by
wheat
and
cotton
which
have
participated
in
worldwide
overproduction
and
have
fallen
to
about
per
cent
of
the
average
price
of
the
year
excluding
these
commodities
the
prices
of
all
other
agricultural
products
are
about
per
cent
of
those
of
the
average
wholesale
prices
of
other
primary
goods
such
as
nonferrous
metals
have
fallen
to
per
cent
of
the
price
levels
of
our
major
agricultural
commodities
are
in
fact
higher
than
those
in
other
principal
producing
countries
due
to
the
combined
result
of
the
tariff
and
the
operations
of
the
farm
board
for
instance
wheat
prices
at
minneapolis

aside
from
the
misfortune
to
agriculture
of
the
worldwide
depression
we
have
had
the
most
severe
drought
it
has
affected
particularly
the
states
bordering
on
the
potomac
ohio
and
lower
mississippi
rivers
with
some
areas
in
montana
kansas
oklahoma
and
texas
it
has
found
its
major
expression
in
the
shortage
of
pasturage
and
a
shrinkage
in
the
corn
crop
from
an
average
of
about
bushels
to
about
bushels
on
august
i
called
a
conference
of
the
governors
of
the
most
acutely
affected
states
and
as
a
result
of
its
conclusions
i
appointed
a
national
committee
comprising
the
heads
of
the
important
federal
agencies
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
the
governors
in
turn
have
appointed
state
committees
representative
of
the
farmers
bankers
business
men
and
the
red
cross
and
subsidiary
committees
have
been
established
in
most
of
the
acutely
affected
counties
railway
rates
were
reduced
on
feed
and
livestock
in
and
out
of
the
drought
areas
and
over
cars
of
such
products
have
been
transported
under
these
reduced
rates
the
red
cross
established
a
preliminary
fund
of
for
distress
relief
purposes
and
established
agencies
for
its
administration
in
each
county
of
this
fund
less
than
has
been
called
for
up
to
this
time
as
the
need
will
appear
more
largely
during
the
winter
the
federal
farm
loan
board
has
extended
its
credit
facilities
and
the
federal
farm
board
has
given
financial
assistance
to
all
affected
cooperatives
in
order
that
the
government
may
meet
its
full
obligation
toward
our
countrymen
in
distress
through
no
fault
of
their
own
i
recommend
that
an
appropriation
should
be
made
to
the
department
of
agriculture
to
be
loaned
for
the
purpose
of
seed
and
feed
for
animals
its
application
should
as
hitherto
in
such
loans
be
limited
to
a
gross
amount
to
any
one
individual
and
secured
upon
the
crop
the
red
cross
can
relieve
the
cases
of
individual
distress
by
the
sympathetic
assistance
of
our
people
finances
of
the
government
i
shall
submit
the
detailed
financial
position
of
the
government
with
recommendations
in
the
usual
budget
message
i
will
at
this
time
however
mention
that
the
budget
estimates
of
receipts
and
expenditures
for
the
current
year
were
formulated
by
the
treasury
and
the
budget
bureau
at
a
time
when
it
was
impossible
to
forecast
the
severity
of
the
business
depression
and
have
been
most
seriously
affected
by
it
at
that
time
a
surplus
of
about
was
estimated
for
this
fiscal
year
and
tax
reduction
which
affected
the
fiscal
year
to
the
extent
of
was
authorized
by
the
congress
thus
reducing
the
estimated
surplus
to
about
closely
revised
estimates
now
made
by
the
treasury
and
the
bureau
of
the
budget
of
the
tax
postal
and
other
receipts
for
the
current
fiscal
year
indicate
a
decrease
of
about
from
the
estimate
of
a
year
ago
of
which
about
is
due
to
tax
reduction
leaving
about
due
to
the
depression
moreover
legislation
enacted
by
congress
subsequent
to
the
submission
of
the
budget
enlarging
federal
construction
work
to
expand
employment
and
for
increase
in
veterans
services
and
other
items
have
increased
expenditures
during
the
current
fiscal
year
by
about
thus
the
decrease
of
in
revenue
and
the
increase
of
in
expenditure
adversely
change
the
original
budget
situation
by
about
this
large
sum
is
offset
by
the
original
estimated
surplus
a
year
ago
of
about
by
the
application
of
of
interest
payments
upon
the
foreign
debt
to
current
expenditures
by
arrangements
of
the
farm
board
through
repayments
etc
in
consequence
of
which
they
reduced
their
net
cash
demands
upon
the
treasury
by
in
this
period
and
by
about
economies
and
deferments
brought
about
in
the
government
thus
reducing
the
practical
effect
of
the
change
in
the
situation
to
an
estimated
deficit
of
about
for
the
present
fiscal
year
i
shall
make
suggestions
for
handling
the
presentyear
deficit
in
the
budget
message
but
i
do
not
favor
encroachment
upon
the
statutory
reduction
of
the
public
debt
while
it
will
be
necessary
in
public
interest
to
further
increase
expenditures
during
the
current
fiscal
year
in
aid
to
unemployment
by
speeding
up
construction
work
and
aid
to
the
farmers
affected
by
the
drought
i
can
not
emphasize
too
strongly
the
absolute
necessity
to
defer
any
other
plans
for
increase
of
government
expenditures
the
budget
for
fiscal
year
indicates
estimated
expenditure
of
about
including
postal
deficit
the
receipts
are
estimated
at
about
if
the
temporary
tax
reduction
of
last
year
be
discontinued
leaving
a
surplus
of
only
about
most
rigid
economy
is
therefore
necessary
to
avoid
increase
in
taxes
national

our
army
and
navy
are
being
maintained
at
a
high
state
of

under
officers
of
high

supported
by
a
devoted
personnel
of
the
rank
and
file
the
london
naval
treaty
has
brought
important
economies
in
the
conduct
of
the
navy
the
navy
department
will
lay
before
the
committees
of
the
congress
recommendations
for
a
program
of
authorization
of
new
construction
which
should
be
initiated
in
the
fiscal
year
of
legislation
this
is
the
last
session
of
the
seventyfirst
congress
during
its
previous
sittings
it
has
completed
a
very
large
amount
of
important
legislation
notably
the
establishment
of
the
federal
farm
board
fixing
congressional
reapportionment
revision
of
the
tariff
including
the
flexible
provisions
and
a

and
the

of
the

the

has
before
it
legislation
partially
completed
in
the
last
sitting
in
respect
to
muscle

bus

relief

in
the
courts
reorganization
of
border
patrol
in
prevention
of
smuggling
law
enforcement
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
other
subjects
it
is
desirable
that
these
measures
should
be
completed
the
short
session
does
not
permit
of
extensive

legislative
programs
but
there
are
a
number
of
questions
which
if
time
does
not
permit
action
i
recommend
should
be
placed
in
consideration
by
the
congress
perhaps
through
committees
cooperating
in
some
instances
with
the
federal
departments
with
view
to
preparation
for
subsequent
action
among
them
are
the
following
subjects
electrical
power
i
have
in
a
previous
message
recommended
effective
regulation
of
interstate
electrical
power
such
regulation
should
preserve
the
independence
and
responsibility
of
the
states
railways
we
have
determined
upon
a
national
policy
of
consolidation
of
the
railways
as
a
necessity
of
more
stable
and
more
economically
operated
transportation
further
legislation
is
necessary
to
facilitate
such
consolidation
in
the
public
interest
we
should
strengthen
the
railways
that
they
may
meet
our
future
needs
antitrust
laws
i
recommend
that
the
congress
institute
an
inquiry
into
some
aspects
of
the
economic
working
of
these
laws
i
do
not
favor
repeal
of
the
sherman
act
the
prevention
of
monopolies
is
of
most
vital
public
importance
competition
is
not
only
the
basis
of
protection
to
the
consumer
but
is
the
incentive
to
progress
however
the
interpretation
of
these
laws
by
the
courts
the
changes
in
business
especially
in
the
economic
effects
upon
those
enterprises
closely
related
to
the
use
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
make
such
an
inquiry
advisable
the
producers
of
these
materials
assert
that
certain
unfortunate
results
of
wasteful
and
destructive
use
of
these
natural
resources
together
with
a
destructive
competition
which
impoverishes
both
operator
and
worker
can
not
be
remedied
because
of
the
prohibitive
interpretation
of
the
antitrust
laws
the
wellknown
condition
of
the
bituminous
coal
industry
is
an
illustration
the
people
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
conservation
of
their
natural
resources
in
the
prevention
of
wasteful
practices
in
conditions
of
destructive
competition
which
may
impoverish
the
producer
and
the
wage
earner
and
they
have
an
equal
interest
in
maintaining
adequate
competition
i
therefore
suggest
that
an
inquiry
be
directed
especially
to
the
effect
of
the
workings
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
these
particular
fields
to
determine
if
these
evils
can
be
remedied
without
sacrifice
of
the
fundamental
purpose
of
these
laws
capitalgains
tax
it
is
urged
by
many
thoughtful
citizens
that
the
peculiar
economic
effect
of
the
income
tax
on
socalled
capital
gains
at
the
present
rate
is
to
enhance
speculative
inflation
and
likewise
impede
business
recovery
i
believe
this
to
be
the
case
and
i
recommend
that
a
study
be
made
of
the
economic
effects
of
this
tax
and
of
its
relation
to
the
general
structure
of
our
income
tax
law
immigration
there
is
need
for
revision
of
our
immigration
laws
upon
a
more
limited
and
more
selective
basis
flexible
to
the
needs
of
the
country
under
conditions
of
current
unemployment
it
is
obvious
that
persons
coming
to
the
united
states
seeking
work
would
likely
become
either
a
direct
or
indirect
public
charge
as
a
temporary
measure
the
officers
issuing
visas
to
immigrants
have
been
in
pursuance
of
the
law
instructed
to
refuse
visas
to
applicants
likely
to
fall
into
this
class
as
a
result
the
visas
issued
have
decreased
from
an
average
of
about
per
month
prior
to
restrictions
to
a
rate
of
about
during
the
last
month
these
are
largely
preferred
persons
under
the
law
visas
from
mexico
are
about
per
month
compared
to
about
previous
to
restrictions
the
whole
subject
requires
exhaustive
reconsideration
deportation
of
alien
criminals
i
urge
the
strengthening
of
our
deportation
laws
so
as
to
more
fully
rid
ourselves
of
criminal
aliens
furthermore
thousands
of
persons
have
entered
the
country
in
violation
of
the
immigration
laws
the
very
method
of
their
entry
indicates
their
objectionable
character
and
our
lawabiding
foreignborn
residents
suffer
in
consequence
i
recommend
that
the
congress
provide
methods
of
strengthening
the
government
to
correct
this
abuse
post
office
due
to
deferment
of
government
building
over
many
years
previous
administrations
had
been
compelled
to
enter
upon
types
of
leases
for
secondary
facilities
in
large
cities
some
of
which
were
objectionable
as
representing
too
high
a
return
upon
the
value
of
the
property
to
prevent
the
occasion
for
further
uneconomic
leasing
i
recommend
that
the
congress
authorize
the
building
by
the
government
of
its
own
facilities
veterans
the
nation
has
generously
expanded
its
care
for
veterans
the
consolidation
of
all
veterans
activities
into
the
veterans
administration
has
produced
substantial
administrative
economies
the
consolidation
also
brings
emphasis
to
the
inequalities
in
service
and
allowances
the
whole
subject
is
under
study
by
the
administrator
and
i
recommend
it
should
also
be
examined
by
the
committees
of
the
congress
social
service
i
urge
further
consideration
by
the
congress
of
the
recommendations
i
made
a
year
ago
looking
to
the
development
through
temporary
federal
aid
of
adequate
state
and
local
services
for
the
health
of
children
and
the
further
stamping
out
of
communicable
disease
particularly
in
the
rural
sections
the
advance
of
scientific
discovery
methods
and
social
thought
imposes
a
new
vision
in
these
matters
the
drain
upon
the
federal
treasury
is
comparatively
small
the
results
both
economic
and
moral
are
of
the
utmost
importance
general
it
is
my
belief
that
after
the
passing
of
this
depression
when
we
can
examine
it
in
retrospect
we
shall
need
to
consider
a
number
of
other
questions
as
to
what
action
may
be
taken
by
the
government
to
remove
possible
governmental
influences
which
make
for
instability
and
to
better
organize
mitigation
of
the
effect
of
depression
it
is
as
yet
too
soon
to
constructively
formulate
such
measures
there
are
many
administrative
subjects
such
as
departmental
reorganization
extension
of
the
civil
service
readjustment
of
the
postal
rates
etc
which
at
some
appropriate
time
require
the
attention
of
the
congress
foreign
relations
our
relations
with
foreign
countries
have
been
maintained
upon
a
high
basis
of
cordiality
and
good
will
during
the
past
year
the
london
naval
pact
was
completed
approved
by
the
senate
and
ratified
by
the
governments
concerned
by
this
treaty
we
have
abolished
competition
in
the
building
of
warships
have
established
the
basis
of
parity
of
the
united
states
with
the
strongest
of
foreign
powers
and
have
accomplished
a
substantial
reduction
in
war
vessels
during
the
year
there
has
been
an
extended
political
unrest
in
the
world
asia
continues
in
disturbed
condition
and
revolutions
have
taken
place
in
brazil
argentina
peru
and
bolivia
despite
the
jeopardy
to
our
citizens
and
their
property
which
naturally
arises
in
such
circumstances
we
have
with
the
cooperation
of
the
governments
concerned
been
able
to
meet
all
such
instances
without
friction
we
have
resumed
normal
relations
with
the
new
governments
of
brazil
argentina
peru
and
bolivia
immediately
upon
evidence
that
they
were
able
to
give
protection
to
our
citizens
and
their
property
and
that
they
recognized
their
international
obligations
a
commission
which
was
supported
by
the
congress
has
completed
its
investigation
and
reported
upon
our
future
policies
in
respect
to
haiti
and
proved
of
high
value
in
securing
the
acceptance
of
these
policies
an
election
has
been
held
and
a
new
government
established
we
have
replaced
our
high
commissioner
by
a
minister
and
have
begun
the
gradual
withdrawal
of
our
activities
with
view
to
complete
retirement
at
the
expiration
of
the
present
treaty
in
a
number
of
arbitration
and
conciliation
treaties
have
been
completed
or
negotiated
during
the
year
and
will
be
presented
for
approval
by
the
senate
i
shall
in
a
special
message
lay
before
the
senate
the
protocols
covering
the
statutes
of
the
world
court
which
have
been
revised
to
accord
with
the
sense
of
previous
senate
reservations
the
white
house
december

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
constitution
requires
that
the
president
shall
from
time
to
time
give
to
the
congress
information
of
the
state
of
the
union
and
recommend
to
their
consideration
such
measures
as
he
shall
judge
necessary
and
expedient
in
complying
with
that
requirement
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
during
the
past
year
the
nation
has
continued
to
grow
in
strength
our
people
have
advanced
in
comfort
we
have
gained
in
knowledge
the
education
of
youth
has
been
more
widely
spread
moral
and
spiritual
forces
have
been
maintained
peace
has
become
more
assured
the
problems
with
which
we
are
confronted
are
the
problems
of
growth
and
of
progress
in
their
solution
we
have
to
determine
the
facts
to
develop
the
relative
importance
to
be
assigned
to
such
facts
to
formulate
a
common
judgment
upon
them
and
to
realize
solutions
in
spirit
of
conciliation
foreign
relations
we
are
not
only
at
peace
with
all
the
world
but
the
foundations
for
future
peace
are
being
substantially
strengthened
to
promote
peace
is
our
longestablished
policy
through
the
kelloggbriand
pact
a
great
moral
standard
has
been
raised
in
the
world
by
it
fiftyfour
nations
have
covenanted
to
renounce
war
and
to
settle
all
disputes
by
pacific
means
through
it
a
new
world
outlook
has
been
inaugurated
which
has
profoundly
affected
the
foreign
policies
of
nations
since
its
inauguration
we
have
initiated
new
efforts
not
only
in
the
organization
of
the
machinery
of
peace
but
also
to
eliminate
dangerous
forces
which
produce
controversies
amongst
nations
in
january
the
senate
gave
its
consent
to
adherence
to
the
court
of
international
justice
with
certain
reservations
in
september
of
this
year
the
statute
establishing
the
court
has
by
the
action
of
the
nations
signatory
been
amended
to
meet
the
senates
reservations
and
to
go
even
beyond
those
reservations
to
make
clear
that
the
court
is
a
true
international
court
of
justice
i
believe
it
will
be
clear
to
everyone
that
no
controversy
or
question
in
which
this
country
has
or
claims
an
interest
can
be
passed
on
by
the
court
without
our
consent
at
the
time
the
question
arises
the
doubt
about
advisory
opinions
has
been
completely
safeguarded
our
adherence
to
the
international
court
is
as
now
constituted
not
the
slightest
step
toward
entry
into
the
league
of
nations
as
i
have
before
indicated
i
shall
direct
that
our
signature
be
affixed
to
the
protocol
of
adherence
and
shall
submit
it
for
the
approval
of
the
senate
with
a
special
message
at
some
time
when
it
is
convenient
to
deal
with
it
in
the
hope
of
reducing
friction
in
the
world
and
with
the
desire
that
we
may
reduce
the
great
economic
burdens
of
naval
armament
we
have
joined
in
conference
with
great
britain
france
italy
and
japan
to
be
held
in
london
in
january
to
consider
the
further
limitation
and
reduction
of
naval
arms
we
hold
high
hopes
that
success
may
attend
this
effort
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
administration
the
neighboring
state
of
mexico
was
best
with
domestic
insurrection
we
maintained
the
embargo
upon
the
shipment
of
arms
to
mexico
but
permitted
the
duly
constituted
government
to
procure
supplies
from
our
surplus
war
stocks
fortunately
the
mexican
government
by
its
own
strength
successfully
withstood
the
insurrection
with
but
slight
damage
opportunity
of
further
peaceful
development
is
given
to
that
country
at
the
request
of
the
mexican
government
we
have
since
lifted
the
embargo
on
shipment
of
arms
altogether
the
two
governments
have
taken
further
steps
to
promote
friendly
relationships
and
so
solve
our
differences
conventions
prolonging
for
a
period
of
two
years
the
life
of
the
general
and
special
claims
commissions
have
been
concluded
in
south
america
we
are
proud
to
have
had
part
in
the
settlement
of
the
longstanding
dispute
between
chile
and
peru
in
the
disposal
of
the
question
of
tacnaarica
the
work
of
the
commission
of
inquiry
and
conciliation
between
bolivia
and
paraguay
in
which
a
representative
of
this
government
participated
has
successfully
terminated
an
incident
which
seemed
to
threaten
war
the
proposed
plan
for
final
settlement
as
suggested
by
the
neutral
governments
is
still
under
consideration
this
government
has
continued
its
efforts
to
act
as
a
mediator
in
boundary
difficulties
between
guatemala
and
honduras
a
further
instance
of
profound
importance
in
establishing
good
will
was
the
inauguration
of
regular
air
mail
service
between
the
united
states
and
caribbean
central
american
and
south
american
countries
we
still
have
marines
on
foreign
soilin
nicaragua
haiti
and
china
in
the
large
sense
we
do
not
wish
to
be
represented
abroad
in
such
manner
about
marines
remain
in
nicaragua
at
the
urgent
request
of
that
government
and
the
leaders
of
all
parties
pending
the
training
of
a
domestic
constabulary
capable
of
insuring
tranquility
we
have
already
reduced
these
forces
materially
and
we
are
anxious
to
withdraw
them
further
as
the
situation
warrants
in
haiti
we
have
about
marines
but
it
is
a
much
more
difficult
problem
the
solution
of
which
is
still
obscure
if
congress
approves
i
shall
dispatch
a
commission
to
haiti
to
review
and
study
the
matter
in
an
endeavor
to
arrive
at
some
more
definite
policy
than
at
present
our
forces
in
china
constitute
men
which
we
hope
also
further
to
reduce
to
the
normal
legation
guard
it
is
my
desire
to
establish
more
firmly
our
understanding
and
relationships
with
the
latin
american
countries
by
strengthening
the
diplomatic
missions
to
those
countries
it
is
my
hope
to
secure
men
long
experienced
in
our
diplomatic
service
who
speak
the
languages
of
the
peoples
to
whom
they
are
accredited
as
chiefs
of
our
diplomatic
missions
in
these
states
i
shall
send
to
the
senate
at
an
early
date
the
nominations
of
several
such
men
the
congress
has
by
numerous
wise
and
foresighted
acts
in
the
past
few
years
greatly
strengthened
the
character
of
our
representation
abroad
it
has
made
liberal
provision
for
the
establishment
of
suitable
quarters
for
our
foreign
staffs
in
the
different
countries
in
order
however
that
we
may
further
develop
the
most
effective
force
in
this
one
of
the
most
responsible
functions
of
our
government
i
shall
recommend
to
the
congress
more
liberal
appropriations
for
the
work
of
the
state
department
i
know
of
no
expenditure
of
public
money
from
which
a
greater
economic
and
moral
return
can
come
to
us
than
by
assuring
the
most
effective
conduct
of
our
foreign
relations
national
defense
to
preserve
internal
order
and
freedom
from
encroachment
is
the
first
purpose
of
government
our
army
and
navy
are
being
maintained
in
a
most
efficient
state
under
officers
of
high
intelligence
and
zeal
the
extent
and
expansion
of
their
numbers
and
equipment
as
at
present
authorized
are
ample
for
this
purpose
we
can
well
be
deeply
concerned
however
at
the
growing
expense
from
a
total
expenditure
for
national
defense
purposes
in
of
it
naturally
rose
with
the
great
war
but
receded
again
to
in
when
again
it
began
to
rise
until
during
the
current
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
will
reach
to
over
excluding
all
civilian
services
of
those
departments
programs
now
authorized
will
carry
it
to
still
larger
figures
in
future
years
while
the
remuneration
paid
to
our
soldiers
and
sailors
is
justly
at
a
higher
rate
than
that
of
any
other
country
in
the
world
and
while
the
cost
of
subsistence
is
higher
yet
the
total
of
our
expenditures
is
in
excess
of
those
of
the
most
highly
militarized
nations
of
the
world
upon
the
conference
shortly
to
be
held
in
london
will
depend
such
moderation
as
we
can
make
in
naval
expenditure
if
we
shall
be
compelled
to
undertake
the
naval
construction
implied
in
the
washington
arms
treaty
as
well
as
other
construction
which
would
appear
to
be
necessary
if
no
international
agreement
can
be
completed
we
shall
be
committed
during
the
next
six
years
to
a
construction
expenditure
of
upward
of
besides
the
necessary
further
increase
in
costs
for
annual
upkeep
after
the
various
army
contingents
necessarily
expanded
to
the
end
of
the
great
war
and
then
receded
to
the
low
point
in
when
expansion
again
began
in
the
officers
and
men
in
our
regular
forces
both
army
and
navy
were
about
in
there
were
about
and
in
there
were
about
our
citizens
army
however
including
the
national
guard
and
other
forms
of
reserves
increase
these
totals
up
to
about
in
about
in
and
about
in
under
the
kellogg
pact
we
have
undertaken
never
to
use
war
as
an
instrument
of
national
policy
we
have
therefore
undertaken
by
covenant
to
use
these
equipments
solely
for
defensive
purposes
from
a
defense
point
of
view
our
forces
should
be
proportioned
to
national
need
and
should
therefore
to
some
extent
be
modified
by
the
prospects
of
peace
which
were
never
brighter
than
today
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
improvement
in
the
national
guard
by
federal
support
begun
in
has
definitely
strengthened
our
national
security
by
rendering
them
far
more
effective
than
ever
heretofore
the
advance
of
aviation
has
also
greatly
increased
our
effectiveness
in
defense
in
addition
to
the
very
large
program
of
air
forces
which
we
are
maintaining
in
the
army
and
navy
there
has
been
an
enormous
growth
of
commercial
aviation
this
has
provided
unanticipated
reserves
in
manufacturing
capacity
and
in
industrial
and
air
personnel
which
again
adds
to
our
security
i
recommend
that
congress
give
earnest
consideration
to
the
possibilities
of
prudent
action
which
will
give
relief
from
our
continuously
mounting
expenditures
finances
of
the
government
the
finances
of
the
government
are
in
sound
condition
i
shall
submit
the
detailed
evidences
and
the
usual
recommendations
in
the
special
budget
message
i
may
however
summarize
our
position
the
public
debt
on
june
this
year
stood
at
compared
to
the
maximum
in
august
of
since
june
it
has
been
reduced
by
a
further
in
the
budget
to
be
submitted
the
total
appropriations
recommended
for
the
fiscal
year
are
as
compared
to
for
the
present
fiscal
year
the
present
fiscal
year
however
includes
for
the
federal
farm
board
as
to
whic
h
no
estimate
can
as
yet
be
determined
for
owing
to
the
many
necessary
burdens
assumed
by
congress
in
previous
years
which
now
require
large
outlays
it
is
with
extreme
difficulty
that
we
shall
be
able
to
keep
the
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
within
the
bounds
of
the
present
year
economies
in
many
directions
have
permitted
some
accommodation
of
pressing
needs
the
net
result
being
an
increase
as
shown
above
of
about
onetenth
of
per
cent
above
the
present
fiscal
year
we
can
not
fail
to
recognize
the
obligations
of
the
government
in
support
of
the
public
welfare
but
we
must
coincidentally
bear
in
mind
the
burden
of
taxes
and
strive
to
find
relief
through
some
tax
reduction
every
dollar
so
returned
fertilizes
the
soil
of
prosperity
tax
reduction
the
estimate
submitted
to
me
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
budget
director
indicates
that
the
government
will
close
the
fiscal
year
with
a
surplus
of
about
and
the
fiscal
year
with
a
surplus
of
about
owing
to
unusual
circumstances
it
has
been
extremely
difficult
to
estimate
future
revenues
with
accuracy
i
believe
however
that
the
congress
will
be
fully
justified
in
giving
the
benefits
of
the
prospective
surpluses
to
the
taxpayers
particularly
as
ample
provision
for
debt
reduction
has
been
made
in
both
years
through
the
form
of
debt
retirement
from
ordinary
revenues
in
view
of
the
uncertainty
in
respect
of
future
revenues
and
the
comparatively
small
size
of
the
indicated
surplus
in
relief
should
take
the
form
of
a
provisional
revision
of
tax
rates
i
recommend
that
the
normal
income
tax
rates
applicable
to
the
incomes
of
individuals
for
the
calendar
year
be
reduced
from
and
per
cent
to
and
per
cent
and
that
the
tax
on
the
income
of
corporations
for
the
calendar
year
be
reduced
from
to
per
cent
it
is
estimated
that
this
will
result
in
a
reduction
of
in
income
taxes
to
be
collected
during
the
calendar
year
the
loss
in
revenue
will
be
divided
approximately
equally
between
the
fiscal
years
and
such
a
program
will
give
a
measure
of
tax
relief
to
the
maximum
number
of
taxpayers
with
relatively
larger
benefits
to
taxpayers
with
small
or
moderate
incomes
foreign
debts
the
past
year
has
brought
us
near
to
completion
of
settlements
of
the
indebtedness
of
foreign
governments
to
the
united
states
the
act
of
congress
approved
february
authorized
the
settlement
with
the
government
of
austria
along
lines
similar
to
the
terms
of
settlement
offered
by
that
government
to
its
other
relief
creditors
no
agreement
has
yet
been
concluded
with
that
government
but
the
form
of
agreement
has
been
settled
and
its
execution
only
awaits
the
government
of
austria
securing
the
assent
by
all
the
other
relief
creditors
of
the
terms
offered
the
act
of
congress
approved
february
authorized
the
settlement
with
the
government
of
greece
and
an
agreement
was
concluded
on
may
the
government
of
france
ratified
the
agreement
with
us
on
july
this
agreement
will
shortly
be
before
the
congress
and
i
recommend
its
approval
the
only
indebtedness
of
foreign
governments
to
the
united
states
now
unsettled
is
that
of
russia
and
armenia
during
the
past
year
a
committee
of
distinguished
experts
under
american
leadership
submitted
a
plan
looking
to
a
revision
of
claims
against
germany
by
the
various
governments
the
united
states
denied
itself
any
participation
in
the
war
settlement
of
general
reparations
and
our
claims
are
comparatively
small
in
amount
they
arise
from
costs
of
the
army
of
occupation
and
claims
of
our
private
citizens
for
losses
under
awards
from
the
mixed
claims
commission
established
under
agreement
with
the
german
government
in
finding
a
basis
for
settlement
it
was
necessary
for
the
committee
of
experts
to
request
all
the
governments
concerned
to
make
some
contribution
to
the
adjustment
and
we
have
felt
that
we
should
share
a
proportion
of
the
concessions
made
the
state
and
treasury
departments
will
be
in
a
position
shortly
to
submit
for
your
consideration
a
draft
of
an
agreement
to
be
executed
between
the
united
states
and
germany
providing
for
the
payments
of
these
revised
amounts
a
more
extensive
statement
will
be
submitted
at
that
time
the
total
amount
of
indebtedness
of
the
various
countries
to
the
united
states
now
funded
is
this
sum
was
in
effect
provided
by
the
issue
of
united
states
government
bonds
to
our
own
people
the
payments
of
the
various
governments
to
us
on
account
of
principal
and
interest
for
are
estimated
at
a
total
of
about
for
at
about
for
at
about
the
measure
of
american
compromise
in
these
settlements
may
be
appreciated
from
the
fact
that
our
taxpayers
are
called
upon
to
find
annually
about
in
interest
and
in
addition
to
redeem
the
principal
of
sums
borrowed
by
the
united
states
government
for
these
purposes
alien
enemy
property
the
wise
determination
that
this
property
seized
in
war
should
be
returned
to
its
owners
has
proceeded
with
considerable
rapidity
of
the
original
seized
cash
and
property
valued
at
a
total
of
about
all
but
has
been
returned
most
of
the
remainder
should
be
disposed
of
during
the
next
year
general
economic
situation
the
country
has
enjoyed
a
large
degree
of
prosperity
and
sound
progress
during
the
past
year
with
a
steady
improvement
in
methods
of
production
and
distribution
and
consequent
advancement
in
standards
of
living
progress
has
of
course
been
unequal
among
industries
and
some
such
as
coal
lumber
leather
and
textiles
still
lag
behind
the
long
upward
trend
of
fundamental
progress
however
gave
rise
to
overoptimism
as
to
profits
which
translated
itself
into
a
wave
of
uncontrolled
speculation
in
securities
resulting
in
the
diversion
of
capital
from
business
to
the
stock
market
and
the
inevitable
crash
the
natural
consequences
have
been
a
reduction
in
the
consumption
of
luxuries
and
seminecessities
by
those
who
have
met
with
losses
and
a
number
of
persons
thrown
temporarily
out
of
employment
prices
of
agricultural
products
dealt
in
upon
the
great
markets
have
been
affected
in
sympathy
with
the
stock
crash
fortunately
the
federal
reserve
system
had
taken
measures
to
strengthen
the
position
against
the
day
when
speculation
would
break
which
together
with
the
strong
position
of
the
banks
has
carried
the
whole
credit
system
through
the
crisis
without
impairment
the
capital
which
has
been
hitherto
absorbed
in
stockmarket
loans
for
speculative
purposes
is
now
returning
to
the
normal
channels
of
business
there
has
been
no
inflation
in
the
prices
of
commodities
there
has
been
no
undue
accumulation
of
goods
and
foreign
trade
has
expanded
to
a
magnitude
which
exerts
a
steadying
influence
upon
activity
in
industry
and
employment
the
sudden
threat
of
unemployment
and
especially
the
recollection
of
the
economic
consequences
of
previous
crashes
under
a
much
less
secured
financial
system
created
unwarranted
pessimism
and
fear
it
was
recalled
that
past
storms
of
similar
character
had
resulted
in
retrenchment
of
construction
reduction
of
wages
and
laying
off
of
workers
the
natural
result
was
the
tendency
of
business
agencies
throughout
the
country
to
pause
in
their
plans
and
proposals
for
continuation
and
extension
of
their
businesses
and
this
hesitation
unchecked
could
in
itself
intensify
into
a
depression
with
widespread
unemployment
and
suffering
i
have
therefore
instituted
systematic
voluntary
measures
of
cooperation
with
the
business
institutions
and
with
state
and
municipal
authorities
to
make
certain
that
fundamental
businesses
of
the
country
shall
continue
as
usual
that
wages
and
therefore
consuming
power
shall
not
be
reduced
and
that
a
special
effort
shall
be
made
to
expand
construction
work
in
order
to
assist
in
equalizing
other
deficits
in
employment
due
to
the
enlarged
sense
of
cooperation
and
responsibility
which
has
grown
in
the
business
world
during
the
past
few
years
the
response
has
been
remarkable
and
satisfactory
we
have
canvassed
the
federal
government
and
instituted
measures
of
prudent
expansion
in
such
work
that
should
be
helpful
and
upon
which
the
different
departments
will
make
some
early
recommendations
to
congress
i
am
convinced
that
through
these
measures
we
have
reestablished
confidence
wages
should
remain
stable
a
very
large
degree
of
industrial
unemployment
and
suffering
which
would
otherwise
have
occurred
has
been
prevented
agricultural
prices
have
reflected
the
returning
confidence
the
measures
taken
must
be
vigorously
pursued
until
normal
conditions
are
restored
agriculture
the
agricultural
situation
is
improving
the
gross
farm
income
as
estimated
by
the
department
of
agriculture
for
the
crop
season
was
for
it
was
for
it
was
and
estimated
on
the
basis
of
prices
since
the
last
harvest
the
value
of
the
crop
would
be
over
the
slight
decline
in
general
commodity
prices
during
the
past
few
years
naturally
assists
the
farmers
buying
power
the
number
of
farmer
bankruptcies
is
very
materially
decreased
below
previous
years
the
decline
in
land
values
now
seems
to
be
arrested
and
rate
of
movement
from
the
farm
to
the
city
has
been
reduced
not
all
sections
of
agriculture
of
course
have
fared
equally
and
some
areas
have
suffered
from
drought
responsible
farm
leaders
have
assured
me
that
a
large
measure
of
confidence
is
returning
to
agriculture
and
that
a
feeling
of
optimism
pervades
that
industry
the
most
extensive
action
for
strengthening
the
agricultural
industry
ever
taken
by
any
government
was
inaugurated
through
the
farm
marketing
act
of
june
last
under
its
provisions
the
federal
farm
board
has
been
established
comprised
of
men
long
and
widely
experienced
in
agriculture
and
sponsored
by
the
farm
organizations
of
the
country
during
its
short
period
of
existence
the
board
has
taken
definite
steps
toward
a
more
efficient
organization
of
agriculture
toward
the
elimination
of
waste
in
marketing
and
toward
the
upbuilding
of
farmers
marketing
organizations
on
sounder
and
more
efficient
lines
substantial
headway
has
been
made
in
the
organization
of
four
of
the
basic
commoditiesgrain
cotton
livestock
and
wool
support
by
the
board
to
cooperat
ive
marketing
organizations
and
other
board
activities
undoubtedly
have
served
to
steady
the
farmers
market
during
the
recent
crisis
and
have
operated
also
as
a
great
stimulus
to
the
cooperative
organization
of
agriculture
the
problems
of
the
industry
are
most
complex
and
the
need
for
sound
organization
is
imperative
yet
the
board
is
moving
rapidly
along
the
lines
laid
out
for
it
in
the
act
facilitating
the
creation
by
farmers
of
farmerowned
and
farmercontrolled
organizations
and
federating
them
into
central
institutions
with
a
view
to
increasing
the
bargaining
power
of
agriculture
preventing
and
controlling
surpluses
and
mobilizing
the
economic
power
of
agriculture
the
tariff
the
special
session
of
congress
was
called
to
expedite
the
fulfillment
of
party
pledges
of
agricultural
relief
and
the
tariff
the
pledge
of
farm
relief
has
been
carried
out
at
that
time
i
stated
the
principles
upon
which
i
believed
action
should
be
taken
in
respect
to
the
tariff
an
effective
tariff
upon
agricultural
products
that
will
compensate
the
farmers
higher
costs
and
higher
standards
of
living
has
a
dual
purpose
such
a
tariff
not
only
protects
the
farmer
in
our
domestic
market
but
it
also
stimulates
him
to
diversify
his
crops
and
to
grow
products
that
he
could
not
otherwise
produce
and
thus
lessens
his
dependence
upon
exports
to
foreign
markets
the
great
expansion
of
production
abroad
under
the
conditions
i
have
mentioned
renders
foreign
competition
in
our
export
markets
increasingly
serious
it
seems
but
natural
therefore
that
the
american
farmer
having
been
greatly
handicapped
in
his
foreign
market
by
such
competition
from
the
younger
expanding
countries
should
ask
that
foreign
access
to
our
domestic
market
should
be
regulated
by
taking
into
account
the
differences
in
our
costs
of
production
in
considering
the
tariff
for
other
industries
than
agriculture
we
find
that
there
have
been
economic
shifts
necessitating
a
readjustment
of
some
of
the
tariff
schedules
seven
years
of
experience
under
the
tariff
bill
enacted
in
have
demonstrated
the
wisdom
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
that
measure
on
the
whole
it
has
worked
well
in
the
main
our
wages
have
been
maintained
at
high
levels
our
exports
and
imports
have
steadily
increased
with
some
exceptions
our
manufacturing
industries
have
been
prosperous
nevertheless
economic
changes
have
taken
place
during
that
time
which
have
placed
certain
domestic
products
at
a
disadvantage
and
new
industries
have
come
into
being
all
of
which
create
the
necessity
for
some
limited
changes
in
the
schedules
and
in
the
administrative
clauses
of
the
laws
as
written
in
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
test
of
necessity
for
revision
is
in
the
main
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
slackening
of
activity
in
an
industry
during
the
past
few
years
and
a
consequent
decrease
of
employment
due
to
insurmountable
competition
in
the
products
of
that
industry
it
is
not
as
if
we
were
setting
up
a
new
basis
of
protective
duties
we
did
that
seven
years
ago
what
we
need
to
remedy
now
is
whatever
substantial
loss
of
employment
may
have
resulted
from
shifts
since
that
time
in
determining
changes
in
our
tariff
we
must
not
fail
to
take
into
account
the
broad
interests
of
the
country
as
a
whole
and
such
interests
include
our
trade
relations
with
other
countries
no
condition
has
arisen
in
my
view
to
change
these
principles
stated
at
the
opening
of
the
special
session
i
am
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
their
application
to
the
pending
revision
will
give
the
country
the
kind
of
a
tariff
law
it
both
needs
and
wants
it
would
be
most
helpful
if
action
should
be
taken
at
an
early
moment
more
especially
at
a
time
when
business
and
agriculture
are
both
cooperating
to
minimize
future
uncertainties
it
is
just
that
they
should
know
what
the
rates
are
to
be
even
a
limited
revision
requires
the
consideration
and
readjustment
of
many
items
the
exhaustive
inquiries
and
valuable
debate
from
men
representative
of
all
parts
of
the
country
which
is
needed
to
determine
the
detailed
rates
must
necessarily
be
accomplished
in
the
congress
however
perfectly
this
rate
structure
may
be
framed
at
any
given
time
the
shifting
of
economic
forces
which
inevitably
occurs
will
render
changes
in
some
items
desirable
between
the
necessarily
long
intervals
of
congressional
revision
injustices
are
bound
to
develop
such
as
were
experienced
by
the
dairymen
the
flaxseed
producers
the
glass
industry
and
others
under
the
rates
for
this
reason
i
have
been
most
anxious
that
the
broad
principle
of
the
flexible
tariff
as
provided
in
the
existing
law
should
be
preserved
and
its
delays
in
action
avoided
by
more
expeditious
methods
of
determining
the
costs
of
production
at
home
and
abroad
with
executive
authority
to
promulgate
such
changes
upon
recommendation
of
the
tariff
commission
after
exhaustive
investigation
changes
by
the
congress
in
the
isolated
items
such
as
those
to
which
i
have
referred
would
have
been
most
unlikely
both
because
of
the
concentrations
of
oppositions
in
the
country
who
could
see
no
advantage
to
their
own
industry
or
state
and
because
of
the
difficulty
of
limiting
consideration
by
the
congress
to
such
isolated
cases
there
is
no
fundamental
conflict
between
the
interests
of
the
farmer
and
the
worker
lowering
of
the
standards
of
living
of
either
tends
to
destroy
the
other
the
prosperity
of
one
rests
upon
the
wellbeing
of
the
other
nor
is
there
any
real
conflict
between
the
east
and
the
west
or
the
north
and
the
south
in
the
united
states
the
complete
interlocking
of
economic
dependence
the
common
striving
for
social
and
spiritual
progress
our
common
heritage
as
americans
and
the
infinite
web
of
national
sentiment
have
created
a
solidarity
in
a
great
people
unparalleled
in
all
human
history
these
invisible
bonds
should
not
and
can
not
be
shattered
by
differences
of
opinion
growing
out
of
discussion
of
a
tariff
public
buildings
under
the
provisions
of
various
acts
of
congress
has
been
authorized
for
public
buildings
and
the
land
upon
which
to
construct
them
being
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
for
the
country
at
large
excluding
which
is
for
the
acquisition
of
land
in
the
socalled
triangle
in
this
city
this
public
building
legislation
provides
for
a
fiveyear
program
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
between
an
eight
and
nine
year
program
for
the
country
at
large
of
this
sum
approximately
was
expended
up
to
june
last
of
which
has
been
expended
in
the
district
and
outside
even
this
generous
provision
for
both
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
country
is
insufficient
for
most
pressing
governmental
needs
expensive
rents
and
inadequate
facilities
are
extravagance
and
not
economy
in
the
district
even
after
the
completion
of
these
projects
we
shall
have
fully
clerks
housed
in
rented
and
temporary
war
buildings
which
can
last
but
a
little
longer
i
therefore
recommend
that
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
extension
of
authorizations
both
for
the
country
at
large
and
for
the
district
of
columbia
again
distributed
over
a
term
of
years
a
survey
of
the
need
in
both
categories
has
been
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
postmaster
general
it
would
be
helpful
in
the
present
economic
situation
if
such
steps
were
taken
as
would
enable
early
construction
work
an
expedition
and
enlargement
of
the
program
in
the
district
would
bring
about
direct
economies
in
construction
by
enabling
the
erection
of
buildings
in
regular
sequence
by
maintaining
a
stable
labor
force
in
the
city
contracts
can
be
made
on
more
advantageous
terms
the
earlier
completion
of
this
program
which
is
an
acknowledged
need
would
add
dignity
to
the
celebration
in
of
the
two
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
president
washington
in
consideration
of
these
projects
which
contribute
so
much
to
dignify
the
national
capital
i
should
like
to
renew
the
suggestion
that
the
fine
arts
commission
should
be
required
to
pass
upon
private
buildings
which
are
proposed
for
sites
facing
upon
public
buildings
and
parks
without
such
control
much
of
the
effort
of
the
congress
in
beautification
of
the
capital
will
be
minimized
the
waterways
and
flood
control
the
development
of
inland
waterways
has
received
new
impulse
from
the
completion
during
this
year
of
the
canalization
of
the
ohio
to
a
uniform
foot
depth
the
development
of
the
other
segments
of
the
mississippi
system
should
be
expedited
and
with
this
in
view
i
am
recommending
an
increase
in
appropriations
for
rivers
and
harbors
from
to
per
annum
which
together
with
about
per
annum
released
by
completion
of
the
ohio
should
make
available
after
providing
for
other
river
and
harbor
works
a
sum
of
from
to
per
annum
for
the
mississippi
system
and
thus
bring
it
to
early
completion
conflict
of
opinion
which
has
arisen
over
the
proposed
floodway
from
the
arkansas
river
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
via
the
atchafalaya
river
has
led
me
to
withhold
construction
upon
this
portion
of
the
mississippi
flood
control
plan
until
it
could
be
again
reviewed
by
the
engineers
for
any
further
recommendation
to
congress
the
other
portions
of
the
project
are
being
vigorously
prosecuted
and
i
have
recommended
an
increase
in
appropriations
for
this
from
of
the
present
year
to
during
the
next
fiscal
year
expansion
of
our
intracoastal
waterways
to
effective
barge
depths
is
well
warranted
we
are
awaiting
the
action
of
canada
upon
the
st

waterway
project
highways
there
are
over
miles
of
legally
established
highways
in
the
united
states
of
which
about
per
cent
are
included
in
the
state
highway
systems
the
remainder
being
county
and
other
local
roads
about
miles
have
been
improved
with
some
type
of

comprising
some
per
cent
of
the
state
highway
systems
and
per
cent
of
the
local

of
the
improved

about
miles
are
hard
surfaced
comprising
about
per
cent
of
the
state
highway
systems
and
about
per
cent
of
the
local
roads
while
proper
planning
should
materially
reduce
the
listed
mileage
of
public
roads
particularly
in
the
agricultural
districts
and
turn
these
roads
back
to
useful

purposes
it
is
evident
that
road
construction
must
be
a
longcontinued
program
progress
in
improvement
is
about
miles
of
all
types
per
annum
of
which
some
miles
are
of
the
more
durable
types
the
total
expenditures
of
federal
state
and
local
governments
last
year
for
construction
and
maintenance
assumed
the
huge
total
of
federal
aid
in
the
construction
of
the
highway
systems
in
conjunction
with
the
states
has
proved
to
be
beneficial
and
stimulating
we
must
ultimately
give
consideration
to
the
increase
of
our
contribution
to
these
systems
particularly
with
a
view
to
stimulating
the
improvement
of

post

our
post
office
deficit
has
now
increased
to
over
a
year
of
which
perhaps
is
due
to
losses
on
ocean
mail
and
air
mail
contracts
the
department
is
making
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
sources
of
the
deficit
with
view
to
later
recommendation
to
congress
in
respect
to
it
the
post
office
quarters
are
provided
in
part
by
the
federal
construction
in
part
by
various
forms
of
rent
and
lease
arrangements
the
practice
has
grown
up
in
recent
years
of
contracting
long
term
leases
under
which
both
rent
and
amortization
principal
cost
of
buildings
is
included
i
am
advised
that
fully
per
cent
could
be
saved
from
many
such
rent
and
lease
agreements
even
after
allowing
interest
on
the
capital
required
at
the
normal
government
rate
there
are
also
many
objectionable
features
to
some
of
these
practices
the
provision
of
adequate
quarters
for
the

should
be
put
on
a
sound
basis
a
revision
of
air
mail
rates
upon
a
more
systematic
and
permanent
footing
is
necessary
the
subject
is
under
study
and
if
legislation
should
prove
necessary
the
subject
will
be
presented
to
the
congress
in
the
meantime
i
recommend
that
the
congress
should
consider
the
desirability
of
authorizing
further

commercial

during
the

progress
in

this

of

the
objective
of

be
attained
legislation
to

methods

better

be
enacted

also
be
given

the
necessity

detailed
attention

comparatively
inconsequential
matters
which
under

receive

direct
and
personal
consideration
it
is
in

the

not
be

pressed
by
minor

that
they
have

committed
to

as
to
many
of
these
minor

the

might
well
be
made

originally
established
and
the
estimate
of
expenditures
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
is
based
upon
reduction
in
losses
on
government
lines
by
approximately
onehalf
construction
loans
have
been
made
to
the
amount
of
approximately
out
of
the
revolving
fund
authorized
by
congress
and
have
furnished
an
additional
aid
to
american
shipping
and
further
stimulated
the
building
of
vessels
in
american
yards
desirous
of
securing
the
full
values
to
the
nation
of
the
great
effort
to
develop
our
merchant
marine
by
the
merchant
marine
act
soon
after
the
inauguration
of
the
present
administration
i
appointed
an
interdepartmental
committee
consisting
of
the
secretary
of
commerce
as
chairman
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
postmaster
general
and
the
chairman
of
the
shipping
board
to
make
a
survey
of
the
policies
being
pursued
under
the
act
of
in
respect
of
mail
contracts
to
inquire
into
its
workings
and
to
advise
the
postmaster
general
in
the
administration
of
the
act
in
particular
it
seemed
to
me
necessary
to
determine
if
the
result
of
the
contracts
already
let
would
assure
the
purpose
expressed
in
the
act
to
further
develop
an
american
merchant
marine
to
assure
its
permanence
in
the
transportation
of
the
foreign
trade
of
the
united
states
and
for
other
purposes
and
to
develop
a
coordinated
policy
by
which
these
purposes
may
be
translated
into
actualities
in
review
of
the
mail
contracts
already
awarded
it
was
found
that
they
aggregated
separate
awards
imposing
a
governmental
obligation
of
a
little
over
per
annum
provision
had
been
imposed
in
five
of
the
contracts
for
construction
of
new
vessels
with
which
to
replace
and
expand
services
these
requirements
come
to
a
total
of
vessels
in
the
year
period
aggregating
tons
some
other
conditions
in
the
contracts
had
not
worked
out
satisfactorily
that
study
has
now
been
substantially
completed
and
the
committee
has
advised
the
desirability
and
the
necessity
of
securing
much
larger
undertakings
as
to
service
and
new
construction
in
future
contracts
the
committee
at
this
time
is
recommending
the
advertising
of
additional
routes
making
substantial
requirements
for
the
construction
of
new
vessels
during
the
life
of
each
contract
recommended
a
total
of
new
vessels
will
be
required
under
the
contracts
proposed
about
half
of
which
will
be
required
to
be
built
during
the
next
three
years
the
capital
cost
of
this
new
construction
will
be
approximately
involving
approximately
gross
tons
should
bidders
be
found
who
will
make
these
undertakings
it
will
be
necessary
to
recommend
to
congress
an
increase
in
the
authorized
expenditure
by
the
post
office
of
about
annually
it
will
be
most
advantageous
to
grant
such
an
authority
a
conflict
as
to
the
administration
of
the
act
has
arisen
in
the
contention
of
persons
who
have
purchased
shipping
board
vessels
that
they
are
entitled
to
mail
contracts
irrespective
of
whether
they
are
the
lowest
bidder
the
post
office
on
the
other
hand
being
required
by
law
to
let
contracts
in
that
manner
it
is
urgent
that
congress
should
clarify
this
situation
the
banking
system
it
is
desirable
that
congress
should
consider
the
revision
of
some
portions
of
the
banking
law
the
development
of
group
and
chain
banking
presents
many
new
problems
the
question
naturally
arises
as
to
whether
if
allowed
to
expand
without
restraint
these
methods
would
dangerously
concentrate
control
of
credit
and
whether
they
would
not
in
any
event
seriously
threaten
one
of
the
fundamentals
of
the
american
credit
systemwhich
is
that
credit
which
is
based
upon
banking
deposits
should
be
controlled
by
persons
within
those
areas
which
furnish
these
deposits
and
thus
be
subject
to
the
restraints
of
local
interest
and
public
opinion
in
those
areas
to
some
degree
however
this
movement
of
chain
or
group
banking
is
a
groping
for
stronger
support
to
the
banks
and
a
more
secure
basis
for
these
institutions
the
growth
in
size
and
stability
of
the
metropolitan
banks
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
trend
in
the
country
districts
with
its
many
failures
and
the
losses
these
failures
have
imposed
upon
the
agricultural
community
the
relinquishment
of
charters
of
national
banks
in
great
commercial
centers
in
favor
of
state
charters
indicates
that
some
conditions
surround
the
national
banks
which
render
them
unable
to
compete
with
state
banks
and
their
withdrawal
results
in
weakening
our
national
banking
system
it
has
been
proposed
that
permission
should
be
granted
to
national
banks
to
engage
in
branch
banking
of
a
nature
that
would
preserve
within
limited
regions
the
local
responsibility
and
the
control
of
such
credit
institutions
all
these
subjects
however
require
careful
investigation
and
it
might
be
found
advantageous

to
create
a
joint
commission
embracing
members
of
the
congress
and
other
appropriate
federal
officials
for
subsequent
report
electrical
power
regulation
the
federal
power
commission
is
now
comprised
of
three
cabinet
officers
and
the
duties
involved
in
the
competent
conduct
of
the
growing
responsibilities
of
this
commission
far
exceed
the
time
and
attention
which
these
officials
can
properly
afford
from
other
important
duties
i
recommended
that
authority
be
given
for
the
appointment
of
fulltime
commissioners
to
replace
them
it
is
also
desirable
that
the
authority
of
the
commission
should
be
extended
to
certain
phases
of
power
regulation
the
nature
of
the
electric
utilities
industry
is
such
that
about
per
cent
of
all
power
generation
and
distribution
is
intrastate
in
character
and
most
of
the
states
have
developed
their
own
regulatory
systems
as
to
certificates
of
convenience
rates
and
profits
of
such
utilities
to
encroach
upon
their
authorities
and
responsibilities
would
be
an
encroachment
upon
the
rights
of
the
states
there
are
cases
however
of
interstate
character
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
to
meet
these
cases
it
would
be
most
desirable
if
a
method
could
be
worked
out
by
which
initial
action
may
be
taken
between
the
commissions
of
the
states
whose
joint
action
should
be
made
effective
by
the
federal
power
commission
with
a
reserve
to
act
on
its
own
motion
in
case
of
disagreement
or
nonaction
by
the
states
the
radio
commission
i
recommend
the
reorganization
of
the
radio
commission
into
a
permanent
body
from
its
present
temporary
status
the
requirement
of
the
present
law
that
the
commissioners
shall
be
appointed
from
specified
zones
should
be
abolished
and
a
general
provision
made
for
their
equitable
selection
from
different
parts
of
the
country
despite
the
effort
of
the
commissioners
the
present
method
develops
a
public
insistence
that
the
commissioners
are
specially
charged
with
supervision
of
radio
affairs
in
the
zone
from
which
each
is
appointed
as
a
result
there
is
danger
that
the
system
will
degenerate
from
a
national
system
into
five
regional
agencies
with
varying
practices
varying
policies
competitive
tendencies
and
consequent
failure
to
attain
its
utmost
capacity
for
service
to
the
people
as
a
whole
muscle
shoals
it
is
most
desirable
that
this
question
should
be
disposed
of
under
present
conditions
the
income
from
these
plants
is
less
than
could
otherwise
be
secured
for
its
use
and
more
especially
the
public
is
not
securing
the
full
benefits
which
could
be
obtained
from
them
it
is
my
belief
that
such
parts
of
these
plants
as
would
be
useful
and
the
revenues
from
the
remainder
should
be
dedicated
for
all
time
to
the
farmers
of
the
united
states
for
investigation
and
experimentation
on
a
commercial
scale
in
agricultural
chemistry
by
such
means
advancing
discoveries
of
science
can
be
systematically
applied
to
agricultural
need
and
development
of
the
chemical
industry
of
the
tennessee
valley
can
be
assured
i
do
not
favor
the
operation
by
the
government
of
either
power
or
manufacturing
business
except
as
an
unavoidable
byproduct
of
some
other
major
public
purpose
any
form
of
settlement
of
this
question
will
imply
entering
upon
a
contract
or
contracts
for
the
lease
of
the
plants
either
as
a
whole
or
in
parts
and
the
reservation
of
facilities
products
or
income
for
agricultural
purposes
the
extremely
technical
and
involved
nature
of
such
contracts
dealing
with
chemical
and
electrical
enterprises
added
to
the
unusual
difficulties
surrounding
these
special
plants
and
the
rapid
commercial
changes
now
in
progress
in
power
and
synthetic
nitrogen
manufacture
lead
me
to
suggest
that
congress
create
a
special
commission
not
to
investigate
and
report
as
in
the
past
but
with
authority
to
negotiate
and
complete
some
sort
of
contract
or
contracts
on
behalf
of
the
government
subject
of
course
to
such
general
requirements
as
congress
may
stipulate
boulder
dam
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
making
satisfactory
progress
in
negotiation
of
the
very
complex
contracts
required
for
the
sale
of
the
power
to
be
generated
at
this
project
these
contracts
must
assure
the
return
of
all
government
outlays
upon
the
project
i
recommend
that
the
necessary
funds
be
appropriated
for
the
initiation
of
this
work
as
soon
as
the
contracts
are
in
the
hands
of
congress
conservation
conservation
of
national
resources
is
a
fixed
policy
of
the
government
three
important
questions
bearing
upon
conservation
of
the
public
lands
have
become
urgent
conservation
of
our
oil
and
gas
resources
against
future
need
is
a
national
necessity
the
working
of
the
oil
permit
system
in
development
of
oil
and
gas
resources
on
the
public
domain
has
been
subject
to
great
abuse
i
considered
it
necessary
to
suspend
the
issuance
of
such
permits
and
to
direct
the
review
of
all
outstanding
permits
as
to
compliance
of
the
holders
with
the
law
the
purpose
was
not
only
to
end
such
abuse
but
to
place
the
government
in
position
to
review
the
entire
subject
we
are
also
confronted
with
a
major
problem
in
conservation
due
to
the
overgrazing
on
public
lands
the
effect
of
overgrazing
which
has
now
become
general
is
not
only
to
destroy
the
ranges
but
by
impairing
the
ground
coverage
seriously
to
menace
the
water
supply
in
many
parts
of
the
west
through
quick
runoff
spring
floods
and
autumn
drought
we
have
a
third
problem
of
major
dimensions
in
the
reconsideration
of
our
reclamation
policy
the
inclusion
of
most
of
the
available
lands
of
the
public
domain
in
existing
or
planned
reclamation
projects
largely
completes
the
original
purpose
of
the
reclamation
service
there
still
remains
the
necessity
for
extensive
storage
of
water
in
the
arid
states
which
renders
it
desirable
that
we
should
give
a
wider
vision
and
purpose
to
this
service
to
provide
for
careful
consideration
of
these
questions
and
also
of
better
division
of
responsibilities
in
them
as
between
the
state
and
federal
governments
including
the
possible
transfer
to
the
states
for
school
purposes
of
the
lands
unreserved
for
forests
parks
power
minerals
etc
i
have
appointed
a
commission
on
conservation
of
the
public
domain
with
a
membership
representing
the
major
public
land
states
and
at
the
same
time
the
public
at
large
i
recommend
that
congress
should
authorize
a
moderate
sum
to
defray
their
expenses
social
service
the
federal
government
provides
for
an
extensive
and
valuable
program
of
constructive
social
service
in
education
home
building
protection
to
women
and
children
employment
public
health
recreation
and
many
other
directions
in
a
broad
sense
federal
activity
in
these
directions
has
been
confined
to
research
and
dissemination
of
information
and
experience
and
at
most
to
temporary
subsidies
to
the
states
in
order
to
secure
uniform
advancement
in
practice
and
methods
any
other
attitude
by
the
federal
government
will
undermine
one
of
the
most
precious
possessions
of
the
american
people
that
is
local
and
individual
responsibility
we
should
adhere
to
this
policy
federal
officials
can
however
make
a
further
and
most
important
contribution
by
leadership
in
stimulation
of
the
community
and
voluntary
agencies
and
by
extending
federal
assistance
in
organization
of
these
forces
and
bringing
about
cooperation
among
them
as
an
instance
of
this
character
i
have
recently
in
cooperation
with
the
secretaries
of
interior
and
labor
laid
the
foundations
of
an
exhaustive
inquiry
into
the
facts
precedent
to
a
nationwide
white
house
conference
on
child
health
and
protection
this
cooperative
movement
among
interested
agencies
will
impose
no
expense
upon
the
government
similar
nationwide
conferences
will
be
called
in
connection
with
better
housing
and
recreation
at
a
later
date
in
view
of
the
considerable
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
policies
which
should
be
pursued
by
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
education
i
have
appointed
a
committee
representative
of
the
important
educational
associations
and
others
to
investigate
and
present
recommendations
in
cooperation
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
i
have
also
appointed
a
voluntary
committee
of
distinguished
membership
to
assist
in
a
nationwide
movement
for
abolition
of
illiteracy
i
have
recommended
additional
appropriations
for
the
federal
employment
service
in
order
that
it
may
more
fully
cover
its
cooperative
work
with
state
and
local
services
i
have
also
recommended
additional
appropriations
for
the
womens
and
childrens
bureaus
for
much
needed
research
as
to
facts
which
i
feel
will
prove
most
helpful
public
health
the
advance
in
scientific
discovery
as
to
disease
and
health
imposes
new
considerations
upon
us
the
nation
as
a
whole
is
vitally
interested
in
the
health
of
all
the
people
in
protection
from
spread
of
contagious
disease
in
the
relation
of
physical
and
mental
disabilities
to
criminality
and
in
the
economic
and
moral
advancement
which
is
fundamentally
associated
with
sound
body
and
mind
the
organization
of
preventive
measures
and
health
education
in
its
personal
application
is
the
province
of
public
health
service
such
organization
should
be
as
universal
as
public
education
its
support
is
a
proper
burden
upon
the
taxpayer
it
can
not
be
organized
with
success
either
in
its
sanitary
or
educational
phases
except
under
public
authority
it
should
be
based
upon
local
and
state
responsibility
but
i
consider
that
the
federal
government
has
an
obligation
of
contribution
to
the
establishment
of
such
agencies
in
the
practical
working
out
of
organization
exhaustive
experiment
and
trial
have
demonstrated
that
the
base
should
be
competent
organization
of
the
municipality
county
or
other
local
unit
most
of
our
municipalities
and
some
rural
counties
out
of
now
have
some
such
unit
organization
where
highly
developed
a
health
unit
comprises
at
least
a
physician
sanitary
engineer
and
community
nurse
with
the
addition
in
some
cases
of
another
nurse
devoted
to
the
problems
of
maternity
and
children
such
organization
gives
at
once
a
fundamental
control
of
preventive
measures
and
assist
s
in
community
instruction
the
federal
government
through
its
interest
in
control
of
contagion
acting
through
the
united
states
public
health
service
and
the
state
agencies
has
in
the
past
and
should
in
the
future
concern
itself
with
this
development
particularly
in
the
many
rural
sections
which
are
unfortunately
far
behind
in
progress
some
parts
of
the
funds
contributed
under
the
sheppardtowner
act
through
the
childrens
bureau
of
the
department
of
labor
have
also
found
their
way
into
these
channels
i
recommend
to
the
congress
that
the
purpose
of
the
sheppardtowner
act
should
be
continued
through
the
childrens
bureau
for
a
limited
period
of
years
and
that
the
congress
should
consider
the
desirability
of
confining
the
use
of
federal
funds
by
the
states
to
the
building
up
of
such
county
or
other
local
units
and
that
such
outlay
should
be
positively
coordinated
with
the
funds
expended
through
the
united
states
public
health
service
directed
to
other
phases
of
the
same
county
or
other
local
unit
organization
all
funds
appropriated
should
of
course
be
applied
through
the
states
so
that
the
public
health
program
of
the
county
or
local
unit
will
be
efficiently
coordinated
with
that
of
the
whole
state
federal
prisons
closely
related
to
crime
conditions
is
the
administration
of
the
federal
prison
system
our
federal
penal
institutions
are
overcrowded
and
this
condition
is
daily
becoming
worse
the
parole
and
probation
systems
are
inadequate
these
conditions
make
it
impossible
to
perform
the
work
of
personal
reconstruction
of
prisoners
so
as
to
prepare
them
for
return
to
the
duties
of
citizenship
in
order
to
relieve
the
pressing
evils
i
have
directed
the
temporary
transfer
of
the
army
disciplinary
barracks
at
leavenworth
to
the
department
of
justice
for
use
as
a
federal
prison
not
only
is
this
temporary
but
it
is
inadequate
for
present
needs
we
need
some
new
federal
prisons
and
a
reorganization
of
our
probation
and
parole
systems
and
there
should
be
established
in
the
department
of
justice
a
bureau
of
prisons
with
a
sufficient
force
to
deal
adequately
with
the
growing
activities
of
our
prison
institutions
authorization
for
the
improvements
should
be
given
speedily
with
initial
appropriations
to
allow
the
construction
of
the
new
institutions
to
be
undertaken
at
once
immigration
restriction
of
immigration
has
from
every
aspect
proved
a
sound
national
policy
our
pressing
problem
is
to
formulate
a
method
by
which
the
limited
number
of
immigrants
whom
we
do
welcome
shall
be
adapted
to
our
national
setting
and
our
national
needs
i
have
been
opposed
to
the
basis
of
the
quotas
now
in
force
and
i
have
hoped
that
we
could
find
some
practical
method
to
secure
what
i
believe
should
be
our
real
national
objective
that
is
fitness
of
the
immigrant
as
to
physique
character
training
and
our
need
of
service
perhaps
some
system
of
priorities
within
the
quotas
could
produce
these
results
and
at
the
same
time
enable
some
hardships
in
the
present
system
to
be
cleared
up
i
recommend
that
the
congress
should
give
the
subject
further
study
in
which
the
executive
departments
will
gladly
cooperate
with
the
hope
of
discovering
such
method
as
will
more
fully
secure
our
national
necessities
veterans
it
has
been
the
policy
of
our
government
almost
from
its
inception
to
make
provision
for
the
men
who
have
been
disabled
in
defense
of
our
country
this
policy
should
be
maintained
originally
it
took
the
form
of
land
grants
and
pensions
this
system
continued
until
our
entry
into
the
world
war
the
congress
at
that
time
inaugurated
a
new
plan
of
compensation
rehabilitation
hospitalization
medical
care
and
treatment
and
insurance
whereby
benefits
were
awarded
to
those
veterans
and
their
immediate
dependents
whose
disabilities
were
attributable
to
their
war
service
the
basic
principle
in
this
legislation
is
sound
in
a
desire
to
eliminate
all
possibilities
of
injustice
due
to
difficulties
in
establishing
service
connection
of
disabilities
these
principles
have
been
to
some
degree
extended
veterans
whose
diseases
or
injuries
have
become
apparent
within
a
brief
period
after
the
war
are
now
receiving
compensation
insurance
benefits
have
been
liberalized
emergency
officers
are
now
receiving
additional
benefits
the
doors
of
the
governments
hospitals
have
been
opened
to
all
veterans
even
though
their
diseases
or
injuries
were
not
the
result
of
their
war
service
in
addition
adjusted
service
certificates
have
been
issued
to
veterans
this
in
itself
will
mean
an
expenditure
of
nearly
before
in
addition
to
the
which
we
are
now
appropriating
annually
for
our
veterans
relief
the
administration
of
all
laws
concerning
the
veterans
and
their
dependents
has
been
upon
the
basis
of
dealing
generously
humanely
and
justly
while
some
inequalities
have
arisen
substantial
and
adequate
care
has
been
given
and
justice
administered
further
improvement
in
administration
may
require
some
amendment
from
time
to
time
to
the
law
but
care
should
be
taken
to
see
that
such
changes
conform
to
the
basic
principles
of
the
legislation
i
am
convinced
that
we
will
gain
in
efficiency
economy
and
more
uniform
administration
and
better
definition
of
national
policies
if
the
pension
bureau
the
national
home
for
volunteer
soldiers
and
the
veterans
bureau
are
brought
together
under
a
single
agency
the
total
appropriations
to
these
agencies
now
exceed
per
annum
civil
service
approximately
fourfifths
of
all
the
employees
in
the
executive
civil
service
now
occupy
positions
subject
to
competitive
examination
under
the
civil
service
law
there
are
however
still
commanding
opportunities
for
extending
the
system
these
opportunities
lie
within
the
province
of
congress
and
not
the
president
i
recommend
that
a
further
step
be
taken
by
authorization
that
appointments
of
thirdclass
postmasters
be
made
under
the
civil
service
law
departmental
reorganization
this
subject
has
been
under
consideration
for
over
years
it
was
promised
by
both
political
parties
in
the
recent
campaign
it
has
been
repeatedly
examined
by
committees
and
commissionscongressional
executive
and
voluntary
the
conclusions
of
these
investigations
have
been
unanimous
that
reorganization
is
a
necessity
of
sound
administration
of
economy
of
more
effective
governmental
policies
and
of
relief
to
the
citizen
from
unnecessary
harassment
in
his
relations
with
a
multitude
of
scattered
governmental
agencies
but
the
presentation
of
any
specific
plan
at
once
enlivens
opposition
from
every
official
whose
authority
may
be
curtailed
or
who
fears
his
position
is
imperiled
by
such
a
result
of
bureaus
and
departments
which
wish
to
maintain
their
authority
and
activities
of
citizens
and
their
organizations
who
are
selfishly
interested
or
who
are
inspired
by
fear
that
their
favorite
bureau
may
in
a
new
setting
be
less
subject
to
their
influence
or
more
subject
to
some
other
influence
it
seems
to
me
that
the
essential
principles
of
reorganization
are
two
in
number
first
all
administrative
activities
of
the
same
major
purpose
should
be
placed
in
groups
under
singleheaded
responsibility
second
all
executive
and
administrative
functions
should
be
separated
from
boards
and
commissions
and
placed
under
individual
responsibility
while
quasilegislative
and
quasijudicial
and
broadly
advisory
functions
should
be
removed
from
individual
authority
and
assigned
to
boards
and
commissions
indeed
these
are
the
fundamental
principles
upon
which
our
government
was
founded
and
they
are
the
principles
which
have
been
adhered
to
in
the
whole
development
of
our
business
structure
and
they
are
the
distillation
of
the
common
sense
of
generations
for
instance
the
conservation
of
national
resources
is
spread
among
eight
agencies
in
five
departments
they
suffer
from
conflict
and
overlap
there
is
no
proper
development
and
adherence
to
broad
national
policies
and
no
central
point
where
the
searchlight
of
public
opinion
may
concentrate
itself
these
functions
should
be
grouped
under
the
direction
of
some
such
official
as
an
assistant
secretary
of
conservation
the
particular
department
or
cabinet
officer
under
which
such
a
group
should
be
placed
is
of
secondary
importance
to
the
need
of
concentration
the
same
may
be
said
of
educational
services
of
merchant
marine
aids
of
public
works
of
public
health
of
veterans
services
and
many
others
the
component
parts
of
which
are
widely
scattered
in
the
various
departments
and
independent
agencies
it
is
desirable
that
we
first
have
experience
with
these
different
groups
in
action
before
we
create
new
departments
these
may
be
necessary
later
on
with
this
background
of
all
previous
experience
i
can
see
no
hope
for
the
development
of
a
sound
reorganization
of
the
government
unless
congress
be
willing
to
delegate
its
authority
over
the
problem
subject
to
defined
principles
to
the
executive
who
should
act
upon
approval
of
a
joint
committee
of
congress
or
with
the
reservation
of
power
of
revision
by
congress
within
some
limited
period
adequate
for
its
consideration
prohibition
the
first
duty
of
the
president
under
his
oath
of
office
is
to
secure
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
enacted
to
give
effect
to
the
eighteenth
amendment
is
far
from
satisfactory
and
this
is
in
part
due
to
the
inadequate
organization
of
the
administrative
agencies
of
the
federal
government
with
the
hope
of
expediting
such
reorganization
i
requested
on
june
last
that
congress
should
appoint
a
joint
committee
to
collaborate
with
executive
agencies
in
preparation
of
legislation
it
would
be
helpful
if
it
could
be
so
appointed
the
subject
has
been
earnestly
considered
by
the
law
enforcement
commission
and
the
administrative
officials
of
the
government
our
joint
conclusions
are
that
certain
steps
should
be
taken
at
once
first
there
should
be
an
immediate
concentration
of
responsibility
and
strengthening
of
enforcement
agencies
of
the
federal
government
by
transfer
to
the
department
of
justice
of
the
federal
functions
of
detection
and
to
a
considerable
degree
of
prosecution
which
are

now
lodged
in
the
prohibition
bureau
in
the
treasury
and
at
the
same
time
the
control
of
the
distribution
of
industrial
alcohol
and
legalized
beverages
should
remain
in
the
treasury
second
provision
should
be
made
for
relief
of
congestion
in
the
federal
courts
by
modifying
and
simplifying
the
procedure
for
dealing
with
the
large
volume
of
petty
prosecutions
under
various
federal
acts
third
there
should
be
a
codification
of
the
laws
relating
to
prohibition
to
avoid
the
necessity
which
now
exists
of
resorting
to
more
than
statutes
enacted
at
various
times
over
years
technical
defects
in
these
statutes
that
have
been
disclosed
should
be
cured
i
would
add
to
these
recommendations
the
desirability
of
reorganizing
the
various
services
engaged
in
the
prevention
of
smuggling
into
one
border
patrol
under
the
coast
guard
further
recommendations
upon
the
subject
as
a
whole
will
be
developed
after
further
examination
by
the
law
enforcement
commission
but
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
any
criminal
law
will
ever
be
fully
enforced
so
long
as
criminals
exist
the
district
of
columbia
should
be
the
model
of
city
law
enforcement
in
the
nation
while
conditions
here
are
much
better
than
in
many
other
cities
they
are
far
from
perfect
and
this
is
due
in
part
to
the
congestion
of
criminal
cases
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
resulting
in
long
delays
furthermore
there
is
need
for
legislation
in
the
district
supplementing
the
national
prohibition
act
more
sharply
defining
and
enlarging
the
duties
and
powers
of
the
district
commissioners
and
the
police
of
the
district
and
opening
the
way
for
better
cooperation
in
the
enforcement
of
prohibition
between
the
district
officials
and
the
prohibition
officers
of
the
federal
government
it
is
urgent
that
these
conditions
be
remedied
law
enforcement
and
observance
no
one
will
look
with
satisfaction
upon
the
volume
of
crime
of
all
kinds
and
the
growth
of
organized
crime
in
our
country
we
have
pressing
need
so
to
organize
our
system
of
administering
criminal
justice
as
to
establish
full
vigor
and
effectiveness
we
need
to
reestablish
faith
that
the
highest
interests
of
our
country
are
served
by
insistence
upon
the
swift
and
evenhanded
administration
of
justice
to
all
offenders
whether
they
be
rich
or
poor
that
we
shall
effect
improvement
is
vital
to
the
preservation
of
our
institutions
it
is
the
most
serious
issue
before
our
people
under
the
authority
of
congress
i
have
appointed
a
national
commission
on
law
observance
and
enforcement
for
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
entire
problem
of
the
enforcement
of
our
laws
and
the
improvement
of
our
judicial
system
including
the
special
problems
and
abuses
growing
out
of
the
prohibition
laws
the
commission
has
been
invited
to
make
the
widest
inquiry
into
the
shortcomings
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
into
the
causes
and
remedies
for
them
it
has
organized
its
work
under
subcommittees
dealing
with
the
many
contributory
causes
of
our
situation
and
has
enlisted
the
aid
of
investigators
in
fields
requiring
special
consideration
i
am
confident
that
as
a
result
of
its
studies
now
being
carried
forward
it
will
make
a
notable
contribution
to
the
solution
of
our
pressing
problems
pending
further
legislation
the
department
of
justice
has
been
striving
to
weed
out
inefficiency
wherever
it
exists
to
stimulate
activity
on
the
part
of
its
prosecuting
officers
and
to
use
increasing
care
in
examining
into
the
qualifications
of
those
appointed
to
serve
as
prosecutors
the
department
is
seeking
systematically
to
strengthen
the
law
enforcement
agencies
week
by
week
and
month
by
month
not
by
dramatic
displays
but
by
steady
pressure
by
removal
of
negligent
officials
and
by
encouragement
and
assistance
to
the
vigilant
during
the
course
of
these
efforts
it
has
been
revealed
that
in
some
districts
causes
contributing
to
the
congestion
of
criminal
dockets
and
to
delays
and
inefficiency
in
prosecutions
have
been
lack
of
sufficient
forces
in
the
offices
of
united
states
attorneys
clerks
of
courts
and
marshals
these
conditions
tend
to
clog
the
machinery
of
justice
the
last
conference
of
senior
circuit
judges
has
taken
note
of
them
and
indorsed
the
departments
proposals
for
improvement
increases
in
appropriations
are
necessary
and
will
be
asked
for
in
order
to
reenforce
these
offices
the
orderly
administration
of
the
law
involves
more
than
the
mere
machinery
of
law
enforcement
the
efficient
use
of
that
machinery
and
a
spirit
in
our
people
in
support
of
law
are
alike
essential
we
have
need
for
improvement
in
both
however
much
we
may
perfect
the
mechanism
still
if
the
citizen
who
is
himself
dependent
upon
some
laws
for
the
protection
of
all
that
he
has
and
all
that
he
holds
dear
shall
insist
on
selecting
the
particular
laws
which
he
will
obey
he
undermines
his
own
safety
and
that
of
his
country
his
attitude
may
obscure
but
it
can
not
conceal
the
ugly
truth
that
the
lawbreaker
whoever
he
may
be
is
the
enemy
of
society
we
can
no
longer
gloss
over
the
unpleasant
reality
which
should
be
made
vital
in
the
consciousness
of
every
citizen
that
he
who
condones
or
traffics
with
crime
who
is
indifferent
to
it
and
to
the
punishment
of
the
criminal
or
to
the
lax
performance
of
official
duty
is
himself
the
most
effective
agency
for
the
breakdown
of
society
law
can
not
rise
above
its
source
in
good
citizenshipin
what
rightminded
men
most
earnestly
believe
and
desire
if
the
law
is
upheld
only
by
government
officials
then
all
law
is
at
an
end
our
laws
are
made
by
the
people
themselves
theirs
is
the
right
to
work
for
their
repeal
but
until
repeal
it
is
an
equal
duty
to
observe
them
and
demand
their
enforcement
i
have
been
gratified
at
the
awakening
sense
of
this
responsibility
in
our
citizens
during
the
past
few
months
and
gratified
that
many
instances
have
occurred
which
refuted
the
cynicism
which
has
asserted
that
our
system
could
not
convict
those
who
had
defied
the
law
and
possessed
the
means
to
resist
its
execution
these
things
reveal
a
moral
awakening
both
in
the
people
and
in
officials
which
lies
at
the
very
foundation
of
the
rule
of
law
conclusion
the
test
of
the
rightfulness
of
our
decisions
must
be
whether
we
have
sustained
and
advanced
the
ideals
of
the
american
people
selfgovernment
in
its
foundations
of
local
government
justice
whether
to
the
individual
or
to
the
group
ordered
liberty
freedom
from
domination
open
opportunity
and
equality

the

and

of

the
lessening
of

the
white

december

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
no
congress
of
the
united
states
ever
assembled
on
surveying
the
state
of
the
union
has
met
with
a
more
pleasing
prospect
than
that
which
appears
at
the
present
time
in
the
domestic
field
there
is
tranquility
and
contentment
harmonious
relations
between
management
and
wage
earner
freedom
from
industrial
strife
and
the
highest
record
of
years
of
prosperity
in
the
foreign
field
there
is
peace
the
good
will
which
comes
from
mutual
understanding
and
the
knowledge
that
the
problems
which
a
short
time
ago
appeared
so
ominous
are
yielding
to
the
touch
of
manifest
friendship
the
great
wealth
created
by
our
enterprise
and
industry
and
saved
by
our
economy
has
had
the
widest
distribution
among
our
own
people
and
has
gone
out
in
a
steady
stream
to
serve
the
charity
and
the
business
of
the
world
the
requirements
of
existence
have
passed
beyond
the
standard
of
necessity
into
the
region
of
luxury
enlarging
production
is
consumed
by
an
increasing
demand
at
home
and
an
expanding
commerce
abroad
the
country
can
regard
the
present
with
satisfaction
and
anticipate
the
future
with
optimism
the
main
source
of
these
unexampled
blessings
lies
in
the
integrity
and
character
of
the
american
people
they
have
had
great
faith
which
they
have
supplemented
with
mighty
works
they
have
been
able
to
put
trust
in
each
other
and
trust
in
their
government
their
candor
in
dealing
with
foreign
governments
has
commanded
respect
and
confidence
yet
these
remarkable
powers
would
have
been
exerted
almost
in
vain
without
the
constant
cooperation
and
careful
administration
of
the
federal
government
we
have
been
coming
into
a
period
which
may
be
fairly
characterized
as
a
conservation
of
our
national
resources
wastefulness
in
public
business
and
private
enterprise
has
been
displaced
by
constructive
economy
this
has
been
accomplished
by
bringing
our
domestic
and
foreign
relations
more
and
more
under
a
reign
of
law
a
rule
of
force
has
been
giving
way
to
a
rule
of
reason
we
have
substituted
for
the
vicious
circle
of
increasing
expenditures
increasing
tax
rates
and
diminishing
profits
the
charmed
circle
of
diminishing
expenditures
diminishing
tax
rates
and
increasing
profits
four
times
we
have
made
a
drastic
revision
of
our
internal
revenue
system
abolishing
many
taxes
and
substantially
reducing
almost
all
others
each
time
the
resulting
stimulation
to
business
has
so
increased
taxable
incomes
and
profits
that
a
surplus
has
been
reduced
onethird
of
the
national
debt
has
been
paid
while
much
of
the
other
twothirds
has
been
refunded
at
lower
rates
and
these
savings
of
interest
and
constant
economies
have
enabled
us
to
repeat
the
satisfying
process
of
more
tax
reductions
under
this
sound
and
healthful
encouragement
the
national
income
has
increased
nearly
per
cent
until
it
is
estimated
to
stand
well
over
it
gas
been
a
method
which
has
performed
the
seeming
miracle
of
leaving
a
much
greater
percentage
of
earnings
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayers
with
scarcely
any
diminution
of
the
government
revenue
that
is
constructive
economy
in
the
highest
degree
it
is
the
corner
stone
of
prosperity
it
should
not
fail
to
be
continued
this
action
began
by
the
application
of
economy
to
public
expenditure
if
it
is
to
be
permanent
it
must
be
made
so
by
the
repeated
application
of
economy
there
is
no
surplus
on
which
to
base
further
tax
revision
at
this
time
last
june
the
estimates
showed
a
threatened
deficit
for
the
current
fiscal
year
of
under
my
direction
the
departments
began
saving
all
they
could
out
of
their
present
appropriations
the
last
tax
reduction
brought
an
encouraging
improvement
in
business
beginning
early
in
october
which
will
also
increase
our
revenue
the
combination
of
economy
and
good
times
now
indicates
a
surplus
of
about
this
is
a
margin
of
less
than
i
percent
on
out
expenditures
and
makes
it
obvious
that
the
treasury
is
in
no
condition
to
undertake
increases
in
expenditures
to
be
made
before
june
it
is
necessary
therefore
during
the
present
session
to
refrain
from
new
appropriations
for
immediate
outlay
or
if
such
are
absolutely
required
to
provide
for
them
by
new
revenue
otherwise
we
shall
reach
the
end
of
the
year
with
the
unthinkable
result
of
an
unbalanced
budget
for
the
first
time
during
my
term
of
office
we
face
that
contingency
i
am
certain
that
the
congress
would
not
pass
and
i
should
not
feel
warranted
in
approving
legislation
which
would
involve
us
in
that
financial
disgrace
on
the
whole
the
finances
of
the
government
are
most
satisfactory
last
year
the
national
debt
was
reduced
about
the
refunding
and
retirement
of
the
second
and
third
liberty
loans
have
just
been
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion
which
will
save
about
a
year
in
interest
the
unpaid
balance
has
been
arranged
in
maturities
convenient
for
carrying
out
our
permanent
debtpaying
program
the
enormous
savings
made
have
not
been
at
the
expense
of
any
legitimate
public
need
the

has
been
kept
up
and
many
improvements
are
tinder
way
while
its

is
fully
manned
and
the
general
efficiency
of
operation
has
increased
we
have
been
enabled
to
undertake
many
new
enterprises
among
these
are
the
adjusted
compensation
of
the
veterans
of
the

which
is
costing
us
a
year
amortizing
our
liability

are

of

we
turn
from

to

likewise
perceive
peace

the
sixth
international
conference
of

was
held
at

it

to
a
better

among
the
nations
eleven
important

were
signed

to

conference
on
conciliation

arbitration
which
meets
in

on

all
the

have
accepted
and
the
expectation
is
justified
that
important
progress
will
be
made
in
methods
for
resolving

our

than
at
any

since

many
misunderstandings
have
been

the
most

promise
a
final
adjustment
of
all
unsettled

it
is
exceedingly
gratifying
that

bring
our
two

many

china
the
situation
in
china
which
a
few
months
ago
was
so
threatening
as
to
call
for
the
dispatch
of
a
large
additional
force
has
been
much
composed
the
nationalist
government
has
established
itself
over
the
country
and
promulgated
a
new
organic
law
announcing
a
program
intended
to
promote
the
political
and
economic
welfare
of
the
people
we
have
recognized
this
government
encouraged
its
progress
and
have
negotiated
a
treaty
restoring
to
china
complete
tariff
autonomy
and
guaranteeing
our
citizens
against
discriminations
our

in
that
quarter
is
increasing

is
a
recommendation
for
the
settlement
of
the
greek

and
the
austrian
debt
both
of
these
are
comparatively
small

our

can
afford
to
be
generous
the

of
these

a
longtime
moratorium

it
is
understood
will
be
waived

on
the

basis
which
we
have
extended

countries
peace
treaty
one
of
the
most
important
treaties
ever
laid
before
the
senate
of
the
united
states
will
be
that
which
the
nations
recently
signed
at
paris
and
to
which
other
nations
have
declared
their
intention
to
adhere
renouncing
war
as
a
national
policy
and
agreeing
to
resort
only
to
peaceful
means
for
the
adjustment
of
international
differences
it
is
the
most
solemn
declaration
against
war
the
most
positive
adherence
to
peace
that
it
is
possible
for
sovereign
nations
to
make
it
does
not
supersed
e
our
inalienable
sovereign
right
and
duty
of
national
defense
or
undertake
to
commit
us
before
the
event
to
any
mode
of
action
which
the
congress
might
decide
to
be
wise
if
ever
the
treaty
should
be
broken
but
it
is
a
new
standard
in
the
world
around
which
can
rally
the
informed
and
enlightened
opinion
of
nations
to
prevent
their
governments
from
being
forced
into
hostile
action
by
the
temporary
outbreak
of
international
animosities
the
observance
of
this
covenant
so
simple
and
so
straightforward
promises
more
for
the
peace
of
the
world
than
any
other
agreement
ever
negotiated
among
the
nations
national
defense
the
first
duty
of
our
government
to
its
own
citizens
and
foreigners
within
its
borders
is
the
preservation
of
order
unless
and
until
that
duty
is
met
a
government
is
not
even
eligible
for
recognition
among
the
family
of
nations
the
advancement
of
world
civilization
likewise
is
dependent
upon
that
order
among
the
people
of
different
countries
which
we
term
peace
to
insure
our
citizens
against
the
infringement
of
their
legal
rights
at
home
and
abroad
to
preserve
order
liberty
and
peace
by
making
the
law
supreme
we
have
an
army
and
a
navy
both
of
these
are
organized
for
defensive
purposes
our
army
could
not
be
much
reduced
but
does
not
need
to
be
increased
such
new
housing
and
repairs
as
are
necessary
are
tinder
way
and
the
year
program
in
aviation
is
being
put
into
effect
in
both
branches
of
our
service
our
navy
according
to
generally
accepted
standards
is
deficient
in
cruisers
we
have
comparatively
new
vessels
that
are
old
and
to
be
built
it
is
evident
that
renewals
and
replacements
must
be
provided
this
matter
was
thoroughly
canvassed
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
and
does
not
need
restatement
the
bill
before
the
senate
with
the
elimination
of
the
time
clause
should
be
passed
we
have
no
intention
of
competing
with
any
other
country
this
building
program
is
for
necessary
replacements
and
to
meet
our
needs
for
defense
the
cost
of
national
defense
is
stupendous
it
has
increased
in
the
past
four
years
the
estimated
expenditure
for
is
while
this
is
made
up
of
many
items
it
is
after
all
mostly
dependent
upon
numbers
our
defensive
needs
do
not
can
for
any
increase
in
the
number
of
men
in
the
army
or
the
navy
we
have
reached
the
limit
of
what
we
ought
to
expend
for
that
purpose
i
wish
to
repeat
again
for
the
benefit
of
the
timid
and
the
suspicious
that
this
country
is
neither
militaristic
nor
imperialistic
many
people
at
home
and
abroad
who
constantly
make
this
charge
are
the
same
ones
who
are
even
more
solicitous
to
have
us
extend
assistance
to
foreign
countries
when
such
assistance
is
granted
the
inevitable
result
is
that
we
have
foreign
interests
for
us
to
refuse
the
customary
support
and
protection
of
such
interests
would
be
in
derogation
of
the
sovereignty
of
this
nation
our
largest
foreign
interests
are
in
the
british
empire
france
and
italy
because
we
are
constantly
solicitous
for
those
interests
i
doubt
if
anyone
would
suppose
that
those
countries
feel
we
harbor
toward
them
any
militaristic
or
imperialistic
design
as
for
smaller
countries
we
certainly
do
not
want
any
of
them
we
are
more
anxious
than
they
are
to
have
their
sovereignty
respected
our
entire
influence
is
in
behalf
of
their
independence
cuba
stands
as
a
witness
to
our
adherence
to
this
principle
the
position
of
this
government
relative
to
the
limitation
of
armaments
the
results
already
secured
and
the
developments
up
to
the
present
time
are
so
well
known
to
the
congress
that
they
do
not
require
any
restatement
veterans
the
magnitude
of
our
present
system
of
veterans
relief
is
without
precedent
and
the
results
have
been
farreaching
for
years
a
service
pension
has
been
granted
to
the
grand
army
and
lately
to
the
survivors
of
the
spanishamerican
war
at
the
time
we
entered
the
world
war
however
congress
departed
from
the
usual
pension
system
followed
by
our
government
eleven
years
have
elapsed
since
our
laws
were
first
enacted
initiating
a
system
of
compensation
rehabilitation
hospitalization
and
insurance
for
the
disabled
of
the
world
war
and
their
dependents
the
administration
of
all
the
laws
concerning
relief
has
been
a
difficult
task
but
it
can
safely
be
stated
that
these
measures
have
omitted
nothing
in
their
desire
to
deal
generously
and
humanely
we
should
continue
to
foster
this
system
and
provide
all
the
facilities
necessary
for
adequate
care
it
is
the
conception
of
our
government
that
the
pension
roll
is
an
honor
roll
it
should
include
all
those
who
are
justly
entitled
to
its
benefits
but
exclude
all
others
annual
expenditures
for
all
forms
of
veterans
relief
now
approximate
and
are
increasing
from
year
to
year
it
is
doubtful
if
the
peak
of
expenditures
will
be
reached
even
under
present
legislation
for
sonic
time
yet
to
come
further
amendments
to
the
existing
law
will
be
suggested
by
the
american
legion
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars
of
the
united
states
the
disabled
american
veterans
of
the
world
war
and
other
like
organizations
and
it
may
be
necessary
for
administrative
purposes
or
in
order
to
remove
some
existing
inequalities
in
the
present
law
to
make
further
changes
i
am
sure
that
such
recommendations
its
may
be
submitted
to
the
congress
will
receive
your
careful
consideration
but
because
of
the
vast
expenditure
now
being
made
each
year
with
every
assurance
that
it
will
increase
and
because
of
the
great
liberality
of
the
existing
law
the
proposal
of
any
additional
legislation
dealing
with
this
subject
should
receive
most
searching
scrutiny
from
the
congress
you
are
familiar
with
the
suggestion
that
the
various
public
agencies
now
dealing
with
matters
of
veterans
relief
be
consolidated
in
one
government
department
some
advantages
to
this
plan
seem
apparent
especially
in
the
simplification
of
administration
find
in
the
opportunity
of
bringing
about
a
greater
uniformity
in
the
application
of
veterans
relief
i
recommend
that
a
survey
be
made
by
the
proper
committees
of
congress
dealing
with
this
subject
in
order
to
determine
whether
legislation
to
secure
this
consolidation
is
desirable
agriculture
the
past
year
has
been
marked
by
notable
though
not
uniform
improvement
in
agriculture
the
general
purchasing
power
of
farm
products
and
the
volume
of
production
have
advanced
this
means
not
only
further
progress
in
overcoming
the
price
disparity
into
which
agriculture
was
plunged
in
but
also
increased
efficiency
on
the
part
of
farmers
and
a
wellgrounded
confidence
in
the
future
of
agriculture
the
livestock
industry
has
attained
the
best
balance
for
many
years
and
is
prospering
conspicuously
dairymen
beef
producers
and
poultrymen
are
receiving
substantially
larger
returns
than
last
year
cotton
although
lower
in
price
than
at
this
time
last
year
was
produced
in
greater
volume
and
the
prospect
for
cotton
incomes
is
favorable
but
progress
is
never
uniform
in
a
vast
and
highly
diversified
agriculture
or
industry
cash
grains
hay
tobacco
and
potatoes
will
bring
somewhat
smaller
returns
this
year
than
last
present
indications
are
however
that
the
gross
farm
income
will
be
somewhat
larger
than
in
the
crop
year
when
the
total
was
the
corresponding
figure
for
was
and
in
still
better
results
would
have
been
secured
this
year
had
there
not
been
an
undue
increase
in
the
production
of
certain
crops
this
is
particularly
true
of
potatoes
which
have
sold
at
an
unremunerative
price
or
at
a
loss
as
a
direct
result
of
overexpansion
of
acreage
the
present
status
of
agriculture
although
greatly
improved
over
that
of
a
few
years
ago
bespeaks
the
need
of
further
improvement
which
calls
for
determined
effort
of
farmers
themselves
encouraged
and
assisted
by
wise
public
policy
the
government
has
been
and
must
continue
to
be
alive
to
the
needs
of
agriculture
in
the
past
eight
years
more
constructive
legislation
of
direct
benefit
to
agriculture
has
been
adopted
than
during
any
other
period
the
department
of
agriculture
has
been
broadened
and
reorganized
to
insure
greater
efficiency
the
department
is
laying
greater
stress
on
the
economic
and
business
phases
of
agriculture
it
is
lending
every
possible
assistance
to
cooperative
marketing
associations
regulatory
and
research
work
have
been
segregated
in
order
that
each
field
may
be
served
more
effectively
i
can
not
too
strongly
commend
in
the
field
of
fact
finding
the
research
work
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
the
state
experiment
stations
the
department
now
receives
annually
more
for
research
than
in
in
addition
the
funds
paid
to
the
states
for
experimentation
purposes
under
the
purnell
act
constitute
an
annual
increase
in
federal
payments
to
state
agricultural
experiment
stations
of
over
the
amount
appropriated
in
the
program
of
support
for
research
may
wisely
be
continued
and
expanded
since
we
have
appropriated
nearly

and
this
sum
is
to
be

under
authorization
by
the
capperketcham
act
the
surplus
problem
while
these
developments
in
fundamental
research
regulation
and
dissemination
of
agricultural
information
are
of
distinct
help
to
agriculture
additional
effort
is
needed
the
surplus
problem
demands
attention
as
emphasized
in
my
last
message
the
government
should
assume
no
responsibility
in
normal
times
for
crop
surplus
clearly
due
to
overextended
acreage
the
government
should
however
provide
reliable
information
as
a
guide
to
private
effort
and
in
this
connection
fundamental
research
on
prospective
supply
and
demand
as
a
guide
to
production
and
marketing
should
be
encouraged
expenditure
of
public
funds
to
bring
in
more
new
land
should
have
most
searching
scrutiny
so
long
as
our
farmers
face
unsatisfactory
prices
for
crops
and
livestock
produced
on
land
already
under
cultivation
every
proper
effort
should
be
made
to
put
land
to
uses
for
which
it
is
adapted
the
reforestation
of
land
best
suited
for
timber
production
is
progressing
and
should
be
encouraged
and
to
this
end
the
forest
taxation
inquiry
was
instituted
to
afford
a
practical
guide
for
public
polic
y
improvement
has
been
made
in
grazing
regulation
in
the
forest
reserves
not
only
to
protect
the
ranges
but
to
preserve
the
soil
from
erosion
similar
action
is
urgently
needed
to
protect
other
public
lands
which
are
now
overgrazed
and
rapidly
eroding
temporary
expedients
though
sometimes
capable
of
appeasing
the
demands
of
the
moment
can
not
permanently
solve
the
surplus
problem
and
might
seriously
aggravate
it
hence
putting
the
government
directly
into
business
subsidies
and
price
fixing
and
the
alluring
promises
of
political
action
as
a
substitute
for
private
initiative
should
be
avoided
the
government
should
aid
in
promoting
orderly
marketing
and
in
handling
surpluses
clearly
due
to
weather
and
seasonal
conditions
as
a
beginning
there
should
be
created
a
federal
farm
board
consisting
of
able
and
experienced
men
empowered
to
advise
producers
associations
in
establishing
central
agencies
or
stabilization
corporations
to
handle
surpluses
to
seek
wore
economical
means
of
merchandising
and
to
aid
the
producer
in
securing
returns
according
to
the
a
of
his
product
a
revolving
loan
fund
should
be
provided
for
the
necessary
financing
until
these
agencies
shall
have
developed
means
of
financing
their
operations
through
regularly
constituted
credit
institutions
such
a
bill
should
carry
authority
for
raising
the
money
by
loans
or
otherwise
necessary
to
meet
the
expense
as
the
treasury
has
no
surplus
agriculture
has
lagged
behind
industry
in
achieving
that
unity
of
effort
which
modern
economic
life
demands
the
cooperative
movement
which
is
gradually
building
the
needed
organization
is
in
harmony
with
public
interest
and
therefore
merits
public
encouragement
the
responsibility
of
the
states
important
phases
of
public
policy
related
to
agriculture
lie
within
the
sphere
of
the
states
while
successive
reductions
in
federal
taxes
have
relieved
most
farmers
of
direct
taxes
to
the
national
government
state
and
local
levies
have
become
a
serious
burden
this
problem
needs
immediate
and
thorough
study
with
a
view
to
correction
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
it
will
have
to
be
made
largely
by
the
states
themselves
commerce
it
is
desirable
that
the
government
continue
its
helpful
attitude
toward
american
business
the
activities
of
the
department
of
commerce
have
contributed
largely
to
the
present
satisfactory
position
in
our
international
trade
which
has
reached
about
annually
there
should
be
no
slackening
of
effort
in
that
direction
it
is
also
important
that
the
departments
assistance
to
domestic
commerce
be
continued
there
is
probably
no
way
in
which
the
government
can
aid
sound
economic
progress
more
effectively
than
by
cooperation
with
our
business
men
to
reduce
wastes
in
distribution
commercial
aeronautics
continued
progress
in
civil
aviation
is
most
gratifying
demands
for
airplanes
and
motors
have
taxed
both
the
industry
and
the
licensing
and
inspection
service
of
the
department
of
commerce
to
their
capacity
while
the
compulsory
licensing
provisions
of
the
air
commerce
act
apply
only
to
equipment
and
personnel
engaged
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
a
federal
license
may
be
procured
by
anyone
possessing
the
necessary
qualifications
state
legislation
local
airport
regulations
and
insurance
requirements
make
such
a
license
practically
indispensable
this
results
in
uniformity
of
regulation
and
increased
safety
in
operation
which
are
essential
to
aeronautical
development
over
young
men
and

now
applied

of
them
applied
during
the
past
year
our
national

system
exceeds
miles
in

and
has
miles
lighted
for

provision
has
been
made
for
lighting
miles
more
during
the
current
fiscal
year
and
equipping
an
equal

threequarters
of
our
people
are
now
served
by
these

with
the
rapid
growth
of

mail
express
and
passenger
service
this
new
transportation
medium
is
daily
becoming
a
more
important
factor
in
commerce
it
is
noteworthy
that
this
development
has
taken
place
without
governmental
subsidies
commercial
passenger
flights
operating
on

have
reached
miles

will
entertain

the
credit
for
this
epochmaking
achievement
belongs
to
a
citizen

wright
cuban

i
desire
to
repeat
my
recommendation
of
an
earlier
message
that
congress
enact
the
legislation
necessary
to
make
permanent
the
parcel
post
convention
with
cuba
both
as
a
facility
to
american
commerce
and
as
a
measure
of
equity
to
cuba
in
the
one
class
of
goods
which
that
country
can
send
here
by
parcel
post
without
detriment
to
our
own
trade
maine
battleship
memorial
when
i
attended
the
pan
american
conference
at
habana
the
president
of
cuba
showed
me
a
marble
statue
made
from
the
original
memorial
that
was
overturned
by
a
storm
after
it
was
erected
on
the
cuban
shore
to
the
memory
of
the
men
who
perished
in
the
destruction
of
the
battleship
maine
as
a
testimony
of
friendship
and
appreciation
of
the
cuban
government
and
people
he
most
generously
offered
to
present
this
to
the
united
states
and
i
assured
him
of
my
pleasure
in
accepting
it
there
is
no
location
in
the
white
house
for
placing
so
large
and
heavy
a
structure
and
i
therefore
urge
the
congress
to
provide
by
law
for
some
locality
where
it
can
be
set
up
railroads
in
previous
annual
messages
i
have
suggested
the
enactment
of
laws
to
promote
railroad
consolidation
with
the
view
of
increasing
the
efficiency
of
transportation
and
lessening
its
cost
to
the
public
while
consolidations
can
and
should
be
made
under
the
present
law
until
it
is
changed
vet
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
have
not
been
found
fully
adequate
to
meet
the
needs
of
other
methods
of
consolidation
amendments
designed
to
remedy
these
defects
have
been
considered
at
length
by
the
respective
committees
of
congress
and
a
bill
was
reported
out
late
in
the
last
session
which
i
understand
has
the
approval
in
principle
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
legislation
may
be
enacted
at
an
early
date
experience
has
shown
that
the
interstate
commerce
law
requires
definition
and
clarification
in
several
other
respects
some
of
which
have
been
pointed
out
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
annual
reports
to
the
congress
it
will
promote
the
public
interest
to
have
the
congress
give
early
consideration
to
the
recommendations
there
made
merchant
marine
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
united
states
government
merchant
fleet
has
been
steadily
reduced
we
have
established
american
flag
lines
in
foreign
trade
where
they
had
never
before
existed
as
a
means
of
promoting
commerce
and
as
a
naval
auxiliary
there
have
been
sold
to
private
american
capital
for
operation
within
the
past
few
years
of
these
lines
which
under
the
encouragement
of
the
recent
legislation
passed
by
the
congress
give
promise
of
continued
successful
operation
additional
legislation
from
time
to
time
may
be
necessary
to
promote
future
advancement
under
private
control
through
the
cooperation
of
the
post
office
department
and
the
shipping
board
longterm
contracts
are
being
made
with
american
steamship
lines
for
carrying
mail
which
already
promise
the
construction
of
to
new
vessels
and
the
gradual
reestablishment
of
the
american
merchant
marine
as
a
private
enterprise
no
action
of
the
national
government
has
been
so
beneficial
to
our
shipping
the
cost
is
being
absorbed
to
a
considerable
extent
by
the
disposal
of
unprofitable
lines
operated
by
the
shipping
board
for
which
the
new
law
has
made
a
market
meanwhile
it
should
be
our
policy
to
maintain
necessary
strategic
lines
under
the
government
operation
until
they
can
be
transferred
to
private
capital
interamerican
highway
in
my
message
last
year
i
expressed
the
view
that
we
should
lend
our
encouragement
for
more
good
roads
to
all
the
principal
points
on
this
hemisphere
south
of
the
rio
grande
my
view
has
not
changed
the
pan
american
union
has
recently
indorsed
it
in
some
of
the
countries
to
the
south
a
great
deal
of
progress
is
being
made
in
road
building
in
others
engineering
features
are
often
exacting
and
financing
difficult
as
those
countries
enter
upon
programs
for
road
building
we
should
be
ready
to
contribute
from
our
abundant
experience
to
make
their
task
easier
of
accomplishment
i
prefer
not
to
go
into
civil
life
to
accomplish
this
end
we
already
furnish
military
and
naval
advisors
and
following
this
precedent
we
could
draw
competent
men
from
these
same
sources
and
from
the
department
of
agriculture
we
should
provide
our
southern
neighbors
if
they
request
it
with
such
engineer
advisors
for
the
construction
of
roads
and
bridges
private
interests
should
look
with
favor
upon
all
reasonable
loans
sought
by
these
countries
to
open
main
lines
of
travel
such
assistance
should
be
given
especially
to
any
project
for
a
highway
designed
to
connect
all
the
countries
on
this
hemisphere
and
thus
facilitate
intercourse
and
closer
relations
among
them

the
friendly
relations
and
the
extensive
commercial
intercourse
with
the
western
hemisphere
to
the
south
of

are
being
further
cemented
by
the
establishment
and
extension

we
shall
soon
have

there
will
be

canal
zone
where
connection
will
be
made
with
a
route
across
the
northern

this
will
give

irrigation
of
arid
lands
for
many
years
the
federal
government
has
been
committed
to
the
wise
policy
of
reclamation
and
irrigation
while
it
has
met
with
some
failures
due
to
unwise
selection
of
projects
and
lack
of
thorough
soil
surveys
so
that
they
could
not
be
placed
on
a
sound
business
basis
on
the
whole
the
service
has
been
of
such
incalculable
benefit
in
so
many
states
that
no
one
would
advocate
its
abandonment
the
program
to
which
we
are
already
committed
providing
for
the
construction
of
new
projects
authorized
by
congress
and
the
completion
of
old
projects
will
tax
the
resources
of
the
reclamation
fund
over
a
period
of
years
the
high
cost
of
improving
and
equipping
farms
adds
to
the
difficulty
of
securing
settlers
for
vacant
farms
on
federal
projects
readjustments
authorized
by
the

relief
act
of
may
have
given
more
favorable
terms
of

to

these
new
financial
arrangements
and
the
general
prosperity
on
irrigation
projects
have
resulted
in
increased
collections
by
the
department
of
the
interior
of
charges
due
the
reclamation
fund
nevertheless
the
demand
for
still
smaller
yearly
payments
on
some
projects
continues
these
conditions
should
have
consideration
in
connection
with
any
proposed
new
projects
colorado
river
for
several
years
the
congress
has
considered
the
erection
of
a
dam
on
the
colorado
river
for
floodcontrol
irrigation
and
domestic
water
purposes
all
of
which
ma
properly
be
considered
as
government
functions
there
would
be
an
incidental
creation
of
water
power
which
could
be
used
for
generating
electricity
as
private
enterprise
can
very
well
fill
this
field
there
is
no
need
for
the
government
to
go
into
it
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
states
interested
in
this
water
have
been
unable
to
agree
among
themselves
nevertheless
any
legislation
should
give
every
possible
safeguard
to
the
present
and
prospective
rights
of
each
of
them
the
congress
will
have
before
it
the
detailed
report
of
a
special
board
appointed
to
consider
the
engineering
and
economic
feasibility
of
this
project
from
the
short
summary
which
i
have
seen
of
it
judge
they
consider
the
engineering
problems
can
be
met
at
somewhat
increased
cost
over
previous
estimates
they
prefer
the
black
canyon
site
on
the
economic
features
they
are
not
so
clear
and
appear
to
base
their
conclusions
on
many
conditions
which
can
not
be
established
with
certainty
so
far
as
i
can
judge
however
from
the
summary
their
conclusions
appear
sufficiently
favorable
so
that
i
feel
warranted
in
recommending
a
measure
which
will
protect
the
rights
of
the
states
discharge
the
necessary
government
functions
and
leave
the
electrical
field
to
private
enterprise
muscle
shoals
the
development
of
other
methods
of
producing
nitrates
will
probably
render
this
plant
less
important
for
that
purpose
than
formerly
but
we
have
it
and
i
am
told
it
still
provides
a
practical
method
of
making
nitrates
for
national
defense
and
farm
fertilizers
by
dividing
the
property
into
its
two
component
parts
of
power
and
nitrate
plants
it
would
be
possible
to
dispose
of
the
power
reserving
the
right
to
any
concern
that
wished
to
make
nitrates
to
use
any
power
that
might
be
needed
for
that
purpose
such
a
disposition
of
the
power
plant
can
be
made
that
will
return
in
rental
about
per
year
if
the
congress
would
giant
the
secretary
of
war
authority
to
lease
the
nitrate
plant
on
such
terms
as
would
insure
the
largest
production
of
nitrates
the
entire
property
could
begin
to
function
such
a
division
i
am
aware
has
never
seemed
to
appeal
to
the
congress
i
should
also
gladly
approve
a
bill
granting
authority
to
lease
the
entire
property
for
the
production
of
nitrates
i
wish
to
avoid
building
another
dam
at
public
expense
future
operators
should
provide
for
that
themselves
but
if
they
were
to
be
required
to
repay
the
cost
of
such
dam
with
the
prevailing
commercial
rates
for
interest
this
difficulty
will
be
considerably
lessened
nor
do
i
think
this
property
should
be
made
a
vehicle
for
putting
the
united
states
government
indiscriminately
into
the
private
and
retail
field
of
power
distribution
and
nitrate
sales

practical

of

calls
for
conservation
this
does
not
mean
that
every
resource
should
not
be
developed
to
its
full
degree
but
it
means
that
none
of
them
should
be
wasted
we
have
a
conservation
board
working
on
our
oil
problem
this
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
future
wellbeing
of
our
people
in
this
age
of
oilburning
engines
and
the
general
application
of

to

the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
not
be
compelled
to
lease
oil
lands
of
the
osage
indians
when
the
market
is
depressed
and
the
future
supply
is
in
jeopardy
while
the
area
of
lands
remaining
in
public
ownership
is
small
compared
with
the
vast
area
in
private
ownership
the
natural
resources
of
those
in
public
ownership
are
of
immense
present
and
future
value
this
is
particularly
trite
as
to
minerals
and
water
power
the
proper
bureaus
have
been
classifying
these
resources
to
the
end
that
they
may
be
conserved
appropriate

are
being
submitted
in

for
the
further
prosecution
of
this
important
work
immigration
the
policy
of
restrictive

should
be
maintained
authority
should
be
granted
the
secretary
of

to
give
immediate
preference
to
learned

essential
to

wage
earner
in
its
economic
life
our
country
has
rejected
the
long
accepted
law
of
a
limitation
of
the
wage
fund
which
led
to
pessimism
and
despair
because
it
was
the
doctrine
of
perpetual
poverty
and
has
substituted
for
it
the
american
conception
that
the
only
limit
to
profits
and
wages
is
production
which
is
the
doctrine
of
optimism
and
hope
because
it
leads
to
prosperity
here
and
there
the
councils
of
labor
are
still
darkened
by
the
theory
that
only
by
limiting
individual
production
can
there
be
any
assurance
of
permanent
employment
for
increasing
numbers
but
in
general
management
and
wage
earner
alike
have
become
emancipated
from
this
doom
and
have
entered
a
new
era
in
industrial
thought
which
has
unleashed
the
productive
capacity
of
the
individual
worker
with
an
increasing
scale
of
wages
and
profits
the
end
of
which
is
not
yet
the
application
of
this
theory
accounts
for
our
widening
distribution
of
wealth
no
discovery
ever
did
more
to
increase
the
happiness
and
prosperity
of
the
people
since
increasing
production
has
increased
wages
in
general
per
cent
while
in
certain
selected
trades
they
have
run
as
high
as
per
cent
and
per
cent
even
in
the
boot
and
shoe
shops
the
increase
is
over
per
cent
and
in
woolen
mills
per
cent
although
these
industries
have
not
prospered
like
others
as
the
rise
in
living
costs
in
this
period
is
negligible
these
figures
represent
real
wage
increases
the
cause
of
constructive
economy
requires
that
the
government
should
cooperate
with
private
interests
to
eliminate
the
waste
arising
from
industrial
accidents
this
item
with
all
that
has
been
done
to
reduce
it
still
reaches
enormous
proportions
with
great
suffering
to
the
workman
and
great
loss
to
the
country
women
and

the
federal
government
should
continue
its
solicitous
care
for
the
women
wage
earners
and
its
efforts
in

of

health
which
is
reducing
infant

bodily
and

condition
of
our
citizens
civil
service
the
most
marked
change
made
in
the
civil
service
of
the
government
in
the
past
eight
years
relates
to
the
increase
in
salaries
the
board
of
actuaries
on
the
retirement
act
shows
by
its
report
that
july
the
average
salary
of
the
employees
subject
to
the
act
was
while
on
june
the
average
salary
of
the
corresponding
was
this
was
an
increase
in
six
years
of
nearly
per
cent
on
top
of
this
was
the
generous
increase
made
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
generally
applicable
to
federal
employees
and
another
bill
increasing
the
pay
in
certain
branches
of
the
postal
service
beyond
the
large
increase
which
was
made
three
years
ago
this
raised
the
average
level
from
to
making
an
increase
in
seven
years
of
over
per
cent
while
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
upper
brackets
the
pay
in
the
federal
service
is
much
smaller
than
in
private
employment
in
the
lower
brackets
ranging
well
up
over
it
is
much
higher
it
is
higher
not
only
in
actual
money
paid
but
in
privileges
granted
a
vacation
of
actual
working
days
or
weeks
each
year
with
additional
time
running
in
some
departments
as
high
as
days
for
sick

and
the
generous
provisions
of

act
no
other
body
of
public

ever

occupied
such
a
fortunate
position

through
the
bureau
of

of
the
department
of

the
federal
government
acting
in
an
informative
and
advisory
capacity
has
rendered
valuable
service
while
this
province
belongs
peculiarly
to
the
states
yet
the
promotion
of
education
and
efficiency
in
educational
methods
is
a
general
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
a
survey
of
negro
colleges
and
universities
in
the

has
just
been
completed
by
the
bureau
of

through
funds
provided
by
the
institutions
themselves
and
through
private
sources
the
present
status
of
negro
higher
education
was
determined
and
recommendations
were
made
for
its
advancement
this
was
one
of
the
numerous
cooperative
undertakings
of

following

is
to

of

it
is
now
proposed
to

for
all
this
work
are
being
prepared
in
order
that
it
may
be
carried
forward
as

this
is
the
greatest

program
ever
assumed
by
this

it
contemplates
structures
of
utility
and
of
beauty
when
it
reaches
completion
the
people
will
be
well
served
and
the

will
be

funds
provided
by

the

existing

should
be
extended

has
been
acknowledged
by
annual
increases
in

to
fulfill
its
obligations
to
them
and
to
hasten
the
time
when
federal

of

may
be
properly
and
safely
terminated
the
movement
in

and
in
some
of
the
state

for
extending

in

be
encouraged

the

desired
the

for
years
now
our
negro
population
has
been
under
the
peculiar
care
and
solicitude
of
the
national
government
the
progress
which
they
have
made
in
education
and
the
professions
in
wealth
and
in
the
arts
of
civilization
affords
one
of
the
most
remarkable
incidents
in
this
period
of
world
history
they
have
demonstrated
their
ability
to
partake
of
the
advantages
of
our
institutions
and
to
benefit
by
a
free
and
more
and
more
independent
existence
whatever
doubt
there
may
have
been
of
their
capacity
to
assume
the
status
granted
to
them
by
the
constitution
of
this
union
is
being
rapidly
dissipated
their
cooperation
in
the
life
of
the
nation
is
constantly
enlarging
exploiting
the
negro
problem
for
political
ends
is
being
abandoned
and
their
protection
is
being
increased
by
those
states
in
which
their
percentage
of

is
largest
every
encouragement
should
be
extended
for

development
of

have
been
the
victims
of
the
crime

which
has
in
late
years
somewhat
decreased
some
parts
of
the

already
have
wholesome

for

their
example
might
well
be
followed
by

can
extend

the

largely
look

the
coffee

will
need
some
assistance
which
should
be
extended

on

basis
and
only
after
most
careful
investigation
the

department
of

it
is
desirable
that
all
the
legal
activities
of
the
government
be
consolidated
under
the
supervision
of
the
attorney
general
in
it
was
felt
necessary
to
create
the
department
of
justice
for
this
purpose
during
the
intervening
period
either
through
legislation
creating
law
officers
or
departmental
action
additional
legal
positions
not
under
the
supervision
of
the
attorney
general
have
been
provided
until
there
are
now
over
such
a
condition
is
as
harmful
to
the
interest
of
the
government
now
as
it
was
in
and
should
be
corrected
by
appropriate
legislation
special
government
counsel
in

to
prosecute
the

cases
i
suggested
and
the
congress
enacted

they
have
pursued
their
work
with
signal
ability
recovering
all
the
leased
lands
besides
nearly
in
money
and
nearly
in
other
property
they
find
themselves
hampered
by
a
statute
which
the
attorney
general
construes
as
applying
to
them
prohibiting
their
appearing
for
private
clients
before
any
department
for
this
reason
one
has
been
compelled
to
resign
no
good
result
is
secured
by
the
application
of
this
rule
to
these
counsel
and
as
mr
roberts
has
consented
to
take
reappointment
if
the
rule
is
abrogated
i
recommend
the
passage
of
an
amendment
to
the
law
creating
their
office
exempting
them
from
the
general
rule
against
taking
other

the

has
duly
adopted
the

amendment
those
who
object
to
it
have
the
right
to
advocate
its
modification
or
repeal
meantime
it
is
binding
upon
the
national
and
state
governments
and
all
our
inhabitants
the
federal
enforcement
bureau
is
making
every
effort
to
prevent
violations
especially
through
smuggling
manufacture
and
transportation
and
to
prosecute
generally
all
violations
for
which
it
can
secure
evidence
it
is
bound
to
continue
this
policy
under
the
terms
of
the

however
the
obligation
is
equally
on
the

to
exercise
the
power
which
they
have
through
the
executive
legislative
judicial
and
police

the

and
will
continue
to
do
all
it
can
in
this
direction
and
is
entitled
to
the
active
cooperation
of

conclusion
the
country
is
in
the
midst
of
an
era
of
prosperity
more
extensive
and
of
peace
more
permanent
than
it
has
ever
before
experienced
but
having
reached
this
position
we
should
not
fail
to
comprehend
that
it
can
easily
be
lost
it
needs
more
effort
for
its
support
than
the
less
exalted
places
of
the
world
we
shall
not
be
permitted
to
take
our
case
but
shall
continue
to
be
required
to
spend
our
days
in
unremitting
toil
the
actions
of
the
government
must
command
the
confidence
of
the
country
without
this
our
prosperity
would
be
lost
we
must
extend
to
other
countries
the
largest
measure
of
generosity
moderation
and
patience
in
addition
to
dealing
justly
we
can
well
afford
to
walk
humbly
the
end
of
government
is
to
keep
open
the
opportunity
for
a
more
abundant
life
peace
and
prosperity
are
not
finalities
they
are
only
methods
it
is
too
easy
under
their
influence
for
a
nation
to
become
selfish
and
degenerate
this
test
has
come
to
the
united
states
our
country
has
been
provided
with
the
resources
with
which
it
can
enlarge
its
intellectual
moral
and
spiritual
life
the
issue
is
in
the
hands
of
the
people
our
faith
in
man
and
god
is
the
justification
for
the
belief
in
our
continuing
success

members
of

it
is
gratifying
to
report
that
for
the
fourth
consecutive
year
the
state
of
the

in
general
is
good
we
are
at
peace
the
country
as
a
whole
has
had
a
prosperity
never
exceeded
wages
are
at
their
highest
range
employment
is
plentiful
some
parts
of
agriculture
and
industry
have
lagged
some
localities
have
suffered
from
storm
and
flood
but
such
losses
have
been
absorbed
without
serious
detriment
to
our
great
economic
structure
stocks
of

are
moderate
and
a
wholesome
caution
is
prevalent
rates
of

agriculture
and

have
been
reduced
savers
and
investors
are
providing
capital
for
new
construction
in

and
public
works
the
purchasing
power
of
agriculture
has
increased
if
the
people
maintain
that
confidence
which
they
are
entitled
to
have
in
themselves
in
each
other
and
in
america
a
comfortable
prosperity
will
continue
constructive
economy
without
constructive
economy
in
government
expenditures
we
should
not
now
be
enjoying
these
results
or
these
prospects
because
we
are
not
now
physically
at
war
some
people
are
disposed
to
forget
that
our
war
debt
still
remains
the
nation
must
make
financial
sacrifices
accompanied
by
a
stern
selfdenial
in
public
expenditures
until
we
have
conquered
the
disabilities
of
our
public
finance
while
our
obligation
to
veterans
and
dependents
is
large
and
continuing
the
heavier
burden
of
the
national
debt
is
being
steadily
eliminated
at
the
end
of
this
fiscal
year
it
will
be
reduced
from
about
to
about
annual
interest
including
war
savings
will
have
been
reduced
from
to
the
sacrifices
of
the
people
the
economy
of
the
government
are
showing
remarkable
results
they
should
be
continued
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
the
nation
of
the
burden
of
interest
and
debt
and
releasing
revenue
for
internal
improvements
and
national
development
not
only
the
amount
but
the
rate
of
government
interest
has
been
reduced
callable
bonds
have
been
refunded
and
paid
so
that
during
this
year
the
average
rate
of
interest
on
the
present
public
debt
for
the
first
time
fell
below
per
cent
keeping
the
credit
of
the
nation
high
is
a
tremendously
profitable
operation
tax
reduction
the
immediate
fruit
of

and
the
retirement
of
the
public

is
tax
reduction
the
annual
saving
in
interest
between
and
is
without
this
no
bill
to
relieve
the
taxpayers
would
be
worth
proposing
the
three
measures
already
enacted
leave
our
government
revenues
where
they
are
not
oppressive
exemptions
have
been
increased
until
people
make
but
individual
taxable
returns
so
that
further
reduction
should
be
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
removing
inequalities
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
recommended
a
measure
which
would
give
us
a
much
better
balanced
system
of
taxation
and
without
oppression
produce
sufficient
revenue
it
has
my
complete
support
unforeseen
contingencies
requiring
money
are
always
arising
our
probable
surplus
for
june
is
small
a
slight
depression
in
business
would
greatly
reduce
our
revenue
because
of
our
present
method
of
taxation
the
people
ought
to
take
no
selfish
attitude
of
pressing
for
removing
moderate
and
fair
taxes
which
might
produce
a
deficit
we
must
keep
our
budget
balanced
for
each
year
that
is
the
corner
stone
of
our
national
credit
the
trifling
price
we
pay
to
command
the
lowest
rate
of
interest
of
any
great
power
in
the
world
any
surplus
can
be
applied
to
debt
reduction
and
debt
reduction
is
tax
reduction
under
the
present
circumstances
it
would
be
far
better
to
leave
the
rates
as
they
are
than
to
enact
a
bill
carrying
the
peril
of
a
deficit
this
is
not
a
problem
to
be
approached
in
a
narrow
or
partisan
spirit
all
of
those
who
participate
in
finding
a
reasonable
solution
will
be
entitled
to
participate
in
any
credit
that
accrues
from
it
without
regard
to
party
the
congress
has
already
demonstrated
that
tax
legislation
can
be
removed
from
purely
political
consideration
into
the
realm
of
patriotic
business
principles
any
bill
for
tax
reduction
should
be
written
by
those
who
are
responsible
for
raising
managing
and
expending
the
finances
of
the
government
if
special
interests
too
often
selfish
always
uninformed
of
the
national
needs
as
a
whole
with
hired
agents
using
their
proposed
beneficiaries
as
engines
of
propaganda
are
permitted
to
influence
the
withdrawal
of
their
property
from
taxation
we
shall
have
a
law
that
is
unbalanced
and
unjust
bad
for
business
bad
for
the
country
probably
resulting
in
a
deficit
with
disastrous
financial
consequences
the
constitution
has
given
the
members
of
the
congress
sole
authority
to
decide
what
tax
measures
shall
be
presented
for
approval
while
welcoming
information
from
any
quarter
the
congress
should
continue
to
exercise
its
own
judgment
in
a
matter
so
vital
and
important
to
all
the
interests
of
the
country
as
taxation
national
defense
being
a
nation
relying
not
on
force
but
on
fair
dealing
and
good
will
to
maintain
peace
with
others
we
have
provided
a
moderate
military
force
in
a
form
adapted
solely
to
defense
it
should
be
continued
with
a
very
generous
supply
of
officers
and
with
the
present
base
of
personnel
subject
to
fluctuations
which
may
be
temporarily
desirable
the
fiveyear
program
for
our
air
forces
is
in
keeping
with
this
same
policy
and
commensurate
with
the
notable
contributions
of
america
to
the
science
of
aeronautics
the
provisions
of
the
law
lately
enacted
are
being
executed
as
fast
as
the
practical
difficulties
of
an
orderly
and
stable
development
permit
while
our
army
is
small
prudence
requires
that
it
should
be
kept
in
a
high
state
of
efficiency
and
provided
with
such
supplies
as
would
permit
of
its
immediate
expansion
the
garrison
ration
has
lately
been
increased
recommendations
for
an
appropriation
of
for
new
housing
made
to
the
previous
congress
failed
to
pass
while
most
of
the
army
is
well
housed
some
of
it
which
is
quartered
in
wartime
training
camps
is
becoming
poorly
housed
in
the
past
three
years
have
been
appropriated
for
reconstruction
and
repairs
and
an
authorization
has
been
approved
of
for
new
housing
under
which
has
already
been
appropriated
a
law
has
also
been
passed
complying
with
the
request
of
the
war
department
allocating
funds
received
from
the
sale
of
buildings
and
land
for
housing
purposes
the
work
however
is
not
completed
so
that
other
appropriations
are
being
recommended
our
navy
is
likewise
a
weapon
of
defense
we
have
a
foreign
commerce
and
ocean
lines
of
trade
unsurpassed
by
any
other
country
we
have
outlying
territory
in
the
two
great
oceans
and
long
stretches
of
seacoast
studded
with
the
richest
cities
in
the
world
we
are
responsible
for
the
protection
of
a
large
population
and
the
greatest
treasure
ever
bestowed
upon
any
people
we
are
charged
with
an
international
duty
of
defending
the
panama
canal
to
meet
these
responsibilities
we
need
a
very
substantial
sea
armament
it
needs
aircraft
development
which
is
being
provided
under
the
fiveyear
program
it
needs
submarines
as
soon
as
the
department
decides
upon
the
best
type
of
construction
it
needs
airplane
carriers
and
a
material
addition
to
its
force
of
cruisers
we
can
plan
for
the
future
and
begin
a
moderate
building
program
this
country
has
put
away
the
old
world
policy
of
competitive
armaments
it
can
never
be
relieved
of
the
responsibility
of
adequate
national
defense
we
have
one
treaty
secured
by
an
unprecedented
attitude
of
generosity
on
our
part
for
a
limitation
in
naval
armament
after
most
careful
preparation
extending
over
months
we
recently
made
every
effort
to
secure
a
threepower
treaty
to
the
same
end
we
were
granted
much
cooperation
by
japan
but
we
were
unable
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
great
britain
while
the
results
of
the
conference
were
of
considerable
value
they
were
mostly
of
a
negative
character
we
know
now
that
no
agreement
can
be
reached
which
will
be
inconsistent
with
a
considerable
building
program
on
our
part
we
are
ready
and
willing
to
continue
the
preparatory
investigations
on
the
general
subject
of
limitation
of
armaments
which
have
been
started
under
the
auspices
of
the
league
of
nations
we
have
a
considerable
cruiser
tonnage
but
a
part
of
it
is
obsolete
everyone
knew
that
had
a
threepower
agreement
been
reached
it
would
have
left
us
with
the
necessity
of
continuing
our
building
program
the
failure
to
agree
should
not
cause
us
to
build
either
more
or
less
than
we
otherwise
should
any
future
treaty
of
limitation
will
call
on
us
for
more
ships
we
should
enter
on
no
competition
we
should
refrain
from
no
needful
program
it
should
be
made
clear
to
all
the
world
that
lacking
a
definite
agreement
the
attitude
of
any
other
country
is
not
to
be
permitted
to
alter
our
own
policy
it
should
especially
be
demonstrated
that
propaganda
will
not
cause
us
to
change
our
course
where
there
is
no
treaty
limitation
the
size
of
the
navy
which
america
is
to
have
will
be
solely
for
america
to
determine
no
outside
influence
should
enlarge
it
or
diminish
it
but
it
should
be
known
to
all
that
our
military
power
holds
no
threat
of
aggrandizement
it
is
a
guaranty
of
peace
and
security
at
home
and
when
it
goes
abroad
it
is
an
instrument
for
the
protection
of
the
legal
rights
of
our
citizens
under
international
law
a
refuge
in
time
of
disorder
and
always
the
servant
of
world
peace

our
flag
goes

of

its
drain
on

the

board
is
constantly
under
pressure
to
which
it
too
often
yields
to
protect
private
interests
rather
than
serve
the
public
welfare
more
attention
should
be
given
to
merchant
ships
as
an
auxiliary
of
the
navy
the
possibility
of
including
their
masters
and
crews
in
the
naval
reserve
with
some
reasonable
compensation
should
be
thoroughly
explored
as
a
method
of
encouraging
private
operation
of

public

is
not
a
success
no

to
be
made
has
failed
to
report
that
it
could
not
succeed
or
to

recommend
speedy
transfer
to
private
ownership
our
exporters
and
importers
are
both
indifferent
about
using
american
ships
it
should
be
our
policy
to
keep
our
present
vessels
in
repair
and
dispose
of
them
as
rapidly
as
possible
rather
than
undertake
any
new
construction
their
operation
is
a
burden
on
the
national

for
which
we
are
not
receiving
sufficient
benefits
commercial

a
rapid

is
taking

private

we
are
particularly
solicitous
to
have
the
united

take
a
leading
part
in
this
development
it
is
understood
that
the
governments
of
our
sister
countries
would
be
willing
to
cooperate
their
physical
features
the
undeveloped
state
of
their
transportation
make
an
air
service
especially
adaptable
to
their
usage
the
post
office
department
should
be
granted
power
to
make
liberal
longterm
contracts
for

should
be
given

to
cooperate
with

in
establishing
such

with
the
consent
of
the

concerned
a

will
later
present
a
report
on
this
subject
good

the
importance
and
benefit
of
good
roads
is
more
and
more
coming
to
be
appreciated
the
national
government
has
been
making
liberal
contributions
to
encourage
their
construction
the
results
and
benefits
have
been
very
gratifying
national
participation
however
should
be
confined
to
trunkline
systems
the
national
tax
on
automobiles
is
now
nearly
sufficient
to
meet
this
outlay
this
tax
is
very
small
and
on
lowpriced
cars
is
not
more
than
or
each
year
while
the
advantage
of
having
good
roads
is
very
large
the
desire
for
improved
highways
is
not
limited
to
our
own
country
it
should
and
does
include
all
the
western
hemisphere
the
principal
points
in
canada
are
already
accessible
we
ought
to
lend
our
encouragement
in
any
way
we
can
for
more
good
roads
to
all
the
principal
points
in
this
hemisphere
south
of
the
rio
grande
it
has
been
our
practice
to
supply
these
countries
with
military
and
naval
advisers
when
they
have
requested
it
to
assist
them
in
national
defense
the
arts
of
peace
are
even
more
important
to
them
and
to
us
authority
should
be
given
by
law
to
provide
them
at
their
request
with
engineering
advisers
for
the
construction
of
roads
and
bridges
in
some
of
these
countries
already
wonderful
progress
is
being
made
in
road
building
but
the
engineering
features
are
often
very
exacting
and
the
financing
difficult
private
interests
should
look
with
favor
on
all
reasonable
loans
sought
by
these
countries
to
open
such
main
lines
of
travel
this
general
subject
has
been
promoted
by
the
pan
american
congress
of
highways
which
will
convene
again
at
rio
de
janeiro
in
july
it
is
desirable
that
the
congress
should
provide
for
the
appointment
of
delegates
to
represent
the
government
of
the
united
states
cuban
parcel
post
we
have
a
temporary
parcelpost
convention
with
cuba
the
advantage
of
it
is
all
on
our
side
during
we
shipped
twelve
times
as
many
parcels
weighing
twentyfour
times
as
much
as
we
received
this
convention
was
made
on
the
understanding
that
we
would
repeal
an
old
law
prohibiting
the
importation
of
cigars
and
cigarettes
in
quantities
less
than
enacted
in
to
discourage
smuggling
for
which
it
has
long
been
unnecessary
this
law
unjustly
discriminates
against
an
important
industry
of
cuba
its
repeal
has
been
recommended
by
the
treasury
and
post
office
departments
unless
this
is
done
our
merchants
and
railroads
will
find
themselves
deprived
of
this
large
parcelpost
business
after
the
st
of
next
march
the
date
of
the
expiration
of
the
convention
which
has
been
extended
upon
the
specific
understanding
that
it
would
expire
at
that
time
unless
this
legislation
was
enacted
we
purchase
large
quantities
of
tobacco
made
in
cuba
it
is
not
probable
that
our
purchases
would
be
any
larger
if
this
law
was
repealed
while
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
many
other
industries
in
the
united
states
insular

conditions
in
the
philippine
islands
have
been
steadily
improved

good
order
prevail
roads
irrigation

improvements
and
public
buildings
are
being
constructed
public
education
and

have
been
advanced
the
government
is
in
a
sound
financial
condition
these
immediate
results
were
especially
due
to
the
administration
of
gov
gen
leonard
wood
the
six
years
of
his
governorship
marked
a
distinct
improvement
in
the
islands
and
rank
as
one
of
the
outstanding
accomplishments
of
this
distinguished
man
his
death
is
a
loss
to
the
nation
and
the
islands
greater
progress
could
be
made
more
efficiency
could
be
put
into
administration
if
the
congress
would
undertake
to
expend
through
its
appropriating
power
all
or
a
part
of
the
customs
revenues
which
are
now
turned
over
to
the
philippine
treasury
the
powers
of
the
auditor
of
the
islands
also
need
revision
and
clarification
the
government
of
the
islands
is
about
per
cent
in
the
hands
of
the
filipinos
an
extension
of
the
policy
of
selfgovernment
will
be
hastened
by
the
demonstration
on
their
part
of
their
desire
and
their
ability
to
carry
out
cordially
and
efficiently
the
provisions
of
the
organic
law
enacted
by
the
congress
for
the
government
of
the
islands
it
would
be
well
for
a
committee
of
the
congress
to
visit
the
islands
every
two
years
a
fair
degree
of
progress
is
being
made
in
porto
rico
its
agricultural
products
are
increasing
its
treasury
position
which
has
given
much
concern
shows
improvement
i
am
advised
by
the
governor
that
educational
facilities
are
still
lacking
roads
are
being
constructed
which
he
represents
are
the
first
requisite
for
building
schoolhouses
the
loyalty
of
the
island
to
the
united
states
is
exceedingly
gratifying
a
memorial
will
be
presented
to
you
requesting
authority
to
have
the
governor
elected
by
the
people
of
porto
rico
this
was
never
done
in
the
case
of
our
own
territories
it
is
admitted
that
education
outside
of
the
towns
is
as
yet
very
deficient
until
it
has
progressed
further
the
efficiency
of
the
government
and
the
happiness
of
the
people
may
need
the
guiding
hand
of
an
appointed
governor
as
it
is
not
contemplated
that
any
change
should
be
made
immediately
the
general
subject
may
well
have
the
thoughtful
study
of
the
congress
panama
canal
the
number
of
commercial
ships
passing
through
the
panama
canal
has
increased
from
in
to
in
the
total
amount
of
tolls
turned
into
the
treasury
is
over
while
all
the
operations
of
the
canal
have
yielded
a
surplus
of
about
in
order
to
provide
additional
storage
of
water
and
give
some
control
over
the
floods
of
the
chagres
river
it
is
proposed
to
erect
a
dam
to
cost
about
at
alhajuela
it
will
take
some
five
years
to
complete
this
work
agriculture
the
past
year
has
seen
a
marked
improvement
in
the
general
condition
of
agriculture
production
is
better
balanced
and
without
acute
shortage
or
heavy
surplus
costs
have
been
reduced
and
the
average
output
of
the
worker
increased
the
level
of
farm
prices
has
risen
while
others
have
fallen
so
that
the
purchasing
power
of
the
farmer
is
approaching
a
normal
figure
the
individual
farmer
is
entitled
to
great
credit
for
the
progress
made
since
he
has
adjusted
his
production
and
through
cooperative
organizations
and
other
methods
improved
his
marketing
he
is
using
authenticated
facts
and
employing
sound
methods
which
other
industries
are
obliged
to
use
to
secure
stability
and
prosperity
the
oldfashioned
haphazard
system
is
being
abandoned
economics
are
being
applied
to
ascertain
the
best
adapted
unit
of
land
diversification
is
being
promoted
and
scientific
methods
are
being
used
in
production
and
business
principles
in
marketing
agriculture
has
not
fully
recovered
from
postwar
depression
the
fact
is
that
economic
progress
never
marches
forward
in
a
straight
line
it
goes
in
waves
one
part
goes
ahead
while
another
halts
and
another
recedes
everybody
wishes
agriculture
to
prosper
any
sound
and
workable
proposal
to
help
the
farmer
will
have
the
earnest
support
of
the
government
their
interests
are
not
all
identical
legislation
should
assist
as
many
producers
in
as
many
regions
as
possible
it
should
be
the
aim
to
assist
the
farmer
to
work
out
his
own
salvation
socially
and
economically
no
plan
will
be
of
any
permanent
value
to
him
which
does
not
leave
him
standing
on
his
own
foundation
in
the
past
the
government
has
spent
vast
sums
to
bring
land
under
cultivation
it
is
apparent
that
this
has
reached
temporarily
the
saturation
point
we
have
had
a
surplus
of
production
and
a
poor
market
for
land
which
has
only
lately
shown
signs
of
improvement
the
main
problem
which
is
presented
for
solution
is
one
of
dealing
with
a
surplus
of
production
it
is
useless
to
propose
a
temporary
expedient
what
is
needed
is
permanency
and
stability
government
price
fixing
is
known
to
be
unsound
and
bound
to
result
in
disaster
a
government
subsidy
would
work
out
in
the
same
way
it
can
not
be
sound
for
all
of
the
people
to
hire
some
of
the
people
to
produce
a
crop
which
neither
the
producers
nor
the
rest
of
the
people
want
price
fixing
and
subsidy
will
both
increase
the
surplus
instead
of
diminishing
it
putting
the
government
directly
i
nto
business
is
merely
a
combination
of
subsidy
and
price
fixing
aggravated
by
political
pressure
these
expedients
would
lead
logically
to
telling
the
farmer
by
law
what
and
how
much
he
should
plant
and
where
he
should
plant
it
and
what
and
how
much
he
should
sell
and
where
he
should
sell
it
the
most
effective
means
of
dealing
with
surplus
crops
is
to
reduce
the
surplus
acreage
while
this
can
not
be
done
by
the
individual
farmer
it
can
be
done
through
the
organizations
already
in
existence
through
the
information
published
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
especially
through
banks
and
others
who
supply
credit
refusing
to
finance
an
acreage
manifestly
too
large
it
is
impossible
to
provide
by
law
for
an
assured
success
and
prosperity
for
all
those
who
engage
in
farming
if
acreage
becomes
overextended
the
government
can
not
assume
responsibility
for
it
the
government
can
however
assist
cooperative
associations
and
other
organizations
in
orderly
marketing
and
handling
a
surplus
clearly
due
to
weather
and
seasonal
conditions
in
order
to
save
the
producer
from
preventable
loss
while
it
is
probably
impossible
to
secure
this
result
at
a
single
step
and
much
will
have
to
be
worked
out
by
trial
and
rejection
a
beginning
could
be
made
by
setting
up
a
federal
board
or
commission
of
able
and
experienced
men
in
marketing
granting
equal
advantages
under
this
board
to
the
various
agricultural
commodities
and
sections
of
the
country
giving
encouragement
to
the
cooperative
movement
in
agriculture
and
providing
a
revolving
loan
fund
at
a
moderate
rate
of
interest
for
the
necessary
financing
such
legislation
would
lay
the
foundation
for
a
permanent
solution
of
the
surplus
problem
this
is
not
a
proposal
to
lend
more
money
to
the
farmer
who
is
already
fairly
well
financed
but
to
lend
money
temporarily
to
experimental
marketing
associations
which
will
no
doubt
ultimately
be
financed
by
the
regularly
established
banks
as
were
the
temporary
operations
of
the
war
finance
corporation
cooperative
marketing
especially
would
be
provided
with
means
of
buying
or
building
physical
properties
the
national
government
has
almost
entirely
relieved
the
farmer
from
income
taxes
by
successive
tax
reductions
but
state
and
local
taxes
have
increased
putting
on
him
a
grievous
burden
a
policy
of
rigid
economy
should
be
applied
to
state
and
local
expenditures
this
is
clearly
within
the
legislative
domain
of
the
states
the
federal
government
has
also
improved
our
banking
structure
and
system
of
agricultural
credits
the
farmer
will
be
greatly
benefited
by
similar
action
in
many
states
the
department
of
agriculture
is
undergoing
changes
in
organization
in
order
more
completely
to
separate
the
research
and
regulatory
divisions
that
each
may
be
better
administered
more
emphasis
is
being
placed
on
the
research
program
not
only
by
enlarging
the
appropriations
for
state
experiment
stations
but
by
providing
funds
for
expanding
the
research
work
of
the
department
it
is
in
this
direction
that
much
future
progress
can
be
expected
the
protective
tariff
the
present
tariff
rates
supply
the
national
treasury
with
well
over
of
annual
revenue
yet
about
per
cent
of
our
imports
come
in
duty
free
of
the
remaining
per
cent
of
imports
on
which
duties
are
laid
about
per
cent
consists
of
luxuries
and
agricultural
products
and
the
balance
of
about
per
cent
amounting
to
around
is
made
up
of
manufactures
and
merchandise
as
no
one
is
advocating
any
material
reduction
in
the
rates
on
agriculture
or
luxuries
it
is
only
the
comparatively
small
amount
of
about
of
other
imports
that
are
really
considered
in
any
discussion
of
reducing
tariff
rates
while
this
amount
duty
free
would
be
large
enough
seriously
to
depress
many
lines
of
business
in
our
own
country
it
is
of
small
importance
when
spread
over
the
rest
of
the
world
it
is
often
stated
that
a
reduction
of
tariff
rates
on
industry
would
benefit
agriculture
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
to
what
commodities
it
is
thought
this
could
be
applied
everything
the
farmer
uses
in
farming
is
already
on
the
free
list
nearly
everything
he
sells
is
protected
it
would
seem
to
be
obvious
that
it
is
better
for
the
country
to
have
the
farmer
raise
food
to
supply
the
domestic
manufacturer
than
the
foreign
manufacturer
in
one
case
our
country
would
have
only
the
farmer
in
the
other
it
would
have
the
farmer
and
the
manufacturer
assuming
that
europe
would
have
more
money
if
it
sold
us
larger
amounts
of
merchandise
it
is
not
certain
it
would
consume
more
food
or
if
it
did
that
its
purchases
would
be
made
in
this
country
undoubtedly
it
would
resort
to
the
cheapest
market
which
is
by
no
means
ours
the
largest
and
best
and
most
profitable
market
for
the
farmer
in
the
world
is
our
own
domestic
market
any
great
increase
in
manufactured
imports
means
the
closing
of
our
own
plants
nothing
would
be
worse
for
agriculture
probably
no
one
expects
a
material
reduction
in
the
rates
on
manufactures
while
maintaining
the
rates
on
agriculture
a
material
reduction
in
either
would
be
disastrous
to
the
farmer
it
would
mean
a
general
shrinkage
of
values
a
deflation
of
prices
a
reduction
of
wages
a
general
depression
carrying
our
people
down
to
the
low
standard
of
living
in
our
competing
countries
it
is
obvious
that
this
would
not
improve
but
destroy
our
market
for
imports
which
is
best
served
by
maintaining
our
present
high
purchasing
power
under
which
in
the
past
five
years
imports
have
increased

farm

it
is
exceedingly
important
that
the
federal

should
furnish
the
best

for

certain

have
fallen
into

in
the

of

last
year
has
seen
considerable
changes
in
the
problem

development
of
other
methods
show
that
nitrates
can
probably
be
produced
at
less
cost
than
by
the
use
of
hydroelectric
power
extensive
investigation
made
by
the
department
of
war
indicates
that
the
nitrate
plants
on
this
project
are
of
little
value
for
national
defense
and
can
probably
be
disposed
of
within
two
years
the
oxidation
part
of
the
plants
however
should
be
retained
indefinitely
this
leaves
this
project
mostly
concerned
with
power
it
should
nevertheless
continue
to
be
dedicated
to
agriculture
it
is
probable
that
this
desire
can
be
best
served
by
disposing
of
the
plant
and
applying
the
revenues
received
from
it
to
research
for
methods
of
more
economical
production
of
concentrated
fertilizer
and
to
demonstrations

other
methods
of
stimulating

should
be
given

flood
control
for
many
years
the
federal
government
has
been
building
a
system
of
dikes
along
the
mississippi
river
for
protection
against
high
water
during
the
past
season
the
lower
states
were
overcome
by
a
most
disastrous
flood
many
thousands
of
square
miles
were
inundated
a
great
many
lives
were
lost
much
livestock
was
drowned
and
a
very
heavy
destruction
of
property
was
inflicted
upon
the
inhabitants
the
american
red
cross
at
once
went
to
the
relief
of
the
stricken
communities
appeals
for
contributions
have
brought
in
over
the
federal
government
has
provided
services
equipment
and
supplies
probably
amounting
to
about
more
between
and
in
addition
have
been
provided
by
local
railroads
the
states
and
their
political
units
credits
have
been
arranged
by
the
farm
loan
board
and
three
emergency
finance
corporations
with
a
total
capital
of
have
insured
additional
resources
to
the
extent
of
through
these
means
the
people
in
the
flooded
areas
have
been
adequately
supported
provision
has
been
made
to
care
for
those
in
need
until
after
the
st
of
january
the
engineering
corps
of
the
army
has
contracted
to
close
all
breaks
in
the
dike
system
before
the
next
season
of
high
water
a
most
thorough
and
elaborate
survey
of
the
whole
situation
has
been
made
and
embodied
in
a
report
with
recommendations
for
future
flood
control
which
will
be
presented
to
the
congress
the
carrying
out
of
their
plans
will
necessarily
extend
over
a
series
of
years
they
will
call
for
a
raising
and
strengthening
of
the
dike
system
with
provision
for
emergency
spillways
and
improvements
for
the
benefit
of
navigation
under
the
present
law
the
land
adjacent
to
the
dikes
has
paid
onethird
of
the
cost
of
their
construction
this
has
been
a
most
extraordinary
concession
from
the
plan
adopted
in
relation
to
irrigation
where
the
general
rule
has
been
that
the
land
benefited
should
bear
the
entire
expense
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
troublesome
waters
do
not
originate
on
the
land
to
be
reclaimed
but
it
is
also
true
that
such
waters
have
a
right
of
way
through
that
section
of
the
country
and
the
land
there
is
charged
with
that
easement
it
is
the
land
of
this
region
that
is
to
be
benefited
to
say
that
it
is
unable
to
bear
any
expense
of
reclamation
is
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
it
is
not
worth
reclaiming
because
of
expenses
incurred
and
charges
already
held
against
this
land
it
seems
probable
that
some
revision

will
have
to
be
made
concerning
the
proportion
of
cost
which
it
should
bear
but
it
is
extremely
important
that
it
should
pay
enough
so
that
those
requesting
improvements
will
be
charged
with
some
responsibility
for
their
cost
and
the
neighborhood
where
works
are
constructed
have
a
pecuniary
interest
in
preventing
waste
and
extravagance
and
securing
a
wise
and
economical
expenditure
of
public
funds
it
is
necessary
to
look
upon
this
emergency
as
a
national
disaster
it
has
been
so
treated
from
its
inception
our
whole
people
have
provided
with
great
generosity
for
its
relief
most
of
the
departments
of
the
federal
government
have
been
engaged
in
the
same
effort
the
governments
of
the
afflicted
areas
both
state
and
municipal
can
not
be
given
too
high
praise
for
the
courageous
and
helpful
way
in
which
they
have
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
people
if
the
sources
directly
chargeable
can
not
meet
the
demand
the
national
government
should
not
fail
to
provide
generous
relief
this
however
does
not
mean
restoration
the
government
is
not
an
insurer
of
its
citizens
against
the
hazard
of
the
elements
we
shall
always
have
flood
and
drought
heat
and
cold
earthquake
and
wind
lightning
and
tidal
wave
which
are
all
too
constant
in
their
afflictions
the
government
does
not
undertake
to
reimburse
its
citizens
for
loss
and
damage
incurred
under
such
circumstances
it
is
chargeable
however
with
the
rebuilding
of
public
works
and
the
humanitarian
duty
of
relieving
its
citizens
from
distress
the
people
in
the
flooded
area
and
their
representatives
have
approached
this
problem
in
the
most
generous
and
broadminded
way
they
should
be
met
with
a
like
spirit
on
the
part
of
the
national
government
this
is
all
one
country
the
public
needs
of
each
part
must
be
provided
for
by
the
public
at
large
no
required
relief
should
be
refused
an
adequate
plan
should
be
adopted
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
this
disaster
in
order
that
the
people
may
restore
to
productivity
and
comfort
their
fields
and
their
towns
legislation
by
this
congress
should
be
confined
to
our
principal
and
most
pressing
problem
the
lower
mississippi
considering
tributaries
only
so
far
as
they
materially
affect
the
main
flood
problem
a
definite
federal
program
relating
to
our
waterways
was
proposed
when
the
last
congress
authorized
a
comprehensive
survey
of
all
the
important
streams
of
the
country
in
order
to
provide
for
their
improvement
including
flood
control
navigation
power
and
irrigation
other
legislation
should
wait
pending
a
report
on
this
survey
the
recognized
needs
of
the
mississippi
should
not
be
made
a
vehicle
for
carrying
other
projects
all
proposals
for
development
should
stand
on
their
own
merits
any
other
method
would
result
in
illadvised
conclusions
great
waste
of
money
and
instead
of
promoting
would
delay
the
orderly
and
certain
utilization
of
our
water
resources
very
recently
several
of
the
new
england
states
have
suffered
somewhat
similarly
from
heavy
rainfall
and
high
water
no
reliable
estimate
of
damage
has
yet
been
computed
but
it
is
very
large
to
private
and
public
property
the
red
cross
is
generously
undertaking
what
is
needed
for
immediate
relief
repair
and
reconstruction
of
houses
restocking
of
domestic
animals
and
food
clothing
and
shelter
a
considerable
sum
of
money
will
be
available
through
the
regular
channels
in
the
department
of
agriculture
for
reconstruction
of
highways
it
may
be
necessary
to
grant
special
aid
for
this
purpose
complete
reports
of
what
is
required
will
undoubtedly
be
available
early
in
the
session
inland
navigation
the
congress
in
its
last
session
authorized
the
general
improvements
necessary
to
provide
the
mississippi
waterway
system
with
better
transportation
stabilization
of
the
levels
of
the
great
lakes
and
their
opening
to
the
sea
by
an
effective
shipway
remain
to
be
considered
since
the
last
session
the
board
of
engineers
of
the
war
department
has
made
a
report
on
the
proposal
for
a
canal
through
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
joint
board
of
engineers
representing
canada
and
the
united
states
has
finished
a
report
on
the
st
lawrence
river
both
of
these
boards
conclude
that
the
st
lawrence
project
is
cheaper
affords
a
more
expeditious
method
of
placing
western
products
in
european
markets
and
will
cost
less
to
operate
the
state
department
has
requested
the
canadian
government
to
negotiate
treaties
necessary
to
provide
for
this
improvement
it
will
also
be
necessary
to
secure
an
agreement
with
canada
to
put
in
works
necessary
to
prevent
fluctuation
in
the
levels
of
the
great
lakes
legislation
is
desirable
for
the
construction
of
a
dam
at
boulder
canyon
on
the
colorado
river
primarily
as
a
method
of
flood
control
and
irrigation
a
secondary
result
would
be
a
considerable
power
development
and
a
source
of
domestic
water
supply
for
southern
california
flood
control
is
clearly
a
national
problem
and
water
supply
is
a
government
problem
but
every
other
possibility
should
be
exhausted
before
the
federal
government
becomes
engaged
in
the
power
business
the
states
which
are
interested
ought
to
reach
mutual
agreement
this
project
is
in
reality
their
work
if
they
wish
the
federal
government
to
undertake
it
they
should
not
hesitate
to
make
the
necessary
concessions
to
each
other
this
subject
is
fully
discussed
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
columbia
river
basin
project
is
being
studied
and
will
be
one
to
be
considered
at
some
future
time
the
inland
waterways
corporation
is
proving
successful
and
especially
beneficial
to
agriculture
a
survey
is
being
made
to
determine
its
future
needs
it
has
never
been
contemplated
that
if
inland
rivers
were
opened
to
navigation
it
would
then
be
necessary
for
the
federal
government
to
provide
the
navigation
such
a
request
is
very
nearly
the
equivalent
of
a
declaration
that
their
navigation
is
not
profitable
that
the
commodities
which
they
are
to
carry
can
be
taken
at
a
cheaper
rate
by
some
other
method
in
which
case
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
proposed
to
be
expended
for
opening
rivers
to
navigation
would
be
not
only
wasted
but
would
entail
further
constant
expenditures
to
carry
the
commodities
of
private
persons
for
less
than
cost
the
policy
is
well
established
that
the
government
should
open
public
highways
on
land
and
on
water
but
for
use
of
the
public
in
their
private
capacity
it
has
put
on
some
demonstration
barge
lines
but
always
with
the
expectation
that
if
they
prove
profitable
they
would
pass
into
private
hands
and
if
they
do
not
prove
profitable
they
will
be
withdrawn
the
problems
of
transportation
over
inland
waterways
should
be
taken
up
by
private
enterprise
so
that
the
public
will
have
the
advantage
of
competition
in
service
it
is
expected
that
some
of
our
lines
can
be
sold
some
more
demonstration
work
done
and
that
with
the
completion
of
the
ohio
project
a
policy
of
private
operation
can
be
fully
developed
prohibition
after
more
than
two
generations
of
constant
debate
our
country
adopted
a
system
of
national
prohibition
under
all
the
solemnities
involved
in
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
in
obedience
to
this
mandate
the
congress
and
the
states
with
one
or
two
notable
exceptions
have
passed
required
laws
for
its
administration
and
enforcement
this
imposes
upon
the
citizenship
of
the
country
and
especially
on
all
public
officers
not
only
the
duty
to
enforce
but
the
obligation
to
observe
the
sanctions
of
this
constitutional
provision
and
its
resulting
laws
if
this
condition
could
be
secured
all
question
concerning
prohibition
would
cease
the
federal
government
is
making
every
effort
to
accomplish
these
results
through
careful
organization
large
appropriations
and
administrative
effort
smuggling
has
been
greatly
cut
down
the
larger
sources
of
supply
for
illegal
sale
have
been
checked
and
by
means
of
injunction
and
criminal
prosecution
the
process
of
enforcement
is
being
applied
the
same
vigilance
on
the
part
of
local
governments
would
render
these
efforts
much
more
successful
the
federal
authorities
propose
to
discharge
their
obligation
for
enforcement
to
the
full
extent
of
their
ability
the
negro
history
does
not
anywhere
record
so
much
progress
made
in
the
same
length
of
time
as
that
which
has
been
accomplished
by
the
negro
race
in
the
united
states
since
the
emancipation
proclamation
they
have
come
up
from
slavery
to
be
prominent
in
education
the
professions
art
science
agriculture
banking
and
commerce
it
is
estimated
that
of
them
are
on
the
government
pay
rolls
drawing
about
each
year
they
have
been
the
recipients
of
presidential
appointments
and
their
professional
ability
has
arisen
to
a
sufficiently
high
plane
so
that
they
have
been
intrusted
with
the
entire
management
and
control
of
the
great
veterans
hospital
at
tuskegee
where
their
conduct
has
taken
high
rank
they
have
shown
that
they
have
been
worthy
of
all
the
encouragement
which
they
have
received
nevertheless
they
are
too
often
subjected
to
thoughtless
and
inconsiderate
treatment
unworthy
alike
of
the
white
or
colored
races
they
have
especially
been
made
the
target
of
the
foul
crime
of
lynching
for
several
years
these
acts
of
unlawful
violence
had
been
diminishing
in
the
last
year
they
have
shown
an
increase
every
principle
of
order
and
law
and
liberty
is
opposed
to
this
crime
the
congress
should
enact
any
legislation
it
can
under
the
constitution
to
provide
for
its
elimination
american
indian
the
condition
of
the
american
indian
has
much
improved
in
recent
years
full
citizenship
was
bestowed
upon
them
on
june
and
appropriations
for
their
care
and
advancement
have
been
increased
still
there
remains
much
to
be
done
notable
increases
in
appropriations
for
the
several
major
functions
performed
by
the
department
of
the
interior
on
behalf
of
the
indians
have
marked
the
last
five
years
in
that
time
successive
annual
increases
in
appropriations
for
their
education
total
for
medical
care
and
for
industrial
advancement
or
more
than
would
have
been
spent
in
the
same
period
on
the
basis
of
appropriations
for
a
nd
the
preceding
years
the
needs
along
health
educational
industrial
and
social
lines
however
are
great
and
the
budget
estimates
for
include
still
further
increases
for
indian
administration
to
advance
the
time
when
the
indians
may
become
selfsustaining
it
is
my
belief
that
the
federal
government
should
continue
to
improve
the
facilities
for
their
care
and
as
rapidly
as
possible
turn
its
responsibility
over
to
the
states
coal
legislation
authorizing
a
system
of

administration
and
the
appointment
by
the
president
of
a
board
of
mediation
and
conciliation
in
case
of
actual
or
threatened
interruption
of
production
is
needed
the
miners
themselves
are
now
seeking
information
and
action
from
the
government
which
could
readily
be
secured
through
such
a
board
it
is
believed
that
a
thorough
investigation
and
reconsideration
of
this
proposed
policy
by
the
congress
will
demonstrate
that
this
recommendation
is
sound
and
should
be
adopted
petroleum
conservation
the
national
government
is
undertaking
to
join
in
the
formation
of
a
cooperative
committee
of
lawyers
engineers
and
public
officers
to
consider
what
legislation
by
the
states
or
by
the
congress
can
be
adopted
for
the
preservation
and
conservation
of
our
supply
of
petroleum
this
has
come
to
be
one
of
the
main
dependencies
for
transportation
and
power
so
necessary
to
our
agricultural
and
industrial
life
it
is
expected
the
report
of
this
committee
will
be
available
for
later
congressional
action
meantime
the
requirement
that
the

of
the
interior
should
make
certain
leases
of
land
belonging
to
the
osage
indians
in
accordance
with
the
act
of
march
should
be
repealed
the
authority
to
lease
should
be
discretionary
in
order
that
the
property
of
the
indians
way
not
be
wasted
and
the
public
suffer
a
future

alien

the

held
by
the

was
to
be
retained
until
suitable
provision
had
been
made
for
the
satisfaction
of
american
claims
while
still
protecting
the
american
claimants
in
order
to
afford
every
possible
accommodation
to
the
nationals
of
the
countries
whose
property
was
held
the
congress
has
made
liberal
provision
for
the
return
of
a
larger
part
of
the
property
all
trusts
under
were
returned
in
full
and
partial
returns
were
made
on
the
others
the
total
returned
was
approximately
there
is
still
retained
however
about
the
mixed
claims
commission
has
made
such
progress
in
the
adjudication
of
claims
that
legislation
can
now
be
enacted
providing
for
the
return
of
the
property
which
should
be
done
under
conditions
which
will
protect
our
government
and
our
claimants
such
a
measure
will
be
proposed
and
i
recommend
its
enactment

railroad
consolidation

legislation
is
needed
to
simplify

to
secure

for

always
under
the
control
and
with
the
approval
of

pending

can
be
made
of

meantime
both
agriculture

are

to
wait
for
needed
relief
this
is
purely
a
business
question
which
should
be
stripped
of
all
local
and
partisan
bias
and
decided
on
broad
principles
and
its
merits
in
order
to
promote
the
public
welfare
a
large
amount
of
new
construction
and

which
will
furnish
employment
for
labor
and

both
factory
and
farm
wait
on
the
decision
of
this
important
question
delay
is
holding
back
the
progress
of
our
country
many
of
the
same
arguments
are
applicable
to
the
consolidation
of
the
washington
traction
companies
veterans
the
care
which
this
country
has
lavished
on
its
veterans
is
known
of
all
men
the
yearly
outlay
for
this
purpose
is
about
or
about
the
cost
of
running
the
federal
government
outside
of
the
post
office
department
before
the
world
war
the
congress
will
have
before
it
recommendations
of
the
american
legion
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars
and
other
like
organizations
which
should
receive
candid
consideration
we
should
continue
to
foster
our
system
of
compensation
and
rehabilitation
and
provide
hospitals
and
insurance
the
magnitude
of
the
undertaking
is
already
so
large
that
all
requests
calling
for
further
expenditure
should
have
the
most
searching
scrutiny
our
present
system
of
pensions
is
already
sufficiently
liberal
it
was
increased
by
the
last
congress
for
civil
and
spanish
war
veterans
and
widows
and
for
some
dependents
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
various
governmental
agencies
now
dealing
with
veterans
relief
be
consolidated
this
would
bring
many
advantages
it
is
recommended
that
the
proper
committees
of
the
congress
make
a
thorough
survey
of
this
subject
in
order
to
determine
if
legislation
to
secure
such
consolidation
is
desirable
education
for
many
years
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
to
encourage
and
foster
the
cause
of
education
large
sums
of
money
are
annually
appropriated
to
carry
on
vocational
training
many
millions
go
into
agricultural
schools
the
general
subject
is
under
the
immediate
direction
of
a
commissioner
of
education
while
this
subject
is
strictly
a
state
and
local
function
it
should
continue
to
have
the
encouragement
of
the
national
government
i
am
still
of
the
opinion
that
much
good
could
be
accomplished
through
the
establishment
of
a
department
of
education
and
relief
into
which
would
be
gathered
all
of
these
functions
under
one
directing

of

industrial
relations
have
never
been
more
peaceful
in
recent
months
they
have
suffered
from
only
one
serious
controversy
in
all
others
difficulties
have
been
adjusted
both
management
and
labor
wishing
to
settle
controversies
by
friendly
agreement
rather
than
by
compulsion
the
welfare
of
women
and

is
being
especially
guarded
by
our
department
of
labor
its
childrens
bureau
is
in
cooperation
with
state
boards
and
juvenile
courts
through
its
bureau
of
immigration
it
has
been
found
that
medical
examination
abroad
has
saved
prospective
immigrants
from
much
hardship
some
further
legislation
to
provide
for
reuniting
families
when
either
the
husband
or
the
wife
is
in
this
country
and
granting
more
freedom
for
the
migration
of
the
north

is
desirable

has
enabled

particular
attention
has
been
given
to
assisting
men
past
middle
life
and
in
providing
field
labor
for
harvesting
agricultural
crops
this
has
been
made
possible
in
part
through
the
service
of
the
federal
board
for
vocational
education
which
is
cooperating
with
the

in
a
program
to

have
reached
a
time
when
not
only
the
conveniences
but
the
architectural
beauty
of
the

been
made
for

which
may
well
have
the
consideration
of
the

and
the
commission
intrusted

will
undoubtedly
recommend

february
is
the
one
hundred
and
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
capture
of
fort
sackville
at
vincennes
in
the
state
of
indiana
this
eventually
brought
into
the
union
what
was
known
as
the
northwest
territory
embracing
the
region
north
of
the
ohio
river
between
the
alleghenies
and
the
mississippi
river
this
expedition
was
led
by
george
rogers
clark
his
heroic
character
and
the
importance
of
his
victory
are
too
little
known
and
understood
they
gave
us
not
only
this
northwest
territory
but
by
means
of
that
the
prospect
of
reaching
the
pacific
the
state
of
indiana
is
proposing
to
dedicate
the
site
of
fort
sackville
as
a
national
shrine
the
federal
government
may
well
make
some
provision
for
the
erection
under
its
own
management
of
a
fitting
memorial
at
that
point
foreign

it
is
the
policy
of
the
united

to
promote
peace
we
are
a
peaceful
people
and
committed
to
the
settling
of
disputes
by
amicable
adjustment
rather
than
by
force
we
have
believed
that
peace
can
best
be
secured
by
a
faithful
observance
on
our
part
of
the
principles
of
international
law
accompanied
by
patience
and
conciliation
and
requiring
of
others
a
like
treatment
for
ourselves
we
have
lately
had
some
difference
with
mexico
relative
to
the
injuries
inflicted
upon
our
nationals
and
their
property
within
that
country
a
firm
adherence
to
our
rights
and
a
scrupulous
respect
for
the
sovereignty
of
mexico
both
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
nations
coupled
with
patience
and
forbearance
it
is
hoped
will
resolve
all
our
differences
without
interfering
with
the
friendly
relationship
between
the
two
governments
we
have
been
compelled
to
send
naval
and
marine
forces
to
china
to
protect
the
lives
and
property
of
our
citizens
fortunately
their
simple
presence
there
has
been
sufficient
to
prevent
any
material
loss
of
life
but
there
has
been
considerable
loss
of
property
that
unhappy
country
is
torn
by
factions
and
revolutions
which
bid
fair
to
last
for
an
indefinite
period
meanwhile
we
are
protecting
our
citizens
and
stand
ready
to
cooperate
with
any
government
which
may
emerge
in
promoting
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
china
they
have
always
had
our
friendship
and
they
should
especially
merit
our
consideration
in
these
days
of
their
distraction
and
distress
we
were
confr
onted
by
similar
condition
on
a
small
scale
in
nicaragua
our
marine
and
naval
forces
protected
our
citizens
and
their
property
and
prevented
a
heavy
sacrifice
of
life
and
the
destruction
of
that
country
by
a
reversion
to
a
state
of
revolution
henry
l
stimson
former
secretary
of
war
was
sent
there
to
cooperate
with
our
diplomatic
and
military
officers
in
effecting
a
settlement
between
the
contending
parties
this
was
done
on
the
assurance
that
we
would
cooperate
in
restoring
a
state
of
peace
where
our
rights
would
be
protected
by
giving
our
assistance
in
the
conduct
of
the
next
presidential
election
which
occurs
in
a
few
months
with
this
assurance
the
population
returned
to
their
peacetime
pursuits
with
the
exception
of
some
small
roving
bands
of
outlaws
in
general
our
relations
with
other
countries
can
be
said
to
have
improved
within
the
year
while
having
a
due
regard
for
our
own
affairs
the
protection
of
our
own
rights
and
the
advancement
of
our
own
people
we
can
afford
to
be
liberal
toward
others
our
example
has
become
of
great
importance
in
the
world
it
is
recognized
that
we
are
independent
detached
and
can
and
do
take
a
disinterested
position
in
relation
to
international
affairs
our
charity
embraces
the
earth
our
trade
is
far
flung
our
financial
favors
are
widespread
those
who
are
peaceful
and
lawabiding
realize
that
not
only
have
they
nothing
to
fear
from
us
but
that
they
can
rely
on
our
moral
support
proposals
for
promoting
the
peace
of
the
world
will
have
careful
consideration
but
we
are
not
a
people
who
are
always
seeking
for
a
sign
we
know
that
peace
comes
from
honesty
and
fair
dealing
from
moderation
and
a
generous
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
the
heart
of
the
nation
is
more
important
than
treaties
a
spirit
of
generous
consideration
is
a
more
certain
defense
than
great
armaments
we
should
continue
to
promote
peace
by
our
example
and
fortify
it
by
such
international
covenants
against
war
as
we
are
permitted
under
our
constitution
to
make
american
progress
our
country
has
made
much
progress
but
it
has
taken
and
will
continue
to
take
much
effort
competition
will
be
keen
the
temptation
to
selfishness
and
arrogance
will
be
severe
the
provocations
to
deal
harshly
with
weaker
peoples
will
be
many
all
of
these
are
embraced
in
the
opportunity
for
true
greatness
they
will
be
overbalanced
by
cooperation
by
generosity
and
a
spirit
of
neighborly
kindness
the
forces
of
the
universe
are
taking
humanity
in
that
direction
in
doing
good
in
walking
humbly
in
sustaining
its
own
people
in
ministering

america
will
work
out
its
own
mighty
destiny

members
of
the
congress
in
reporting
to
the
congress
the
state
of
the
union
i
find
it
impossible
to
characterize
it
other
than
one
of
general
peace
and
prosperity
in
some
quarters
our
diplomacy
is
vexed
with
difficult
and
as
yet
unsolved
problems
but
nowhere
are
we
met
with
armed
conflict
if
some
occupations
and
areas
are
not
flourishing
in
none
does
there
remain
any
acute
chronic
depression
what
the
country
requires
is
not
so
much
new
policies
as
a
steady
continuation
of
those
which
are
already
being
crowned
with
such
abundant
success
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
that
in
common
with
all
the
world
we
are
engaged
in
liquidating
the
war
in
the
present
short
session
no
great
amount
of
new
legislation
is
possible
but
in
order
to
comprehend
what
is
most
desirable
some
survey
of
our
general
situation
is
necessary
a
large
amount
of
time
is
consumed
in
the
passage
of
appropriation
bills
if
each
congress
in
its
opening
session
would
make
appropriations
to
continue
for
two
years
very
much
time
would
be
saved
which
could
either
be
devoted
to
a
consideration
of
the
general
needs
of
the
country
or
would
result
in
decreasing
the
work
of
legislation
economy
our
present
state
of
prosperity
has
been
greatly
promoted
by
three
important
causes
one
of
which
is
economy
resulting
in
reduction
and
reform
in
national
taxation
another
is
the
elimination
of
many
kinds
of
waste
the
third
is
a
general
raising
of
the
standards
of
efficiency
this
combination
has
brought
the
perfectly
astonishing
result
of
a
reduction
in
the
index
price
of
commodities
and
an
increase
in
the
index
rate
of
wages
we
have
secured
a
lowering
of
the
cost
to
produce
and
a
raising
of
the
ability
to
consume
prosperity
resulting
from
these
causes
rests
on
the
securest
of
all
foundations
it
gathers
strength
from
its
own
progress
in
promoting
this
progress
the
chief
part
which
the
national
government
plays
lies
in
the
field
of
economy
whatever
doubts
may
have
been
entertained
as
to
the
necessity
of
this
policy
and
the
beneficial
results
which
would
accrue
from
it
to
all
the
people
of
the
nation
its
wisdom
must
now
be
considered
thoroughly
demonstrated
it
may
not
have
appeared
to
be
a
novel
or
perhaps
brilliant
conception
but
it
has
turned
out
to
be
preeminently
sound
it
has
not
failed
to
work
it
has
surely
brought
results
it
does
not
have
to
be
excused
as
a
temporary
expedient
adopted
as
the
lesser
evil
to
remedy
some
abuse
it
is
not
a
palliative
seeking
to
treat
symptoms
but
a
major
operation
for
the
eradication
at
the
source
of
a
large
number
of
social
diseases
nothing
is
easier
than
the
expenditure
of
public
money
it
does
not
appear
to
belong
to
anybody
the
temptation
is
overwhelming
to
bestow
it
on
somebody
but
the
results
of
extravagance
are
ruinous
the
property
of
the
country
like
the
freedom
of
the
country
belongs
to
the
people
of
the
country
they
have
not
empowered
their
government
to
take
a
dollar
of
it
except
for
a
necessary
public
purpose
but
if
the
constitution
conferred
such
right
sound
economics
would
forbid
it
nothing
is
more
destructive
of
the
progress
of
the
nation
than
government
extravagance
it
means
an
increase
in
the
burden
of
taxation
dissipation
of
the
returns
from
enterprise
a
decrease
in
the
real
value
of
wages
with
ultimate
stagnation
and
decay
the
whole
theory
of
our
institutions
is
based
on
the
liberty
and
independence
of
the
individual
he
is
dependent
on
himself
for
support
and
therefore
entitled
to
the
rewards
of
his
own
industry
he
is
not
to
be
deprived
of
what
he
earns
that
others
may
be
benefited
by
what
they
do
not
earn
what
he
saves
through
his
private
effort
is
not
to
be
wasted
by
government
extravagance
our
national
activities
have
become
so
vast
that
it
is
necessary
to
scrutinize
each
item
of
public
expenditure
if
we
are
to
apply
the
principle
of
economy
at
the
last
session
we
made
an
immediate
increase
in
the
annual
budget
of
more
than
in
benefits
conferred
on
the
veterans
of
three
wars
public
buildings
and
river
and
harbor
improvement
many
projects
are
being
broached
requiring
further
large
outlays
i
am
convinced
that
it
would
be
greatly
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
if
we
avoid
at
the
present
session
all
commitments
except
those
of
the
most
pressing
nature
from
a
reduction
of
the
debt
and
taxes
will
accrue
a
wider
benefit
to
all
the
people
of
this
country
than
from
embarking
on
any
new
enterprise
when
our
war
debt
is
decreased
we
shall
have
resources
for
expansion
until
that
is
accomplished
we
should
confine
ourselves
to
expenditures
of
the
most
urgent
necessity
the
department
of
commerce
has
performed
a
most
important
function
in
making
plans
and
securing
support
of
all
kinds
of
national
enterprise
for
the
elimination
of
waste
efficiency
has
been
greatly
promoted
through
good
management
and
the
constantly
increasing
cooperation
of
the
wage
earners
throughout
the
whole
realm
of
private
business
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
whole
development
has
been
predicated
on
the
foundation
of
a
protective
tariff
tax
reduction
as
a
result
of
economy
of
administration
by
the
executive
and
of
appropriation
by
the
congress
the
end
of
this
fiscal
year
will
leave
a
surplus
in
the
treasury
estimated
at
unless
otherwise
ordered
such
surplus
is
used
for
the
retirement
of
the
war
debt
a
bond
which
can
be
retired
today
for
cents
will
cost
the
people
cents
to
retire
a
year
from
now
while
i
favor
a
speedy
reduction
of
the
debt
as
already
required
by
law
and
in
accordance
with
the
promises
made
to
the
holders
of
our
liberty
bonds
when
they
were
issued
there
is
no
reason
why
a
balanced
portion
of
surplus
revenue
should
not
be
applied
to
a
reduction
of
taxation
it
can
not
be
repeated
too
often
that
the
enormous
revenues
of
this
nation
could
not
be
collected
without
becoming
a
charge
on
all
the
people
whether
or
not
they
directly
pay
taxes
everyone
who
is
paying
or
the
bare
necessities
of
fool
and
shelter
and
clothing
without
considering
the
better
things
of
life
is
indirectly
paying
a
national
tax
the
nearly
owners
of
securities
the
additional
scores
of
millions
of
holders
of
insurance
policies
and
depositors
in
savings
banks
are
all
paying
a
national
tax
millions
of
individuals
and
corporations
are
making
a
direct
contribution
to
the
national
treasury
which
runs
from
to
per
cent
of
their
income
besides
a
number
of
special
requirements
like
automobile
and
admission
taxes
whenever
the
state
of
the
treasury
will
permit
i
believe
in
a
reduction
of
taxation
i
think
the
taxpayers
are
entitled
to
it
but
i
am
not
advocating
tax
reduction
merely
for
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
i
am
advocating
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
if
it
appeared
feasible
i
should
welcome
permanent
tax
reduction
at
this
time
the
estimated
surplus
however
for
june
is
not
much
larger
than
is
required
in
a
going
business
of
nearly
we
have
had
but
a
few
months
experience
under
the
present
revenue
act
and
shall
need
to
know
what
is
developed
by
the
returns
of
income
produced
under
it
which
are
not
required
t
o
be
made
until
about
the
time
this
session
terminates
and
what
the
economic
probabilities
of
the
country
are
in
the
latter
part
of
before
we
can
reach
any
justifiable
conclusion
as
to
permanent
tax
reduction
moreover
the
present
surplus
results
from
many
nonrecurrent
items
meantime
it
is
possible
to
grant
some
real
relief
by
a
simple
measure
making
reductions
in
the
payments
which
accrue
on
the
th
of
march
and
june
i
am
very
strongly
of
the
conviction
that
this
is
so
much
a
purely
business
matter
that
it
ought
not
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
partisan
spirit
the
congress
has
already
set
the
notable
example
of
treating
tax
problems
without
much
reference
to
party
which
might
well
be
continued
what
i
desire
to
advocate
most
earnestly
is
relief
for
the
country
from
unnecessary
tax
burdens
we
can
not
secure
that
if
we
stop
to
engage
in
a
partisan
controversy
as
i
do
not
think
any
change
in
the
special
taxes
or
tiny
permanent
reduction
is
practical
i
therefore
urge
both
parties
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
to
agree
on
a
bill
granting
the
temporary
relief
which
i
have
indicated
such
a
reduction
would
directly
affect
millions
of
taxpayers
release
large
sums
for
investment
in
new
enterprise
stimulating
industrial
production
and
agricultural
consumption
and
indirectly
benefiting
every
family
in
the
whole
country
these
are
my
convictions
stated
with
full
knowledge
that
it
is
for
the
congress
to
decide
whether
they
judge
it
best
to
make
such
a
reduction
or
leave
the
surplus
for
the
present
year
to
be
applied
to
retirement
of
the
war
debt
that
also
is
eventually
tax
reduction
protective
tariff
it
is
estimated
that
customs
receipts
for
the
present
fiscal
year
will
exceed
the
largest
which
were
ever
secured
from
that
source
the
value
of
our
imports
for
the
last
fiscal
year
was
an
increase
of
more
than
per
cent
since
the
present
tariff
law
went
into
effect
of
these
imports
about
per
cent
or
roughly
came
in
free
of
duty
which
means
that
the
united
states
affords
a
dutyfree
market
to
other
countries
almost
equal
in
value
to
the
total
imports
of
germany
and
greatly
exceeding
the
total
imports
of
france
we
have
admitted
a
greater
volume
of
free
imports
than
any
other
country
except
england
we
are
therefore
levying
duties
on
about
of
imports
nearly
half
of
this
or
is
subject
to
duties
for
the
protection
of
agriculture
and
have
their
origin
in
countries
other
than
europe
they
substantially
increased
the
prices
received
by
our
farmers
for
their
produce
about
more
is
represented
by
luxuries
such
as
costly
rugs
furs
precious
stones
etc
this
leaves
only
about
of
our
imports
under
a
schedule
of
duties
which
is
in
general
under
consideration
when
there
is
discussion
of
lowering
the
tariff
while
the
duties
on
this
small
portion
representing
only
about
per
cent
of
our
imports
undoubtedly
represent
the
difference
between
a
fair
degree
of
prosperity
or
marked
depression
to
many
of
our
industries
and
the
difference
between
good
pay
and
steady
work
or
wide
unemployment
to
many
of
our
wage
earners
it
is
impossibl
e
to
conceive
how
other
countries
or
our
own
importers
could
be
greatly
benefited
if
these
duties
are
reduced
those
who
are
starting
an
agitation
for
a
reduction
of
tariff
duties
partly
at
least
for
the
benefit
of
those
to
whom
money
has
been
lent
abroad
ought
to
know
that
there
does
not
seem
to
be
a
very
large
field
within
the
area
of
our
imports
in
which
probable
reductions
would
be
advantageous
to
foreign
goods
those
who
wish
to
benefit
foreign
producers
are
much
more
likely
to
secure
that
result
by
continuing
the
present
enormous
purchasing
power
which
comes
from
our
prosperity
that
increased
our
imports
over
per
cent
in
four
years
than
from
any
advantages
that
are
likely
to
accrue
from
a
general
tariff
reduction
agriculture
the
important
place
which
agriculture
holds
in
the
economic
and
social
life
of
the
nation
can
not
be
overestimated
the
national
government
is
justified
in
putting
forth
every
effort
to
make
the
open
country
a
desirable
place
to
live
no
condition
meets
this
requirement
which
fails
to
supply
a
fair
return
on
labor
expended
and
capital
invested
while
some
localities
and
some
particular
crops
furnish
exceptions
in
general
agriculture
is
continuing
to
make
progress
in
recovering
from
the
depression
of
and
animal
products
and
food
products
are
in
a
more
encouraging
position
while
cotton
due
to
the
high
prices
of
past
years
supplemented
by
ideal
weather
conditions
has
been
stimulated
to
a
point
of
temporary
over
production
acting
on
the
request
of
the
cotton
growing
interests
appointed
a
committee
to
assist
in
carrying
out
their
plans
as
it
result
of
this
cooperation
sufficient
funds
have
been
pledged
to
finance
the
storage
and
carrying
of
bales
of
cotton
whether
those
who
own
the
cotton
are
willing
to
put
a
part
of
their
stock
into
this
plan
depends
on
themselves
the
federal
government
has
cooperated
in
providing
ample
facilities
no
method
of
meeting
the
situation
would
be
adequate
which
does
not
contemplate
a
reduction
of
about
onethird
in
the
acreage
for
the
coming
year
the
responsibility
for
making
the
plan
effective
lies
with
those
who
own
and
finance
cotton
and
cotton
lands
the
department
of
agriculture
estimates
the
net
income
of
agriculture
for
the
year
at
only
for
for
this
increase
has
been
brought
about
in
part
by
the
method
already
referred
to
of
federal
tax
reduction
the
elimination
of
waste
and
increased
efficiency
in
industry
the
wide
gap
that
existed
a
few
years
ago
between
the
index
price
of
agricultural
products
and
the
index
price
of
other
products
has
been
gradually
closing
up
though
the
recent
depression
in
cotton
has
somewhat
enlarged
it
agriculture
had
on
the
whole
been
going
higher
while
industry
had
been
growing
lower
industrial
and
commercial
activities
being
carried
on
for
the
most
part
by
corporations
are
taxed
at
a
much
higher
rate
than
farming
which
is
carried
on
by
individuals
this
will
inevitably
make
industrial
commodity
costs
high
while
war
taxation
lasts
it
is
because
of
this
circumstance
that
national
tax
reduction
has
a
very
large
indirect
benefit
upon
the
farmer
though
it
can
not
relieve
him
from
the
very
great
burden
of
the
local
taxes
which
he
pays
directly
we
have
practically
relieved
the
farmer
of
any
federal
income
tax
there
is
agreement
on
all
sides
that
some
portions
of
our
agricultural
industry
have
lagged
behind
other
industries
in
recovery
from
the
war
and
that
further
improvement
in
methods
of
marketing
of
agricultural
products
is
most
desirable
there
is
belief
also
that
the
federal
government
can
further
contribute
to
these
ends
beyond
the
many
helpful
measures
taken
during
the
last
five
years
through
the
different
acts
of
congress
for
advancing
the
interests
of
the
farmers
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
establishing
of
the
intermediate
credit
banks
for
agricultural
purposes
the
purnell
act
for
agricultural
research
the
cappervolstead
cooperative
marketing
act
the
cooperative
marketing
act
of
amendments
to
the
warehousing
act
the
enlargement
of
the
activities
of
the
department
of
agriculture
enlargement
of
the
scope
of
loans
by
the
farm
loan
board
the
tariff
on
agricultural
products
the
large
federal
expenditure
in
improvement
of
waterways
and
highways
the
reduction
of
federal
taxes
in
all
comprise
a
great
series
of
governmental
actions
in
the
advancement
of
the
special
interest
of
agriculture
in
determination
of
what
further
measures
may
be
undertaken
it
seems
to
me
there
are
certain
pitfalls
which
must
be
avoided
and
our
test
in
avoiding
them
should
be
to
avoid
disaster
to
the
farmer
himself
acting
upon
my
recommendation
the
congress
has
ordered
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
investigate
the
freightrate
structure
directing
that
such
changes
shall
be
made
in
freight
rates
as
will
promote
freedom
of
movement
of
agricultural
products
railroad
consolidation
which
i
am
advocating
would
also
result
in
a
situation
where
rates
could
be
made
more
advantageous
for
farm
produce
as
has
recently
been
done
in
the
revision
of
rates
on
fertilizers
in
the
south
additional
benefit
will
accrue
from
the
development
of
our
inland
waterways
the
mississippi
river
system
carries
a
commerce
of
over
tons
at
a
saving
of
nearly
annually
the
inland
waterways
corporation
operates
boats
on
miles
of
navigable
streams
and
through
its
relation
with
railroads
carries
freight
into
and
out
of
states
of
the
union
during
the
past
six
months
it
has
handled
over
bushels
of
grain
monthly
and
by
its
lower
freight
rates
has
raised
the
price
of
such
grain
to
the
farmer
probably
cents
to
cents
a
bushel
the
highway
system
on
which
the
federal
government
expends
about
a
year
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
rural
regions
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
more
comprehensive
and
less
expensive
system
of
transportation
for
agriculture
ought
to
be
supplemented
by
provision
for
an
adequate
supply
of
fertilizer
at
a
lower
cost
than
it
is
at
present
obtainable
this
advantage
we
are
attempting
to
secure
by
the
proposed
development
at
muscle
shoals
and
there
are
promising
experiments
being
made
in
synthetic
chemistry
for
the
production
of
nitrates
a
survey
should
be
made
of
the
relation
of
government
grazing
lands
to
the
livestock
industry
additional
legislation
is
desirable
more
definitely
to
establish
the
place
of
grazing
in
the
administration
of
the
national
forests
properly
subordinated
to
their
functions
of
producing
timber
and
conserving
the
water
supply
over
acres
of
grazing
lands
are
still
pastured
as
commons
in
the
public
domain
with
little
or
no
regulation
this
has
made
their
use
so
uncertain
that
it
has
contributed
greatly
to
the
instability
of
the
livestock
industry
very
little
of
this
land
is
suited
to
settlement
or
private
ownership
some
plan
ought
to
be
adopted
for
its
use
in
grazing
corresponding
broadly
to
that
already
successfully
applied
to
the
national
forests
the
development
of
sound
and
strong
cooperative
associations
is
of
fundamental
importance
to
our
agriculture
it
is
encouraging
to
note
therefore
that
a
vigorous
and
healthy
growth
in
the
cooperative
movement
is
continuing
cooperative
associations
reporting
to
the
department
of
agriculture
at
the
end
of
had
on
their
membership
rolls
a
total
of
producers
their
total
business
in
amounted
to
approximately
compared
with
in
legislative
action
to
assist
cooperative
associations
and
supplement
their
efforts
was
passed
at
the
last
session
of
congress
important
credit
measures
were
also
provided
by
congress
in
which
have
been
of
inestimable
value
to
the
cooperative
associations
although
the
federal
credit
agencies
have
served
agriculture
well
i
think
it
may
be
possible
to
broaden
and
strengthen
the
service
of
these
institutions
attention
is
again
directed
to
the
surplus
problem
of
agriculture
by
the
present
cotton
situation
surpluses
often
affect
prices
of
various
farm
commodities
in
a
disastrous
manner
and
the
problem
urgently
demands
a
solution
discussions
both
in
and
out
of
congress
during
the
past
few
years
have
given
us
a
better
understanding
of
the
subject
and
it
is
my
hope
that
out
of
the
various
proposals
made
the
basis
will
be
found
for
a
sound
and
effective
solution
upon
which
agreement
can
be
reached
in
my
opinion
cooperative
marketing
associations
will
be
important
aids
to
the
ultimate
solution
of
the
problem
it
may
well
be
however
that
additional
measures
will
be
needed
to
supplement
their
efforts
i
believe
all
will
agree
that
such
measures
should
not
conflict
with
the
best
interests
of
the
cooperatives
but
rather
assist
and
strengthen
them
in
working
out
this
problem
to
any
sound
conclusion
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
putting
the
government
into
the
business
of
production
or
marketing
or
attempting
to
enact
legislation
for
the
purpose
of
price
fixing
the
farmer
does
not
favor
any
attempted
remedies
that
partake
of
these
elements
he
has
a
sincere
and
candid
desire
for
assistance
if
matched
by
an
equally
sincere
and
candid
consideration
of
the
different
remedies
proposed
a
sound
measure
of
relief
ought
to
result
it
is
unfortunate
that
no
general
agreement
has
been
reached
by
the
various
agricultural
interests
upon
any
of
the
proposed
remedies
out
of
the
discussion
of
various
proposals
which
can
be
had
before
the
committees
of
agriculture
some
measure
ought
to
be
perfected
which
would
be
generally
satisfactory
due
to
the
emergency
arising
from
a
heavy
tropical
storm
in
southern
florida
i
authorized
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
use
certain
funds
in
anticipation
of
legislation
to
enable
the
farmers
in
that
region
to
plant
their
crops
the
department
will
present
a
bill
ratifying
the
loans
which
were
made
for
this
purpose
federal
legislation
has
been
adopted
authorizing
the
cooperation
of
the
government
with
states
and
private
owners
in
the
protection
of
forest
lands
from
fire
this
preventive
measure
is
of
such
great
importance
that
i
have
recommended
for
it
an
increased
appropriation
another
preventive
measure
of
great
economic
and
sanitary
importance
is
the
eradication
of
tuberculosis
in
cattle
active
work
is
now
in

progress
in
onefourth
of
the
counties
of
the
united
states
to
secure
this
result
over
cattle
have
been
under
treatment
and
the
average
degree
of
infection
has
fallen
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
he
federal
government
is
making
substantial
expenditures
for
this
purpose
serious
damage
is
threatened
to
the
corn
crop
by
the
european
corn
borer
since
it
has
spread
from
eastern
new
england
westward
into
indiana
and
now
covers
about
square
miles
it
is
one
of
the
most
formidable
pests
because
it
spreads
rapidly
and
is
exceedingly
difficult
of
control
it
has
assumed
a
menace
that
is
of
national
magnitude
and
warrants
the
federal
government
in
extending
its
cooperation
to
the
state
and
local
agencies
which
are
attempting
to
prevent
its
further
spread
and
secure
its
eradication
the
whole
question
of
agriculture
needs
most
careful
consideration
in
the
past
few
years
the
government
has
given
this
subject
more
attention
than
any
other
and
has
held
more
consultations
in
relation
to
it
than
on
any
other
subject
while
the
government
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
failure
to
perform
the
impossible
the
agricultural
regions
are
entitled
to
know
that
they
have
its
constant
solicitude
and
sympathy
many
of
the
farmers
are
burdened
with
debts
and
taxes
which
they
are
unable
to
carry
we
are
expending
in
this
country
many
millions
of
dollars
each
year
to
increase
farm
production
we
ought
now
to
put
more
emphasis
on
the
question
of
farm
marketing
if
a
sound
solution
of
a
permanent
nature
can
be
found
for
this
problem
the
congress
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
adopt
it
development
of
water
resources
in
previous
messages
i
have
referred
to
the
national
importance
of
the
proper
development
of
our
water
resources
the
great
projects
of
extension
of
the
mississippi
system
the
protection
an
development
of
the
lower
colorado
river
are
before
congress
and
i
have
previously
commented
upon
them
i
favor
the
necessary
legislation
to
expedite
these
projects
engineering
studies
are
being
made
for
connecting
the
great
lakes
with
the
north
atlantic
either
through
an
allamerican
canal
or
by
way
of
the
st
lawrence
river
these
reports
will
undoubtedly
be
before
the
congress
during
its
present
session
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
upon
the
great
importance
of
such
a
waterway
not
only
to
our
midcontinental
basin
but
to
the
commerce
and
development
of
practically
the
whole
nation
our
river
and
harbor
improvement
should
be
continued
in
accordance
with
the
present
policy
expenditure
of
this
character
is
compatible
with
economy
it
is
in
the
nature
of
capital
investment
work
should
proceed
on
the
basic
trunk
lines
if
this
work
is
to
be
a
success
if
the
country
will
be
content
to
be
moderate
and
patient
and
permit
improvements
to
be
made
where
they
will
do
the
greatest
general
good
rather
than
insisting
on
expenditures
at
this
time
on
secondary
projects
our
internal
waterways
can
be
made
a
success
if
proposes
legislation
results
in
a
gross
manifestation
of
local
jealousies
and
selfishness
this
program
can
not
be
carried
out
ultimately
we
can
take
care
of
extensions
but
our
first
effort
should
be
confined
to
the
main
arteries
our
inland
commerce
has
been
put
to
great
inconvenience
and
expense
by
reason
of
the
lowering
of
the
water
level
of
the
great
lakes
this
is
an
international
problem
on
which
competent
engineers
are
making
reports
out
of
their
study
it
is
expected
that
a
feasible
method
will
be
developed
for
raising
the
level
to
provide
relief
for
our
commerce
and
supply
water
for
drainage
whenever
a
practical
plan
is
presented
it
ought
to
be
speedily
adopted
reclamation
it
is
increasingly
evident
that
the
federal
government
must
in
the
future
take
a
leading
part
in
the
impounding
of
water
for
conservation
with
incidental
power
for
the
development
of
the
irrigable
lands
of
the
and
region
the
unused
waters
of
the
west
are
found
mainly
in
large
rivers
works
to
store
and
distribute
these
have
such
magnitude
and
cost
that
they
are
not
attractive
to
private
enterprise
water
is
the
irreplaceable
natural
resource
its
precipitation
can
not
be
increased
its
storage
on
the
higher
reaches
of
streams
to
meet
growing
needs
to
be
used
repeatedly
as
it
flows
toward
the
seas
is
a
practical
and
prudent
business
policy
the
united
states
promises
to
follow
the
course
of
older
irrigation
countries
where
recent
important
irrigation
developments
have
been
carried
out
as
national
undertakings
it
is
gratifying
therefore
that
conditions
on
federal
reclamation
projects
have
become
satisfactory
the
gross
value
of
crop
grown
with
water
from
project
works
increased
from
in
to
in
the
adjustments
made
last
year
by
congress
relieved
irrigators
from
paying
construction
costs
on
unprofitable
land
and
by
so
doing
inspired
new
hope
and
confidence
in
ability
to
meet
the
payments
required
construction
payments
by
water
users
last
year
were
the
largest
in
the
history
of
the
bureau
the
anticipated
reclamation
fund
will
be
fully
absorbed
for
a
number
of
years
in
the
completion
of
old
projects
and
the
construction
of
projects
inaugurated
in
the
past
three
years
we
should
however
continue
to
investigate
and
study
the
possibilities
of
a
carefully
planned
development
of
promising
projects
logically
of
governmental
concern
because
of
their
physical
magnitude
immense
cost
and
the
interstate
and
international
problems
involved
only
in
this
way
may
we
be
fully
prepared
to
meet
intelligently
the
needs
of
our
fastgrowing
population
in
the
years
to
come
transportation
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
of
any
modern
activity
which
contributes
more
to
the
necessities
and
conveniences
of
life
than
transportation
without
it
our
present
agricultural
production
and
practically
all
of
our
commerce
would
be
completely
prostrated
one
of
the
large
contributing
causes
to
the
present
highly
satisfactory
state
of
our
economic
condition
is
the
prompt
and
dependable
service
surpassing
all
our
previous
records
rendered
by
the
railroads
this
power
has
been
fostered
by
the
spirit
of
cooperation
between
federal
and
state
regulatory
commissions
to
render
this
service
more
efficient
and
effective
and
to
promote
a
more
scientific
regulation
the
process
of
valuing
railroad
properties
should
be
simplified
and
the
primary
valuations
should
be
completed
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
problem
of
rate
reduction
would
be
much
simplified
by
a
process
of
railroad
consolidations
this
principle
has
already
been
adopted
as
federal
law
experience
has
shown
that
a
more
effective
method
must
be
provided
studies
have
already
been
made
and
legislation
introduced
seeking
to
promote
this
end
it
would
be
of
great
advantage
if
it
could
be
taken
up
at
once
and
speedily
enacted
the
railroad
systems
of
the
country
and
the
convenience
of
all
the
people
are
waiting
on
this
important
decision
merchant
marine
it
is
axiomatic
that
no
agricultural
and
industrial
country
can
get
the
full
benefit
of
its
own
advantages
without
a
merchant
marine
we
have
been
proceeding
under
the
act
of
congress
that
contemplates
the
establishment
of
trade
routes
to
be
ultimately
transferred
to
private
ownership
and
operation
due
to
temporary
conditions
abroad
and
at
home
we
have
a
large
demand
just
now
for
certain
types
of
freight
vessels
some
suggestion
has
been
made
for
new
construction
i
do
not
feel
that
we
are
yet
warranted
in
entering
that
field
such
ships
as
we
might
build
could
not
be
sold
after
they
are
launched
for
anywhere
near
what
they
would
cost
we
have
expended
over
out
of
the
public
treasury
in
recent
years
to
make
up
the
losses
of
operation
not
counting
the
depreciation
or
any
cost
whatever
of
our
capital
investment
the
great
need
of
our
merchant
marine
is
not
for
more
ships
but
for
more
freight
our
merchants
are
altogether
too
indifferent
about
using
american
ships
for
the
transportation
of
goods
which
they
send
abroad
or
bring
home
some
of
our
vessels
necessarily
need
repairs
which
should
be
made
i
do
not
believe
that
the
operation
of
our
fleet
is
as
economical
and
efficient
as
it
could
be
made
if
placed
under
a
single
responsible
head
leaving
the
shipping
board
free
to
deal
with
general
matters
of
policy
and
regulation
radio
legislation
the
department
of
commerce
has
for
some
years
urgently
presented
the
necessity
for
further
legislation
in
order
to
protect
radio
listeners
from
interference
between
broadcasting
stations
and
to
carry
out
other
regulatory
functions
both
branches
of
congress
at
the
last
session
passed
enactments
intended
to
effect
such
regulation
but
the
two
bills
yet
remain
to
be
brought
into
agreement
and
final
passage
due
to
decisions
of
the
courts
the
authority
of
the
department
under
the
law
of
has
broken
down
many
more
stations
have
been
operating
than
can
be
accommodated
within
the
limited
number
of
wave
lengths
available
further
stations
are
in
course
of
construction
many
stations
have
departed
from
the
scheme
of
allocation
set
down
by
the
department
and
the
whole
service
of
this
most
important
public
function
has
drifted
into
such
chaos
as
seems
likely
if
not
remedied
to
destroy
its
great
value
i
most
urgently
recommend
that
this
legislation
should
be
speedily
enacted
i
do
not
believe
it
is
desirable
to
set
up
further
independent
agencies
in
the
government
rather
i
believe
it
advisable
to
entrust
the
important
functions
of
deciding
who
shall
exercise
the
privilege
of
radio
transmission
and
under
what
conditions
the
assigning
of
wave
lengths
and
determination
of
power
to
a
board
to
be
assembled
whenever
action
on
such
questions
becomes
necessary
there
should
be
right
of
appeal
to
the
courts
from
the
decisions
of
such
board
the
administration
of
the
decisions
of
the
board
and
the
other
features
of
regulation
and
promotion
of
radio
in
the
public
interest
together
with
scientific
research
should
remain
in
the
department
of
commerce
such
an
arrangement
makes
for
more
expert
more
efficient
and
more
economical
administration
that
an
independent
agency
or
board
whose
duties
after
initial
stages
require
but
little
attention
in
which
administrative
functions
are
confused

with
semijudicial
functions
and
from
which
of
necessity
there
must
be
greatly
increased
personnel
and
expenditure
the
wage
earner
the
great
body
of
our
people
are
made
up
of
wage
earners
several
hundred
thousands
of
them
are
on
the
pay
rolls
of
the
united
states
government
their
condition
very
largely
is
fixed
by
legislation
we
have
recently
provided
increases
in
compensation
under
a
method
of
reclassification
and
given
them
the
advantage
of
a
liberal
retirement
system
as
a
support
for
their
declining
years
most
of
them
are
under
the
merit
system
which
is
a
guaranty
of
their
intelligence
and
the
efficiency
of
their
service
is
a
demonstration
of
their
loyalty
the
federal
government
should
continue
to
set
a
good
example
for
all
other
employers
in
the
industries
the
condition
of
the
wage
earner
has
steadily
improved
the
hour
day
is
almost
entirely
unknown
skilled
labor
is
well
compensated
but
there
are
unfortunately
a
multitude
of
workers
who
have
not
yet
come
to
share
in
the
general
prosperity
of
the
nation
both
the
public
authorities
and
private
enterprise
should
be
solicitous
to
advance
the
welfare
of
this
class
the
federal
government
has
been
seeking
to
secure
this
end
through
a
protective
tariff
through
restrictive
immigration
through
requiring
safety
devices
for
the
prevention
of
accidents
through
the
granting
of
workmans
compensation
through
civilian
vocational
rehabilitation
and
education
through
employment
information
bureaus
and
through
such
humanitarian
relief
as
was
provided
in
the
maternity
and
infancy
legislation
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
report
that
a
more
general
condition
of
contentment
exists
among
wage
earners
and
the
country
is
more
free
from
labor
disputes
than
it
has
been
for
years
while
restrictive
immigration
has
been
adopted
in
part
for
the
benefit
of
the
wage
earner
and
in
its
entirety
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
it
ought
not
to
cause
a
needless
separation
of
families
and
dependents
from
their
natural
source
of
support
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
humanity
bituminous

no
progress
appears
to
have
been
made
within
large
areas
of
the
bituminous

industry
toward
creation
of
voluntary

by
which
greater
assurance
can
be
given
to
the

of
peaceful

of

such
as

this

is
one

bears
a
great
responsibility

executive
in
protection
of
the
public
i
again
recommend
the
passage
of
such
legislation
as
will
assist
the
executive
in
dealing
with
such
emergencies
through
a
special
temporary
board
of
conciliation
and
mediation
and
through
administrative
agencies
for
the
purpose
of
distribution
of
coal
and
protection
of
the
consumers
of
coal
from
profiteering
at
present
the
executive
is
not
only
without
authority
to
act
but
is
actually
prohibited
by
law
from
making
any
expenditure
to
meet
the
emergency
of
a
coal
famine
judiciary
the
federal
courts
hold
a
high
position
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
world
while
individual
judicial
officers
have
sometimes
been
subjected
to
just
criticism
the
courts
as
a
whole
have
maintained
an
exceedingly
high
standard
the
congress
may
well
consider
the
question
of
supplying
fair
salaries
and
conferring
upon
the
supreme
court
the
same
rulemaking
power
on
the
law
side
of
the
district
courts
that
they
have
always
possessed
on
the
equity
side
a
bill
is
also
pending
providing
for
retirement
after
a
certain
number
of
years
of
service
although
they
have
not
been
consecutive
which
should
have
your
favorable
consideration
these
faithful
servants
of
the
government
are
about
the
last
that
remain
to
be
provided
for
in
the
postwar
readjustments
banking
there
has
been
pending
in
congress
for
nearly
three
years
banking
legislation
to
clarify
the
national
bank
act
and
reasonably
to
increase
the
powers
of
the
national
banks
i
believe
that
within
the
limitation
of
sound
banking
principles
congress
should
now
and
for
the
future
place
the
national
banks
upon
a
fair
equality
with
their
competitors
the
state
banks
and
i
trust
that
means
may
be
found
so
that
the
differences
on
branchbanking
legislation
between
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
may
be
settled
along
sound
lines
and
the
legislation
promptly
enacted
it
would
be
difficult
to
overestimate
the
service
which
the
federal
reserve
system
has
already
rendered
to
the
country
it
is
necessary
only
to
recall
the
chaotic
condition
of
our
banking
organization
at
the
time
the
federal
reserve
system
was
put
into
operation
the
old
system
consisted
of
a
vast
number
of
independent
banking
units
with
scattered
bank
reserves
which
never
could
be
mobilized
in
times
of
greatest
need
in
spite
of
vast
banking
resources
there
was
no
coordination
of
reserves
or
any
credit
elasticity
as
a
consequence
a
strain
was
felt
even
during
cropmoving
periods
and
when
it
was
necessary
to
meet
other
seasonal
and
regularly
recurring
needs
the
federal
reserve
system
is
not
a
panacea
for
all
economic
or
financial
ills
it
can
not
prevent
depression
in
certain
industries
which
are
experiencing
overexpansion
of
production
or
contraction
of
their
markets
its
business
is
to
furnish
adequate
credit
and
currency
facilities
this
it
has
succeeded
in
doing
both
during
the
war
and
in
the
more
difficult
period
of
deflation
and
readjustment
which
followed
it
enables
us
to
look
to
the
future
with
confidence
and
to
make
plans
far
ahead
based
on
the
belief
that
the
federal
reserve
system
will
exercise
a
steadying
influence
on
credit
conditions
and
thereby
prevent
tiny
sudden
or
severe
reactions
from
the
period
of
prosperity
which
we
are
now
enjoying
in
order
that
these
plans
may
go
forward
action
should
be
taken
at
the
present
session
on
the
question
of
renewing
the
banks
charters
and
thereby
insuring
a
continuation
of
the
policies
and
present
usefulness
of
the
federal
reserve
system
federal
regulation
i
am
in
favor
of
reducing
rather
than
expanding
government
bureaus
which
seek
to
regulate
and
control
the
business
activities
of
the
people
everyone
is
aware
that
abuses
exist
and
will
exist
so
long
as
we
are
limited
by
human
imperfections
unfortunately
human
nature
can
not
be
changed
by
an
act
of
the
legislature
when
practically
the
sole
remedy
for
many
evils
lies
in
the
necessity
of
the
people
looking
out
for
themselves
and
reforming
their
own
abuses
they
will
find
that
they
are
relying
on
a
false
security
if
the
government
assumes
to
hold
out
the
promise
that
it
is
looking
out
for
them
and
providing
reforms
for
them
this
principle
is
preeminently
applicable
to
the
national
government
it
is
too
much
assumed
that
because
an
abuse
exists
it
is
the
business
of
the
national
government
to
provide
a
remedy
the
presumption
should
be
that
it
is
the
business
of
local
and
state
governments
such
national
action
results
in
encroaching
upon
the
salutary
independence
of
the
states
and
by
undertaking
to
supersede
their
natural
authority
fills
the
land
with
bureaus
and
departments
which
are
undertaking
to
do
what
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
accomplish
and
brings
our
whole
system
of
government
into
disrespect
and
disfavor
we
ought
to
maintain
high
standards
we
ought
to
punish
wrongdoing
society
has
not
only
the
privilege
but
the
absolute
duty
of
protecting
itself
and
its
individuals
but
we
can
not
accomplish
this
end
by
adopting
a
wrong
method
permanent
success
lies
in
local
rather
than
national
action
unless
the
locality
rises
to
its
own
requirements
there
is
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
for
the
national
government
to
intervene
the
states
and
the
nation
should
both
realize
that
such
action
is
to
be
adopted
only
as
a
last
resort
the
negro
the
social
wellbeing
of
our
country
requires
our
constant
effort
for
the
amelioration
of
race
prejudice
and
the
extension
to
all
elements
of
equal
opportunity
and
equal
protection
under
the
laws
which
are
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
the
federal
government
especially
is
charged
with
this
obligation
in
behalf
of
the
colored
people
of
the
nation
not
only
their
remarkable
progress
their
devotion
and
their
loyalty
but
our
duty
to
ourselves
under
our
claim
that
we
are
an
enlightened
people
requires
us
to
use
all
our
power
to
protect
them
from
the
crime
of
lynching
although
violence
of
this
kind
has
very
much
decreased
while
any
of
it
remains
we
can
not
justify
neglecting
to
make
every
effort
to
eradicate
it
by
law
the
education
of
the
colored
race
under
government
encouragement
is
proceeding
successfully
and
ought
to
have
continuing
support
an
increasing
need
exists
for
properly
educated
and
trained
medical
skill
to
be
devoted
to
the
service
of
this
race
insular
possessions
this
government
holds
in
sacred
trusteeship
islands
which
it
has
acquired
in
the
east
and
west
indies
in
all
of
them
the
people
are
more
prosperous
than
at
any
previous
time
a
system
of
good
roads
education
and
general
development
is
in
progress
the
people
are
better
governed
than
ever
before
and
generally
content
in
the
philippine
islands
maj
gen
leonard
wood
has
been
governor
general
for
five
years
and
has
administered
his
office
with
tact
and
ability
greatly
to
the
success
of
the
filipino
people
these
are
a
proud
and
sensitive
race
who
are
making
such
progress
with
our
cooperation
that
we
can
view
the
results
of
this
experiment
with
great
satisfaction
as
we
are
attempting
to
assist
this
race
toward
selfgovernment
we
should
look
upon
their
wishes
with
great
respect
granting
their
requests
immediately
when
they
are
right
yet
maintaining
a
frank
firmness
in
refusing
when
they
are
wrong
we
shall
measure
their
progress
in
no
small
part
by
their
acceptance
of
the
terms
of
the
organic
law
under
which
the
islands
are
governed
and
their
faithful
observance
of
its
provisions
need
exists
for
clarifying
the
duties
of

the
auditor
and
declaring
them
to
be
what
everyone
had
supposed
they
were
we
have
placed
our
own
expenditures
under
the
supervision
of
the
comptroller
general
it
is
not
likely
that
the
expenditures
in
the
philippine
islands
need
less
supervision
than
our
own
the
governor
general
is
hampered
in
his
selection
of
subordinates
by
the
necessity
of
securing
a
confirmation
which
has
oftentimes
driven
him
to
the
expediency
of
using
army
officers
in
work
for
which
civilian
experts
would
be
much
better
fitted
means
should
be
provided
for
this
and
such
other
purposes
as
he
may
require
out
of
the
revenue
which
this
government
now
turns
back
to
the
philippine
treasury
in
order
that
these
possessions
might
stiffer
no
seeming
neglect
i
have
recently
sent
col
carmi
a
thompson
to
the
islands
to
make
a
survey
in
cooperation
with
the
governor
general
to
suggest
what
might
be
done
to
improve
conditions
later
i
may
make
a
more
extended
report
including
recommendations
the
economic
development
of
the
islands
is
very
important
they
ought
not
to
be
turned
back
to
the
people
until
they
are
both
politically
fitted
for
selfgovernment
and
economically
independent
large
areas
are
adaptable
to
the
production
of
rubber
no
one
contemplates
any
time
in
the
future
either
under
the
present
or
a
more
independent
form
of
government
when
we
should
not
assume
some
responsibility
for
their
defense
for
their
economic
advantage
for
the
employment
of
their
people
and
as
a
contribution
to
our
power
of
defense
which
could
not
be
carried
on
without
rubber
i
believe
this
industry
should
be
encouraged
it
is
especially
adapted
to
the
filipino
people
themselves
who
might
cultivate
it
individually
on
a
small
acreage
it
could
be
carried
on
extensively
by
american
capital
in
a
way
to
furnish
employment
at
good
wages
i
am
opposed
to
the
promotion
of
any
policy
that
does
not
provide
for
absolute
freedom
on
the
part
of
the
wage
earners
and
do
not
think
we
should
undertake
to
give
power
for
large
holdings
of
land
in
the
islands
against
the
opposition
of
the
people
of
the
locality
any
development
of
the
islands
must
be
solely
with
the
first
object
of
benefiting
the
people
of
the
islands
at
an
early
day
these
possessions
should
be
taken
out
from
under
all
military
control
and
administered
entirely
on
the
civil
side
of
government
national
defense
our
policy
of
national
defense
is
not
one
of
making
war
but
of
insuring
peace
the
land
and
sea
force
of
america
both
in
its
domestic
and
foreign
implications
is
distinctly
a
peace
force
it
is
an
arm
of
the
police
power
to
guarantee
order
and
the
execution
of
the
law
at
home
and
security
to
our
citizens
abroad
no
selfrespecting
nation
would
neglect
to
provide
an
army
and
navy
proportionate
to
its
population
the
extent
of
its
territory
and
the
dignity
of
the
place
which
it
occupies
in
the
world
when
it
is
considered
that
no
navy
in
the
world
with
one
exception
approaches
ours
and
none
surpasses
it
that
our
regular
army
of
about
men
is
the
equal
of
any
other
like
number
of
troops
that
our
entire
permanent
and
reserve
land
and
sea
force
trained
and
training
consists
of
a
personnel
of
about
and
that
our
annual
appropriations
are
about
a
year
expended
under
the
direction
of
an
exceedingly
competent
staff
it
can
not
be
said
that
our
country
is
neglecting
its
national
defense
it
is
true
that
a
cult
of
disparagement
exists
but
that
candid
examination
made
by
the
congress
through
its
various
committees
has
always
reassured
the
country
and
demonstrated
that
it
is
maintaining
the
most
adequate
defensive
forces
in
these
present
years
that
it
has
ever
supported
in
time
of
peace
this
general
policy
should
be
kept
in
effect
here
and
there
temporary
changes
may
be
made
in
personnel
to
meet
requirements
in
other
directions
attention
should
be
given
to
submarines
cruisers
and
air
forces
particular
points
may
need
strengthening
but
as
a
whole
our
military
power
is
sufficient
the
one
weak
place
in
the
whole
line
is
our
still
stupendous
war
debt
in
any
modern
campaign
the
dollars
are
the
shock
troops
with
a
depleted
treasury
in
the
rear
no
army
can
maintain
itself
in
the
field
a
country
loaded
with
debt
is
a
country
devoid
of
the
first
line
of
defense
economy
is
the
handmaid
of
preparedness
if
we
wish
to
be
able
to
defend
ourselves
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
in
the
future
we
shall
discharge
as
soon
as
possible
the
financial
burden
of
the
last
war
otherwise
we
would
face
a
crisis
with
a
part
of
our
capital
resources
already
expended
the
amount
and
kind
of
our
military
equipment
is
preeminently
a
question
for
the
decision
of
the
congress
after
giving
due
consideration
to
the
advice
of
military
experts
and
the
available
public
revenue
nothing
is
more
laudable
than
the
cooperation
of
the
agricultural
and
industrial
resources
of
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
the
needs
of
national
defense
in
time
of
peril
the
people
employed
in
these
interests
volunteered
in
a
most
selfsacrificing
way
often
at
the
nominal
charge
of
a
dollar
a
year
but
the
army
and
navy
are
not
supported
for
the
benefit
of
supply
concerns
supply
concerns
are
supported
for
the
benefit
of
the
army
and
navy
the
distribution
of
orders
on
what
is
needed
from
different
concerns
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
up
equipment
and
organization
is
perfectly
justified
but
any
attempt
to
prevail
upon
the
government
to
purchase
beyond
its
needs
ought
not
to
be
tolerated
it
is
eminently
fair
that
those
who
deal
with
the
government
should
do
so
at
a
reasonable
profit
however
public
money
is
expended
not
that
some
one
may
profit
by
it
but
in
order
to
serve
a
public
purpose
while
our
policy
of
national
defense
will
proceed
in
order
that
we
may
be
independent
and
selfsufficient
i
am
opposed
to
engaging
in
any
attempt
at
competitive
armaments
no
matter
how
much
or
how
little
some
other
country
may
feel
constrained
to
provide
we
can
well
afford
to
set
the
example
not
of
being
dictated
to
by
others
but
of
adopting
our
own
standards
we
are
strong
enough
to
pursue
that
method
which
will
be
a
most
wholesome
model
for
the
rest
of
the
world
we
are
eminently
peaceful
but
we
are
by
no
means
weak
while
we
submit
our
differences
with
others
not
to
the
adjudication
of
force
but
of
reason
it
is
not
because
we
are
unable
to
defend
our
rights
while
we
are
doing
our
best
to
eliminate
all
resort
to
war
for
the
purpose
of
settling
disputes
we
can
not
but
remember
that
the
peace
we
now
enjoy
had
to
be
won
by
the
sword
and
that
if
the
rights
of
our
country
are
to
be
defended
we
can
not
rely
for
that
purpose
upon
anyone
but
ourselves
we
can
not
shirk
the
responsibility
which
is
the
first
requisite
of
all
government
of
preserving
its
own
integrity
and
maintaining
the
rights
of
its
own
citizens
it
is
only
in
accordance
with
these
principles
that
we
can
establish
any
lasting
foundations
for
an
honorable
and
permanent
peace
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
our
country
like
any
other
country
proposes
to
provide
itself
with
an
army
and
navy
supported
by
a
merchant
marine
yet
these
are
not
for
competition
with
any
other
power
for
years
we
have
besought
nations
to
disarm
we
have
recently
expressed
our
willingness
at
geneva
to
enter
into
treaties
for
the
limitation
of
all
types
of
warships
according
to
the
ratio
adopted
at
the
washington
conference
this
offer
is
still
pending
while
we
are
and
shall
continue
to
be
armed
it
is
not
as
a
menace
but
rather
a
common
assurance
of
tranquility
to
all
the
peaceloving
people
of
the
world
for
us
to
do
any
less
would
be
to
disregard
our
obligations
evade
our
responsibilities
and
jeopardize
our
national
honor
veterans
this
country
not
only
because
it
is
bound
by
honor
but
because
of
the
satisfaction
derived
from
it
has
always
lavished
its
bounty
upon
its
veterans
for
years
a
service
pension
has
been
bestowed
upon
the
grand
army
on
reaching
a
certain
age
like
provision
has
been
made
for
the
survivors
of
the
spanish
war
a
liberal
future
compensation
has
been
granted
to
all
the
veterans
of
the
world
war
but
it
is
in
the
case
of
the
disabled
and
the
dependents
that
the
government
exhibits
its
greatest
solicitude
this
work
is
being
well
administered
by
the
veterans
bureau
the
main
unfinished
feature
is
that
of
hospitalization
this
requirement
is
being
rapidly
met
various
veteran
bodies
will
present
to
you
recommendations
which
should
have
your
careful
consideration
at
the
last
session
we
increased
our
annual
expenditure
for
pensions
and
relief
on
account
of
the
veterans
of
three
wars
while
i
approve
of
proper
relief
for
all
suffering
i
do
not
favor
any
further
extension
of
our

we
still
have
in

the
alien
property
it
has
always
been
the
policy
of
america
to
hold
that
private
enemy
property
should
not
be
confiscated
in
time
of
war
this
principle
we
have
scrupulously
observed
as
this
property
is
security
for
the
claims
of
our
citizens
and
our
government
we
can
not
relinquish
it
without
adequate
provision

reimbursement

the
return
of
this
property
accompanied
by
suitable
provisions
for
the
liquidation
of
the
claims

releases

prohibition
the

of

have
made

the
law
of
the
land
acting
under
the

the
congress
and
the
legislatures
of
practically
all
the
states
have
adopted
legislation
for
its
enforcement
some
abuses
have
arisen
which
require
reform
under

the
national

has
entrusted
to
the
treasury
department
the
especial
duty
of
regulation
and
enforcement
such
supplementary
legislation
as
it
requires
to
meet
existing
conditions
should
be
carefully
and
speedily
enacted
failure
to
support
the
constitution
and
observe
the

ought
not
to
be
tolerated
by
public
opinion
especially
those
in
public
places
who
have
taken
the
ir
oath
to
support
the
constitution
ought
to
be
most
scrupulous
in
its
observance
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
throughout
the
country
should
be
vigilant
in
enforcing
the
law
but
local
authorities
which
had
always
been
mainly
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
law
in
relation
to
intoxicating
liquor
ought
not
to
seek
evasion
by
attempting
to
shift
the
burden
wholly
upon
the
federal
agencies
under

constitution
the

are

some

do
not
like
the
amendment
some
do
not
like
other
parts
of

some
do
not
like
any
of
it
those
who
entertain
such
sentiments
have
a
perfect
right
to
seek
through
legal
methods
for
a
change
but
for
any
of
our
inhabitants
to
observe
such
parts
of
the
constitution
as
they
like
while
disregarding
others
is
a
doctrine
that
would
break
down
all
protection
of
life
and
property
and
destroy
the
american
system
of
ordered
liberty
foreign
relations
the
foreign
policy
of
this
government
is
well
known
it
is
one
of
peace
based
on
that
mutual
respect
that
arises
from
mutual
regard
for
international
rights
and
the
discharge
of
international
obligations
it
is
our
purpose
to
promote
understanding
and
good
will
between
ourselves
and
all
other
people
the
american
people
are
altogether
lacking
in
an
appreciation
of
the
tremendous
good
fortune
that
surrounds
their
international
position
we
have
no
traditional
enemies
we
are
not
embarrassed
over
any
disputed
territory
we
have
no
possessions
that
are
coveted
by
others
they
have
none
that
are
coveted
by
us
our
borders
are
unfortified
we
fear
no
one
no
one
fears
us
all
the
world
knows
that
the
whole
extent
of
our
influence
is
against
war
and
in
favor
of
peace
against
the
use
of
force
and
in
favor
of
negotiation
arbitration
and
adjudication
as
a
method
of
adjusting
international
differences
we
look
with
disfavor
upon
all
aggressive
warfare
we
are
strong
enough
so
that
no
one
can
charge
us
with
weakness
if
we
are
slow
to
anger
our
place
is
sufficiently
established
so
that
we
need
not
be
sensitive
over
trifles
our
resources
are
large
enough
so
that
we
can
afford
to
be
generous
at
the
same
time
we
are
a
nation
among
nations
and
recognize
a
responsibility
not
only
to
ourselves
but
in
the
interests
of
a
stable
and
enlightened
civilization
to
protect
and
defend
the
international
rights
of
our
government
and
our
citizens
it
is
because
of
our
historical
detachment
and
the
generations
of
comparative
indifference
toward
it
by
other
nations
that
our
public
is
inclined
to
consider
altogether
too
seriously
the
reports
that
we
are
criticized
abroad
we
never
had
a
larger
foreign
trade
than
at
the
present
time
our
good
offices
were
never
more
sought
and
the
necessity
for
our
assistance
and
cooperation
was
never
more
universally
declared
in
any
time
of
peace
we
know
that
the
sentiments
which
we
entertain
toward
all
other
nations
are
those
of
the
most
sincere
friendship
and
good
will
and
of
all
unbounded
desire
to
help
which
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
have
judged
by
their
fruits
in
our
efforts
to
adjust
our
international
obligations
we
have
met
with
a
response
which
when
everything
is
considered
i
believe
history
will
record
as
a
most
remarkable
and
gratifying
demonstration
of
the
sanctity
with
which
civilized
nations
undertake
to
discharge
their
mutual
obligations
debt
settlements
have
been
negotiated
with
practically
all
of
those
who
owed
us
and
all
finally
adjusted
but
two
which
are
in
process
of
ratification
when
we
consider
the
real
sacrifice
that
will
be
necessary
on
the
part
of
other
nations
considering
all
their
circumstances
to
meet
their
agreed
payments
we
ought
to
hold
them
in
increased
admiration
and
respect
it
is
true
that
we
have
extended
to
them
very
generous
treatment
but
it
is
also
true
that
they
have
agreed
to
repay
its
all
that
we
loaned
to
them
and
some
interest
a
special
conference
on
the
chinese
customs
tariff
provided
for
by
the
treaty
between
the
nine
powers
relating
to
the
chinese
customs
tariff
signed
at
washington
on
february
was
called
by
the
chinese
government
to
meet
at
peking
on
october
we
participated
in
this
conference
through
fully
empowered
delegates
and
with
good
will
endeavored
to
cooperate
with
the
other
participating
powers
with
a
view
to
putting
into
effect
promises
made
to
china
at
the
washington
conference
and
considering
any
reasonable
proposal
that
might
be
made
by
the
chinese
government
for
the
revision
of
the
treaties
on
the
subject
of
chinas
tariff
with
these
aims
in
view
the
american
delegation
at
the
outset
of
the
conference
proposed
to
put
into
effect
the
surtaxes
provided
for
by
the
washington
treaty
and
to
proceed
immediately
to
the
negotiation
of
a
treaty
which
among
other
things
was
to
make
provision
for
the
abolition
of
taxes
collected
on
goods
in
transit
remove
the
tariff
restrictions
in
existing
treaties
and
put
into
effect
the
national
tariff
law
of
china
early
in
april
of
the
present
year
the
central
chinese
government
was
ousted
from
power
by
opposing
warring
factions
it
became
impossible
under
the
circumstances
to
continue
the
negotiations
finally
on
july
the
delegates
of
the
foreign
powers
including
those
of
the
united
states
issued
a
statement
expressing
their
unanimous
and
earnest
desire
to
proceed
with
the
work
of
the
conference
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
when
the
delegates
of
the
chinese
government
are
in
a
position
to
resume
discussions
with
the
foreign
delegates
of
the
problems
before
the
conference
we
are
prepared
to
resume
the
negotiations
thus
interrupted
whenever
a
government
representing
the
chinese
people
and
acting
on
their
behalf
presents
itself
the
fact
that
constant
warfare
between
contending
chinese
factions
has
rendered
it
impossible
to
bring
these
negotiations
to
a
successful
conclusion
is
a
matter
of
deep
regret
throughout
these
conflicts
we
have
maintained
a
position
of
the
most
careful
neutrality
our
naval
vessels
in
asiatic
waters
pursuant
to
treaty
rights
have
been
used
only
for
the
protection
of
american
citizens
silas
h
strawn
esq
was
sent
to
china
as
american
commissioner
to
cooperate
with
commissioners
of
the
other
powers
in
the
establishment
of
a
commission
to
inquire
into
the
present
practice
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
in
china
with
a
view
to
reporting
to
the
governments
of
the
several
powers
their
findings
of
fact
in
regard
to
these
matters
the
commission
commenced
its
work
in
january
and
agreed
upon
a
joint
report
which
was
signed
on
september
the
commissions
report
has
been
received
and
is
being
studied
with
a
view
to
determining
our
future
policy
in
regard
to
the
question
of
extraterritorial
privileges
under
treaties
between
the
united
states
and
china
the
preparatory
commission
for
the
disarmament
conference
met
at
geneva
on
may
and
its
work
has
been
proceeding
almost
continuously
since
that
date
it
would
be
premature
to
attempt
to
form
a
judgment
as
to
the
progress
that
has
been
made
the
commission
has
had
before
it
a
comprehensive
list
of
questions
touching
upon
all
aspects
of
the
question
of
the
limitation
of
armament
in
the
commissions
discussions
many
differences
of
opinion
have
developed
however
i
am
hopeful
that
at
least
some
measure
of
agreement
will
be
reached
as
the
discussions
continue
the
american
representation
on
the
commission
has
consistently
tried
to
be
helpful
and
has
kept
before
it
the
practical
objective
to
which
the
commission
is
working
namely
actual
agreements
for
the
limitation
of
armaments
our
representatives
will
continue
their
work
in
that
direction
one
of
the
most
encouraging
features
of
the
commissions
work
thus
far
has
been
the
agreement
in
principle
among
the
naval
experts
of
a
majority
of
the
powers
parties
to
the
washington
treaty
limiting
naval
armament
upon
methods
and
standards
for
the
comparison
and
further
limitation
of
naval
armament
it
is
needless
to
say
that
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
be
prepared
to
proceed
along
practical
lines
to
the
conclusion
of
agreements
carrying
further
the
work
begun
at
the
washington
conference
in
department
reports
many
important
subjects
which
it
is
impossible
even
to
mention
in
the
short
space
of
an
annual
message
you
will
find
fully
discussed
in
the
departmental
reports
a
failure
to
include
them
here
is
not
to
be
taken
as
indicating
any
lack
of
interest
but
only
a
disinclination
to
state
inadequately
what
has
been
much
better
done
in
other
documents
the
capital
city
we
are
embarking
on
an
ambitious
building
program
for
the
city
of
washington
the
memorial
bridge
is
under
way
with
all
that
it
holds
for
use
and
beauty
new
buildings
are
soon
contemplated
this
program
should
represent
the
best
that
exists
in
the
art
and
science
of
architecture
into
these
structures
which
must
be
considered
as
of
a
permanent
nature
ought
to
go
the
aspirations
of
the
nation
its
ideals
expressed
in
forms
of
beauty
if
our
country
wishes
to
compete
with
others
let
it
not
be
in
the
support
of
armaments
but
in
the
making
of
a
beautiful
capital
city
let
it
express
the
soul
of
america
whenever
an
american
is
at
the
seat
of
his
government
however
traveled
and
cultured
he
may
be
he
ought
to
find
a
city
of
stately
proportion
symmetrically
laid
out
and
adorned
with
the
best
that
there
is
in
architecture
which
would
arouse
his
imagination
and
stir
his
patriotic
pride
in
the
coming
years
washington
should
be
not
only
the
art
center
of
our
own
country
but
the
art
center
of
the
world
around
it
should
center
all
that
is
best
in
science
in
learning
in
letters
and
in
art
these
are
the
results
that
justify
the
creation
of
those
national
resources
with
which
we
have
been
favored
american
ideals
america
is
not
and
must
not
be
a
country
without
ideals
they
are
useless
if
they
are
only
visionary
they
are
only
valuable
if
they
are
practical
a
nation
can
not
dwell
constantly
on
the
mountain
tops
it
has
to
be
replenished
and
sustained
through
the
ceaseless
toil
of
the
less
inspiring
valleys
but
its
face
ought
always
to
be
turne
d
upward
its
vision
ought
always
to
be
fixed
on
high
we
need
ideals
that
can
be
followed
in
daily
life
that
can
be
translated
into
terms
of
the
home
we
can
not
expect
to
be
relieved
from
toil
but
we
do
expect
to
divest
it
of
degrading
conditions
work
is
honorable
it
is
entitled
to
an
honorable
recompense
we
must
strive
mightily
but
having
striven
there
is
a
defect
in
our
political
and
social
system
if
we
are
not
in
general
rewarded
with
success
to
relieve
the
land
of
the
burdens
that
came
from
the
war
to
release
to
the
individual
more
of
the
fruits
of
his
own
industry
to
increase
his
earning
capacity
and
decrease
his
hours
of
labor
to
enlarge
the
circle
of
his
vision
through
good
roads
and
better
transportation
to
lace
before
him
the
opportunity
for
education
both
in
science
and
in
art
to
leave
him
free
to
receive
the
inspiration
of
religion
all
these
are
ideals
which
deliver
him
from
the
servitude
of
the
body
and
exalt
him
to
the
service
of
the
soul
through
this
emancipation
from
the
things
that
are
material
we
broaden
our
dominion
over
the
things
that
are
spiritual

members
of
the
congress
in
meeting
the
constitutional
requirement
of
informing
the
congress
upon
the
state
of
the
union
it
is
exceedingly
gratifying
to
report
that
the
general
condition
is
one
of
progress
and
prosperity
here
and
there
are
comparatively
small
and
apparently
temporary
difficulties
needing
adjustment
and
improved
administrative
methods
such
as
are
always
to
be
expected
but
in
the
fundamentals
of
government
and
business
the
results
demonstrate
that
we
are
going
in
the
right
direction
the
country
does
not
appear
to
require
radical
departures
from
the
policies
already
adopted
so
much
as
it
needs
a
further
extension
of
these
policies
and
the
improvement
of
details
the
age
of
perfection
is
still
in
the
somewhat
distant
future
but
it
is
more
in
danger
of
being
retarded
by
mistaken
government
activity
than
it
is
from
lack
of
legislation
we
are
by
far
the
most
likely
to
accomplish
permanent
good
if
we
proceed
with
moderation
in
our
country
the
people
are
sovereign
and
independent
and
must
accept
the
resulting
responsibilities
it
is
their
duty
to
support
themselves
and
support
the
government
that
is
the
business
of
the
nation
whatever
the
charity
of
the
nation
may
require
the
functions
which
the
congress
are
to
discharge
are
not
those
of
local
government
but
of
national
government
the
greatest
solicitude
should
be
exercised
to
prevent
any
encroachment
upon
the
rights
of
the
states
or
their
various
political
subdivisions
local
selfgovernment
is
one
of
our
most
precious
possessions
it
is
the
greatest
contributing
factor
to
the
stability
strength
liberty
and
progress
of
the
nation
it
ought
not
to
be
in
ringed
by
assault
or
undermined
by
purchase
it
ought
not
to
abdicate
its
power
through
weakness
or
resign
its
authority
through
favor
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
because
abuses
exist
it
is
the
concern
of
the
federal
government
to
attempt
the
r
reform
society
is
in
much
more
danger
from
encumbering
the
national
government
beyond
its
wisdom
to
comprehend
or
its
ability
to
administer
than
from
leaving
the
local
communities
to
bear
their
own
burdens
and
remedy
their
own
evils
our
local
habit
and
custom
is
so
strong
our
variety
of
race
and
creed
is
so
great
the
federal
authority
is
so
tenuous
that
the
area
within
which
it
can
function
successfully
is
very
limited
the
wiser
policy
is
to
leave
the
localities
so
far
as
we
can
possessed
of
their
own
sources
of
revenue
and
charged
with
their
own
obligations
government
economy
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
country
that
the
people
are
sovereign
while
they
recognize
the
undeniable
authority
of
the
state
they
have
established
as
its
instrument
a
government
of
limited
powers
they
hold
inviolate
in
their
own
hands
the
jurisdiction
over
their
own
freedom
and
the
ownership
of
their
own
property
neither
of
these
can
be
impaired
except
by
due
process
of
law
the
wealth
of
our
country
is
not
public
wealth
but
private
wealth
it
does
not
belong
to
the
government
it
belongs
to
the
people
the
government
has
no
justification
in
taking
private
property
except
for
a
public
purpose
it
is
always
necessary
to
keep
these
principles
in
mind
in
the
laying
of
taxes
and
in
the
making
of
appropriations
no
right
exists
to
levy
on
a
dollar
or
to
order
the
expenditure
of
a
dollar
of
the
money
of
the
people
except
for
a
necessary
public
purpose
duly
authorized
by
the
constitution
the
power
over
the
purse
is
the
power
over
liberty
that
is
the
legal
limitation
within
which
the
congress
can
act
how
it
will
proceed
within
this
limitation
is
always
a
question
of
policy
when
the
country
is
prosperous
and
free
from
debt
when
the
rate
of
taxation
is
low
opportunity
exists
for
assuming
new
burdens
and
undertaking
new
enterprises
such
a
condition
now
prevails
only
to
a
limited
extent
all
proposals
for
assuming
new
obligations
ought
to
be
postponed
unless
they
are
reproductive
capital
investments
or
are
such
as
are
absolutely
necessary
at
this
time
we
still
have
an
enormous
debt
of
over
on
which
the
interest
and
sinkingfund
requirements
are
our
appropriations
for
the
pension
office
and
the
veterans
bureau
are
the
war
and
navy
departments
call
for
other
requirements
exclusive
of
the
post
office
which
is
virtually
selfsustaining
brought
the
appropriations
for
the
current
year
up
to
almost
this
shows
an
expenditure
of
close
to
for
every
inhabitant
of
our
country
for
the
average
family
of
five
it
means
a
tax
directly
or
indirectly
paid
of
about
for
national
purposes
alone
the
local
tax
adds
much
more
these
enormous
expenditures
ought
not
to
be
increased
but
through
every
possible
effort
they
ought
to
be
reduced
only
one
of
these
great
items
can
be
ultimately
extinguished
that
is
the
item
of
our
war
debt
already
this
has
been
reduced
to
about
which
means
an
annual
saving
in
interest
of
close
to
the
present
interest
charge
is
about
yearly
it
would
seem
to
be
obvious
that
the
sooner
this
debt
can
be
retired
the
more
the
taxpayers
will
save
in
interest
and
the
easier
it
will
be
to
secure
funds
with
which
to
prosecute
needed
running
expenses
constructions
and
improvements
this
item
of
for
interest
is
a
heavy
charge
on
all
the
people
of
the
country
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
might
well
consider
whether
it
is
not
greatly
worth
while
to
dispense
with
it
as
early
as
possible
by
retiring
the
principal
debt
which
it
is
required
to
serve
it
has
always
been
our
policy
to
retire
our
debts
that
of
the
revolutionary
war
period
notwithstanding
the
additions
made
in
was
paid
by
and
the
civil
war
debt
within
years
of
the
amount
already
paid
over
is
a
reduction
in
cash
balances
that
source
is
exhausted
over
one
and
twothirds
billions
of
dollars
was
derived
from
excess
receipts
tax
reduction
eliminates
that
the
sale
of
surplus
war
materials
has
been
another
element
of
our
income
that
is
practically
finished
with
these
eliminated
the
reduction
of
the
debt
has
been
only
about
each
year
not
an
excessive
sum
on
so
large
a
debt
proposals
have
been
made
to
extend
the
payment
over
a
period
of
years
if
is
paid
at
the
end
of
years
the
cost
to
the
taxpayers
is
the
principal
and
if
the
interest
is
per
cent
a
total
of
if
the
same
sum
is
paid
at
the
end
of
years
the
cost
is
or
almost
double
here
is
another
consideration
compared
with
its
purchasing
power
in
the
dollar
we
borrowed
represented
but
cents
as
the
value
of
our
dollar
increases
due
to
the
falling
prices
of
commodities
the
burden
of
our
debt
increases
it
has
now
risen
to
cents
the
taxpayer
will
be
required
to
produce
nearly
twice
the
amount
of
commodities
to
pay
his
debt
if
the
dollar
returns
to
the
value
the
more
we
pay
while
prices
are
high
the
easier
it
will
be
deflation
of
government
after
a
war
period
is
slower
than
deflation
of
business
where
curtailment
is
either
prompt
and
effective
or
disaster
follows
there
is
room
for
further
economy
in
the
cost
of
the
federal
government
but
a
co
n
of
current
expenditures
with
prewar
expenditures
is
not
able
to
the
efficiency
with
which
government
business
is
now
being
done
the
expenditures
of
the
last
prewar
year
were
and
in
over
or
nearly
five
times
as
great
if
we
subtract
expenditures
for
debt
retirements
and
interest
veterans
relief
increase
of
pensions
and
other
special
outlays
consisting
of
refunds
trust
investments
and
like
charges
we
find
that
the
general
expenditures
of
the
government
in
were
slightly
more
than
twice
as
large
as
in
as
prices
in
were
approximately
per
cent
higher
than
in
the
cost
of
the
same
government
must
also
have
increased
but
the
government
is
not
the
same
it
is
more
expensive
to
collect
the
much
greater
revenue
necessary
and
to
administer
our
great
debt
we
have
given
enlarged
and
improved
services
to
agriculture
and
commerce
above
all
america
has
grown
in
population
and
wealth
government
expenditures
must
always
share
in
this
growth
taking
into
account
the
factors
i
have
mentioned
i
believe
that
present
federal
expenses
are
not
far
out
of
line
with
prewar
expenses
we
have
nearly
accomplished
the
deflation
this
does
not
mean
that
further
economies
will
not
come
as
we
reduce
our
debt
our
interest
charges
decline
there
are
many
details
yet
to
correct
the
real
improvement
however
must
come
not
from
additional
curtailment
of
expenses
but
by
a
more
intelligent
more
ordered
spending
our
economy
must
be
constructive
while
we
should
avoid
as
far
as
possible
increases
in
permanent
current
expenditures
oftentimes
a
capital
outlay
like
internal
improvements
will
result
in
actual
constructive
saving
that
is
economy
in
its
best
sense
it
is
an
avoidance
of
waste
that
there
may
be
the
means
for
an
outlay
today
which
will
bring
larger
returns
tomorrow
we
should
constantly
engage
in
scientific
studies
of
our
future
requirements
and
adopt
an
orderly
program
for
their
service
economy
is
the
method
by
which
we
prepare
today
to
afford
the
improvements
of
tomorrow
a
mere
policy
of
economy
without
any
instrumentalities
for
putting
it
into
operation
would
be
very
ineffective
the
congress
has
wisely
set
up
the
bureau
of
the
budget
to
investigate
and
inform
the
president
what
recommendations
he
ought
to
make
for
current
appropriations
this
gives
a
centralized
authority
where
a
general
and
comprehensive
understanding
can
be
reached
of
the
sources
of
income
and
the
most
equitable
distribution
of
expenditures
how
well
it
has
worked
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
departmental
estimates
for
before
the
budget
law
were
while
the
budget
estimates
for
are
this
latter
figure
shows
the
reductions
in
departmental
estimates
for
the
coming
year
made
possible
by
the
operation
of
the
budget
system
that
the
congress
has
provided
but
it
is
evidently
not
enough
to
have
care
in
making
appropriations
without
any
restraint
upon
expenditure
the
congress
has
provided
that
check
by
establishing
the
office
of
comptroller
general
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
budget
director
and
the
comptroller
general
is
to
secure
economy
and
efficiency
in
government
expenditure
no
better
method
has
been
devised
for
the
accomplishment
of
that
end
these
offices
can
not
b
e
administered
in
all
the
various
details
without
making
some
errors
both
of
fact
and
of
judgment
but
the
important
consideration
remains
that
these
are
the
instrumentalities
of
the
congress
and
that
no
other
plan
has
ever
been
adopted
which
was
so
successful
in
promoting
economy
and
efficiency
the
congress
has
absolute
authority
over
the
appropriations
and
is
free
to
exercise
its
judgment
as
the
evidence
may
warrant
in
increasing
or
decreasing
budget
recommendations
but
it
ought
to
resist
every
effort
to
weaken
or
break
down
this
most
beneficial
system
of
supervising
appropriations
and
expenditures
without
it
all
the
claim
of
economy
would
be
a
mere
pretense
taxation
the
purpose
of
reducing
expenditures
is
to
secure
a
reduction
in
taxes
that
purpose
is
about
to
be
realized
with
commendable
promptness
the
ways
and
means
committee
of
the
house
has
undertaken
in
advance
of
the
meeting
of
the
congress
to
frame
a
revenue
act
as
the
bill
has
proceeded
through
the
committee
it
has
taken
on
a
nonpartisan
character
and
both
republicans
and
democrats
have
joined
in
a
measure
which
embodies
many
sound
principles
of
tax
reform
the
bill
will
correct
substantially
the
economic
defects
injected
into
the
revenue
act
of
as
well
as
many
which
have
remained
as
wartime
legacies
in
its
present
form
it
should
provide
sufficient
revenue
for
the
government
the
excessive
surtaxes
have
been
reduced
estate
tax
rates
are
restored
to
more
reasonable
figures
with
every
prospect
of
withdrawing
from
the
field
when
the
states
have
had
the
opportunity
to
correct
the
abuses
in
their
own
inheritance
tax
laws
the
gift
tax
and
publicity
section
are
to
be
repealed
many
miscellaneous
taxes
are
lowered
or
abandoned
and
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
the
administrative
features
of
the
law
are
improved
and
strengthened
i
approve
of
the
bill
in
principle
in
so
far
as
incometax
exemptions
are
concerned
it
seems
to
me
the
committee
has
gone
as
far
as
it
is
safe
to
go
and
somewhat
further
than
i
should
have
gone
any
further
extension
along
these
lines
would
in
my
opinion
impair
the
integrity
of
our
incometax
system
i
am
advised
that
the
bill
will
be
through
the
house
by
christmas
for
this
prompt
action
the
country
call
thank
the
good
sense
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
in
framing
an
economic
measure
upon
economic
considerations
if
this
attitude
continues
to
be
reflected
through
the
congress
the
taxpayer
will
have
his
relief
by
the
time
his
march
th
installment
of
income
taxes
is
due
nonpartisan
effort
means
certain
quick
action
determination
of
a
revenue
law
definitely
promptly
and
solely
as
a
revenue
law
is
one
of
the
greatest
gifts
a
legislature
can
bestow
upon
its
constituents
i
commend
the
example
of
file
ways
and
means
committee
if
followed
it
will
place
sound
legislation
upon
the
books
in
time
to
give
the
taxpayers
the
full
benefit
of
tax
reduction
next
year
this
means
that
the
bill
should
reach
me
prior
to
march
all
these
economic
results
are
being
sought
not
to
benefit
the
rich
but
to
benefit
the
people
they
are
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
industry
in
order
that
employment
may
be
plentiful
they
seek
to
make
business
good
in
order
that
wages
may
be
good
they
encourage
prosperity
in
order
that
poverty
may
be
banished
from
the
home
they
seek
to
lay
the
foundation
which
through
increased
production
may
give
the
people
a
more
bountiful
supply
of
the
necessaries
of
life
afford
more
leisure
for
the
improvement
of
the
mind
the
appreciation
of
the
arts
of

and
literature
sculpture
and

and
the
beneficial
enjoyment
of
outdoor
sports
and
recreation
enlarge
the
resources
which
minister
to
charity
and
by
all
these
means
attempting
to
strengthen
the
spiritual
life
of
the
nation
foreign
relations
the
policy
of
our
foreign
relations
casting
aside
any
suggestion
of
force
rests
solely
on
the
foundation
of
peace
good
will
and
good
works
we
have
sought
in
our
intercourse
with
other
nations
better
understandings
through
conference
and
exchange
of
views
its
befits
beings
endowed
with
reason
the
results
have
been
the
gradual
elimination
of
disputes
the
settlement
of
controversies
and
the
establishment
of
a
firmer
friendship
between
america
and
the
rest
of
the
world
that
has
ever
existed
tit
any
previous
time
the
example
of
this
attitude
has
not
been
without
its
influence
upon
other
countries
acting
upon
it
an
adjustment
was
made
of
the
difficult
problem
of
reparations
this
was
the
second
step
toward
peace
in
europe
it
paved
the
way
for
the
agreements
which
were
drawn
up
at
the
locarno
conference
when
ratified
these
will
represent
the
third
step
toward
peace
while
they
do
not
of
themselves
provide
an
economic
rehabilitation
which
is
necessary
for
the
progress
of
europe
by
strengthening
the
guarantees
of
peace
they
diminish
the
need
for
great
armaments
if
the
energy
which
now
goes
into
military
effort
is
transferred
to
productive
endeavor
it
will
greatly
assist
economic
progress
the
locarno
agreements
were
made
by
the
european
countries
directly
interested
without
any
formal
intervention
of
america
although
on
july
i
publicly
advocated
such
agreements
in
an
address
made
in
massachusetts
we
have
consistently
refrained
from
intervening
except
when
our
help
has
been
sought
and
we
have
felt
it
could
be
effectively
given
as
in
the
settlement
of
reparations
and
the
london
conference
these
recent
locarno
agreements
represent
the
success
of
this
policy
which
we
have
been
insisting
ought
to
be
adopted
of
having
european
countries
settle
their
own
political
problems
without
involving
this
country
this
beginning
seems
to
demonstrate
that
this
policy
is
sound
it
is
exceedingly
gratifying
to
observe
this
progress
both
in
its
method
and
in
its
result
promises
so
much
that
is
beneficial
to
the
world
when
these
agreements
are
finally
adopted
they
will
provide
guarantees
of
peace
that
make
the
present
prime
reliance
upon
force
in
some
parts
of
europe
very
much
less
necessary
the
natural
corollary
to
these
treaties
should
be
further
international
contracts
for
the
limitation
of
armaments
this
work
was
successfully
begun
at
the
washington
conference
nothing
was
done
at
that
time
concerning
land
forces
because
of
european
objection
our
standing
army
has
been
reduced
to
around
about
the
necessary
police
force
for
people
we
are
not
proposing
to
increase
it
nor
is
it
supposable
that
any
foreign
country
looks
with
the
slightest
misapprehension
upon
our
land
forces
they
do
not
menace
anybody
they
are
rather
a
protection
to
everybody
the
question
of
disarming
upon
land
is
so
peculiarly
european
in
its
practical
aspects
that
our
country
would
look
with
particular
gratitude
upon
any
action
which
those
countries
might
take
to
reduce
their
own
military
forces
this
is
in
accordance
with
our
policy
of
not
intervening
unless
the
european
powers
are
unable
to
agree
and
make
request
for
our
assistance
whenever
they
are
able
to
agree
of
their
own
accord
it
is
especially
gratifying
to
its
and
such
agreements
may
be
sure
of
our
sympathetic
support
it
seems
clear
that
it
is
the
reduction
of
armies
rather
than
of
navies
that
is
of
the
first
importance
to
the
world
at
the
present
time
we
shall
look
with
great
satisfaction
upon
that
effort
and
give
it
our
approbation
and
encouragement
if
that
can
be
settled
we
may
more
easily
consider
further
reduction
and
limitation
of
naval
armaments
for
that
purpose
our
country
has
constantly
through
its
executive
and
through
repeated
acts
of
congress
indicated
its
willingness
to
call
such
a
conference
under
congressional
sanction
it
would
seem
to
be
wise
to
participate
in
any
conference
of
the
great
powers
for
naval
limitation
of
armament
proposed
upon
such
conditions
that
it
would
hold
a
fair
promise
of
being
effective
the
general
policy
of
our
country
is
for
disarmament
and
it
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
adopt
any
practical
plan
that
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
succeed
but
it
would
not
care
to
attend
a
conference
which
from
its
location
or
constituency
would
in
all
probability
prove
futile
in
the
further
pursuit
of
strengthening
the
bonds
of
peace
and
good
will
we
have
joined
with
other
nations
in
an
international
conference
held
at
geneva
and
signed
an
agreement
which
will
be
laid
before
the
senate
for
ratification
providing
suitable
measures
for
control
and
for
publicity
in
international
trade
in
arms
ammunition
and
implements
of
war
and
also
executed
a
protocol
providing
for
a
prohibition
of
the
use
of
poison
gas
in
war
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
article
of
the
treaty
relating
thereto
signed
at
the
washington
conference
we
are
supporting
the
pan
american
efforts
that
are
being
made
toward
the
codification
of
international
law
and
looking
with
sympathy
oil
the
investigations
conducted
under
philanthropic
auspices
of
the
proposal
to
agreements
outlawing
war
in
accordance
with
promises
made
at
the
washington
conference
we
have
urged
the
calling
of
and
are
now
represented
at
the
chinese
customs
conference
and
on
the
commission
on
extraterritoriality
where
it
will
be
our
policy
so
far
as
possible
to
meet
the
aspirations
of
china
in
all
ways
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
countries
involved
court
of
international
justice
pending
before
the
senate
for
nearly
three
years
is
the
proposal
to
adhere
to
the
protocol
establishing
the
permanent
court
of
international
justice
a
wellestablished
line
of
precedents
mark
americas
effort
to
effect
the
establishment
of
it
court
of
this
nature
we
took
a
leading
part
in
laying
the
foundation
on
which
it
rests
in
the
establishment
of
the
hague
court
of
arbitration
it
is
that
tribunal
which
nominates
the
judges
who
are
elected
by
the
council
and
assembly
of
the
league
of
nations
the
proposal
submitted
to
the
senate
was
made
dependent
upon
four
conditions
the
first
of
which
is
that
by
supporting
the
court
we
do
not
assume
any
obligations
under
the
league
second
that
we
may
participate
upon
an
equality
with
other
states
in
the
election
of
judges
third
that
the
congress
shall
determine
what
part
of
the
expenses
we

shall
bear
fourth
that
the
statute
creating
the
court
shall
not
be
amended
without
out
consent
and
to
these
i
have
proposed
an
additional
condition
to
the
effect
that
we
are
not
to
be
bound
by
advisory
opinions
rendered
without
our
consent
the
court
appears
to
be
independent
of
the
league
it
is
true
the
judges
are
elected
by
the
assembly
and
council
but
they
are
nominated
by
the
court
of
arbitration
which
we
assisted
to
create
and
of
which
we
are
a
part
the
court
was
created
by
it
statute
socalled
which
is
really
a
treaty
made
among
some
fortyeight
different
countries
that
might
properly
be
called
a
constitution
of
the
court
this
statute
provides
a
method
by
which
the
judges
are
chosen
so
that
when
the
court
of
arbitration
nominates
them
and
the
assembly
and
council
of
the
league
elect
them
they
are
not
acting
as
instruments
of
the
court
of
arbitration
or
instruments
of
the
league
but
as
instruments
of
the
statute
this
will
be
even
more
apparent
if
our
representatives
sit
with
the
members
of
the
council
and
assembly
in
electing
the
judges
it
is
true
they
are
paid
through
the
league
though
not
by
the
league
but
by
the
countries
which
are
members
of
the
league
and
by
our
country
if
we
accept
the
protocol
the
judges
are
paid
by
the
league
only
in
the
same
sense
that
it
could
be
said
united
states
judges
are
paid
by
the
congress
the
court
derives
all
its
authority
from
the
statute
and
is
so
completely
independent
of
the
league
that
it
could
go
on
functioning
if
the
league
were
disbanded
at
least
until
the
terms
of
the
judges
expired
the
most
careful
provisions
are
made
in
the
statute
as
to
the
qualifications
of
judges
those
who
make
the
nominations
are
recommended
to
consult
with
their
highest
court
of
justice
their
law
schools
and
academies
the
judges
must
be
persons
of
high
moral
character
qualified
to
hold
the
highest
judicial
offices
in
that
country
or
be
jurisconsults
of
recognized
competence
in
international
law
it
must
be
assumed
that
these
requirements
will
continue
to
be
carefully
met
and
with
america
joining
the
countries
already
concerned
it
is
difficult
to
comprehend
how
human
ingenuity
could
better
provide
for
the
establishment
of
a
court
which
would
maintain
its
independence
it
has
to
be
recognized
that
independence
is
to
a
considerable
extent
a
matter
of
ability
character
and
personality
some
effort
was
made
in
the
early
beginnings
to
interfere
with
the
independence
of
our
supreme
court
it
did
not
succeed
because
of
the
quality
of
the
men
who
made
up
that
tribunal
it
does
not
seem
that
the
authority
to
give
advisory
opinions
interferes
with
the
independence
of
the
court
advisory
opinions
in
and
of
themselves
are
not
harmful
but
may
be
used
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
very
beneficial
because
they
undertake
to
prevent
injury
rather
than
merely
afford
a
remedy
after
the
injury
has
been
done
as
a
principle
that
only
implies
that
the
court
shall
function
when
proper
application
is
made
to
it
deciding
the
question
involved
upon
issues
submitted
for
an
advisory
opinion
does
not
differ
materially
from
deciding
the
question
involved
upon
issues
submitted
by
contending
parties
up
to
the
present
time
the
court
has
given
an
advisory
opinion
when
it
judged
it
had
jurisdiction
and
refused
to
give
one
when
it
judged
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
nothing
in
the
work
of
the
court
has
yet
been
an
indication
that
this
is
an
impairment
of
its
independence
or
that
its
practice
differs
materially
from
the
giving
of
like
opinions
under
the
authority
of
the
constitutions
of
several
of
our
states
no
provision
of
the
statute
seems
to
me
to
give
this
court
any
authority
to
be
a
political
rather
than
a
judicial
court
we
have
brought
cases
in
this
country
before
our
courts
which
when
they
have
been
adjudged
to
be
political
have
been
thereby
dismissed
it
is
not
improbable
that
political
questions
will
be
submitted
to
this
court
but
again
up
to
the
present
time
the
court
has
refused
to
pass
on
political
questions
and
our
support
would
undoubtedly
have
a
tendency
to
strengthen
it
in
that
refusal
we
are
not
proposing
to
subject
ourselves
to
any
compulsory
jurisdiction
if
we
support
the
court
we
can
never
be
obliged
to
submit
any
case
which
involves
our
interests
for
its
decision
our
appearance
before
it
would
always
be
voluntary
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
a
case
which
we
had
agreed
might
be
presented
there
is
no
more
danger
that
others
might
bring
cases
before
the
court
involving
our
interests
which
we
did
not
wish
to
have
brought
after
we
have
adhered
and
probably
not
so
much
than
there
would
be
of
bringing
such
cases
if
we
do
not
adhere
i
think
that
we
would
have
the
same
legal
or
moral
right
to
disregard
such
a
finding
in
the
one
case
that
we
would
in
the
other
if
we
are
going
to
support
any
court
it
will
not
be
one
that
we
have
set
up
alone
or
which
reflects
only
our
ideals
other
nations
have
their
customs
and
their
institutions
their
thoughts
and
their
methods
of
life
if
a
court
is
going
to
be
international
its
composition
will
have
to
yield
to
what
is
good
in
all
these
various
elements
neither
will
it
be
possible
to
support
a
court
which
is
exactly
perfect
or
under
which
we
assume
absolutely
no
obligations
if
we
are
seeking
that
opportunity
we
might
as
well
declare
that
we
are
opposed
to
supporting
any
court
if
any
agreement
is
made
it
will
be
because
it
undertakes
to
set
up
a
tribunal
which
can
do
some
of
the
things
that
other
nations
wish
to
have
done
we
shall
not
find
ourselves
bearing
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
worlds
burdens
by
our
adherence
and
we
may
as
well
remember
that
there
is
absolutely
no
escape
for
our
country
from
bearing
its
share
of
the
worlds
burdens
in
any
case
we
shall
do
far
better
service
to
ourselves
and
to
others
if
we
admit
this
and
discharge
our
duties
voluntarily
than
if
we
deny
it
and
are
forced
to
meet
the
same
obligations
unwillingly
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
anything
that
would
be
more
helpful
to
the
world
than
stability
tranquility
and
international
justice
we
may
say
that
we
are
contributing
to
these
factors
independently
but
others
less
fortunately
located
do
not
and
can
not
make
a
like
contribution
except
through
mutual
cooperation
the
old
balance
of
power
mutual
alliances
and
great
military
forces
were
not
brought
bout
by
any
mutual
dislike
for
independence
but
resulted
from
the
domination
of
circumstances
ultimately
they
were
forced
on
us
like
all
others
engaged
in
the
war
whatever
we
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
joined
an
alliance
we
became
a
military
power
we
impaired
our
independence
we
have
more
at
stake
than
any
one
else
in
avoiding
a
repetition
of
that
calamity
wars
do
not
spring
into
existence
they
arise
from
small
incidents
and
trifling
irritations
which
can
be
adjusted
by
an
international
court
we
can
contribute
greatly
to
the
advancement
of
our
ideals
by
joining
with
other
nations
in
maintaining
such
a
tribunal
foreign
debts
gradually
settlements
have
been
made
which
provide
for
the
liquidation
of
debts
due
to
our
government
from
foreign
governments
those
made
with
great
britain
finland
hungary
lithuania
and
poland
have
already
been
approved
by
the
congress
since
the
adjournment
further
agreements
have
been
entered
into
with
belgium
czechoslovakia
latvia
estonia
italy
and
rumania
these
nations
which
have
already
made
settlements
represent
of
the
original
principal
of
the
loans
the
principal
sums
without
interest
still
pending
are
the
debt
of
france
of
greece
yugoslavia
liberia
russia
which
those
at
present
in
control
have
undertaken
openly
to
repudiate
nicaragua
which
is
being
paid
currently
and
austria
on
which
by
act
of
congress
a
moratorium
of
years
has
been
granted
the
only
remaining
sum
is
due
from
armenia
which
has
now
ceased
to
exist
as
an
independent
nation
in
accordance
with
the
settlements
made
the
amount
of
principal
and
interest
which
is
to
be
paid
to
the
united
states
under
these
agreements
aggregate
it
is
obvious
that
the
remaining
settlements
which
will
undoubtedly
be
made
will
bring
this
sum
up
to
an
amount
which
will
more
than
equal
the
principal
due
on
our
present
national
debt
while
these
settlements
are
very
large
in
the
aggregate
it
has
been
felt
that
the
terms
granted
were
in
all
cases
very
generous
they
impose
no
undue
burden
and
are
mutually
beneficial
in
the
observance
of
international
faith
and
the
improvement
of
international
credit
every
reasonable
effort
will
be
made
to
secure
agreements
for
liquidation
with
the
remaining
countries
whenever
they
are
in
such
condition
that
they
can
be
made
those
which
have
already
been
negotiated
under
the
bipartisan
commission
established
by
the
congress
have
been
made
only
after
the
most
thoroughgoing
and
painstaking
investigation
continued
for
a
long
time
before
meeting
with
the
representatives
of
the
countries
concerned
it
is
believed
that
they
represent
in
each
instance
the
best
that
can
be
done
and
the
wisest
settlement
that
can
be
secured
one
very
important
result
is
the
stabilization
of
foreign
currency
making
exchange
assist
rather
than
embarrass
our
trade
wherever
sacrifices
have
been
made
of
money
it
will
be
more
than
amply
returned
in
better
understanding
and
friendship
while
in
so
far
as
these
adjustments
will
contribute
to
the
financial
stability
of
the
debtor
countries
to
their
good
order
prosperity
and
progress
they
represent
hope
of
improved
trade
relations
and
mutual
contributions
to
the
civilization
of
the
world
alien
problem
negotiations
are
progressing
among
the
interested
parties
in
relation
to
the
final
distribution
of
the
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
alien
property
custodian
our
government
and

are
interested

the
german
government
and

are

of
the

property
pending
the
outcome
of
these
negotiations
i
do
not
recommend
any
affirmative
legislation
for
the
present
we
should
continue
in

of
this
property
which
we
hold
as
security
for
the

of
claims
due
to
our
people
and
our

immigration
while
not
enough
ti
me
has
elapsed
to
afford
a
conclusive
demonstration
such
results
as
have
been
secured
indicate
that
our
immigration
law
is
on
the
whole
beneficial
it
is
undoubtedly
a
protection
to
the
wage
earners
of
this
country
the
situation
should
however
be
carefully
surveyed
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
it
is
working
a
needless
hardship
upon
our
own
inhabitants
if
it
deprives
them
of
the
comfort
and
society
of
those
bound
to
them
by
close
family
ties
such
modifications
should
be
adopted
as
will
afford
relief
always
in
accordance
with
the
principle
that
our
government
owes
its
first
duty
to
our
own
people
and
that
no
alien
inhabitant
of
another
country
has
any
legal
rights
whatever
under
our
constitution
and
laws
it
is
only
through
treaty
or
through
residence
here
that
such
rights
accrue
but
we
should
not
however
be
forgetful
of
the
obligations
of
a
common
humanity
while
our
country
numbers
among
its
best
citizens
many
of
those
of
foreign
birth
yet
those
who
now
enter
in
violation
of
our
laws
by
that
very
act
thereby
place
themselves
in
a
class
of
undesirables
investigation
reveals
that
any
considerable
number
are
coming
here
in
defiance
of
our
immigration
restrictions
it
will
undoubtedly
create
the
necessity
for
the
registration
of
all
aliens
we
ought
to
have
no
prejudice
against
an
alien
because
he
is
an
alien
the
standard
which
we
apply
to
our
inhabitants
is
that
of
manhood
not
place
of
birth
restrictive
immigration
is
to
a
large
degree
for
economic
purposes
it
is
applied
in
order
that
we
may
not
have
a
larger
annual
increment
of
good
people
within
our
borders
than
we
can
weave
into
our
economic
fabric
in
such
a
way
as
to
supply
their
needs
without
undue
injury
to
ourselves
national
defense
never
before
in
time
of
peace
has
our
country
maintained
so
large
and
effective
a
military
force
as
it
now
has
the
army
navy
marine
corps
national
guard
and
organized
reserves
represent
a
strength
of
about
men
these
forces
are
well
trained
well
equipped
and
high
in
morale
a
sound
selective
service
act
giving
broad
authority
for
the
mobilization
in
time
of
peril
of
all
the
resources
of
the
country
both
persons
and

is
needed
to
perfect
our

in

with
our
ideals

derived
from
the

of
excess

work
is
going
forward
in
modernizing
the
older
ones
building
aircraft
carriers
additional
fleet

and
fast
scout
cruisers
but
we
are
carefully
avoiding
anything
that
might
be
construed
as
a
competition
in
armaments
with
other
nations
the
joint
army
and
navy
maneuvers
at
hawaii
followed
by
the
cruise
of
a
full
battle
fleet
to
australia
and
new
zealand
were
successfully
carried
out
these
demonstrations
revealed
a
most
satisfactory
condition
of
the
ships
and
the
men
engaged
last
year
at
my
suggestion
the
general
board
of
the
navy
made
an
investigation
and
report
on
the
relation
of
aircraft
to
warships
as
a
result
authorizations
and
appropriations
were
made
for
more
scout
cruisers
and
fleet
submarines
and
for
completing
aircraft
carriers
and
equipping
them
with
necessary
planes
additional
training
in
aviation
was
begun
at
the
military
and
naval
academies
a
method
of
coordination
and
cooperation
of
the
army
and
navy
and
the
principal
aircraft
builders
is
being
perfected
at
the
suggestion
of
the
secretaries
of
war
and
navy
i
appointed
a
special
board
to
make
a
further
study
of
the
problem
of
aircraft
the
report
of
the
air
board
ought
to
be
reassuring
to
the
country
gratifying
to
the
service
and
satisfactory
to
the
congress
it
is
thoroughly
complete
and
represents
the
mature
thought
of
the
best
talent
in
the
country
no
radical
change
in
organization
of
the
service
seems
necessary
the
departments
of
war
navy
and
commerce
should
each
be
provided
with
an
additional
assistant
secretary
not
necessarily
with
statutory
duties
but
who
would
be
available
under
the
direction
of
the
secretary
to
give
especial
attention
to
air
navigation
we
must
have
an
air
strength
worthy
of
america
provision
should
be
made
for
two
additional
brigadier
generals
for
the
army
air
service
temporary
rank
corresponding
to
their
duties
should
be
awarded
to
active
flying
officers
in
both
army
and
navy
aviation
is
of
great
importance
both
for
national
defense
and
commercial
development
we
ought
to
proceed
in
its
improvement
by
the
necessary
experiment
and
investigation
our
country
is
not
behind
in
this
art
it
has
made
records
for
speed
and
for
the
excellence
of
its
planes
it
ought
to
go
on
maintaining
its
manufacturing
plants
capable
of
rapid
production
giving
national
assistance
to
the
la
in
out
of
airways
equipping
itself
with
a
moderate
number
of
planes
and
keeping
an
air
force
trained
to
the
highest
efficiency
while
i
am
a
thorough
believer
in
national
defense
and
entirely
committed
to
the
policy
of
adequate
preparation
i
am
just
as
thoroughly
opposed
to
instigating
or
participating
in
a
policy
of
competitive
armaments
nor
does
preparation
mean
a
policy
of
militarizing
our
people
and
industries
are
solicitous
for
the
cause
of
country
and
have
great
respect
for
the
army
and
navy
and
foil
the
uniform
worn
by
the
men
who
stand
ready
at
all
times
for
our
protection
to
encounter
the
dangers
and
perils
necessary
to
military
service
but
all
of
these
activities
are
to
be
taken
not
in
behalf
of
aggression
but
in
behalf
of
peace
they
are
the
instruments
by
which
we
undertake
to
do
our
part
to
promote
good
will
and
support
stability
among
all
peoples
veterans
if
any
one
desires
to
estimate
the
esteem
in
which
the
veterans
of
america
are
held
by
their
fellow
citizens
it
is
but
necessary
to
remember
that
the
current
budget
calls
for
an
expenditure
of
about
in
their
behalf
this
is
nearly
the
amount
of
the
total
cost
of
the
national
government
exclusive
of
the
post
office
before
we
entered
the
last
war
at
the
two
previous
sessions
of
congress
legislation
affecting
veterans
relief
was
enacted
and
the
law
liberalized
this
legislation
brought
into
being
a
number
of
new
provisions
tending
more
nearly
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
veterans
as
well
as
afford
the
necessary
authority
to
perfect
the
administration
of
these
laws
experience
with
the
new
legislation
so
far
has
clearly
demonstrated
its
constructive
nature
it
has
increased
the
benefits
received
by
many
and
has
made
eligible
for
benefits
many
others
direct
disbursements
to
the
veteran
or
his
dependents
exceeding
have
resulted
which
otherwise
would
not
have
been
made
the
degree
of
utilization
of
our
hospitals
has
increased
through
making
facilities
available
to
the
incapacitated
veteran
regardless
of
service
origin
of
the
disability
this
new
legislation
also
has
brought
about
a
marked
improvement
of
service
to
the
veteran
the
organizations
of
exservice
men
have
proposed
additional
legislative
changes
which
you
will
consider
but
until
the
new
law
and
the
modifications
made
at
the
last
session
of
congress
are
given
a
more
thorough
test
further
changes
in
the
basic
law
should
be
few
and
made
only
after
careful
though
sympathetic
consideration
the
principal
work
now
before
the
veterans
bureau
is
the
perfection
of
its
organization
and
further
improvements
in
service
some
minor
legislative
changes
are
deemed
necessary
to
enable
the
bureau
to
retain
that
high
grade
of
professional
talent
essential
in
handling
the
problems
of
the
bureau
such
changes
as
tend
toward
the
improvement
of
service
and
the
carrying
forward
to
completion
of
the
hospital
construction
program
are
recommended
for
the
consideration
of
the
proper
committees
of
congress
with
the
enormous
outlay
that
is
now
being
made
in
behalf
of
the
veterans
and
their
dependents
with
a
tremendous
war
debt
still
requiring
great
annual
expenditure
with
the
still
high
rate
of
taxation
while
every
provision
should
be
made
for
the
relief
of
the
disabled
and
the
necessary
care
of
dependents
the
congress
may
well
consider
whether
the
financial
condition
of
the
government
is
not
such
that
further
bounty
through
the
enlargement
of
general
pensions
and
other
emoluments
ought
not
to
be
postponed
agriculture
no
doubt
the
position
of
agriculture
as
a
whole
has
very
much
improved
since
the
depression
of
three
and
four
years
ago
but
there
are
many
localities
and
many
groups
of
individuals
apparently
through
no
fault
of
their
own
sometimes
due
to
climatic
conditions
and
sometimes
to
the
prevailing
price
of
a
certain
crop
still
in
a
distressing
condition
this
is
probably
temporary
but
it
is
none
the
less
acute
national
government
agencies
the
departments
of
agriculture
and
commerce
the
farm
loan
board
the
intermediate
credit
banks
and
the
federal
reserve
board
are
all
cooperating
to
be
of
assistance
and
relief
on
the
other
hand
there
are
localities
and
individuals
who
have
had
one
of
their
most
prosperous
years
the
general
price
level
is
fair
but
here
again
there
are
exceptions
both
ways
some
items
being
poor
while
others
are
excellent
in
spite
of
a
lessened
production
the
farm
income
for
this
year
will
be
about
the
same
as
last
year
and
much
above
the
three
preceding
years
agriculture
is
a
very
complex
industry
it
does
not
consist
of
one
problem
but
of
several
they
can
not
be
solved
at
one
stroke
they
have
to
be
met
in
different
ways
and
small
gains
are
not
to
be
despised
it
has
appeared
from
all
the
investigations
that
i
have
been
able
to
make
that
the
farmers
as
a
whole
are
determined
to
maintain
the
independence
of
their
business
they
do
not
wish
to
have
meddling
on
the
part
of
the
government
or
to
be
placed
under
the
inevitable
restrictions
involved
in
any
system
of
direct
or
indirect
pricefixing
which
would
result
from
permitting
the
government
to
operate
in
the
agricultural
markets
they
are
showing
a
very
commendable
skill
in
organizing
themselves
to
transact
their
own
business
thro
ugh
cooperative
marketing
which
will
this
year
turn
over
about
or
nearly
onefifth
of
the
total
agricultural
business
in
this
they
are
receiving
help
from
the
government
the
department
of
agriculture
should
be
strengthened
in
this
facility
in
order
to
be
able
to
respond
when
these
marketing
associations
want
help
while
it
ought
not
to
undertake
undue
regulation
it
should
be
equipped
to
give
prompt
information
on
crop
prospects
supply
demand
current
receipts
imports
exports
and
prices
a
bill
embodying
these
principles
which
has
been
drafted
under
the
advice
and
with
the
approval
of
substantially
all
the
leaders
and
managers
in
the
cooperative
movement
will
be
presented
to
the
congress
for
its
enactment
legislation
should
also
be
considered
to
provide
for
leasing
the
unappropriated
public
domain
for
grazing
purposes
and
adopting
a
uniform
policy
relative
to
grazing
on
the
public
lands
and
in
the
national
forests
a
more
intimate
relation
should
be
established
between
agriculture
and
the
other
business
activities
of
the
nation
they
are
mutually
dependent
and
can
each
advance
their
own
prosperity
most
by
advancing
the
prosperity
of
the
other
meantime
the
government
will
continue
those
activities
which
have
resulted
in
an
unprecedented
amount
of
legislation
and
the
pouring
out
of
great
sums
of
money
during
the
last
five
years
the
work
for
good
roads
better
land
and
water
transportation
increased
support
for
agricultural
education
extension
of
credit
facilities
through
the
farm
loan
boards
and
the
intermediate
credit
banks
the
encouragement
of
orderly
marketing
and
a
repression
of
wasteful
speculation
will
all
be
continued
following
every
other
depression
after
a
short
period
the
price
of
farm
produce
has
taken
and
maintained
the
lead
in
the
advance
this
advance
had
reached
a
climax
before
the
war
everyone
will
recall
the
discussion
that
went
on
for
four
or
five
years
prior
to
concerning
the
high
cost
of
living
this
history
is
apparently
beginning
to
repeat
itself
while
wholesale
prices
of
other
commodities
have
been
declining
farm
prices
have
been
increasing
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
a
new
era
in
agricultural
prosperity
lies
just
before
us
which
will
probably
be
unprecedented
muscle
shoals
the
problem
of
muscle
shoals
seems
to
me
to
have
assumed
a
place
all
out
of
proportion
with
its
real
importance
it
probably
does
not
represent
in
market
value
much
more
than
a
firstclass
battleship
yet
it
has
been
discussed
in
the
congress
over
a
period
of
years
and
for
months
at
a
time
it
ought
to
be
developed
for
the
production
of
nitrates
primarily
and
incidentally
for
power
purposes
this
would
serve
defensive
agricultural
and
industrial
purposes
i
am
in
favor
of
disposing
of
this
property
to
meet
these
purposes
the
findings
of
the
special
commission
will
be
transmitted
to
the
congress
for
their
information
i
am
convinced
that
the
best
possible
disposition
can
be
made
by
direct
authorization
of
the
congress
as
a
means
of
negotiation
i
recommend
the
immediate
appointment
of
a
small
joint
special
committee
chosen
from
the
appropriate
general
standing
committees
of
the
house
and
senate
to
receive
bids
which
when
made
should
be
reported
with
recommendations
as
to
acceptance
upon
which
a
law
should
be
enacted
effecting
a
sale
to
the
highest
bidder
who
will
agree
to
carry
out
these
purposes
if
anything
were
needed
to
demonstrate
the
almost
utter
incapacity
of
the
national
government
to
deal
directly
with
an
industrial
and
commercial
problem
it
has
been
provided
by
our
experience
with
this
property
we
have
expended
vast
fortunes
we
have
taxed
everybody
but
we
are
unable
to
secure
results
which
benefit
anybody
this
property
ought
to
be
transferred
to
private
management
under
conditions
which
will
dedicate
it
to
the
public
purpose
for
which
it
was
conceived
reclamation
the
national
government
is
committed
to
a
policy
of
reclamation
and
irrigation
which
it
desires
to
establish
on
a
sound
basis
and
continue
in
the
interest
of
the
localities
concerned
exhaustive
studies
have
recently
been
made
of
federal
reclamation
which
have
resulted
in
improving
the
projects
and
adjusting
many
difficulties
about
one
third
of
the
projects
is
in
good
financial
condition
another
third
can
probably
be
made
profitable
while
the
other
third
is
under
unfavorable
conditions
the
congress
has
already
provided
for
a
survey
which
will
soon
be
embodied
in
a
report
that
ought
to
suggest
a
method
of
relief
which
will
make
unnecessary
further
appeals
to
the
congress
unless
this
can
be
done
federal
reclamation
will
be
considerably
retarded
with
the
greatly
increased
cost
of
construction
and
operation
it
has
become
necessary
to
plan
in
advance
by
community
organization
and
selective
agriculture
methods
sufficient
to
repay
these
increasing
outlays
the
human
and
economic
interests
of
the
farmer
citizens
suggest
that
the
states
should
be
required
to
exert
some
effort
and
assume
some
responsibility
especially
in
the
intimate
detailed
and
difficult
work
of
securing
settlers
and
developing
farms
which
directly
profit
them
but
only
indirectly
and
remotely
can
reimburse
the
nation
it
is
believed
that
the
federal
government
should
continue
to
be
the
agency
for
planning
and
constructing
the
great
undertakings
needed
to
regulate
and
bring
into
use
the
rivers
the
west
many
of
which
are
interstate
in
character
but
the
detailed
work
of
creating
agricultural
communities
and
a
rural
civilization
on
the
land
made
ready
for
reclamation
ought
to
be
either
transferred
to
the
state
in
its
entirety
or
made
a
cooperative
effort
of
the
state
and
federal
government
shipping
the
maintenance
of
a
merchant
marine
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
national
defense
and
the
service
of
our
commerce
we
have
a
large
number
of
ships
engaged
in
that
service
we
also
have
a
surplus
supply
costly
to
care
for
which
ought
to
be
sold
all
the
investigations
that
have
been
made
under
my
direction
and
those
which
have
been
prosecuted
independently
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
fleet
should
be
under
the
direct
control
of
a
single
executive
head
while
the
shipping
board
should
exercise
its
judicial
and
regulatory
functions
in
accordance
with
its
original
conception
the
report
of
henry
g
dalton
a
business
man
of
broad
experience
with
a
knowledge
of
shipping
made
to
me
after
careful
investigation
will
be
transmitted
for
the
information
of
the
congress
the
studies
pursued
under
the
direction
of
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
will
also
be
accessible
and
added
to
these
will
be
the
report
of
the
special
committee
of
the
house
i
do
not
advocate
the
elimination
of
regional
considerations
but
it
has
become
apparent
that
without
centralized
executive
action
the
management
of
this
great
business
like
the
management
of
any
other
great
business
will
flounder
in
incapacity
and
languish
under
a
division
of
council
a
plain
and
unmistakable
reassertion
of
this
principle
of
unified
control
which
i
have
always
been
advised
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
apply
is
necessary
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
our
merchant
fleet
coal
the
perennial
conflict
in
the
coal
industry
is
still
going
on
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
wage
earners
the
owners
and
especially
to
the
public
with
deposits
of
coal
in
this
country
capable
of
supplying
its
needs
for
hundreds
of
years
inability
to
manage
and
control
this
great
resource
for
the
benefit
of
all
concerned
is
very
close
to
a
national
economic
failure
it
has
been
the
subject
of
repeated
investigation
and
reiterated
recommendation
yet
the
industry
seems
never
to
have
accepted
modern
methods
of
adjusting
differences
between
employers
and
employees
the
industry
could
serve
the
public
much
better
and
become
subject
to
a
much
more
effective
method
of
control
if
regional
consolidations
and
more
freedom
in
the
formation
of
marketing
associations
under
the
supervision
of
the
department
of
commerce
were
permitted
at
the
present
time
the
national
government
has
little
or
no
authority
to
deal
with
this
vital
necessity
of
the
life
of
the
country
it
has
permitted
itself
to
remain
so
powerless
that
its
only
attitude
must
be
humble
supplication
authority
should
be
lodged
with
the
president
and
the
departments
of
commerce
and
labor
giving
them
power
to
deal
with
an
emergency
they
should
be
able
to
appoint
temporary
boards
with
authority
to
call
for
witnesses
and
documents
conciliate
differences
encourage
arbitration
and
in
case
of
threatened
scarcity
exercise
control
over
distribution
making
the
facts
public
under
these
circumstances
through
a
statement
from
an
authoritative
source
would
be
of
great
public
benefit
the
report
of
the
last
coal
commission
should
be
brought
forward
reconsidered
and
acted
upon
prohibition
under
the
orderly
processes
of
our
fundamental
institutions
the
constitution
was
lately
amended
providing
for
national
prohibition
the
congress
passed
an
act
for
its
enforcement
and
similar
acts
have
been
provided
by
most
of
the
states
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
it
is
the
duty
of
all
who
come
under
its
jurisdiction
to
observe
the
spirit
of
that
law
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
treasury
department
to
enforce
it
action
to
prevent
smuggling
illegal
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
abuse
in
the
use
of
permits
and
existence
of
sources
of
supply
for
illegal
traffic
is
almost
entirely
imposed
upon
the
federal
government
through
treaties
with
foreign
governments
and
increased
activities
of
the
coast
guard
revenue
agents
district
attorneys
and
enforcement
agents
effort
is
being
made
to
prevent
these
violations
but
the
constitution
also
puts
a
concurrent
duty
on
the
states
we
need
their
active
and
energetic
cooperation
the
vigilant
action
of
their
police
and
the
jurisdiction
of
their
courts
to
assist
in
enforcement
i
request
of
the
people
observance
of
the
public
officers
continuing
efforts
for
enforcement
and
of
the
congress
favorable
action
on
the
budget
recommendation
for
the
prosecution
of
this
work
waterway
development
for
many
years
our
country
has

been
employed
in
plans
and
m
for
the
development
of
our
intracoastal
and
inland
waterways
this
work
along
our
coast
is
an
important
adjunct
to
our
commerce
it
will
be
carried
on
together
with
the
further
opening
up
of
our
harbors
as
our
resources
permit
the
government
made
an
agreement
during
the
war
to
take
over
the
cape
cod
canal
under
which
the
owners
made
valuable
concessions
this
pledged
faith
of
the
government
ought
to
be
redeemed
two
other
main
fields
are
under
consideration
one
is
the
great
lakes
and
st
lawrence
including
the
erie
canal
this
includes
stabilizing
the
lake
level
and
is
both
a
waterway
and
power
project
a
joint
commission
of
the
united
states
and
canada
is
working
on
plans
and
surveys
which
will
not
be
completed
until
next
april
no
final
determination
can
be
made
apparently
except
under
treaty
as
to
the
participation
of
both
countries
the
other
is
the
mississippi
river
stem
this
is
almost
entirely
devoted
to
navigation
work
on
the
ohio
river
will
be
completed
in
about
three
years
a
modern
channel
connecting
chicago
new
orleans
kansas
city
and
pittsburgh
should
be
laid
out
and
work
on
the
tributaries
prosecuted
some
work
is
being
done
of
a
preparatory
nature
along
the
missouri
and
large
expenditures
are
being
made
yearly
in
the
lower
reaches
of
the
mississippi
and
its
tributaries
which
contribute
both
to
flood
control
and
navigation
preliminary
measures
are
being
taken
on
the
colorado
river
project
which
is
exceedingly
important
for
flood
control
irrigation
power
development
and
water
supply
to
the
area
concerned
it
would
seem
to
be
very
doubtful
however
whether
it
is
practical
to
secure
affirmative
action
of
the
congress
except
under
a
joint
agreement
of
the
several
states
the
government
has
already
expended
large
sums
upon
scientific
research
and
engineering
investigation
in
promotion
of
this
colorado
river
project
the
actual
progress
has
been
retarded
for
many
years
by
differences
among
the
seven
states
in
the
basin
over
their
relative
water
rights
and
among
different
groups
as
to
methods
in
an
attempt
to
settle
the
primary
difficulty
of
the
water
rights
congress
authorized
the
colorado
river
commission
which
agreed
on
november
upon
an
interstate
compact
to
settle
these
rights
subject
to
the
ratification
of
the
state
legislatures
and
congress
all
seven
states
except
arizona
at
one
time
ratified
the
arizona
legislature
making
certain
reservations
which
failed
to
meet
the
approval
of
the
governor
subsequently
an
attempt
was
made
to
establish
the
compact
upon
a
sixstate
basis
but
in
this
case
california
imposed
reservations
there
appears
to
be
no
division
of
opinion
upon
the
major
principles
of
the
compact
but
difficulty
in
separating
contentions
to
methods
of
development
from
the
discussion
of
it
it
is
imperative
that
flood
control
be
undertaken
for
california
and
arizona
preparation
made
for
irrigation
for
power
and
for
domestic
water
some
or
all
of
these
questions
are
combined
in
every
proposed
development
the
federal
government
is
interested
in
some
of
these
phases
state
governments
and
municipalities
and
irrigation
districts
in
others
and
private
corporations
in
still
others
because
of
all
this
difference
of
view
it
is
most
desirable
that
congress
should
consider
the
creation
of
some
agency
that
will
be
able
to
determine
methods
of
improvement
solely
upon
economic
and
engineering
facts
that
would
be
authorized
to
negotiate
and
settle
subject
to
the
approval
of
congress
the
participation
rights
and
obligations
of
each
group
in
any
particular
works
only
by
some
such
method
can
early
construction
be
secured
water
power
along
with
the
development
of
navigation
should
go
every
possible
encouragement
for
the
development
of
our
water
power
while
steam
still
plays
a
dominant
part
this
is
more
and
more
becoming
an
era
of
electricity
once
installed
the
cost
is
moderate
has
not
tended
greatly
to
increase
and
is
entirely
free
from
the
unavoidable
dirt
and
disagreeable
features
attendant
upon
the
burning
of

every
facility
should
be
extended
for
the
connection
of
the
various
units
into
a
superpower
plant
capable
at
all
times
of
a
current
increasing
uniformity
over
the
entire
system
railroads
the
railroads
throughout
the
country
are
in
a
fair
state
of
prosperity
their
service
is
good
and
their
supply
of
cars
is
abundant
their
condition
would
be
improved
and
the
public
better
served
by
a
system
of
consolidations
i
recommend
that
the
congress
authorize
such
consolidations
tinder
the
supervision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
with
power
to
approve
or
disapprove
when
proposed
parts
are
excluded
or
new
parts
added
i
am
informed
that
the
railroad
managers
and
their
employees
have
reached
a
substantial
agreement
as
to
what
legislation
is
necessary
to
regulate
and
improve
their
relationship
whenever
they
bring
forward
such
proposals
which
seem
sufficient
also
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
public
they
should
be
enacted
into
law
it
is
gratifying
to
report
that
both
the
railroad
managers
and
railroad
employees
are
providing
boards
for
the
mutual
adjustment
of
differences
in
harmony
with
the
principles
of
conference
conciliation
and
arbitration
the
solution
of
their
problems
ought
to
be
an
example
to
all
other
industries
those
who
ask
the
protections
of
civilization
should
be
ready
to
use
the
methods
of
civilization
a
strike
in
modern
industry
has
many
of
the
aspects
of
war
in
the
modern
world
it
injures
labor
and
it
injures
capital
if
the
industry
involved
is
a
basic
one
it
reduces
the
necessary
economic
surplus
and
increasing
the
cost
of
living
it
injures
the
economic
welfare
and
general
comfort
of
the
whole
people
it
also
involves
a
deeper
cost
it
tends
to
embitter
and
divide
the
community
into
warring
classes
and
thus
weakens
the
unity
and
power
of
our
national
life
labor
can
make
no
permanent
gains
at
the
cost
of
the
general
welfare
all
the
victories
won
by
organized
labor
in
the
past
generation
have
been
won
through
the
support
of
public
opinion
the
manifest
inclination
of
the
managers
and
employees
of
the
railroads
to
adopt
a
policy
of
action
in
harmony
with
these
principles
marks
a
new
epoch
in
our
industrial
life
outlying
possessions
the
time
has
come
for
careful
investigation
of
the
expenditures
and
success
of
the
laws
by
which
we
have
undertaken
to
administer
our
outlying
possessions
a
very
large
amount
of
money
is
being
expended
for
administration
in
alaska
it
appears
so
far
out
of
proportion
to
the
number
of
inhabitants
and
the
amount
of
production
as
to
indicate
cause
for
thorough
investigation
likewise
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
experience
under
the
law
which
governs
the
philippines
from
such
reports
as
reach
me
there
are
indications
that
more
authority
should
be
given
to
the
governor
general
so
that
he
will
not
be
so
dependent
upon
the
local
legislative
body
to
render
effective
our
efforts
to
set
an
example
of
the
sound
administration
and
good
government
which
is
so
necessary
for
the
preparation
of
the
philippine
people
for
selfgovernment
under
ultimate
independence
if
they
are
to
be
trained
in
these
arts
it
is
our
duty
to
provide
for
them
the
best
that
there
is
retirement
of
judges
the
act
of
march
ought
to
be
amended
so
that
the
term
of
years
of
service
of
judges
of
any
court
of
the
united
states
requisite
for
retirement
with
pay
shall
be
computed
to
include
not
only
continuous
but
aggregate
service
mothers
aid
the
government
ought
always
to
be
alert
on
the
side
of
the
humanities
it
ought
to
encourage
provisions
for
economic
justice
for
the
defenseless
it
ought
to
extend
its
relief
through
its
national
and
local
agencies
as
may
be
appropriate
in
each
case
to
the
suffering
and
the
needy
it
ought
to
be
charitable
although
more
than
of
our
states
have
enacted
measures
in
aid
of
motherhood
the
district
of
columbia
is
still
without
such
a
law
a
carefully
considered
bill
will
be
presented
which
ought
to
have
most
thoughtful
consideration
in
order
that
the
congress
may
adopt
a
measure
which
will
be
hereafter
a
model
for
all
parts
of
the
union
civil
service
in
the
congress
passed
the
civil
service
act
which
from
a
modest
beginning
of
employees
has
grown
until
there
are
now
in
the
classified
service
this
has
removed
the
clerical
force
of
the
nation
from
the
wasteful
effects
of
the
spoils
system
and
made
it
more
stable
and
efficient
the
time
has
come
to
consider
classifying
all
postmasters
collectors
of
customs
collectors
of
internal
revenue
and
prohibition
agents
by
an
act
covering
in
those
at
present
in
office
except
when
otherwise
provided
by
executive
order
the
necessary
statistics
are
now
being
gathered
to
form
the
basis
of
a
valuation
of
the
civil
service
retirement
fund
based
on
current
conditions
of
the
service
it
is
confidently
expected
that
this
valuation
will
be
completed
in
time
to
be
made
available
to
the
congress
during
the
present
session
it
will
afford
definite
knowledge
of
existing
and
future
liabilities
under
the
present
law
and
determination
of
liabilities
under
any
proposed
change
in
the
present
law
we
should
have
this
information
before
creating
further
obligations
for
retirement
annuities
which
will
become
liabilities
to
be
met
in
the
future
from
the
money
of
the
taxpayer
the
classification
act
of
with
the
subsequent
legislative
action
providing
for
adjustment
of
the
compensation
of
field
service
positions
has
operated
materially
to
improve
employment
conditions
in
the
federal
service
the
administration
of
the
act
is
in
the
hands
of
an
impartial
board
functioning
without
the
necessity
of
a
direct
appropriation
it
would
be
inadvisable
at
this
time
to
place
in
other
hands
the
administration
of
this
act
federal
trade
commission
the
proper
function
of
the
federal
trade
commission
is
to
supervise
and
correct
those
practices
in
commerce
which
are
detrimental
to
fair
competition
in
this
it
performs
a
useful
function
and
should
be
continued
and
supported
it
was
designed
also
to
be
a
help
to
honest
business
in
my
message
to
the
sixtyeighth
congress
i
recommended
th
at
changes
in
the
procedure
then
existing
be
made
since
then
the
commission
by
its
own
action
has
reformed
its
rules
giving
greater
speed
and
economy
in
the
disposal
of
its
cases
and
full
opportunity
for
those
accused
to
be
heard
these
changes
are
improvements
and
if
necessary
provision
should
be
made
for
their
permanency
reorganization
no
final
action
has
yet
been
taken
on
the
measure
providing
for
the
reorganization
of
the
various
departments
i
therefore
suggest
that
this
measure
which
will
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
efficient
and
economical
administration
of
the
business
of
the
government
be
brought
forward
and
passed
the
negro
nearly
onetenth
of
our
population
consists
of
the
negro
race
the
progress
which
they
have
made
in
all
the
arts
of
civilization
in
the
last
years
is
almost
beyond
belief
our
country
has
no
more
loyal
citizens
but
they
do
still
need
sympathy
kindness
and
helpfulness
they
need
reassurance
that
the
requirements
of
the
government
and
society
to
deal
out
to
them
evenhanded
justice
will
be
met
they
should
be
protected
from
all
violence
and
supported
in
the
peaceable
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
their
labor
those
who
do
violence
to
them
should
be
punished
for
their
crimes
no
other
course
of
action
is
worthy
of
the
american
people
our
country
has
many
elements
in
its
population
many
different
modes
of
thinking
and
living
all
of
which
are
striving
in
their
own
way
to
be
loyal
to
the
high
ideals
worthy
of
the
crown
of
american
citizenship
it
is
fundamental
of
our
institutions
that
they
seek
to
guarantee
to
all
our
inhabitants
the
right
to
live
their
own
lives
under
the
protection
of
the
public
law
this
does
not
include
any
license
to
injure
others
materially
physically
morally
to
incite
revolution
or
to
violate
the
established
customs
which
have
long
had
the
sanction
of
enlightened
society
but
it
does
mean
the
full
right
to
liberty
and
equality
before
the
law
without
distinction
of
race
or
creed
this
condition
can
not
be
granted
to
others
or
enjoyed
by
ourselves
except
by
the
application
of
the
principle
of
broadest
tolerance
bigotry
is
only
another
name
for
slavery
it
reduces
to
serfdom
not
only
those
against
whom
it
is
directed
but
also
those
who
seek
to
apply
it
an
enlarged
freedom
can
only
be
secured
by
the
application
of
the
golden
rule
no
other
utterance
ever
presented
such
a
practical
rule
of
life
conclusion
it
is
apparent
that
we
are
reaching
into
an
era
of
great
general
prosperity
it
will
continue
only
so
long
as
we
shall
use
it
properly
after
all
there
is
but
a
fixed
quantity
of
wealth
in
this
country
at
any
fixed
time
the
only
way
that
we
can
all
secure
more
of
it
is
to
create
more
the
element
of
time
enters
into
production
if
the
people
have
sufficient
moderation
and
contentment
to
be
willing
to
improve
their
condition
by
the
process
of
enlarging
production
eliminating
waste
and
distributing
equitably
a
prosperity
almost
without
limit
lies
before
its
if
the
people
are
to
be
dominated
by
selfishness
seeking
immediate
riches
by
nonproductive
speculation
and
by
wasteful
quarreling
over
the
returns
from
industry
they
will
be
confronted
by
the
inevitable
results
of
depression
and
privation
if
they
will
continue
industrious
and
thrifty
contented
with
fair
wages
and
moderate
profits
and
the
returns
which
accrue
from
the
development
of
oar
natural
resources
our
prosperity
will
extend
itself
indefinitely
in
all
your
deliberations
you
should
remember
that
the
purpose
of
legislation
is
to
translate
principles
into
action
it
is
an
effort
to
have
our
country
be
better
by
doing
better
because
the
thoughts
and
ways
of
people
are
firmly
fixed
and
not
easily
changed
the
field
within
which
immediate
improvement
can
be
secured
is
very
narrow
legislation
can
provide
opportunity
whether
it
is
taken
advantage
of
or
not
depends
upon
the
people
themselves
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
been
created
by
the
people
it
is
solely
responsible
to
them
it
will
be
most
successful
if
it
is
conducted
solely
for
their
benefit
all
its
efforts
would
be
of
little
avail
unless
they
brought
more
justice
more
enlightenment
more
happiness
and
prosperity
into
the
home
this
means
an
opportunity
to
observe
religion
secure
education
and
earn
a
living
under
a
reign
of
law
and
order
it
is
the
growth
and
improvement
of
the
material
and
spiritual
life
of
the
nation
we
shall
not
be
able
to
gain
these
ends
merely
by
our
own
action
if
they
come
at
all
it
will
be
because
we
have
been
willing
to
work
in
harmony
with
the
abiding
purpose
of
a
divine
providence

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
present
state
of
the
union
upon
which
it
is
customary
for
the
president
to
report
to
the
congress
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
is
such
that
it
may
be
regarded
with
encouragement
and
satisfaction
by
every
american
our
country
is
almost
unique
in
its
ability
to
discharge
fully
and
promptly
all
its
obligations
at
home
and
abroad
and
provide
for
all
its
inhabitants
an
increase
in
material
resources
in
intellectual
vigor
and
in
moral
power
the
nation
holds
a
position
unsurpassed
in
all
former
human
experience
this
does
not
mean
that
we
do
not
have
any
problems
it
is
elementary
that
the
increasing
breadth
of
our
experience
necessarily
increases
the
problems
of
our
national
life
but
it
does
mean
that
if
all
will
but
apply
ourselves
industriously
and
honestly
we
have
ample
powers
with
which
to
meet
our
problems
and
provide
for
i
heir
speedy
solution
i
do
not
profess
that
we
can
secure
an
era
of
perfection
in
human
existence
but
we
can
provide
an
era
of
peace
and
prosperity
attended
with
freedom
and
justice
and
made
more
and
more
satisfying
by
the
ministrations
of
the
charities
and
humanities
of
life
our
domestic
problems
are
for
the
most
part
economic
we
have
our
enormous
debt
to
pay
and
we
are
paying
it
we
have
the
high
cost
of
government
to
diminish
and
we
are
diminishing
it
we
have
a
heavy
burden
of
taxation
to
reduce
and
we
are
reducing
it
but
while
remarkable
progress
has
been
made
in
these
directions
the
work
is
yet
far
from
accomplished
we
still
owe
over
the
cost
of
the
national
government
is
still
about
and
the
national
taxes
still
amount
to
about
for
each
one
of
our
inhabitants
there
yet
exists
this
enormous
field
for
the
application
of
economy
in
my
opinion
the
government
can
do
more
to
remedy
the
economic
ills
of
the
people
by
a
system
of
rigid
economy
in
public
expenditure
than
can
be
accomplished
through
any
other
action
the
costs
of
our
national
and
local
governments
combined
now
stand
at
a
sum
close
to
for
each
inhabitant
of
the
land
a
little
less
than
onethird
of
this
is
represented
by
national
expenditure
and
a
little
more
than
twothirds
by
local
expenditure
it
is
an
ominous
fact
that
only
the
national
government
is
reducing
its
debt
others
are
increasing
theirs
at
about
each
year
the
depression
that
overtook
business
the
disaster
experienced
in
agriculture
the
lack
of
employment
and
the
terrific
shrinkage
in
all
values
which
our
country
experienced
in
a
most
acute
form
in
resulted
in
no
small
measure
from
the
prohibitive
taxes
which
were
then
levied
on
all
productive
effort
the
establishment
of
a
system
of
drastic
economy
in
public
expenditure
which
has
enabled
us
to
pay
off
about
onefifth
of
the
national
debt
since
and
almost
cut
in
two
the
national
tax
burden
since
has
been
one
of
the
main
causes
in
reestablishing
a
prosperity
which
has
come
to
include
within
its
benefits
almost
every
one
of
our
inhabitants
economy
reaches
everywhere
it
carries
a
blessing
to
everybody
the
fallacy
of
the
claim
that
the
costs
of
government
are
borne
by
the
rich
and
those
who
make
a
direct
contribution
to
the
national
treasury
can
not
be
too
often
exposed
no
system
has
been
devised
i
do
not
think
any
system
could
be
devised
under
which
any
person
living
in
this
country
could
escape
being
affected
by
the
cost
of
our
government
it
has
a
direct
effect
both
upon
the
rate
and
the
purchasing
power
of
wages
it
is
felt
in
the
price
of
those
prime
necessities
of
existence
food
clothing
fuel
and
shelter
it
would
appear
to
be
elementary
that
the
more
the
government
expends
the
more
it
must
require
every
producer
to
contribute
out
of
his
production
to
the
public
treasury
and
the
less
he
will
have
for
his
own
benefit
the
continuing
costs
of
public
administration
can
be
met
in
only
one
wayby
the
work
of
the
people
the
higher
they
become
the
more
the
people
must
work
for
the
government
the
less
they
are
the
more
the
people
can
work
for
themselves
the
present
estimated
margin
between
public
receipts
and
expenditures
for
this
fiscal
year
is
very
small
perhaps
the
most
important
work
that
this
session
of
the
congress
can
do
is
to
continue
a
policy
of
economy
and
further
reduce
the
cost
of
government
in
order
that
we
may
have
a
reduction
of
taxes
for
the
next
fiscal
year
nothing
is
more
likely
to
produce
that
public
confidence
which
is
the
forerunner
and
the
mainstay
of
prosperity
encourage
and
enlarge
business
opportunity
with
ample
opportunity
for
employment
at
good
wages
provide
a
larger
market
for
agricultural
products
and
put
our
country
in
a
stronger
position
to
be
able
to
meet
the
world
competition
in
trade
than
a
continuing
policy
of
economy
of
course
necessary
costs
must
be
met
proper
functions
of
the
government
performed
and
constant
investments
for
capital
account
and
reproductive
effort
must
be
carried
on
by
our
various
departments
but
the
people
must
know
that
their
government
is
placing
upon
them
no
unnecessary
burden
taxes
everyone
desires
a
reduction
of
taxes
and
there
is
a
great
preponderance
of
sentiment
in
favor
of
taxation
reform
when
i
approved
the
present
tax
law
i
stated
publicly
that
i
did
so
in
spite
of
certain
provisions
which
i
believed
unwise
and
harmful
one
of
the
most
glaring
of
these
was
the
making
public
of
the
amounts
assessed
against
different
incometax
payers
although
that
damage
has
now
been
done
i
believe
its
continuation
to
be
detrimental
to
the
public
welfare
and
bound
to
decrease
public
revenues
so
that
it
ought
to
be
repealed
anybody
can
reduce
taxes
but
it
is
not
so
easy
to
stand
in
the
gap
and
resist
the
passage
of
increasing
appropriation
bills
which
would
make
tax
reduction
impossible
it
will
be
very
easy
to
measure
the
strength
of
the
attachment
to
reduced
taxation
by
the
power
with
which
increased
appropriations
are
resisted
if
at
the
close
of
the
present
session
the
congress
has
kept
within
the
budget
which
i
propose
to
present
it
will
then
be
possible
to
have
a
moderate
amount
of
tax
reduction
and
all
the
tax
reform
that
the
congress
may
wish
for
during
the
next
fiscal
year
the
country
is
now
feeling
the
direct
stimulus
which
came
from
the
passage
of
the
last
revenue
bill
and
under
the
assurance
of
a
reasonable
system
of
taxation
there
is
every
prospect
of
an
era
of
prosperity
of
unprecedented
proportions
but
it
would
be
idle
to
expect
any
such
results
unless
business
can
continue
free
from
excess
profits
taxation
and
be
accorded
a
system
of
surtaxes
at
rates
which
have
for
their
object
not
the
punishment
of
success
or
the
discouragement
of
business
but
the
production
of
the
greatest
amount
of
revenue
from
large
incomes
i
am
convinced
that
the
larger
incomes
of
the
country
would
actually
yield
more
revenue
to
the
government
if
the
basis
of
taxation
were
scientifically
revised
downward
moreover
the
effect
of
the
present
method
of
this
taxation
is
to
increase
the
cost
of
interest
on
productive
enterprise
and
to
increase
the
burden
of
rent
it
is
altogether
likely
that
such
reduction
would
so
encourage
and
stimulate
investment
that
it
would
firmly
establish
our
country
in
the
economic
leadership
of
the
world
waterways
meantime
our
internal
development
should
go
on
provision
should
be
made
for
flood
control
of
such
rivers
as
the
mississippi
and
the
colorado
and
for
the
opening
up
of
our
inland
waterways
to
commerce
consideration
is
due
to
the
project
of
better
navigation
from
the
great
lakes
to
the
gulf
every
effort
is
being
made
to
promote
an
agreement
with
canada
to
build
the
st
lawrence
waterway
there
are
pending
before
the
congress
bills
for
further
development
of
the
mississippi
basin
for
the
taking
over
of
the
cape
cod
canal
in
accordance
with
a
moral
obligation
which
seems
to
have
been
incurred
during
the
war
and
for
the
improvement
of
harbors
on
both
the
pacific
and
the
atlantic
coasts
while
this
last
should
be
divested
of
some
of
its
projects
and
we
must
proceed
slowly
these
bills
in
general
have
my
approval
such
works
are
productive
of
wealth
and
in
the
long
run
tend
to
a
reduction
of
the
tax
burden
reclamation
our
country
has
a
well
defined
policy
of
reclamation
established
under
statutory
authority
this
policy
should
be
continued
and
made
a
selfsustaining
activity
administered
in
a
manner
that
will
meet
local
requirements
and
bring
our
and
lands
into
a
profitable
state
of
cultivation
as
fast
as
there
is
a
market
for
their
products
legislation
is
pending
based
on
the
report
of
the
fact
finding
commission
for
the
proper
relief
of
those
needing
extension
of
time
in
which
to
meet
their
payments
on
irrigated
land
and
for
additional
amendments
and
reforms
of
our
reclamation
laws
which
are
all
exceedingly
important
and
should
be
enacted
at
once
no
more
important
development
has
taken
place
in
the
last
year
than
the
beginning
of
a
restoration
of
agriculture
to
a
prosperous
condition
we
must
permit
no
division
of
classes
in
this
country
with
one
occupation
striving
to
secure
advantage
over
another
each
must
proceed
under
open
opportunities
and
with
a
fair
prospect
of
economic
equality
the
government
can
not
successfully
insure
prosperity
or
fix
prices
by
legislative
fiat
every
business
has
its
risk
and
its
times
of
depression
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
long
run
there
will
be
a
more
even
prosperity
and
a
more
satisfactory
range
of
prices
under
the
natural
working
out
of
economic
laws
than
when
the
government
undertakes
the
artificial
support
of
markets
and
industries
still
we
can
so
order
our
affairs
so
protect
our
own
people
from
foreign
competition
so
arrange
our
national
finances
so
administer
our
monetary
system
so
provide
for
the
extension
of
credits
so
improve
methods
of
distribution
as
to
provide
a
better
working
machinery
for
the
transaction
of
the
business
of
the
nation
with
the
least
possible
friction
and
loss
the
government
has
been
constantly
increasing
its
efforts
in
these
directions
for
the
relief
and
permanent
establishment
of
agriculture
on
a
sound
and
equal
basis
with
other
business
it
is
estimated
that
the
value
of
th
e
crops
for
this
harvest
year
may
reach
which
is
an
increase
of
over
in
three
years
it
compares
with
in
and
if
we
make
deduction
from
the
figures
of
for
the
comparatively
decreased
value
of
the
dollar
the
yield
this
year
still
exceeds
in
purchasing
power
by
over
and
in
this
interval
there
has
been
no
increase
in
the
number
of
farmers
mostly
by
his
own
effort
the
farmer
has
decreased
the
cost
of
production
a
marked
increase
in
the
price
of
his
products
and
some
decrease
in
the
price
of
his
supplies
has
brought
him
about
to
a
parity
with
the
rest
of
the
nation
the
crop
area
of
this
season
is
estimated
at
acres
which
is
a
decline
of
acres
from
last
year
and
acres
from
this
has
been
a
normal
and
natural
application
of
economic
laws
which
has
placed
agriculture
on
a
foundation
which
is
undeniably
sound
and
beginning
to
be
satisfactory
a
decrease
in
the
world
supply
of
wheat
has
resulted
in
a
very
large
increase
in
the
price
of
that
commodity
the
position
of
all
agricultural
products
indicates
a
better
balanced
supply
but
we
can
not
yet
conclude
that
agriculture
is
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
war
period
or
that
it
is
permanently
on
a
prosperous
basis
the
cattle
industry
has
not
yet
recovered
and
in
some
sections
has
been
suffering
from
dry
weather
every
effort
must
be
made
both
by
government
activity
and
by
private
agencies
to
restore
and
maintain
agriculture
to
a
complete
normal
relationship
with
other
industries
it
was
on
account
of
past
depression
and
in
spite
of
present
more
encouraging
conditions
that
i
have
assembled
an
agricultural
conference
made
up
of
those
who
are
representative
of
this
great
industry
in
both
its
operating
and
economic
sides
everyone
knows
that
the
great
need
of
the
farmers
is
markets
the
country
is
not
suffering
on
the
side
of
production
almost
the
entire
difficulty
is
on
the
side
of
distribution
this
reaches
back
of
course
to
unit
costs
and
diversification
and
many
allied
subjects
it
is
exceedingly
intricate
for
our
domestic
and
foreign
trade
transportation
and
banking
and
in
fact
our
entire
economic
system
are
closely
related
to
it
in
time
for
action
at
this
session
i
hope
to
report
to
the
congress
such
legislative
remedies
as
the
conference
may
recommend
an
appropriation
should
be
made
to
defray
their
necessary
expenses
muscle
shoals
the
production
of
nitrogen
for
plant
food
in
peace
and
explosives
in
war
is
more
and
more
important
it
is
one
of
the
chief
sustaining
elements
of
life
it
is
estimated
that
soil
exhaustion
each
year
is
represented
by
about
tons
and
replenishment
by
tons
the
deficit
of
tons
is
reported
to
represent
the
impairment
of
acres
of
farm
lands
each
year
to
meet
these
necessities
the
government
has
been
developing
a
water
power
project
at
muscle
shoals
to
be
equipped
to
produce
nitrogen
for
explosives
and
fertilizer
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
support
of
agriculture
is
the
chief
problem
to
consider
in
connection
with
this
property
it
could
by
no
means
supply
the
present
needs
for
nitrogen
but
it
would
help
and
its
development
would
encourage
bringing
other
water
powers
into
like
use
several
offers
have
been
made
for
the
purchase
of
this
property
probably
none
of
them
represent
final
terms
much
costly
experimentation
is
necessary
to
produce
commercial
nitrogen
for
that
reason
it
is
a
field
better
suited
to
private
enterprise
than
to
government
operation
i
should
favor
a
sale
of
this
property
or
longtime
lease
tinder
rigid
guaranties
of
commercial
nitrogen
production
at
reasonable
prices
for
agricultural
use
there
would
be
a
surplus
of
power
for
many
years
over
any
possibility
of
its
application
to
a
developing
manufacture
of
nitrogen
it
may
be
found
advantageous
to
dispose
of
the
right
to
surplus
power
separately
with
such
reservations
as
will
allow
its
gradual
withdrawal
and
application
to
nitrogen
manufacture
a
subcommittee
of
the
committees
on
agriculture
should
investigate
this
field
and
negotiate
with
prospective
purchasers
if
no
advantageous
offer
be
made
the
development
should
continue
and
the
plant
should
be
dedicated
primarily
to
the
production
of
materials
for
the
fertilization
of
the
soil
railways
the
railways
during
the
past
year
have
made
still
further
progress
in
recuperation
from
the
war
with
large
rains
in
efficiency
and
ability
expeditiously
to
handle
the
traffic
of
the
country
we
have
now
passed
through
several
periods
of
peak
traffic
without
the
car
shortages
which
so
frequently
in
the
past
have
brought
havoc
to
our
agriculture
and
industries
the
condition
of
many
of
our
great
freight
terminals
is
still
one
of
difficulty
and
results
in
imposing
large
costs
on
the
public
for
inwardbound
freight
and
on
the
railways
for
outwardbound
freight
owing
to
the
growth
of
our
large
cities
and
the
great
increase
in
the
volume
of
traffic
particularly
in
perishables
the
problem
is
not
only
difficult
of
solution
but
in
some
cases
not
wholly
solvable
by
railway
action
alone
in
my
message
last
year
i
emphasized
the
necessity
for
further
legislation
with
a
view
to
expediting
the
consolidation
of
our
rail
ways
into
larger
systems
the
principle
of
government
control
of
rates
and
profits
now
thoroughly
imbedded
in
our
governmental
attitude
toward
natural
monopolies
such
as
the
railways
at
once
eliminates
the
need
of
competition
by
small
units
as
a
method
of
rate
adjustment
competition
must
be
preserved
as
a
stimulus
to
service
but
this
will
exist
and
can
be
increased
tinder
enlarged
systems
consequently
the
consolidation
of
the
railways
into
larger
units
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
substantial
values
to
the
public
which
will
come
from
larger
operation
has
been
the
logical
conclusion
of
congress
in
its
previous
enactments
and
is
also
supported
by
the
best
opinion
in
the
country
such
consolidation
will
assure
not
only
a
greater
element
of
competition
as
to
service
but
it
will
afford
economy
in
operation
greater
stability
in
railway
earnings
and
more
economical
financing
it
opens
large
possibilities
of
better
equalization
of
rates
between
different
classes
of
traffic
so
as
to
relieve
undue
burdens
upon
agricultural
products
and
raw
materials
generally
which
are
now
not
possible
without
ruin
to
small
units
owing
to
the
lack
of
diversity
of
traffic
it
would
also
tend
to
equalize
earnings
in
such
fashion
as
to
reduce
the
importance
of
section
a
at
which
criticism
often
misapplied
has
been
directed
a
smaller
number
of
units
would
offer
less
difficulties
in
labor
adjustments
and
would
contribute
much
to
the
solution
of
terminal
difficulties
the
consolidations
need
to
be
carried
out
with
due
regard
to
public
interest
and
to
the
rights
and
established
life
of
various
communities
in
our
country
it
does
not
seem
to
me
necessary
that
we
endeavor
to
anticipate
any
final
plan
or
adhere
to
an
artificial
and
unchangeable
project
which
shall
stipulate
a
fixed
number
of
systems
but
rather
we
ought
to
approach
the
problem
with
such
a
latitude
of
action
that
it
can
be
worked
out
step
by
step
in
accordance
with
a
comprehensive
consideration
of
public
interest
whether
the
number
of
ultimate
systems
shall
be
more
or
less
seems
to
me
can
only
be
determined
by
time
and
actual
experience
in
the
development
of
such
consolidations
those
portions
of
the
present
law
contemplating
consolidations
ore
not
sufficiently
effective
in
producing
expeditious
action
and
need
amplification
of
the
authority
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
particularly
in
affording
a
period
for
voluntary
proposals
to
the
commission
and
in
supplying
government
pressure
to
secure
action
after
the
expiration
of
such
a
period
there
are
other
proposals
before
congress
for
amending
the
transportation
acts
one
of
these
contemplates
a
revision
of
the
method
of
valuation
for
ratemaking
purposes
to
be
followed
by
a
renewed
valuation
of
the
railways
the
valuations
instituted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
years
ago
have
not
yet
been
completed
they
have
cost
the
government
an
enormous
sum
and
they
have
imposed
great
expenditure
upon
the
railways
most
of
which
has
in
effect
come
out
of
the
public
in
increased
rates
this
work
should
not
be
abandoned
or
supplanted
until
its
results
are
known
and
can
be
considered
another
matter
before
the
congress
is
legislation
affecting
the
labor
sections
of
the
transportation
act
much
criticism
has
been
directed
at
the
workings
of
this
section
and
experience
has
shown
that
some
useful
amendment
could
be
made
to
these
provisions
it
would
be
helpful
if
a
plan
could
be
adopted
which
while
retaining
the
practice
of
systematic
collective
bargaining
with
conciliation
voluntary
arbitration
of
labor
differences
could
also
provide
simplicity
in
relations
and
more
direct
local
responsibility
of
employees
and
managers
but
such
legislation
will
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
situation
unless
it
recognizes
the
principle
that
t
e
public
has
a
right
to
the
uninterrupted
service
of
transportation
and
therefore
a
right
to
be
heard
when
there
is
danger
that
the
nation
may
suffer
great
injury
through
the
interruption
of
operations
because
of
labor
disputes
if
these
elements
are
not
comprehended
in
proposed
legislation
it
would
be
better
to
gain
further
experience
with
the
present
organization
for
dealing
with
these
questions
before
undertaking
a
change
shipping
board
the
form
of
the
organization
of
the
shipping
board
was
based
originally
on
its
functions
as
a
semi
judicial
body
in
regulation
of
rates
during
the
war
it
was
loaded
with
enormous
administrative
duties
it
has
been
demonstrated
time
and
again
that
this
form
of
organization
results
in
indecision
division
of
opinion
and
administrative
functions
which
make
a
wholly
inadequate
foundation
for
the
conduct
of
a
great
business
enterprise
the
first
principle
in
securing
the
objective
set
out
by
congress
in
building
up
the
american
merchant
marine
upon
the
great
trade
routes
and
subsequently
disposing
of
it
into
private
operation
can
not
proceed
with
effectiveness
until
the
entire
functions
of
the
board
are
reorganized
the
immediate
requirement
is
to
t
ransfer
into
the
emergency
fleet
corporation
the
whole
responsibility
of
operation
of
the
fleet
and
other
property
leaving
to
the
shipping
board
solely
the
duty
of
determining
certain
major
policies
which
require
deliberative
action
the
procedure
under
section
of
the
merchant
marine
act
has
created
great
difficulty
and
threatened
friction
during
the
past
months
its
attempted
application
developed
not
only
great
opposition
from
exporters
particularly
as
to
burdens
that
may
be
imposed
upon
agricultural
products
but
also
great
anxiety
in
the
different
seaports
as
to
the
effect
upon
their
relative
rate
structures
this
trouble
will
certainly
recur
if
action
is
attempted
under
this
section
it
is
uncertain
in
some
of
its
terms
and
of
great
difficulty
in
interpretation
it
is
my
belief
that
action
under
this
section
should
be
suspended
until
the
congress
can
reconsider
the
entire
question
in
the
light
of
the
experience
that
has
been
developed
since
its
enactment
national
elections
nothing
is
so
fundamental
to
the
integrity
of
a
republican
form
of
government
as
honesty
in
all
that
relates
to
the
conduct
of
elections
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
national
laws
governing
the
choice
of
members
of
the
congress
should
be
extended
to
include
appropriate
representation
of
the
respective
parties
at
the
ballot
box
ant
equality
of
representation
on
the
various
registration
boards
wherever
they
exist
the
judiciary
the
docket
of
the
supreme
court
is
becoming
congested
at
the
opening
term
last
year
it
had
cases
while
this
year
it
had
cases
justice
long
delayed
is
justice
refused
unless
the
court
be
given
power
by
preliminary
and
summary
consideration
to
determine
the
importance
of
cases
and
by
disposing
of
those
which
are
not
of
public
moment
reserve
its
time
for
the
more
extended
consideration
of
the
remainder
the
congestion
of
the
docket
is
likely
to
increase
it
is
also
desirable
that
supreme
court
should
have
power
to
improve
and
reform
procedure
in
suits
at
law
in
the
federal
courts
through
the
adoption
of
appropriate
rules
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
senate
has
reported
favorably
upon
two
bills
providing
for
these
reforms
which
should
have
the
immediate
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
i
further
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
consist
of
two
or
three
members
of
the
federal
judiciary
and
as
many
members
of
the
bar
to
examine
the
present
criminal
code
of
procedure
and
recommend
to
the
congress
measures
which
may
reform
and
expedite
court
procedure
in
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
our
criminal
laws
prison
reform
pending
before
the
congress
is
a
bill
which
has
already
passed
one
house
providing
for
a
reformatory
to
which
could
be
committed
first
offenders
and
young
men
for
the
purpose
of
segregating
them
from
contact
with
banned
criminals
and
providing
them
with
special
training
in
order
to
reestablish
in
them
the
power
to
pursue
a
lawabiding
existence
in
the
social
and
economic
life
of
the
nation
this
is
a
matter
of
so
much
importance
as
to
warrant
the
early
attention
of
the
present
session
further
provision
should
also
be
made
for
a
like
reason
for
a
separate
reformatory

representatives
of

police
conference
will
bring
to
t
e
attention
of
the
congress
a
proposal
for
the
establishment
of
a
national
police
bureau
such
action
would
provide
a
central
point
for
gathering
compiling
and
later
distributing
to
local
police
authorities
much
information
which
would
be
helpful
in
the
prevention
and
detection
of
crime
i
believe
this
bureau
is
needed
and
i
recommend
favorable
consideration
of
this
proposal

the
welfare
work
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
administered
by
several
different
boards
dealing
with
charities
and
various
correctional
efforts
it
would
be
an
improvement
if
this

were
consolidated
and
placed
under
the
direction
of
a

french
spoliation
claims
during
the
last
session
of
the
congress
legislation
was
introduced
looking
to
the
payment
of
the
remaining
claims
generally
referred
to
as
the
french
spoliation
claims
the
congress
has
provided
for
the
payment
of
many
similar
claims
those
that
remain
unpaid
have
been
long
pending
the
beneficiaries
thereunder
have
every
reason
to
expect
payment
these
claims
have
been
examined
by
the
court
of
claims
and
their
validity
and
amount
determined
the
united
states
ought
to
pay
its
debts
i
recommend
action
by
the
congress
which
will
permit
of
the
payment
of
these
remaining
claims
the

earner
two
very
important
policies
have
been
adopted
by
this
country
which
while
extending
their
benefits
also
in
other
directions
have
been
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
wage
earners
one
of
these
is
the
protective
tariff
which
enables
our
people
to
live
according
to
a
better
standard
and
receive
a
better
rate
of
compensation
than
any
people
any
time
anywhere
on
earth
ever
enjoyed
this
saves
the
american
market
for
the
products
of
the
american
workmen
the
other
is
a
policy
of
more
recent
origin
and
seeks
to
shield
our
wage
earners
from
the
disastrous
competition
of
a
great
influx
of
foreign
peoples
this
has
been
done
by
the
restrictive
immigration
law
this
saves
the
american
job
for
the
american
workmen
i
should
like
to
see
the
administrative
features
of
this
law
rendered
a
little
more
humane
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
those
already
here
a
greater
latitude
in
securing
admission
of
members
of
their
own
families
but
i
believe
this
law
in
principle
is
necessary
and
sound
and
destined
to
increase
greatly
the
public
welfare
we
must
maintain
our
own
economic
position
we
must
defend
our
own
national
integrity
it
is
gratifying
to
report
that
the
progress
of
industry
the
enormous
increase
in
individual
productivity
through
laborsaving
devices
and
the
high
rate
of
wages
have
all
combined
to
furnish
our
people
in
general
with
such
an
abundance
not
only
of
the
necessaries
but
of
the
conveniences
of
life
that
we
are
by
a
natural
evolution
solving
our
problems
of
economic
and
social
justice
the
negro
these
developments
have
brought
about
a
very
remarkable
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
negro
race
gradually
but
surely
with
the
almost
universal
sympathy
of
those
among
whom
they
live
the
colored
people
are
working
out
their
own
destiny
i
firmly
believe
that
it
is
better
for
all
concerned
that
they
should
be
cheerfully
accorded
their
full
constitutional
rights
that
they
should
be
protected
from
all
of
those
impositions
to
which
from
their
position
they
naturally
fall
a
prey
especially
from
the
crime
of
lynching
and
that
they
should
receive
every
encouragement
to
become
full
partakers
in
all
the
blessings
of
our
common
american
citizenship
civil

the
merit
system
has
long
been
recognized
as
the
correct
basis
for

in

believe
that
first
second

third
class
postmasters
and
without
covering
in
the
present
membership
the
field
force
of
prohibition
enforcement
should
be
brought
within

otherwise
the

of
one
administration
is
changed
by
the
executive
order
of
another

and
little
real
progress
is
made
whatever
its
defects
the

system
is
certainly
to
be
preferred
to

departmental

one
way
to

would
be

this
project
has
been
pending
for
some
time
and
has
had
the
most
careful
consideration
of
experts

the
thorough
study

this

is
vital
as

a
thorough

of

with
some
latitude

make
for

activities
which
must
follow
every
change
in
a
developing

of

a

worthy

a
large
saving
in

and
a
considerable

shall
do
well
to

impressed
by
such

such
actions
any

undertaking

tain

designs
will
find
itself
severely
handicapped
in

i
believe
thoroughly
in

adequate
defense
and
preparation
but
i
am
opposed
to
any
policy
of
competition
in

maintaining

armaments
our
country
has
definitely
relinquished
the
old
standard
of
dealing
with
other
countries
by
terror
and
force
and
is
definitely
committed
to
the
new
standard
of
dealing
with
them
through
friendship
and
understanding
this
new
policy
should
be
constantly
kept
in
mind
by
the
guiding
forces
of
the

by
the

and
by
the
country
at
large
i
believe
it
holds
a
promise
of
great
benefit
to
humanity
i
shall
resist
any
attempt
to
resort
to
the
old
methods
and
the
old
standards
i
am
especially
solicitous
that
foreign
nations
should
comprehend
the
candor
and
sincerity
with
which
we
have
adopted
this
position
while
we
propose
to
maintain

to

wish

our

have
greatly
strengthened

the

which
our

not

restored
that

resume

in
the
increase

look

must
depend

must

have
every
desire

but
with
all
our
resources
we
are
powerless
to
save

our

meet
with
a

our

all
over
the

can
be
improved
only
by
bard
work
and
selfdenial
it
is
necessary
to
reduce

increase

and
liquidate

it
is
in
this
direction
that
there
lies
the
greatest
hope
of
domestic
tranquility
and
international
peace
our
own
country
ought
to
finish
the
leading
example
in
this
effort
our
past
adherence
to
this
policy
our
constant
refusal
to
maintain
a
military
establishment
that
could
be
thought
to
menace
the
security
of
others
our
honorable
dealings
with
other
nations
whether
great
or
small
has
left
us
in
the
almost
constant
enjoyment
of
peace
it
is
not
necessary
to
stress
the
general
desire
of
all
the
people
of
this
country
for
the
promotion
of
peace
it
is
the
leading
principle
of
all
our
foreign
relations
we
have
on
every
occasion
tried
to
cooperate
to
this
end
in
all
ways
that
were
consistent
with
our
proper
independence
and
our
traditional
policies
it
will
be
my
constant
effort
to
maintain
these
principles
and
to
reinforce
them
by
all
appropriate
agreements
and
treaties
while
we
desire
always
to
cooperate
and
to
help
we
are
equally
determined
to
be
independent
and
free
right
and
truth
and
justice
and
humanitarian
efforts
will
have
the
moral
support
of
this
country
all
over
the
world
but
we
do
not
wish
to
become
involved
in
the
political
controversies
of
others
nor
is
the
country
disposed
to
become
a
member
of
the
league
of
nations
or
to
assume
the
obligations
imposed
by
its
covenant
international
court
america
has
been
one
of
the
foremost
nations
in
advocating
tribunals
for
the
settlement
of
international
disputes
of
a
justiciable
character
our
representatives
took
a
leading
in
those
conferences
which
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
e
ague
tribunal
and
later
in
providing
for
a
permanent
court
of
international
justice
i
believe
it
would
be
for
the
advantage
of
this
country
and
helpful
to
the
stability
of
other
nations
for
us
to
adhere
to
the
protocol
establishing
that
court
upon
the
conditions
stated
in
the
recommendation
which
is
now
before
the
senate
and
further
that
our
country
shall
not
be
bound
by
advisory
opinions
which
may
be
rendered
by
the
court
upon
questions
which
we
have
not
voluntarily
submitted
for
its
judgment
this
court
would
provide
a
practical
and
convenient
tribunal
before
which
we
could
go
voluntarily
but
to
which
we
could
not
be
summoned
for
a
determination
of
justiciable
questions
when
they
fail
to
be
resolved
by
diplomatic
negotiations

many
times

appropriately
supplemented
by
further

further

of
diminishing
the

has
been
and
is
my
expectation
that
we
might
hopefully
approach
other
great

for

this
subject
as
soon
as
the

europe
has
created
a
favorable
opportunity
but
on
account
of
proposals
which
have
already
been
made
by
other
governments
for
a
european
conference
it
will
be
necessary
to
wait
to
see
what
the
outcome
of
their
actions
may
be
i
should
not
wish
to
propose
or
have
representatives
attend
a
conference
which
would
contemplate
commitments
opposed
to
the
freedom
of
action
we
desire
to
maintain
unimpaired
with
respect
to
our
purely
domestic
policies
international
law
our
country
should
also
support
efforts
which
are
being
made
toward
the
codification
of
international
law
we
can
look
more
hopefully
in
the
first
instance
for
research
and
studies
that
are
likely
to
be
productive
of
results
to
a
cooperation
among
representatives
of
the
bar
and
members
of
international
law
institutes
and
societies
than
to
a
conference
of
those
who
are
technically
representative
of
their
respective
governments
although
when
projects
have
been
developed
they
must
go
to
the
governments
for
their
approval
these
expert
professional
studies
are
going
on
in
certain
quarters
and
should
have
our
constant
encouragement
and
approval
outlaw
of
war
much
interest
has
of
late
been
manifested
in
this
country
in
the
discussion
of
various
proposals
to
outlaw
aggressive
war
i
look
with
great
sympathy
upon
the
examination
of
this
subject
it
is
in
harmony
with
the
traditional
policy
of
our
country
which
is
against
aggressive
war
and
for
the
maintenance
of
permanent
and
honorable
peace
while
as
i
have
said
we
must
safeguard
our
liberty
to
deal
according
to
our
own
judgment
with
our
domestic
policies
we
can
not
fail
to
view
with
sympathetic
interest
all
progress
to
this
desired
end
or
carefully
to
study
the
measures
that
may
be
proposed
to
attain
it
latin
america
while
we
are
desirous
of
promoting
peace
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
we
have
a
special
interest
in
the
peace
of
this
hemisphere
it
is
our
constant
desire
that
all
causes
of
dispute
in
this
area
may
be
tranquilly
and
satisfactorily
adjusted
along
with
our
desire
for
peace
is
the
earnest
hope
for
the
increased
prosperity
of
our
sister
republics
of
latin
america
and
our
constant
purpose
to
promote
cooperation
with
them
which
may
be
mutually
beneficial
and
always
inspired
by
the
most
cordial
friendships
foreign
debts
about
is
due
to
our
government
from
abroad
mostly
from
european
governments
great
britain
finland
hungary
lithuania
and
poland
have
negotiated
settlements
amounting
close
to
this
represents
the
funding
of
over
per
cent
of
the
debt
since
the
creation
of
the
special
foreign
debt
commission
as
the
life
of
this
commission
is
about
to
expire
its
term
should
be
extended
i
am
opposed
to
the
cancellation
of
these
debts
and
believe
it
for
the
best
welfare
of
the
world
that
they
should
be
liquidated
and
paid
as
fast
as
possible
i
do
not
favor
oppressive
measures
but
unless
money
that
is
borrowed
is
repaid
credit
can
not
be
secured
in
time
of
necessity
and
there
exists
besides
a
moral
obligation
which
our
country
can
not
ignore
and
no
other
country
can
evade
terms
and
conditions
may
have
to
conform
to
differences
in
the
financial
abilities
of
the
countries
concerned
but
th
e
principle
that
each
country
should
meet
its
obligation
admits
of
no
differences
and
is
of
universal
application
it
is
axiomatic
that
our
country
can
not
stand
still
it
would
seem
to
be
perfectly
plain
from
recent
events
that
it
is
determined
to
go
forward
but
it
wants
no
pretenses
it
wants
no
vagaries
it
is
determined
to
advance
in
an
orderly
sound
and
commonsense
way
it
does
not
propose
to
abandon
the
theory
of
the
declaration
that
the
people
have
inalienable
rights
which
no
majority
and
no
power
of
government
can
destroy
it
does
not
propose
to
abandon
the
practice
of
the
constitution
that
provides
for
the
protection
of
these
rights
it
believes
that
within
these
limitations
which
are
imposed
not
by
the
fiat
of
man
but
by
the
law
of
the
creator
selfgovernment
is
just
and
wise
it
is
convinced
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
the
people
to
provide
their
own
government
unless
they
continue
to
own
their
own
property
these
are
the
very
foundations
of
america
on
them
has
been
erected
a
government
of
freedom
and
equality
of
justice
and
mercy
of
education
and
charity
living
under
it
and
supporting
it
the
people
have
come
into
great
possessions
on
the
material
and
spiritual
sides
of
life
i
want
to
continue
in
this
direction
i
know
that
the
congress
shares
with
me
that
desire
i
want
our
institutions
to
be
more
and
more
expressive
of
these
principles
i
want
the
people
of
all
the
earth
to
see
in
the
american
flag
the
symbol
of
a
government
which
intends
no
oppression
at
home
and
no
aggression
abroad
which
in
the
spirit
of
a
common
brotherhood
provides
assistance
in
time
of
distress

since
the
close
of
the
last
congress
the
nation
has
lost
president
harding
the
world
knew
his
kindness
and
his
humanity
his
greatness
and
his
character
he
has
left
his
mark
upon
history
he
has
made
justice
more
certain
and
peace
more
secure
the
surpassing
tribute
paid
to
his
memory
as
he
was
borne
across
the
continent
to
rest
at
last
at
home
revealed
the
place
he
held
in
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
but
this
is
not
the
occasion
for
extended
reference
to
the
man
or
his
work
in
this
presence
among
these
who
knew
and
loved
him
that
is
unnecessary
but
we
who
were
associated
with
him
could
not
resume
together
the
functions
of
our
office
without
pausing
for
a
moment
and
in
his
memory
reconsecrating
ourselves
to
the
service
of
our
country
he
is
gone
we
remain
it
is
our
duty
under
the
inspiration
of
his
example
to
take
up
the
burdens
which
he
was
permitted
to
lay
down
and
to
develop
and
support
the
wise
principles
of
government
which
he
represented
foreign
affairs
for
us
peace
reigns
everywhere
we
desire
to
perpetuate
it
always
by
granting
full
justice
to
others
and
requiring
of
others
full
justice
to
ourselves
our
country
has
one
cardinal
principle
to
maintain
in
its
foreign
policy
it
is
an
american
principle
it
must
be
an
american
policy
we
attend
to
our
own
affairs
conserve
our
own
strength
and
protect
the
interests
of
our
own
citizens
but
we
recognize
thoroughly
our
obligation
to
help
others
reserving
to
the
decision
of
our
own
judgment
the
time
the
place
and
the
method
we
realize
the
common
bond
of
humanity
we
know
the
inescapable
law
of
service
our
country
has
definitely
refused
to
adopt
and
ratify
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
we
have
not
felt
warranted
in
assuming
the
responsibilities
which
its
members
have
assumed
i
am
not
proposing
any
change
in
this
policy
neither
is
the
senate
the
incident
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
closed
the
league
exists
as
a
foreign
agency
we
hope
it
will
be
helpful
but
the
united
states
sees
no
reason
to
limit
its
own
freedom
and
independence
of
action
by
joining
it
we
shall
do
well
to
recognize
this
basic
fact
in
all
national
affairs
and
govern
ourselves
accordingly
world
court
our
foreign
policy
has
always
been
guided
by
two
principles
the
one
is
the
avoidance
of
permanent
political
alliances
which
would
sacrifice
our
proper
independence
the
other
is
the
peaceful
settlement
of
controversies
between
nations
by
example
and
by
treaty
we
have
advocated
arbitration
for
nearly
years
we
have
been
a
member
of
the
hague
tribunal
and
have
long
sought
the
creation
of
a
permanent
world
court
of
justice
i
am
in
full
accord
with
both
of
these
policies
i
favor
the
establishment
of
such
a
court
intended
to
include
the
whole
world
that
is
and
has
long
been
an
american
policy
pending
before
the
senate
is
a
proposal
that
this
government
give
its
support
to
the
permanent
court
of
international
justice
which
is
a
new
and
somewhat
different
plan
this
is
not
a
partisan
question
it
should
not
assume
an
artificial
importance
the
court
is
merely
a
convenient
instrument
of
adjustment
to
which
we
could
go
but
to
which
we
could
not
be
brought
it
should
be
discussed
with
entire
candor
not
by
a
political
but
by
a
judicial
method
without
pressure
and
without
prejudice
partisanship
has
no
place
in
our
foreign
relations
as
i
wish
to
see
a
court
established
and
as
the
proposal
presents
the
only
practical
plan
on
which
many
nations
have
ever
agreed
though
it
may
not
meet
every
desire
i
therefore
commend
it
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
senate
with
the
proposed
reservations
clearly
indicating
our
refusal
to
adhere
to
the
league
of
nations
russia
our
diplomatic
relations
lately
so
largely
interrupted
are
now
being
resumed
but
russia
presents
notable
difficulties
we
have
every
desire
to
see
that
great
people
who
are
our
traditional
friends
restored
to
their
position
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
we
have
relieved
their
pitiable
destitution
with
an
enormous
charity
our
government
offers
no
objection
to
the
carrying
on
of
commerce
by
our
citizens
with
the
people
of
russia
our
government
does
not
propose
however
to
enter
into
relations
with
another
regime
which
refuses
to
recognize
the
sanctity
of
international
obligations
i
do
not
propose
to
barter
away
for
the
privilege
of
trade
any
of
the
cherished
rights
of
humanity
i
do
not
propose
to
make
merchandise
of
any
american
principles
these
rights
and
principles
must
go
wherever
the
sanctions
of
our
government
go
but
while
the
favor
of
america
is
not
for
sale
i
am
willing
to
make
very
large
concessions
for
the
purpose
of
rescuing
the
people
of
russia
already
encouraging
evidences
of
returning
to
the
ancient
ways
of
society
can
be
detected
but
more
are
needed
whenever
there
appears
any
disposition
to
compensate
our
citizens
who
were
despoiled
and
to
recognize
that
debt
contracted
with
our
government
not
by
the
czar
but
by
the
newly
formed
republic
of
russia
whenever
the
active
spirit
of
enmity
to
our
institutions
is
abated
whenever
there
appear
works
mete
for
repentance
our
country
ought
to
be
the
first
to
go
to
the
economic
and
moral
rescue
of
russia
we
have
every
desire
to
help
and
no
desire
to
injure
we
hope
the
time
is
near
at
hand
when
we
can
act
debts
the
current
debt
and
interest
due
from
foreign
governments
exclusive
of
the
british
debt
of
is
about
i
do
not
favor
the
cancellation
of
this
debt
but
i
see
no
objection
to
adjusting
it
in
accordance
with
the
principle
adopted
for
the
british
debt
our
country
would
not
wish
to
assume
the
role
of
an
oppressive
creditor
but
would
maintain
the
principle
that
financial
obligations
between
nations
are
likewise
moral
obligations
which
international
faith
and
honor
require
should
be
discharged
our
government
has
a
liquidated
claim
against
germany
for
the
expense
of
the
army
of
occupation
of
over
besides
this
the
mixed
claims
commission
have
before
them
about
claims
of
american
citizens
aggregating
about
these
claims
have
already
been
reduced
by
a
recent
decision
but
there
are
valid
claims
reaching
well
toward
our
thousands
of
citizens
with
credits
due
them
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
have
no
redress
save
in
the
action
of
our
government
these
are
very
substantial
interests
which
it
is
the
duty
of
our
government
to
protect
as
best
it
can
that
course
i
propose
to
pursue
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
we
have
a
direct
interest
in
the
economic
recovery
of
europe
they
are
enlarged
by
our
desire
for
the
stability
of
civilization
and
the
welfare
of
humanity
that
we
are
making
sacrifices
to
that
end
none
can
deny
our
deferred
interest
alone
amounts
to
a
million
dollars
every
day
but
recently
we
offered
to
aid
with
our
advice
and
counsel
we
have
reiterated
our
desire
to
see
france
paid
and
germany
revived
we
have
proposed
disarmament
we
have
earnestly
sought
to
compose
differences
and
restore
peace
we
shall
persevere
in
welldoing
not
by
force
but
by
reason
foreign
papers
under
the
law
the
papers
pertaining
to
foreign
relations
to
be
printed
are
transmitted
as
a
part
of
this
message
other
volumes
of
these
papers
will
follow
foreign
service
the
foreign
service
of
our
government
needs
to
be
reorganized
and
improved
fiscal
condition
our
main
problems
are
domestic
problems
financial
stability
is
the
first
requisite
of
sound
government
we
can
not
escape
the
effect
of
world
conditions
we
can
not
avoid
the
inevitable
results
of
the
economic
disorders
which
have
reached
all
nations
but
we
shall
diminish
their
harm
to
us
in
proportion
as
we
continue
to
restore
our
government
finances
to
a
secure
and
endurable
position
this
we
can
and
must
do
upon
that
firm
foundation
rests
the
only
hope
of
progress
and
prosperity
from
that
source
must
come
relief
for
the
people
this
is
being
accomplished
by
a
drastic
but
orderly
retrenchment
which
is
bringing
our
expenses
within
our
means
the
origin
of
this
has
been
the
determination
of
the
american
people
the
main
support
has
been
the
courage
of
those
in
authority
and
the
effective
method
has
been
the
budget
system
the
result
has
involved
real
sacrifice
by
department
heads
but
it
has
been
made
without
flinching
this
system
is
a
law
of
the
congress
it
represents
your
will
it
must
be
maintained
and
ought
to
be
strengthened
by
the
example
of
your
observance
without
a
budget
system
there
can
be
no
fixed
responsibility
and
no
constructive
scientific
economy
this
great
concentration
of
effort
by
the
administration
and
congress
has
brought
the
expenditures
exclusive
of
the
selfsupporting
post
office
department
down
to
three
billion
dollars
it
is
possible
in
consequence
to
make
a
large
reduction
in
the
taxes
of
the
people
which
is
the
sole
object
of
all
curtailment
this
is
treated
at
greater
length
in
the
budget
message
and
a
proposed
plan
has
been
presented
in
detail
in
a
statement
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
has
my
unqualified
approval
i
especially
commend
a
decrease
on
earned
incomes
and
further
abolition
of
admission
message
and
nuisance
taxes
the
amusement
and
educational
value
of
moving
pictures
ought
not
to
be
taxed
diminishing
charges
against
moderate
incomes
from
investment
will
afford
immense
relief
while
a
revision
of
the
surtaxes
will
not
only
provide
additional
money
for
capital
investment
thus
stimulating
industry
and
employing
more
but
will
not
greatly
reduce
the
revenue
from
that
source
and
may
in
the
future
actually
increase
it
being
opposed
to
war
taxes
in
time
of
peace
i
am
not
in
favor
of
excessprofits
taxes
a
very
great
service
could
be
rendered
through
immediate
enactment
of
legislation
relieving
the
people
of
some
of
the
burden
of
taxation
to
reduce
war
taxes
is
to
give
every
home
a
better
chance
for
seven
years
the
people
have
borne
with
uncomplaining
courage
the
tremendous
burden
of
national
and
local
taxation
these
must
both
be
reduced
the
taxes
of
the
nation
must
be
reduced
now
as
much
as
prudence
will
permit
and
expenditures
must
be
reduced
accordingly
high
taxes
reach
everywhere
and
burden
everybody
they
gear
most
heavily
upon
the
poor
they
diminish
indus
try
and
commerce
they
make
agriculture
unprofitable
they
increase
the
rates
on
transportation
they
are
a
charge
on
every
necessary
of
life
of
all
services
which
the
congress
can
render
to
the
country
i
have
no
hesitation
in
declaring
t
neglect
it
to
postpone
it
to
obstruct
it
by
unsound
proposals
is
to
become
unworthy
of
public
confidence
and
untrue
to
public
trust
the
country
wants
this
measure
to
have
the
right
of
way
over
an
others
another
reform
which
is
urgent
in
our
fiscal
system
is
the
abolition
of
the
right
to
issue
taxexempt
securities
the
existing
system
not
only
permits
a
large
amount
of
the
wealth
of
the
notion
to
escape
its
just
burden
but
acts
as
a
continual
stimulant
to
municipal
extravagance
this
should
be
prohibited
by
constitutional
amendment
all
the
wealth
of
the
nation
ought
to
contribute
its
fair
share
to
the
expenses
of
the
nation
tariff
taw
the
present
tariff
law
has
accomplished
its
two
main
objects
it
has
secured
an
abundant
revenue
and
been
productive
of
an
abounding
prosperity
under
it
the
country
has
had
a
very
large
export
and
import
trade
a
constant
revision
of
the
tariff
by
the
congress
is
disturbing
and
harmful
the
present
law
contains
an
elastic
provision
authorizing
the
president
to
increase
or
decrease
present
schedules
not
in
excess
of
per
centum
to
meet
the
difference
in
cost
of
production
at
home
and
abroad
this
does
not
to
my
mind
warrant
a
rewriting
g
of
the
whole
law
but
does
mean
and
will
be
so
administered
that
whenever
the
required
investigation
shows
that
inequalities
of
sufficient
importance
exist
in
any
schedule
the
power
to
change
them
should
and
will
be
applied
shipping
the
entire
well
being
of
our
country
is
dependent
upon
transportation
by
sea
and
land
our
government
during
the
war
acquired
a
large
merchant
fleet
which
should
be
transferred
as
soon
as
possible
to
private
ownership
and
operation
under
conditions
which
would
secure
two
results
first
and
of
prime
importance
adequate
means
for
national
defense
second
adequate
service
to
american
commerce
until
shipping
conditions
are
such
that
our
fleet
can
be
disposed
of
advantageously
under
these
conditions
it
will
be
operated
as
economically
as
possible
under
such
plans
as
may
be
devised
from
time
to
time
by
the
shipping
board
we
must
have
a
merchant
marine
which
meets
these
requirements
and
we
shall
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
its
service
public
improvements
the
time
has
come
to
resume
in
a
moderate
way
the
opening
of
our
intracoastal
waterways
the
control
of
flood
waters
of
the
mississippi
and
of
the
colorado
rivers
the
improvement
of
the
waterways
from
the
great
lakes
toward
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
development
of
the
great
power
and
navigation
project
of
the
st
lawrence
river
for
which
efforts
are
now
being
made
to
secure
the
necessary
treaty
with
canada
these
projects
can
not
all
be
undertaken
at
once
but
all
should
have
the
immediate
consideration
of
the
congress
and
be
adopted
as
fast
as
plans
can
be
matured
and
the
necessary
funds
become
available
this
is
not
incompatible
with
economy
for
their
nature
does
not
require
so
much
a
public
expenditure
as
a
capital
investment
which
will
be
reproductive
as
evidenced
by
the
marked
increase
in
revenue
from
the
panama
canal
upon
these
projects
depend
much
future
industrial
and
agricultural
progress
they
represent
the
protection
of
large
areas
from
flood
and
the
addition
of
a
great
amount
of
cheap
power
and
cheap
freight
by
use
of
navigation
chief
of
which
is
the
bringing
of
oceangoing
ships
to
the
great
lakes
another
problem
of
allied
character
is
the
superpower
development
of
the
northeastern
states
consideration
of
which
is
growing
under
the
direction
of
the
department
of
commerce
by
joint
conference
with
the
local
authorities
railroads
criticism
of
the
railroad
law
has
been
directed
first
to
the
section
laying
down
the
rule
by
which
rates
are
fixed
and
providing
for
payment
to
the
government
and
use
of
excess
earnings
second
to
the
method
for
the
adjustment
of
wage
scales
and
third
to
the
authority
permitting
consolidations
it
has
been
erroneously
assumed
that
the
act
undertakes
to
guarantee
railroad
earnings
the
law
requires
that
rates
should
be
just
and
reasonable
that
has
always
been
the
rule
under
which
rates
have
been
fixed
to
make
a
rate
that
does
not
yield
a
fair
return
results
in
confiscation
and
confiscatory
rates
are
of
course
unconstitutional
unless
the
government
adheres
to
the
rule
of
making
a
rate
that
will
yield
a
fair
return
it
must
abandon
rate
making
altogether
the
new
and
important
feature
of
that
part
of
the
law
is
the
recapture
and
redistribution
of
excess
rates
the
constitutionality
of
this
method
is
now
before
the
supreme
court
for
adjudication
their
decision
should
be
awaited
before
attempting
further
legislation
on
this
subject
furthermore
the
importance
of
this
feature
will
not
be
great
if
consolidation
goes
into
effect
the
settlement
of
railroad
labor
disputes
is
a
matter
of
grave
public
concern
the
labor
board
was
established
to
protect
the
public
in
the
enjoyment
of
continuous
service
by
attempting
to
insure
justice
between
the
companies
and
their
employees
it
has
been
a
great
help
but
is
not
altogether
satisfactory
to
the
public
the
employees
or
the
companies
if
a
substantial
agreement
can
be
reached
among
the
groups
interested
there
should
be
no
hesitation
in
enacting
such
agreement
into
law
if
it
is
not
reached
the
labor
board
may
very
well
be
left
for
the
present
to
protect
the
public
welfare
the
law
for
consolidations
is
not
sufficiently
effective
to
be
expeditious
additional
legislation
is
needed
giving
authority
for
voluntary
consolidations
both
regional
and
route
and
providing
government
machinery
to
aid
and
stimulate
such
action
always
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
this
should
authorize
the
commission
to
appoint
committees
for
each
proposed
group
representing
the
public
and
the
component
roads
with
power
to
negotiate
with
individual
security
holders
for
an
exchange
of
their
securities
for
those
of
the
consolidation
on
such
terms
and
conditions
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
for
avoiding
any
confiscation
and
preserving
fair
values
should
this
permissive
consolidation
prove
ineffective
after
a
limited
period
the
authority
of
the
government
will
have
to
be
directly
invoked
consolidation
appears
to
be
the
only
feasible
method
for
the
maintenance
of
an
adequate
system
of
transportation
with
an
opportunity
so
to
adjust
freight
rates
as
to
meet
such
temporary
conditions
as
now
prevail
in
some
agricultural
sections
competent
authorities
agree
that
an
entire
reorganization
of
the
rate
structure
for
freight
is
necessary
this
should
be
ordered
at
once
by
the
congress
department
of
justice
as
no
revision
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
has
been
made
since
a
commission
or
committee
should
be
created
to
undertake
this
work
the
judicial
council
reports
that
two
more
district
judges
are
needed
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
one
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia
and
two
more
circuit
judges
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
legislation
should
be
considered
for
this
purpose
it
is
desirable
to
expedite
the
hearing
and
disposal
of
cases
a
commission
of
federal
judges
and
lawyers
should
be
created
to
recommend
legislation
by
which
the
procedure
in
the
federal
trial
courts
may
be
simplified
and
regulated
by
rules
of
court
rather
than
by
statute
such
rules
to
be
submitted
to
the
congress
and
to
be
in
force
until
annulled
or
modified
by
the
congress
the
supreme
court
needs
legislation
revising
and
simplifying
the
laws
governing
review
by
that
court
and
enlarging
the
classes
of
cases
of
too
little
public
importance
to
be
subject
to
review
such
reforms
would
expedite
the
transaction
of
the
business
of
the
courts
the
administration
of
justice
is
likely
to
fail
if
it
be
long
delayed
the
national
government
has
never
given
adequate
attention
to
its
prison
problems
it
ought
to
provide
employment
in
such
forms
of
production
as
can
be
used
by
the
government
though
not
sold
to
the
public
in
competition
with
private
business
for
all
prisoners
who
can
be
placed
at
work
and
for
which
they
should
receive
a
reasonable
compensation
available
for
their
dependents
two
independent
reformatories
are
needed
one
for
the
segregation
of
women
and
another
for
the
segregation
of
young
men
serving
their
first
sentence
the
administration
of
justice
would
be
facilitated
greatly
by
including
in
the
bureau
of
investigation
of
the
department
of
justice
a
division
of
criminal
identification
where
there
would
be
collected
this
information
which
is
now
indispensable
in
the
suppression
of
crime
prohibition
the
prohibition
amendment
to
the
constitution
requires
the
congress
and
the
president
to
provide
adequate
laws
to
prevent
its
violation
it
is
my
duty
to
enforce
such
laws
for
that
purpose
a
treaty
is
being
negotiated
with
great
britain
with
respect
to
the
right
of
search
of
hovering
vessels
to
prevent
smuggling
the
coast
card
should
be
greatly
strengthened
and
a
supply
of
swift
power
boats
should
be
provided
the
major
sources
of
production
should
be
rigidly
regulated
and
every
effort
should
be
made
to
suppress
interstate
traffic
with
this
action
on
the
part
of
the
national
government
and
the
cooperation
which
is
usually
rendered
by
municipal
and
state
authorities
prohibition
should
be
made
effective
free
government
has
no
greater
menace
than
disrespect
for
authority
and
continual
violation
of
law
it
is
the
duty
of
a
citizen
not
only
to
observe
the
law
but
to
let
it
be
known
that
he
is
opposed
to
its
violation
the
negro
numbered
among
our
population
are
some
colored
people
under
our
constitution
their
rights
are
just
as
sacred
as
those
of
any
other
citizen
it
is
both
a
public
and
a
private
duty
to
protect
those
rights
the
congress
ought
to
exercise
all
its
powers
of
prevention
and
punishment
against
the
hideous
crime
of
lynching
of
which
the
negroes
are
by
no
means
the
sole
sufferers
but
for
which
they
furnish
a
majorit
y
of
the
victims
already
a
considerable
sum
is
appropriated
to
give
the
negroes
vocational
training
in
agriculture
about
half
a
million
dollars
is
recommended
for
medical
courses
at
howard
university
to
help
contribute
to
the
education
of
colored
doctors
needed
each
year
on
account
of
the
integration
of
large
numbers
into
industrial
centers
it
has
been
proposed
that
a
commission
be
created
composed
of
members
from
both
races
to
formulate
a
better
policy
for
mutual
understanding
and
confidence
such
an
effort
is
to
be
commended
everyone
would
rejoice
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
results
which
it
seeks
but
it
is
well
to
recognize
that
these
difficulties
are
to
a
large
extent
local
problems
which
must
be
worked
out
by
the
mutual
forbearance
and
human
kindness
of
each
community
such
a
method
gives
much
more
promise
of
a
real
remedy
than
outside
interference
civil
service
the
maintenance
and
extension
of
the
classified
civil
service
is
exceedingly
important
there
are
nearly
persons
in
the
executive
civil
service
drawing
about
of
yearly
compensation
fourfifths
of
these
are
in
the
classified
service
this
method
of
selection
of
the
employees
of
the
united
states
is
especially
desirable
for
the
post
office
department
the
civil
service
commission
has
recommended
that
postmasters
at
first
second
and
third
class
offices
be
classified
such
action
accompanied
by
a
repeal
of
the
fouryear
term
of
office
would
undoubtedly
be
an
improvement
i
also
recommend
that
the
field
force
for
prohibition
enforcement
be
brought
within
the
classified
civil
service
without
covering
in
the
present
membership
the
best
method
for
selecting
public
servants
is
the
merit
system
public
buildings
many
of
the
departments
in
washington
need
better
housing
facilities
some
are
so
crowded
that
their
work
is
impeded
others
are
so
scattered
that
they
lose
their
identity
while
i
do
not
favor
at
this
time
a
general
public
building
law
i
believe
it
is
now
necessary
in
accordance
with
plans
already
sanctioned
for
a
unified
and
orderly
system
for
the
development
of
this
city
to
begin
the
carrying
out
of
those
plans
by
authorizing
the
erection
of
three
or
four
buildings
most
urgently
needed
by
an
annual
appropriation
of
regulatory
legislation
cooperation
with
other
maritime
powers
is
necessary
for
complete
protection
of
our
coast
waters
from
pollution
plans
for
this
are
under
way
but
await
certain
experiments
for
refuse
disposal
meantime
laws
prohibiting
spreading
oil
and
oil
refuse
from
vessels
in
our
own
territorial
waters
would
be
most
helpful
against
this
menace
and
should
be
speedily
enacted
laws
should
be
passed
regulating
aviation
revision
is
needed
of
the
laws
regulating
radio
interference
legislation
and
regulations
establishing
load
liner
to
provide
safe
loading
of
vessels
leaving
our
ports
are
necessary
and
recodification
of
our
navigation
laws
is
vital
revision
of
procedure
of
the
federal
trade
commission
will
give
more
constructive
purpose
to
this
department
if
our
alaskan
fisheries
are
to
be
saved
from
destruction
there
must
be
further
legislation
declaring
a
general
policy
and
delegating
the
authority
to
make
rules
and
regulations
to
an
administrative
body
army
and
navy
for
several
years
we
have
been
decreasing
the
personnel
of
the
army
and
navy
and
reducing
their
power
to
the
danger
point
further
reductions
should
not
be
made
the
army
is
a
guarantee
of
the
security
of
our
citizens
at
home
the
navy
is
a
guarantee
of
the
security
of
our
citizens
abroad
both
of
these
services
should
be
strengthened
rather
than
weakened
additional
planes
are
needed
for
the
army
and
additional
submarines
for
the
navy
the
defenses
of
panama
must
be
perfected
we
want
no
more
competitive
armaments
we
want
no
more
war
but
we
want
no
weakness
that
invites
imposition
a
people
who
neglect
their
national
defense
are
putting
in
jeopardy
their
national
honor
insular
possessions
conditions
in
the
insular
possessions
on
the
whole
have
been
good
their
business
has
been
reviving
they
are
being
administered
according
to
law
that
effort
has
the
full
support
of
the
administration
such
recommendations
as
may
conic
from
their
people
or
their
governments
should
have
the
most
considerate
attention
education
and
welfare
our
national
government
is
not
doing
as
much
as
it
legitimately
can
do
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
people
our
enormous
material
wealth
our
institutions
our
whole
form
of
society
can
not
be
considered
fully
successful
until
their
benefits
reach
the
merit
of
every
individual
this
is
not
a
suggestion
that
the
government
should
or
could
assume
for
the
people
the
inevitable
burdens
of
existence
there
is
no
method
by
which
we
can
either
be
relieved
of
the
results
of
our
own
folly
or
be
guaranteed
a
successful
life
there
is
an
inescapable
personal
responsibility
for
the
development
of
character
of
industry
of
thrift
and
of
selfcontrol
these
do
not
come
from
the
government
but
from
the
people
themselves
but
the
government
can
and
should
always
be
expressive
of
steadfast
determination
always
vigilant
to
maintain
conditions
under
which
these
virtues
are
most
likely
to
develop
and
secure
recognition
and
reward
this
is
the
american
policy
it
is
in
accordance
with
this
principle
that
we
have
enacted
laws
for
the
protection
of
the
public
health
and
have
adopted
prohibition
in
narcotic
drugs
and
intoxicating
liquors
for
purposes
of
national
uniformity
we
ought
to
provide
by
constitutional
amendment
and
appropriate
legislation
for
a
limitation
of
child
labor
and
in
all
cases
under
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
a
minimum
wage
law
for
women
which
would
undoubtedly
find
sufficient
power
of
enforcement
in
the
influence
of
public
opinion
having
in
mind
that
education
is
peculiarly
a
local
problem
and
that
it
should
always
be
pursued
with
the
largest
freedom
of
choice
by
students
and
parents
nevertheless
the
federal
government
might
well
give
the
benefit
of
its
counsel
and
encouragement
more
freely
in
this
direction
if
anyone
doubts
the
need
of
concerted
action
by
the
states
of
the
nation
for
this
purpose
it
is
only
necessary
to
consider
the
appalling
figures
of
illiteracy
representing
a
condition
which
does
not
vary
much
in
all
parts
of
the
union
i
do
not
favor
the
making
of
appropriations
from
the
national
treasury
to
be
expended
directly
on
local
education
but
i
do
consider
it
a
fundamental
requirement
of
national
activity
which
accompanied
by
allied
subjects
of
welfare
is
worthy
of
a
separate
department
and
a
place
in
the
cabinet
the
humanitarian
side
of
government
should
not
be
repressed
but
should
be
cultivated
mere
intelligence
however
is
not
enough
enlightenment
must
be
accompanied
by
that
moral
power
which
is
the
product
of
the
home
and
of
rebellion
real
education
and
true
welfare
for
the
people
rest
inevitably
on
this
foundation
which
the
government
can
approve
and
commend
but
which
the
people
themselves
must
create
immigration
american
institutions
rest
solely
on
good
citizenship
they
were
created
by
people
who
had
a
background
of
selfgovernment
new
arrivals
should
be
limited
to
our
capacity
to
absorb
them
into
the
ranks
of
good
citizenship
america
must
be
kept
american
for
this
purpose
it
is
necessary
to
continue
a
policy
of
restricted
immigration
it
would
be
well
to
make
such
immigration
of
a
selective
nature
with
some
inspection
at
the
source
and
based
either
on
a
prior
census
or
upon
the
record
of
naturalization
either
method
would
insure
the
admission
of
those
with
the
largest
capacity
and
best
intention
of
becoming
citizens
i
am
convinced
that
our
present
economic
and
social
conditions
warrant
a
limitation
of
those
to
be
admitted
we
should
find
additional
safety
in
a
law
requiring
the
immediate
registration
of
all

those

veterans
no
more
important
duty
falls
on
the
government
of
the
united
states
than
the
adequate
care
of
its
veterans
those
suffering
disabilities
incurred
in
the
service
must
have
sufficient
hospital
relief
and
compensation
their
dependents
must
be
supported
rehabilitation
and
vocational
training
must
be
completed
all
of
this
service
must
be
clean
must
be
prompt
and
effective
and
it
must
be
administered
in
a
spirit
of
the
broadest
and
deepest
human
sympathy
if
investigation
reveals
any
present
defects
of
administration
or
need
of
legislation
orders
will
be
given
for
the
immediate
correction
of
administration
and
recommendations
for
legislation
should
be
given
the
highest
preference
at
present
there
are
vacant
beds
in
government
hospitals
i
recommend
that
all
hospitals
be
authorized
at
once
to
receive
and
care
for
without
hospital
pay
the
veterans
of
all
wars
needing
such
care
whenever
there
are
vacant
beds
and
that
immediate
steps
be
taken
to
enlarge
and
build
new
hospitals
to
serve
all
such
cases
the
american
legion
will
present
to
the
congress
a
legislative
program
too
extensive
for
detailed
discussion
here
it
is
a
carefully
matured
plan
while
some
of
it
i
do
not
favor
with
much
of
it
i
am
in
hearty
accord
and
i
recommend
that
a
most
painstaking
effort
be
made
to
provide
remedies
for
any
defects
in
the
administration
of
the
present
laws
which
their
experience
has
revealed
the
attitude
of
the
government
toward
these
proposals
should
be
one
of
generosity
but
i
do
not
favor
the
granting
of
a
bonus
coal
the
cost
of
coal
has
become
unbearably
high
it
places
a
great
burden
on
our
industrial
and
domestic
life
the
public
welfare
requires
a
reduction
in
the
price
of
fuel
with
the
enormous
deposits
in
existence
failure
of
supply
ought
not
to
be
tolerated
those
responsible
for
the
conditions
in
this
industry
should
undertake
its
reform
and
free
it
from
any
charge
of
profiteering
the
report
of
the
coal
commission
will
be
before
the
congress
it
comprises
all
the
facts
it
represents
the
mature
deliberations
and
conclusions
of
the
best
talent
and
experience
that
ever
made
a
national
survey
of
the
production
and
distribution
of
fuel
i
do
not
favor
government
ow
nership
or
operation
of
coal
mines
the
need
is
for
action
under
private
ownership
that
will
secure
greater
continuity
of
production
and
greater
public
protection
the
federal
government
probably
has
no
peacetime
authority
to
regulate
wages
prices
or
profits
in
coal
at
the
mines
or
among
dealers
but
by
ascertaining
and
publishing
facts
it
can
exercise
great
influence
the
source
of
the
difficulty
in
the
bituminous
coal
fields
is
the
intermittence
of
operation
which
causes
great
waste
of
both
capital
and
labor
that
part
of
the
report
dealing
with
this
problem
has
much
significance
and
is
suggestive
of
necessary
remedies
by
amending
the
car
rules
by
encouraging
greater
unity
of
ownership
and
possibly
by
permitting
common
selling
agents
for
limited
districts
on
condition
that
they
accept
adequate
regulations
and
guarantee
that
competition
between
districts
be
unlimited
distribution
storage
and
continuity
ought
to
be
improved
the
supply
of
coal
must
be
constant
in
case
of
its
prospective
interruption
the
president
should
have
authority
to
appoint
a
commission
empowered
to
deal
with
whatever
emergency
situation
might
arise
to
aid
conciliation
and
voluntary
arbitration
to
adjust
any
existing
or
threatened
controversy
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
when
collective
bargaining
fails
and
by
controlling
distribution
to
prevent
profiteering
in
this
vital
necessity
this
legislation
is
exceedingly
urgent
and
essential
to
the
exercise
of
national
authority
for
the
protection
of
the
people
those
who
undertake
the
responsibility
of
management
or
employment
in
this
industry
do
so
with
the
full
knowledge
that
the
public
interest
is
paramount
and
that
to
fail
through
any
motive
of
selfishness
in
its
service
is
such
a
betrayal
of
duty
as
warrants
uncompromising
action
by
the
government
reorganization
a
special
joint
committee
has
been
appointed
to
work
out
a
plan
for
a
reorganization
of
the
different
departments
and
bureaus
of
the
government
more
scientific
and
economical
than
the
present
system
with
the
exception
of
the
consolidation
of
the
war
and
navy
departments
and
some
minor
details
the
plan
has
the
general
sanction
of
the
president
and
the
cabinet
it
is
important
that
reorganization
be
enacted
into
law
at
the
present
session
agriculture
aided
by
the
sound
principles
adopted
by
the
government
the
business
of
the
country
has
had
an
extraordinary
revival
looked
at
as
a
whole
the
nation
is
in
the
enjoyment
of
remarkable
prosperity
industry
and
commerce
are
thriving
for
the
most
tart
agriculture
is
successful
eleven
staples
having
risen
in
value
from
about
two
years
ago
to
about
for
the
current
year
but
range
cattle
are
still
low
in
price
and
some
sections
of
the
wheat
area
notably
minnesota
north
dakota
and
on
west
have
many
cases
of
actual
distress
with
his
products
not
selling
on
a
parity
with
the
products
of
industry
every
sound
remedy
that
can
be
devised
should
be
applied
for
the
relief
of
the
farmer
he
represents
a
character
a
type
of
citizenship
and
a
public
necessity
that
must
be
preserved
and
afforded
every
facility
for
regaining
prosperity
the
distress
is
most
acute
among
those
wholly
dependent
upon
one
crop
wheat
acreage
was
greatly
expanded
and
has
not
yet
been
sufficiently
reduced
a
large
amount
is
raised
for
export
which
has
to
meet
the
competition
in
the
world
market
of
large
amounts
raised
on
land
much
cheaper
and
much
more
productive
no
complicated
scheme
of
relief
no
plan
for
government
fixing
of
prices
no
resort
to
the
public
treasury
will
be
of
any
permanent
value
in
establishing
agriculture
simple
and
direct
methods
put
into
operation
by
the
farmer
himself
are
the
only
real
sources
for
restoration
indirectly
the
farmer
must
be
relieved
by
a
reduction
of
national
and
local
taxation
he
must
be
assisted
by
the
reorganization
of
the
freightrate
structure
which
could
reduce
charges
on
his
production
to
make
this
fully
effective
there
ought
to
be
railroad
consolidations
cheaper
fertilizers
must
be
provided
he
must
have
organization
his
customer
with
whom
he
exchanges
products
o
he
farm
for
those
of
industry
is
organized
labor
is
organized
business
is
organized
and
there
is
no
way
for
agriculture
to
meet
this
unless
it
too
is
organized
the
acreage
of
wheat
is
too
large
unless
we
can
meet
the
world
market
at
a
profit
we
must
stop
raising
for
export
organization
would
help
to
reduce
acreage
systems
of
cooperative
marketing
created
by
the
farmers
themselves
supervised
by
competent
management
without
doubt
would
be
of
assistance
but
the
can
not
wholly
solve
the
problem
our
agricultural
schools
ought
to
have
thorough
courses
in
the
theory
of
organization
and
cooperative
marketing
diversification
is
necessary
those
farmers
who
raise
their
living
on
their
land
are
not
greatly
in
distress
such
loans
as
are
wisely
needed
to
assist
buying
stock
and
other
materials
to
start
in
this
direction
should
be
financed
through
a
government
agency
as
a
temporary
and
emergency
expedient
the
remaining
difficulty
is
the
disposition
of
exportable
wheat
i
do
not
favor
the
permanent
interference
of
the
government
in
this
problem
that
probably
would
increase
the
trouble
by
increasing
production
but
it
seems
feasible
to
provide
government
assistance
to
exports
and
authority
should
be
given
the
war
finance
corporation
to
grant
in
its
discretion
the
most
liberal
terms
of
payment
for
fats
and
grains
exported
for
the
direct
benefit
of
the
farm
muscle
shoals
the
government
is
undertaking
to
develop
a
great
waterpower
project
known
as
muscle
shoals
on
which
it
has
expended
many
million
dollars
the
work
is
still
going
on
subject
to
the
right
to
retake
in
time
of
war
i
recommend
that
this
property
with
a
location
for
auxiliary
steam
plant
and
rights
of
way
be
sold
this
would
end
the
present
burden
of
expense
and
should
return
to
the
treasury
the
largest
price
possible
to
secure
while
the
price
is
an
important
element
there
is
another
consideration
even
more
compelling
the
agriculture
of
the
nation
needs
a
greater
supply
and
lower
cost
of
fertilizer
this
is
now
imported
in
large
quantities
the
best
information
i
can
secure
indicates
that
present
methods
of
power
production
would
not
be
able
profitably
to
meet
the
price
at
which
these
imports
can
be
sold
to
obtain
a
supply
from
this
water
power
would
require
long
and
costly
experimentation
to
perfect
a
process
for
cheap
production
otherwise
our
purpose
would
fail
completely
it
seems
desirable
therefore
in
order
to
protect
and
promote
the
public
welfare
to
have
adequate
covenants
that
such
experimentation
be
made
and
carried
on
to
success
the
great
advantage
of
lowpriced
nitrates
must
be
secured
for
the
direct
benefit
of
the
farmers
and
the
indirect
benefit
of
the
public
in
time
of
peace
and
of
the
government
in
time
of
war
if
this
main
object
be
accomplished
the
amount
of
money
received
for
the
property
is
not
a
primary
or
major
consideration
such
a
solution
will
involve
complicated
negotiations
and
there
is
no
authority
for
that
purpose
i
therefore
recommend
that
the
congress
appoint
a
small
joint
committee
to
consider
offers
conduct
negotiations
and
report
definite
recommendations
reclamation
by
reason
of
many
contributing
causes
occupants
of
our
reclamation
projects
are
in
financial
difficulties
which
in
some
cases
are
acute
relief
should
be
granted
by
definite
authority
of
law
empowering
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
his
discretion
to
suspend
readjust
and
reassess
all
charges
against
water
users
this
whole
question
is
being
considered
by
experts
you
will
have
the
advantage
of
the
facts
and
conclusions
which
they
may
develop
this
situation
involving
a
government
investment
of
more
than
and
affecting
more
than
water
users
is
serious
while
relief
which
is
necessary
should
be
granted
yet
contracts
with
the
government
which
can
be
met
should
be
met
the
established
general
policy
of
these
projects
should
not
be
abandoned
for
any
private
control
highways
and
forests
highways
and
reforestation
should
continue
to
have
the
interest
and
support
of
the
government
everyone
is
anxious
for
good
highways
i
have
made
a
liberal
proposal
in
the
budget
for
the
continuing
payment
to
the
states
by
the
federal
government
of
its
share
for
this
necessary
public
improvement
no
expenditure
of
public
money
contributes
so
much
to
the
national
wealth
as
for
building
good
roads
reforestation
has
an
importance
far
above
the
attention
it
usually
secures
a
special
committee
of
the
senate
is
investigating
this
need
and
i
shall
welcome
a
constructive
policy
based
on
their
report
it
is
years
since
our
country
announced
the
monroe
doctrine
this
principle
has
been
ever
since
and
is
now
one
of
the
main
foundations
of
our
foreign
relations
it
must
be
maintained
but
in
maintaining
it
we
must
not
be
forgetful
that
a
great
change
has
taken
place
we
are
no
longer
a
weak
nation
thinking
mainly
of
defense
dreading
foreign
imposition
we
are
great
and
powerful
new
powers
bring
new
responsibilities
our
ditty
then
was
to
protect
ourselves
added
to
that
our
duty
now
is
to
help
give
stability
to
the
world
we
want
idealism
we
want
that
vision
which
lifts
men
and
nations
above
themselves
these
are
virtues
by
reason
of
their
own
merit
but
they
must
not
be
cloistered
they
must
not
be
impractical
they
must
not
be
ineffective
the
world
has
had
enough
of
the
curse
of
hatred
and
selfishness
of
destruction
and
war
it
has
had
enough
of
the
wrongful
use
of
material
power
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
there
must
be
good
will
and
charity
confidence
and
peace
the
time
has
come
for
a
more
practical
use
of
moral
power
and
more
reliance
upon
the
principle
that
right
makes
its
own
might
our
authority
among
the
nations
must
be
represented
by
justice
and
mercy
it
is
necessary
not
only
to
have
faith
but
to
make
sacrifices
for
our
faith
the
spiritual
forces
of
the
world
make
all
its
final
determinations
it
is
with
these
voices
that
america
should
speak
whenever
they
declare
a
righteous
purpose
there
need
be
no
doubt
that
they
will
be
heard
america
has
taken
her
p
lace
in
the
world
as
a
republicfree
independent
powerful
the
best
service
that
can
be
rendered
to
humanity
is
the
assurance
that
this
place
will
be
maintained

members
of
the
congress
so
many
problems
are
calling
for
solution
that
a
recital
of
all
of
them
in
the
face
of
the
known
limitations
of
a
short
session
of
congress
would
seem
to
lack
sincerity
of
purpose
it
is
four
years
since
the
world
war
ended
but
the
inevitable
readjustment
of
the
social
and
economic
order
is
not
more
than
barely
begun
there
is
no
acceptance
of
prewar
conditions
anywhere
in
the
world
in
a
very
general
way
humanity
harbors
individual
wishes
to
go
on
with
wartime
compensation
for
production
with
prewar
requirements
in
expenditure
in
short
everyone
speaking
broadly
craves
readjustment
for
everybody
except
himself
while
there
can
be
no
just
and
permanent
readjustment
except
when
all
participate
the
civilization
which
measured
its
strength
of
genius
and
the
power
of
science
and
the
resources
of
industries
in
addition
to
testing
the
limits
of
man
power
and
the
endurance
and
heroism
of
men
and
womenthat
same
civilization
is
brought
to
its
severest
test
in
restoring
a
tranquil
order
and
committing
humanity
to
the
stable
ways
of
peace
if
the
sober
and
deliberate
appraisal
of
prewar
civilization
makes
it
seem
a
worthwhile
inheritance
then
with
patience
and
good
courage
it
will
be
preserved
there
never
again
will
be
precisely
the
old
order
indeed
i
know
of
no
one
who
thinks
it
to
be
desirable
for
out
of
the
old
order
came
the
war
itself
and
the
new
order
established
and
made
secure
never
will
permit
its
recurrence
it
is
no
figure
of
speech
to
say
we
have
come
to
the
test
of
our
civilization
the
world
has
been
passingis
today
passing
through
of
a
great
crisis
the
conduct
of
war
itself
is
not
more
difficult
than
the
solution
of
the
problems
which
necessarily
follow
i
am
not
speaking
at
this
moment
of
the
problem
in
its
wider
aspect
of
world
rehabilitation
or
of
international
relationships
the
reference
is
to
our
own
social
financial
and
economic
problems
at
home
these
things
are
not
to
be
considered
solely
as
problems
apart
from
all
international
relationship
but
every
nation
must
be
able
to
carry
on
for
itself
else
its
international
relationship
will
have
scant
importance
doubtless
our
own
people
have
emerged
from
the
world
war
tumult
less
impaired
than
most
belligerent
powers
probably
we
have
made
larger
progress
toward
reconstruction
surely
we
have
been
fortunate
in
diminishing
unemployment
and
our
industrial
and
business
activities
which
are
the
lifeblood
of
our
material
existence
have
been
restored
as
in
no
other
reconstruction
period
of
like
length
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
we
escaped
the
coal
and
railway
strikes
which
had
no
excuse
for
their
beginning
and
less
justification
for
their
delayed
settlement
we
should
have
done
infinitely
better
but
labor
was
insistent
on
holding
to
the
war
heights
and
heedless
forces
of
reaction
sought
the
prewar
levels
and
both
were
wrong
in
the
folly
of
conflict
our
progress
was
hindered
and
the
heavy
cost
has
not
yet
been
fully
estimated
there
can
be
neither
adjustment
nor
the
penalty
of
the
failure
to
readjust
in
which
all
do
not
somehow
participate
the
railway
strike
accentuated
the
difficulty
of
the
american
farmer
the
first
distress
of
readjustment
came
to
the
farmer
and
it
will
not
be
a
readjustment
fit
to
abide
until
he
is
relieved
the
distress
brought
to
the
farmer
does
not
affect
him
alone
agricultural
ill
fortune
is
a
national
ill
fortune
that
onefourth
of
our
population
which
produces
the
food
of
the
republic
and
adds
so
largely
to
our
export
commerce
must
participate
in
the
good
fortunes
of
the
nation
else
there
is
none
worth
retaining
agriculture
is
a
vital
activity
in
our
national
life
in
it
we
had
our
beginning
and
its
westward
march
with
the
star
of
the
empire
has
reflected
the
growth
of
the
republic
it
has
its
vicissitudes
which
no
legislation
will
prevent
its
hardships
for
which
no
law
can
provide
escape
but
the
congress
can
make
available
to
the
farmer
the
financial
facilities
which
have
been
built
up
under
government
aid
and
supervision
for
other
commercial
and
industrial
enterprises
it
may
be
done
on
the
same
solid
fundamentals
and
make
the
vitally
important
agricultural
industry
more
secure
and
it
must
be
done
this
congress
already
has
taken
cognizance
of
the
misfortune
which
precipitate
deflation
brought
to
american
agriculture
your
measures
of
relief
and
the
reduction
of
the
federal
reserve
discount
rate
undoubtedly
saved
the
country
from
widespread
disaster
the
very
proof
of
helpfulness
already
given
is
the
strongest
argument
for
the
permanent
establishment
of
widened
credits
heretofore
temporarily
extended
through
the
war
finance
corporation
the
farm
loan
bureau
which
already
has
proven
its
usefulness
through
the
federal
land
banks
may
well
have
its
powers
enlarged
to
provide
ample
farm
production
credits
as
well
as
enlarged
land
credits
it
is
entirely
practical
to
create
a
division
in
the
federal
land
banks
to
deal
with
production
credits
with
the
limitations
of
time
so
adjusted
to
the
farm
turnover
as
the
federal
reserve
system
provides
for
the
turnover
in
the
manufacturing
and
mercantile
world
special
provision
must
be
made
for
livestock
production
credits
and
the
limit
of
land
loans
may
be
safely
enlarged
various
measures
are
pending
before
you
and
the
best
judgment
of
congress
ought
to
be
expressed
in
a
prompt
enactment
at
the
present
session
but
american
agriculture
needs
more
than
added
credit
facilities
the
credits
will
help
to
solve
the
pressing
problems
growing
out
of
warinflated
land
values
and
the
drastic
deflation
of
three
years
ago
but
permanent
and
deserved
agricultural
good
fortune
depends
on
better
and
cheaper
transportation
here
is
an
outstanding
problem
demanding
the
most
rigorous
consideration
of
the
congress
and
the
country
it
has
to
do
with
more
than
agriculture
it
provides
the
channel
for
the
flow
of
the
countrys
commerce
but
the
farmer
is
particularly
hard
hit
his
market
so
affected
by
the
world
consumption
does
not
admit
of
the
price
adjustment
to
meet
carrying
charges
in
the
last
half
of
the
year
now
closing
the
railways
broken
in
carrying
capacity
because
of
motive
power
and
rolling
stock
out
of
order
though
insistently
declaring
to
the
contrary
embargoed
his
shipments
or
denied
him
cars
when
fortunate
markets
were
calling
too
frequently
transportation
failed
while
perishable
products
were
turning
from
possible
profit
to
losses
counted
in
tens
of
millions
i
know
of
no
problem
exceeding
in
importance
this
one
of
transportation
in
our
complex
and
interdependent
modern
life
transportation
is
essential
to
our
very
existence
let
us
pass
for
the
moment
the
menace
in
the
possible
paralysis
of
such
service
as
we
have
and
note
the
failure
for
whatever
reason
to
expand
our
transportation
to
meet
the
nations
needs
the
census
of
recorded
a
population
of
in
two
decades
more
we
may
reasonably
expect
to
count
thrice
that
number
in
the
three
decades
ending
in
the
countrys
freight
by
rail
increased
from
tons
to
tons
that
is
to
say
while
our
population
was
increasing
less
than
per
cent
the
freight
movement
increased
over
per
cent
we
have
built
per
cent
of
the
worlds
railroad
mileage
and
yet
find
it
inadequate
to
our
present
requirements
when
we
contemplate
the
inadequacy
of
today
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
the
next
few
decades
will
witness
the
paralysis
of
our
transportationusing
social
scheme
or
a
complete
reorganization
on
some
new
basis
mindful
of
the
tremendous
costs
of
betterments
extensions
and
expansions
and
mindful
of
the
staggering
debts
of
the
world
today
the
difficulty
is
magnified
here
is
a
problem
demanding
wide
vision
and
the
avoidance
of
mere
makeshifts
no
matter
what
the
errors
of
the
past
no
matter
how
we
acclaimed
construction
and
then
condemned
operations
in
the
past
we
have
the
transportation
and
the
honest
investment
in
the
transportation
which
sped
us
on
to
what
we
are
and
we
face
conditions
which
reflect
its
inadequacy
today
its
greater
inadequacy
tomorrow
and
we
contemplate
transportation
costs
which
much
of
the
traffic
can
not
and
will
not
continue
to
pay
manifestly
we
have
need
to
begin
on
plans
to
coordinate
all
transportation
facilities
we
should
more
effectively
connect
up
our
rail
lines
with
our
carriers
by
sea
we
ought
to
reap
some
benefit
from
the
hundreds
of
millions
expended
on
inland
waterways
proving
our
capacity
to
utilize
as
well
as
expend
we
ought
to
turn
the
motor
truck
into
a
railway
feeder
and
distributor
instead
of
a
destroying
competitor
it
would
be
folly
to
ignore
that
we
live
in
a
motor
age
the
motor
car
reflects
our
standard
of
living
and
gauges
the
speed
of
our
presentday
life
it
long
ago
ran
down
simple
living
and
never
halted
to
inquire
about
the
prostrate
figure
which
fell
as
its
victim
with
full
recognition
of
motorcar
transportation
we
must
turn
it
to
the
most
practical
use
it
can
not
supersede
the
railway
lines
no
matter
how
generously
we
afford
it
highways
out
of
the
public
treasury
if
freight
traffic
by
motor
were
charged
with
its
proper
and
proportionate
share
of
highway
construction
we
should
find
much
of
it
wasteful
and
more
costly
than
like
service
by
rail
yet
we
have
paralleled
the
railways
a
most
natural
line
of
construction
and
thereby
taken
away
from
the
agency
of
expected
service
much
of
its
profitable
traffic
which
the
taxpayers
have
been
providing
the
highways
whose
cost
of
maintenance
is
not
yet
realized
the
federal
government
has
a
right
to
inquire
into
the
wisdom
of
this
policy
because
the
national
treasury
is
contributing
largely
to
this
highway
construction
costly
highways
ought
to
be
made
to
serve
as
feeders
rather
than
competitors
of
the
railroads
and
the
motor
truck
should
become
a
coordinate
factor
in
our
great
distributing
system
this
transportation
problem
can
not
be
waived
aside
the
demand
for
lowered
costs
on
farm
products
and
basic
materials
can
not
be
ignored
rates
horizontally
increased
to
meet
increased
wage
outlays
during
the
war
inflation
are
not
easily
reduced
when
some
very
moderate
wage
reductions
were
effected
last
summer
there
was
a

per
cent
horizontal
reduction
in
rates
i
sought
at
that
time
in
a
very
informal
way
to
have
the
railway
managers
go
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
agree
to
a
heavier
reduction
on
farm
products
and
coal
and
other
basic
commodities
and
leave
unchanged
the
freight
tariffs
which
a
very
large
portion
of
the
traffic
was
able
to
bear
neither
the
managers
nor
the
commission
tile
suggestion
so
we
had
the
horizontal
reduction
saw
fit
to
adopt
too
slight
to
be
felt
by
the
higher
class
cargoes
and
too
little
to
benefit
the
heavy
tonnage
calling
most
loudly
for
relief
railways
are
not
to
be
expected
to
render
the
most
essential
service
in
our
social
organization
without
a
air
return
on
capital
invested
but
the
government
has
gone
so
far
in
the
regulation
of
rates
and
rules
of
operation
that
it
has
the
responsibility
of
pointing
the
way
to
the
reduced
freight
costs
so
essential
to
our
national
welfare
government
operation
does
not
afford
the
cure
it
was
government
operation
which
brought
us
to
the
very
order
of
things
against
which
we
now
rebel
and
we
are
still
liquidating
the
costs
of
that
supreme
folly
surely
the
genius
of
the
railway
builders
has
not
become
extinct
among
the
railway
managers
new
economies
new
efficiencies
in
cooperation
must
be
found
the
fact
that
labor
takes
to
per
cent
of
total
railway
earnings
makes
limitations
within
which
to
effect
economies
very
difficult
but
the
demand
is
no
less
insistent
on
that
account
clearly
the
managers
are
without
that
intercarrier
cooperative
relationship
so
highly
essential
to
the
best
and
most
economical
operation
they
could
not
function
in
harmony
when
the
strike
threatened
the
paralysis
of
all
railway
transportation
the
relationship
of
the
service
to
public
welfare
so
intimately
affected
by
state
and
federal
regulation
demands
the
effective
correlation
and
a
concerted
drive
to
meet
an
insistent
and
justified
public
demand
the
merger
of
lines
into
systems
a
facilitated
interchange
of
freight
cars
the
economic
use
of
terminals
and
the
consolidation
of
facilities
are
suggested
ways
of
economy
and
efficiency
i
remind
you
that
congress
provided
a
joint
commission
of
agricultural
inquiry
which
made
an
exhaustive
investigation
of
car
service
and
transportation
and
unanimously
recommended
in
its
report
of
october
the
pooling
of
freight
cars
under
a
central
agency
this
report
well
deserves
your
serious
consideration
i
think
well
of
the
central
agency
which
shall
be
a
creation
of
the
railways
themselves
to
provide
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
means
for
financing
equipment
for
carriers
which
are
otherwise
unable
to
provide
their
proportion
of
car
equipment
adequate
to
transportation
needs
this
same
agency
ought
to
point
the
way
to
every
possible
economy
in
maintained
equipment
and
the
necessary
interchanges
in
railway
commerce
in
a
previous
address
to
the
congress
i
called
to
your
attention
the
insufficiency
of
power
to
enforce
the
decisions
of
the
railroad
labor
board
carriers
have
ignored
its
decisions
on
the
one
hand
railway
workmen
have
challenged
its
decisions
by
a
strike
on
the
other
hand
the
intent
of
congress
to
establish
a
tribunal
to
which
railway
labor
and
managers
may
appeal
respecting
questions
of
wages
and
working
conditions
can
not
be
too
strongly
commended
it
is
vitally
important
that
some
such
agency
should
be
a
guaranty
against
suspended
operation
the
public
must
be
spared
even
the
threat
of
discontinued
service
sponsoring
the
railroads
as
we
do
it
is
an
obligation
that
labor
shall
be
assured
the
highest
justice
and
every
proper
consideration
of
wage
and
working
conditions
but
it
is
an
equal
obligation
to
see
that
no
concerted
action
in
forcing
demands
shall
deprive
the
public
of
the
transportation
service
essential
to
its
very
existence
it
is
now
impossible
to
safeguard
public
interest
because
the
decrees
of
the
board
are
unenforceable
against
either
employer
or
employee
the
labor
board
itself
is
not
so
constituted
as
best
to
serve
the
public
interest
with
six
partisan
members
on
a
board
of
nine
three
partisans
nominated
by
the
employees
and
three
by
the
railway
managers
it
is
inevitable
that
the
partisan
viewpoint
is
maintained
throughout
hearings
and
in
decisions
handed
down
indeed
the
few
exceptions
to
a
strictly
partisan
expression
in
decisions
thus
far
rendered
have
been
followed
by
accusations
of
betrayal
of
the
partisan
interests
represented
only
the
public
group
of
three
is
free
to
function
in
unbiased
decisions
therefore
the
partisan
membership
may
well
be
abolished
and
decisions
should
be
made
by
an
impartial
tribunal
i
am
well
convinced
that
the
functions
of
this
tribunal
could
be
much
better
carried
on
here
in
washington
even
were
it
to
be
continued
as
a
separate
tribunal
there
ought
to
be
contact
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
has
supreme
authority
in
the
rate
making
to
which
wage
cost
bears
an
indissoluble
relationship
theoretically
a
fair
and
living
wage
must
be
determined
quite
apart
from
the
employers
earning
capacity
but
in
practice
in
the
railway
service
they
are
inseparable
the
record
of
advanced
rates
to
meet
increased
wages
both
determined
by
the
government
is
proof
enough
the
substitution
of
a
labor
division
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
made
up
from
its
membership
to
hear
and
decide
disputes
relating
to
wages
and
working
conditions
which
have
failed
of
adjustment
by
proper
committees
created
by
the
railways
and
their
employees
offers
a
more
effective
plan
it
need
not
be
surprising
that
there
is
dissatisfaction
over
delayed
hearings
and
decisions
by
the
present
board
when
every
trivial
dispute
is
carried
to
that
tribunal
the
law
should
require
the
railroads
and
their
employees
to
institute
means
and
methods
to
negotiate
between
themselves
their
constantly
arising
differences
limiting
appeals
to
the
government
tribunal
to
disputes
of
such
character
as
are
likely
to
affect
the
public
welfare
this
suggested
substitution
will
involve
a
necessary
increase
in
the
membership
of
the
commission
probably
four
to
constitute
the
labor
division
if
the
suggestion
appeals
to
the
congress
it
will
be
well
to
specify
that
the
labor
division
shall
be
constituted
of
representatives
of
the
four
ratemaking
territories
thereby
assuring
a
tribunal
conversant
with
the
conditions
which
obtain
in
the
different
ratemaking
sections
of
the
country
i
wish
i
could
bring
to
you
the
precise
recommendation
for
the
prevention
of
strikes
which
threaten
the
welfare
of
the
people
and
menace
public
safety
it
is
an
impotent
civilization
and
an
inadequate
government
which
lacks
the
genius
and
the
courage
to
guard
against
such
a
menace
to
public
welfare
as
we
experienced
last
summer
you
were
aware
of
the
governments
great
concern
and
its
futile
attempt
to
aid
in
an
adjustment
it
will
reveal
the
inexcusable
obstinacy
which
was
responsible
for
so
much
distress
to
the
country
to
recall
now
that
though
all
disputes
are
not
yet
adjusted
the
many
settlements
which
have
been
made
were
on
the
terms
which
the
government
proposed
in
mediation
public
interest
demands
that
ample
power
shall
be
conferred
upon
the
labor
tribunal
whether
it
is
the
present
board
or
the
suggested
substitute
to
require
its
rulings
to
be
accepted
by
both
parties
to
a
disputed
question
let
there
be
no
confusion
about
the
purpose
of
the
suggested
conferment
of
power
to
make
decisions
effective
there
can
be
no
denial
of
constitutional
rights
of
either
railway
workmen
or
railway
managers
no
man
can
be
denied
his
right
to
labor
when
and
how
he
chooses
or
cease
to
labor
when
he
so
elects
but
since
the
government
assumes
to
safeguard
his
interests
while
employed
in
an
essential
public
service
the
security
of
society
itself
demands
his
retirement
from
the
service
shall
not
be
so
timed
and
related
as
to
effect
the
destruction
of
that
service
this
vitally
essential
public
transportation
service
demanding
so
much
of
brain
and
brawn
so
much
for
efficiency
and
security
ought
to
offer
the
most
attractive
working
conditions
and
the
highest
of
wages
paid
to
workmen
in
any
employment
in
essentially
every
branch
from
track
repairer
to
the
man
at
the
locomotive
throttle
the
railroad
worker
is
responsible
for
the
safety
of
human
lives
and
the
care
of
vast
property
his
high
responsibility
might
well
rate
high
his
pay
within
the
limits
the
traffic
will
bear
but
the
same
responsibility
plus
governmental
protection
may
justly
deny
him
and
his
associates
a
withdrawal
from
service
without
a
warning
or
under
circumstances
which
involve
the
paralysis
of
necessary
transportation
we
have
assumed
so
great
a
responsibility
in
necessary
regulation
that
we
unconsciously
have
assumed
the
responsibility
for
maintained
service
therefore
the
lawful
power
for
the
enforcement
of
decisions
is
necessary
to
sustain
the
majesty
of
government
and
to
administer
to
the
public
welfare
during
its
longer
session
the
present
congress
enacted
a
new
tariff
law
the
protection
of
the
american
standards
of
living
demanded
the
insurance
it
provides
against
the
distorted
conditions
of
world
commerce
the
framers
of
the
law
made
provision
for
a
certain
flexibility
of
customs
duties
whereby
it
is
possible
to
readjust
them
as
developing
conditions
may
require
the
enactment
has
imposed
a
large
responsibility
upon
the
executive
but
that
responsibility
will
be
discharged
with
a
broad
mindfulness
of
the
whole
business
situation
the
provision
itself
admits
either
the
possible
fallibility
of
rates
or
their
unsuitableness
to
changing
conditions
i
believe
the
grant
of
authority
may
be
promptly
and
discreetly
exercised
ever
mindful
of
the
intent
and
purpose
to
safeguard
american
industrial
activity
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
the
exploitation
of
the
american
consumer
and
keep
open
the
paths
of
such
liberal
exchanges
as
do
not
endanger
our
own
productivity
no
one
contemplates
commercial
aloofness
nor
any
other
aloofness
contradictory
to
the
best
american
traditions
or
loftiest
human
purposes
our
fortunate
capac
ity
for
comparative
selfcontainment
affords
the
firm
foundation
on
which
to
build
for
our
own
security
and
a
like
foundation
on
which
to
build
for
a
future
of
influence
and
importance
in
world
commerce
our
trade
expansion
must
come
of
capacity
and
of
policies
of
righteousness
and
reasonableness
in
till
our
commercial
relations
let
no
one
assume
that
our
provision
for
maintained
good
fortune
at
home
and
our
unwillingness
to
assume
the
correction
of
all
the
ills
of
the
world
means

in

war
made

we
did
not

an
excess

of
the
worlds
gold
and
we
have
neither
desire
to
profit
unduly
by
its
possession
nor
permanently
retain
it
we
do
not
seek
to
become
an
international
dictator
because
of
its
power
the
voice
of
the

states
has
a
respectful
hearing
in
international
councils
because
we
have
convinced
the
world
that
we
have
no
selfish
ends
to
serve
no
old
grievances
to
avenge
no
territorial
or
other
greed
to
satisfy
but
the
voice

heard
is
that
of
good
counsel
not
of
dictation
it
is
the
voice
of
sympathy
and
fraternity
and
helpfulness
seeking
to

but
not

for

burdens
which
nations
must

we
would
rejoice
to

and
facilitate

which
does
not
drag
us
to
the
very
levels
of
those
we
seek
to
lift
up
while
i
have
everlasting
faith
in
our
republic
it
would
be
folly
indeed
to
blind
ourselves
to
our
problems
at
home
abusing
the
hospitality
of
our
shores
are
the
advocates
of
revolution
finding
their
deluded
followers
among
those
who
take
on
the
habiliments
of
an
american
without
knowing
an
american
soul
there
is
the
recrudescence
of
hyphenated
americanism
which
we
thought
to
have
been
stamped
out
when
we
committed
the
nation
life
and
soul
to
the
world
war
there
is
a
call
to
make
the
alien
respect
our
institutions
while
he
accepts
our
hospitality
there
is
need
to
magnify
the
american
viewpoint
to
the
alien
who
seeks
a
citizenship
among
us
there
is
need
to
magnify
the
national
viewpoint
to
americans
throughout
the
land
more
there
is
a
demand
for
every
living
being
in
the
united
states
to
respect
and
abide
by
the
laws
of
the
republic
let
men
who
are
rending
the
moral
fiber
of
the
republic
through
easy
contempt
for
the
prohibition
law
because
they
think
it
restricts
their
personal
liberty
remember
that
they
set
the
example
and
breed
a
contempt
for
law
which
will
ultimately
destroy
the
republic
constitutional
prohibition
has
been
adopted
by
the
nation
it
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
in
plain
speaking
there
are
conditions
relating
to
its
enforcement
which
savor
of
nationwide
scandal
it
is
the
most
demoralizing
factor
in
our
public
life
most
of
our
people
assumed
that
the
adoption
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
meant
the
elimination
of
the
question
from
our
politics
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
so
intensified
as
an
issue
that
many
voters
are
disposed
to
make
all
political
decisions
with
reference
to
this
single
question
it
is
distracting
the
public
mind
and
prejudicing
the
judgment
of
the
electorate
the
day
is
unlikely
to
come
when
the
eighteenth
amendment
will
be
repealed
the
fact
may
as
well
be
recognized
and
our
course
adapted
accordingly
if
the
statutory
provisions
for
its
enforcement
are
contrary
to
deliberate
public
opinion
which
i
do
not
believe
the
rigorous
and
literal
enforcement
will
concentrate
public
attention
on
any
requisite
modification
such
a
course
conforms
with
the
law
and
saves
the
humiliation
of
the
government
and
the
humiliation
of
our
people
before
the
world
and
challenges
the
destructive
forces
engaged
in
widespread
violation
official
corruption
and
individual
demoralization
the
eighteenth
amendment
involves
the
concurrent
authority
of
state
and
federal
governments
for
the
enforcement
of
the
policy
it
defines
a
certain
lack
of
definiteness
through
division
of
responsibility
is
thus
introduced
in
order
to
bring
about
a
full
understanding
of
duties
and
responsibilities
as
thus
distributed
i
purpose
to
invite
the
governors
of
the
states
and
territories
at
an
early
opportunity
to
a
conference
with
the
federal
executive
authority
out
of
the
full
and
free
considerations
which
will
thus
be
possible
it
is
confidently
believed
will
emerge
a
more
adequate
comprehension
of
the
whole
problem
and
definite
policies
of
national
and
state
cooperation
in
administering
the
laws
there
are
pending
bills
for
the
registration
of
the
alien
who
has
come
to
our
shores
i
wish
the
passage
of
such
an
act
might
be
expedited
life
amid
american
opportunities
is
worth
the
cost
of
registration
if
it
is
worth
the
seeking
and
the
nation
has
the
right
to
know
who
are
citizens
in
the
making
or
who
live
among
us
anti
share
our
advantages
while
seeking
to
undermine
our
cherished
institutions
this
provision
will
enable
us
to
guard
against
the
abuses
in
immigration
checking
the
undesirable
whose
irregular
willing
is
his
first
violation
of
our
laws
more
it
will
facilitate
the
needed
americanizing
of
those
who
mean
to
enroll
as
fellow
citizens
before
enlarging
the
immigration
quotas
we
had
better
provide
registration
for
aliens
those
now
here
or
continually
pressing
for
admission
and
establish
our
examination
boards
abroad
to
make
sure
of
desirables
only
by
the
examination
abroad
we
could
end
the
pathos
at
our
ports
when
men
and
women
find
our
doors
closed
after
long
voyages
and
wasted
savings
because
they
are
unfit
for
admission
it
would
be
kindlier
and
safer
to
tell
them
before
they
embark
our
program
of
admission
and
treatment
of
immigrants
is
very
intimately
related
to
the
educational
policy
of
the
republic
with
illiteracy
estimated
at
front
twotenths
of
per
cent
to
less
than
per
cent
in
of
the
foremost
nations
of
europe
it
rivets
our
attention
to
it
serious
problem
when
we
are
reminded
of
a
per
cent
illiteracy
in
the
united
states
the
figures
are
based
on
the
test
which
defines
an
illiterate
as
one
having
no
schooling
whatever
remembering
the
wide
freedom
of
our
public
schools
with
compulsory
attendance
in
many
states
in
the
union
one
is
convinced
that
much
of
our
excessive
illiteracy
comes
to
us
from
abroad
and
the
education
of
the
immigrant
becomes
it
requisite
to
his
americanization
it
must
be
done
if
he
is
fittingly
to
exercise
the
duties
as
well
as
enjoy
the
privileges
of
american
citizenship
here
is
revealed
the
special
field
for
federal
cooperation
in
furthering
education
from
the
very
beginning
public
education
has
been
left
mainly
in
the
hands
of
the
states
so
far
as
schooling
youth
is
concerned
the
policy
has
been
justified
because
no
responsibility
can
be
so
effective
as
that
of
the
local
community
alive
to
its
task
i
believe
in
the
cooperation
of
the
national
authority
to
stimulate
encourage
and
broaden
the
work
of
the
local
authorities
but
it
is
the
especial
obligation
of
the
federal
government
to
devise
means
and
effectively
assist
in
the
education
of
the
newcomer
from
foreign
lands
so
that
the
level
of
american
education
may
be
made
the
highest
that
is
humanly
possible
closely
related
to
this
problem
of
education
is
the
abolition
of
child
labor
twice
congress
has
attempted
the
correction
of
the
evils
incident
to
child
employment
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
has
put
this
problem
outside
the
proper
domain
of
federal
regulation
until
the
constitution
is
so
amended
as
to
give
the
congress
indubitable
authority
i
recommend
the
submission
of
such
an
amendment
we
have
two
schools
of
thought
relating
to
amendment
of
the
constitution
one
need
not
be
committed
to
the
belief
that
amendment
is
weakening
the
fundamental
law
or
that
excessive
amendment
is
essential
to
meet
every
ephemeral
whim
we
ought
to
amend
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
people
when
sanctioned
by
deliberate
public
opinion
one
year
ago
i
suggested
the
submission
of
an
amendment
so
that
we
may
lawfully
restrict
the
issues
of
taxexempt
securities
and
i
renew
that
recommendation
now
taxexempt
securities
are
drying
up
the
sources
of
federal
taxation
and
they
are
encouraging
unproductive
and
extravagant
expenditures
by
states
and
municipalities
there
is
more
than
the
menace
in
mounting
public
debt
there
is
the
dissipation
of
capital
which
should
be
made
available
to
the
needs
of
productive
industry
the
proposed
amendment
will
place
the
state
and
federal
governments
and
all
political
subdivisions
on
an
exact
equality
and
will
correct
the
growing
menace
of
public
borrowing
which
if
left
unchecked
may
soon
threaten
the
stability
of
our
institutions
we
are
so
vast
and
so
varied
in
our
national
interests
that
scores
of
problems
are
pressing
for
attention
i
must
not
risk
the
wearying
of
your
patience
with
detailed
reference
reclamation
and
irrigation
projects
where
waste
land
may
be
made
available
for
settlement
and
productivity
are
worthy
of
your
favorable
consideration
when
it
is
realized
that
we
are
consuming
our
timber
four
times
as
rapidly
as
we
are
growing
it
we
must
encourage
the
greatest
possible
cooperation
between
the
federal
government
the
various
states
and
the
owners
of
forest
lands
to
the
end
that
protection
from
fire
shall
be
made
more
effective
and
replanting
encouraged
the
fuel
problem
is
under
study
now
by
a
very
capable
factfinding
commission
and
any
attempt
to
deal
with
the
coal
problem
of
such
deep
concern
to
the
entire
nation
must
await
the
report
of
the
commission
there
are
necessary
studies
of
great
problems
which
congress
might
well
initiate
the
wide
spread
between
production
costs
and
prices
which
consumers
pay
concerns
every
citizen
of
the
republic
it
contributes
very
largely
to
the
unrest
in
agriculture
and
must
stand
sponsor
for
much
against
which
we
inveigh
in
that
familiar
termthe
high
cost
of
living
no
one
doubts
the
excess
is
traceable
to
the
levy
of
the
middleman
but
it
would
be
unfair
to
charge
him
with
all
responsibility
before
we
appraise
what
is
exacted
of
him
by
our
modernly
complex
life
we
ha
ve
attacked
the
problem
on
one
side
by
the
promotion
of
cooperative
marketing
and
we
might
well
inquire
into
the
benefits
of
cooperative
buying
admittedly
the
consumer
is
much
to
blame
himself
because
of
his
prodigal
expenditure
and
his
exaction
of
service
but
government
might
well
serve
to
point
the
way
of
narrowing
the
spread
of
price
especially
between
the
production
of
food
and
its
consumption
a
superpower
survey
of
the
eastern
industrial
region
has
recently
been
completed
looking
to
unification
of
steam
water
and
electric
powers
and
to
a
unified
scheme
of
power
distribution
the
survey
proved
that
vast
economies
in
tonnage
movement
of
freights
and
in
the
efficiency
of
the
railroads
would
be
effected
if
the
superpower
program
were
adopted
i
am
convinced
that
constructive
measures
calculated
to
promote
such
an
industrial
developmenti
am
tempted
to
say
such
an
industrial
revolutionwould
be
well
worthy
the
careful
attention
and
fostering
interest
of
the
national
government
the
proposed
survey
of
a
plan
to
draft
all
the
resources
of
the
republic
human
and
material
for
national
defense
may
well
have
your
approval
i
commended
such
a
program
in
case
of
future
war
in
the
inaugural
address
of
march
and
every
experience
in
the
adjustment
and
liquidation
of
war
claims
and
the
settlement
of
war
obligations
persuades
me
we
ought
to
be
prepared
for
such
universal
call
to
armed
defense
i
bring
you
no
apprehension
of
war
the
world
is
abhorrent
of
it
and
our
own
relations
are
not
only
free
from
every
threatening
cloud
but
we
have
contributed
our
larger
influence
toward
making
armed
conflict
less
likely
those
who
assume
that
we
played
our
part
in
the
world
war
and
later
took
ourselves
aloof
and
apart
unmindful
of
world
obligations
give
scant
credit
to
the
helpful
part
we
assume
in
international
relationships
whether
all
nations
signatory
ratify
all
the
treaties
growing
out
of
the
washington
conference
on
limitation
of
armament
or
some
withhold
approval
the
underlying
policy
of
limiting
naval
armament
has
the
sanction
of
the
larger
naval
powers
and
naval
competition
is
suspended
of
course
unanimous
ratification
is
much
to
be
desired
the
fourpower
pact
which
abolishes
every
probability
of
war
on
the
pacific
has
brought
new
confidence
in
a
maintained
peace
and
i
can
well
believe
it
might
be
made
a
model
for
like
assurances
wherever
in
the
world
any
common
interests
are
concerned
we
have
had
expressed
the
hostility
of
the
american
people
to
a
supergovernment
or
to
any
commitment
where
either
a
council
or
an
assembly
of
leagued
powers
may
chart
our
course
treaties
of
armed
alliance
can
have
no
likelihood
of
american
sanction
but
we
believe
in
respecting
the
rights
of
nations
in
the
value
of
conference
and
consultation
in
the
effectiveness
of
leaders
of
nations
looking
each
other
in
the
face
ace
before
resorting
to
the
arbitrament
of
arms
it
has
been
our
fortune
both
to
preach
and
promote
international
understanding
the
influence
of
the
united
states
in
bringing
near
the
settlement
of
an
ancient
dispute
between
south
american
nations
is
added
proof
of
the
glow
of
peace
in
ample
understanding
in
washington
today
are
met
the
delegates
of
the
central
american
nations
gathered
at
the
table
of
international
understanding
to
stabilize
their
republics
and
remove
every
vestige
of
disagreement
they
are
met
here
by
our
invitation
not
in
our
aloofness
and
they
accept
our
hospitality
because
they
have
faith
in
our
unselfishness
and
believe
in
our
helpfulness
perhaps
we
are
selfish
in
craving
their
confidence
and
friendship
but
such
a
selfishness
we
proclaim
to
the
world
regardless
of
hemisphere
or
seas
dividing
i
would
like
the
congress
and
the
people
of
the
nation
to
believe
that
in
a
firm
and
considerate
way
we
are
insistent
on
american
rights
wherever
they
may
be
questioned
and
deny
no
rights
of
others
in
the
assertion
of
our
own
moreover
we
are
cognizant
of
the
worlds
struggles
for
full
readjustment
and
rehabilitation
and
we
have
shirked
no
duty
which
comes
of
sympathy
or
fraternity
or
highest
fellowship
among
nations
every
obligation
consonant
with
american
ideals
and
sanctioned
under
our
form
of
government
is
willingly
met
when
we
can
not
support
we
do
not
demand
our
constitutional
limitations
do
not
forbid
the
exercise
of
a
moral
influence
the
measure
of
which
is
not
less
than
the
high
purposes
we
have
sought
to
serve
after
all
there
is
less
difference
about
the
part
this
great
republic
shall
play
in
furthering
peace
and
advancing
humanity
than
in
the
manner
of
playing
it
we
ask
no
one
to
assume
responsibility
for
us
we
assume
no
responsibility
which
others
must
bear
for
themselves
unless
nationality
is
hopelessly
swallowed
up
in
internationalism

mr
speaker
and
members
of
the
congress
it
is
a
very
gratifying
privilege
to
come
to
the
congress
with
the
republic
at
peace
with
all
the
nations
of
the
world
more
it
is
equally
gratifying
to
report
that
our
country
is
not
only
free
from
every
impending
menace
of
war
but
there
are
growing
assurances
of
the
permanency
of
the
peace
which
we
so
deeply
cherish
for
approximately
ten
years
we
have
dwelt
amid
menaces
of
war
or
as
participants
in
wars
actualities
and
the
inevitable
aftermath
with
its
disordered
conditions
bits
added
to
the
difficulties
of
government
which
adequately
can
not
be
appraised
except
by
those
who
are
in
immediate
contact
and
know
the
responsibilities
our
tasks
would
be
less
difficult
if
we
had
only
ourselves
to
consider
but
so
much
of
the
world
was
involved
the
disordered
conditions
are
so
wellnigh
universal
even
among
nations
not
engaged
in
actual
warfare
that
no
permanent
readjustments
can
be
effected
without
consideration
of
our
inescapable
relationship
to
world
affairs
in
finance
and
trade
indeed
we
should
be
unworthy
of
our
best
traditions
if
we
were
unmindful
of
social
moral
and
political
conditions
which
are
not
of
direct
concern
to
us
but
which
do
appeal
to
the
human
sympathies
and
the
very
becoming
interest
of
a
people
blest
with
our
national
good
fortune
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
bring
to
you
a
program
of
world
restoration
in
the
main
such
a
program
must
be
worked
out
by
the
nations
more
directly
concerned
they
must
themselves
turn
to
the
heroic
remedies
for
the
menacing
conditions
under
which
they
are
struggling
then
we
can
help
and
we
mean
to
help
we
shall
do
so
unselfishly
because
there
is
compensation
in
the
consciousness
of
assisting
selfishly
because
the
commerce
and
international
exchanges
in
trade
which
marked
our
high
tide
of
fortunate
advancement
are
possible
only
when
the
nations
of
all
continents
are
restored
to
stable
order
and
normal
relationship
in
the
main
the
contribution
of
this
republic
to
restored
normalcy
in
the
world
must
come
through
the
initiative
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
but
the
best
of
intentions
and
most
carefully
considered
purposes
would
fail
utterly
if
the
sanction
and
the
cooperation
of
congress
were
not
cheerfully
accorded
i
am
very
sure
we
shall
have
no
conflict
of
opinion
about
constitutional
duties
or
authority
during
the
anxieties
of
war
when
necessity
seemed
compelling
there
were
excessive
grants
of
authority
and
all
extraordinary
concentration
of
powers
in
the
chief
executive
the
repeal
of
wartime
legislation
and
the
automatic
expirations
which
attended
the
peace
proclamations
have
put
an
end
to
these
emergency
excesses
but
i
have
the
wish
to
go
further
than
that
i
want
to
join
you
ill
restoring
ill
the
most
cordial
way
the
spirit
of
coordination
and
cooperation
and
that
mutuality
of
confidence
and
respect
which
is
necessary
ill
representative
popular
government
encroachment
upon
the
functions
of
congress
or
attempted
dictation
of
its
policy
are
not
to
be
thought
of
much
less
attempted
but
there
is
all
insistent
call
for
harmony
of
purpose
and
concord
of
action
to
speed
the
solution
of
the
difficult
problems
confronting
both
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
the
government
it
is
worth
while
to
make
allusion
here
to
the
character
of
our
clove
government
mindful
as
one
must
be
that
an
address
to
you
is
no
less
it
message
to
all
our
people
for
whom
you
speak
most
intimately
ours
is
it
popular
government
through
political
parties
we
divide
along
political
lines
and
i
would
ever
have
it
so
i
do
not
mean
that
partisan
preferences
should
hinder
any
public
servant
in
the
performance
of
a
conscientious
and
patriotic
official
duty
we
saw
partisan
lines
utterly
obliterated
when
war
imperiled
and
our
faith
in
the
republic
was
riveted
anew
we
ought
not
to
find
these
partisan
lines
obstructing
the
expeditious
solution
of
the
urgent
problems
of
peace
granting
that
we
are
fundamentally
a
representative
popular
government
with
political
parties
the
governing
agencies
i
believe
the
political
party
in
power
should
assume
responsibility
determine
upon
policies
ill
the
conference
which
supplements
conventions
and
election
campaigns
and
then
strive
for
achievement
through
adherence
to
the
accepted
policy
there
is
vastly
greater
security
immensely
more
of
the
national
viewpoint
much
larger
and
prompter
accomplishment
where
our
divisions
are
along
party
lines
in
the
broader
and
loftier
sense
than
to
divide
geographically
or
according
to
pursuits
or
personal
following
for
a
century
and
a
third
parties
have
been
charged
with
responsibility
and
held
to
strict
accounting
when
they
fail
they
are
relieved
of
authority
and
the
system
has
brought
its
to
a
national
eminence
no
less
than
a
world
example
necessarily
legislation
is
a
matter
of
compromise
the
full
ideal
is
seldom
attained
in
that
meeting
of
minds
necessary
to
insure
results
there
must
and
will
be
accommodations
and
compromises
but
in
the
estimate
of
convictions
and
sincere
putposes
the
supreme
responsibility
to
national
interest
must
not
be
ignored
the
shield
to
the
highminded
public
servant
who
adheres
to
party
policy
is
manifest
but
the
higher
purpose
is
the
good
of
the
republic
as
a
whole
it
would
be
ungracious
to
withhold
acknowledgment
of
the
really
large
volume
and
excellent
quality
of
work
accomplished
by
the
extraordinary
session
of
congress
which
so
recently
adjourned
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
very
difficult
tasks
with
which
you
were
called
to
deal
and
no
one
can
ignore
the
insistent
conditions
which
during
recent
years
have
called
for
the
continued
and
almost
exclusive
attention
of
your
membership
to
public
work
it
would
suggest
insincerity
if
i
expressed
complete
accord
with
every
expression
recorded
in
your
roll
calls
but
we
are
all
agreed
about
the
difficulties
and
the
inevitable
divergence
of
opinion
in
seeking
the
reduction
amelioration
and
readjustment
of
the
burdens
of
taxation
later
on
when
other
problems
are
solved
i
shall
make
some
recommendations
about
renewed
consideration
of
our
tax
program
but
for
the
immediate
time
before
us
we
must
be
content
with
the
billion
dollar
reduction
in
the
tax
draft
upon
the
people
and
diminished
irritations
banished
uncertainty
and
improved
methods
of
collection
by
your
sustainment
of
the
rigid
economies
already
inaugurated
with
hopedfor
extension
of
these
economies
and
added
efficiencies
in
administration
i
believe
further
reductions
may
be
enacted
and
hindering
burdens
abolished
in
these
urgent
economies
we
shall
be
immensely
assisted
by
the
budget
system
for
which
you
made
provision
in
the
extraordinary
session
the
first
budget
is
before
you
its
preparation
is
a
signal
achievement
and
the
perfection
of
the
system
a
thing
impossible
in
the
few
months
available
for
its
initial
trial
will
mark
its
enactment
as
the
beginning
of
the
greatest
reformation
in
governmental
practices
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic
there
is
pending
a
grant
of
authority
to
the
administrative
branch
of
the
government
for
the
funding
and
settlement
of
our
vast
foreign
loans
growing
out
of
our
grant
of
war
credits
with
the
hands
of
the
executive
branch
held
impotent
to
deal
with
these
debts
we
are
hindering
urgent
readjustments
among
our
debtors
and
accomplishing
nothing
for
ourselves
i
think
it
is
fair
for
the
congress
to
assume
that
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
would
adopt
no
major
policy
in
dealing
with
these
matters
which
would
conflict
with
the
purpose
of
congress
in
authorizing
the
loans
certainly
not
without
asking
congressional
approval
but
there
are
minor
problems
incident
to
prudent
loan
transactions
and
the
safeguarding
of
our
interests
which
can
not
even
be
attempted
without
this
authorization
it
will
be
helpful
to
ourselves
and
it
will
improve
conditions
among
our
debtors
if
funding
and
the
settlement
of
defaulted
interest
may
be
negotiated
the
previous
congress
deeply
concerned
in
behalf
of
our
merchant
marine
in
enacted
the
existing
shipping
law
designed
for
the
upbuilding
of
the
american
merchant
marine
among
other
things
provided
to
encourage
our
shipping
on
the
worlds
seas
the
executive
was
directed
to
give
notice
of
the
termination
of
all
existing
commercial
treaties
in
order
to
admit
of
reduced
duties
on
imports
carried
in
american
bottoms
during
the
life
of
the
act
no
executive
has
complied
with
this
order
of
the
congress
when
the
present
administration
came
into
responsibility
it
began
an
early
inquiry
into
the
failure
to
execute
the
expressed
purpose
of
the
jones
act
only
one
conclusion
has
been
possible
frankly
members
of
house
and
senate
eager
its
i
am
to
join
you
in
the
making
of
an
american
merchant
marine
commensurate
with
our
commerce
the
denouncement
of
our
commercial
treaties
would
involve
us
in
a
chaos
of
trade
relationships
and
add
indescribably
to
the
confusion
of
the
already
disordered
commercial
world
our
power
to
do
so
is
not
disputed
but
power
and
ships
without
comity
of
relationship
will
not
give
us
the
expanded
trade
which
is
inseparably
linked
with
a
great
merchant
marine
moreover
the
applied
reduction
of
duty
for
which
the
treaty
denouncements
were
necessary
encouraged
only
the
carrying
of
dutiable
imports
to
our
shores
while
the
tonnage
which
unfurls
the
flag
on
the
seas
is
both
free
and
dutiable
and
the
cargoes
which
make
it
nation
eminent
in
trade
are
outgoing
rather
than
incoming
it
is
not
my
thought
to
lay
the
problem
before
you
in
detail
today
it
is
desired
only
to
say
to
you
that
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
uninfluenced
by
the
protest
of
any
nation
for
none
has
been
made
is
well
convinced
that
your
proposal
highly
intended
and
heartily
supported
here
is
so
fraught
with
difficulties
and
so
marked
by
tendencies
to
discourage
trade
expansion
that
i
invite
your
tolerance
of
noncompliance
for
only
a
few
weeks
until
a
plan
may
be
presented
which
contemplates
no
greater
draft
upon
the
public
treasury
and
which
though
yet
too
crude
to
offer
it
today
gives
such
promise
of
expanding
our
merchant
marine

that
it
will
argue
its
own
approval
it
is
enough
to
say
today
that
we
are
so
possessed
of
ships
and
the
american
intention
to
establish
it
merchant
marine
is
so
unalterable
that
a
plain
of
reimbursement
at
no
other
cost
than
is
contemplated
in
the
existing
act
will
appeal
to
the
pride
and
encourage
the
hope
of
all
the
american
people
there
is
before
you
the
completion
of
the
enactment
of
what
has
been
termed
a
permanent
tariff
law
the
word
permanent
being
used
to
distinguish
it
from
the
emergency
act
which
the
congress
expedited
early
in
the
extraordinary
session
and
which
is
the
law
today
i
can
not
too
strongly
urge
in
early
completion
of
this
necessary
legislation
it
is
needed
to
stabilize
our
industry
at
home
it
is
essential
to
make
more
definite
our
trade
relations
abroad
more
it
is
vital
to
the
preservation
of
many
of
our
own
industries
which
contribute
so
notably
to
the
very
lifeblood
of
our
nation
there
is
now
and
there
always
will
be
a
storm
of
conflicting
opinion
about
any
tariff
revision
we
can
not
go
far
wrong
when
we
base
our
tariffs
on
the
policy
of
preserving
the
productive
activities
which
enhance
employment
and
add
to
our
national
prosperity
again
comes
the
reminder
that
we
must
not
be
unmindful
of
world
conditions
that
peoples
are
struggling
for
industrial
rehabilitation
and
that
we
can
not
dwell
in
industrial
and
commercial
exclusion
and
at
the
same
time
do
the
just
thing
in
aiding
world
reconstruction
and
readjustment
we
do
not
seek
a
selfish
aloofness
and
we
could
not
profit
by
it
were
it
possible
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
buying
wherever
we
sell
and
the
permanency
of
trade
lies
in
its
acceptable
exchanges
in
our
pursuit
of
markets
we
must
give
as
well
as
receive
we
can
not
sell
to
others
who
do
not
produce
nor
can
we
buy
unless
we
produce
at
home
sensible
of
every
obligation
of
humanity
commerce
and
finance
linked
as
they
are
in
the
present
world
condition
it
is
not
to
be
argued
that
we
need
destroy
ourselves
to
be
helpful
to
others
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
restoration
to
the
peoples
blighted
by
the
awful
world
war
but
the
process
of
restoration
does
not
lie
in
our
acceptance
of
like
conditions
it
were
better
to
remain
on
firm
ground
strive
for
ample
employment
and
high
standards
of
wage
at
home
and
point
the
way
to
balanced
budgets
rigid
economies
and
resolute
efficient
work
as
the
necessary
remedies
to
cure
disaster
everything
relating
to
trade
among
ourselves
and
among
nations
has
been
expanded
excessive
inflated
abnormal
and
there
is
a
madness
in
finance
which
no
american
policy
alone
will
cure
we
are
a
creditor
nation
not
by
normal
processes
but
made
so
by
war
it
is
not
an
unworthy
selfishness
to
seek
to
save
ourselves
when
the
processes
of
that
salvation
are
not
only
not
denied
to
others
but
commended
to
them
we
seek
to
undermine
for
others
no
industry
by
which
they
subsist
we
are
obligated
to
permit
the
undermining
of
none
of
our
own
which
make
for
employment
and
maintained
activities
every
contemplation
it
little
matters
in
which
direction
one
turns
magnifies
the
difficulty
of
tariff
legislation
but
the
necessity
of
the
revision
is
magnified
with
it
doubtless
we
are
justified
in
seeking
it
more
flexible
policy
than
we
have
provided
heretofore
i
hope
a
way
will
be
found
to
make
for
flexibility
and
elasticity
so
that
rates
may
be
adjusted
to
meet
unusual
and
changing
conditions
which
can
not
be
accurately
anticipated
there
are
problems
incident
to
unfair
practices
and
to
exchanges
which
madness
in
money
have
made
almost
unsolvable
i
know
of
no
manner
in
which
to
effect
this
flexibility
other
than
the
extension
of
the
powers
of
the
tariff
commission
so
that
it
can
adapt
itself
to
it
scientific
and
wholly
just
administration
of
the
law
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
constitutional
difficulties
these
can
be
met
by
giving
authority
to
the
chief
executive
who
could
proclaimadditional
duties
to
meet
conditions
which
the
congress
may
designate
at
this
point
i
must
disavow
any
desire
to
enlarge
the
executives
powers
or
add
to
the
responsibilities
of
the
office
they
are
already
too
large
if
there
were
any
other
plan
i
would
prefer
it
the
grant
of
authority
to
proclaim
would
necessarily
bring
the
tariff
commission
into
new
and
enlarged
activities
because
no
executive
could
discharge
such
a
duty
except
upon
the
information
acquired
and
recommendations
made
by
this
commission
but
the
plan
is
feasible
and
the
proper
functioning
of
the
board
would
give
its
it
better
administration
of
a
defined
policy
than
ever
can
be
made
possible
by
tariff
duties
prescribed
without
flexibility
there
is
a
manifest
difference
of
opinion
about
the
merits
of
american
valuation
many
nations
have
adopted
delivery
valuation
as
the
basis
for
collecting
duties
that
is
they
take
the
cost
of
the
imports
delivered
at
the
port
of
entry
as
the
basis
for
levying
duty
it
is
no
radical
departure
in
view
of
varying
conditions
and
the
disordered
state
of
money
values
to
provide
for
american
valuation
but
there
can
not
be
ignored
the
danger
of
such
a
valuation
brought
to
the
level
of
our
own
production
costs
making
our
tariffs
prohibitive
it
might
do
so
in
many
instances
where
imports
ought
to
be
encouraged
i
believe
congress
ought
well
consider
the
desirability
of
the
only
promising
alternative
namely
a
provision
authorizing
proclaimed
american
valuation
under
prescribed
conditions
on
any
given
list
of
articles
imported
in
this
proposed
flexibility
authorizing
increases
to
meet
conditions
so
likely
to
change
there
should
also
be
provision
for
decreases
a
rate
may
be
just
today
and
entirely
out
of
proportion
six
months
from
today
if
our
tariffs
are
to
be
made
equitable
and
not
necessarily
burden
our
imports
and
hinder
our
trade
abroad
frequent
adjustment
will
be
necessary
for
years
to
come
knowing
the
impossibility
of
modification
by
act
of
congress
for
any
one
or
a
score
of
lines
without
involving
a
long
array
of
schedules
i
think
we
shall
go
a
long
ways
toward
stabilization
if
there
is
recognition
of
the
tariff
commissions
fitness
to
recommend
urgent
changes
by
proclamation
i
am
sure
about
public
opinion
favoring
the
early
determination
of
our
tariff
policy
there
have
been
reassuring
signs
of
a
business
revival
from
the
deep
slump
which
all
the
world
has
been
experiencing
our
unemployment
which
gave
its
deep
concern
only
a
few
weeks
ago
has
grown
encouragingly
less
and
new
assurances
and
renewed
confidence
will
attend
the
congressional
declaration
that
american
industry
will
be
held
secure
much
has
been
said
about
the
protective
policy
for
ourselves
making
it
impossible
for
our
debtors
to
discharge
their
obligations
to
us
this
is
a
contention
not
now
pressing
for
decision
if
we
must
choose
between
a
people
in
idleness
pressing
for
the
payment
of
indebtedness
or
a
people
resuming
the
normal
ways
of
employment
and
carrying
the
credit
let
us
choose
the
latter
sometimes
we
appraise
largest
the
human
ill
most
vivid
in
our
minds
we
have
been
giving
and
are
giving
now
of
our
influence
and
appeals
to
minimize
the
likelihood
of
war
and
throw
off
the
crushing
burdens
of
armament
it
is
all
very
earnest
with
a
national
soul
impelling
but
a
people
unemployed
and
gaunt
with
hunger
face
a
situation
quite
as
disheartening
as
war
and
our
greater
obligation
today
is
to
do
the
governments
part
toward
resuming
productivity
and
promoting
fortunate
and
remunerative
employment
something
more
than
tariff
protection
is
required
by
american
agriculture
to
the
farmer
has
come
the
earlier
and
the
heavier
burdens
of
readjustment
there
is
actual
depression
in
our
agricultural
industry
while
agricultural
prosperity
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
general
prosperity
of
the
country
congress
has
sought
very
earnestly
to
provide
relief
it
has
promptly
given
such
temporary
relief
as
has
been
possible
but
the
call
is
insistent
for
the
permanent
solution
it
is
inevitable
that
large
crops
lower
the
prices
and
short
crops
advance
them
no
legislation
can
cure
that
fundamental
law
but
there
must
be
some
economic
solution
for
the
excessive
variation
in
returns
for
agricultural
production
it
is
rather
shocking
to
be
told
and
to
have
the
statement
strongly
supported
that
bales
of
cotton
raised
on
american
plantations
in
a
given
year
will
actually
be
worth
more
to
the
producers
than
bales
would
have
been
equally
shocking
is
the
statement
that
bushels
of
wheat
raised
by
american
farmers
would
bring
them
more
money
than
a
billion
bushels
yet
these
are
not
exaggerated
statements
in
a
world
where
there
are
tens
of
millions
who
need
food
and
clothing
which
they
can
not
get
such
a
condition
is
sure
to
indict
the
social
system
which
makes
it
possible
in
the
main
the
remedy
lies
in
distribution
and
marketing
every
proper
encouragement
should
be
given
to
the
cooperative
marketing
programs
these
have
proven
very
helpful
to
the
cooperating
communities
in
europe
in
russia
the
cooperative
community
has
become
the
recognized
bulwark
of
law
and
order
and
saved
individualism
from
engulfment
in
social
paralysis
ultimately
they
will
be
accredited
with
the
salvation
of
the
russian
state
there
is
the
appeal
for
this
experiment
why
not
try
it
no
one
challenges
the
right
of
the
farmer
to
a
larger
share
of
the
consumers
pay
for
his
product
no
one
disputes
that
we
can
not
live
without
the
farmer
he
is
justified
in
rebelling
against
the
transportation
cost
given
a
fair
return
for
his
labor
he
will
have
less
occasion
to
appeal
for
financial
aid
and
given
assurance
that
his
labors
shall
not
be
in
vain
we
reassure
all
the
people
of
a
production
sufficient
to
meet
our
national
requirement
and
guard
against
disaster
the
base
of
the
pyramid
of
civilization
which
rests
upon
the
soil
is
shrinking
through
the
drift
of
population
from
farm
to
city
for
a
generation
we
have
been
expressing
more
or
less
concern
about
this
tendency
economists
have
warned
and
statesmen
have
deplored
we
thought
for
at
time
that
modern
conveniences
and
the
more
intimate
contact
would
halt
the
movement
but
it
has
gone
steadily
on
per
haps
only
grim
necessity
will
correct
it
but
we
ought
to
find
a
less
drastic
remedy
the
existing
scheme
of
adjusting
freight
rates
hits
been
favoring
the
basing
points
until
industries
are
attracted
to
some
centers
and
repelled
from
others
a
great
volume
of
uneconomic
and
wasteful
transportation
has
attended
and
the
cost
increased
accordingly
the
grainmilling
and
meatpacking
industries
afford
ample
illustration
and
the
attending
concentration
is
readily
apparent
the
menaces
in
concentration
are
not
limited
to
the
retardingly
influences
on
agriculture
manifestly
the
conditions
and
terms
of
railway
transportation
ought
not
be
permitted
to
increase
this
undesirable
tendency
we
have
a
just
pride
in
our
great
cities
but
we
shall
find
a
greater
pride
in
the
nation
which
has
it
larger
distribution
of
its
population
into
the
country
where
comparatively
selfsufficient
smaller
communities
may
blend
agricultural
and
manufacturing
interests
in
harmonious
helpfulness
and
enhanced
good
fortune
such
a
movement
contemplates
no
destruction
of
things
wrought
of
investments
made
or
wealth
involved
it
only
looks
to
a
general
policy
of
transportation
of
distributed
industry
and
of
highway
construction
to
encourage
the
spread
of
our
population
and
restore
the
proper
balance
between
city
and
country
the
problem
may
well
have
your
earnest
attention
it
has
been
perhaps
the
proudest
claim
of
our
american
civilization
that
in
dealing
with
human
relationships
it
has
constantly
moved
toward
such
justice
in
distributing
the
product
of
human
energy
that
it
has
improved
continuously
the
economic
status
of
the
mass
of
people
ours
has
been
a
highly
productive
social
organization
on
the
way
up
from
the
elemental
stages
of
society
we
have
eliminated
slavery
and
serfdom
and
are
now
far
on
the
way
to
the
elimination
of
poverty
through
the
eradication
of
illiteracy
and
the
diffusion
of
education
mankind
has
reached
a
stage
where
we
may
fairly
say
that
in
the
united
states
equality
of
opportunity
has
been
attained
though
all
are
not
prepared
to
embrace
it
there
is
indeed
a
too
great
divergence
between
the
economic
conditions
of
the
most
and
the
least
favored
classes
in
the
community
but
even
that
divergence
has
now
come
to
the
point
where
we
bracket
the
very
poor
and
the
very
rich
together
as
the
least
fortunate
classes
our
efforts
may
well
be
directed
to
improving
the
status
of
both
while
this
set
of
problems
is
commonly
comprehended
under
the
general
phrase
capital
and
labor
it
is
really
vastly
broader
it
is
a
question
of
social
and
economic
organization
labor
has
become
a
large
contributor
through
its
savings
to
the
stock
of
capital
while
the
people
who
own
the
largest
individual
aggregates
of
capital
are
themselves
often
hard
and
earnest
laborers
very
often
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
draw
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
two
groups
to
determine
whether
a
particular
individual
is
entitled
to
be
set
down
as
laborer
or
as
capitalist
in
a
very
large
proportion
of
cases
he
is
both
and
when
he
is
both
he
is
the
most
useful
citizen
the
right
of
labor
to
organize
is
just
as
fundamental
and
necessary
as
is
the
right
of
capital
to
organize
the
right
of
labor
to
negotiate
to
deal
with
and
solve
its
particular
problems
in
an
organized
way
through
its
chosen
agents
is
just
as
essential
as
is
the
right
of
capital
to
organize
to
maintain
corporations
to
limit
the
liabilities
of
stockholders
indeed
we
have
come
to
recognize
that
the
limited
liability
of
the
citizen
as
a
member
of
a
labor
organization
closely
parallels
the
limitation
of
liability
of
the
citizen
as
a
stockholder
in
a
corporation
for
profit
along
this
line
of
reasoning
we
shall
make
the
greatest
progress
toward
solution
of
our
problem
of
capital
and
labor
in
the
case
of
the
corporation
which
enjoys
the
privilege
of
limited
liability
of
stockholders
particularly
when
engaged
in
in
the
public
service
it
is
recognized
that
the
outside
public
has
a
large
concern
which
must
be
protected
and
so
we
provide
regulations
restrictions
and
in
some
cases
detailed
supervision
likewise
in
the
case
of
labor
organizations
we
might
well
apply
similar
and
equally
welldefined
principles
of
regulation
and
supervision
in
order
to
conserve
the
publics
interests
as
affected
by
their
operations
just
as
it
is
not
desirable
that
a
corporation
shall
be
allowed
to
impose
undue
exactions
upon
the
public
so
it
is
not
desirable
that
a
labor
organization
shall
be
permitted
to
exact
unfair
terms
of
employment
or
subject
the
public
to
actual
distresses
in
order
to
enforce
its
terms
finally
just
as
we
are
earnestly
seeking
for
procedures
whereby
to
adjust
and
settle
political
differences
between
nations
without
resort
to
war
so
we
may
well
look
about
for
means
to
settle
the
differences
between
organized
capital
and
organized
labor
without
resort
to
those
forms
of
warfare
which
we
recognize
under
the
name
of
strikes
lockouts
boycotts
and
the
like
as
we
have
great
bodies
of
law
carefully
regulating
the
organization
and
operations
of
industrial
and
financial
corporations
as
we
have
treaties
and
compacts
among
nations
which
look
to
the
settlement
of
differences
without
the
necessity
of
conflict
in
arms
so
we
might
well
have
plans
of
conference
of
common
counsel
of
mediation
arbitration
and
judicial
determination
in
controversies
between
labor
and
capital
to
accomplish
this
would
involve
the
necessity
to
develop
a
thoroughgoing
code
of
practice
in
dealing
with
such
affairs
it
might
be
well
to
frankly
set
forth
the
superior
interest
of
the
community
as
a
whole
to
either
the
labor
group
or
the
capital
group
with
rights
privileges
immunities
and
modes
of
organization
thus
carefully
defined
it
should
be
possible
to
set
up
judicial
or
quasi
judicial
tribunals
for
the
consideration
and
determination
of
all
disputes
which
menace
the
public
welfare
in
an
industrial
society
such
as
ours
the
strike
the
lockout
and
the
boycott
are
as
much
out
of
place
and
as
disastrous
in
their
results
as
is
war
or
armed
revolution
in
the
domain
of
politics
the
same
disposition
to
reasonableness
to
conciliation
to
recognition
of
the
other
sides
point
of
view
the
same
provision
of
fair
and
recognized
tribunals
and
processes
ought
to
make
it
possible
to
solve
the
one
set
of
questions
its
easily
as
the
other
i
believe
the
solution
is
possible
the
consideration
of
such
a
policy
would
necessitate
the
exercise
of
care
and
deliberation
in
the
construction
of
a
code
and
a
charter
of
elemental
rights
dealing
with
the
relations
of
employer
and
employee
this
foundation
in
the
law
dealing
with
the
modern
conditions
of
social
and
economic
life
would
hasten
the
building
of
the
temple
of
peace
in
industry
which
a
rejoicing
nation
would
acclaim
after
each
war
until
the
last
the
government
has
been
enabled
to
give
homes
to
its
returned
soldiers
and
a
large
part
of
our
settlement
and
development
has
attended
this
generous
provision
of
land
for
the
nations
defenders
there
is
yet
unreserved
approximately
acres
in
the
public
domain
acres
of
which
are
known
to
be
susceptible
of
reclamation
and
made
fit
for
homes
by
provision
for
irrigation
the
government
has
been
assisting
in
the
development
of
its
remaining
lands
until
the
estimated
increase
in
land
values
in
the
irrigated
sections
is
full
and
the
crops
of
alone
on
these
lands
are
estimated
to
exceed
under
the
law
authorization
these
expenditures
for
development
the
advances
are
to
be
returned
and
it
would
be
good
business
for
the
government
to
provide
for
the
reclamation
of
the
remaining
acres
in
addition
to
expediting
the
completion
of
projects
long
under
way
under
what
is
known
as
the
coal
and
gas
lease
law
applicable
also
to
deposits
of
phosphates
and
other
minerals
on
the
public
domain
leases
are
now
being
made
on
the
royalty
basis
and
are
producing
large
revenues
to
the
government
under
this
legislation
per
centum
of
all
royalties
is
to
be
paid
directly
to
the
federal
treasury
and
of
the
remainder
per
centum
is
to
be
used
for
reclamation
of
arid
lands
by
irrigation
and
per
centum
is
to
be
paid
to
the
states
in
which
the
operations
are
located
to
be
used
by
them
for
school
and
road
purposes
these
resources
are
so
vast
and
the
development
is
affording
so
reliable
a
basis
of
estimate
that
the
interior
department
expresses
the
belief
that
ultimately
the
present
law
will
add
in
royalties
and
payments
to
the
treasuries
of
the
federal
government
and
the
states
containing
these
public
lands
a
total
of
this
means
of
course
an
added
wealth
of
many
times
that
sum
these
prospects
seem
to
afford
every
justification
of
government
advances
in
reclamation
and
irrigation
contemplating
the
inevitable
and
desirable
increase
of
population
there
is
another
phase
of
reclamation
full
worthy
of
consideration
there
are
acres
of
swamp
and
cutover
lands
which
may
be
reclaimed
and
made
as
valuable
as
any
farm
lands
we
possess
these
acres
are
largely
located
in
southern
states
and
the
greater
proportion
is
owned
by
the
states
or
by
private
citizens
congress
has
a
report
of
the
survey
of
this
field
for
reclamation
and
the
feasibility
is
established
i
gladly
commend
federal
aid
by
way
of
advances
where
state
and
private
participation
is
assured
home
making
is
one
of
the
greater
benefits
which
government
can
bestow
measures
are
pending
embodying
this
sound
policy
to
which
we
may
well
adhere
it
is
easily
possible
to
make
available
permanent
homes
which
will
provide
in
turn
for
prosperous
american
families
without
injurious
competition
with
established
activities
or
imposition
on
wealth
already
acquired
while
we
are
thinking
of
promoting
the
fortunes
of
our
own
people
i
am
sure
there
is
room
in
the
sympathetic
thought
of
america
for
fellow
human
beings
who
are
suffering
and
dying
of
starvation
in
russia
a
severe
drought
in
the
valley
of
the
volga
has
plunged
people
into
grievous
famine
our
voluntary
agencies
are
exerting
themselves
to
the
utmost
to
save
the
lives
of
children
in
this
area
but
it
is
now
evident
that
unless
relief
is
afforded
the
loss
of
life

will
extend
into
many
millions
america
can
not
be
deaf
to
such
a
call
as
that
we
do
not
recognize
the
government
of
russia
nor
tolerate
the
propaganda
which
emanates
therefrom
but
we
do
not
forget
the
traditions
of
russian
friendship
we
may
put
aside
our
consideration
of
all
international
politics
and
fundamental
differences
in
government
the
big
thing
is
the
call
of
the
suffering
and
the
dying
unreservedly
i
recommend
the
appropriation
necessary
to
supply
the
american
relief
administration
with
bushels
of
corn
and
bushels
of
seed
grains
not
alone
to
halt
the
wave
of
death
through
starvation
but
to
enable
spring
planting
in
areas
where
the
seed
grains
have
been
exhausted
temporarily
to
stem
starvation
the
american
relief
administration
is
directed
in
russia
by
former
officers
of
our
own
armies
and
has
fully
demonstrated
its
ability
to
transport
and
distribute
relief
through
american
hands
without
hindrance
or
loss
the
time
has
come
to
add
the
governments
support
to
the
wonderful
relief
already
wrought
out
of
the
generosity
of
the
american
private
purse
i
am
not
unaware
that
we
have
suffering
and
privation
at
home
when
it
exceeds
the
capacity
for
the
relief
within
the
states
concerned
it
will
have
federal
consideration
it
seems
to
me
we
should
be
indifferent
to
our
own
heart
promptings
and
out
of
accord
with
the
spirit
which
acclaims
the
christmastide
if
we
do
not
give
out
of
our
national
abundance
to
lighten
this
burden
of
woe
upon
a
people
blameless
and
helpless
in
famines
peril
there
are
it
full
score
of
topics
concerning
which
it
would
be
becoming
to
address
you
and
on
which
i
hope
to
make
report
at
a
later
time
i
have
alluded
to
the
things
requiring
your
earlier
attention
however
i
can
not
end
this
limited
address
without
a
suggested
amendment
to
the
organic
law
many
of
us
belong
to
that
school
of
thought
which
is
hesitant
about
altering
the
fundamental
law
i
think
our
tax
problems
the
tendency
of
wealth
to
seek
nontaxable
investment
and
the
menacing
increase
of
public
debt
federal
state
and
municipalall
justify
a
proposal
to
change
the
constitution
so
as
to
end
the
issue
of
nontaxable
bonds
no
action
can
change
the
status
of
the
many
billions
outstanding
but
we
can
guard
against
future
encouragement
of
capitals
paralysis
while
a
halt
in
the
growth
of
public
indebtedness
would
be
beneficial
throughout
our
whole
land
such
a
change
in
the
constitution
must
be
very
thoroughly
considered
before
submission
there
ought
to
be
known
what
influence
it
will
have
on
the
inevitable
refunding
of
our
vast
national
debt
how
it
will
operate
on
the
necessary
refunding
of
state
and
municipal
debt
how
the
advantages
of
nation
over
state
and
municipality
or
the
contrary
may
be
avoided
clearly
the
states
would
not
ratify
to
their
own
apparent
disadvantage
i
suggest
the
consideration
because
the
drift
of
wealth
into
nontaxable
securities
is
hindering
the
flow
of
large
capital
to
our
industries
manufacturing
agricultural
and
carrying
until
we
are
discouraging
the
very
activities
which
make
our
wealth
agreeable
to
your
expressed
desire
and
in
complete
accord
with
the
purposes
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
there
is
in
washington
as
you
happily
know
an
international
conference
now
most
earnestly
at
work
on
plans
for
the
limitation
of
armament
a
naval
holiday
and
the
just
settlement
of
problems
which
might
develop
into
causes
of
international
disagreement
it
is
easy
to
believe
a
worldhope
is
centered
on
this

most
gratifying

not

i
to
the

of

the
foreign

of

and

to
a
degree
not
widely
realized
and
hardly
surpassed
by
any

factor
in

the
position
of

impose
upon
us
duties
which
we
can
not

are
to
be
true
to
our
ideals
the
tremendous
growth
of

has
already
made
that

a
very
real
factor

commercial
prosperity
of

with
the

the
foreign

of

unnecessary
wars
and
whether
our
foreign
policies
are
based
upon
an
intelligent
grasp
of
presentday
world
conditions
and
a
clear
view
of
the
potentialities
of
the
future
or
are
governed
by
a
temporary
and
timid
expediency
or
by
narrow
views
befitting
an
infant
nation
are
questions
in
the
alternative
consideration
of
which
must
convince
any
thoughtful
citizen
that
no
department
of
national
polity
offers
greater
opportunity
for
promoting
the
interests
of
the
whole
people
on
the
one
hand
or
greater
chance
on
the
other
of
permanent
national
injury
than
that
which
deals
with
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
the
fundamental
foreign
policies
of
the
united
states
should
be
raised
high
above
the
conflict
of
partisanship
and
wholly
dissociated
from
differences
as
to
domestic
policy
in
its
foreign
affairs
the
united
states
should
present
to
the
world
a
united
front
the
intellectual
financial
and
industrial
interests
of
the
country
and
the
publicist
the
wage
earner
the
farmer
and
citizen
of
whatever
occupation
must
cooperate
in
a
spirit
of
high
patriotism
to
promote
that
national
solidarity
which
is
indispensable
to
national
efficiency
and
to
the
attainment
of
national
ideals
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
all
foreign
powers
remain
upon
a
sound
basis
of
peace
harmony
and
friendship
a
greater
insistence
upon
justice
to
american
citizens
or
interests
wherever
it
may
have
been
denied
and
a
stronger
emphasis
of
the
need
of
mutuality
in
commercial
and
other
relations
have
only
served
to
strengthen
our
friendships
with
foreign
countries
by
placing
those
friendships
upon
a
firm
foundation
of
realities
as
well
as
aspirations
before
briefly
reviewing
the
more
important
events
of
the
last
year
in
our
foreign
relations
which
it
is
my
duty
to
do
as
charged
with
their
conduct
and
because
diplomatic
affairs
are
not
of
a
nature
to
make
it
appropriate
that
the
secretary
of
state
make
a
formal
annual
report
i
desire
to
touch
upon
some
of
the
essentials
to
the
safe
management
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
and
to
endeavor
also
to
define
clearly
certain
concrete
policies
which
are
the
logical
modern
corollaries
of
the
undisputed
and
traditional
fundamentals
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
reorganization
of
the
state
department
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
administration
the
united
states
having
fully
entered
upon
its
position
as
a
world
power
with
the
responsibilities
thrust
upon
it
by
the
results
of
the
spanishamerican
war
and
already
engaged
in
laying
the
groundwork
of
a
vast
foreign
trade
upon
which
it
should
one
day
become
more
and
more
dependent
found
itself
without
the
machinery
for
giving
thorough
attention
to
and
taking
effective
action
upon
a
mass
of
intricate
business
vital
to
american
interests
in
every
country
in
the
world
the
department
of
state
was
an
archaic
and
inadequate
machine
lacking
most
of
the
attributes
of
the
foreign
office
of
any
great
modern
power
with
an
appropriation
made
upon
my
recommendation
by
the
congress
on
august
the
department
of
state
was
completely
reorganized
there
were
created
divisions
of
latin
american
affairs
and
of
far
eastern
near
eastern
and
western
european
affairs
to
these
divisions
were
called
from
the
foreign
service
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
possessing
experience
and
knowledge
gained
by
actual
service
in
different
parts
of
the
world
and
thus
familiar
with
political
and
commercial
conditions
in
the
regions
concerned
the
work
was
highly
specialized
the
result
is
that
where
previously
this
government
from
time
to
time
would
emphasize
in
its
foreign
relations
one
or
another
policy
now
american
interests
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
are
being
cultivated
with
equal
assiduity
this
principle
of
politicogeographical
division
possesses
also
the
good
feature
of
making
possible
rotation
between
the
officers
of
the
departmental
the
diplomatic
and
the
consular
branches
of
the
foreign
service
and
thus
keeps
the
whole
diplomatic
and
consular
establishments
tinder
the
department
of
state
in
close
touch
and
equally
inspired
with
the
aims
and
policy
of
the
government
through
the
newly
created
division
of
information
the
foreign
service
is
kept
fully
informed
of
what
transpires
from
day
to
day
in
the
international
relations
of
the
country
and
contemporary
foreign
comment
affecting
american
interests
is
promptly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
department
the
law
offices
of
the
department
were
greatly
strengthened
there
were
added
foreign
trade
advisers
to
cooperate
with
the
diplomatic
and
consular
bureaus
and
the
politicogeographical
divisions
in
the
innumerable
matters
where
commercial
diplomacy
or
consular
work
calls
for
such
special
knowledge
the
same
officers
together
with
the
rest
of
the
new
organization
are
able
at
all
times
to
give
to
american
citizens
accurate
information
as
to
conditions
in
foreign
countries
with
which
they
have
business
and
likewise
to
cooperate
more
effectively
with
the
congress
and
also
with
the
other
executive
departments
merit
system
in
consular
and
diplomatic
corps
expert
knowledge
and
professional
training
must
evidently
be
the
essence
of
this
reorganization
without
a
trained
foreign
service
there
would
not
be
men
available
for
the
work
in
the
reorganized
department
of
state
president
cleveland
had
taken
the
first
step
toward
introducing
the
merit
system
in
the
foreign
service
that
had
been
followed
by
the
application
of
the
merit
principle
with
excellent
results
to
the
entire
consular
branch
almost
nothing
however
had
been
done
in
this
direction
with
regard
to
the
diplomatic
service
in
this
age
of
commercial
diplomacy
it
was
evidently
of
the
first
importance
to
train
an
adequate
personnel
in
that
branch
of
the
service
therefore
on
november
by
an
executive
order
i
placed
the
diplomatic
service
up
to
the
grade
of
secretary
of
embassy
inclusive
upon
exactly
the
same
strict
nonpartisan
basis
of
the
merit
system
rigid
examination
for
appointment
and
promotion
only
for
efficiency
as
had
been
maintained
without
exception
in
the
consular
service
statistics
as
to
merit
and
nonpartisan
character
of
appointments
how
faithful
to
the
merit
system
and
how
nonpartisan
has
been
the
conduct
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
services
in
the
last
four
years
may
be
judged
from
the
following
three
ambassadors
now
serving
held
their
present
rank
at
the
beginning
of
my
administration
of
the
ten
ambassadors
whom
i
have
appointed
five
were
by
promotion
from
the
rank
of
minister
nine
ministers
now
serving
held
their
present
rank
at
the
beginning
of
my
administration
of
the
thirty
ministers
whom
i
have
appointed
eleven
were
promoted
from
the
lower
grades
of
the
foreign
service
or
from
the
department
of
state
of
the
nineteen
missions
in
latin
america
where
our
relations
are
close
and
our
interest
is
great
fifteen
chiefs
of
mission
are
service
men
three
having
entered
the
service
during
this
administration
thirtyseven
secretaries
of
embassy
or
legation
who
have
received
their
initial
appointments
after
passing
successfully
the
required
examination
were
chosen
for
ascertained
fitness
without
regard
to
political
affiliations
a
dearth
of
candidates
from
southern
and
western
states
has
alone
made
it
impossible
thus
far
completely
to
equalize
all
the
states
representations
in
the
foreign
service
in
the
effort
to
equalize
the
representation
of
the
various
states
in
the
consular
service
i
have
made
sixteen
of
the
twentynine
new
appointments
as
consul
which
have
occurred
during
my
administration
from
the
southern
states
this
is
per
cent
every
other
consular
appointment
made
including
the
promotion
of
eleven
young
men
from
the
consular
assistant
and
student
interpreter
corps
has
been
by
promotion
or
transfer
based
solely
upon
efficiency
shown
in
the
service
in
order
to
assure
to
the
business
and
other
interests
of
the
united
states
a
continuance
of
the
resulting
benefits
of
this
reform
i
earnestly
renew
my
previous
recommendations
of
legislation
making
it
permanent
along
some
such
lines
as
those
of
the
measure
now
pending
in
congress
larger
provision
for
embassies
and
legations
and
for
other
expenses
of
our
foreign
representatives
recommended
in
connection
with
legislation
for
the
amelioration
of
the
foreign
service
i
wish
to
invite
attention
to
the
advisability
of
placing
the
salary
appropriations
upon
a
better
basis
i
believe
that
the
best
results
would
be
obtained
by
a
moderate
scale
of
salaries
with
adequate
funds
for
the
expense
of
proper
representation
based
in
each
case
upon
the
scale
and
cost
of
living
at
each
post
controlled
by
a
system
of
accounting
and
under
the
general
direction
of
the
department
of
state
in
line
with
the
object
which
i
have
sought
of
placing
our
foreign
service
on
a
basis
of
permanency
i
have
at
various
times
advocated
provision
by
congress
for
the
acquisition
of
governmentowned
buildings
for
the
residence
and
offices
of
our
diplomatic
officers
so
as
to
place
them
more
nearly
on
an
equality
with
similar
officers
of
other
nations
and
to
do
away
with
the
discrimination
which
otherwise
must
necessarily
b
e
made
in
some
cases
in
favor
of
men
having
large
private
fortunes
the
act
of
congress
which
i
approved
on
february
was
a
right
step
in
this
direction
the
secretary
of
state
has
already
made
the
limited
recommendations
permitted
by
the
act
for
any
one
year
and
it
is
my
hope
that
the
bill
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
to
carry
out
these
recommendations
will
be
favorably
acted
on
by
the
congress
during
its
present
session
in
some
latinamerican
countries
the
expense
of
governmentowned
legations
will
be
less
than
elsewhere
and
it
is
certainly
very
urgent
that
in
such
countries
as
some
of
the
republics
of
central
america
and
the
caribbean
where
it
is
peculiarly
difficult
to
rent
suitable
quarters
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
should
be
justly
and
adequately
provided
with
dignified
and
suitable
official
residences
indeed
it
is
high
time
that
the
dignity
and
power
of
this
great
nation
should
be
fittingly
signalized
by
proper
buildings
for
the
occupancy
of
the
nations
representatives
everywhere
abroad
diplomacy
a
hand
maid
of
commercial
intercourse
and
peace
the
diplomacy
of
the
present
administration
has
sought
to
respond
to
modern
ideas
of
commercial
intercourse
this
policy
has
been
characterized
as
substituting
dollars
for
bullets
it
is
one
that
appeals
alike
to
idealistic
humanitarian
sentiments
to
the
dictates
of
sound
policy
and
strategy
and
to
legitimate
commercial
aims
it
i
is
an
effort
frankly
directed
to
the
increase
of
american
trade
upon
the
axiomatic
principle
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
shall
extend
all
proper
support
to
every
legitimate
and
beneficial
american
enterprise
abroad
how
great
have
been
the
results
of
this
diplomacy
coupled
with
the
maximum
and
minimum
provision
of
the
tariff
law
will
be
seen
by
some
consideration
of
the
wonderful
increase
in
the
export
trade
of
the
united
states
because
modern
diplomacy
is
commercial
there
has
been
a
disposition
in
some
quarters
to
attribute
to
it
none
but
materialistic
aims
how
strikingly
erroneous
is
such
an
impression
may
be
seen
from
a
study
of
the
results
by
which
the
diplomacy
of
the
united
states
can
be
judged
successful
efforts
in
promotion
of
peace
in
the
field
of
work
toward
the
ideals
of
peace
this
government
negotiated
but
to
my
regret
was
unable
to
consummate
two
arbitration
treaties
which
set
the
highest
mark
of
the
aspiration
of
nations
toward
the
substitution
of
arbitration
and
reason
for
war
in
the
settlement
of
international
disputes
through
the
efforts
of
american
diplomacy
several
wars
have
been
prevented
or
ended
i
refer
to
the
successful
tripartite
mediation
of
the
argentine
republic
brazil
and
the
united
states
between
peru
and
ecuador
the
bringing
of
the
boundary
dispute
between
panama
and
costa
rica
to
peaceful
arbitration
the
staying
of
warlike
preparations
when
haiti
and
the
dominican
republic
were
on
the
verge
of
hostilities
the
stopping
of
a
war
in
nicaragua
the
halting
of
internecine
strife
in
honduras
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
thanked
for
its
influence
toward
the
restoration
of
amicable
relations
between
the
argentine
republic
and
bolivia
the
diplomacy
of
the
united
states
is
active
in
seeking
to
assuage
the
remaining
illfeeling
between
this
country
and
the
republic
of
colombia
in
the
recent
civil
war
in
china
the
united
states
successfully
joined
with
the
other
interested
powers
in
urging
an
early
cessation
of
hostilities
an
agreement
has
been
reached
between
the
governments
of
chile
and
peru
whereby
the
celebrated
tacnaarica
dispute
which
has
so
long
embittered
international
relations
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america
has
at
last
been
adjusted
simultaneously
came
the
news
that
the
boundary
dispute
between
peru
and
ecuador
had
entered
upon
a
stage
of
amicable
settlement
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
reference
to
the
tacnaarica
dispute
between
chile
and
peru
has
been
one
of
nonintervention
but
one
of
friendly
influence
and
pacific
counsel
throughout
the
period
during
which
the
dispute
in
question
has
been
the
subject
of
interchange
of
views
between
this
government
and
the
two
governments
immediately
concerned
in
the
general
easing
of
international
tension
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america
the
tripartite
mediation
to
which
i
have
referred
has
been
a
most
potent
and
beneficent
factor
china
in
china
the
policy
of
encouraging
financial
investment
to
enable
that
country
to
help
itself
has
had
the
result
of
giving
new
life
and
practical
application
to
the
opendoor
policy
the
consistent
purpose
of
the
present
administration
has
been
to
encourage
the
use
of
american
capital
in
the
development
of
china
by
the
promotion
of
those
essential
reforms
to
which
china
is
pledged
by
treaties
with
the
united
states
and
other
powers
the
hypothecation
to
foreign
bankers
in
connection
with
certain
industrial
enterprises
such
as
the
hukuang
railways
of
the
national
revenues
upon
which
these
reforms
depended
led
the
department
of
state
early
in
the
administration
to
demand
for
american
citizens
participation
in
such
enterprises
in
order
that
the
united
states
might
have
equal
rights
and
an
equal
voice
in
all
questions
pertaining
to
the
disposition
of
the
public
revenues
concerned
the
same
policy
of
promoting
international
accord
among
the
powers
having
similar
treaty
rights
as
ourselves
in
the
matters
of
reform
which
could
not
be
put
into
practical
effect
without
the
common
consent
of
all
was
likewise
adopted
in
the
case
of
the
loan
desired
by
china
for
the
reform
of
its
currency
the
principle
of
international
cooperation
in
matters
of
common
interest
upon
which
our
policy
had
already
been
based
in
all
of
the
above
instances
has
admittedly
been
a
great
factor
in
that
concert
of
the
powers
which
has
been
so
happily
conspicuous
during
the
perilous
period
of
transition
through
which
the
great
chinese
nation
has
been
passing
central
america
needs
our
help
in
debt
adjustment
in
central
america
the
aim
has
been
to
help
such
countries
as
nicaragua
and
honduras
to
help
themselves
they
are
the
immediate
beneficiaries
the
national
benefit
to
the
united
states
is
twofold
first
it
is
obvious
that
the
monroe
doctrine
is
more
vital
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
panama
canal
and
the
zone
of
the
caribbean
than
anywhere
else
there
too
the
maintenance
of
that
doctrine
falls
most
heavily
upon
the
united
states
it
is
therefore
essential
that
the
countries
within
that
sphere
shall
be
removed
from
the
jeopardy
involved
by
heavy
foreign
debt
and
chaotic
national
finances
and
from
the
everpresent
danger
of
international
complications
due
to
disorder
at
home
hence
the
united
states
has
been
glad
to
encourage
and
support
american
bankers
who
were
willing
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
the
financial
rehabilitation
of
such
countries
because
this
financial
rehabilitation
and
the
protection
of
their
customhouses
from
being
the
prey
of
would
be
dictators
would
remove
at
one
stroke
the
menace
of
foreign
creditors
and
the
menace
of
revolutionary
disorder
the
second
advantage
of
the
united
states
is
one
affecting
chiefly
all
the
southern
and
gulf
ports
and
the
business
and
industry
of
the
south
the
republics
of
central
america
and
the
caribbean
possess
great
natural
wealth
they
need
only
a
measure
of
stability
and
the
means
of
financial
regeneration
to
enter
upon
an
era
of
peace
and
prosperity
bringing
profit
and
happiness
to
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
creating
conditions
sure
to
lead
to
a
flourishing
interchange
of
trade
with
this
country
i
wish
to
call
your
especial
attention
to
the
recent
occurrences
in
nicaragua
for
i
believe
the
terrible
events
recorded
there
during
the
revolution
of
the
past
summerthe
useless
loss
of
life
the
devastation
of
property
the
bombardment
of
defenseless
cities
the
killing
and
wounding
of
women
and
children
the
torturing
of
noncombatants
to
exact
contributions
and
the
suffering
of
thousands
of
human
beingsmight
have
been
averted
had
the
department
of
state
through
approval
of
the
loan
convention
by
the
senate
been
permitted
to
carry
out
its
now
welldeveloped
policy
of
encouraging
the
extending
of
financial
aid
to
weak
central
american
states
with
the
primary
objects
of
avoiding
just
such
revolutions
by
assisting
those
republics
to
rehabilitate
their
finances
to
establish
their
currency
on
a
stable
basis
to
remove
the
customhouses
from
the
danger
of
revolutions
by
arranging
for
their
secure
administration
and
to
establish
reliable
banks
during
this
last
revolution
in
nicaragua
the
government
of
that
republic
having
admitted
its
inability
to
protect
american
life
and
property
against
acts
of
sheer
lawlessness
on
the
part
of
the
malcontents
and
having
requested
this
government
to
assume
that
office
it
became
necessary
to
land
over
marines
and
bluejackets
in
nicaragua
owing
to
their
presence
the
constituted
government
of
nicaragua
was
free
to
devote
its
attention
wholly
to
its
internal
troubles
and
was
thus
enabled
to
stamp
out
the
rebellion
in
a
short
space
of
time
when
the
red
cross
supplies
sent
to
granada
had
been
exhausted
persons
having
been
given
food
in
one
day
upon
the
arrival
of
the
american
forces
our
men
supplied
other
unfortunate
needy
nicaraguans
from
their
own
haversacks
i
wish
to
congratulate
the
officers
and
men
of
the
united
states
navy
and
marine
corps
who
took
part
in
reestablishing
order
in
nicaragua
upon
their
splendid
conduct
and
to
record
with
sorrow
the
death
of
seven
american
marines
and
bluejackets
since
the
reestablishment
of
peace
and
order
elections
have
been
held
amid
conditions
of
quiet
and
tranquility
nearly
all
the
american
marines
have
now
been
withdrawn
the
country
should
soon
be
on
the
road
to
recovery
the
only
apparent
danger
now
threatening
nicaragua
arises
from
the
shortage
of
funds
although
american
bankers
have
already
rendered
assistance
they
may
naturally
be
loath
to
advance
a
loan
adequate
to
set
the
country
upon
its
feet
without
the
support
of
some
such
convention
as
that
of
june
upon
which
the
senate
has
not
yet
acted
enforcement
of
neutrality
laws
in
t
he
general
effort
to
contribute
to
the
enjoyment
of
peace
by
those
republics
which
are
near
neighbors
of
the
united
states
the
administration
has
enforced
the
socalled
neutrality
statutes
with
a
new
vigor
and
those
statutes
were
greatly
strengthened
in
restricting
the
exportation
of
arms
and
munitions
by
the
joint
resolution
of
last
march
it
is
still
a
regrettable
fact
that
certain
american
ports
are
made
the
rendezvous
of
professional
revolutionists
and
others
engaged
in
intrigue
against
the
peace
of
those
republics
it
must
be
admitted
that
occasionally
a
revolution
in
this
region
is
justified
as
a
real
popular
movement
to
throw
off
the
shackles
of
a
vicious
and
tyrannical
government
such
was
the
nicaraguan
revolution
against
the
zelaya
regime
a
nation
enjoying
our
liberal
institutions
can
not
escape
sympathy
with
a
true
popular
movement
and
one
so
well
justified
in
very
many
cases
however
revolutions
in
the
republics
in
question
have
no
basis
in
principle
but
are
due
merely
to
the
machinations
of
conscienceless
and
ambitious
men
and
have
no
effect
but
to
bring
new
suffering
and
fresh
burdens
to
an
already
oppressed
people
the
question
whether
the
use
of
american
ports
as
foci
of
revolutionary
intrigue
can
be
best
dealt
with
by
a
further
amendment
to
the
neutrality
statutes
or
whether
it
would
be
safer
to
deal
with
special
cases
by
special
laws
is
one
worthy
of
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
visit
of
secretary
knox
to
central
america
and
the
caribbean
impressed
with
the
particular
importance
of
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
republics
of
central
america
and
the
caribbean
region
which
of
necessity
must
become
still
more
intimate
by
reason
of
the
mutual
advantages
which
will
be
presented
by
the
opening
of
the
panama
canal
i
directed
the
secretary
of
state
last
february
to
visit
these
republics
for
the
purpose
of
giving
evidence
of
the
sincere
friendship
and
good
will
which
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
bear
toward
them
ten
republics
were
visited
everywhere
he
was
received
with
a
cordiality
of
welcome
and
a
generosity
of
hospitality
such
as
to
impress
me
deeply
and
to
merit
our
warmest
thanks
the
appreciation
of
the
governments
and
people
of
the
countries
visited
which
has
been
appropriately
shown
in
various
ways
leaves
me
no
doubt
that
his
visit
will
conduce
to
that
closer
union
and
better
understanding
between
the
united
states
and
those
republics
which
i
have
had
it
much
at
heart
to
promote
our
mexican
policy
for
two
years
revolution
and
counterrevolution
has
distraught
the
neighboring
republic
of
mexico
brigandage
has
involved
a
great
deal
of
depredation
upon
foreign
interests
there
have
constantly
recurred
questions
of
extreme
delicacy
on
several
occasions
very
difficult
situations
have
arisen
on
our
frontier
throughout
this
trying
period
the
policy
of
the
united
states
has
been
one
of
patient
nonintervention
steadfast
recognition
of
constituted
authority
in
the
neighboring
nation
and
the
exertion
of
every
effort
to
care
for
american
interests
i
profoundly
hope
that
the
mexican
nation
may
soon
resume
the
path
of
order
prosperity
and
progress
to
that
nation
in
its
sore
troubles
the
sympathetic
friendship
of
the
united
states
has
been
demonstrated
to
a
high
degree
there
were
in
mexico
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
some
thirty
or
forty
thousand
american
citizens
engaged
in
enterprises
contributing
greatly
to
the
prosperity
of
that
republic
and
also
benefiting
the
important
trade
between
the
two
countries
the
investment
of
american
capital
in
mexico
has
been
estimated
at
the
responsibility
of
endeavoring
to
safeguard
those
interests
and
the
dangers
inseparable
from
propinquity
to
so
turbulent
a
situation
have
been
great
but
i
am
happy
to
have
been
able
to
adhere
to
the
policy
above
outlineda
policy
which
i
hope
may
be
soon
justified
by
the
complete
success
of
the
mexican
people
in
regaining
the
blessings
of
peace
and
good
order
agricultural
credits
a
most
important
work
accomplished
in
the
past
year
by
the
american
diplomatic
officers
in
europe
is
the
investigation
of
the
agricultural
credit
system
in
the
european
countries
both
as
a
means
to
afford
relief
to
the
consumers
of
this
country
through
a
more
thorough
development
of
agricultural
resources
and
as
a
means
of
more
sufficiently
maintaining
the
agricultural
population
the
project
to
establish
credit
facilities
for
the
farmers
is
a
concern
of
vital
importance
to
this
nation
no
evidence
of
prosperity
among
wellestablished
farmers
should
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
lack
of
capital
is
preventing
a
development
of
the
nations
agricultural
resources
and
an
adequate
increase
of
the
land
under
cultivation
that
agricultural
production
is
fast
falling
behind
the
increase
in
population
and
that
in
fact
although
these
wellestablished
farmers
are
maintained
in
increasing
prosperity
because
of
the
natural
increase
in
population
we
are
not
developing
the
industry
of
agriculture
we
are
not
breeding
in
proportionate
numbers
a
race
of
independent
and
independenceloving
landowners
for
a
lack
of
which
no
growth
of
cities
can
compensate
our
farmers
have
been
our
mainstay
in
times
of
crisis
and
in
future
it
must
still
largely
be
upon
their
stability
and
common
sense
that
this
democracy
must
rely
to
conserve
its
principles
of
selfgovernment
the
need
of
capital
which
american
farmers
feel
today
had
been
experienced
by
the
farmers
of
europe
with
their
centuriesold
farms
many
years
ago
the
problem
had
been
successfully
solved
in
the
old
world
and
it
was
evident
that
the
farmers
of
this
country
might
profit
by
a
study
of
their
systems
i
therefore
ordered
through
the
department
of
state
an
investigation
to
be
made
by
the
diplomatic
officers
in
europe
and
i
have
laid
the
results
of
this
investigation
before
the
governors
of
the
various
states
with
the
hope
that
they
will
be
used
to
advantage
in
their
forthcoming
meeting
increase
of
foreign
trade
in
my
last
annual
message
i
said
that
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
was
noteworthy
as
marking
the
highest
record
of
exports
of
american
products
to
foreign
countries
the
fiscal
year
shows
that
this
rate
of
advance
has
been
maintained
the
total
domestic
exports
having
a
valuation
approximately
of
as
compared
with
a
fraction
over
the
previous
year
it
is
also
significant
that
manufactured
and
partly
manufactured
articles
continue
to
be
the
chief
commodities
forming
the
volume
of
our
augmented
exports
the
demands
of
our
own
people
for
consumption
requiring
that
an
increasing
proportion
of
our
abundant
agricultural
products
be
kept
at
home
in
the
fiscal
year
the
exports
of
articles
in
the
various
stages
of
manufacture
not
including
foodstuffs
partly
or
wholly
manufactured
amounted
approximately
to
in
the
fiscal
year
the
total
was
nearly
a
gain
of
advantage
of
maximum
and
minimum
tariff
provision
the
importance
which
our
manufactures
have
assumed
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
in
competition
with
the
manufactures
of
other
countries
again
draws
attention
to
the
duty
of
this
government
to
use
its
utmost
endeavors
to
secure
impartial
treatment
for
american
products
in
all
markets
healthy
commercial
rivalry
in
international
intercourse
is
best
assured
by
the
possession
of
proper
means
for
protecting
and
promoting
our
foreign
trade
it
is
natural
that
competitive
countries
should
view
with
some
concern
this
steady
expansion
of
our
commerce
if
in
some
instance
the
measures
taken
by
them
to
meet
it
are
not
entirely
equitable
a
remedy
should
be
found
in
former
messages
i
have
described
the
negotiations
of
the
department
of
state
with
foreign
governments
for
the
adjustment
of
the
maximum
and
minimum
tariff
as
provided
in
section
of
the
tariff
law
of
the
advantages
secured
by
the
adjustment
of
our
trade
relations
under
this
law
have
continued
during
the
last
year
and
some
additional
cases
of
discriminatory
treatment
of
which
we
had
reason
to
complain
have
been
removed
the
department
of
state
has
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
country
obtained
substantial
mostfavorednation
treatment
from
all
the
countries
of
the
world
there
are
however
other
instances
which
while
apparently
not
constituting
undue
discrimination
in
the
sense
of
section
are
nevertheless
exceptions
to
the
complete
equity
of
tariff
treatment
for
american
products
that
the
department
of
state
consistently
has
sought
to
obtain
for
american
commerce
abroad
necessity
for
supplementary
legislation
these
developments
confirm
the
opinion
conveyed
to
you
in
my
annual
message
of
that
while
the
maximum
and
minimum
provision
of
the
tariff
law
of
has
been
fully
justified
by
the
success
achieved
in
removing
previously
existing
undue
discriminations
against
american
products
yet
experience
has
shown
that
this
feature
of
the
law
should
be
amended
in
such
way
as
to
provide
a
fully
effective
means
of
meeting
the
varying
degrees
of
discriminatory
treatment
of
american
commerce
in
foreign
countries
still
encountered
as
well
as
to
protect
against
injurious
treatment
on
the
part
of
foreign
governments
through
either
legislative
or
administrative
measures
the
financial
interests
abroad
of
american
citizens
whose
enterprises
enlarge
the
market
for
american
commodities
i
can
not
too
strongly
recommend
to
the
congress
the
passage
of
some
such
enabling
measure
as
the
bill
which
was
recommended
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
his
letter
of
december
the
object
of
the
proposed
legislation
is
in
brief
to
enable
the
executive
to
apply
as
the
case
may
require
to
any
or
all
commodities
whether
or
not
on
the
free
list
from
a
country
which
discriminates
against
the
united
states
a
graduated
scale
of
duties
up
to
the
maximum
of
per
cent
ad
valorem
provided
in
the
present
law
flat
tariffs
are
out
of
date
nations
no
longer
accord
equal
tariff
treatment
to
all
other
nations
irrespective
of
the
treatment
from
them
received
such
a
flexible
power
at
the
command
of
the
executive
would
serve
to
moderate
any
unfavorable
tendencies
on
the
part
of
those
countries
from
which
the
importations
i
nto
the
united
states
are
substantially
confined
to
articles
on
the
free
list
as
well
as
of
the
countries
which
find
a
lucrative
market
in
the
united
states
for
their
products
under
existing
customs
rates
it
is
very
necessary
that
the
american
government
should
be
equipped
with
weapons
of
negotiation
adapted
to
modern
economic
conditions
in
order
that
we
may
at
all
times
be
in
a
position
to
gain
not
only
technically
just
but
actually
equitable
treatment
for
our
trade
and
also
for
american
enterprise
and
vested
interests
abroad
business

to
our
country
by

official
effort
as
illustrating
the
commercial
benefits
of
the
nation
derived
from
the
new
diplomacy
and
its
effectiveness
upon
the
material
as
well
as
the
more
ideal
side
it
may
be
remarked
that
through
direct
official
efforts
alone
there
have
been
obtained
in
the
course
of
this
administration
contracts
from
foreign
governments
involving
an
expenditure
of
in
the
factories
of
the
united
states
consideration
of
this
fact
and
some
reflection
upon
the
necessary
effects
of
a
scientific
tariff
system
and
a
foreign
service
alert
and
equipped
to
cooperate
with
the
business
men
of
america
carry
the
conviction
that
the
gratifying
increase
in
the
export
trade
of
this
country
is
in
substantial
amount
due
to
our
improved
governmental
methods
of
protecting
and
stimulating
it
it
is
germane
to
these
observations
to
remark
that
in
the
two
years
that
have
elapsed
since
the
successful
negotiation
of
our
new
treaty
with
japan
which
at
the
time
seemed
to
present
so
many
practical
difficulties
our
export
trade
to
that
country
has
increased
at
the
rate
of
over
a
month
our
exports
to
japan
for
the
year
ended
june
were
while
for
the
year

the
exports
were
a
net
increase
in

american

nearly
per

under
the
special
agreement
entered
into
between
the
united

and
great

on
august
for
the

of
outstanding
pecuniary
claims
a

of

and
the

of

have
been
agreed
upon
by
the
two
governments
and
together
with
the
special

were
approved
by
the
senate
on
july
but
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement
they
did
not
go
into
effect
until
confirmed
by
the
two
governments
by
an
exchange
of
notes
which
was
done
on
april
last

are
still
in
progress
for

the

being
carried
on
under
the
authority

made
for

purpose
at
the
last

it
is
anticipated
that
the

will
be
prepared
to
call
upon
the
arbitration
tribunal
established
under
this
agreement
to
meet
at
washington
early
next
year
to
proceed
with
this
arbitration
fur

and
need
for
amendment
of
our
statute
the
act
adopted
at
the
last
session
of
congress
to
give
effect
to
the
furseal
convention
of
july
between

provided
for
the
suspension
of
all
land
killing
of
seals
on
the
pribilof
islands
for
a
period
of
five
years
and
an
objection
has
now
been
presented
to
this
provision
by
the
other
parties
in
interest
which
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
prohibition
of
land
killing
is
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
if
not
the
letter
of
the

stipulations
the
justification
of
establishing
this
close

depends
under
the
terms
of
the
convention
upon
how
far
if
at
all
it
is
necessary
for
protecting
and
preserving
the
american
furseal
herd
and
for
increasing
its
number
this
is
a
question
requiring
examination
of
the
present
condition
of
the
herd
and
the
treatment
which
it
needs
in
the
light
of
actual
experience
and
scientific
investigation
a
careful
examination
of
the
subject
is
now
being
made
and
this
government
will
soon
be
in
possession
of
a
considerable
amount
of
new
information
about
the
american
seal
herd
which
has
been
secured
during
the
past
season
and
will
be
of
great
value
in
determining
this
question
and
if
it
should
appear
that
there
is
any
uncertainty
as
to
the
real
necessity
for
imposing
a
close
season
at
this
time
i
shall
take
an
early
opportunity
to
address
a
special
message
to
congress
on
this
subject
in
the
belief
that
this
government
should
yield
on
this
point
rather
than
give
the
slightest
ground
for
the
charge
that
we
have
been
in
any
way
remiss
in
observing
our
treaty
obligations
final
settlement
of
north
atlantic
fisheries
dispute
on
the
th
of
july
last
an
agreement
was
concluded
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
adopting
with
certain
modifications
the
rules
and
method
of
procedure
recommended
in
the
award
rendered
by
the
north
atlantic
coast
fisheries
arbitration
tribunal
on
september
for
the
settlement
hereafter
in
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down
in
the
award
of
questions
arising
with
reference
to
the
exercise
of
the
american
fishing
liberties
under
article
i
of
the
treaty
of
october
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
this
agreement
received
the
approval
of
the
senate
on
august
i
and
was
formally
ratified
by
the
two
governments
on
november
last
the
rules
and
a
method
of
procedure
embodied
in
the
award
provided
for
determining
by
an
impartial
tribunal
the
reasonableness
of
any
new
fishery
regulations
on
the
treaty
coasts
of
newfoundland
and
canada
before
such
regulations
could
be
enforced
against
american
fishermen
exercising
their
treaty
liberties
on
those
coasts
and
also
for
determining
the
delimitation
of
bays
on
such
coasts
more
than
miles
wide
in
accordance
with
the
definition
adopted
by
the
tribunal
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
bays
as
used
in
the
treaty
in
the
subsequent
negotiations
between
the
two
governments
undertaken
for
the
purpose
of
giving
practical
effect
to
these
rules
and
methods
of
procedure
it
was
found
that
certain
modifications
therein
were
desirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
both
governments
and
these
negotiations
have
finally
resulted
in
the
agreement
above
mentioned
by
which
the
award
recommendations
as
modified
by
mutual
consent
of
the
two
governments
are
finally
adopted
and
made
effective
thus
bringing
this
centuryold
controversy
to
a
final
conclusion
which
is
equally
beneficial
and
satisfactory
to
both
governments
imperial
valley
and
mexico
in
order
to
make
possible
the
more
effective
performance
of
the
work
necessary
for
the
confinement
in
their
present
channel
of
the
waters
of
the
lower
colorado
river
and
thus
to
protect
the
people
of
the
imperial
valley
as
well
as
in
order
to
reach
with
the
government
of
mexico
an
understanding
regarding
the
distribution
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
in
which
both
governments
are
much
interested
negotiations
are
going
forward
with
a
view
to
the
establishment
of
a
preliminary
colorado
river
commission
which
shall
have
the
powers
necessary
to
enable
it
to
do
the
needful
work
and
with
authority
to
study
the
question
of
the
equitable
distribution
of
the
waters
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
an
understanding
upon
this
point
will
be
reached
and
that
an
agreement
will
be
signed
in
the
near
future
chamizal
dispute
in
the
interest
of
the
people
and
city
of
el
paso
this
government
has
been
assiduous
in
its
efforts
to
bring
to
an
early
settlement
the
longstanding
chamizal
dispute
with
mexico
much
has
been
accomplished
and
while
the
final
solution
of
the
dispute
is
not
immediate
the
favorable
attitude
lately
assumed
by
the
mexican
government
encourages
the
hope
that
this
troublesome
question
will
be
satisfactorily
and
definitively
settled
at
an
early
day
international
commission
of
jurists
in
pursuance
of
the
convention
of
august
signed
at
the
third
pan
american
conference
held
at
rio
de
janeiro
the
international
commission
of
jurists
met
at
that
capital
during
the
month
of
last
june
at
this
meeting
american
republics
were
represented
including
the
united
states
and
comprehensive
plans
for
the
future
work
of
the
commission
were
adopted
at
the
next
meeting
fixed
for
june
committees
already
appointed
are
instructed
to
i
report
regarding
topics
assigned
to
them
opium
conferenceunfortunate
failure
of
our
government
to
enact
recommended
legislation
in
my
message
on
foreign
relations
communicated
to
the
two
houses
of
congress
december
i
called
especial
attention
to
the
assembling
of
the
opium
conference
at
the
hague
to
the
fact
that
that
conference
was
to
review
all
pertinent
municipal
laws
relating
to
the
opium
and
allied
evils
and
certainly
all
international
rules
regarding
these
evils
and
to
the
fact
that
it
seemed
to
me
most
essential
that
the
congress
should
take
immediate
action
on
the
antinarcotic
legislation
before
the
congress
to
which
i
had
previously
called
attention
by
a
special
message
the
international
convention
adopted
by
the
conference
conforms
almost
entirely
to
the
principles
contained
in
the
proposed
antinarcotic
legislation
which
has
been
before
the
last
two
congresses
it
was
most
unfortunate
that
this
government
having
taken
the
initiative
in
the
international
action
which
eventuated
in
the
important
international
opium
convention
failed
to
do
its
share
in
the
great
work
by
neglecting
to
pass
the
necessary
legislation
to
correct
the
deplorable
narcotic
evils
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
to
redeem
international
pledges
upon
which
it
entered
by
virtue
of
the
abovementioned
convention
the
congress
at
its
present
session
should
enact
into
law
those
bills
now
before
it
which
have
been
so
carefully
drawn
up
in
collaboration
between
the
department
of
state
and
the
other
executive
departments
and
which
have
behind
them
not
only
the
moral
sentiment
of
the
country
but
the
practical
support
of
all
the
legitimate
trade
interests
likely
to
be
affected
since
the
international
convention
was
signed
adherence
to
it
has
been
made
by
several
european
states
not
represented
at
the
conference
at
the
hague
and
also
by
seventeen
latinamerican
rep
ublics
europe
and
the
near
east
the
war
between
italy
and
turkey
came
to
a
close
in
october
last
by
the
signature
of
a
treaty
of
peace
subsequently
to
which
the
ottoman
empire
renounced
sovereignty
over
cyrenaica
and
tripolitania
in
favor
of
italy
during
the
past
year
the
near
east
has
unfortunately
been
the
theater
of
constant
hostilities
almost
simultaneously
with
the
conclusion
of
peace
between
italy
and
turkey
and
their
arrival
at
an
adjustment
of
the
complex
questions
at
issue
between
them

broke
out
between
turkey
on
the
one
hand
and
bulgaria
greece
montenegro
and
servia
on
the
other
the
united
states
has
happily
been
involved
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
with
the
causes
or
questions
incident
to
any
of
these
hostilities
and
has
maintained
in
regard
to
them
an
attitude
of
absolute
neutrality
and
of
complete
political
disinterestedness
in
the
second
war
in
which
the
ottoman
empire
has
been
engaged
the
loss
of
life
and
the
consequent
distress
on
both
sides
have
been
appalling
and
the
united
states
has
found
occasion
in
the
interest
of
humanity
to
carry
out
the
charitable
desires
of
the
american
people
to
extend
a
measure
of
relief
to
the
sufferers
on
either
side
through
the
impartial
medium
of
the
red
cross
beyond
this
the
chief
care
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
been
to
make
due
provision
for
the
protection
of
its
national
resident
in
belligerent
territory
in
the
exercise
of
my
duty
in
this
matter
i
have
dispatched
to
turkish
waters
a
specialservice
squadron
consisting
of
two
armored
cruisers
in
order
that
this
government
may
if
need
be
bear
its
part
in
such
measures
as
it
may
be
necessary
for
the
interested
nations
to
adopt
for
the
safeguarding
of
foreign
lives
and
property
in
the
ottoman
empire
in
the
event
that
a
dangerous
situation
should
develop
in
the
meanwhile
the
several
interested
european
powers
have
promised
to
extend
to
american
citizens
the
benefit
of
such
precautionary
or
protective
measures
as
they
might
adopt
in
the
same
manner
in
which
it
has
been
the
practice
of
this
government
to
extend
its
protection
to
all
foreign
residents
in
those
countries
of
the
western
hemisphere
in
which
it
has
from
time
to
time
been
the
task
of
the
united
states
to
act
in
the
interest
of
peace
and
good
order
the
early
appearance
of
a
large
fleet
of
european
warships
in
the
bosphorus
apparently
assured
the
protection
of
foreigners
in
that
quarter
where
the
presence
of
the
american
stationnaire
the
u

s
scorpion
sufficed
tinder
the
circumstances
to
represent
the
united
states
our
cruisers
were
thus
left
free
to
act
if
need
be
along
the
mediterranean
coasts
should
any
unexpected
contingency
arise
affecting
the
numerous
american
interests
in
the
neighborhood
of
smyrna
and
beirut
spitzbergen
the
great
preponderance
of
american
material
interests
in
the
subarctic
island
of
spitzbergen
which
has
always
been
regarded
politically
as
no
mans
land
impels
this
government
to
a
continued
and
lively
interest
in
the
international
dispositions
to
be
made
for
the
political
governance
and
administration
of
that
region
the
conflict
of
certain
claims
of
american
citizens
and
others
is
in
a
fair
way
to
adjustment
while
the
settlement
of
matters
of
administration
whether
by
international
conference
of
the
interested
powers
or
otherwise
continues
to
be
the
subject
of
exchange
of
views
between
the
governments
concerned
liberia
as
a
result
of
the
efforts
of
this
government
to
place
the
government
of

in
position
to
pay
its
outstanding
indebtedness
and
to
maintain
a
stable
and
efficient
government
negotiations
for
a
loan
of
have
been
successfully
concluded
and
it
is
anticipated
that
the
payment
of
the
old
loan
and
the
issuance
of
the
bonds
of
the
loan
for
the
rehabilitation
of
the
finances
of
liberia
will
follow
at
an
early
date
when
the
new
receivership
will
go
into
active
operation
the
new
receivership
will
consist
of
a
general
receiver
of

designated
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
three
receivers
of
customs
designated
by
the
governments
of

france
and

britain
which
countries
have
commercial
interests
in
the
republic
of
liberia
in
carrying
out
the
understanding
between
the
government
of
liberia
and
that
of
the
united

and
in
fulfilling
the
terms
of
the
agreement
between
the
former
government
and
the
american
bankers
three
competent
exarmy
officers
are
now
effectively
employed
by
the
liberian
government
in
reorganizing
the
police
force
of
the
republic
not
only
to
keep
in
order
the
native
tribes
in
the
hinterland
but
to
serve
as
a
necessary
police
force
along
the
frontier
it
is
hoped
that
these
measures
will
assure
not
only
the
continued
existence
but
the
prosperity
and
welfare
of
the
republic
of
liberia
liberia
possesses
fertility
of
soil
and
natural
resources
which
should
insure
to
its
people
a
reasonable
prosperity
it
was
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
assist
the
republic
of
liberia
in
accordance
with
our
historical
interest
and
moral
guardianship
of
a
community
founded
by
american
citizens
as
it
was
also
the
duty
of
the
american
government
to
attempt
to
assure
permanence
to
a
country
of
much
sentimental
and
perhaps
future
real
interest
to
a
large
body
of
our
citizens
morocco
the
legation
at
tangier
is
now
in
charge
of
our
consul
general
who
is
acting
as
charge
daffaires
as
well
as
caring
for
our
commercial
interests
in
that
country
in
view
of
the
fact
that
many
of
the
foreign
powers
are
now
represented
by
charges
daffaires
it
has
not
been
deemed
necessary
to
appoint
at
the
present
time
a
minister
to
fill
a
vacancy
occurring
in
that
post
the
far
east
the
political
disturbances
in
china
in
the
autumn
and
winter
of
resulted
in
the
abdication
of
the
manchu
rulers
on
february
followed
by
the
formation
of
a
provisional
republican
government
empowered
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
nation
until
a
permanent
government
might
be
regularly
established
the
natural
sympathy
of
the
american
people
with
the
assumption
of
republican
principles
by
the
chinese
people
was
appropriately
expressed
in
a
concurrent
resolution
of
congress
on
april
a
constituent
assembly
composed
of
representatives
duly
chosen
by
the
people
of
china
in
the
elections
that
are
now
being
held
has
been
called
to
meet
in
january
next
to
adopt
a
permanent
constitution
and
organize
the
government
of
the
nascent
republic
during
the
formative
constitutional
stage
and

definite
action
by
the
assembly
as
expressive
of
the
popular
will
and
the
hopedfor
establishment
of
a
stable
republican
form
of
government
capable
of
fulfilling
its
international
obligations
the
united
states
is
according
to
precedent
maintaining
full
and
friendly
de
facto
relations
with
the
provisional
government
the
new
condition
of
affairs
thus
created
has
presented
many
serious
and
complicated
problems
both
of
internal
rehabilitation
and
of
international
relations
whose
solution
it
was
realized
would
necessarily
require
much
time
and
patience
from
the
beginning
of
the
upheaval
last
autumn
it
was
felt
by
the
united
states
in
common
with
the
other
powers
having
large
interests
in
china
that
independent
action
by
the
foreign
governments
in
their
own
individual
interests
would
add
further
confusion
to
a
situation
already
complicated
a
policy
of
international
cooperation
was
accordingly
adopted
in
an
understanding
reached
early
in
the
disturbances
to
act
together
for
the
protection
of
the
lives
and
property
of
foreigners
if
menaced
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
strict
impartiality
as
between
the
contending
factions
and
to
abstain
from
any
endeavor
to
influence
the
chinese
in
their
organization
of
a
new
form
of
government
in
view
of
the
seriousness
of
the
disturbances
and
their
general
character
the
american
minister
at
peking
was
instructed
at
his
discretion
to
advise
our
nationals
in
the
affected
districts
to
concentrate
at
such
centers
as
were
easily
accessible
to
foreign
troops
or
men
of
war
nineteen
of
our
naval
vessels
were
stationed
at
various
chinese
ports
and
other
measures
were
promptly
taken
for
the
adequate
protection
of
american
interests
it
was
further
mutually
agreed
in
the
hope
of
hastening
an
end
to
hostilities
that
none
of
the
interested
powers
would
approve
the
making
of
loans
by
its
nationals
to
either
side
as
soon
however
as
a
united
provisional
government
of
china
was
assured
the
united
states
joined
in
a
favorable
consideration
of
that
governments
request
for
advances
needed
for
immediate
administrative
necessities
and
later
for
a
loan
to
effect
a
permanent
national
reorganization
the
interested
governments
had
already
by
common
consent
adopted
in
respect
to
the
purposes
expenditure
and
security
of
any
loans
to
china
made
by
their
nationals
certain
conditions
which
were
held
to
be
essential
not
only
to
secure
reasonable
protection
for
the
foreign
investors
but
also
to
safeguard
and
strengthen
chinas
credit
by
discouraging
indiscriminate
borrowing
and
by
insuring
the
application
of
the
funds
toward
the
establishment
of
the
stable
and
effective
government
necessary
to
chinas
welfare
in

defenses
last
year
a
revolution
against
the
established
government
of
ecuador
broke
out
at
the
principal
port
of
that
republic
previous
to
this
occurrence
the
chief
american
interest
in
ecuador
represented
by
the
guayaquil
quito
railway
co
incorporated
in
the
united
states
had
rendered
extensive
transportation
and
other
services
on
account
to
the
ecuadorian
government
the
amount
of
which
ran
into
a
sum
which
was
steadily
increasing
and
which
the
ecuadorian
government
had
made
no
provision
to
pay
thereby
threatening
to
crush
out
the
very
existence
of
this
american
enterprise
when
tranquillity
had
been
restored
to
ecuador
as
a
result
of
the
triumphant
progress
of
the
government
forces
from
quito
this
government
interposed
its
good
offices
to
the
end
that
the
american
interests
in
ecuador
might
be
saved
from
complete
extinction
as
a
part
of
the
arrangement
which
was
reached
between
the
parties
and
at
the
request
of
the
government
of
ecuador
i
have
consented
to
name
an
arbitrator
who
acting
under
the
terms
of
the
railroad
contract
with
an
arbitrator
named
by
the
ecuadorian
government
will
pass
upon
the
claims
that
have
arisen
since
the
arrangement
reached
through
the
action
of
a
similar
arbitral
tribunal
in
in
pursuance
of
a
request
made
some
time
ago
by
the
ecuadorian
government
the
department
of
state
has
given
much
attention
to
the
problem
of
the
proper
sanitation
of
guayaquil
as
a
result
a
detail
of
officers
of
the
canal
zone
will
be
sent
to
guayaquil
to
recommend
measures
that
will
lead
to
the
complete
permanent
sanitation
of
this
plague
and
fever
infected
region
of
that
republic
which
has
for
so
long
constituted
a
menace
to
health
conditions
on
the
canal
zone
it
is
hoped
that
the
report
which
this
mission
will
furnish
will
point
out
a
way
whereby
the
modicum
of
assistance
which
the
united
states
may
properly
lend
the
ecuadorian
government
may
be
made
effective
in
ridding
the
west
coast
of
south
america
of
a
focus
of
contagion
to
the
future
commercial
current
passing
through
the
panama
canal
in
the
matter
of
the
claim
of
john
celestine
landreau
against
the
government
of
peru
which
claim
arises
out
of
certain
contracts
and
transactions
in
connection
with
the
discovery
and
exploitation
of
guano
and
which
has
been
under
discussion
between
the
two
governments
since
i
am
glad
to
report
that
as
the
result
of
prolonged
negotiations
which
have
been
characterized
by
the
utmost
friendliness
and
good
will
on
both
sides
the
department
of
state
has
succeeded
in
securing
the
consent
of
peru
to
the
arbitration
of
the
claim
and
that
the
negotiations
attending
the
drafting
and
signature
of
a
protocol
submitting
the
claim
to
an
arbitral
tribunal
are
proceeding
with
due
celerity
an
officer
of
the
american
public
health
service
and
an
american
sanitary
engineer
are
now
on
the
way
to
iquitos
in
the
employ
of
the
peruvian
government
to
take
charge
of
the
sanitation
of
that
river
port
peru
is
building
a
number
of
submarines
in
this
country
and
continues
to
show
every
desire
to
have
american
capital
invested
in
the
republic
in
july
the
united
states
sent
undergraduate
delegates
to
the
third
international
students
congress
held
at
lima
american
students
having
been
for
the
first
time
invited
to
one
of
these
meetings
the
republic
of
uruguay
has
shown
its
appreciation
of
american
agricultural
and
other
methods
by
sending
a
large
commission
to
this
country
and
by
employing
many
american
experts
to
assist
in
building
up
agricultural
and
allied
industries
in
uruguay
venezuela
is
paying
off
the
last
of
the
claims
the
settlement
of
which
was
provided
for
by
the
washington
protocols
including
those
of
american
citizens
our
relations
with
venezuela
are
most
cordial
and
the
trade
of
that
republic
with
the
united
states
is
now
greater
than
with
any
other
country
central
america
and
the
caribbean
during
the
past
summer
the
revolution
against
the
administration
which
followed
the
assassination
of
president
caceres
a
year
ago
last
november
brought
the
dominican
republic
to
the
verge
of
administrative
chaos
without
offering
any
guaranties
of
eventual
stability
in
the
ultimate
success
of
either
party
in
pursuance
of
the
treaty
relations
of
the
united
states
with
the
dominican
republic
which
were
threatened
by
the
necessity
of
suspending
the
operation
under
american
administration
of
the
customhouses
on
the
haitian
frontier
it
was
found
necessary
to
dispatch
special
commissioners
to
the
island
to
reestablish
the
customhouses
and
with
a
guard
sufficient
to
insure
needed
protection
to
the
customs
administration
the
efforts
which
have
been
made
appear
to
have
resulted
in
the
restoration
of
normal
conditions
throughout
the
republic
the
good
offices
which
the
commissioners
were
able
to
exercise
were
instrumental
in
bringing
the
contending
parties
together
and
in
furnishing
a
basis
of
adjustment
which
it
is
hoped
will
result
in
permanent
benefit
to
the
dominican
people
mindful
of
its
treaty
relations
and
owing
to
the
position
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
mediator
between
the
dominican
republic
and
haiti
in
their
boundary
dispute
and
because
of
the
further
fact
that
the
revolutionary
activities
on
the
haitiandominican
frontier
had
become
so
active
as
practically
to
obliterate
the
line
of
demarcation
that
had
been
heretofore
recognized
pending
the
definitive
settlement
of
the
boundary
in
controversy
it
was
found
necessary
to
indicate
to
the
two
island
governments
a
provisional
de
facto
boundary
line
this
was
done
without
prejudice
to
the
rights
or
obligations
of
either
country
in
a
final
settlement
to
be
reached
by
arbitration
the
tentative
line
chosen
was
one
which
under
the
circumstances
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
this
government
seemed
to
conform
to
the
best
interests
of
the
disputants
the
border
patrol
which
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
reestablish
for
customs
purposes
between
the
two
countries
was
instructed
provisionally
to
observe
this
line
the
republic
of
cuba
last
may
was
in
the
throes
of
a
lawless
uprising
that
for
a
time
threatened
the
destruction
of
a
great
deal
of
valuable
propertymuch
of
it
owned
by
americans
and
other
foreignersas
well
as
the
existence
of
the
government
itself
the
armed
forces
of
cuba
being
inadequate
to
guard
property
from
attack
and
at
the
same
time
properly
to
operate
against
the
rebels
a
force
of
american
marines
was
dispatched
from
our
naval
station
at
guantanamo
into
the
province
of
oriente
for
the
protection
of
american
and
other
foreign
life
and
property
the
cuban
government
was
thus
able
to
use
all
its
forces
in
putting
down
the
outbreak
which
it
succeeded
in
doing
in
a
period
of
six
weeks
the
presence
of
two
american
warships
in
the
harbor
of
habana
during
the
most
critical
period
of
this
disturbance
contributed
in
great
measure
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
inhabitants
including
a
large
foreign
colony
there
has
been
under
discussion
with
the
government
of
cuba
for
some
time
the
question
of
the
release
by
this
government
of
its
leasehold
rights
at
bahia
honda
on
the
northern
coast
of
cuba
and
the
enlargement
in
exchange
therefor
of
the
naval
station
which
has
been
established
at
guantanamo
bay
on
the
south
as
the
result
of
the
negotiations
thus
carried
on
an
agreement
has
been
reached
between
the
two
governments
providing
for
the
suitable
enlargement
of
the
guantanamo
bay
station
upon
terms
which
are
entirely
fair
and
equitable
to
all
parties
concerned
at
the
request
alike
of
the
government
and
both
political
parties
in
panama
an
american
commission
undertook
supervision
of
the
recent
presidential
election
in
that
republic
where
our
treaty
relations
and
indeed
every
geographical
consideration
make
the
maintenance
of
order
and
satisfactory
conditions
of
peculiar
interest
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
elections
passed
without
disorder
and
the
new
administration
has
entered
upon
its
functions
the
government
of
great
britain
has
asked
the
support
of
the
united
states
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
british
holders
of
the
foreign
bonded
debt
of
guatemala
while
this
government
is
hopeful
of
an
arrangement
equitable
to
the
british
bondholders
it
is
naturally
unable
to
view
the
question
apart
from
its
relation
to
the
broad
subject
of
financial
stability
in
central
america
in
which
the
policy
of
the
united
states
does
not
permit
it
to
escape
a
vital
interest
through
a
renewal
of
negotiations
between
the
government
of
guatemala
and
american
bankers
the
aim
of
which
is
a
loan
for
the
rehabilitation
of
guatemalan
finances
a
way
appears
to
be
open
by
which
the
government
of
guatemala
could
promptly
satisfy
any
equitable
and
just
british
claims
and
at
the
same
time
so
improve
its
whole
financial
position
as
to
contribute
greatly
to
the
increased
prosperity
of
the
republic
and
to
redound
to
the
benefit
of
foreign
investments
and
foreign
trade
with
that
country
failing
such
an
arrangement
it
may
become
impossible
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
escape
its
obligations
in
connection
with
such
measure
s
as
may
become
necessary
to
exact
justice
to
legitimate
foreign
claims
in
the
recent
revolution
in
nicaragua
which
it
was
generally
admitted
might
well
have
resulted
in
a
general
central
american
conflict
but
for
the
intervention
of
the
united
states
the
government
of
honduras
was
especially
menaced
but
fortunately
peaceful
conditions
were
maintained
within
the
borders
of
that
republic
the
financial
condition
of
that
country
remains
unchanged
no
means
having
been
found
for
the
final
adjustment
of
pressing
outstanding
foreign
claims
this
makes
it
the
more
regrettable
that
the
financial
convention
between
the
united
states
and
honduras
has
thus
far
failed
of
ratification
the
government
of
the
united
states
continues
to
hold
itself
ready
to
cooperate
with
the
government
of
honduras
which
it
is
believed
can
not
much
longer
delay
the
meeting
of
its
foreign
obligations
and
it
is
hoped
at
the
proper
time
american
bankers
will
be
willing
to
cooperate
for
this
purpose
necessity
for
greater
governmental
effort
in
retention
and
expansion
of
our
foreign
trade
it
is
not
possible
to
make
to
the
congress
a
communication
upon
the
present
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
so
detailed
as
to
convey
an
adequate
impression
of
the
enormous
increase
in
the
importance
and
activities
of
those
relations
if
this
government
is
really
to
preserve
to
the
american
people
that
free
opportunity
in
foreign
markets
which
will
soon
be
indispensable
to
our
prosperity
even
greater
efforts
must
be
made
otherwise
the
american
merchant
manufacturer
and
exporter
will
find
many
a
field
in
which
american
trade
should
logically
predominate
preempted
through
the
more
energetic
efforts
of
other
governments
and
other
commercial
nations
there
are
many
ways
in
which
through
hearty
cooperation
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
this
government
can
do
much
the
absolute
essential
is
the
spirit
of
united
effort
and
singleness
of
purpose
i
will
allude
only
to
a
very
few
specific
examples
of
action
which
ought
then
to
result
america
can
not
take
its
proper
place
in
the
most
important
fields
for
its
commercial
activity
and
enterprise
unless
we
have
a
merchant
marine
american
commerce
and
enterprise
can
not
be
effectively
fostered
in
those
fields
unless
we
have
good
american
banks
in
the
countries
referred
to
we
need
american
newspapers
in
those
countries
and
proper
means
for
public
information
about
them
we
need
to
assure
the
permanency
of
a
trained
foreign
service
we
need
legislation
enabling
the
members
of
the
foreign
service
to
be
systematically
brought
in
direct
contact
with
the
industrial
manufacturing
and
exporting
interests
of
this
country
in
order
that
american
business
men
may
enter
the
foreign
field
with
a
clear
perception
of
the
exact
conditions
to
be
dealt
with
and
the
officers
themselves
may
prosecute
their
work
with
a
clear
idea
of
what
american
industrial
and
manufacturing
interests
require
conclusion
congress
should
fully
realize
the
conditions
which
obtain
in
the
world
as
we
find
ourselves
at
the
threshold
of
our
middle
age
as
a
nation
we
have
emerged
full
grown
as
a
peer
in
the
great
concourse
of
nations
we
have
passed
through
various
formative
periods
we
have
been
selfcentered
in
the
struggle
to
develop
our
domestic
resources
and
deal
with
our
domestic
questions
the
nation
is
now
too
matured
to
continue
in
its
foreign
relations
those
temporary
expedients
natural
to
a
people
to
whom
domestic
affairs
are
the
sole
concern
in
the
past
our
diplomacy
has
often
consisted
in
normal
times
in
a
mere
assertion
of
the
right
to
international
existence
we
are
now
in
a
larger
relation
with
broader
rights
of
our
own
and
obligations
to
others
than
ourselves
a
number
of
great
guiding
principles
were
laid
down
early
in
the
history
of
this
government
the
recent
task
of
our
diplomacy
has
been
to
adjust
those
principles
to
the
conditions
of
today
to
develop
their
corollaries
to
find
practical
applications
of
the
old
principles
expanded
to
meet
new
situations
thus
are
being
evolved
bases
upon
which
can
rest
the
superstructure
of
policies
which
must
grow
with
the
destined
progress
of
this
nation
the
successful
conduct
of
our
foreign
relations
demands
a
broad
and
a
modern
view
we
can
not
meet
new
questions
nor
build
for
the
future
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
outworn
dogmas
of
the
past
and
to
the
perspective
appropriate
at
our
emergence
from
colonial
times
and
conditions
the
opening
of
the
panama
canal
will
mark
a
new
era
in
our
international
life
and
create
new
and
worldwide
conditions
which
with
their
vast
correlations
and
consequences
will
obtain
for
hundreds
of
years
to
come
we
must
not
wait
for
events
to
overtake
us
unawares
with
continuity
of
purpose
we
must
deal
with
the
problems
of
our
external
relations
by
a
diplomacy

resourceful
magnanimous
and
fittingly
expressive

the
high
ideals

more
space
than

have
therefore
adopted
the
course

sending
three

four
messages
during
the
first
ten
days
of
the
session

as
to
include

not

and
in
addition
we
have
a
cash
balance
in
the
treasury
as
a
general
fund
of
or
an
increase
of
over
the
general
fund
last
year
receipts
and
expenditures
for
three
years
the
expenditures
of
the
government
have
decreased
under
the
influence
of
an
effort
to
economize
this
year
presents
an
apparent
exception
the
estimate
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
ordinary
receipts
exclusive
of
postal
revenues
for
the
year
ending
june
indicates
that
they
will
amount
to
the
sum
of
the
estimates
of
the
expenditures
for
that
same
year
exclusive
of
panama
canal
disbursements
and
postal
disbursements
payable
from
postal
revenues
is
indicating
a
deficit
of
for
the
year
ending
june
similarly
estimated
receipts
were
while
the
total
corresponding
estimate
of
expenditures
for
that
year
submitted
through
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
congress
amounted
to
this
shows
an
increase
of
in
the
estimates
for
over
the
total
estimates
of
this
is
due
to
an
increase
of
in
the
estimate
for
rivers
and
harbors
for
the
next
year
on
projects
and
surveys
authorized
by
congress
to
an
increase
under
the
new
pension
bill
of
and
to
an
increase
in
the
estimates
for
expenses
of
the
navy
department
of
the
estimate
for
the
navy
department
for
the
year
included
two
battleships
congress
made
provision
for
only
one
battleship
and
therefore
the
navy
department
has
deemed
it
necessary
and
proper
to
make
an
estimate
which
includes
the
first
years
expenditure
for
three
battleships
in
addition
to
the
amount
required
for
work
on
the
uncompleted
ships
now
under
construction
in
addition
to
the
natural
increase
in
the
expenditures
for
the
uncompleted
ships
and
the
additional
battleship
estimated
for
the
other
increases
are
due
to
the
pay
required
for
or
more
additional
enlisted
men
in
the
navy
and
to
this
must
be
added
the
additional
cost
of
construction
imposed
by
the
change
in
the
eighthour
law
which
makes
it
applicable
to
ships
built
in
private
shipyards
with
the
exceptions
of
these
three
items
the
estimates
show
a
reduction
this
year
below
the
total
estimates
for
of
more
than
the
estimates
for
panama
canal
construction
for
are
less
than
for
our
banking
and
currency
system
a
time
when
panics
seem
far
removed
is
the
best
time
for
us
to
prepare
our
financial
system
to
withstand
a
storm
the
most
crying
need
this
country
has
is
a
proper
banking
and
currency
system
the
existing
one
is
inadequate
and
everyone
who
has
studied
the
question
admits
it
it
is
the
business
of
the
national
government
to
provide
a
medium
automatically
contracting
and
expanding
in
volume
to
meet
the
needs
of
trade
our
present
system

lacks
the
indispensable
quality
of
elasticity
the
only
part
of
our
monetary
medium
that
has
elasticity
is
the
banknote
currency
the
peculiar
provisions
of
the
law
requiring
national
banks
to
maintain
reserves
to
meet
the
call
of
the
depositors
operates
to
increase
the
money
stringency
when
it
arises
rather
than
to
expand
the
supply
of
currency
and
relieve
it
it
operates
upon
each
bank
and
furnishes
a
motive
for
the
withdrawal
of
currency
from
the
channels
of
trade
by
each
bank
to
save
itself
and
offers
no
inducement
whatever
for
the
use
of
the
reserve
to
expand
the
supply
of
currency
to
meet
the
exceptional
demand
after
the
panic
of
congress
realized
that
the
present
system
was
not
adapted
to
the
countrys
needs
and
that
under
it
panics
were
possible
that
might
properly
be
avoided
by
legislative
provision
accordingly
a
monetary
commission
was
appointed
which
made
a
report
in
february
the
system
which
they
recommended
involved
a
national
reserve
association
which
was
in
certain
of
its
faculties
and
functions
a
bank
and
which
was
given
through
its
governing
authorities
the
power
by
issuing
circulating
notes
for
approved
commercial
paper
by
fixing
discounts
and
by
other
methods
of
transfer
of
currency
to
expand
the
supply
of
the
monetary
medium
where
it
was
most
needed
to
prevent
the
export
or
hoarding
of
gold
and
generally
to
exercise
such
supervision
over
the
supply
of
money
in
every
part
of
the
country
as
to
prevent
a
stringency
and
a
panic
the
stock
in
this
association
was
to
be
distributed
to
the
banks
of
the
whole
united
states
state
and
national
in
a
mixed
proportion
to
bank
units
and
to
capital
stock
paid
in
the
control
of
the
association
was
vested
in
a
board
of
directors
to
be
elected
by
representatives
of
the
banks
except
certain
exofficio
directors
three
cabinet
officers
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
the
president
was
to
appoint
the
governor
of
the
association
from
three
persons
to
be
selected
by
the
directors
while
the
two
deputy
governors
were
to
be
elected
by
the
board
of
directors
the
details
of
the
plan
were
worked
out
with
great
care
and
ability
and
the
plan
in
general
seems
to
me
to
furnish
the
basis
for
a
proper
solution
of
our
present
difficulties
i
feel
that
the
government
might
very
properly
be
given
a
greater
voice
in
the
executive
committee
of
the
board
of
directors
without
danger
of
injecting
politics
into
its
management
but
i
think
the
federation
system
of
banks
is
a
good
one
provided
proper
precautions
are
taken
to
prevent
banks
of
large
capital
from
absorbing
power
through
ownership
of
stock
in
other
banks
the
objections
to
a
central
bank
it
seems
to
me
are
obviated
if
the
ownership
of
the
reserve
association
is
distributed
among
all
the
banks
of
a
country
in
which
banking
is
free
the
earnings
of
the
reserve
association
are
limited
in
percentage
tit
a
reasonable
and
fixed
amount
and
the
profits
over
and
above
this
are
to
be
turned
into
the
government
treasury
it
is
quite
probable
that
still
greater
security
against
control
by
money
centers
may
be
worked
into
the
plan
certain
it
is
however
that
the
objections
which
were
made
in
the
past
history
of
this
country
to
a
central
bank
as
furnishing
a
monopoly
of
financial
power
to
private
individuals
would
not
apply
to
an
association
whose
ownership
and
control
is
so
widely
distributed
and
is
divided
between
all
the
banks
of
the
country
state
and
national
on
the
one
hand
and
the
chief
executive
through
three
department
heads
and
his
comptroller
of
the
currency
on
the
other
the
ancient
hostility
to
a
national
bank
with
its
branches
in
which
is
concentrated
the
privilege
of
doing
a
banking
business
and
carrying
on
the
financial
transactions
of
the
government
has
prevented
the
establishment
of
such
a
bank
since
it
was
abolished
in
the
jackson
administration
our
present
national
banking
law
has
obviated
objections
growing
out
of
the
same
cause
by
providing
a
free
banking
system
in
which
any
set
of
stockholders
can
establish
a
national
bank
if
they
comply
with
the
conditions
of
law
it
seems
to
me
that
the
national
reserve
association
meets
the
same
objection
in
a
similar
way
that
is
by
giving
to
each
bank
state
and
national
in
accordance
with
its
size
a
certain
share
in
the
stock
of
the
reserve
association
nontransferable
and
only
to
be
held
by
the
bank
while
it
performs
its
functions
as
a
partner
in
the
reserve
association
the
report
of
the
commission
recommends
provisions
for
the
imposition
of
a
graduated
tax
on
the
expanded
currency
of
such
a
character
as
to
furnish
a
motive
for
reducing
the
issue
of
notes
whenever
their
presence
in
the
money
market
is
not
required
by
the
exigencies
of
trade
in
other
words
the
whole
system
has
been
worked
out
with
the
greatest
care
theoretically
it
presents
a
plan
that
ought
to
command
support
practically
it
may
require
modification
in
various
of
its
provisions
in
order
to
make
the
security
against
abuses
by
combinations
among
the
banks
impossible
but
in
the
face
of
the
crying
necessity
that
there
is
for
improvement
in
our
present
system
i
urgently
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
proposed
plan
and
the
report
of
the
commission
with
the
hope
that
an
earnest
consideration
may
suggest
amendments
and
changes
within
the
general
plan
which
will
lead
to
its
adoption
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
there
is
no
class
in
the
community
more
interested
in
a
safe
and
sane
banking
and
currency
system
one
which
will
prevent
panics
and
automatically
furnish
in
each
trade
center
the
currency
needed
in
the
carrying
on
of
the
business
at
that
center
than
the
wage
earner
there
is
no
class
in
the
community
whose
experience
better
qualifies
them
to
make
suggestions
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
a
currency
and
banking
system
than
the
bankers
and
business
men
ought
we
therefore
to
ignore
their
recommendations
and
reject
their
financial
judgment
as
to
the
proper
method
of
reforming
our
financial
system
merely
because
of
the
suspicion
which
exists
against
them
in
the
minds
of
many
of
our
fellow
citizens
is
it
not
the
duty
of
congress
to
take
up
the
plan
suggested
examine
it
from
all
standpoints
give
impartial
consideration
to
the
testimony
of
those
whose
experience
ought
to
fit
them
to
give
the
best
advice
on
the
subject
and
then
to
adopt
some
plan
which
will
secure
the
benefits
desired
a
banking
and
currency
system
seems
far
away
from
the
wage
earner
and
the
farmer
but
the
fact
is
that
they
are
vitally
interested
in
a
safe
system
of
currency
which
shall
graduate
its
volume
to
the
amount
needed
and
which
shall
prevent
times
of
artificial
stringency
that
frighten
capital
stop
employment
prevent
the
meeting
of
the
pay
roll
destroy
local
markets
and
produce
penury
and
want
the
tariff
i
have
regarded
it
as
my
duty
in
former
messages
to
the
congress
to
urge
the
revision
of
the
tariff
upon
principles
of
protection
it
was
my
judgment
that
the
customs
duties
ought
to
be
revised
downward
but
that
the
reduction
ought
not
to
be
below
a
rate
which
would
represent
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
production
between
the
article
in
question
at
home
and
abroad
and
for
this
and
other
reasons
i
vetoed
several
bills
which
were
presented
to
me
in
the
last
session
of
this
congress
now
that
a
new
congress
has
been
elected
on
a
platform
of
a
tariff
for
revenue
only
rather
than
a
protective
tariff
and
is
to
revise
the
tariff
on
that
basis
it
is
needless
for
me
to
occupy
the
time
of
this
congress
with
arguments
or
recommendations
in
favor
of
a
protective
tariff
before
passing
from
the
tariff
law
however
known
as
the
payne
tariff
law
of
august
i
desire
to
call
attention
to
section
of
that
act
assessing
a
special
excise
tax
on
corporations
it
contains
a
provision
requiring
the
levy
of
an
additional
per
cent
to
the
annual
tax
in
cases
of
neglect
to
verify
the
prescribed
return
or
to
file
it
before
the
time
required
by
law
this
additional
charge
of
per
cent
operates
in
some
cases
as
a
harsh
penalty
for
what
may
have
been
a
mere
inadvertence
or
unintentional
oversight
and
the
law
should
be
so
amended
as
to
mitigate
the
severity
of
the
charge
in
such
instances
provision
should
also
be
made
for
the
refund
of
additional
taxes
heretofore
collected
because
of
such
infractions
in
those
cases
where
the
penalty
imposed
has
been
so
disproportionate
to
the
offense
as
equitably
to
demand
relief
budget
the
estimates
for
the
next
fiscal
year
have
been
assembled
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
by
him
transmitted
to
congress
i
purpose
at
a
later
day
to
submit
to
congress
a
form
of
budget
prepared
for
me
and
recommended
by
the
presidents
commission
on
economy
and
efficiency
with
a
view
of
suggesting
the
useful
and
informing
character
of
a
properly
framed
budget
war
department
the
war
department
combines
within
its
jurisdiction
functions
which
in
other
countries
usually
occupy
three
departments
it
not
only
has
the
management
of
the
army
and
the
coast
defenses
but
its
jurisdiction
extends
to
the
government
of
the
philippines
and
of
porto
rico
and
the
control
of
the
receivership
of
the
customs
revenues
of
the
dominican
republic
it
also
includes
the
recommendation
of
all
plans
for
the
improvement
of
harbors
and
waterways
and
their
execution
when
adopted
and
by
virtue
of
an
executive
order
the
supervision
of
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
army
reorganization
our
small
army
now
consists
of
men
excluding
the
philippine
scouts
leaving
out
of
consideration
the
coast
artillery
force
whose
position
is
fixed
in
our
various
seacoast
defenses
and
the
present
garrisons
of
our
various
insular
possessions
we
have
today
within
the
continental
united
states
a
mobile
army
of
only
about
men
this
little
force
must
be
still
further
drawn
upon
to
supply
the
new
garrisons
for
the
great
naval
base
which
is
being
established
at
pearl
harbor
in
the
hawaiian
islands
and
to
protect
the
locks
now
rapidly
approaching
completion
at
panama
the
forces
remaining
in
the
united
states
are
now
scattered
in
nearly
posts
situated
for
a
variety
of
historical
reasons
in
states
these
posts
contain
only
fracti
ons
of
regiments
averaging
less
than
men
each
in
time
of
peace
it
has
been
our
historical
policy
to
administer
these
units
separately
by
a
geographical
organization
in
other
words
our
army
in
time
of
peace
has
never
been
a
united
organization
but
merely
scattered
groups
of
companies
battalions
and
regiments
and
the
first
task
in
time
of
war
has
been
to
create
out
of
these
scattered
units
an
army
fit
for
effective
teamwork
and
cooperation
to
the
task
of
meeting
these
patent
defects
the
war
department
has
been
addressing
itself
during
the
past
year
for
many
years
we
had
no
officer
or
division
whose
business
it
was
to
study
these
problems
and
plan
remedies
for
these
defects
with
the
establishment
of
the
general
staff
nine
years
ago
a
body
was
created
for
this
purpose
it
has
necessarily
required
time
to
overcome
even
in
its
own
personnel
the
habits
of
mind
engendered
by
a
century
of
lack
of
method
but
of
late
years
its
work
has
become
systematic
and
effective
and
it
has
recently
been
addressing
itself
vigorously
to
these
problems
a
comprehensive
plan
of
army
reorganization
was
prepared
by
the
war
college
division
of
the
general
staff
this
plan
was
thoroughly
discussed
last
summer
at
a
series
of
open
conferences
held
by
the
secretary
of
war
and
attended
by
representatives
from
all
branches
of
the
army
and
from
congress
in
printed
form
it
has
been
distributed
to
members
of
congress
and
throughout
the
army
and
the
national
guard
and
widely
through
institutions
of
learning
and
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
in
it
for
the
first
time
we
have
a
tentative
chart
for
future
progress
under
the
influence
of
this
study
definite
and
effective
steps
have
been
taken
toward
army
reorganization
so
far
as
such
reorganization
lies
within
the
executive
power
hitherto
there
has
been
no
difference
of
policy
in
the
treatment
of
the
organization
of
our
foreign
garrisons
from
those
of
troops
within
the
united
states
the
difference
of
situation
is
vital
and
the
foreign
garrison
should
be
prepared
to
defend
itself
at
an
instants
notice
against
a
foe
who
may
command
the
sea
unlike
the
troops
in
the
united
states
it
can
not
count
upon
reinforcements
or
recruitment
it
is
an
outpost
upon
which
will
fall
the
brunt
of
the
first
attack
in
case
of
war
the
historical
policy
of
the
united
states
of
carrying
its
regiments
during
time
of
peace
at
half
strength
has
no
application
to
our
foreign
garrisons
during
the
past
year
this
defect
has
been
remedied
as
to
the
philippines
garrison
the
former
garrison
of
reduced
regiments
has
been
replaced
by
a
garrison
of
regiments
at
full
strength
giving
fully
the
same
number
of
riflemen
at
an
estimated
economy
in
cost
of
maintenance
of
over
per
year
this
garrison
is
to
be
permanent
its
regimental
units
instead
of
being
transferred
periodically
back
and
forth
from
the
united
states
will
remain
in
the
islands
the
officers
and
men
composing
these
units
will
however
serve
a
regular
tropical
detail
as
usual
thus
involving
no
greater
hardship
upon
the
personnel
and
greatly
increasing
the
effectiveness
of
the
garrison
a
similar
policy
is
proposed
for
the
hawaiian
and
panama
garrisons
as
fast
as
the
barracks
for
them
are
completed
i
strongly
urge
upon
congress
that
the
necessary
appropriations
for
this
purpose
should
be
promptly
made
it
is
in
my
opinion
of
first
importance
that
these
national
outposts
upon
which
a
successful
home
defense
will
primarily
depend
should
be
finished
and
placed
in
effective
condition
at
the
earliest
possible
day
the
home
army
simultaneously
with
the
foregoing
steps
the
war
department
has
been
proceeding
with
the
reorganization
of
the
army
at
home
the
formerly
disassociated
units
are
being
united
into
a
tactical
organization
of
three
divisions
each
consisting
of
two
or
three
brigades
of
infantry
and
so
far
as
practicable
a
proper
proportion
of
divisional
cavalry
and
artillery
of
course
the
extent
to
which
this
reform
can
be
carried
by
the
executive
is
practically
limited
to
a
paper
organization
the
scattered
units
can
be
brought
under
a
proper
organization
but
they
will
remain
physically
scattered
until
congress
supplies
the
necessary
funds
for
grouping
them
in
more
concentrated
posts
until
that
is
done
the
present
difficulty
of
drilling
our
scattered
groups
together
and
thus
training
them
for
the
proper
team
play
can
not
be
removed
but
we
shall
at
least
have
an
army
which
will
know
its
own
organization
and
will
be
inspected
by
its
proper
commanders
and
to
which
as
a
unit
emergency
orders
can
be
issued
in
time
of
war
or
other
emergency
moreover
the
organization
which
in
many
respects
is
necessarily
a
skeleton
will
furnish
a
guide
for
future
development
the
separate
regiments
and
companies
will
know
the
brigades
and
divisions
to
which
they
belong
they
will
be
maneuvered
together
whenever
maneuvers
are
established
by
congress
and
the
gaps
in
their
organization
will
show
the
pattern
into
which
can
be
filled
new
troops
as
the
nation
grows
and
a
larger
army
is
provided
regular
army
reserve
one
of
the
most
important
reforms
accomplished
during
the
past
year
has
been
the
legislation
enacted
in
the
army
appropriation
bill
of
last
summer
providing
for
a
regular
army
reserve
hitherto
our
national
policy
has
assumed
that
at
the
outbreak
of
war
our
regiments
would
be
immediately
raised
to
full
strength
but
our
laws
have
provided
no
means
by
which
this
could
be
accomplished
or
by
which
the
losses
of
the
regiments
when
once
sent
to
the
front
could
be
repaired
in
this
respect
we
have
neglected
the
lessons
learned
by
other
nations
the
new
law
provides
that
the
soldier
after
serving
four
years
with
colors
shall
pass
into
a
reserve
for
three
years
at
his
option
he
may
go
into
the
reserve
at
the
end
of
three
years
remaining
there
for
four
years
while
in
the
reserve
he
can
be
called
to
active
duty
only
in
case
of
war
or
other
national
emergency
and
when
so
called
and
only
in
such
case
will
receive
a
stated
amount
of
pay
for
all
of
the
period
in
which
he
has
been
a
member
of
the
reserve
the
legislation
is
imperfect
in
my
opinion
in
certain
particulars
but
it
is
a
most
important
step
in
the
right
direction
and
i
earnestly
hope
that
it
will
be
carefully
studied
and
perfected
by
congress
the
national
guard
under
existing
law
the
national
guard
constitutes
after
the
regular
army
the
first
line
of
national
defense
its
organization
discipline
training
and
equipment
under
recent
legislation
have
been
assimilated
as
far
as
possible
to
those
of
the
regular
army
and
its
practical
efficiency
under
the
effect
of
this
training
has
very
greatly
increased
our
citizen
soldiers
under
present
conditions
have
reached
a
stage
of
development
beyond
which
they
can
not
reasonably
be
asked
to
go
without
further
direct
assistance
in
the
form
of
pay
from
the
federal
government
on
the
other
hand
such
pay
from
the
national
treasury
would
not
be
justified
unless
it
produced
a
proper
equivalent
in
additional
efficiency
on
the
part
of
the
national
guard
the
organized
militia
today
can
not
be
ordered
outside
of
the
limits
of
the
united
states
and
thus
can
not
lawfully
be
used
for
general
military
purposes
the
officers
and
men
are
ambitious
and
eager
to
make
themselves
thus
available
and
to
become
an
efficient
national
reserve
of
citizen
soldiery
they
are
the
only
force
of
trained
men
other
than
the
regular
army
upon
which
we
can
rely
the
socalled
militia
pay
bill
in
the
form
agreed
on
between
the
authorities
of
the
war
department
and
the
representatives
of
the
national
guard
in
my
opinion
adequately
meets
these
conditions
and
offers
a
proper
return
for
the
pay
which
it
is
proposed
to
give
to
the
national
guard
i
believe
that
its
enactment
into
law
would
be
a
very
long
step
toward
providing
this
nation
with
a
first
line
of
citizen
soldiery
upon
which
its
main
reliance
must
depend
in
case
of
any
national
emergency
plans
for
the
organization
of
the
national
guard
into
tactical
divisions
on
the
same
lines
as
those
adopted
for
the
regular
army
are
being
formulated
by
the
war
college
division
of
the
general
staff
national
volunteers
the
national
guard
consists
of
only
about
men
in
any
serious
war
in
the
past
it
has
always
been
necessary
and
in
such
a
war
in
the
future
it
doubtless
will
be
necessary
for
the
nation
to
depend
in
addition
to
the
regular
army
and
the
national
guard
upon
a
large
force
of
volunteers
there
is
at
present
no
adequate
provision
of
law
for
the
raising
of
such
a
force
there
is
now
pending
in
congress
however
a
bill
which
makes
such
provision
and
which
i
believe
is
admirably
adapted
to
meet
the
exigencies
which
would
be
presented
in
case
of
war
the
passage
of
the
bill
would
not
entail
a
dollars
expense
upon
the
government
at
this
time
or
in
the
future
until
war
comes
but
if
war
comes
the
methods
therein
directed
are
in
accordance
with
the
best
military
judgment
as
to
what
they
ought
to
be
and
the
act
would
prevent
the
necessity
for
a
discussion
of
any
legislation
and
the
delays
incident
to
its
consideration
and
adoption
i
earnestly
urge
its
passage
consolidation
of
the
supply
corps
the
army
appropriation
act
of
also
carried
legislation
for
the
consolidation
of
the
quartermasters
department
the
subsistence
department
and
the
pay
corps
into
a
single
supply
department
to
be
known
as
the
quartermasters
corps
it
also
provided
for
the
organization
of
a
special
force
of
enlisted
men
to
be
known
as
the
service
corps
gradually
to
replace
many
of
the
civilian
employees
engaged
in
the
manual
labor
necessary
in
every
army
i
believe
that
both
of
these
enactments
will
improve
the
administration
of
our
military
establishment
the
consolidation
of
the
supply
corps
has
already
been
effected
and
the
organization
of
the
service
corps
is
being
put
into
effect
all
of
the
foregoing
reforms
are
in
the
direction
of
economy
and
efficiency
except
for
the
slight
increase
necessary
to
garrison
our
outposts
in
hawaii
and
panama
they
do
not
call
for
a
larger
army
but
they
do
tend
to
produce
a
much
more
efficient
one
the
only
substantial
new
appropriations
require
d
are
those
which
as
i
have
pointed
out
are
necessary
to
complete
the
fortifications
and
barracks
at
our
naval
bases
and
outposts
beyond
the
sea
porto
rico
porto
rico
continues
to
show
notable
progress
both
commercially
and
in
the
spread
of
education
its
external
commerce
has
increased
per
cent
over
the
preceding
year
bringing
the
total
value
up
to
or
more
than
five
times
the
value
of
the
commerce
of
the
island
in
during
the
year
pupils
were
enrolled
in
the
public
schools
as
against
for
the
preceding
year
and
as
compared
with
for
the
first
year
of
american
administration
special
efforts
are
under
way
for
the
promotion
of
vocational
and
industrial
training
the
need
of
which
is
particularly
pressing
in
the
island
when
the
bubonic
plague
broke
out
last
june
the
quick
and
efficient
response
of
the
people
of
porto
rico
to
the
demands
of
modern
sanitation
was
strikingly
shown
by
the
thorough
campaign
which
was
instituted
against
the
plague
and
the
hearty
public
opinion
which
supported
the
governments
efforts
to
check
its
progress
and
to
prevent
its
recurrence
the
failure
thus
far
to
grant
american
citizenship
continues
to
be
the
only
ground
of
dissatisfaction
the
bill
conferring
such
citizenship
has
passed
the
house
of
representatives
and
is
now
awaiting
the
action
of
the
senate
i
am
heartily
in
favor
of
the
passage
of
this
bill
i
believe
that
the
demand
for
citizenship
is
just
and
that
it
is
amply
earned
by
sustained
loyalty
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
demand
must
be
and
in
the
minds
of
most
porto
ricans
is
entirely
disassociated
from
any
thought
of
statehood
i
believe
that
no
substantial
approved
public
opinion
in
the
united
states
or
in
porto
rico
contemplates
statehood
for
the
island
as
the
ultimate
form
of
relations
between
us
i
believe
that
the
aim
to
be
striven
for
is
the
fullest
possible
allowance
of
legal
and
fiscal
selfgovernment
with
american
citizenship
as
to
the
bond
between
us
in
other
words
a
relation
analogous
to
the
present
relation
between
great
britain
and
such
selfgoverning
colonies
as
canada
and
australia
this
would
conduce
to
the
fullest
and
most
selfsustaining
development
of
porto
rico
while
at
the
same
time
it
would
grant
her
the
economic
and
political
benefits
of
being
under
the
american
flag
philippines
a
bill
is
pending
in
congress
which
revolutionizes
the
carefully
worked
out
scheme
of
government
under
which
the
philippine
islands
are
now
governed
and
which
proposes
to
render
them
virtually
autonomous
at
once
and
absolutely
independent
in
eight
years
such
a
proposal
can
only
be
founded
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
now
discharged
our
trusteeship
to
the
filipino
people
and
our
responsibility
for
them
to
the
world
and
that
they
are
now
prepared
for
selfgovernment
as
well
as
national
sovereignty
a
thorough
and
unbiased
knowledge
of
the
facts
clearly
shows
that
these
assumptions
are
absolutely
without
justification
as
to
this
i
believe
that
there
is
no
substantial
difference
of
opinion
among
any
of
those
who
have
had
the
responsibility
of
facing
philippine
problems
in
the
administration
of
the
islands
and
i
believe
that
no
one
to
whom
the
future
of
this
people
is
a
responsible
concern
can
countenance
a
policy
fraught
with
the
direst
consequences
to
those
on
whose
behalf
it
is
ostensibly
urged
in
the
philippine
islands
we
have
embarked
upon
an
experiment
unprecedented
in
dealing
with
dependent
people
we
are
developing
there
conditions
exclusively
for
their
own
welfare
we
found
an
archipelago
containing
tribes
and
races
speaking
a
great
variety
of
languages
and
with
a
population
over
per
cent
of
which
could
neither
read
nor
write
through
the
unifying
forces
of
a
common
education
of
commercial
and
economic
development
and
of
gradual
participation
in
local
selfgovernment
we
are
endeavoring
to
evolve
a
homogeneous
people
fit
to
determine
when
the
time
arrives
their
own
destiny
we
are
seeking
to
arouse
a
national
spirit
and
not
as
under
the
older
colonial
theory
to
suppress
such
a
spirit
the
character
of
the
work
we
have
been
doing
is
keenly
recognized
in
the
orient
and
our
success
thus
far
followed
with
not
a
little
envy
by
those
who
initiating
the
same
policy
find
themselves
hampered
by
conditions
grown
up
in
earlier
days
and
under
different
theories
of
administration
but
our
work
is
far
from
done
our
duty
to
the
filipinos
is
far
from
discharged
over
half
a
million
filipino
students
are
now
in
the
philippine
schools
helping
to
mold
the
men
of
the
future
into
a
homogeneous
people
but
there
still
remain
more
than
a
million
filipino
children
of
school
age
yet
to
be
reached
freed
from
american
control
the
integrating
forces
of
a
common
education
and
a
common
language
will
cease
and
the
educational
system
now
well
started
will
slip
back
into
inefficiency
and
disorder
an
enormous
increase
in
the
commercial
development
of
the
islands
has
been
made
since
they
were
virtually
granted
full
access
to
our
markets
three
years
ago
with
every
prospect
of
increasing
development
and
diversified
industries
freed
from
american
control
such
development
is
bound
to
decline
every
observer
speaks
of
the
great
progress
in
public
works
for
the
benefit
of
the
filipinos
of
harbor
improvements
of
roads
and
railways
of
irrigation
and
artesian
wells
public
buildings
and
better
means
of
communication
but
large
parts
of
the
islands
are
still
unreached
still
even
unexplored
roads
and
railways
are
needed
in
many
parts
irrigation
systems
are
still
to
be
installed
and
wells
to
be
driven
whole
villages
and
towns
are
still
without
means
of
communication
other
than
almost
impassable
roads
and
trails
even
the
great
progress
in
sanitation
which
has
successfully
suppressed
smallpox
the
bubonic
plague
and
asiatic
cholera
has
found
the
cause
of
and
a
cure
for
beriberi
has
segregated
the
lepers
has
helped
to
make
manila
the
most
healthful
city
in
the
orient
and
to
free
life
throughout
the
whole
archipelago
from
its
former
dread
diseases
is
nevertheless
incomplete
in
many
essentials
of
permanence
in
sanitary
policy
even
more
remains
to
be
accomplished
if
freed
from
american
control
sanitary
progress
is
bound
to
be
arrested
and
all
that
has
been
achieved
likely
to
be
lost
concurrent
with
the
economic
social
and
industrial
development
of
the
islands
has
been
the
development
of
the
political
capacity
of
the
people
by
their
progressive
participation
in
government
the
filipinos
are
being
steadily
and
hopefully
trained
for
selfgovernment
under
spanish
control
they
shared
in
no
way
in
the
government
under
american
control
they
have
shared
largely
and
increasingly
within
the
last
dozen
years
they
have
gradually
been
given
complete
autonomy
in
the
municipalities
the
right
to
elect
twothirds
of
the
provincial
governing
boards
and
the
lower
house
of
the
insular
legislature
they
have
four
native
members
out
of
nine
members
of
the
commission
or
upper
house
the
chief
justice
and
two
justices
of
the
supreme
court
about
onehalf
of
the
higher
judicial
positions
and
all
of
the
justices
of
the
peach
are
natives
in
the
classified
civil
service
the
proportion
of
filipinos
increased
from
per
cent
in
to
per
cent
in
thus
today
all
the
municipal
employees
over
go
per
cent
of
the
provincial
employees
and
per
cent
of
the
officials
and
employees
of
the
central
government
are
filipinos
the
ideal
which
has
been
kept
in
mind
in
our
political
guidance
of
the
islands
has
been
real
popular
selfgovernment
and
not
mere
paper
independence
i
am
happy
to
say
that
the
filipinos
have
done
well
enough
in
the
places
they
have
filled
and
in
the
discharge
of
the
political
power
with
which
they
have
been
intrusted
to
warrant
the
belief
that
they
can
be
educated
and
trained
to
complete
selfgovernment
but
the
present
satisfactory
results
are
due
to
constant
support
and
supervision
at
every
step
by
americans
if
the
task
we
have
undertaken
is
higher
than
that
assumed
by
other
nations
its
accomplishment
must
demand
even
more
patience
we
must
not
forget
that
we
found
the
filipinos
wholly
untrained
in
government
up
to
our
advent
all
other
experience
sought
to
repress
rather
than
encourage
political
power
it
takes
long
time
and
much
experience
to
ingrain
political
habits
of
steadiness
and
efficiency
popular
selfgovernment
ultimately
must
rest
upon
common
habits
of
thought
and
upon
a
reasonably
developed
public
opinion
no
such
foundations
for
selfgovernment
let
alone
independence
are
now
present
in
the
philippine
islands
disregarding
even
their
racial
heterogeneity
and
the
lack
of
ability
to
think
as
a
nation
it
is
sufficient
to
point
out
that
under
liberal
franchise
privileges
only
about
per
cent
of
the
filipinos
vote
and
only
per
cent
of
the
people
are
said
to
read
the
public
press
to
confer
independence
upon
the
filipinos
now
is
therefore
to
subject
the
great
mass
of
their
people
to
the
dominance
of
an
oligarchical
and
probably
exploiting
minority
such
a
course
will
be
as
cruel
to
those
people
as
it
would
be
shameful
to
us
our
true
course
is
to
pursue
steadily
and
courageously
the
path
we
have
thus
far
followed
to
guide
the
filipinos
into
selfsustaining
pursuits
to
continue
the
cultivation
of
sound
political
habits
through
education
and
political
practice
to
encourage
the
diversification
of
industries
and
to
realize
the
advantages
of
their
industrial
education
by
conservatively
approved
cooperative
methods
at
once
checking
the
dangers
of
concentrated
wealth
and
building
up
a
sturdy
independent
citizenship
we
should
do
all
this
with
a
disinterested
endeavor
to
secure
for
the
filipinos
economic
independence
and
to
fit
them
for
complete
selfgovernment
with
the
power
to
decide
eventually
according
to
their
own
largest
good
whether
such
selfgovernment
shall
be
accompanied
by
independence
a
present
declaration
even
of
future
independence
would
retard
progress
by
the
dissension
and
disorder
it
would
arouse
on
our
part
it
would
be
a
disingenuous
attempt
under
the
guise
of
conferring
a
benefit
on
them
to
relieve
ourselves
from
the
heavy
and
diffi
cult
burden
which
thus
far
we
have
been
bravely
and
consistently
sustaining
it
would
be
a
disguised
policy
of
scuttle
it
would
make
the
helpless
filipino
the
football
of
oriental
politics
tinder
the
protection
of
a
guaranty
of
their
independence
which
we
would
be
powerless
to
enforce
regulation
of
water
power
there
are
pending
before
congress
a
large
number
of
bills
proposing
to
grant
privileges
of
erecting
dams
for
the
purpose
of
creating
water
power
in
our
navigable
rivers
the
pendency
of
these
bills
has
brought
out
an
important
defect
in
the
existing
general
dam
act
that
act
does
not
in
my
opinion
grant
sufficient
power
to
the
federal
government
in
dealing
with
the
construction
of
such
dams
to
exact
protective
conditions
in
the
interest
of
navigation
it
does
not
permit
the
federal
government
as
a
condition
of
its
permit
to
require
that
a
part
of
the
value
thus
created
shall
be
applied
to
the
further
general
improvement
and
protection
of
the
stream
i
believe
this
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
matters
of
internal
improvement
now
confronting
the
government
most
of
the
navigable
rivers
of
this
country
are
comparatively
long
and
shallow
in
order
that
they
may
be
made
fully
useful
for
navigation
there
has
come
into
vogue
a
method
of
improvement
known
as
canalization
or
the
slackwater
method
which
consists
in
building
a
series
of
dams
and
locks
each
of
which
will
create
a
long
pool
of
deep
navigable
water
at
each
of
these
dams
there
is
usually
created
also
water
power
of
commercial
value
if
the
water
power
thus
created
can
be
made
available
for
the
further
improvement
of
navigation
in
the
stream
it
is
manifest
that
the
improvement
will
be
much
more
quickly
effected
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
that
the
burden
on
the
general
taxpayers
of
the
country
will
be
very
much
reduced
private
interests
seeking
permits
to
build
waterpower
dams
in
navigable
streams
usually
urge
that
they
thus
improve
navigation
and
that
if
they
do
not
impair
navigation
they
should
be
allowed
to
take
for
themselves
the
entire
profits
of
the
waterpower
development
whatever
they
may
do
by
way
of
relieving
the
government
of
the
expense
of
improving
navigation
should
be
given
due
consideration
but
it
must
be
apparent
that
there
may
be
a
profit
beyond
a
reasonably
liberal
return
upon
the
private
investment
which
is
a
potential
asset
of
the
government
in
carrying
out
a
comprehensive
policy
of
waterway
development
it
is
no
objection
to
the
retention
and
use
of
such
an
asset
by
the
government
that
a
comprehensive
waterway
policy
will
include
the
protection
and
development
of
the
other
public
uses
of
water
which
can
not
and
should
not
be
ignored
in
making
and
executing
plans
for
the
protection
and
development
of
navigation
it
is
also
equally
clear
that
inasmuch
as
the
water
power
thus
created
is
or
may
be
an
incident
of
a
general
scheme
of
waterway
improvement
within
the
constitutional
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
the
regulation
of
such
water
power
lies
also
within
that
jurisdiction
in
my
opinion
constructive
statesmanship
requires
that
legislation
should
be
enacted
which
will
permit
the
development
of
navigation
in
these
great
rivers
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
utilization
of
this
byproduct
of
water
power
created
in
the
course
of
the
same
improvement
and
that
the
general
dam
act
should
be
so
amended
as
to
make
this
possible
i
deem
it
highly
important
that
the
nation
should
adopt
a
consistent
and
harmonious
treatment
of
these
waterpower
projects
which
will
preserve
for
this
purpose
their
value
to
the
government
whose
right
it
is
to
grant
the
permit
any
other
policy
is
equivalent
to
throwing
away
a
most
valuable
national
asset
the
panama
canal
during
the
past
year
the
work
of
construction
upon
the
canal
has
progressed
most
satisfactorily
about
per
cent
of
the
excavation
work
has
been
completed
and
more
than
per
cent
of
the
concrete
for
all
the
locks
is
in
place
in
view
of
the
great
interest
which
has
been
manifested
as
to
some
slides
in
the
culebra
cut
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
report
of
col
goethals
should
allay
any
apprehension
on
this
point
it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
none
of
the
slides
which
occurred
during
this
year
would
have
interfered
with
the
passage
of
the
ships
had
the
canal
in
fact
been
in
operation
and
when
the
slope
pressures
will
have
been
finally
adjusted
and
the
growth
of
vegetation
will
minimize
erosion
in
the
banks
of
the
cut
the
slide
problem
will
be
practically
solved
and
an
ample
stability
assured
for
the
culebra
cut
although
the
official
date
of
the
opening
has
been
set
for
january
the
canal
will
in
fact
from
present
indications
be
opened
for
shipping
during
the
latter
half
of
no
fixed
date
can
as
yet
be
set
but
shipping
interests
will
be
advised
as
soon
as
assurances
can
be
given
that
vessels
can
pass
through
without
unnecessary
delay

has
made
admirable
provisions
for

responsibility
in

the
problem

that

the

is
in
accord
with
the
panama

act
passed
by

we
have
been
advised
that
the
british

has
prepared

urge
that

be
made

order
that

may

as
the
wonderful
executive
work
of
col
goethals
becomes
more
conspicuous
in
the
eyes
of
the
country
and
of
the
world
it
seems
to
me
wise
and
proper
to
make
provision
by
law
for
such
reward
to
him
as
may
be
commensurate
with
the
service
that
he
has
rendered
to
his
country
i
suggest
that
this
reward
take
the
form
of
an
appointment
of
col
goethals
as
a
major
general
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
law
authorizing
such
appointment
be
accompanied
with
a
provision
permitting
his
designation
as
chief
of
engineers
upon
the
retirement
of
the
present
incumbent
of
that
office
navy
department
the
navy
of
the
united
states
is
in
a
greater
state
of
efficiency
and
is
more
powerful
than
it
has
ever
been
before
but
in
the
emulation
which
exists
between
different
countries
in
respect
to
the
increase
of
naval
and
military
armaments
this
condition
is
not
a
permanent
one
in
view
of
the
many
improvements
and
increases
by
foreign
governments
the
slightest
halt
on
our
part
in
respect
to
new
construction
throws
us
back
and
reduces
us
from
a
naval
power
of
the
first
rank
and
places
us
among
the
nations
of
the
second
rank
in
the
past
years
the
navy
has
expanded
rapidly
and
yet
far
less
rapidly
than
our
country
from
now
on
reduced

means
reduced

strength
the
worlds
history
has
shown
the
importance
of
sea
power
both
for
adequate
defense
and
for
the
support
of
important
and
definite
policies
i
had
the
pleasure
of
attending
this
autumn
a
mobilization
of
the
atlantic
fleet
and
was
glad
to
observe
and
note
the
preparedness
of
the
fleet
for
instant
action
the
review
brought
before
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
a
greater
and
more
powerful
collection
of
vessels
than
had
ever
been
gathered
in
american
waters
the
condition
of
the
fleet
and
of
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
and
of
the
equipment
of
the
vessels
entitled
those
in
authority
to
the
greatest
credit
i
again
commend
to
congress
the
giving
of
legislative
sanction
to
the
appointment
of
the
naval
aids
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
these
aids
and
the
council
of
aids
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
assist
him
in
the
conduct
of
his
department
have
proven
to
be
of
the
highest
utility
they
have
furnished
an
executive
committee
of
the
most
skilled
naval
experts
who
have
coordinated
the
action
of
the
various
bureaus
in
the
navy
and
by
their
advice
have
enabled
the
secretary
to
give
an
administration
at
the
same
time
economical
and
most
efficient
never
before
has
the
united
states
had
a
navy
that
compared
in
efficiency
with
its
present
one
but
never
before
have
the
requirements
with
respect
to
naval

warfare
been
higher
and
more
exacting
than
now
a
year
ago
congress
refused
to
appropriate
for
more
than
one
battleship
in
this
i
think
a
great
mistake
of
policy
was
made
and
i
urgently
recommend
that
this
congress
make
up
for
the
mistake
of
the
last
session
by
appropriations
authorizing
the
construction
of
three
battleships
in
addition
to
destroyers
fuel
ships
and
the
other
auxiliary
vessels
as
shown
in
the
building
program
of
the
general
board
we
are
confronted
by
a
condition
in
respect
to
the
navies
of
the
world
which
requires
us
if
we
would
maintain
our
navy
as
an
insurance
of
peace
to
augment
our
naval
force
by
at
least
two
battleships
a
year
and
by
battle
cruisers
gunboats
torpedo
destroyers
and
submarine
boats
in
a
proper
proportion
we
have
no
desire
for
war
we
would
go
as
far
as
any
nation
in
the
world
to
avoid
war
but
we
are
a
world
power
our
population
our
wealth
our
definite
policies
our
responsibilities
in
the
pacific
and
the
atlantic
our
defense
of
the
panama
canal
together
with
our
enormous
world
trade
and
our
missionary
outposts
on
the
frontiers
of
civilization
require
us
to
recognize
our
position
as
one
of
the
foremost
in
the
family
of
nations
and
to
clothe
ourselves
with
sufficient
naval
power
to
give
force
to
our
reasonable
demands
and
to
give
weight
to
our
influence
in
those
directions
of
progress
that
a
powerful
christian
nation
should
advocate
i
observe
that
the
secretary
of
the
navy
devotes
some
space
to
a
change
in
the
disciplinary
system
in
vogue
in
that
branch
of
the
service
i
think
there
is
nothing
quite
so
unsatisfactory
to
either
the
army
or
the
navy
as
the
severe
punishments
necessarily
inflicted
by
courtmartial
for
desertions
and
purely
military
offenses
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
the
british
have
solved
this
important
and
difficult
matter
in
a
satisfactory
way
i
commend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
details
of
the
new
disciplinary
system
and
recommend
that
laws
be
passed
putting
the
same
into
force
both
in
the
army
and
the
navy
i
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
that
part
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
which
he
recommends
the
formation
of
a
naval
reserve
by
the
organization
of
the
exsailors
of
the
navy
i
repeat
my
recommendation
made
last
year
that
proper
provision
should
be
made
for
the
rank
of
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
squadrons
and
fleets
of
the
navy
the
inconvenience
attending
the
necessary
precedence
that
most
foreign
admirals
have
over
our
own
whenever
they
meet
in
official
functions
ought
to
be
avoided
it
impairs
the
prestige
of
our
navy
and
is
a
defect
that
can
be
very
easily
removed
department
of
justice
this
department
has
been
very
active
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
it
has
been
better
organized
and
with
a
larger
force
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
government
the
prosecutions
which
have
been
successfully
concluded
and
which
are
now
pending
testify
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
departmental
work
the
prosecution
of
trusts
under
the
sherman
antitrust
law
has
gone
on
without
restraint
or
diminution
and
decrees
similar
to
those
entered
in
the
standard
oil
and
the
tobacco
cases
have
been
entered
in
other
suits
like
the
suits
against
the
powder
trust
and
the
bathtub
trust
i
am
very
strongly
convinced
that
a
steady
consistent
course
in
this
regard
with
a
continuing
of
supreme
court
decisions
upon
new
phases
of
the
trust
question
not
already
finally
decided
is
going
to
offer
a
solution
of
this
muchdiscussed
and
troublesome
issue
in
a
quiet
calm
and
judicial
way
without
any
radical
legislation
changing
the
governmental
policy
in
regard
to
combinations
now
denounced
by
the
sherman
antitrust
law
i
have
already
recommended
as
an
aid
in
this
matter
legislation
which
would
declare
unlawful
certain
wellknown
phases
of
unfair
competition
in
interstate
trade
and
i
have
also
advocated
voluntary
national
incorporation
for
the
larger
industrial
enterprises
with
provision
for
a
closer
supervision
by
the
bureau
of
corporations
or
a
board
appointed
for
the
purpose
so
as
to
make
more
certain
compliance
with
the
antitrust
law
on
the
one
hand
and
to
give
greater
security
to
the
stockholders
against
possible
prosecutions
on
the
other
i
believe
however
that
the
orderly
course
of
litigation
in
the
courts
and
the
regular
prosecution
of
trusts
charged
with
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
is
producing
among
business
men
a
clearer
and
clearer
perception
of
the
line
of
distinction
between
business
that
is
to
be
encouraged
and
business
that
is
to
be
condemned
and
that
in
this
quiet
way
the
question
of
trusts
can
be
settled
and
competition
retained
as
an
economic
force
to
secure
reasonableness
in
prices
and
freedom
and
independence
in
trade
reform
of
court
procedure
i
am
glad
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
congress
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
has
radically
altered
the
equity
rules
governing
the
procedure
on
the
equity
side
of
all
federal
courts
and
though
as
these
changes
have
not
been
yet
put
in
practice
so
as
to
enable
us
to
state
from
actual
results
what
the
reform
will
accomplish
they
are
of
such
a
character
that
we
can
reasonably
prophesy
that
they
will
greatly
reduce
the
time
and
cost
of
litigation
in
such
courts
the
court
has
adopted
many
of
the
shorter
methods
of
the
present
english
procedure
and
while
it
may
take
a
little
while
for
the
profession
to
accustom
itself
to
these
methods
it
is
certain
greatly
to
facilitate
litigation
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
has
been
so
drastic
and
so
full
of
appreciation
of
the
necessity
for
a
great
reform
in
court
procedure
that
i
have
no
hesitation
in
following
up
this
action
with
a
recommendation
which
i
foreshadowed
in
my
message
of
three
years
ago
that
the
sections
of
the
statute
governing
the
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
commonlaw
side
should
be
so
amended
as
to
give
to
the
supreme
court
the
same
right
to
make
rules
of
procedure
in
common
law
as
they
have
since
the
beginning
of
the
court
exercised
in
equity
i
do
not
doubt
that
a
full
consideration
of
the
subject
will
enable
the
court
while
giving
effect
to
the
substantial
differences
in
right
and
remedy
between
the
system
of
common
law
and
the
system
of
equity
so
to
unite
the
two
procedures
into
the
form
of
one
civil
action
and
to
shorten
the
procedure
in
such
civil
action
as
to
furnish
a
model
to
all
the
state
courts
exercising
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
courts
of
first
instance
under
the
statute
now
in
force
the
commonlaw
procedure
in
each
federal
court
is
made
to
conform
to
the
procedure
in
the
state
in
which
the
court
is
held
in
these
days
when
we
should
be
making
progress
in
court
procedure
such
a
conformity
statute
makes
the
federal
method
too
dependent
upon
the
action
of
state
legislatures
i
can
but
think
it
a
great
opportunity
for
congress
to
intrust
to
the
highest
tribunal
in
this
country
evidently
imbued
with
a
strong
spirit
in
favor
of
a
reform
of
procedure
the
power
to
frame
a
model
code
of
procedure
which
while
preserving
all
that
is
valuable
and
necessary
of
the
rights
and
remedies
at
common
law
and
in
equity
shall
lessen
the
burden
of
the
poor
litigant
to
a
minimum
in
the
expedition
and
cheapness
with
which
his
cause
can
be
fought
or
defended
through
federal
courts

appointed
by

passed

and
is
now
pending
in
the
house
the
passage
of
which
i
have
in
previous
messages
urged
upon
congress
i
venture
again
to
call
to
its
attention
the
opposition
to
it
which
developed
in
the
senate
but
which
was
overcome
by
a
majority
in
that
body
seemed
to
me
to
grow
out
rather
of
a
misapprehension
of
its
effect
than
of
opposition
to
its
principle
i
say
again
that
i
think
no
act
can
have
a
better
effect
directly
upon
the
relations
between
the
employer
and
employee
than
this
act
applying
to
railroads
and
common
carriers
of
an
interstate
character
and
i
am
sure
that
the
passage
of
the
act
would
greatly
relieve
the
courts
of
the
heaviest
burden
of
litigation
that
they
have
and
would
enable
them
to
dispatch
other
business

a
speed

this
is
the
third
of
a
series
of
messages

i
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
the
important
transactions
of
the
government
in
each
of
its
departments
during
the
last
year

have
discussed
needed
reforms
heads
of
departments
should
have
seats
on
the
floor
of

i
recommend
the
adoption
of
legislation
which
shall
make
it
the
duty
of
heads
of
departmentsthe
members
of
the
presidents
cabinetat
convenient
times
to
attend
the
session
of
the
house
and
the
senate
which
shall
provide
seats
for
them
in
each
house
and
give
them
the
opportunity
to
take
part
in
all
discussions
and
to
answer
questions
of
which
they
have
had
due
notice
the
rigid
holding
apart
of
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
of
this
government
has
not
worked
for
the
great
advantage
of
either
there
has
been
much
lost
motion
in
the
machinery
due
to
the
lack
of
cooperation
and
interchange
of
views
face
to
face
between
the
representatives
of
the
executive
and
the
members
of
the
two
legislative
branches
of
the
government
it
was
never
intended
that
they
should
be
separated
in
the
sense
of
not
being
in
constant
effective
touch
and
relationship
to
each
other
the
legislative
and
the
executive
each
performs
its
own
appropriate
function
but
these
functions
must
be
coordinated
time
and
time
again
debates
have
arisen
in
each
house
upon
issues
which
the
information
of
a
particular
department
head
would
have
enabled
him
if
present
to
end
at
once
by
a
simple
explanation
or
statement
time
and
time
again
a
forceful
and
earnest
presentation
of
facts
and
arguments
by
the
representative
of
the
executive
whose
duty
it
is
to
enforce
the
law
wo
uld
have
brought
about
a
useful
reform
by
amendment
which
in
the
absence
of
such
a
statement
has
failed
of
passage
i
do
not
think
i
am
mistaken
in
saying
that
the
presence
of
the
members
of
the
cabinet
on
the
floor
of
each
house
would
greatly
contribute
to
the
enactment
of
beneficial
legislation
nor
would
this
in
any
degree
deprive
either
the
legislative
or
the
executive
of
the
independence
which
separation
of
the
two
branches
has
been
intended
to
promote
it
would
only
facilitate
their
cooperation
in
the
public
interest
on
the
other
hand
i
am
sure
that
the
necessity
and
duty
imposed
upon
department
heads
of
appearing
in
each
house
and
in
answer
to
searching
questions
of
rendering
upon
their
feet
an
account
of
what
they
have
done
or
what
has
been
done
by
the
administration
will
spur
each
member
of
the
cabinet
to
closer
attention
to
the
details
of
his
department
to
greater
familiarity
with
its
needs
and
to
greater
care
to
avoid
the
just
criticism
which
the
answers
brought
out
in
questions
put
and
discussions
arising
between
the
members
of
either
house
and
the
members
of
the
cabinet
may
properly
evoke
objection
is
made
that
the
members
of
the
administration
having
no
vote
could
exercise
no
power
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
could
not
assume
that
attitude
of
authority
and
control
which
the
english
parliamentary
government
have
and
which
enables
them
to
meet
the
responsibilities
the
english
system
thrusts
upon
them
i
agree
that
in
certain
respects
it
would
be
more
satisfactory
if
members
of
the
cabinet
could
at
the
same
time
be
members
of
both
houses
with
voting
power
but
this
is
impossible
under
our
system
and
while
a
lack
of
this
feature
may
detract
from
the
influence
of
the
department
chiefs
it
will
not
prevent
the
good
results
which
i
have
described
above
both
in
the
matter
of
legislation
and
in
the
matter
of
administration
the
enactment
of
such
a
law
would
be
quite
within
the
power
of
congress
without
constitutional
amendment
and
it
has
such
possibilities
of
usefulness
that
we
might
well
make
the
experiment
and
if
we
are
disappointed
the
misstep
can
be
easily
retraced
by
a
repeal
of
the
enabling
legislation
this
is
not
a
new
proposition
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
thirtyeighth
congress
the
proposition
was
referred
to
a
select
committee
of
seven
members
the
committee
made
an
extensive
report
and
urged
the
adoption
of
the
reform
the
report
showed
that
our
history
had
not
been
without
illustration
of
the
necessity
and
the
examples
of
the
practice
by
pointing
out
that
in
early
days
secretaries
were
repeatedly
called
to
the
presence
of
either
rouse
for
consultation
advice
and
information
it
also
referred
to
remarks
of
mr
justice
story
in
his
commentaries
on
the
constitution
in
which
he
urgently
presented
the
wisdom
of
such
a
change
this
report
is
to
be
found
in
volume
i
of
the
reports
of
committees
of
the
first
session
of
the
thirtyeighth
congress
april
again
on
february
a
select
committee
of
the
senate
recommended
the
passage
of
a
similar
bill
and
made
a
report
in
which
while
approving
the
separation
of
the
three
branches
the
executive
legislative
and
judicial
they
point
out
as
a
reason
for
the
proposed
change
that
although
having
a
separate
existence
the
branches
are
to
cooperate
each
with
the
other
as
the
different
members
of
the
human
body
must
cooperate
with
each
other
in
order
to
form
the
figure
and
perform
the
duties
of
a
perfect
man
the
report
concluded
as
follows
this
system
will
require
the
selection
of
the
strongest
men
to
be
heads
of
departments
and
will
require
them
to
be
well
equipped
with
the
knowledge
of
their
offices
it
will
also
require
the
strongest
men
to
be
the
leaders
of
congress
and
participate
in
debate
it
will
bring
these
strong
men
in
contact
perhaps
into
conflict
to
advance
the
public
weal
and
thus
stimulate
their
abilities
and
their
efforts
and
will
thus
assuredly
result
to
the
good
of
the
country
if
it
should
appear
by
actual
experience
that
the
heads
of
departments
in
fact
have
not
time
to
perform
the
additional
duty
imposed
on
them
by
this
bill
the
force
in
their
offices
should
be
increased
or
the
duties
devolving
on
them
personally
should
be
diminished
an
undersecretary
should
be
appointed
to
whom
could
be
confided
that
routine
of
administration
which
requires
only
order
and
accuracy
the
principal
officers
could
then
confine
their
attention
to
those
duties
which
require
wise
discretion
and
intellectual
activity
thus
they
would
have
abundance
of
time
for
their
duties
under
this
bill
indeed
your
committee
believes
that
the
public
interest
would
be
subserved
if
the
secretaries
were
relieved
of
the
harassing
cares
of
distributing
clerkships
and
closely
supervising
the
mere
machinery
of
the
departments
your
committee
believes
that
the
adoption
of
this
bill
and
the
effective
execution
of
its
provisions
will
be
the
first
step
toward
a
sound
civilservice
reform
which
will
secure
a
larger
wisdom
in
the
adoption
of
policies
and
a
better
system

has

that
it

appropriation
act
of
last
year
a
general
system
was
provided

its
installation
was
directed
by
the
st
of
january
this
has
entailed
upon
the
post
office
department
a
great
deal
of
very
heavy
labor
but
the
postmaster
general
informs
me
that
on
the
date
selected
to
wit
the
st
of
january
near
at
hand
the
department
will
be
in
readiness
to
meet
successfully
the
requirements
of
the
public
classification
of
postmasters
a
trial
during
the
past
three
years
of
the
system
of
classifying
fourthclass
postmasters
in
that
part
of
the
country
lying
between
the
mississippi
river
on
the
west
canada
on
the
north
the
atlantic
ocean
on
the
east
and
mason
and
dixons
line
on
the
south
has
been
sufficiently
satisfactory
to
justify
the
postal
authorities
in
recommending
the
extension
of
the
order
to
include
all
the
fourthclass
postmasters
in
the
country
in
september
upon
the
suggestion
of
the
postmaster
general
i
directed
him
to
prepare
an
order
which
should
put
the
system
in
effect
except
in
alaska
guam
hawaii
porto
rico
and
samoa
under
date
of
october
i
issued
such
an
order
which
affected
postmasters
by
the
order
the
post
offices
were
divided
into
groups
a
and
b
group
a
includes
all
postmasters
whose
compensation
is
or
more
and
group
b
those
whose
compensation
is
less
than
that
sum
different
methods
are
pursued
in
the
selection
of
the
postmasters
for
group
a
and
group
b
criticism
has
been
made
of
this
order
on
the
ground
that
the
motive
for
it
was
political
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
the
order
was
made
before
the
election
and
in
the
interest
of
efficient
public
service
i
have
several
times
requested
congress
to
give
me
authority
to
put
first
second
and
thirdclass
postmasters
and
all
other
local
officers
including
internalrevenue
officers
customs
officers
united
states
marshals
and
the
local
agents
of
the
other
departments
under
the
classification
of
the
civilservice
law
by
taking
away
the
necessity
for
confirming
such
appointments
by
the
senate
i
deeply
regret
the
failure
of
congress
to
follow
these
recommendations
the
change
would
have
taken
out
of
politics
practically
every
local
officer
and
would
have
entirely
cured
the
evils
growing
out
of
what
under
the
present
law
must
always
remain
a
remnant
of
the
spoils
system
compensation
to
railways
for
carrying
mails
it
is
expected
that
the
establishment
of
a
parcel
post
on
january
st
will
largely
increase
the
amount
of
mail
matter
to
be
transported
by
the
railways
and
congress
should
be
prompt
to
provide
a
way
by
which
they
may
receive
the
additional
compensation
to
which
they
will
be
entitled
the
postmaster
general
urges
that
the
departments
plan
for
a
complete
readjustment
of
the
system
of
paying
the
railways
for
carrying
the
mails
be
adopted
substituting
space
for
weight
as
the
principal
factor
in
fixing
compensation
under
this
plan
it
will
be
possible
to
determine
without
delay
what
additional
payment
should
be
made
on
account
of
the
parcel
post
the
postmaster
generals
recommendation
is
based
on
the
results
of
a
farreaching
investigation
begun
early
in
the
administration
with
the
object
of
determining
what
it
costs
the
railways
to
carry
the
mails
the
statistics
obtained
during
the
course
of
the
inquiry
show
that
while
many
of
the
railways
and
particularly
the
large
systems
were
making
profits
from
mail
transportations
certain
of
the
lines
were
actually
carrying
the
mails
at
a
loss
a
s
a
result
of
the
investigation
the
department
after
giving
the
subject
careful
consideration
decided
to
urge
the
abandonment
of
the
present
plan
of
fixing
compensation
on
the
basis
of
the
weight
of
the
mails
carried
a
plan
that
has
proved
to
be
exceedingly
expensive
and
in
other
respects
unsatisfactory
under
the
method
proposed
the
railway
companies
will
annually
submit
to
the
department
reports
showing
what
it
costs
them
to
carry
the
mails
and
this
cost
will
be
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
the
car
space
engaged
payment
to
be
allowed
at
the
rate
thus
determined
in
amounts
that
will
cover
the
cost
and
a
reasonable
profit
if
a
railway
is
not
satisfied
with
the
manner
in
which
the
department
apportions
the
cost
in
fixing
compensation
it
is
to
have
the
right
tinder
the
new
plan
of
appealing
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
this
feature
of
the
proposed
law
would
seem
to
insure
a
fair
treatment
of
the
railways
it
is
hoped
that
congress
will
give
the

recommended
by

some

authorized
department
of
the
interior
the
interior
department
in
the
problems
of
administration
included
within
its
jurisdiction
presents
more
difficult
questions
than
any
other
this
has
been
due
perhaps
to
temporary
causes
of
a
political
character
but
more
especially
to
the
inherent
difficulty
in
the
performance
of
some
of
the
functions
which
are
assigned
to
it
its
chief
duty
is
the
guardianship
of
the
public
domain
and
the
disposition
of
that
domain
to
private
ownership
under
homestead
mining
and
other
laws
by
which
patents
from
the
government
to
the
individual
are
authorized
on
certain
conditions
during
the
last
decade
the
public
seemed
to
become
suddenly
aware
that
a
very
large
part
of
its
domain
had
passed
from
its
control
into
private
ownership
under
laws
not
well
adapted
to
modern
conditions
and
also
that
in
the
doing
of
this
the
provisions
of
existing
law
and
regulations
adopted
in
accordance
with
law
had
not
been
strictly
observed
and
that
in
the
transfer
of
title
much
fraud
had
intervened
to
the
pecuniary
benefit
of
dishonest
persons
there
arose
thereupon
a
demand
for
conservation
of
the
public
domain
its
protection
against
fraudulent
diminution
and
the
preservation
of
that
part
of
it
from
private
acquisition
which
it
seemed
necessary
to
keep
for
future
public
use
the
movement
excellent
in
the
intention
which
prompted
it
and
useful
in
its
results
has
nevertheless
had
some
bad
effects
which
the
western
country
has
recently
been
feeling
and
in
respect
of
which
there
is
danger
of
a
reaction
toward
older
abuses
unless
we
can
attain
the
golden
mean
which
consists
in
the
prevention
of
the
mere
exploitation
of
the
public
domain
for
private
purposes
while
at
the
same
time
facilitating
its
development
for
the
benefit
of
the
local
public
the
land
laws
need
complete
revision
to
secure
proper
conservation
on
the
one
hand
of
land
that
ought
to
be
kept
in
public
use
and
on
the
other
hand
prompt
disposition
of
those
lands
which
ought
to
be
disposed
in
private
ownership
or
turned
over
to
private
use
by
properly
guarded
leases
in
addition
to
this
there
are
not
enough
officials
in
our
land
department
with
legal
knowledge
sufficient
promptly
to
make
the
decisions
which
are
called
for
the
whole
landlaws
system
should
be
reorganized
and
not
until
it
is
reorganized
will
decisions
be
made
as
promptly
as
they
ought
or
will
men
who
have
earned
title
to
public
land
under
the
statute
receive
their
patents
within
a
reasonably
short
period
the
present
administration
has
done
what
it
could
in
this
regard
but
the
necessity
for
reform
and
change
by
a
revision
of
the
laws
and
an
increase
and
reorganization
of
the
force
remains
and
i
submit
to
congress
the
wisdom
of
a
full
examination
of
this
subject
in
order
that
a
very
large
and
important
part
of
our
people
in
the
west
may
be
relieved
from
a
just
cause
of
irritation
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
discussion
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
the
need
for
legislation
with
respect
to
mining
claims
leases
of
coal
lands
in
this
country
and
in
alaska
and
for
similar
disposition
of
oil
phosphate
and
potash
lands
and
also
to
his
discussion
of
the
proper
use
to
be
made
of
waterpower
sites
held
by
the
government
many
of
these
lands
are
now
being
withheld
from
use
by
the
public
under
the
general
withdrawal
act
which
was
passed
by
the
last
congress
that
act
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
the
question
but
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
lands
until
the
question
could
be
solved
i
earnestly
urge
that
the
matter
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
our
western
fellow
citizens
and
ought
to
command
the
immediate
attention
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
another
function
which
the
interior
department
has
to
perform
is
that
of
the
guardianship
of
indians
in
spite
of
everything
which
has
been
said
in
criticism
of
the
policy
of
our
government
toward
the
indians
the
amount
of
wealth
which
is
now
held
by
it
for
these
wards
per
capita
shows
that
the
government
has
been
generous
but
the
management
of
so
large
an
estate
with
the
great
variety
of
circumstances
that
surround
each
tribe
and
each
case
calls
for
the
exercise
of
the
highest
business
discretion
and
the
machinery
provided
in
the
indian
bureau
for
the
discharge
of
this
function
is
entirely
inadequate
the
position
of
indian
commissioner
demands
the
exercise
of
business
ability
of
the
first
order
and
it
is
difficult
to
secure
such
talent
for
the
salary
provided
the
condition
of
health
of
the
indian
and
the
prevalence
in
the
tribes
of
curable
diseases
has
been
exploited
recently
in
the
press
in
a
message
to
congress
at
its
last
session
i
brought
this
subject
to
its
attention
and
invited
a
special
appropriation
in
order
that
our
facilities
for
overcoming
diseases
among
the
indians
might
be
properly
increased
but
no
action
was
then
taken
by
congress
on
the
subject
nor
has
such
appropriation
been
made
since
the
commission
appointed
by
authority
of
the
congress
to
report
on
proper
method
of
securing
railroad
development
in
alaska
is
formulating
its
report
and
i
expect
to
have
an
opportunity
before
the
end
of
this
session
to
submit
its
recommendations
department
of
agriculture
the
farreaching
utility
of
the
educational
system
carried
on
by
the
department
of
agriculture
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmers
of
our
country
calls
for
no
elaboration
each
year
there
is
a
growth
in
the
variety
of
facts
which
it
brings
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmer
and
each
year
confirms
the
wisdom
of
the
expenditure
of
the
appropriations
made
for
that
department
purefood
law
the
department
of
agriculture
is
charged
with
the
execution
of
the
purefood
law
the
passage
of
this
encountered
much
opposition
from
manufacturers
and
others
who
feared
the
effect
upon
their
business
of
the
enforcement
of
its
provisions
the
opposition
aroused
the
just
indignation
of
the
public
and
led
to
an
intense
sympathy
with
the
severe
and
rigid
enforcement
of
the
provisions
of
the
new
law
it
had
to
deal
in
many
instances
with
the
question
whether
or
not
products
of
large
business
enterprises
in
the
form
of
food
preparations
were
deleterious
to
the
public
health
and
while
in
a
great
majority
of
instances
this
issue
was
easily
determinable
there
were
not
a
few
cases
in
which
it
was
hard
to
draw
the
line
between
a
useful
and
a
harmful
food
preparation
in
cases
like
this
when
a
decision
involved
the
destruction
of
great
business
enterprises
representing
the
investment
of
large
capital
and
the
expenditure
of
great
energy
and
ability
the
danger
of
serious
injustice
was
very
considerable
in
the
enforcement
of
a
new
law
under
the
spur
of
great
public
indignation
the
public
officials
charged
with
executing
the
law
might
do
injustice
in
heated
controversy
through
unconscious
pride
of
opinion
and
obstinacy
of
conclusion
for
this
reason
president
roosevelt
felt
justified
in
creating
a
board
of
experts
known
as
the
remsen
board
to
whom
in
cases
of
much
importance
an
appeal
might
be
taken
and
a
review
had
of
a
decision
of
the
bureau
of
chemistry
in
the
agricultural
department
i
heartily
agree
that
it
was
wise
to
create
this
board
in
order
that
injustice
might
not
be
done
the
questions
which
arise
are
not
generally
those
involving
palpable
injury
to
health
but
they
are
upon
the
narrow
and
doubtful
line
in
respect
of
which
it
is
better
to
be
in
some
error
not
dangerous
than
to
be
radically
destructive
i
think
that
the
time
has
come
for
congress
to
recognize
the
necessity
for
some
such
tribunal
of
appeal
and
to
make
specific
statutory
provision
for
it
while
we
are
struggling
to
suppress
an
evil
of
great
proportions
like
that
of
impure
food
we
must
provide
machinery
in
the
law
itself
to
prevent
its
becoming
an
instrument
of
oppression
and
we
ought
to
enable
those
whose
business
is
threatened
with
annihilation
to
have
some
tribunal
and
some
form
of
appeal
in
which
they
have
a
complete
day
in
court
agricultural
credits
i
referred
in
my
first
message
to
the
question
of
improving
the
system
of
agricultural
credits
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
made
an
investigation
into
the
matter
of
credits
in
this
country
and
i
commend
a
consideration
of
the
information
which
through
his
agents
he
has
been
able
to
collect
it
does
not
in
any
way
minimize
the
importance
of
the
proposal
but
it
gives
more
accurate
information
upon
some
of
the
phases
of
the
question
than
we
have
heretofore
had
department
of
commerce
and
labor
i
commend
to
congress
an
examination
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
and
especially
that
part
in
which
he
discusses
the
office
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
the
value
to
commerce
of
a
proposed
trade
commission
and
the
steps
which
he
has
taken
to
secure
the
organization
of
a
national
chamber
of
commerce
i
heartily
commend
his
view
that
the
plan
of
a
trade
commission
which
looks
to
the
fixing
of
prices
is
altogether
impractical
and
ought
not
for
a
moment
to
be
considered
as
a
possible
solution
of
t
he
trust
question
the
trust
question
in
the
enforcement
of
the
sherman
antitrust
law
is
gradually
solving
itself
is
maintaining
the
principle
and
restoring
the
practice
of
competition
and
if
the
law
is
quietly
but
firmly
enforced
business
will
adjust
itself
to
the
statutory
requirements
and
the
unrest
in
commercial
circles
provoked
by
the
trust
discussion
will
disappear
panamapacific
international
exposition
in
conformity
with
a
joint
resolution
of
congress
an
executive
proclamation
was
issued
last
february
inviting
the
nations
of
the
world
to
participate
in
the
panamapacific
international
exposition
to
be
held
at
san
francisco
to
celebrate
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
a
sympathetic
response
was
immediately
forthcoming
and
several
nations
have
already
selected
the
sites
for
their
buildings
in
furtherance
of
my
invitation
a
special
commission
visited
european
countries
during
the
past
summer
and
received
assurance
of
hearty
cooperation
in
the
task
of
bringing
together
a
universal
industrial
military
and
naval
display
on
an
unprecedented
scale
it
is
evident
that
the
exposition
will
be
an
accurate
mirror
of
the
worlds
activities
as
they
appear
years
after
the
date
of
the
discovery
of
the
pacific
ocean
it
is
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
make
the
nations
welcome
at
san
francisco
and
to
facilitate
such
acquaintance
between
them
and
ourselves
as
will
promote
the
expansion
of
commerce
and
familiarize
the
world
with
the
new
trade
route
through
the
panama
canal
the
action
of
the
state
governments
and
individuals
assures
a
comprehensive
exhibit
of
the
resources
of
this
country
and
of
the
progress
of
the
people
this
participation
by
state
and
individuals
should
be
supplemented
by
an
adequate
showing
of
the
varied
and
unique
activities
of
the
national
government
the
united
states
can
not
with
good
grace
invite
foreign
governments
to
erect
buildings
and
make
expensive
exhibits
while
itself
refusing
to
participate
nor
would
it
be
wise
to
forego
the
opportunity
to
join
with
other
nations
in
the
inspiring
interchange
of
ideas
tending
to
promote
intercourse
friendship
and
commerce
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
to
foster
and
build
up
commerce
through
the
canal
just
as
it
was
the
duty
of
the
government
to
construct
it
i
earnestly
recommend
the
appropriation
at
this
session
of
such
a
sum
as
will
enable
the
united
states
to
construct
a
suitable
building
install
a
governmental
exhibit
and
otherwise
participate
in
the
panamapacific
international
exposition
in
a
manner
commensurate
with
the
dignity
of
a
nation
whose
guests
are
to
be
the
people
of
the
world
i
recommend
also
such
legislation
as
will
facilitate
the
entry
of
material
intended
for
exhibition
and
protect
foreign
exhibitors
against
infringement
of
patents
and
the
unauthorized
copying
of
patterns
and
designs
all
aliens
sent
to
san
francisco
to
construct
and
care
for
foreign
buildings
and
exhibits
should
be
admitted
without
restraint
or
embarrassment
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
city
of
washington
the
city
of
washington
is
a
beautiful
city
with
a
population
of
of
whom
are
colored
the
annual
municipal
budget
is
about
the
presence
of
the
national
capital
and
other
governmental
structures
constitutes
the
chief
beauty
and
interest
of
the
city
the
public
grounds
are
extensive
and
the
opportunities
for
improving
the
city
and
making
it
still
more
attractive
are
very
great
under
a
plan
adopted
some
years
ago
one
half
the
cost
of
running
the
city
is
paid
by
taxation
upon
the
property
real
and
personal
of
the
citizens
and
residents
and
the
other
half
is
borne
by
the
general
government
the
city
is
expanding
at
a
remarkable
rate
and
this
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
coming
here
from
other
parts
of
the
country
of
welltodo
people
who
having
finished
their
business
careers
elsewhere
build
and
make
this
their
permanent
place
of
residence
on
the
whole
the
city
as
a
municipality
is
very
well
governed
it
is
well
lighted
the
water
supply
is
good
the
streets
are
well
paved
the
police
force
is
well
disciplined
crime
is
not
flagrant
and
while
it
has
purlieus
and
centers
of
vice
like
other
large
cities
they
are
not
exploited
they
do
not
exercise
any
influence
or
control
in
the
government
of
the
city
and
they
are
suppressed
in
as
far
as
it
has
been
found
practicable
municipal
graft
is
inconsiderable
there
are
interior
courts
in
the
city
that
are
noisome
and
centers
of
disease
and
the
refuge
of
criminals
but
congress
has
begun
to
clean
these
out
and
progress
has
been
made
in
the
case
of
the
most
notorious
of
these
which
is
known
as
willow
tree
alley
this
movement
should
continue
the
mortality
for
the
past
year
was
at
the
rate
of
per
of
both
races
among
the
whites
it
was
per
thousand
and
among
the
blacks
per
thousand
these
are
the
lowest
mortality
rates
ever
recorded
in
the
district
one
of
the
most
crying
needs
in
the
government
of
the
district
is
a
tribunal
or
public
authority
for
the
purpose
of
supervising
the
corporations
engaged
in
the
operation
of
public
utilities
such
a
bill
is
pending
in
congress
and
ought
to
pass
washington
should
show
itself
under
the
direction
of
congress
to
be
a
city
with
a
model
form
of
government
but
as
long
as
such
authority
over
public
utilities
is
withheld
from
the
municipal
government
it
must
always
be
defective
without
undue
criticism
of
the
present
street
railway
accommodations
it
can
be
truly
said
that
under
the
spur
of
a
public
utilities
commission
they
might
be
substantially
improved
while
the
school
system
of
washington
perhaps
might
be
bettered
in
the
economy
of
its
management
and
the
distribution
of
its
buildings
its
usefulness
has
nevertheless
greatly
increased
in
recent
years
and
it
now
offers
excellent
facilities
for
primary
and
secondary
education
from
time
to
time
there
is
considerable
agitation
in
washington
in
favor
of
granting
the
citizens
of
the
city
the
franchise
and
constituting
an
elective
government
i
am
strongly
opposed
to
this
change
the
history
of
washington
discloses
a
number
of
experiments
of
this
kind
which
have
always
been
abandoned
as
unsatisfactory
the
truth
is
this
is
a
city
governed
by
a
popular
body
to
wit
the
congress
of
the
united
states
selected
from
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
own
washington
the
people
who
come
here
to
live
do
so
with
the
knowledge
of
the
origin
of
the
city
and
the
restrictions
and
therefore
voluntarily
give
up
the
privilege
of
living
in
a
municipality
governed
by
popular
vote
washington
is
so
unique
in
its
origin
and
in
its
use
for
housing
and
localizing
the
sovereignty
of
the
nation
that
the
people
who
live
here
must
regard
its
peculiar
character
and
must
be
content
to
subject
themselves
to
the
control
of
a
body
selected
by
all
the
people
of
the
nation
i
agree
that
there
are
certain
inconveniences
growing
out
of
the
government
of
a
city
by
a
national
legislature
like
congress
and
it
would
perhaps
be
possible
to
lessen
these
by
the
delegation
by
congress
to
the
district
commissioners
of
greater
legislative
power
for
the
enactment
of
local
laws
than
they
now
possess
especially
those
of
a
police
character
every
loyal
american
has
a
personal
pride
in
the
beauty
of
washington
and
in
its
development
and
growth
there
is
no
one
with
a
proper
appreciation
of
our
capital
city
who
would
favor
a
niggardly
policy
in
respect
to
expenditures
from
the
national
treasury
to
add
to
the
attractiveness
of
this
city
which
belongs
to
every
citizen
of
the
entire
country
and
which
no
citizen
visits
without
a
sense
of
pride
of
ownership
we
have
had
restored
by
a
commission
of
fine
arts
at
the
instance
of
a
committee
of
the
senate
the
original
plan
of
the
french
engineer
lenfant
for
the
city
of
washington
and
we
know
with
great
certainty
the
course
which
the
improvement
of
washington
should
take
why
should
there
be
delay
in
making
this
improvement
in
so
far
as
it
involves
the
extension
of
the
parking
system
and
the
construction
of
greatly
needed
public
buildings
appropriate
buildings
for
the
state
department
the
department
of
justice
and
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
have
been
projected
plans
have
been
approved
and
nothing
is
wanting
but
the
appropriations
for
the
beginning
and
completion
of
the
structures
a
hall
of
archives
is
also
badly
needed
but
nothing
has
been
done
toward
its
construction
although
the
land
for
it
has
long
been
bought
and
paid
for
plans
have
been
made
for
the
union
of
potomac
park
with
the
valley
of
rock
creek
and
rock
creek
park
and
the
necessity
for
the
connection
between
the
soldiers
home
and
rock
creek
park
calls
for
no
comment
i
ask
again
why
there
should
be
delay
in
carrying
out
these
plans
we
have
the
money
in
the
treasury
the
plans
are
national
in
their
scope
and
the
improvement
should
be
treated
as
a
national
project
the
plan
will
find
a
hearty
approval
throughout
the
country
i
am
quite
sure
from
the
information
which
i
have
that
at
comparatively
small
expense
from
that
part
of
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
retroceded
to
virginia
the
portion
including
the
arlington
estate
fort
myer
and
the
palisades
of
the
potomac
can
be
acquired
by
purchase
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
virginia
over
this
land
ceded
to
the
nation
this
ought
to
be
done
the
construction
of
the
lincoln
memorial
and
of
a
memorial
bridge
from
the
base
of
the
lincoln
monument
to
arlington
would
be
an
appropriate
and
symbolic
expression
of
the
union
of
the
north
and
the
south
at
the
capital
of
the
nation
i
urge
upon
congress
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
undertake
these
national
improvements
and
to
submit
a
plan
for
their
execution
and
when
the
plan
has
been
submitted
and
approved
and
the
work
carried
out
washington
will
really
become
what
it
ought
to
bethe
most
beautiful
city
in
the
world

part
i
this
message
is
the
first
of
several
which
i
shall
send
to
congress
during
the
interval
between
the
opening
of
its
regular
session
and
its
adjournment
for
the
christmas
holidays
the
amount
of
information
to
be
communicated
as
to
the
operations
of
the
government
the
number
of
important
subjects
calling
for
comment
by
the
executive
and
the
transmission
to
congress
of
exhaustive
reports
of
special
commissions
make
it
impossible
to
include
in
one
message
of
a
reasonable
length
a
discussion
of
the
topics
that
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
national
legislature
at
its
first
regular
session
the
antitrust
lawthe
supreme
court
decisions
in
may
last
the
supreme
court
handed
down
decisions
in
the
suits
in
equity
brought
by
the
united
states
to
enjoin
the
further
maintenance
of
the
standard
oil
trust
and
of
the
american
tobacco
trust
and
to
secure
their
dissolution
the
decisions
are
epochmaking
and
serve
to
advise
the
business
world
authoritatively
of
the
scope
and
operation
of
the
antitrust
act
of
the
decisions
do
not
depart
in
any
substantial
way
from
the
previous
decisions
of
the
court
in
construing
and
applying
this
important
statute
but
they
clarify
those
decisions
by
further
defining
the
already
admitted
exceptions
to
the
literal
construction
of
the
act
by
the
decrees
they
furnish
a
useful
precedent
as
to
the
proper
method
of
dealing
with
the
capital
and
property
of
illegal
trusts
these
decisions
suggest
the
need
and
wisdom
of
additional
or
supplemental
legislation
to
make
it
easier
for
the
entire
business
community
to
square
with
the
rule
of
action
and
legality
thus
finally
established
and
to
preserve
the
benefit
freedom
and
spur
of
reasonable
competition
without
loss
of
real
efficiency
or
progress
no
change
in
the
rule
of
decisionmerely
in
its
form
of
expression
the
statute
in
its
first
section
declares
to
be
illegal
every
contract
combination
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
or
commerce
among
the
several
states
or
with
foreign
nations
and
in
the
second
declares
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
every
person
who
shall
monopolize
or
attempt
to
monopolize
or
combine
or
conspire
with
any
other
person
to
monopolize
any
part
of
the
trade
or
commerce
of
the
several
states
or
with
foreign
nations
in
two
early
cases
where
the
statute
was
invoked
to
enjoin
a
transportation
rate
agreement
between
interstate
railroad
companies
it
was
held
that
it
was
no
defense
to
show
that
the
agreement
as
to
rates
complained
of
was
reasonable
at
common
law
because
it
was
said
that
the
statute
was
directed
against
all
contracts
and
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
whether
reasonable
at
common
law
or
not
it
was
plain
from
the
record
however
that
the
contracts
complained
of
in
those
cases
would
not
have
been
deemed
reasonable
at
common
law
in
subsequent
cases
the
court
said
that
the
statute
should
be
given
a
reasonable
construction
and
refused
to
include
within
its
inhibition
certain
contractual
restraints
of
trade
which
it
denominated
as
incidental
or
as
indirect
these
cases
of
restraint
of
trade
that
the
court
excepted
from
the
operation
of
the
statute
were
instances
which
at
common
law
would
have
been
called
reasonable
in
the
standard
oil
and
tobacco
cases
therefore
the
court
merely
adopted
the
tests
of
the
common
law
and
in
defining
exceptions
to
the
literal
application
of
the
statute
only
substituted
for
the
test
of
being
incidental
or
indirect
that
of
being
reasonable
and
this
without
varying
in
the
slightest
the
actual
scope
and
effect
of
the
statute
in
other
words
all
the
cases
under
the
statute
which
have
now
been
decided
would
have
been
decided
the
same
way
if
the
court
had
originally
accepted
in
its
construction
the
rule
at
common
law
it
has
been
said
that
the
court
by
introducing
into
the
construction
of
the
statute
commonlaw
distinctions
has
emasculated
it
this
is
obviously
untrue
by
its
judgment
every
contract
and
combination
in
restraint
of
interstate
trade
made
with
the
purpose
or
necessary
effect
of
controlling
prices
by
stifling
competition
or
of
establishing
in
whole
or
in
part
a
monopoly
of
such
trade
is
condemned
by
the
statute
the
most
extreme
critics
can
not
instance
a
case
that
ought
to
be
condemned
under
the
statute
which
is
not
brought
within
its
terms
as
thus
construed
the
suggestion
is
also
made
that
the
supreme
court
by
its
decision
in
the
last
two
cases
has
committed
to
the
court
the
undefined
and
unlimited
discretion
to
determine
whether
a
case
of
restraint
of
trade
is
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
this
is
wholly
untrue
a
reasonable
restraint
of
trade
at
common
law
is
well
understood
and
is
clearly
defined
it
does
not
rest
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
it
must
be
limited
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
a
lawful
main
contract
to
which
in
order
that
it
shall
be
enforceable
at
all
it
must
be
incidental
if
it
exceed
the
needs
of
that
contract
it
is
void
the
test
of
reasonableness
was
never
applied
by
the
court
at
common
law
to
contracts
or
combinations
or
conspiracies
in
restraint
of
trade
whose
purpose
was
or
whose
necessary
effect
would
be
to
stifle
competition
to
control
prices
or
establish
monopolies
the
courts
never
assumed
power
to
say
that
such
contracts
or
combinations
or
conspiracies
might
be
lawful
if
the
parties
to
them
were
only
moderate
in
the
use
of
the
power
thus
secured
and
did
not
exact
from
the
public
too
great
and
exorbitant
prices
it
is
true
that
many
theorists
and
others
engaged
in
business
violating
the
statute
have
hoped
that
some
such
line
could
be
drawn
by
courts
but
no
court
of
authority
has
ever
attempted
it
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
decisions
of
the
latest
two
cases
from
which
such
a
dangerous
theory
of
judicial
discretion
in
enforcing
this
statute
can
derive
the
slightest
sanction
force
and
effectiveness
of
statute
a
matter
of
growth
we
have
been
twentyone
years
making
this
statute
effective
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
enacted
the
knight
case
was
discouraging
and
seemed
to
remit
to
the
states
the
whole
available
power
to
attack
and
suppress
the
evils
of
the
trusts
slowly
however
the
error
of
that
judgment
was
corrected
and
only
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
has
the
heavy
hand
of
the
law
been
laid
upon
the
great
illegal
combinations
that
have
exercised
such
an
absolute
dominion
over
many
of
our
industries
criminal
prosecutions
have
been
brought
and
a
number
are
pending
but
juries
have
felt
averse
to
convicting
for
jail
sentences
and
judges
have
been
most
reluctant
to
impose
such
sentences
on
men
of
respectable
standing
in
society
whose
offense
has
been
regarded
as
merely
statutory
still
as
the
offense
becomes
better
understood
and
the
committing
of
it
partakes
more
of
studied
and
deliberate
defiance
of
the
law
we
can
be
confident
that
juries
will
convict
individuals
and
that
jail
sentences
will
be
imposed
the
remedy
in
equity
by
dissolution
in
the
standard
oil
case
the
supreme
and
circuit
courts
found
the
combination
to
be
a
monopoly
of
the
interstate
business
of
refining
transporting
and
marketing
petroleum
and
its
products
effected
and
maintained
through
thirtyseven
different
corporations
the
stock
of
which
was
held
by
a
new
jersey
company
it
in
effect
commanded
the
dissolution
of
this
combination
directed
the
transfer
and
pro
rata
distribution
by
the
new
jersey
company
of
the
stock
held
by
it
in
the
thirtyseven
corporations
to
and
among
its
stockholders
and
the
corporations
and
individual
defendants
were
enjoined
from
conspiring
or
combining
to
restore
such
monopoly
and
all
agreements
between
the
subsidiary
corporations
tending
to
produce
or
bring
about
further
violations
of
the
act
were
enjoined
in
the
tobacco
case
the
court
found
that
the
individual
defendants
twentynine
in
number
had
been
engaged
in
a
successful
effort
to
acquire
complete
dominion
over
the
manufacture
sale
and
distribution
of
tobacco
in
this
country
and
abroad
and
that
this
had
been
done
by
combinations
made
with
a
purpose
and
effect
to
stifle
competition
control
prices
and
establish
a
monopoly
not
only
in
the
manufacture
of
tobacco
but
also
of
tinfoil
and
licorice
used
in
its
manufacture
and
of
its
products
of
cigars
cigarettes
and
snuffs
the
tobacco
suit
presented
a
far
more
complicated
and
difficult
case
than
the
standard
oil
suit
for
a
decree
which
would
effectuate
the
will
of
the
court
and
end
the
violation
of
the
statute
there
was

the
american

the
plan
adopted
to
destroy
the

and

involved
the
redivision
of
the

of
the
whole
trust
between
some
of
the
companies
constituting
the

constitutes
a
very
decided
change
in
the
character
of
the

control
of

in

original

were
twentynine
defendants

thus

from
extending
its

during

period
all
parties
to

from

lending
money

objection
was
made
by
certain
independent
tobacco
companies
that
this
settlement
was
unjust
because
it
left
companies
with
very
large
capital
in
active
business
and
that
the
settlement
that
would
be
effective
to
put
all
on
an
equality
would
be
a
division
of
the
capital
and
plant
of
the
trust
into
small
fractions
in
amount
more
nearly
equal
to
that
of
each
of
the
independent
companies
this
contention
results
from
a
misunderstanding
of
the
antitrust
law
and
its
purpose
it
is
not
intended
thereby
to
prevent
the
accumulation
of
large
capital
in
business
enterprises
in
which
such
a
combination
can
secure
reduced
cost
of
production
sale
and
distribution
it
is
directed
against
such
an
aggregation
of
capital
only
when
its
purpose
is
that
of
stifling
competition
enhancing
or
controlling
prices
and
establishing
a
monopoly
if
we
shall
have
by
the
decree
defeated
these
purposes
and
restored
competition
between
the
large
units
into
which
the
capital
and
plant
have
been
divided
we
shall
have
accomplished
the
useful
purpose
of
the
statute
confiscation
not
the
purpose
of
the
statute
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
confiscate
the
property
and
capital
of
the
offending
trusts
methods
of
punishment
by
fine
or
imprisonment
of
the
individual
offenders
by
fine
of
the
corporation
or
by
forfeiture
of
its
goods
in
transportation
are
provided
but
the
proceeding
in
equity
is
a
specific
remedy
to
stop
the
operation
of
the
trust
by

and
prevent
the
future
use
of
the

and
capital
in
violation
of
the
statute
effectiveness
of
decree
i
venture
to
say
that
not
in
the
history
of
american
law
has
a
decree
more
effective
for
such
a
purpose
been
entered
by
a
court
than
that
against
the
tobacco
trust
as
circuit
judge
noyes
said
in
his
judgment
approving
the
decree
the
extent
to
which
it
has
been
necessary
to
tear
apart
this
combination
and
force
it
into
new
forms
with
the
attendant
burdens
ought
to
demonstrate
that
the
federal
antitrust
statute
is
a
drastic
statute
which
accomplishes
effective
results
which
so
long
as
it
stands
on
the
statute
books
must
be
obeyed
and
which
can
not
be
disobeyed
without
incurring
farreaching
penalties
and
on
the
other
hand
the
successful
reconstruction
of
this
organization
should
teach
that
the
effect
of
enforcing
this
statute
is
not
to
destroy
but
to
reconstruct
not
to
demolish
but
to
recreate
in
accordance
with
the
conditions
which
the
congress
has
declared
shall
exist
among
the
people
of
the
united
states
common
stock
ownership
it
has
been
assumed
that
the
present
pro
rata
and
common
ownership
in
all
these
companies
by
former
stockholders
of
the
trust
would
insure
a
continuance
of
the
same
old
single
control
of
all
the
companies
into
which
the
trust
has
by
decree
been
disintegrated
this
is
erroneous
and
is
based
upon
the
assumed
inefficacy
and
innocuousness
of
judicial
injunctions
the
companies
are
enjoined
from
cooperation
or
combination
they
have
different
managers
directors
purchasing
and
sales
agents
if
all
or
many
of
the
numerous
stockholders
reaching
into
the
thousands
attempt
to
secure
concerted
action
of
the
companies
with
a
view
to
the
control
of
the
market
their
number
is
so
large
that
such
an
attempt
could
not
well
be
concealed
and
its
prime
movers
and
all
its
participants
would
be
at
once
subject
to
contempt
proceedings
and
imprisonment
of
a
summary
character
the
immediate
result
of
the
present
situation
will
necessarily
be
activity
by
all
the
companies
under
different
managers
and
then
competition
must
follow
or
there
will
be
activity
by
one
company
and
stagnation
by
another
only
a
short
time
will
inevitably
lead
to
a
change
in
ownership
of
the
stock
as
all
opportunity
for
continued
cooperation
must
disappear
those
critics
who
speak
of
this
disintegration
in
the
trust
as
a
mere
change
of
garments
have
not
given
consideration
to
the
inevitable
working
of
the
decree
and
understand
little
the
personal
danger
of
attempting
to
evade
or
set
at
naught
the
solemn
injunction
of
a
court
whose
object
is
made
plain
by
the
decree
and
whose
inhibitions
are
set
forth
with
a
detail
and
comprehensiveness
voluntary
reorganizations
of
other
trusts
at
hand
the
effect
of
these
two
decisions
has
led
to
decrees
dissolving
the
combination
of
manufacturers
of
electric
lamps
a
southern
wholesale
grocers
association
an
interlocutory
decree
against
the
powder
trust
with
directions
by
the
circuit
court
compelling
dissolution
and
other
combinations
of
a
similar
history
are
now
negotiating
with
the
department
of
justice
looking
to
a
disintegration
by
decree
and
reorganization
in
accordance
with
law
it
seems
possible
to
bring
about
these
reorganizations
without
general
business
disturbance
movement
for
repeal
of
the
antitrust
law
but
now
that
the
antitrust
act
is
seen
to
be
effective
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
purpose
of
its
enactment
we
are
met
by
a
cry
from
many
different
quarters
for
its
repeal
it
is
said
to
be
obstructive
of
business
progress
to
be
an
attempt
to
restore
oldfashioned
methods
of
destructive
competition
between
small
units
and
to
make
impossible
those
useful
combinations
of
capital
and
the
reduction
of
the
cost
of
production
that
are
essential
to
continued
prosperity
and
normal
growth
in
the
recent
decisions
the
supreme
court
makes
clear
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
condemns
combinations
of
capital
or
mere
bigness
of
plant
organized
to
secure
economy
in
production
and
a
reduction
of
its
cost
it
is
only
when
the
purpose
or
necessary
effect
of
the
organization
and
maintenance
of
the
combination
or
the
aggregation
of
immense
size
are
the
stifling
of
competition
actual
and
potential
and
the
enhancing
of
prices
and
establishing
a
monopoly
that
the
statute
is
violated
mere
size
is
no
sin
against
the
law
the
merging
of
two
or
more
business
plants
necessarily
eliminates
competition
between
the
units
thus
combined
but
this
elimination
is
in
contravention
of
the
statute
only
when
the
combination
is
made
for
purpose
of
ending
this
particular
competition
in
order
to
secure
control
of
and
enhance
prices
and
create
a
monopoly
lack
of
definiteness
in
the
statute
the
complaint
is
made
of
the
statute
that
it
is
not
sufficiently
definite
in
its
description
of
that
which
is
forbidden
to
enable
business
men
to
avoid
its
violation
the
suggestion
is
that
we
may
have
a
combination
of
two
corporations
which
may
run
on
for
years
and
that
subsequently
the
attorney
general
may
conclude
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
that
which
was
supposed
by
the
combiners
to
be
innocent
then
turns
out
to
be
a
combination
in
violation
of
the
statute
the
answer
to
this
hypothetical
case
is
that
when
men
attempt
to
amass
such
stupendous
capital
as
will
enable
them
to
suppress
competition
control
prices
and
establish
a
monopoly
they
know
the
purpose
of
their
acts
men
do
not
do
such
a
thing
without
having
it
clearly
in
mind
if
what
they
do
is
merely
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
cost
of
production
without
the
thought
of
suppressing
competition
by
use
of
the
bigness
of
the
plant
they
are
creating
then
they
can
not
be
convicted
at
the
time
the
union
is
made
nor
can
they
be
convicted
later
unless
it
happen
that
later
on
they
conclude
to
suppress
competition
and
take
the
usual
methods
for
doing
so
and
thus
establish
for
themselves
a
monopoly
they
can
in
such
a
case
hardly
complain
if
the
motive
which
subsequently
is
disclosed
is
attributed
by
the
court
to
the
original
combination
new
remedies
suggested
much
is
said
of
the
repeal
of
this
statute
and
of
constructive
legislation
intended
to
accomplish
the
purpose
and
blaze
a
clear
path
for
honest
merchants
and
business
men
to
follow
it
may
be
that
such
a
plan
will
be
evolved
but
i
submit
that
the
discussions
which
have
been
brought
out
in
recent
days
by
the
fear
of
the
continued
execution
of
the
antitrust
law
have
produced
nothing
but
glittering
generalities
and
have
offered
no
line
of
distinction
or
rule
of
action
as
definite
and
as
clear
as
that
which
the
supreme
court
itself
lays
down
in
enforcing
the
statute
supplemental
legislation
needednot
repeal
or
amendment
i
see
no
objectionand
indeed
i
can
see
decided
advantagesin
the
enactment
of
a
law
w
hich
shall
describe
and
denounce
methods
of
competition
which
are
unfair
and
are
badges
of
the
unlawful
purpose
denounced
in
the
antitrust
law
the
attempt
and
purpose
to
suppress
a
competitor
by
underselling
him
at
a
price
so
unprofitable
as
to
drive
him
out
of
business
or
the
making
of
exclusive
contracts
with
customers
under
which
they
are
required
to
give
up
association
with
other
manufacturers
and
numerous
kindred
methods
for
stifling
competition
and
effecting
monopoly
should
be
described
with
sufficient
accuracy
in
a
criminal
statute
on
the
one
hand
to
enable
the
government
to
shorten
its
task
by
prosecuting
single
misdemeanors
instead
of
an
entire
conspiracy
and
on
the
other
hand
to
serve
the
purpose
of
pointing
out
more
in
detail
to
the
business
community
what
must
be
avoided
federal
incorporation
recommended
in
a
special
message
to
congress
on
january
i
ventured
to
point
out
the
disturbance
to
business
that
would
probably
attend
the
dissolution
of
these
offending
trusts
i
said
but
such
an
investigation
and
possible
prosecution
of
corporations
whose
prosperity
or
destruction
affects
the
comfort
not
only
of
stockholders
but
of
millions
of
wage
earners
employees
and
associated
tradesmen
must
necessarily
tend
to
disturb
the
confidence
of
the
business
community
to
dry
up
the
now
flowing
sources
of
capital
from
its
places
of
hoarding
and
produce
a
halt
in
our
present
prosperity
that
will
cause
suffering
and
strained
circumstances
among
the
innocent
many
for
the
faults
of
the
guilty
few
the
question
which
i
wish
in
this
message
to
bring
clearly
to
the
consideration
and
discussion
of
congress
is
whether
in
order
to
avoid
such
a
possible
business
danger
something
can
not
be
done
by
which
these
business
combinations
may
be
offered
a
means
without
great
financial
disturbance
of
changing
the
character
organization
and
extent
of
their
business
into
one
within
the
lines
of
the
law
under
federal
control
and
supervision
securing
compliance
with
the
antitrust
statute
generally
in
the
industrial
combinations
called
trusts
the
principal
business
is
the
sale
of
goods
in
many
states
and
in
foreign
markets
in
other
words
the
interstate
and
foreign
business
far
exceeds
the
business
done
in
any
one
state
this
fact
will
justify
the
federal
government
in
granting
a
federal
charter
to
such
a
combination
to
make
and
sell
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
the
products
of
useful
manufacture
under
such
limitations
as
will
secure
a
compliance
with
the
antitrust
law
it
is
possible
so
to
frame
a
statute
that
while
it
offers
protection
to
a
federal
company
against
harmful
vexatious
and
unnecessary
invasion
by
the
states
it
shall
subject
it
to
reasonable
taxation
and
control
by
the
states
with
respect
to
its
purely
local
business
corporations
organized
under
this
act
should
be
prohibited
from
acquiring
and
holding
stock
in
other
corporations
except
for
special
reasons
upon
approval
by
the
proper
federal
authority
thus
avoiding
the
creation
under
national
auspices
of
the
holding
company
with
subordinate
corporations
in
different
states
which
has
been
such
an
effective
agency
in
the
creation
of
the
great
trusts
and
monopolies
if
the
prohibition
of
the
antitrust
act
against
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
is
to
be
effectively
enforced
it
is
essential
that
the
national
government
shall
provide
for
the
creation
of
national
corporations
to
carry
on
a
legitimate
business
throughout
the
united
states
the
conflicting
laws
of
the
different
states
of
the
union
with
respect
to
foreign
corporations
make
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
one
corporation
to
comply
with
their
requirements
so
as
to
carry
on
business
in
a
number
of
different
states
i
renew
the
recommendation
of
the
enactment
of
a
general
law
providing
for
the
voluntary
formation
of
corporations
to
engage
in
trade
and
commerce
among
the
states
and
with
foreign
nations
every
argument
which
was
then
advanced
for
such
a
law
and
every
explanation
which
was
at
that
time
offered
to
possible
objections
have
been
confirmed
by
our
experience
since
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
statute
has
resulted
in
the
actual
dissolution
of
active
commercial
organizations
it
is
even
more
manifest
now
than
it
was
then
that
the
denunciation
of
conspiracies
in
restraint
of
trade
should
not
and
does
not
mean
the
denial
of
organizations
large
enough
to
be
intrusted
with
our
interstate
and
foreign
trade
it
has
been
made
more
clear
now
than
it
was
then
that
a
purely
negative
statute
like
the
antitrust
law
may
well
be
supplemented
by
specific
provisions
for
the
building
up
and
regulation
of
legitimate
national
and
foreign
commerce
government
administrative
experts
needed
to
aid

the
drafting
of
the
decrees
in
the
dissolution
of
the
present
trusts
with
a
view
to
their
reorganization
into
legitimate
corporations
has
made
it
especially
apparent
that
the
courts
are
not
provided
with
the
administrative
machinery
to
make
the
necessary
inquiries
preparatory
to
reorganization
or
to
pursue
such
inquiries
and
they
should
be
empowered
to
invoke
the
aid
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
in
determining
the
suitable
reorganization
of
the
disintegrated
parts
the
circuit
court
and
the

general

greatly
aided
in
framing
the
decree
in
the

by
an
expert
from
the
bureau
of

federal
corporation
commission
proposed
i
do
not
set
forth
in
detail
the
terms
and
sections
of
a
statute
which
might
supply
the
constructive
legislation
permitting
and
aiding
the
formation
of
combinations
of
capital
into
federal
corporations
they
should
be
subject
to
rigid
rules
as
to
their
organization
and
procedure
including
effective
publicity
and
to
the
closest
supervision
as
to
the
issue
of
stock
and
bonds
by
an
executive
bureau
or
commission
in
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
to
which
in
times
of
doubt
they
might
well
submit
their
proposed
plans
for
future
business
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
incorporation
under
federal
law
could
not
exempt
the
company
thus
formed
and
its
incorporators
and
managers
from
prosecution
under
the
antitrust
law
for
subsequent
illegal
conduct
but
the
publicity
of
its
procedure
and
the
opportunity
for
frequent
consultation
with
the
bureau
or
commission
in
charge
of
the
incorporation
as
to
the
legitimate
purpose
of
its
transactions
would
offer
it
as
great
security
against
successful
prosecutions
for
violations
of
the
law
as
would
be
practical
or
wise
such
a
bureau
or
commission
might
well
be
invested
also
with
the
duty
already
referred
to
of
aiding
courts
in
the
dissolution
and
recreation
of
trusts
within
the
law
it
should
be
an
executive
tribunal
of
the
dignity
and
power
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
now
exercise
supervisory
power
over
important
classes
of
corporations
under
federal
regulation
the
drafting
of
such
a
federal
incorporation
law
would
offer
ample
opportunity
to
prevent
many
manifest
evils
in
corporate
management
today
including
irresponsibility
of
control
in
the
hands
of
the
few
who
are
not
the
real
owners
incorporation
voluntary
i
recommend
that
the
federal
charters
thus
to
be
granted
shall
be
voluntary
at
least
until
experience
justifies
mandatory
provisions
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
the
operation
of
great
businesses
under
the
protection
of
such
a
charter
would
attract
all
who
are
anxious
to
keep
within
the
lines
of
the
law
other
large
combinations
that
fail
to
take
advantage
of
the
federal
incorporation
will
not
have
a
right
to
complain
if
their
failure
is
ascribed
to
unwillingness
to
submit
their
transactions
to
the
careful
official
scrutiny
competent
supervision
and
publicity
attendant
upon
the
enjoyment
of
such
a
charter
only
supplemental
legislation
needed
the
opportunity
thus
suggested
for
federal
incorporation
it
seems
tome
is
suitable
constructive
legislation
needed
to
facilitate
the
squaring
of
great
industrial
enterprises
to
the
rule
of
action
laid
down
by
the
antitrust
law
this
statute
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
must
continue
to
be
the
line
of
distinction
for
legitimate
business
it
must
be
enforced
unless
we
are
to
banish
individualism
from
all
business
and
reduce
it
to
one
common
system
of
regulation
or
control
of
prices
like
that
which
now
prevails
with
respect
to
public
utilities
and
which
when
applied
to
all
business
would
be
a
long
step
toward
state
socialism
importance
of
the
antitrust
act
the
antitrust
act
is
the
expression
of
the
effort
of
a
freedomloving
people
to
preserve
equality
of
opportunity
it
is
the
result
of
the
confident
determination
of
such
a
people
to
maintain
their
future
growth
by
preserving
uncontrolled
and
unrestricted
the
enterprise
of

his

his
independent
courage
for
twenty
years

more
this
statute
has
been
upon
the
statute
book
all
knew
its
general
purpose
and
approved
many
of
its
violators
were
cynical
over
its
assumed
impotence
it
seemed
impossible
of
enforcement
slowly
the
mills
of
the
courts

and
only
gradually
did
the
majesty
of

assert
itself
many
of
its

died
before
it
became
a
living
force
and
they
and
others
saw
the
evil
grow
which
they
had
hoped
to
destroy
now
its
efficacy
is
seen
now
its
power
is
heavy
now
its
object
is
near
achievement
now
we
hear
the
call
for
its
repeal
on
the
plea
that
it
interferes
with
business
prosperity
and
we
are
advised
in
most
general
terms
how
by
some
other
statute
and
in
some
other
way
the
evil
we
are
just
stamping
out
can
be
cured
if
we
only
abandon
this
work
of
twenty
years
and
try
another
experiment
for
another
term
of
years
it
is
said
that
the

not
done
good
can
this
be
said
in
the

did
it

for

even
though
exercised
under
the
general
supervision
of
an
interstate
commission
do
we
desire
to
make
such
ruthless
combinations
and
monopolies
lawful
when
all
energies
are
directed
not
toward
the
reduction
of
the
cost
of

for
the
public
benefit
by

healthful

toward
new

the
absolute
control
of
the

prevailing
in
the
whole

the

just
passed
marks
an
important
general
movement
on
the
part

benefits
to
mankind
in
the
extension

the
policy
of

in

widespread
demand
for

advance
in

direction
on
the
part
of
the
people
of

and

and

new
arbitration
treaties
were
negotiated
last
spring
with
great
britain
and
france
the
terms
of
which
were
de
signed
as
expressed
in
the
preamble
of
these
treaties
to
extend
the
scope
and
obligations
of
the
policy
of
arbitration
adopted
in
our
present
treaties
with
those
governments
to
pave
the
way
for
this
treat

great

negotiated

also
expedited
the
negotiations
with

the
new

claim

i
am
glad
to
report
that
on
july
last
the
american
claim
of
alsop
co
against
the
government
of
chile
was
finally
disposed
of
by
the
decision
of
his
britannic
majesty
george
v
to
whom
as
amiable
compositeur
the
matter
had
been
referred
for
determination
his
majesty
made
an
award
of
nearly
to
the
claimants
which
was
promptly
paid
by
chile
the
settlement
of
this
controversy
has
happily
eliminated
from
the
relations
between
the
republic
of
chile
and
the
united
states
the
only
question
which
for
two
decades
had
given
the
two
foreign
offices
any
serious
concern
and
makes
possible
the
unobstructed
development
of
the
relations
of
friendship
which
it
has
been
the
aim
of
this
government
in
every
possible
way
to
further
and
cultivate
arbitrationspanama
and
costa
ricacolombia
and
haiti
in
further
illustration
of
the
practical
and
beneficent
application
of
the
principle
of
arbitration
and
the
underlying
broad
spirit
of
conciliation
i
am
happy
to
advert
to
the
part
of
the
united
states
in
facilitating
amicable
settlement
of
disputes
which
menaced
the
peace
between
panama
and
costa
rica
and
between
haiti
and
the
dominican
republic
since
the
date
of
their
independence
colombia
and
costa
rica
had
been
seeking
a
solution
of
a
boundary
dispute
which
came
as
an
heritage
from
colombia
to
the
new
republic
of
panama
upon
its
beginning
life
as
an
independent
nation
although
the
disputants
had
submitted
this
question
for
decision
to
the
president
of
france
under
the
terms
of
an
arbitration
treaty
the
exact
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
award
rendered
had
been
a
matter
of
serious
disagreement
between
the
two
countries
both
contending
for
widely
different
lines
even
under
the
terms
of
the
decision
subsequently
and
since
this
boundary
question
had
been
the
subject
of
fruitless
diplomatic
negotiations
between
the
parties
in
january
at
the
request
of
both
governments
the
agents
representing
them
met
in
conference
at
the
department
of
state
and
subsequently
concluded
a
protocol
submitting
this
longpending
controversy
to
the
arbitral
judgment
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
who
consented
to
act
in
this
capacity
a
boundary
commission
according
to
the
international
agreement
has
now
been
appointed
and
it
is
expected
that
the
arguments
will
shortly
proceed
and
that
this
longstanding
dispute
will
be
honorably
and
satisfactorily
terminated
again
a
few
months
ago
it
appeared
that
the
dominican
republic
and
haiti
were
about
to
enter
upon
hostilities
because
of
complications
growing
out
of
an
acrimonious
boundary
dispute
which
the
efforts
of
many
years
had
failed
to
solve
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
a
friendly
interposition
of
good
offices
succeeded
in
prevailing
upon
the
parties
to
place
their
reliance
upon
some
form
of
pacific
settlement
accordingly
on
the
friendly
suggestion
of
this
government
the
two
governments
empowered
commissioners
to
meet
at
washington
in
conference
at
the
state
department
in
order
to
arrange
the
terms
of
submission
to
arbitration
of
the
boundary
controversy
chamizal
arbitration
not
satisfactory
our
arbitration
of
the
chamizal
boundary
question
with
mexico
was
unfortunately
abortive
but
with
the
earnest
efforts
on
the
part
of
both
governments
which
its
importance
commands
it
is
felt
that
an
early
practical
adjustment
should
prove
possible
latin
america
venezuela
during
the
past
year
the
republic
of
venezuela
celebrated
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
its
independence
the
united
states
sent
in
honor
of
this
event
a
special
embassy
to
caracas
where
the
cordial
reception
and
generous
hospitality
shown
it
were
most
gratifying
as
a
further
proof
of
the
good
relations
and
friendship
existing
between
that
country
and
the
united
states
mexico
the
recent
political
events
in
mexico
received
attention
from
this
government
because
of
the
exceedingly
delicate
and
difficult
situation
created
along
our
southern
border
and
the
necessity
for
taking
measures
properly
to
safeguard
american
interests
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
its
desire
to
secure
a
proper
observance
and
enforcement
of
the
socalled
neutrality
statutes
of
the
federal
government
issued
directions
to
the
appropriate
officers
to
exercise
a
diligent
and
vigilant
regard
for
the
requirements
of
such
rules
and
laws
although
a
condition
of
actual
armed
conflict
existed
there
was
no
official
recognition
of
belligerency
involving
the
technical
neutrality
obligations
of
international
law
on
the
th
of
march
last
in
the
absence
of
the
secretary
of
state
i
had
a
personal
interview
with
mr
wilson
the
ambassador
of
the
united
states
to
mexico
in
which
he
reported
to
me
that
the
conditions
in
mexico
were
much
more
critical
than
the
press
dispatches
disclosed
that
president
diaz
was
on
a
volcano
of
popular
uprising
that
the
small
outbreaks
which
had
occurred
were
only
symptomatic
of
the
whole
condition
that
a
very
large
per
cent
of
the
people
were
in
sympathy
with
the
insurrection
that
a
general
explosion
was
probable
at
any
time
in
which
case
he
feared
that
the
or
more
american
residents
in
mexico
might
be
assailed
and
that
the
very
large
american
investments
might
be
injured
or
destroyed
after
a
conference
with
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
i
thought
it
wise
to
assemble
an
army
division
of
full
strength
at
san
antonio
tex
a
brigade
of
three
regiments
at
galveston
a
brigade
of
infantry
in
the
los
angeles
district
of
southern
california
together
with
a
squadron
of
battleships
and
cruisers
and
transports
at
galveston
and
a
small
squadron
of
ships
at
san
diego
at
the
same
time
through
our
representative
at
the
city
of
mexico
i
expressed
to
president
diaz
the
hope
that
no
apprehensions
might
result
from
unfounded
conjectures
as
to
these
military
maneuvers
and
assured
him
that
they
had
no
significance
which
should
cause
concern
to
his
government
the
mobilization
was
effected
with
great
promptness
and
on
the
th
of
march
through
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
chief
of
staff
i
issued
the
following
instructions
it
seems
my
duty
as
commander
in
chief
to
place
troops
in
sufficient
number
where
if
congress
shall
direct
that
they
enter
mexico
to
save
american
lives
and
property
an
effective
movement
may
be
promptly
made
meantime
the
movement
of
the
troops
to
texas
and
elsewhere
near
the
boundary
accompanied
with
sincere
assurances
of
the
utmost
goodwill
toward
the
present
mexican
government
and
with
larger
and
more
frequent
patrols
along
the
border
to
prevent
insurrectionary
expeditions
from
american
soil
will
hold
up
the
hands
of
the
existing
government
and
will
have
a
healthy
moral
effect
to
prevent
attacks
upon
americans
and
their
property
in
any
subsequent
general
internecine
strife
again
the
sudden
mobilization
of
a
division
of
troops
has
been
a
great
test
of
our
army
and
full
of
useful
instruction
while
the
maneuvers
that
are
thus
made
possible
can
occupy
the
troops
and
their
officers
to
great
advantage
the
assumption
by
the
press
that
i
contemplate
intervention
on
mexican
soil
to
protect
american
lives
or
property
is
of
course
gratuitous
because
i
seriously
doubt
whether
i
have
such
authority
under
any
circumstances
and
if
i
had
i
would
not
exercise
it
without
express
congressional
approval
indeed
as
you
know
i
have
already
declined
without
mexican
consent
to
order
a
troop
of
cavalry
to
protect
the
breakwater
we
are
constructing
just
across
the
border
in
mexico
at
the
mouth
of
the
colorado
river
to
save
the
imperial
valley
although
the
insurrectos
had
scattered
the
mexican
troops
and
were
taking
our
horses
and
supplies
and
frightening
our
workmen
away
my
determined
purpose
however
is
to
be
in
a
position
so
that
when
danger
to
american
lives
and
property
in
mexico
threatens
and
the
existing
government
is
rendered
helpless
by
the
insurrection
i
can
promptly
execute
congressional
orders
to
protect
them
with
effect
meantime
i
send
you
this
letter
through
the
secretary
to
call
your
attention
to
some
things
in
connection
with
the
prese
nce
of
the
division
in
the
southwest
which
have
doubtless
occurred
to
you
but
which
i
wish
to
emphasize
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
make
the
mobilization
a
firstclass
training
for
the
army
and
i
wish
you
would
give
your
time
and
that
of
the
war
college
to
advising
and
carrying
out
maneuvers
of
a
useful
character
and
plan
to
continue
to
do
this
during
the
next
three
months
by
that
time
we
may
expect
that
either
ambassador
wilsons
fears
will
have
been
realized
and
chaos
and
its
consequences
have
ensued
or
that
the
present
government
of
mexico
will
have
so
readjusted
matters
as
to
secure
tranquillitya
result
devoutly
to
be
wished
the
troops
can
then
be
returned
to
their
posts
i
understood
from
you
in
washington
that
gen
aleshire
said
that
you
could
probably
meet
all
the
additional
expense
of
this
whole
movement
out
of
the
present
appropriations
if
the
troops
continue
in
texas
for
three
months
i
sincerely
hope
this
is
so
i
observe
from
the
newspapers
that
you
have
no
blank
cartridges
but
i
presume
that
this
is
an
error
or
that
it
will
be
easy
to
procure
those
for
use
as
soon
as
your
maneuvers
begin
second
texas
is
a
state
ordinarily
peaceful
but
you
can
not
put
troops
into
it
without
running
some
risk
of
a
collision
between
the
people
of
that
state
and
especially
the
mexicans
who
live
in
texas
near
the
border
and
who
sympathize
with
the
insurrectos
and
the
federal
soldiers
for
that
reason
i
beg
you
to
be
as
careful
as
you
can
to
prevent
friction
of
any
kind
we
were
able
in
cuba
with
the
army
of
pacification
there
of
something
more
than
troops
to
maintain
them
for
a
year
without
any
trouble
and
i
hope
you
can
do
the
same
thing
in
texas
please
give
your
attention
to
this
and
advise
all
the
officers
in
command
of
the
necessity
for
very
great
circumspection
in
this
regard
third
one
of
the
great
troubles
in
the
concentration
of
troops
is
the
danger
of
disease
and
i
suppose
that
you
have
adopted
the
most
modern
methods
for
preventing
and
if
necessary
for
stamping
out
epidemics
that
is
so
much
a
part
of
a
campaign
that
it
hardly
seems
necessary
for
me
to
call
attention
to
it
finally
i
wish
you
to
examine
the
question
of
the
patrol
of
the
border
and
put
as
many
troops
on
that
work
as
is
practicable
and
more
than
are
now
engaged
in
it
in
order
to
prevent
the
use
of
our
borderland
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
insurrection
i
have
given
assurances
to
the
mexican
ambassador
on
this
point
i
sincerely
hope
that
this
experience
will
always
be
remembered
by
the
army
and
navy
as
a
useful
means
of
education
and
i
should
be
greatly
disappointed
if
it
resulted
in
any
injury
or
disaster
to
our
forces
from
any
cause
i
have
taken
a
good
deal
of
responsibility
in
ordering
this
mobilization
but
i
am
ready
to
answer
for
it
if
only
you
and
those
under
you
use
the
utmost
care
to
avoid
the
difficulties
which
i
have
pointed
out
you
may
have
a
copy
of
this
letter
made
and
left
with
gen
carter
and
such
other
generals
in
command
as
you
may
think
wise
and
necessary
to
guide
them
in
their
course
but
to
be
regarded
as
confidential
i
am
more
than
happy
to
here
record
the
fact
that
all
apprehensions
as
to
the
effect
of
the
presence
of
so
large
a
military
force
in
texas
proved
groundless
no
disturbances
occurred
the
conduct
of
the
troops
was
exemplary
and
the
public
reception
and
treatment
of
them
was
all
that
could
have
been
desired
and
this
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
mexican
refugees
in
the
border
territory
from
time
to
time
communications
were
received
from
ambassador
wilson
who
had
returned
to
mexico
confirming
the
view
that
the
massing
of
american
troops
in
the
neighborhood
had
had
good
effect
by
dispatch
of
april
the
ambassador
said
the
continuing
gravity
of
the
situation
here
and
the
chaos
that
would
ensue
should
the
constitutional
authorities
be
eventually
overthrown
thus
greatly
increasing
the
danger
to
which
american
lives
and
property
are
already
subject
confirm
the
wisdom
of
the
president
in
taking
those
military
precautions
which
making
every
allowance
for
the
dignity
and
the
sovereignty
of
a
friendly
state
are
due
to
our
nationals
abroad
charged
as
i
am
with
the
responsibility
of
safeguarding
these
lives
and
property
i
am
bound
to
say
to
the
department
that
our
military
dispositions
on
the
frontier
have
produced
an
effective
impression
on
the
mexican
mind
and
may
at
any
moment
prove
to
be
the
only
guaranties
for
the
safety
of
our
nationals
and
their
property
if
it
should
eventuate
that
conditions
here
require
more
active
measures
by
the
president
and
congress
sporadic
attacks
might
be
made
upon
the
lives
and
property
of
our
nationals
but
the
ultimate
result
would
be
order
and
adequate
protection
the
insurrection
continued
and
resulted
in
engagements
between
the
regular
mexican
troops
and
the
insurgents
and
this
along
the
border
so
that
in
several
instances
bullets
from
the
contending
forces
struck
american
citizens
engaged
in
their
lawful
occupations
on
american
soil
proper
protests
were
made
against
these
invasions
of
american
rights
to
the
mexican
authorities
on
april
i
received
the
following
telegram
from
the
governor
of
arizona
as
a
result
of
todays
fighting
across
the
international
line
but
within
gunshot
range
of
the
heart
of
douglas
five
americans
wounded
on
this
side
of
the
line
everything
points
to
repetition
of
these
casualties
on
tomorrow
and
while
the
federals
seem
disposed
to
keep
their
agreement
not
to
fire
into
douglas
the
position
of
the
insurrectionists
is
such
that
when
fighting
occurs
on
the
east
and
southeast
of
the
intrenchments
people
living
in
douglas
are
put
in
danger
of
their
lives
in
my
judgment
radical
measures
are
needed
to
protect
our
innocent
people
and
if
anything
can
be
done
to
stop
the
fighting
at
agua
prieta
the
situation
calls
for
such
action
it
is
impossible
to
safeguard
the
people
of
douglas
unless
the
town
be
vacated
can
anything
be
done
to
relieve
situation
now
acute
after
a
conference
with
the
secretary
of
state
the
following
telegram
was
sent
to
governor
sloan
on
april
is
and
made
public
your
dispatch
received
have
made
urgent
demand
upon
mexican
government
to
issue
instructions
to
prevent
firing
across
border
by
mexican
federal
troops
and
am
waiting
reply
meantime
i
have
sent
direct
warning
to
the
mexican
and
insurgent
forces
near
douglas
i
infer
from
your
dispatch
that
both
parties
attempt
to
heed
the
warning
but
that
in
the
strain
and
exigency
of
the
contest
wild
bullets
still
find
their
way
into
douglas
the
situation
might
justify
me
in
ordering
our
troops
to
cross
the
border
and
attempt
to
stop
the
fighting
or
to
fire
upon
both
combatants
from
the
american
side
but
if
i
take
this
step
i
must
face
the
possibility
of
resistance
and
greater
bloodshed
and
also
the
danger
of
having
our
motives
misconstrued
and
misrepresented
and
of
thus
inflaming
mexican
popular
indignation
against
many
thousand
americans
now
in
mexico
and
jeopardizing
their
lives
and
property
the
pressure
for
general
intervention
under
such
conditions
it
might
not
be
practicable
to
resist
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
or
reckon
the
consequences
of
such
a
course
and
we
must
use
the
greatest
selfrestraint
to
avoid
it
pending
my
urgent
representation
to
the
mexican
government
i
can
not
therefore
order
the
troops
at
douglas
to
cross
the
border
but
i
must
ask
you
and
the
local
authorities
in
case
the
same
danger
recurs
to
direct
the
people
of
douglas
to
place
themselves
where
bullets
can
not
reach
them
and
thus
avoid
casualty
i
am
loath
to
endanger
americans
in
mexico
where
they
are
necessarily
exposed
by
taking
a
radical
step
to
prevent
injury
to
americans
on
our
side
of
the
border
who
can
avoid
it
by
a
temporary
inconvenience
i
am
glad
to
say
that
no
further
invasion
of
american
rights
of
any
substantial
character
occurred
the
presence
of
a
large
military
and
naval
force
available
for
prompt
action
near
the
mexican
border
proved
to
be
most
fortunate
under
the
somewhat
trying
conditions
presented
by
this
invasion
of
american
rights
had
no
movement
theretofore
taken
place
and
because
of
these
events
it
had
been
necessary
then
to
bring
about
the
mobilization
it
must
have
had
sinister
significance
on
the
other
hand
the
presence
of
the
troops
before
and
at
the
time
of
the
unfortunate
killing
and
wounding
of
american
citizens
at
douglas
made
clear
that
the
restraint
exercised
by
our
government
in
regard
to
this
occurrence
was
not
due
to
lack
of
force
or
power
to
deal
with
it
promptly
and
aggressively
but
was
due
to
a
real
desire
to
use
every
means
possible
to
avoid
direct
intervention
in
the
affairs
of
our
neighbor
whose
friendship
we
valued
and
were
most
anxious
to
retain
the
policy
and
action
of
this
government
were
based
upon
an
earnest
friendliness
for
the
mexican
people
as
a
whole
and
it
is
a
matter
of
gratification
to
note
that
this
attitude
of
strict
impartiality
as
to
all
factions
in
mexico
and
of
sincere
friendship
for
the
neighboring
nation
without
regard
for
party
allegiance
has
been
generally
recognized
and
has
resulted
in
an
even
closer
and
more
sympathetic
understanding
between
the
two
republics
and
a
warmer
regard
one
for
the
other
action
to
suppress
violence
and
restore
tranquillity
throughout
the
mexican
republic
was
of
peculiar
interest
to
this
government
in
that
it
concerned
the
safeguarding
of
american
life
and
property
in
that
country
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
occasion
to
accord
permission
for
the
passage
of
a
body
of
mexican
rurales
through

a

has
been
unearthe
d
against
the
present

to
begin
a
new
insurrection
pursuing
the
same
consistent
policy
which
this
administration
has
adopted
from
the
beginning
it
directed
an
investigation
into
the
conspiracy
charged
and
this
investigation
has
resulted
in
the
indictment
of
gen
bernardo

and
others
and
the
seizure
of
a
number
of
officers
and
men
and
horses
and
accoutrements
assembled
upon
the
soil
of
texas
for
the
purpose
of

similar
proceedings
had
been
taken
during

of
persons
found
to
be
engaged
in
violating

of

in

of

the
record
of

in

of
the
recognition

authority
in

therefore
is
clear
central
americahonduras

nicaragua
treaties
proposed
as
to
the
situation
in
central
america
i
have
taken
occasion
in
the
past
to
emphasize
most
strongly
the
importance
that
should
be
attributed
to
the
consummation
of
the
conventions
between
the
republics
of
nicaragua
and
of
honduras
and
this
country
and
i
again
earnestly
recommend
that
the
necessary
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
be
accorded
to
these
treaties
which
will
make
it
possible
for
these
central
american
republics
to
enter
upon
an
era
of
genuine
economic
national
development
the
government
of
nicaragua
which
has
already
taken
favorable
action
on
the
convention
has
found
it
necessary
pending
the
exchange
of
final
ratifications
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
american
bankers
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
temporary
loan
to
relieve
the
present
financial
tension
iii
connection
with
this
temporary
loan
and
in
the
hope
of
consummating
through
the
ultimate
operation
of
the
convention
a
complete
and
lasting
economic
regeneration
the
government
of
nicaragua
has
also
decided
to
engage
an
american
citizen
as
collector
general
of
customs
the
claims
commission
on
which
the
services
of
two
american
citizens
have
been
sought
and
the
work
of
the
american
financial
adviser
should
accomplish
a
lasting
good
of
inestimable
benefit
to
the
prosperity
commerce
and
peace
of
the
republic
in
considering
the
ratification
of
the
conventions
with
nicaragua
and
honduras
there
rests
with
the
united
states
the
heavy
responsibility
of
the
fact
that
their
rejection
here
might
destroy
the
progress
made
and
consign
the
republics
concerned
to
still
deeper
submergence
in
bankruptcy

national
jeopardy

the

in

by

conclusion
of
two
important
international
loans
one
for
the

the

for

to
which

was

by

with

great
britain
and
japan
of
which
mention
was
made
in
my
last
annual
message
it
will
be
remembered
that
early
in
an
agreement
was
consummated
among
british
french
and
german
financial
groups
whereby
they
proposed
to
lend
the
chinese
government
funds
for
the
construction
of
railways
in
the
provinces
of
hunan
and
hupeh
reserving
for
their
nationals
the
privilege
of
engineering
the
construction
of
the
lines
and
of
furnishing
the
materials
required
for
the
work
after
negotiations
with
the
governments
and
groups
concerned
an
agreement
was
reached
whereby
american
british
french
and
german
nationals
should
participate
upon
equal
terms
in
this
important
and
useful
undertaking
thereupon
the
financial
groups
supported
by
their
respective
governments
began
negotiations
with
the
chinese
government
which
terminated
in
a
loan
to
china
of
with
the
privilege
of
increasing
the
amount
to
the
cooperative
construction
of
these
trunk
lines
should
be
of
immense
advantage
materially
and
otherwise
to
china
and
should
greatly
facilitate
the
development
of
the
bountiful
resources
of
the
empire
on
the
other
hand
a
large
portion
of
these
funds
is
to
be
expended
for
materials
american
products
having
equal
preference
with
those
of
the
other
three
lending
nations
and
as
the
contract
provides
for
branches
and
extensions
subsequently
to
be
built
on
the
same
terms
the
opportunities
for
american
materials
will
reach
considerable
proportions
knowing
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
reform
of
chinese
currency
the
chinese
government
in
the
autumn
of
sought
the
assistance
of
the
american
government
to
procure
funds
with
which
to
accomplish
that
allimportant
reform
in
the
course
of
the
subsequent
negotiations
there
was
combined
with
the
proposed
currency
loan
one
for
certain
industrial
developments
in
manchuria
the
two
loans
aggregating
the
sum
of
while
this
was
originally
to
be
solely
an
american
enterprise
the
american
government
consistently
with
its
desire
to
secure
a
sympathetic
and
practical
cooperation
of
the
great
powers
toward
maintaining
the
principle
of
equality

in

of
immense
importance
in
itself
the
reform
contemplated
in
making
this
loan
is
but
preliminary
to
other
and
more
comprehensive
fiscal
reforms
which
will
be
of
incalculable
benefit
to
china
and
foreign
interests
alike

was

with
the
reform
and
in
order
that
absolute
equality
in
all
respects
among
the

might
be
scrupulously
observed
the

incidental

traditional
policy
of

the
understanding

to

had
been
in
operation

entire
satisfaction
to

cause

anxiety
happily
appears
to
have
reached
a
stage
at
which
it
need
no
longer
be

the

occupied
for
a
period
by
strife
in

and
is
now
at
war

have
been
more

less
felt

been
the
scene
of
a
long
internal

these
conditions
have
been
the
cause
of
uneasiness
in
european
diplomacy
but
thus
far
without
direct
political
concern
to
the
united
states
in
the
war
which
unhappily
exists
between
italy
and
turkey
this
government
has
no
direct
political
interest
and
i
took
occasion
at
the
suitable
time
to
issue
a
proclamation
of
neutrality
in
that
conflict
at
the
same
time
all
necessary
steps
have
been
taken
to
safeguard
the

the

has
gained
markedly
in
its
commercial
standing
with
certain
of
the
nations
of
the
near
east
turkey
especially
is
beginning
to
come
into
closer
relations
with
the
united
states
through
the
new
interest
of
american
manufacturers
and
exporters
in
the
possibilities
of
those
regions
and
it
is
hoped
that
foundations
are
being
laid
for
a
large
and
mutually
beneficial
exchange
of
commodities
between
the
two
countries
this
new
interest
of
turkey
in
american
goods
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
a
party
of
prominent
merchants
from
a
large
city
in
turkey
recently
visited
the
united
states
to
study
conditions
of
manufacture
and
export
here
and
to
get
into
personal
touch
with
american
merchants
with
a
view
to
cooperating
more
intelligently
in
opening
up
the
markets
of
turkey
and
the
adjacent
countries
to
our
manufactures
another
indication
of
this
new
interest
of
america
in
the
commerce
of
the
near
east
is
the
recent
visit
of
a
large
party
of
american
merchants
and
manufacturers
to
central
and
eastern
europe
where
they
were
entertained
by
prominent
officials
and
organizations
of
the
large
cities
and
new
bonds
of
friendship
and
understanding
were
established
which
can
not
but
lead
to
closer
and
greater
commercial
interchange

a
number
of

have
been

nearly
all
of

them
of
any

have
either
been

arrangements
made

of

pecuniary

by

in

that
as
many
of

view
to

international
opium
commission
in
a
special
message
transmitted
to
the
congress
on
the
th
of
january
in
which
i
concurred
in
the
recommendations
made
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
regard
to
certain
needful
legislation
for
the
control
of
our
interstate
and
foreign
traffic
in
opium
and
other
menacing
drugs
i
quoted
from
my
annual
message
of
december
in
which
i
announced
that
the
results
of
the
international
opium
commission
held
at
shanghai
in
february
at
the
invitation
of
the
united
states
had
been
laid
before
this
government
that
the
report
of
that
commission
showed
that
china
was
making
remarkable
progress
and
admirable
efforts
toward
the
eradication
of
the
opium
evil
that
the
interested
governments
had
not
permitted
their
commercial
interests
to
prevent
their
cooperation
in
this
reform
and
as
a
result
of
collateral
investigations
of
the
opium
question
in
this
country
i
recommended
that
the
manufacture
sale
and
use
of
opium
in
the
united
states
should
be
more
rigorously
controlled
by
legislation
prior
to
that
time
and
in
continuation
of
the
policy
of
this
government
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
the
interested
nations
the
united
states
proposed
an
international
opium
conference
with
full
powers
for
the
purpose
of
clothing
with
the
force
of
international
law
the
resolutions
adopted
by
the
abovementioned
commission
together
with
their
essential
corollaries
the
other
powers
concerned
cordially
responded
to
the
proposal
of
this
government
and
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
announce
representatives
of
all
the
powers
assembled
in
conference
at
the
hague
on
the
first
of
this
month
since
the
passage
of
the
opiumexclusion
act
more
than
twenty
states
have
been
animated
to
modify
their
pharmacy
laws
and
bring
them
in
accord
with
the
spirit
of
that
act
thus
stamping
out
to
a
measure
the
intrastate
traffic
in
opium
and
other
habitforming
drugs
but
although
i
have
urged
on
the
congress
the
passage
of
certain
measures
for
federal
control
of
the
interstate
and
foreign
traffic
in
these
drugs
no
action
has
yet
been
taken
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
now
sitting
at
the
hague
so
important
a
conference
which
has
under
review
the
municipal
laws
of
the
different
nations
for
the
mitigation
of
their
opium
and
other
allied
evils
a
conference
which
will
certainly
deal
with
the
international
aspects
of
these
evils
it
seems
to
me
most
essential
that
the
congress
should
take
immediate
action
on
the
antinarcotic
legislation
to
which
i
have
already
called
attention
by
a
special

of

entered
into
on

of

between
the

and

for
the
repression
of
the
circulation
of

foreign

relations
of
the

in
my
last
annual
message
i
referred
to
the
tariff
negotiations
of
the
department
of
state
with
foreign
countries
in
connection
with
the
application
by
a
series
of
proclamations
of
the
minimum
tariff
of
the
united
states
to
importations
from
the
several
countries
and
i
stated
that
in
its
general
operation
section
of
the
new
tariff
law
had
proved
a
guaranty
of
continued
commercial
peace
although
there
were
unfortunately
instances
where
foreign
governments
dealt
arbitrarily
with
american
interests
within
their
jurisdiction
in
a
manner
injurious
and
inequitable
during
the
past
year
some
instances
of
discriminatory
treatment
have
been
removed
but
i
regret
to
say
that
there
remain
a
few
cases
of
differential
treatment
adverse
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
while
none
of
these
instances
now
appears
to
amount
to
undue
discrimination
in
the
sense
of
section
of
the
tariff
law
of
august
they
are
all
exceptions
to
that
complete
degree
of
equality
of
tariff
treatment
that
the
department
of
state
has
consistently
sought
to
obtain
for
american
commerce
abroad
while
the
double
tariff
feature
of
the
tariff
law
of
has
been
amply
justified
by
the
results
achieved
in
removing
former
and
preventing
new
undue
discriminations
against
american
commerce
it
is
believed
that
the
time
has
come
for
the
amendment
of
this
feature
of
the
law
in
such
way
as
to
provide
a
graduated
means
of
meeting
varying
degrees
of
discriminatory
treatment
of
american
commerce
in
foreign
countries
as
well
as
to
protect
the
financial
interests
abroad
of
american
citizens
against
arbitrary
and
injurious
treatment
on
the
part
of
foreign
governments
through
either
legislative
or
administrative
measures
it
would
seem
desirable
that
the
maximum
tariff
of
the
united
states
should
embrace
within
its
purview
the
free
list
which
is
not
the
case
at
the
present
time
in
order
that
it
might
have
reasonable
significance
to
the
governments
of
those
countries
from
which
the
importations
into
the
united
states
are
confined
virtually
to
articles
on
the

of

amount
of

the
fiscal
year
ended

shows
great
progress
in
the
development
of
american
trade
it
was
noteworthy
as
marking
the
highest
record
of
exports
of
american
products
to
foreign
countries
the
valuation
being
in
excess
of
these

showed
a

more
than

while

visit
the
principal

of
the

have
been
found
of
great
value
these
trade
conferences
are
regarded
as
a
particularly
promising
method
of
governmental
aid
in
foreign
trade
promotion
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
has
arranged
to
give
publicity
to
the
expected
arrival
and
the
itinerary
of
consular
officers
and
commercial
agents
while
on
leave
in
the
united
states
in
order
that
trade
organizations
may
arrange
for
conferences
with
them
as
i
have
indicated
it
is
increasingly
clear
that
to
obtain
and
maintain
that
equity
and
substantial
equality
of
treatment
essential
to
the
flourishing
foreign
trade
which
becomes
year
by
year
more
important
to
the
industrial
and
commercial
welfare
of
the
united

we
should
have
a
flexibility
of
tariff
sufficient
for
the
give
and

of

by
the
department
of

on
behalf
of
our
commerce
and
industry
crying
need
for

merchant
marine
i
need
hardly
reiterate
the
conviction
that
there
should
speedily
be
built
up
an
american
merchant
marine
this
is
necessary
to
assure
favorable
transportation
facilities
to
our
great
oceanborne
commerce
as
well
as
to
supplement
the

with
an
adequate
reserve

would
have
the
economic
advantage
of
keeping

of
the
vast
sums
now
paid

shipping
for
carrying
american
goods
all
the
great
commercial
nations

heavy
subsidies
to
their
merchant
marine
so
that
it
is
obvious
that
without
some
wise
aid
from
the
congress
the

must
lag
behind
in
the

in

as
broad
as
the

in
the

and
in
the
coordination

certain
unofficial

have
done
good
work
toward

it
is
cause
for
regret
however
that
the
great
number
of
such

and
the
comparative
lack
of

between
them
fails
to
secure
an
efficiency
commensurate
with

in

commercial
opportunities
supplementing
the
regular
published
consular
reports
some
central
organization
in
touch
with
associations
and

of

throughout
the
country
and
able
to
keep
purely
american
interests
in
closer
touch
with
different
phases
of
commercial
affairs
would
i
believe
be
of
great
value
such
organization
might
be
managed
by
a
committee
composed
of
a
small
number
of
those
now
actively
carrying
on
the
work
of
some
of
the
larger
associations
and
there
might
be
added
to
the
committee
as
members
ex
officio
one
or
two
officials
of
the
department
of
state
and
one
or
two
officials
from
the
department
of

and

and
representatives
of
the
appropriate
committees
of
congress
the
authority
and
success
of
such
an
organization
would

evidently
be
enhanced
if
the
congress
should
see
fit
to
prescribe
its
scope
and
organization
through
legislation
which
would
give
to
it
some
such
official
standing
as
that
for
example
of
the

with
these
factors
and
the
continuance
of
the
foreignservice
establishment
departmental
diplomatic
and
consular
upon
the
high
plane
where
it
has
been
placed
by
the
recent
reorganization
this
government
would
be
abreast
of
the
times
in
fostering
the
interests
of
its
foreign
trade
and
the
rest
must
be
left
to
the
energy
and
enterprise
of
our
business
men
improvement
of
the
foreign
service
the
entire
foreignservice
organization
is
being
improved
and
developed
with
especial
regard
to
the
requirements
of
the
commercial
interests
of
the
country
the
rapid
growth
of
our
foreign
trade
makes
it
of
the
utmost
importance
that
governmental
agencies
through
which
that
trade
is
to
be
aided
and
protected
should
possess
a
high
degree
of
efficiency
not
only
should
the
foreign
representatives
be
maintained
upon
a
generous
scale
in
so
far
as
salaries
and
establishments
are
concerned
but
the
selection
and
advancement
of
officers
should
be
definitely
and
permanently
regulated
by
law
so
that
the
service
shall
not
fail
to
attract
men
of
high
character
and
ability
the
experience
of
the
past
few
years
with
a
partial
application
of
civilservice
rules
to
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
leaves
no
doubt
in
my
mind
of
the
wisdom
of
a
wider
and
more
permanent
extension
of
those
principles
to
both
branches
of
the
foreign
service
the
men
selected
for
appointment
by
means
of
the
existing
executive
regulations
have
been
of
a
far
higher
average
of
intelligence
and
ability
than
the
men
appointed
before
the
regulations
were
promulgated
moreover
the
feeling
that
under
the
existing
rules
there
is
reasonable
hope
for
permanence
of
tenure
during
good
behavior
and
for
promotion
for
meritorious
service
has
served
to
bring
about
a
zealous
activity
in
the
interests
of
the
country
which
never
before
existed
or
could
exist
it
is
my
earnest
conviction
that
the
enactment
into
law
of
the
general
principles
of
the
existing
regulations
can
not
fail
to
effect
further
improvement
in
both
branches
of
the
foreign
service
by
providing
greater
inducement
for
young
men
of
character
and
ability
to
seek
a
career
abroad
in
the
service
of
the
government
and
an
incentive
to
those
already
in
the
service
to
put
forth
greater
efforts
to
attain
the
high
standards
which
the
successful
conduct
of
our
international
relations
and
commerce
requires
i
therefore
again
commend
to
the
favorable
action
of
the
congress
the
enactment
of
a
law
applying
to
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
the
principles
embodied
in
section
of
the
revised
statutes
of
the
united
states
in
the
civilservice
act
of
january
and
the
executive
orders
of
june
and
of
november
in
its
consideration
of
this
important
subject
i
desire
to
recall
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
the
very
favorable
report
made
on
the
lowden
bill
for
the
improvement
of
the
foreign
service
by
the
foreign
affairs
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
available
statistics
show
the
strictness
with
which
the
merit
system
has
been
applied
to
the
foreign
service
during
recent
years
and
the
absolute
nonpartisan
selection
of
consuls
and
diplomaticservice
secretaries
who
indeed
far
from
being
selected
with
any
view
to
political
consideration
have
actually
been
chosen
to
a
disproportionate
extent
from
states
which
would
have
been
unrepresented
in
the
foreign
service
under
the
system
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
is
now
permanently
obsolete
some
legislation
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
present
system
of
examinations
and
promotions
upon
merit
and
efficiency
would
be
of
greatest
value
to
our
commercial
and
international
interests
part
iii
the
white
house
december
to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
my
annual
message
to
congress
december
i
stated
that
under
section
of
the
act
of
august
i
had
appointed
a
tariff
board
of
three
members
to
cooperate
with
the
state
department
in
the
administration
of
the
maximum
and
minimum
clause
of
that
act
to
make
a
glossary
or
encyclopedia
of
the
existing
tariff
so
as
to
render
its
terms
intelligible
to
the
ordinary
reader
and
then
to
investigate
industrial
conditions
and
costs
of
production
at
home
and
abroad
with
a
view
to
determining
to
what
extent
existing
tariff
rates
actually
exemplify
the
protective
principle
viz
that
duties
should
be
made
adequate
and
only
adequate
to
equalize
the
difference
in
cost
of
production
at
home
and
abroad
i
further
stated
that
i
believed
these
investigations
would
be
of
great
value
as
a
basis
for
accurate
legislation
and
that
i
should
from
time
to
time
recommend
to
congress
the
revision
of
certain
schedules
in
accordance
with
the
findings
of
the
board
in
the
last
session
of
the
sixtyfirst
congress
a
bill
creating
a
permanent
tariff
board
of
five
members
of
whom
not
more
than
three
should
be
of
the
same
political
party
passed
each
house
but
failed
of
enactment
because
of
slight
differences
on
which
agreement
was
not
reached
before
adjournment
an
appropriation
act
provided
that
the
permanent
tariff
board
if
created
by
statute
should
report
to
congress
on
schedule
k
in
december
therefore
to
carry
out
so
far
as
lay
within
my
power
the
purposes
of
this
bill
for
a
permanent
tariff
board
i
appointed
in
march
a
board
of
five
adding
two
members
of
such
party
affiliation
as
would
have
fulfilled
the
statutory
requirement
and
directed
them
to
make
a
report
to
me
on
schedule
k
of
the
tariff
act
in
december
of
this
year
in
my
message
of
august
accompanying
the
veto
of
the
wool
bill
i
said
that
in
my
judgment
schedule
k
should
be
revised
and
the
rates
reduced
my
veto
was
based
on
the
ground
that
since
the
tariff
board
would
make
in
december
a
detailed
report
on
wool
and
wool
manufactures
with
special
reference
to
the
relation
of
the
existing
rates
of
duties
to
relative
costs
here
and
abroad
public
policy
and
a
fair
regard
to
the
interests
of
the
producers
and
the
manufacturers
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
consumers
on
the
other
demanded
that
legislation
should
not
be
hastily
enacted
in
the
absence
of
such
information
that
i
was
not
myself
possessed
at
that
time
of
adequate
knowledge
of
the
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
proposed
act
was
in
accord
with
my
pledge
to
support
a
fair
and
reasonable
protective
policy
that
such
legislation
might
prove
only
temporary
and
inflict
upon
a
great
industry
the
evils
of
continued
uncertainty
i
now
herewith
submit
a
report
of
the
tariff
board
on
schedule
k
the
board
is
unanimous
in
its
findings
on
the
basis
of
these
findings
i
now
recommend
that
the
congress
proceed
to
a
consideration
of
this
schedule
with
a
view
to
its
revision
and
a
general
reduction
of
its
rates
the
report
shows
that
the
present
method
of
assessing
the
duty
on
raw
woolthis
is
by
a
specific
rate
on
the
grease
pound
i
e
unscoured
operates
to
exclude
wools
of
high
shrinkage
in
scouring
but
fine
quality
from
the
american
market
and
thereby
lessens
the
range
of
wools
available
to
the
domestic
manufacturer
that
the
duty
on
scoured
wool
of
cents
per
pound
is
prohibitory
and
operates
to
exclude
the
importation
of
clean
lowpriced
foreign
wools
of
inferior
grades
which
are
nevertheless
valuable
material
for
manufacturing
and
which
can
not
be
imported
in
the
grease
because
of
their
heavy
shrinkage
such
wools
if
imported
might
be
used
to
displace
the
cheap
substitutes
now
in
use
to
make
the
preceding
paragraph
a
little
plainer
take
the
instance
of
a
hundred
pounds
of
firstclass
wool
imported
under
the
present
duty
which
is
cents
a
pound
that
would
make
the
duty
on
the
hundred
pounds
the
merchantable
part
of
the
wool
thus
imported
is
the
weight
of
the
wool
of
this
hundred
pounds
after
scouring
if
the
wool
shrinks
per
cent
as
some
wools
do
then
the
duty
in
such
a
case
would
amount
to
on
pounds
of
scoured
wool
this
of
course
would
be
prohibitory
if
the
wool
shrinks
only
per
cent
it
would
be
on
pounds
of
wool
and
this
is
near
to
the
average
of
the
great
bulk
of
wools
that
are
imported
from
australia
which
is
the
principal
source
of
our
imported
wool
these
discriminations
could
be
overcome
by
assessing
a
duty
in
ad
valorem
terms
but
this
method
is
open
to
the
objection
first
that
it
increases
administrative
difficulties
and
tends
to
decrease
revenue
through
undervaluation
and
second
that
as
prices
advance
the
ad
valorem
rate
increases
the
duty
per
pound
at
the
time
when
the
consumer
most
needs
relief
and
the
producer
can
best
stand
competition
while
if
prices
decline
the
duty
is
decreased
at
the
time
when
the
consumer
is
least
burdened
by
the
price
and
the
producer
most
needs
protection
another
method
of
meeting
the
difficulty
of
taxing
the
grease
pound
is
to
assess
a
specific
duty
on
grease
wool
in
terms
of
its
scoured
content
this
obviates
the
chief
evil
of
the
present
system
namely
the
discrimination
due
to
different
shrinkages
and
thereby
tends
greatly
to
equalize
the
duty
the
board
reports
that
this
method
is
feasible
in
practice
and
could
be
administered
without
great
expense
the
scoured
content
of
the
wool
is
the
basis
on
which
users
of
wool
make
their
calculations
and
a
duty
of
this
kind
would
fit
the
usages
of
the
trade
one
effect
of
this
method
of
assessment
would
be
that
regardless
of
the
rate
of
duty
there
would
be
an
increase
in
the
supply
and
variety
of
wool
by
making
available
to
the
american
market
wools
of
both
low
and
fine
quality
now
excluded
the
report
shows
in
detail
the
difficulties
involved
in
attempting
to
state
in
categorical
terms
the
cost
of
wool
production
and
the
great
differences
in
cost
as
between
different
regions
and
different
types
of
wool
it
is
found
however
that
taking
all
varieties
in
account
the
average
cost
of
production
for
the
whole
american
clip
is
higher
than
the
cost
in
the
chief
competing
country
by
an
amount
somewhat
less
than
the
present
duty
the
report
shows
that
the
duties
on
wools
wool
wastes
and
shoddy
which
are
adjusted
to
the
rate
of
cents

on
scoured
wool
are
prohibitory
in
the
same
measure
that
the
duty
on
scoured
wool
is
prohibitory
in
general
they
are
assessed
at
rates
as
high
as
or
higher
than
the
duties
paid
on
the
clean
content
of
wools
actually
imported
they
should
be
reduced
and
so
adjusted
to
the
rate
on
wool
as
to
bear
their
proper
proportion
to
the
real
rate
levied
on
the
actual
wool
imports
the
duties
on
many
classes
of
wool
manufacture
are
prohibitory
and
greatly
in
excess
of
the
difference
in
cost
of
production
here
and
abroad
this
is
true
of
tops
of
yarns
with
the
exception
of
worsted
yarns
of
a
very
high
grade
and
of
low
and
medium
grade
cloth
of
heavy
weight
on
tops
up
to
cents
a
pound
in
value
and
on
yarns
of
cents
in
value
the
rate
is
per
cent
with
correspondingly
higher
rates
for
lower
values
on
cheap
and
medium
grade
cloths
the
existing
rates
frequently
run
to
per
cent
and
on
some
cheap
goods
to
over
per
cent
this
is
largely
due
to
that
part
of
the
duty
which
is
levied
ostensibly
to
compensate
the
manufacturer
for
the
enhanced
cost
of
his
raw
material
due
to
the
duty
on
wool
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
compensatory
duty
for
numerous
classes
of
goods
is
much
in
excess
of
the
amount
needed
for
strict
compensation
on
the
other
hand
the
findings
show
that
the
duties
which
run
to
such
high
ad
valorem
equivalents
are
prohibitory
since
the
goods
are
not
imported
but
that
the
prices
of
domestic
fabrics
are
not
raised
by
the
full
amount
of
duty
on
a
set
of
yard
samples
of
english
fabrics
which
are
completely
excluded
by
the
present
tariff
rates
it
was
found
that
the
total
foreign
value
was
the
duties
which
would
have
been
assessed
had
these
fabrics
been
imported
the
foreign
value
plus
the
amount
of
the
duty
or
a
nominal
duty
of
per
cent
in
fact
however
practically
identical
fabrics
of
domestic
make
sold
at
the
same
time
at
showing
an
enhanced
price
over
the
foreign
market
value
of
but
per
cent
although
these
duties
do
not
increase
prices
of
domestic
goods
by
anything
like
their
full
amount
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
such
prohibitive
duties
eliminate
the
possibility
of
foreign
competition
even
in
time
of
scarcity
that
they
form
a
temptation
to
monopoly
and
conspiracies
to
control
domestic
prices
that
they
are
much
in
excess
of
the
difference
in
cost
of
production
here
and
abroad
and
that
they
should
be
reduced
to
a
point
which
accords
with
this
principle
the
findings
of
the
board
show
that
in
this
industry
the
actual
manufacturing
cost
aside
from
the
question
of
the
price
of
materials
is
much
higher
in
this
country
than
it
is
abroad
that
in
the
making
of
yarn
and
cloth
the
domestic
woolen
or
worsted
manufacturer
has
in
general
no
advantage
in
the
form
of
superior
machinery
or
more
efficient
labor
to
offset
the
higher
wages
paid
in
this
country
the
findings
show
that
the
cost
of
turning
wool
into
yarn
in
this
country
is
about
double
that
in
the
leading
competing
country
and
that
the
cost
of
turning
yarn
into
cloth
is
somewhat
more
than
double
under
the
protective
policy
a
great
industry
involving
the
welfare
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
has
been
established
despite
these
handicaps
in
recommending
revision
and
reduction
i
therefore
urge
that
action
be
taken
with
these
facts
in
mind
to
the
end
that
an
important
and
established
industry
may
not
be
jeopardized
the
tariff
board
reports
that
no
equitable
method
has
been
found
to
levy
purely
specific
duties
on
woolen
and
worsted
fabrics
and
that
excepting
for
a
compensatory
duty
the
rate
must
be
ad
valorem
on
such
manufactures
it
is
important
to
realize
however
that
no
flat
ad
valorem
rate
on
such
fabrics
can
be
made
to
work
fairly
and
effectively
any
single
rate
which
is
high
enough
to
equalize
the
difference
in
manufacturing
cost
at
home
and
abroad
on
highly
finished
goods
involving
such
labor
would
be
prohibitory
on
cheaper
goods
in
which
the
labor
cost
is
a
smaller
proportion
of
the
total
value
conversely
a
rate
only
adequate
to
equalize
this
difference
on
cheaper
goods
would
remove
protection
from
the
finegoods
manufacture
the
increase
in
which
has
been
one
of
the
striking
features
of
the
trades
development
in
recent
years
i
therefore
recommend
that
in
any
revision
the
importance
of
a
graduated
scale
of
ad
valorem
duties
on
cloths
be
carefully
considered
and
applied
i
venture
to
say
that
no
legislative
body
has
ever
had
presented
to
it
a
more
complete
and
exhaustive
report
than
this
on
so
difficult
and
complicated
a
subject
as
the
relative
costs
of
wool
and
woolens
the
world
over
it
is
a
monument
to
the
thoroughness
industry
impartiality
and
accuracy
of
the
men
engaged
in
its
making
they
were
chosen
from
both
political
parties
but
have
allowed
no
partisan
spirit
to
prompt
or
control
their
inquiries
they
are
unanimous
in
their
findings
i
feel
sure
that
after
the
report
has
been
printed
and
studied
the
value
of
such
a
compendium
of
exact
knowledge
in
respect
to
this
schedule
of
the
tariff
will
convince
all
of
the
wisdom
of
making
such
a
board
permanent
in
order
that
it
may
treat
each
schedule
of
the
tariff
as
it
has
treated
this
and
then
keep
its
bureau
of
information
up
to
date
with
current
changes
in
the
economic
world
it
is
no
part
of
the
function
of
the
tariff
board
to
propose
rates
of
duty
their
function
is
merely
to
present
findings
of
fact
on
which
rates
of
duty
may
be
fairly
determined
in
the
light
of
adequate
knowledge
in
accord
with
the
economic
policy
to
be
followed
this
is
what
the
present
report
does
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
board
show
ample
reason
for
the
revision
downward
of
schedule
k
in
accord
with
the
protective
principle
and
present
the
data
as
to
relative
costs
and
prices
from
which
may
be
determined
what
rates
will
fairly
equalize
the
difference
in
production
costs
i
recommend
that
such
revision
be
proceeded
with

the
financial
condition
of
the
government
as
shown
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
june
was
very
satisfactory
the
ordinary

for

expenses
and
capital
outlays
excluding

panama
canal
disbursements
including
the

on
the

amounted
to
leaving
a
surplus
of
the

receipts
amounted
to
while
the
payments
made
for
the

from
the

amounted
to

left
a
surplus
of

over

of
the
first
time
in
years
in
which
a
surplus
occurred
the

of

the

bearing
no

including

national

redeemed
and
fractional

amounted
to

a
total
of

and
noninterest
bearing
debt
amounting
to
the
actual
disbursements
exclusive
of
those
for
the
panama
canal
and
for
the
postal
service
for
the
year
ending
june
were
the
actual
disbursements
for
the
year
ending
june
exclusive
of
the
panama
canal
and
the
postal
service
disbursements
were
making
a
decrease
of
in
yearly
expenditures
in
the
year
under
that
of
for
the
year
ending
june
the
estimated
receipts
exclusive
of
the

are
while
the
total
estimates
exclusive
of
those
for
the
panama
canal
and
the
postal
expenditures
payable
from
the
postal

amount
to
this
is
a
decrease
in
the
estimates
from
that
of
the
estimates
of
for
the
year
ending

the
estimated

exclusive
of

are
while
the
total
estimated
appropriations
exclusive

will
amount
to
this
is
a
decrease
in
the
estimates
from
that
of
the
estimates
of
as
to
the
postal

the
expansion
of
the
business
in
that
department
the
normal
increase
in
the
post
office
and
the
extension
of
the
service
will
increase
the
outlay
to
the
sum
of
but
as
the
department
was
selfsustaining
this
year
the
postmaster
general
is
assured
that
next
year
the
receipts
will
at
least
equal
the
expenditures
and
probably
exceed
them
by
more
than
the
surplus
of
this
year
it
is
fair
and
equitable
therefore
in
determining
the
economy
with
which
the
government
has
been
run
to
exclude
the
transactions
of
a
department
like
the
post
office
department
which
relies
for
its
support
upon
its
receipts
in
calculations
heretofore
made
for
comparison
of
economy
in
each
year
it
has
been
the
proper
custom
only
to
include
in
the
statement
the
deficit
in
the
post
office
department
which
was
paid
out
of
the
treasury
a
calculation
of
the
actual
increase
in
the
expenses
of
government
arising
from
the
increase
in
the
population
and
the
general
expansion
of
governmental
functions
except
those
of
the
post
office
for
a
number
of
years
shows
a
normal
increase
of
about
per
cent
a
year
by
directing
the
exercise
of
great
care
to
keep
down
the
expenses
and
the
estimates
we
have
succeeded
in
reducing
the
total
disbursements
each
year
the
credit
of
the
united
states
the
credit
of
this
government
was
shown
to
be
better
than
that
of
any
other
government
by
the
sale
of
the
panama
canal
per
cent
bonds
these
bonds
did
not
give
their
owners
the
privilege
of
using
them
as
a
basis
for
banknote
circulation
nor
was
there
any
other
privilege
extended
to
them
which
would
affect
their
general
market
value
their
sale
therefore
measured
the
credit
of
the
government
the
premium
which
was
realized
upon
the
bonds
made

and

i
in
the

department
the
efficiency
and
economy
work
has
been
kept
steadily
up
provision
is
made
for
the
elimination
of
positions
during
the
coming
year
two
hundred
and
sixtyseven
statutory
positions
were
eliminated
during
the
last
year
in
the
office
of
the
treasury
in
washington
and
positions
in
the
year
making
an
elimination
of
statutory
positions
since
march
and
this
has
been
done
without
the
discharge
of
anybody
because
the
normal
resignations
and
deaths
have
b
een
equal
to
the
elimination
of
the
places
a
system
of
transfers
having
taken
care
of
the
persons
whose
positions
were
dropped
out
in
the
field
service
if
the
department
too
positions
have
been
eliminated
down
to
the
present
time

a
total
net
reduction
of
all

number

the
efficiency
of
the
work
of
the
department
has
increased
monetary
reform
a
matter
of
first
importance
that
will
come
before
congress
for
action
at
this
session
is
monetary
reform
the
congress
has
itself
arranged
an
early
introduction
of
this
great
question
through
the
report
of
its
monetary
commission
this
commission
was
appointed
to
recommend
a
solution
of
the
banking
and
currency
problems
so
long
confronting
the
nation
and
to
furnish
the
facts
and
data
necessary
to
enable
the
congress
to
take
action
the
commission
was
appointed
when
an
impressive
and
urgent
popular
demand
for
legislative
relief
suddenly
arose
out
of
the
distressing
situation
of
the
people
caused
by
the
deplorable
panic
of
the
congress
decided
that
while
it
could
not
give
immediately
the
relief
required
it
would
provide
a
commission
to
furnish
the
means
for
prompt
action
at
a
later
date
in
order
to
do
its
work
with
thoroughness
and
precision
this
commission
has
taken
some
time
to
make
its
report
the
country
is
undoubtedly
hoping
for
as
prompt
action
on
the
report
as
the
convenience
of
the
congress
can
permit
the
recognition
of
the
gross
imperfections
and
marked
inadequacy
of
our
banking
and
currency
system
even
in
our
most
quiet
financial
periods
is
of
long
standing
and
later
there
has
matured
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
our
system
is
responsible
for
the
extraordinary
devastation
waste
and
business
paralysis
of
our
recurring
periods
of
panic
though
the
members
of
the
monetary
commission
have
for
a
considerable
time
been
working
in
the
open
and
while
large
numbers
of
the
people
have
been
openly
working
with
them
and
while
the
press
has
largely
noted
and
discussed
this
work
as
it
has
proceeded
so
that
the
report
of
the
commission
promises
to
represent
a
national
movement
the
details
of
the
report
are
still
being
considered
i
can
not
therefore
do
much
more
at
this
time
than
commend
the
immense
importance
of
monetary
reform
urge
prompt
consideration
and
action
when
the
commissions
report
is
received
and
express
my
satisfaction
that
the
plan
to
be
proposed
promises
to
embrace
main
features
that
having
met
the
approval
of
a
great
preponderance
of
the
practical
and
professional
opinion
of
the
country
are
likely
to
meet
equal
approval
in
congress
it
is
exceedingly
fortunate
that
the
wise
and
undisputed
policy
of
maintaining
unchanged
the
main
features
of
our
banking
system
rendered
it
at
once
impossible
to
introduce
a
central
bank
for
a
central
bank
would
certainly
have
been
resisted
and
a
plan
into
which
it
could
have
been
introduced
would
probably
have
been
defeated
but
as
a
central
bank
could
not
be
a
part
of
the
only
plan
discussed
or
considered
that
troublesome
question
is
eliminated
and
ingenious
and
novel
as
the
proposed
national
reserve
association
appears
it
simply
is
a
logical
outgrowth
of
what
is
best
in
our
present
system
and
is
in
fact
the
fulfillment
of
that
system
exactly
how
the
management
of
that
association
should
be
organized
is
a
question
still
open
it
seems
to
be
desirable
that
the
banks
which
would
own
the
association
should
in
the
main
manage
it
it
will
be
an
agency
of
the
banks
to
act
for
them
and
they
can
be
trusted
better
than
anybody
else
chiefly
to
conduct
it
it
is
mainly
bankers
work
but
there
must
be
some
form
of
government
supervision
and
ultimate
control
and
i
favor
a
reasonable
representation
of
the
government
in
the
management
i
entertain
no
fear
of
the
introduction
of
politics
or
of
any
undesirable
influences
from
a
properly
measured
government
representation
i
trust
that
all
banks
of
the
country
possessing
the
requisite
standards
will
be
placed
upon
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
of
opportunity
both
the
national
system
and
the
state
system
should
be
fairly
recognized
leaving
them
eventually
to
coalesce
if
that
shall
prove
to
be
their
tendency
but
such
evolution
can
not
develop
impartially
if
the
banks
of
one
system
are
given
or
permitted
any
advantages
of
opportunity
over
those
of
the
other
system
and
i
trust
also
that
the
new
legislation
will
carefully
and
completely
protect
and
assure
the
individuality
and
the
independence
of
each
bank
to
the
end
that
any
tendency
there
may
ever
be
toward
a
consolidation
of
the
money
or
banking
power
of
the
nation
shall
be
defeated
it
will
always
be
possible
of
course
to
correct
any
features
of
the
new
law
which
may
in
practice
prove
to
be
unwise
so
that
while
this
law
is
sure
to
be
enacted
under
conditions
of
unusual
knowledge
and
authority
it
also
will
include
it
is
well
to
remember
the
possibility
of
future
amendment
with
the
present
prospects
of
this
longawaited
reform
encouraging
us
it
would
be
singularly
unfortunate
if
this
monetary
question
should
by
any
chance
become
a
party
issue
and
i
sincerely
hope
it
will
not
the
exceeding
amount
of
consideration
it
has
received
from
the
people
of
the
nation
has
been
wholly
nonpartisan
and
the
congress
set
its
nonpartisan
seal
upon
it
when
the
monetary
commission
was
appointed
in
commending
the
question
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
i
speak
for
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
great
number
of
my
fellow
citizens
who
without
any
thought
of
party
or
partisanship
feel
with
remarkable
earnestness
that
this
reform
is
necessary
to
the
interests
of
all
the
people
the
war
department
there
is
now
before
congress
a
dill
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
increase
the
efficiency
and
decrease
the
expense
of
the
army
it
contains
four
principal
features
first
a
consolidation
of
the
general
staff
with
the
adjutant
generals
and
the
inspector
generals
departments
second
a
consolidation
of
the
quartermasters
department
with
the
subsistence
and
the
pay
departments
third
the
creation
of
an
army
service
corps
and
fourth
an
extension
of
the
enlistment
period
from
three
to
five
years
with
the
establishment
of
an
army
service
corps
as
proposed
in
the
bill
i
am
thoroughly
in
accord
and
am
convinced
that
the
establishment
of
such
a
corps
will
result
in
a
material
economy
and
a
very
great
increase
of
efficiency
in
the
army
it
has
repeatedly
been
recommended
by
me
and
my
predecessors
i
also
believe
that
a
consolidation
of
the
staff
corps
can
be
made
with
a
resulting
increase
in
efficiency
and
economy
but
not
along
the
lines
provided
in
the
bill
under
consideration
i
am
opposed
to
any
plan
the
result
of
which
would
be
to
break
up
or
interfere
with
the
essential
principles
of
the
detail
system
in
the
staff
corps
established
by
the
act
of
february
and
i
am
opposed
to
any
plan
the
result
of
which
would
be
to
give
to
the
officer
selected
as
chief
of
staff
or
to
any
other
member
of
the
general
staff
corps
greater
permanency
of
office
than
he
now
has
under
the
existing
law
neither
the
chief
of
staff
nor
any
other
member
of
the
general
staff
corps
can
remain
in
office
for
a
period
of
more
than
four
years
and
there
must
be
an
interval
of
two
years
between
successive
tours
of
duty
the
bill
referred
to
provides
that
certain
persons
shall
become
permanent
members
of
the
general
staff
corps
and
that
certain
others
are
subject
to
redetail
without
an
interval
of
two
years
such
provision
is
fraught
with
danger
to
the
welfare
of
the
army
and
would
practically
nullify
the
main
purpose
of
the
law
creating
the
missing
text
in
making
the
consolidations
no
reduction
should
be
made
in
the
total
number
of
officers
of
the
army
of
whom
there
are
now
too
few
to
perform
the
duties
imposed
by
law
i
have
in
the
past
recommended
an
increase
in
the
number
of
officers
by
in
order
to
provide
sufficient
officers
to
perform
all
classes
of
staff
duty
and
to
reduce
the
number
of
line
officers
detached
from
their
commands
congress
at
the
last
session
increased
the
total
number
of
officers
by
but
this
is
not
enough
promotion
in
the
line
of
the
army
is
too
slow
officers
do
not
attain
command
rank
at
an
age
early
enough
properly
to
exercise
it
it
would
be
a
mistake
further
to
retard
this
already
slow
promotion
by
throwing
back
into
the
line
of
the
arm
a
number
of
highranking
officers
to
be
absorbed
as
is
provided
in
the
missing
text
another
feature
of
the
bill
which
i
believe
to
be
a
mistake
is
the
proposed
increase
in
the
term
of
enlistment
from
three
to
five
ears
i
believe
it
would
be
better
to
enlist
men
for
six
years
release
them
at
the
end
of
three
years
from
active
service
and
put
them
in
reserve
for
the
remaining
three
years
reenlistments
should
be
largely
confined
to
the
noncommissioned
officers
and
other
enlisted
men
in
the
skilled
grades
this
plan
by
the
payment
of
a
comparatively
small
compensation
during
the
three
years
of
reserve
would
keep
a
large
body
of
men
at
the
call
of
the
government
trained
and
ready
for
missing
text
the
army
of
the
united
states
is
in
good
condition
it
showed
itself
able
to
meet
an
emergency
in
the
successful
mobilization
of
an
army
division
of
from
to
men
which
took
place
along
the
border
of
mexico
during
the
recent
disturbances
in
that
country
the
marvelous
freedom
from
the
ordinary
camp
diseases
of
typhoid
fever
and
measles
is
referred
to
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
shows
such
an
effectiveness
in
the
sanitary
regulations
and
treatment
of
the
medical
corps
and
in
the
discipline
of
the
army
itself
as
to
invoke
the
highest
commendation
memorial
amphitheater
at
arlington
i
beg
to
renew
my
recommendation
of
last
year
that
the
congress
appropriate
for
a
memorial
amphitheater
at
arlington
va
the
funds
required
to
construct
it
upon
the
plans
already
approved
the
panama
canal
the
very
satisfactory
progress
made
on
the
panama
canal
last
year
has
continued
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
canal
will
be
completed
as
early
as
the
st
of
july
unless
something
unforeseen
occurs
this
is
about
months
before
the
time
promised
by
the
engineers
we
ar
e
now
near
enough
the
completion
of
the
canal
to
make
it
imperatively
necessary
that
legislation
should
be
enacted
to
fix
the
method
by
which
the
canal
shall
be
maintained
and
controlled
and
the
zone
governed
the
fact
is
that
today
there
is
no
statutory
law
by
authority
of
which
the
president
is
maintaining
the
government
of
the
zone
such
authority
was
given
in
an
amendment
to
the
spooner
act
which
expired
by
the
terms
of
its
own
limitation
some
years
ago
since
that
time
the
government
has
continued
under
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
that
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress
there
is
necessarily
an
implied
authority
on
the
part
of
the
executive
to
maintain
a
government
in
a
territory
in
which
he
has
to
see
that
the
laws
are
executed
the
fact
that
we
have
been
able
thus
to
get
along
during
the
important
days
of
construction
without
legislation
expressly
formulating
the
government
of
the
zone
or
delegating
the
creation
of
it
to
the
president
is
not
a
reason
for
supposing
that
we
may
continue
the
same
kind
of
a
government
after
the
construction
is
finished
the
implied
authority
of
the
president
to
maintain
a
civil
government
in
the
zone
may
be
derived
from
the
mandatory
direction
given
him
in
the
original
spooner
act
by
which
he
was
commanded
to
build
the
canal
but
certainly
now
that
the
canal
is
about
to
be
completed
and
to
be
put
under
a
permanent
management
there
ought
to
be
specific
statutory
authority
for
its
regulation
and
control
and
for
the
government
of
the
zone
which
we
hold
for
the
chief
and
main
purpose
of
operating
the
canal
i
fully
concur
with
the
secretary
of
war
that
the
problem
is
simply
the
management
of
a
great
public
work
and
not
the
government
of
a
local
republic
that
every
provision
must
be
directed
toward
the
successful
maintenance
of
the
canal
as
an
avenue
of
commerce
and
that
all
provisions
for
the
government
of
those
who
live
within
the
zone
should
be
subordinate
to
the
main
purpose
the
zone
is
miles
long
and
miles
wide
now
it
has
a
population
of
or
but
as
soon
as
the
work
of
construction
is
completed
the
towns
which
make
up
this
population
will
be
deserted
and
only
comparatively
few
natives
will
continue
their
residence
there
the
control
of
them
ought
to
approximate
a
military
government
one
judge
and
two
justices
of
the
peace
will
be
sufficient
to
attend
to
all
the
judicial
and
litigated
business
there
is
with
a
few
fundamental
laws
of
congress
the
zone
should
be
governed
by
the
orders
of
the
president
issued
through
the
war
department
as
it
is
today
provisions
can
be
made
for
the
guaranties
of
life
liberty
and
property
but
beyond
those
the
government
should
be
that
of
a
military
reservation
managed
in
connection
with
this
great
highway
of
trade
furnishing
supplies
and
repairs
in
my
last
annual
message
i
discussed
at
length
the
reasons
for
the
governments
assuming
the
task
of
furnishing
to
all
ships
that
use
the
canal
whether
our
own
naval
vessels
or
others
the
supplies
of
coal
and
oil
and
other
necessities
with
which
they
must
be
replenished
either
before
or
after
passing
through
the
canal
together
with
the
dock
facilities
and
repairs
of
every
character
this
it
is
thought
wise
to
do
through
the
government
because
the
government
must
establish
for
itself
for
its
own
naval
vessels
large
depots
and
dry
docks
and
warehouses
and
these
may
easily
be
enlarged
so
as
to
secure
to
the
world
public
using
the
canal
reasonable
prices
and
a
certainty
that
there
will
be
no
discrimination
between
those
who
wish
to
avail
themselves
of
such
facilities
tolls
i
renew
my
recommendation
with
respect
to
the
tolls
of
the
canal
that
within
limits
which
shall
seem
wise
to
congress
the
power
of
fixing
tolls
be
given
to
the
president
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
proper
conclusion
there
must
be
some
experimenting
and
this
can
not
be
done
if
congress
does
not
delegate
the
power
to
one
who
can
act
expeditiously
power
exists
to
relieve
american
shipping
i
am
very
confident
that
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
relieve
from
the
payment
of
tolls
any
part
of
our
shipping
that
congress
deems
wise
we
own
the
canal
it
was
our
money
that
built
it
we
have
the
right
to
charge
tolls
for
its
use
those
tolls
must
be
the
same
to
everyone
but
when
we
are
dealing
with
our
own
ships
the
practice
of
many
governments
of
subsidizing
their
own
merchant
vessels
is
so
well
established
in
general
that
a
subsidy
equal
to
the
tolls
an
equivalent
remission
of
tolls
can
not
be
held
to
be
a
discrimination
in
the
use
of
the
canal
the
practice
in
the
suez
canal
makes
this
clear
the
experiment
in
tolls
to
be
made
by
the
president
would
doubtless
disclose
how
great
a
burden
of
tolls
the
coastwise
trade
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
coast
could
bear
without
preventing
its
usefulness
in
competition
with
the
transcontinental
railroads
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
building
the
canal
was
to
set
up
this
competition
and
to
bring
the
two
shores
closer
together
as
a
practical
trade
problem
it
may
be
that
the
tolls
will
have
to
be
wholly
remitted
i
do
not
think
this
is
the
best
principle
because
i
believe
that
the
cost
of
such
a
government
work
as
the
panama
canal
ought
to
be
imposed
gradually
but
certainly
upon
the
trade
which
it
creates
and
makes
possible
so
far
as
we
can
consistent
with
the
development
of
the
worlds
trade
through
the
canal
and
the
benefit
which
it
was
intended
to
secure
to
the
east
and
west
coastwise
trade
we
ought
to
labor
to
secure
from
the
canal
tolls
a
sufficient
amount
ultimately
to
meet
the
debt
which
we
have
assumed
and
to
pay
the
interest
the
philippine
islands
in
respect
to
the
philippines
i
urgently
join
in
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
the
act
of
february
limiting
the
indebtedness
that
may
be
incurred
by
the
philippine
government
for
the
construction
of
public
works
be
increased
from
to
the
finances
of
that
government
are
in
excellent
condition
the
maximum
sum
mentioned
is
quite
low
as
compared
with
the
amount
of
indebtedness
of
other
governments
with
similar
resources
and
the
success
which
has
attended
the
expenditure
of
the
in
the
useful
improvements
of
the
harbors
and
other
places
in
the
islands
justifies
and
requires
additional
expenditures
for
like
purposes
naturalization
i
also
join
in
the
recommendation
that
the
legislature
of
the
philippine
islands
be
authorized
to
provide
for
the
naturalization
of
filipinos
and
others
who
by
the
present
law
are
treated
as
aliens
so
as
to
enable
them
to
become
citizens
of
the
philippine
islands
friars
lands
pending
an
investigation
by
congress
at
its
last
session
through
one
of
its
committees
into
the
disposition
of
the
friars
lands
secretary
dickinson
directed
that
the
friars
lands
should
not
be
sold
in
excess
of
the
limits
fixed
for
the
public
lands
until
congress
should
pass
upon
the
subject
or
should
have
concluded
its
investigation
this
order
has
been
an
obstruction
to
the
disposition
of
the
lands
and
i
expect
to
direct
the
secretary
of
war
to
return
to
the
practice
under
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
which
will
enable
us
to
dispose
of
the
lands
much
more
promptly
and
to
prepare
a
sinking
fund
with
which
to
meet
the
of
bonds
issued
for
the
purchase
of
the
lands
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
attorney
generals
construction
was
a
proper
one
and
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
everyone
that
the
land
shall
be
promptly
disposed
of
the
danger
of
creating
a
monopoly
of
ownership
in
lands
under
the
statutes
as
construed
is
nothing
there
are
only
two
tracts
of
acres
each
unimproved
and
in
remote
provinces
that
are
likely
to
be
disposed
of
in
bulk
and
the
rest
of
the
lands
are
subject
to
the
limitation
that
they
shall
be
first
offered
to
the
present
tenants
and
lessors
who
hold
them
in
small
tracts
rivers
and
harbors
the
estimates
for
the
river
and
harbor
improvements
reach
for
the
coming
year
i
wish
to
urge
that
whenever
a
project
has
been
adopted
by
congress
as
one
to
be
completed
the
more
money
which
can
be
economically
expended
in
its
construction
in
each
year
the
greater
the
ultimate
economy
this
has
especial
application
to
the
improvement
of
the
mississippi
river
and
its
large
branches
it
seems
to
me
that
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
money
now
being
annually
expended
in
the
improvement
of
the
ohio
river
which
has
been
formally
adopted
by
congress
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
public
a
similar
change
ought
to
be
made
during
the
present
congress
in
the
amount
to
be
appropriated
for
the
missouri
river
the
engineers
say
that
the
cost
of
the
improvement
of
the
missouri
river
from
kansas
city
to
st
louis
in
order
to
secure
feet
as
a
permanent
channel
will
reach
there
have
been
at
least
three
recommendations
from
the
chief
of
engineers
that
if
the
improvement
be
adopted
should
be
expended
upon
it
annually
this
particular
improvement
is
especially
entitled
to
the
attention
of
congress
because
a
company
has
been
organized
in
kansas
city
with
a
capital
of
which
has
built
steamers
and
barges
and
is
actually
using
the
river
for
transportation
in
order
to
show
what
can
be
done
in
the
way
of
affecting
rates
between
kansas
city
and
st
louis
and
in
order
to
manifest
their
good
faith
and
confidence
in
respect
of
the
improvement
i
urgently
recommend
that
the
appropriation
for
this
improvement
be
increased
from
as
recommended
now
in
the
completion
of
a
contract
to
annually
so
that
the
work
may
be
done
in
years
waterway
from
the
lakes
to
the
gulf
the
project
for
a
navigable
waterway
from
lake
michigan
to
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
river
and
thence
via
the
mississippi
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
one
of
national
importance
in
view
of
the
work
already
accomplished
by
the
sanitary
district
of
chicago
an
agency
of
the
state
of
illinois
which
has
constructed
the
most
difficult
and
costly
stretch
of
this
waterway
and
made
it
an
asset
of
the
nation
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
people
of
illinois
have
authorized
the
expenditure
of
to
carry
this
waterway
miles
farther
to
utica
i
feel
that
it
is
fitting
that
this
work
should
be
supplemented
by
the
government
and
that
the
expen
ditures
recommended
by
the
special
board
of
engineers
on
the
waterway
from
utica
to
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
river
be
made
upon
lines
which
while
providing
a
waterway
for
the
nation
should
otherwise
benefit
that
state
to
the
fullest
extent
i
recommend
that
the
term
of
service
of
said
special
board
of
engineers
be
continued
and
that
it
be
empowered
to
reopen
the
question
of
the
treatment
of
the
lower
illinois
river
and
to
negotiate
with
a
properly
constituted
commission
representing
the
state
of
illinois
and
to
agree
upon
a
plan
for
the
improvement
of
the
lower
illinois
river
and
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
united
states
may
properly
cooperate
with
the
state
of
illinois
in
securing
the
construction
of
a
navigable
waterway
from
lockport
to
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
river
in
conjunction
with
the
development
of

by
that
state
between
lockport
and
utica
the
department
of
justice
removal
of
clerks
of
federal
courts
the
report
of
the
attorney
general
shows
that
he
has
subjected
to
close
examination
the
accounts
of
the
clerks
of
the
federal
courts
that
he
has
found
a
good
many
which
disclose
irregularities
or
dishonesty
but
that
he
has
had
considerable
difficulty
in
securing
an
effective
prosecution
or
removal
of
the
clerks
thus
derelict
i
am
certainly
not
unduly
prejudiced
against
the
federal
courts
but
the
fact
is
that
the
long
and
confidential
relations
which
grow
out
of
the
tenure
for
life
on
the
part
of
the
judge
and
the
practical
tenure
for
life
on
the
part
of
the
clerk
are
not
calculated
to
secure
the
strictness
of
dealing
by
the
judge
with
the
clerk
in
respect
to
his
fees
and
accounts
which
assures
in
the
clerks
conduct
a
freedom
from
overcharges
and
carelessness
the
relationship
between
the
judge
and
the
clerk
makes
it
ungracious
for
members
of
the
bar
to
complain
of
the
clerk
or
for
department
examiners
to
make
charges
against
him
to
be
heard
by
the
court
and
an
order
of
removal
of
a
clerk
and
a
judgment
for
the
recovery
of
fees
are
in
some
cases
reluctantly
entered
by
the
judge
for
this
reason
i
recommend
an
amendment
to
the
law
whereby
the
president
shall
be
given
power
to
remove
the
clerks
for
cause
this
provision
need
not
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
judge
to
appoint
his
clerk
or
to
remove
him
french
spoliation
awards
in
my
last
message
i
recommended
to
congress
that
it
authorize
the
payment
of
the
findings
or
judgments
of
the
court
of
claims
in
the
matter
of
the
french
spoliation
cases
there
has
been
no
appropriation
to
pay
these
judgments
since
the
findings
and
awards
were
obtained
after
a
very
bitter
fight
the
government
succeeding
in
about
per
cent
of
the
cases
the
amount
of
the
awards
ought
as
a
matter
of
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
be
paid
employers
liability
and
workmens
compensation
commission
the
limitation
of
the
liability
of
the
master
to
his
servant
for
personal
injuries
to
such
as
are
occasioned
by
his
fault
has
been
abandoned
in
most
civilized
countries
and
provision
made
whereby
the
employee
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
is
compensated
for
his
loss
of
working
ability
irrespective
of
negligence
the
principle
upon
which
such
provision
proceeds
is
that
accidental
injuries
to
workmen
in
modern
industry
with
its
vast
complexity
and
inherent
dangers
arising
from
complicated
machinery
and
the
use
of
the
great
forces
of
steam
and
electricity
should
be
regarded
as
risks
of
the
industry
and
the
loss
borne
in
some
equitable
proportion
by
those
who
for
their
own
profit
engage
therein
in
recognition
of
this
the
last
congress
authorized
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
investigate
the
subject
of
employers
liability
and
workmens
compensation
and
to
report
the
result
of
their
investigations
through
the
president
to
congress
this
commission
was
appointed
and
has
been
at
work
holding
hearings
gathering
data
and
considering
the
subject
and
it
is
expected
will
be
able
to
report
by
the
first
of
the
year
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
law
it
is
hoped
and
expected
that
the
commission
will
suggest
legislation
which
will
enable
us
to
put
in
the
place
of
the
present
wasteful
and
sometimes
unjust
system
of
employers
liability
a
plan
of
compensation
which
will
afford
some
certain
and
definite
relief
to
all
employees
who
are
injured
in
the
course
of
their
employment
in
those
industries
which
are
subject
to
the
regulating
power
of
congress

prevent

unnecessary
cost

in

of
the

for
the
prevention

in
litigation
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
has
taken
steps
to
reform
the
present
equity
rules
of
the
federal
courts
and
that
we
may
in
the
near
future
expect
a
revision
of
them
which
will
be
a
long
step
in
the
right
direction
the
american
bar
association
has
recommended
to
congress
several
bills
expediting
procedure
one
of
which
has
already
passed
the
house
unanimously
february
this
directs
that
no
judgment
should
be
set
aside
or
reversed
or
new
trial
granted
unless
it
appears
to
the
court
after
an
examination
of
the
entire
cause
that
the
error
complained
of
has
injuriously
affected
the
substantial
rights
of
the
parties
and
also
provides
for
the
submission
of
issues
of
fact
to
a
jury
reserving
questions
of
law
for
subsequent
argument
and
decision
i
hope
this
bill
will
pass
the
senate
and
become
law
for
it
will
simplify
the
procedure
at
law
another
bill
to
amend
chapter
ii
of
the
judicial
code
in
order
to
avoid
errors
in
pleading
was
presented
by
the
same
association
and
one
enlarging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
so
as
to
permit
that
court
to
examine
upon
a
writ
of
error
all
cases
in
which
any
right
or
title
is
claimed
under
the
constitution
or
any
statute
or
treaty
of
the
united
states
whether
the
decision
in
the
court
below
has
been
against
the
right
or
title
or
in
its
favor
both
these
measures
are
in
the
interest
of
justice
and
should
be
passed
post
office
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
administration

to
the
extent
of
it

very
much

in

of

needed
for

maintenance
of

for

year
an
item
of
has
been
inserted
to
cover
the
preliminary
expense
of
establishing
a

post
on

routes
as
well
as
to

an
investigation
having
for
its
object
the
final
establishment
of
a
general
parcel
post
on
all
railway
and
steamboat
transportation
routes
the
department
believes
that
after
the
initial
expenses
of
establishing
the
system
are
defrayed
and
the
parcel
post
is
in
full
operation
on
the
rural
routes
it
will
not
only
bring
in
sufficient
revenue
to
meet
its
cost
but
also
a
surplus
that
can
be
utilized
in
paying
the
expenses
of
a
parcel
post
in
the
city
delivery
service
it
is
hoped
that
congress
will
authorize
the
immediate
establishment
of
a
limited
parcel
post
on
such
rural
routes
as
may
be
selected
providing
for
the
delivery
along
the
routes
of
parcels
not
exceeding
eleven
pounds
which
is
the
weight
limit
for
the
international
parcel
post
or
at
the
post
office
from
which
such
route
emanates
or
on
another
route
emanating
from
the
same
office
such
preliminary
service
will
prepare
the
way
for
the
more
thorough
and
comprehensive
inquiry
contemplated
in
asking
for
the
appropriation
mentioned
enable
the
department
to
gain
definite
information
concerning
the
practical
operation
of
a
general
system
and

at
the
same
time
extend
the
benefit
of
the
service
to
a
class
of
people
who
above
all
others
are
specially
in
need
of
it
the
suggestion
that
we
have
a
general
parcel
post
has
awakened
great
opposition
on
the
part
of
some
who
think
that
it
will
have
the
effect
to
destroy
the
business
of
the
country
storekeeper
instead
of
doing
this
i
think
the
change
will
greatly
increase
business
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
reduction
in
the
cost
of
living
it
will
bring
about
ought
to
make
its
coming
certain
the
navy
department
on
the
d
of
november
last
i
reviewed
the
fighting
fleet
of
battleships
and
other
vessels
assembled
in
new
york
harbor
consisting
of
battleships
armored
cruisers
cruisers
destroyers
torpedo
boats
submarines
and
other
attendant
vessels
making
vessels
of
all
classes
of
a
tonnage
of
tons
those
who
saw
the
fleet
were
struck
with
its
preparedness
and
with
its
high
military
efficiency
all
americans
should
be
proud
of
its
personnel
the
fleet
was
deficient
in
the
number
of
torpedo
destroyers
in
cruisers
and
in
colliers
as
well
as
in
large
battleship
cruisers
which
are
now
becoming
a
very
important
feature
of
foreign
navies
notably
the
british
german
and
japanese
the
building
plan
for
this
year
contemplates
two
battleships
and
two
colliers
this
is
because
the
other
and
smaller
vessels
can
be
built
much
more
rapidly
in
case
of
emergency
than
the
battleships
and
we
certainly
ought
to
continue
the
policy
of
two
battleships
a
year
until
after
the
panama
canal
is
finished
and
until
in
our
first
line
and
in
our
reserve
line
we
can
number
available
vessels
of
proper
armament
and
size
the
reorganization
of
the
navy
and
the
appointment
of
four
aids
to
the
secretary
have
continued
to
demonstrate
their
usefulness
it
would
be
difficult
now
to
administer
the
affairs
of
the
navy
without
the
expert
counsel
and
advice
of
these
aids
and
i
renew
the
recommendation
which
i
made
last
year
that
the
aids
be
recognized
by
statute
it
is
certain
that
the
navy
with
its
present
size
should
have
admirals
in
active
command
higher
than
rear
admirals
the
recognized
grades
in
order
are
admiral
of
the
fleet
admiral
vice
admiral
and
rear
admiral
our
great
battleship
fleet
is
commanded
by
a
rear
admiral
with
four
other
rear
admirals
under
his
orders
this
is
not
as
it
should
be
and
when
questions
of
precedence
arise
between
our
naval
officers
and
those
of
european
navies
the
american
rear
admiral
though
in
command
of
ten
times
the
force
of
a
foreign
vice
admiral
must
yield
precedence
to
the
latter
such
an
absurdity
ought
not
to
prevail
and
it
can
be
avoided
by
the
creation
of
two
or
three
positions
of
flag
rank
above
that
of
rear
admiral
i
attended
the
opening
of
the
new
training
school
at
north
chicago
ill
and
am
glad
to
note
the
opportunity
which
this
gives
for
drawing
upon
young
men
of
the
country
from
the
interior
from
farms
stores
shops
and
offices
which
insures
a
high
average
of
intelligence
and
character
among
them
and
which
they
showed
in
the
very
wonderful
improvement
in
discipline
and
drill
which
only
a
few
short
weeks
presence
at
the
naval
station
had
made
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
consideration
of
the
new
system
of
detention
and
of
punishment
for
army
and
navy
enlisted
men
which
has
obtained
in
great
britain
and
which
has
made
greatly
for
the
better
control
of
the
men
we
should
adopt
a
similar
system
here
like
the
treasury
department
and
the
war
department
the
navy
department
has
given
much
attention
to
economy
in
administration
and
has
cut
down
a
number
of
unnecessary
expenses
and
reduced
its
estimates
except
for
construction
and
the
increase
that
that
involves
i
urge
upon
congress
the
necessity
for
an
immediate
increase
of
men
in
the
enlisted
strength
of
the
navy
provided
for
in
the
estimates
four
thousand
more
are
now
needed
to
man
all
the
available
vessels
there
are
in
the
service
today
about
enlisted
men
of
all
ratings
careful
computation
shows
that
in
april
men
will
be
required
for
vessels
in
commission
and
apprentice
seamen
should
be
kept
under
training
at
all
times
abolition
of
navy
yards
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
recommended
the
abolition
of
certain
of
the
smaller
and
unnecessary
navy
yards
and
in
order
to
furnish
a
complete
and
comprehensive
report
has
referred
the
question
of
all
navy
yards
to
the
joint
board
of
the
army
and
navy
this
board
will
shortly
make
its
report
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
advises
me
that
his
recommendations
on
the
subject
will
be
presented
early
in
the
coming
year
the
measure
of
economy
contained
in
a
proper
handling
of
this
subject
is
so
great
and
so
important
to
the
interests
of
the
nation
that
i
shall
present
it
to
congress
as
a
separate
subject
apart
from
my
annual
message
concentration
of
the
necessary
work
for
naval
vessels
in
a
few
navy
yards
on
each
coast
is
a
vital
necessity
if
proper
economy
in
government
expenditures
is
to
be
attained
amalgamation
of
staff
corps
in
the
navy
the
secretary
of
the
navy
is
striving
to
unify
the
various
corps
of
the
navy
to
the
extent
possible
and
thereby
stimulate
a
navy
spirit
as
distinguished
from
a
corps
spirit
in
this
he
has
my
warm
support
all
officers
are
to
be
naval
officers
first
and
specialists
afterwards
this
means
that
officers
will
take
up
at
least
one
specialty
such
as
ordnance
construction
or
engineering
this
is
practically
what
is
done
now
only
some
of
the
specialists
like
the
pay
officers
and
naval
constructors
are
not
of
the
line
it
is
proposed
to
make
them
all
of
the
line
all
combatant
corps
should
obviously
be
of
the
line
this
necessitates
amalgamating
the
pay
officers
and
also
those
engaged
in
the
technical
work
of
producing
the
finished
ship
this
is
at
present
the
case
with
the
single
exception
of
the
naval
constructors
whom
it
is
now
proposed
to
amalgamate
with
the
line
council
of
national
defense
i
urge
again
upon
congress
the
desirability
of
establishing
the
council
of
national
defense
the
bill
to
establish
this
council
was
before
congress
last
winter
and
it
is
hoped
that
this
legislation
will
pass
during
the
present
session
the
purpose
of
the
council
is
to
determine
the
general
policy
of
national
defense
and
to
recommend
to
congress
and
to
the
president
such
measures
relating
to
it
as
it
shall
deem
necessary
and
expedient
no
such
machinery
is
now
provided
by
which
the
readiness
of
the
army
and
navy
may
be
improved
and
the
programs
of
military
and
naval
requirements
shall
be
coordinated
and
properly
scrutinized
with
a
view
of
the
necessities
of
the
whole
nation
rather
than
of
separate
departments
departments
of
agriculture
and
commerce
and
labor
for
the
consideration
of
matters
which
are
pending
or
have
been
disposed
of
in
the
agricultural
department
and
in
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
i
refer
to
the
very
excellent
reports
of
the
secretaries
of
those
departments
i
shall
not
be
able
to
submit
to
congress
until
after
the
christmas
holidays
the
question
of
conservation
of
our
resources
arising
in
alaska
and
the
west
and
the
question
of
the
rate
for
secondclass
mail
matter
in
the
post
office
department
commission
on
efficiency
and
economy
the
law
does
not
require
the
submission
of
the
reports
of
the
commission
on
economy
and
efficiency
until
the
st
of
december
i
shall
therefore
not
be
able
to
submit
a
report
of
the
work
of
that
commission
until
the
assembling
of
congress
after
the
holidays
civil
retirement
and
contributory
pension
system
i
have
already
advocated
in
my
last
annual
message
the
adoption
of
a
civilservice
retirement
system
with
a
contributory
feature
to
it
so
as
to
reduce
to
a
minimum
the
cost
to
the
government
of
the
pensions
to
be
paid
after
considerable
reflection
i
am
very
much
opposed
to
a
pension
system
that
involves
no
contribution
from
the
employees
i
think
the
experience
of
other
governments
justifies
this
view
but
the
crying
necessity
for
some
such
contributory
system
with
possibly
a
preliminary
governmental
outlay
in
order
to
cover
the
initial
cost
and
to
set
the
system
going
at
once
while
the
contributions
are
accumulating
is
manifest
on
every
side
nothing
will
so
much
promote
the
economy
and
efficiency
of
the
government
as
such
a
system
elimination
of
all
local
offices
from
politics
i
wish
to
renew
again
my
recommendation
that
all
the
local
offices
throughout
the
country
including
collectors
of
internal
revenue
collectors
of
customs
postmasters
of
all
four
classes
immigration
commissioners
and
marshals
should
be
by
law
covered
into
the
classified
service
the
necessity
for
confirmation
by
the
senate
be
removed
and
the
president
and
the
others
whose
time
is
now
taken
up
in
distributing
this
patronage
under
the
custom
that
has
prevailed
since
the
beginning
of
the
government
in
accordance
with
the
recommendation
of
the
senators
and
congressmen
of
the
majority
party
should
be
relieved
from
this
burden
i
am
confident
that
such
a
change
would
greatly
reduce
the
cost
of
administering
the
government
and
that
it
would
add
greatly
to
its
efficiency
it
would
take
away
the
power
to
use
the
patronage
of
the
government
for
political
purposes
when
officers
are
recommended
by
senators
and
congressmen
from
political
motives
and
for
political
services
rendered
it
is
impossible
to
expect
that
while
in
office
the
appointees
will
not
regard
their
tenure
as
more
or
less
dependent
upon
continued
political
service
for
their
patrons
and
no
regulations
however
stiff
or
rigid
will
prevent
this
because
such
regulations
in
view
of
the
method
and
motive
for
selection
are
plainly
inconsistent
and
deemed
hardly
worthy
of
respect

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
during
the
past
year
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
have
continued
upon
a
basis
of
friendship
and
good
understanding
arbitration
the
year
has
been
notable
as
witnessing
the
pacific
settlement
of
two
important
international
controversies
before
the
permanent
court
of
the
hague
the
arbitration
of
the
fisheries
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
which
has
been
the
source
of
nearly
continuous
diplomatic
correspondence
since
the
fisheries
convention
of
has
given
an
award
which
is
satisfactory
to
both
parties
this
arbitration
is
particularly
noteworthy
not
only
because
of
the
eminently
just
results
secured
but
also
because
it
is
the
first
arbitration
held
under
the
general
arbitration
treaty
of
april
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
and
disposes
of
a
controversy
the
settlement
of
which
has
resisted
every
other
resource
of
diplomacy
and
which
for
nearly
ninety
years
has
been
the
cause
of
friction
between
two
countries
whose
common
interest
lies
in
maintaining
the
most
friendly
and
cordial
relations
with
each
other
the
united
states
was
ably
represented
before
the
tribunal
the
complicated
history
of
the
questions
arising
made
the
issue
depend
more
than
ordinarily
in
such
cases
upon
the
care
and
skill
with
which
our
case
was
presented
and
i
should
be
wanting
in
proper
recognition
of
a
great
patriotic
service
if
i
did
not
refer
to
the
lucid
historical
analysis
of
the
facts
and
the
signal
ability
and
force
of
the
argumentsix
days
in
lengthpresented
to
the
court
in
support
of
our
case
by
mr
elihu
root
as
secretary
of
state
mr
root
had
given
close
study
to
the
intricate
facts
bearing
on
the
controversy
and
by
diplomatic
correspondence
had
helped
to
frame
the
issues
at
the
solicitation
of
the
secretary
of
state
and
myself
mr
root
though
burdened
by
his
duties
as
senator
from
new
york
undertook
the
preparation
of
the
case
as
leading
counsel
with
the
condition
imposed
by
himself
that
in
view
of
his
position
as
senator
he
should
not
receive
any
compensation
the
tribunal
constituted
at
the
hague
by
the
governments
of
the
united
states
and
venezuela
has
completed
its
deliberations
and
has
rendered
an
award
in
the
case
of
the
orinoco
steamship
company
against
venezuela
the
award
may
be
regarded
as
satisfactory
since
it
has
pursuant
to
the
contentions
of
the
united
states
recognized
a
number
of
important
principles
making
for
a
judicial
attitude
in
the
determining
of
international
disputes
in
view
of
grave
doubts
which
had
been
raised
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
hague
convention
for
the
establishment
of
an
international
prize
court
now
before
the
senate
for
ratification
because
of
that
provision
of
the
convention
which
provides
that
there
may
be
an
appeal
to
the
proposed
court
from
the
decisions
of
national
courts
this
government
proposed
in
an
identic
circular
note
addressed
to
those
powers
who
had
taken
part
in
the
london
maritime
conference
that
the
powers
signatory
to
the
convention
if
confronted
with
such
difficulty
might
insert
a
reservation
to
the
effect
that
appeals
to
the
international
prize
court
in
respect
to
decisions
of
its
national
tribunals
should
take
the
form
of
a
direct
claim
for
compensation
that
the
proceedings
thereupon
to
be
taken
should
be
in
the
form
of
a
trial
de
novo
and
that
judgment
of
the
court
should
consist
of
compensation
for
the
illegal
capture
irrespective
of
the
decision
of
the
national
court
whose
judgment
had
thus
been
internationally
involved
as
the
result
of
an
informal
discussion
it
was
decided
to
provide
such
procedure
by
means
of
a
separate
protocol
which
should
be
ratified
at
the
same
time
as
the
prize
court
convention
itself
accordingly
the
government
of
the
netherlands
at
the
request
of
this
government
proposed
under
date
of
may
to
the
powers
signatory
to
the
hague
convention
the
negotiation
of
a
supplemental
protocol
embodying
stipulations
providing
for
this
alternative
procedure
it
is
gratifying
to
observe
that
this
additional
protocol
is
being
signed
without
objection
by
the
powers
signatory
to
the
original
convention
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
international
prize
court
will
be
soon
established
the
identic
circular
note
also
proposed
that
the
international
prize
court
when
established
should
be
endowed
with
the
functions
of
an
arbitral
court
of
justice
under
and
pursuant
to
the
recommendation
adopted
by
the
last
hague
conference
the
replies
received
from
the
various
powers
to
this
proposal
inspire
the
hope
that
this
also
may
be
accomplished
within
the
reasonably
near
future
it
is
believed
that
the
establishment
of
these
two
tribunals
will
go
a
long
way
toward
securing
the
arbitration
of
many
questions
which
have
heretofore
threatened
and
at
times
destroyed
the
peace

it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
the
negotiations
for
a
loan
to
the
chinese
government
for
the
co
nstruction
of
the
trunk
railway
lines
from
hankow
southward

were

the
results
approved
by
their
respective

already
initialed
by
the
chinese
government
is
now
awaiting
formal
ratification
the
basis
of
the
settlement
of
the
terms
of

was
one
of
exact
equality
between
america

france
and
germany
in
respect
to
financing
the
loan
and
supplying
materials
for
the
proposed

their
future
branches
the
application
of
the
principle
underlying
the
policy
of
the
united
states
in
regard
to
the
hukuang
loan
viz
that
of
the
internationalization
of
the
foreign
interest
in
such
of
the
railways
of
china
as
may
be
financed
by
foreign
countries
was
suggested
on
a
broader
scale
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
a
proposal
for
internationalization
and
commercial
neutralization
of
all
the
railways
of
manchuria
while
the
principle
which
led
to
the
proposal
of
this
government
was
generally
admitted
by
the
powers
to
whom
it
was
addressed
the
governments
of
russia
and
japan
apprehended
practical
difficulties
in
the
execution
of
the
larger
plan
which
prevented
their
ready
adherence
the
question
of
constructing
the
chinchowaigun
railway
by
means
of
an
international
loan
to
china
is
however
still
the
subject
of
friendly
discussion
by
the
interested
parties
the
policy
of
this
government
in
these
matters
has
been
directed
by
a
desire
to
make
the
use
of
american
capital
in
the
development
of
china
an
instrument
in
the
promotion
of
chinas
welfare
and
material
prosperity
without
prejudice
to
her
legitimate
rights
as
an
independent
political
power
this
policy
has
recently
found
further
exemplification
in
the
assistance
given
by
this
government
to
the
negotiations
between
china
and
a
group
of
american
bankers
for
a
loan
of
to
be
employed
chiefly
in
currency
reform
the
confusion
which
has
from
ancient
times
existed
in
the
monetary
usages
of
the
chinese
has
been
one
of
the
principal
obstacles
to
commercial
intercourse
with
that
people
the
united
states
in
its
treaty
of
with
china
obtained
a
pledge
from
the
latter
to
introduce
a
uniform
national
coinage
and
the
following
year
at
the
request
of
china
this
government
sent
to
peking
a
member
of
the
international
exchange
commission
to
discuss
with
the
chinese
government
the
best
methods
of
introducing
the
reform
in
china
sent
a
commissioner
to
the
united
states
to
consult
with
american
financiers
as
to
the
possibility
of
securing
a
large
loan
with
which
to
inaugurate
the
new
currency
system
but
the
death
of
their
majesties
the
empress
dowager
and
the
emperor
of
china
interrupted
the
negotiations
which
were
not
resumed
until
a
few
months
ago
when
this
government
was
asked
to
communicate
to
the
bankers
concerned
the
request
of
china
for
a
loan
of
for
the
purpose
under
review
a
preliminary
agreement
between
the
american
group
and
china
has
been
made
covering
the
loan
for
the
success
of
this
loan
and
the
contemplated
reforms
which
are
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
commercial
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
civilized
world
at
large
it
is
realized
that
an
expert
will
be
necessary
and
this
government
has
received
assurances
from
china
that
such
an
adviser
who
shall
be
an
american
will
be
engaged
it
is
a
matter
of
interest
to

note
the
success
which
is
attending
the
efforts
of
china
to
establish
gradually
a

alike
solemnly
committed

the
final
step
in
a
process

her
powerful
neighbor

has
been
in
progress
for
several
years
past

in

special

were
sent
from
this
country
to
argentina

the
gracious

manifested
the
cordial

relations
which
i
am
happy
to
believe
have
never
before
been
upon
so
high
a
plane

so
solid
a
basis
as
at

the
congressional
commission
appointed
under
a
concurrent
resolution
to
attend
the
festivities
celebrating
the
centennial
anniversary
of
mexican
independence
together
with
a

cordiality
and
returned
with
the
report
of
the
bounteous
hospitality
and
warm
reception
of
president
diaz
and
the
mexican
people
which
left
no
doubt
of
the
desire
of
the
immediately
neighboring
republic
to
continue
the
mutually
beneficial
and
intimate
relations
which
i
feel
sure
the
two
governments
will
ever
cherish
at
the
fourth
panamerican
conference
which
met
in
buenos
aires
during
july
and
august
last
after
seven
weeks
of
harmonious
deliberation
three
conventions
were
signed
providing
for
the
regulation
of
trademarks
patents
and
copyrights
which
when
ratified
by
the
different
governments
will
go
far
toward
furnishing
to
american
authors
patentees
and
owners
of
trademarks
the
protection
needed
in
localities
where
heretofore
it
has
been
either
lacking
or
inadequate
further
a
convention
for
the
arbitration
of
pecuniary
claims
was
signed
and
a
number
of
important
resolutions
passed
the
conventions
will
in
due
course
be
transmitted
to
the
senate
and
the
report
of
the
delegation
of
the
united
states
will
be
communicated
to
the
congress
for
its
information
the
special
cordiality
between
representative
men
from
all
parts
of
america
which
was
shown
at
this
conference
cannot
fail
to
react
upon
and
draw
still
closer
the
relations
between
the
countries
which
took
part
in
it
the
international
bureau
of
american
republics
is
doing
a
broad
and
useful
work
for
pan
american
commerce
and
comity
its
duties
were
much
enlarged
by
the
international
conference
of
american
states
at
buenos
aires
and
its
name
was
shortened
to
the
more
practical
and
expressive
term
of
pan
american
union
located
now
in
its
new
building
which
was
specially
dedicated
april
of
this
year
to
the
development
of
friendship
trade
and
peace
among
the
american
nations
it
has
improved
instrumentalities
to
serve
the
twentytwo
republics
of
this
hemisphere
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
action
of
the
united
states
in
its
desire
to
remove
imminent
danger
of
war
between
peru
and
ecuador
growing
out
of
a
boundary
dispute
with
the
cooperation
of
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
as
joint
mediators
with
this
government
has
already
resulted
successfully
in
preventing
war
the
government
of
chile
while
not
one
of
the
mediators
lent
effective
aid
in
furtherance
of
a
preliminary
agreement
likely
to
lead
on
to
an
amicable
settlement
and
it
is
not
doubted
that
the
good
offices
of
the
mediating
powers
and
the
conciliatory
cooperation
of
the
governments
directly
interested
will
finally
lead
to
a
removal
of
this
perennial
cause
of
friction
between
ecuador
and
peru
the
inestimable
value
of
cordial
cooperation
between
the
sister
republics
of
america
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
in
this
hemisphere
has
never
been
more
clearly
shown
than
in
this
mediation
by
which
three
american
governments
have
given
to
this
hemisphere
the
honor
of
first
invoking
the
most
farreaching
provisions
of
the
hague
convention
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
disputes
there
has
been
signed
by
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
a
protocol
submitting
to
the
united
statesmexican
boundary
commission
whose
membership
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
is
to
be
increased
by
the
addition
of
a
citizen

question
of
sovereignty
over
the
chamizal
tract
which
lies
within
the
present
physical
boundaries
of

on
which
long
ago
fell
in
arrears
finally
conditions
were
such
that
it
became
imperative
to
refund
the
debt
and
place
the
finances
of
the
republic
upon
a
sound
basis
last
year
a
group
of
american
bankers
undertook
to
do
this
and
to
advance
funds
for
railway
and
other
improvements
contributing
directly
to
the
countrys
prosperity
and
commercean
arrangement
which
has
long
been
desired
by
this
government
negotiations
to
this
end
have
been
under
way
for
more
than
a
year
and
it
is
now
confidently
believed
that
a
short
tim
e
will
suffice
to
conclude
an
arrangement
which
will
be
satisfactory
to
the
foreign
creditors
eminently
advantageous
to
honduras
and
highly
creditable
to
the
judgment
and
foresight
of
the
honduranean
government
this
is
much
to
be
desired
since
as
recognized
by
the
washington
conventions
a
strong
honduras
would
tend
immensely
to
the
progress
and
prosperity
of
central
america
during
the
past
year
the
republic
of
nicaragua
has
been
the
scene
of
internecine
struggle
general
zelaya
for
seventeen
years
the
absolute
ruler
of
nicaragua
was
throughout
his
career
the
disturber
of
central
america
and
opposed
every
plan
for
the
promotion
of
peace
and
friendly
relations
between
the
five
republics
when
the
people
of
nicaragua
were
finally
driven
into
rebellion
by
his
lawless
exactions
he
violated
the
laws
of
war
by
the
unwarranted
execution
of
two
american
citizens
who
had
regularly
enlisted
in
the
ranks
of
the
revolutionists
this
and
other
offenses
made
it
the
duty
of
the
american
government
to
take
measures
with
a
view
to
ultimate
reparation
and
for
the
safeguarding
of
its
interests
this
involved
the
breaking
off
of
all
diplomatic
relations
with
the
zelaya
government
for
the
reasons
laid
down
in
a
communication
from
the
secretary
of
state
which
also
notified
the
contending
factions
in
nicaragua
that
this
government
would
hold
each
to
strict
accountability
for
outrages
on
the
rights
of
american
citizens
american
forces
were
sent
to
both
coasts
of
nicaragua
to
be
in
readiness
should
occasion
arise
to
protect
americans
and
their
interests
and
remained
there
until
the
war
was
over
and
peace
had
returned
to
that
unfortunate
country
these
events
together
with
zelayas
continued
exactions
brought
him
so
clearly
to
the
bar
of
public
opinion
that
he
was
forced
to
resign
and
to
take
refuge
abroad
in
the
abovementioned
communication
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
charge
daffaires
of
the
zelaya
government
the
opinion
was
expressed
that
the
revolution
represented
the
wishes
of
the
majority
of
the
nicaraguan
people
this
has
now
been
proved
beyond
doubt
by
the
fact
that
since
the
complete
overthrow
of
the
madriz
government
and
the
occupation
of
the
capital
by
the
forces
of
the
revolution
all
factions
have
united
to
maintain
public
order
and
as
a
result
of
discussion
with
an
agent
of
this
government
sent
to
managua
at
the
request
of
the
provisional
government
comprehensive
plans
are
being
made
for
the
future
welfare
of
nicaragua
including
the
rehabilitation
of
public
credit
the
moderation
and
conciliatory
spirit
shown
by
the
various
factions
give
ground
for
the
confident
hope
that
nicaragua
will
soon
take
its
rightful
place
among
the
lawabiding
and
progressive
countries
of
the
world
it
gratifies
me
exceedingly
to
announce
that
the
argentine
republic
some
months
ago
placed
with
american
manufacturers
a
contract
for
the
construction
of
two
battleships
and
certain
additional
naval
equipment
the
extent
of
this
work
and
its
importance
to
the
argentine
republic
make
the
placing
of
the
bid
an
earnest
of
friendly
feeling
toward
the
united
states
tariff
negotiations
the
new
tariff
law
in
section
respecting
the
maximum
and
minimum
tariffs
of
the
united
states
which
provisions
came
into
effect
on
april
imposed
upon
the
president
the
responsibility
of
determining
prior
to
that
date
whether
or
not
any
undue
discrimination
existed
against
the
united
states
and
its
products
in
any
country
of
the
world
with
which
we
sustained
commercial
relations
in
the
case
of
several
countries
instances
of
apparent
undue
discrimination
against
american
commerce
were
found
to
exist
these
discriminations
were
removed
by
negotiation
prior
to
april
when
the
maximum
tariff
was
to
come
into
operation
with
respect
to
importations
from
all
those
countries
in
whose
favor
no
proclamation
applying
the
minimum
tariff
should
be
issued
by
the
president
one
hundred
and
thirtyfour
such
proclamations
were
issued
this
series
of
proclamations
embraced
the
entire
commercial
world
and
hence
the
minimum
tariff
of
the
united
states
has
been
given
universal
application
thus
testifying
to
the
satisfactory
character
of
our
trade
relations
with
foreign
countries
marked
advantages
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
were
obtained
through
these
tariff
settlements
foreign
nations
are
fully
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
under
section
of
the
tariff
act
the
president
is
required
whenever
he
is
satisfied
that
the
treatment
accorded
by
them
to
the
products
of
the
united
states
is
not
such
as
to
entitle
them
to
the
benefits
of
the
minimum
tariff
of
the
united
states
to
withdraw
those
benefits
by
proclamation
giving
ninety
days
notice
after
which
the
maximum
tariff
will
apply
to
their
dutiable
products
entering
the
united
states
in
its
general
operation
this
section
of
the
tariff
law
has
thus
far
proved
a
guaranty
of
continued
commercial
peace
although
there
are
unfortunately
instances
where
foreign
governments
deal
arbitrarily
with
american
interests
within
their
jurisdiction
in
a
manner
injurious
and
inequitable
the
policy
of
broader
and
closer
trade
relations
with
the
dominion
of
canada
which
was
initiated
in
the
adjustment
of
the
maximum
and
minimum
provisions
of
the
tariff
act
of
august
has
proved
mutually
beneficial
it
justifies
further
efforts
for
the
readjustment
of
the
commercial
relations
of
the
two
countries
so
that
their
commerce
may
follow
the
channels
natural
to
contiguous
countries
and
be
commensurate
with
the
steady
expansion
of
trade
and
industry
on
both
sides
of
the
boundary
line
the
reciprocation
on
the
part
of
the
dominion
government
of
the
sentiment
which
was
expressed
by
this
government
was
followed
in
october
by
the
suggestion
that
it
would
be
glad
to
have
the
negotiations
which
had
been
temporarily
suspended
during
the
summer
resumed
in
accordance
with
this
suggestion
the
secretary
of
state
by
my
direction
dispatched
two
representatives
of
the
department
of
state
as
special
commissioners
to
ottawa
to
confer
with
representatives
of
the
dominion
government
they
were
authorized
to
take
such
steps
for
formulating
a
reciprocal
trade
agreement
as
might
be
necessary
and
to
receive
and
consider
any
propositions
which
the
dominion
government
might
care
to
submit
pursuant
to
the
instructions
issued
conferences
were
held
by
these
commissioners
with
officials
of
the
dominion
government
at
ottawa
in
the
early
part
of
november
the
negotiations
were
conducted
on
both
sides
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
accommodation
the
discussion
of
the
common
commercial
interests
of
the
two
countries
had
for
its
object
a
satisfactory
basis
for
a
trade
arrangement
which
offers
the
prospect
of
a
freer
interchange
for
the
products
of
the
united
states
and
of
canada
the
conferences
were
adjourned
to
be
resumed
in
washington
in
january
when
it
is
hoped
that
the
aspiration
of
both
governments
for
a
mutually
advantageous
measure
of
reciprocity
will
be
realized
fostering
foreign
trade
all
these
tariff
negotiations
so
vital
to
our
commerce
and
industry
and
the
duty
of
jealously
guarding
the
equitable
and
just
treatment
of
our
products
capital
and
industry
abroad
devolve
upon
the
department
of
state
the
argentine
battleship
contracts
like
the
subsequent
important
one
for
argentine
railway
equipment
and
those
for
cuban
government
vessels
were
secured
for
our
manufacturers
largely
through
the
good
offices
of
the
department
of
state
the
efforts
of
that
department
to
secure
for
citizens
of
the
united
states
equal
opportunities
in
the
markets
of
the
world
and
to
expand
american
commerce
have
been
most
successful
the
volume
of
business
obtained
in
new
fields
of
competition
and
upon
new
lines
is
already
very
great
and
congress
is
urged
to
continue
to
support
the
department
of
state
in
its
endeavors
for
further
trade
expansion
our
foreign
trade
merits
the
best
support
of
the
government
and
the
most
earnest
endeavor
of
our
manufacturers
and
merchants
who
if
they
do
not
already
in
all
cases
need
a
foreign
market
are
certain
soon
to
become
dependent
on
it
therefore
now
is
the
time
to
secure
a
strong
position
in
this
field
american
branch
banks
abroad
i
cannot
leave
this
subject
without
emphasizing
the
necessity
of
such
legislation
as
will
make
possible
and
convenient
the
establishment
of
american
banks
and
branches
of
american
banks
in
foreign
countries
only
by
such
means
can
our
foreign
trade
be
favorably
financed
necessary
credits
be
arranged
and
proper
avail
be
made
of
commercial
opportunities
in
foreign
countries
and
most
especially
in
latin
america
aid
to
our
foreign
merchant
marine
another
instrumentality
indispensable
to
the
unhampered
and
natural
development
of
american
commerce
is
merchant
marine
all
maritime
and
commercial
nations
recognize
the
importance
of
this
factor
the
greatest
commercial
nations
our
competitors
jealously
foster
their
merchant
marine
perhaps
nowhere
is
the
need
for
rapid
and
direct
mail
passenger
and
freight
communication
quite
so
urgent
as
between
the
united
states
and
latin
america
we
can
secure
in
no
other
quarter
of
the
world
such
immediate
benefits
in
friendship
and
commerce
as
would
flow
from
the
establishment
of
direct
lines
of
communication
with
the
countries
of
latin
america
adequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
a
rapidly
increasing
appreciation
of
the
reciprocal
dependence
of
the
countries
of
the
western
hemisphere
upon
each
others
products
sympathies
and
assistance
i
alluded
to
this
most
important
subject
in
my
last
annual
message
it
has
often
been
before
you
and
i
need
not
recapitulate
the
reasons
for
its
recommendation
unless
prompt
action
be
taken
the
completion
of
the
panama
canal
will
find
this
the
only
great
commercial
nation
unable
to
avail
in
international
maritime
business
of
this
great
improvement
in
the
means
of
the
worlds
commercial
intercourse
quite
aside
from
the
commercial
aspect
unless
we
create
a
merchant
marine
where
can
we
find
the
seafaring
population
necessary
as
a
natural
naval
reserve
and
where
could
we
find
in
case
of
war
the
transports
and
subsidiary
vessels
without
which

a
naval
fleet
is
arms
without
a
body
for
many
reasons
i
cannot
too
strongly
urge
upon
the
congress
the
passage
of
a
measure
by
mail
subsidy
or
other
subvention
adequate
to
guarantee
the
establishment
and
rapid
development
of
an
american
merchant
marine
and
the
restoration
of
the
american
flag
to
its
ancient
place
upon
the
seas
of
course
such
aid
ought
only
to
be
given
under
conditions
of
publicity
of
each
beneficiarys
business
and
accounts
which
would
show
that
the
aid
received
was
needed
to
maintain
the
trade
and
was
properly
used
for
that
purpose
federal
protection
to
aliens
with
our
increasing
international
intercourse
it
becomes
incumbent
upon
me
to
repeat
more
emphatically
than
ever
the
recommendation
which
i
made
in
my
inaugural
address
that
congress
shall
at
once
give
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
jurisdiction
to
punish
as
a
crime
the
violation
of
the
rights
of
aliens
secured
by
treaty
with
the
united
states
in
order
that
the
general
government
of
the
united
states
shall
be
able
when
called
upon
by
a
friendly
nation
to
redeem
its
solemn
promise
by
treaty
to
secure
to
the
citizens
or
subjects
of
that
nation
resident
in
the
united
states
freedom
from
violence
and
due
process
of
law
in
respect
to
their
life
liberty
and
property
merit
system
for
diplomatic
and
consular
service
i
also
strongly
commend
to
the
favorable
action
of
the
congress
the
enactment
of
a
law
applying
to
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
the
principles
embodied
in
section
of
the
revised
statutes
of
the
united
states
in
the
civil
service
act
of
january
and
the
executive
orders
of
june
and
of
november
the
excellent
results
which
have
attended
the
partial
application
of
civil
service
principles
to
the
diplomatic
and
consular
services
are
an
earnest
of
the
benefit
to
be
wrought
by
a
wider
and
more
permanent
extension
of
those
principles
to
both
branches
of
the
foreign
service
the
marked
improvement
in
the
consular
service
during
the
four
years
since
the
principles
of
the
civil
service
act
were
applied
to
that
service
in
a
limited
way
and
the
good
results
already
noticeable
from
a
similar
application
of
civil
service
principles
to
the
diplomatic
service
a
year
ago
convince
me
that
the
enactment
into
law
of
the
general
principles
of
the
existing
executive
regulations
could
not
fail
to
effect
further
improvement
of
both
branches
of
the
foreign
service
offering
as
it
would
by
its
assurance
of
permanency
of
tenure
and
promotion
on
merit
an
inducement
for
the
entry
of
capable
young
men
into
the
service
and
an
incentive
to
those
already
in
to
put
forth
their
best
efforts
to
attain
and
maintain
that
degree
of
efficiency
which
the
interests
of
our
international
relations
and
commerce
demand
government
ownership
of
our
embassy
and
legation
premises
during
many
years
past
appeals
have
been
made
from
time
to
time
to
congress
in
favor
of
government
ownership
of
embassy
and
legation
premises
abroad
the
arguments
in
favor
of
such
ownership
have
been
many
and
oft
repeated
and
are
well
known
to
the
congress
the
acquisition
by
the
government
of
suitable
residences
and
offices
for
its
diplomatic
officers
especially
in
the
capitals
of
the
latinamerican
states
and
of
europe
is
so
important
and
necessary
to
an
improved
diplomatic
service
that
i
have
no
hesitation
in
urging
upon
the
congress
the
passage
of
some
measure
similar
to
that
favorably
reported
by
the
house
committee
on
foreign
affairs
on
february
report
no
that
would
authorize
the
gradual
and
annual
acquisition
of
premises
for
diplomatic
use
the
work
of
the
diplomatic
service
is
devoid
of
partisanship
its
importance
should
appeal
to
every
american
citizen
and
should
receive
the
generous
consideration
of
the
congress
treasury
department
estimates
for
next
years
expenses
every
effort
has
been
made
by
each
department
chief
to
reduce
the
estimated
cost
of
his
department
for
the
ensuing
fiscal
year
ending
june
i
say
this
in
order
that
congress
may
understand
that
these
estimates
thus
made
present
the
smallest
sum
which
will
maintain
the
departments
bureaus
and
offices
of
the
government
and
meet
its
other
obligations
under
existing
law
and
that
a
cut
of
these
estimates
would
result
in
embarrassing
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
in
the
performance
of
its
duties
this
remark
does
not
apply
to
the
river
and
harbor
estimates
except
to
those
for
expenses
of
maintenance
and
the
meeting
of
obligations
under
authorized
contracts
nor
does
it
apply
to
the
public
building
bill
nor
to
the
navy
building
program
of
course
as
to
these
congress
could
withhold
any
part
or
all
of
the
estimates
for
them
without
interfering
with
the
discharge
of
the
ordinary
obligations
of
the
government
or
the
performance
of
the
functions
of
its
departments
bureaus
and
offices
a
fiftytwo
million
cut
the
final
estimates
for
the
year
ending
june
as
they
have
been
sent
to
the
treasury
on
november
of
this
year
for
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
including
those
for
public
buildings
rivers
and
harbors
and
the
navy
building
program
amount
to
this
is
less
than
the
appropriations
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
it
is
less
than
the
total
estimates
including
supplemental
estimates
submitted
to
congress
by
the
treasury
for
the
year
and
is
less
than
the
original
estimates
submitted
by
the
treasury
for
these
figures
do
not
include
the
appropriations
for
the
panama
canal
the
policy
in
respect
to
which
ought
to
be
and
is
to
spend
as
much
each
year
as
can
be
economically
and
effectively
expended
in
order
to
complete
the
canal
as
promptly
as
possible
and
therefore
the
ordinary
motive
for
cutting
down
the
expense
of
the
government
does
not
apply
to
appropriations
for
this
purpose
it
will
be
noted
that
the
estimates
for
the
panama
canal
for
the
ensuing
year
are
more
than
fiftysix
millions
of
dollars
an
increase
of
twenty
millions
over
the
amount
appropriated
for
this
yeara
difference
due
to
the
fact
that
the
estimates
for
include
something
over
nineteen
millions
for
the
fortification
of
the
canal
against
the
estimated
expenditures
of
the
treasury
has
estimated
receipts
for
next
year
making
a
probable
surplus
of
ordinary
receipts
over
ordinary

typical
economies
the
treasury
department
is
one
of
the
original
departments
of
the
government
with
the
changes
in
the
monetary
system
made
from
time
to
time
and
with
the
creation
of
national
banks
it
was
thought
necessary
to
organize
new
bureaus
and
divisions
which
were
added
in
a
somewhat
haphazard
way
and
resulted
in
a
duplication
of
duties
which
might
well
now
be
ended
this
lack
of
system
and
economic
coordination
has
attracted
the
attention
of
the
head
of
that
department
who
has
been
giving
his
time
for
the
last
two
years
with
the
aid
of
experts
and
by
consulting
his
bureau
chiefs
to
its
reformation
he
has
abolished
four
hundred
places
in
the
civil
service
without
at
all
injuring
its
efficiency
merely
to
illustrate
the
character
of
the
reforms
that
are
possible
i
shall
comment
on
some
of
the
specific
changes
that
are
being
made
or
ought
to
be
made
by
legislative
aid
auditing
system
the
auditing
system
in
vogue
is
as
old
as
the
government
and
the
methods
used
are
antiquated
there
are
six
auditors
and
seven
assistant
auditors
for
the
nine
departments
and
under
the
present
system
the
only
function
which
the
auditor
of
a
department
exercises
is
to
determine
on
accounts
presented
by
disbursing
officers
that
the
object
of
the
expenditure
was
within
the
law
and
the
appropriation
made
by
congress
for
the
purpose
on
its
face
and
that
the
calculations
in
the
accounts
are
correct
he
does
not
examine
the
merits
of
the
transaction
or
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
price
paid
for
the
articles
purchased
nor
does
he
furnish
any
substantial
check
upon
disbursing
officers
and
the
heads
of
departments
or
bureaus
with
sufficient
promptness
to
enable
the
government
to
recoup
itself
in
full
measure
for
unlawful
expenditure
a
careful
plan
is
being
devised
and
will
be
presented
to
congress
with
the
recommendation
that
the
force
of
auditors
and
employees
under
them
be
greatly
reduced
thereby
effecting
substantial
economy
but
this
economy
will
be
small
compared
with
the
larger
economy
that
can
be
effected
by
consolidation
and
change
of
methods
the
possibilities
in
this
regard
have
been
shown
in
the
reduction
of
expenses
and
the
importance
of
methods
and
efficiency
in
the
office
of
the
auditor
for
the
post

department
who
without
in
the

degree
impairing

been
a
cause

seventy
years
the
interests
involved
are
of
great
importance
to

and
the
final
settlement
of

will
remove

within

the

were

as

failed
to
agree
within
six
months
after
the
exchange
of
the

statements
as
required

it
has
now
become

commission
appointed
pursuant

the
apportionment
between

and
to
make

for

are
now
engaged
in

work
negotiations
for

protection
of
the
fur
seals
in
the
north
pacific
are
in
progress
with
the
governments
of
great
britain
japan
and
russia
the
attitude
of
the
governments
interested
leads
me
to
hope
for
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
this
question
as
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
negotiations
the
second
peace
conference
recently
held
at
the
hague
adopted
a
convention
for
the
establishment
of
an
international
prize
court
upon
the
joint
proposal
of
delegations
of
the
united
states
france
germany
and
great
britain
the
law
to
be
observed
by
the
tribunal
in
the
decision
of
prize
cases
was
however
left
in
an
uncertain
and
therefore
unsatisfactory
state
article
of
the
convention
provided
that
the
court
was
to
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
treaties
existing
between
the
belligerents
but
that
in
the
absence
of
such
provisions
the
court
shall
apply
the
rules
of
international
law
if
no
generally
recognized
rule
exists
the
court
shall
give
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
of
justice
and
equity
as
however
many
questions
in
international
maritime
law
are
understood
differently
and
therefore
interpreted
differently
in
various
countries
it
was
deemed
advisable
not
to
intrust
legislative
powers
to
the
proposed
court
but
to
determine
the
rules
of
law
properly
applicable
in
a
conference
of
the
representative
maritime
nations
pursuant
to
an
invitation
of
great
britain
a
conference
was
held
at
london
from
december
to
february
in
which
the
following
powers
participated
the
united
states
austriahungary
france
germany
great
britain
italy
japan
the
netherlands
russia
and
spain
the
conference
resulted
in
the
declaration
of
london
unanimously
agreed
to
and
signed
by
the
participating
powers
concerning
among
other
matters
the
highly
important
subjects
of
blockade
contraband
the
destruction
of
neutral
prizes
and
continuous
voyages
the
declaration
of
london
is
an
eminently
satisfactory
codification
of
the
international
maritime
law
and
it
is
hoped
that
its
reasonableness
and
fairness
will
secure
its
general
adoption
as
well
as
remove
one
of
the
difficulties
standing
in
the
way
of
the
establishment
of
an
international
prize
court
under
the
authority
given
in
the
sundry
civil
appropriation
act
approved
march
the
united

was
represented
at
the
international
conference
on
maritime
law
at
brussels
the
conference
met
on
the
th
of
september
last
and
resulted
in
the
signature
ad
referendum
of
a
convention
for
the
unification
of
certain
regulations
with
regard
to
maritime
assistance
and
salvage
and
a
convention
for
the
unification
of
certain
rules
with
regard
to
collisions
at

two
new
projects
of
conventions
which
have
not
heretofore
been
considered
in
a
diplomatic
conference
namely
one
concerning
the
limitation
of
the
responsibility
of
shipowners
and
the
other
concerning
marine
mortgages
and
privileges
have
been
submitted
by
the
conference
to
the
different
governments
the
conference
adjourned
to
meet
again
on
april
the
international
conference
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
uniform
legislation
concerning
letters
of
exchange
which
was
called
by
the
government
of
the
netherlands
to
meet
at
the
hague
in
september
has
been
postponed
to
meet
at
that
capital
in
june
the
united
states
will
be
appropriately
represented
in
this
conference
under
the
provision
therefor
already
made
by
congress
the
cordial
invitation
of
belgium
to
be
represented
by
a
fitting
display
of
american
progress
in
the
useful
arts
and
inventions
at
the
worlds
fair
to
be
held
at
brussels
in
remains
to
be
acted
upon
by
the
congress
mindful
of
the
advantages
to
accrue
to
our
artisans
and
producers
in
competition
with
their
continental
rivals
i
renew
the
recommendation
heretofore
made
that
provision
be
made
for
acceptance
of
the
invitation
and
adequate
representation
in
the
exposition
the
question
arising
out
of
the
belgian
annexation
of
the
independent
state
of
the
congo
which
has
so
long
and
earnestly
preoccupied
the
attention
of
this
government
and
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
our
best
citizens
is
still
open
but
in
a
more
hopeful
stage
this
government
was
among
the
foremost
in
the
great
work
of
uplifting
the
uncivilized
regions
of
africa
and
urging
the
extension
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
education
and
fruitful
open
commerce
to
that
vast
domain
and
is
a
party
to
treaty
engagements
of
all
the
interested
powers
designed
to
carry
out
that
great
duty
to
humanity
the
way
to
better
the
original
and
adventitious
conditions
so
burdensome
to
the
natives
and
so
destructive
to
their
development
has
been
pointed
out
by
observation
and
experience
not
alone
of
american
representatives
but
by
cumulative
evidence
from
all
quarters
and
by
the
investigations
of
belgian
agents
the
announced
programmes
of
reforms
striking
at
many
of
the
evils
known
to
exist
are
an
augury
of
better
things
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
is
one
of
benevolent
encouragement
coupled
with
a
hopeful
trust
that
the
good
work
responsibly
undertaken
and
zealously
perfected
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
results
so
ardently
desired
will
soon
justify
the
wisdom
that
inspires
them
and
satisfy
the
demands
of
humane
sentiment
throughout
the
world
a
convention
between
the
united
states
and
germany
under
which
the
nonworking
provisions
of
the
german
patent
law
are
made
inapplicable
to
the
patents
of
american
citizens
was
concluded
on
february
and
is
now
in
force
negotiations
for
similar
conventions
looking
to
the
placing
of
american
inventors
on
the
same
footing
as
nationals
have
recently
been
initiated
with
other
european
governments
whose
laws
require
the
local
working
of
foreign
patents
under
an
appropriation
made
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
a
commission
was
sent
on
american
cruisers
to
monrovia
to
investigate
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
its
citizens
in
liberia
upon
its
arrival
at
monrovia
the
commission
was
enthusiastically
received
and
during
its
stay
in
liberia
was
everywhere
met
with
the
heartiest
expressions
of
good
will
for
the
american
government
and
people
and
the
hope
was
repeatedly
expressed
on
all
sides
that
this
government
might
see
its
way
clear
to
do
something
to
relieve
the
critical
position
of
the
republic
arising
in
a
measure
from
external
as
well
as
internal
and
financial
embarrassments
the
liberian
government
afforded
every
facility
to
the
commission
for
ascertaining
the
true
state
of
affairs
the
commission
also
had
conferences
with
representative
citizens
interested
foreigners
and
the
representatives
of
foreign
governments
in
monrovia
visits
were
made
to
various
parts
of
the
republic
and
to
the
neighboring
british
colony
of
sierra
leone
where
the
commission
was
received
by
and
conferred
with
the
gov
ernor
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
republic
of
liberia
springs
from
the
historical
fact
of
the
foundation
of
the
republic
by
the
colonization
of
american
citizens
of
the
african
race
in
an
early
treaty
with
liberia
there
is
a
provision
under
which
the
united
states
may
be
called
upon
for
advice
or
assistance
pursuant
to
this
provision
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
moral
relationship
of
the
united
states
to
liberia
that
republic
last
year
asked
this
government
to
lend
assistance
in
the
solution
of
certain
of
their
national
problems
and
hence
the
commission
was
sent
the
report
of
our
commissioners
has
just
been
completed
and
is
now
under
examination
by
the
department
of
state
it
is
hoped
that
there
may
result
some
helpful
measures
in
which
case
it
may
be
my
duty
again
to
invite
your
attention
to
this
subject
the
norwegian
government
by
a
note
addressed
on
january
to
the
department
of
state
conveyed
an
invitation
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
take
part
in
a
conference
which
it
is
understood
will
be
held
in
february
or
march
for
the
purpose
of
devising
means
to
remedy
existing
conditions
in
the
spitzbergen
islands
this
invitation
was
conveyed
under
the
reservation
that
the
question
of
altering
the
status
of
the
islands
as
countries
belonging
to
no
particular
state
and
as
equally
open
to
the
citizens
and
subjects
of
all
states
should
not
be
raised
the
european
powers
invited
to
this
conference
by
the
government
of
norway
were
belgium
denmark
france
germany
great
britain
russia
sweden
and
the
netherlands
the
department
of
state
in
view
of
proofs
filed
with
it
in
showing
the
american
possession
occupation
and
working
of
certain
coalbearing
lands
in
spitzbergen
accepted
the
invitation
under
the
reservation
above
stated
and
under
the
further
reservation
that
all
interests
in
those
islands
already
vested
should
be
protected
and
that
there
should
be
equality
of
opportunity
for
the
future
it
was
further
pointed
out
that
membership
in
the
conference
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
was
qualified
by
the
consideration
that
this
government
would
not
become
a
signatory
to
any
conventional
arrangement
concluded
by
the
european
members
of
the
conference
which
would
imply
contributory
participation
by
the
united
states
in
any
obligation
or
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
any
scheme
of
administration
which
might
be
devised
by
the
conference
for
the
islands
the
near
east
his
majesty
mehmed
v
sultan
of
turkey
recently
sent
to
this
country
a
special
embassy
to
announce
his
accession
the
quick
transition
of
the
government
of
the
ottoman
empire
from
one
of
retrograde
tendencies
to
a
constitutional
government
with
a
parliament
and
with
progressive
modern
policies
of
reform
and
public
improvement
is
one
of
the
important
phenomena
of
our
times
constitutional
government
seems
also
to
have
made
further
advance
in
persia
these
events
have
turned
the
eyes
of
the
world
upon
the
near
east
in
that
quarter
the
prestige
of
the
united
states
has
spread
widely
through
the
peaceful
influence
of
american
schools
universities
and
missionaries
there
is
every
reason
why
we
should
obtain
a
greater
share
of
the
commerce
of
the
near
east
since
the
conditions
are
more
favorable
now
than
ever
before
latin
america
one
of
the
happiest
events
in
recent
panamerican
diplomacy
was
the
pacific
independent
settlement
by
the
governments
of
bolivia
and
peru
of
a
boundary
difference
between
them
which
for
some
weeks
threatened
to
cause
war
and
even
to
entrain
embitterments
affecting
other
republics
less
directly
concerned
from
various
quarters
directly
or
indirectly
concerned
the
intermediation
of
the
united
states
was
sought
to
assist
in
a
solution
of
the
controversy
desiring
at
all
times
to
abstain
from
any
undue
mingling
in
the
affairs
of
sister
republics
and
having
faith
in
the
ability
of
the
governments
of
peru
and
bolivia
themselves
to
settle
their
differences
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
themselves
which
viewed
with
magnanimity
would
assuage
all
embitterment
this
government
steadily
abstained
from
being
drawn
into
the
controversy
and
was
much
gratified
to
find
its
confidence
justified
by
events
on
the
th
of
july
next
there
will
open
at
buenos
aires
the
fourth
panamerican
conference
this
conference
will
have
a
special
meaning
to
the
hearts
of
all
americans
because
around
its
date
are
clustered
the
anniversaries
of
the
independence
of
so
many
of
the
american
republics
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
remind
the
congress
of
the
political
social
and
commercial
importance
of
these
gatherings
you
are
asked
to
make
liberal
appropriation
for
our
participation
if
this
be
granted
it
is
my
purpose
to
appoint
a
distinguished
and
representative
delegation
qualified
fittingly
to
represent
this
country
and
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
intercontinental
interest
which
will
there
be
discussed
the
argentine
republic
will
also
hold
from
may
to
november
at
buenos
aires
a
great
international
agricultural
exhibition
in
which
the
united
states
has
been
invited
to
participate
considering
the
rapid
growth
of
the
trade
of
the
united
states
with
the
argentine
republic
and
the
cordial
relations
existing
between
the
two
nations
together
with
the
fact
that
it
provides
an
opportunity
to
show
deference
to
a
sister
republic
on
the
occasion
of
the
celebration
of
its
national
independence
the
proper
departments
of
this
government
are
taking
steps
to
apprise
the
interests
concerned
of
the
opportunity
afforded
by
this
exhibition
in
which
appropriate
participation
by
this
country
is
so
desirable
the
designation
of
an
official
representative
is
also
receiving
consideration
today
more
than
ever
before
american
capital
is
seeking
investment
in
foreign
countries
and
american
products
are
more
and
more
generally
seeking
foreign
markets
as
a
consequence
in
all
countries
there
are
american
citizens
and
american
interests
to
be
protected
on
occasion
by
their
government
these
movements
of
men
of
capital
and
of
commodities
bring
peoples
and
governments
closer
together
and
so
form
bonds
of
peace
and
mutual
dependency
as
they
must
also
naturally
sometimes
make
passing
points
of
friction
the
resultant
situation
inevitably
imposes
upon
this
government
vastly
increased
responsibilities
this
administration
through
the
department
of
state
and
the
foreign
service
is
lending
all
proper
support
to
legitimate
and
beneficial
american
enterprises
in
foreign
countries
the
degree
of
such
support
being
measured
by
the
national
advantages
to
be
expected
a
citizen
himself
can
not
by
contract
or
otherwise
divest
himself
of
the
right
nor
can
this
government
escape
the
obligation
of
his
protection
in
his
personal
and
property
rights
when
these
are
unjustly
infringed
in
a
foreign
country
to
avoid
ceaseless
vexations
it
is
proper
that
in
considering
whether
american
enterprise
should
be
encouraged
or
supported
in
a
particular
country
the
government
should
give
full
weight
not
only
to
the
national
as
opposed
to
the
individual
benefits
to
accrue
but
also
to
the
fact
whether
or
not
the
government
of
the
country
in
question
is
in
its
administration
and
in
its
diplomacy
faithful
to
the
principles
of
moderation
equity
and
justice
upon
which
alone
depend
international
credit
in
diplomacy
as
well
as
in
finance
the
panamerican
policy
of
this
government
has
long
been
fixed
in
its
principles
and
remains
unchanged
with
the
changed
circumstances
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
republics
to
the
south
of
us
most
of
which
have
great
natural
resources
stable
government
and
progressive
ideals
the
apprehension
which
gave
rise
to
the
monroe
doctrine
may
be
said
to
have
nearly
disappeared
and
neither
the
doctrine
as
it
exists
nor
any
other
doctrine
of
american
policy
should
be
permitted
to
operate
for
the
perpetuation
of
irresponsible
government
the
escape
of
just
obligations
or
the
insidious
allegation
of
dominating
ambitions
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
beside
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
our
panamerican
policy
there
have
grown
up
a
realization
of
political
interests
community
of
institutions
and
ideals
and
a
flourishing
commerce
all
these
bonds
will
be
greatly
strengthened
as
time
goes
on
and
increased
facilities
such
as
the
great
bank
soon
to
be
established
in
latin
america
supply
the
means
for
building
up
the
colossal
intercontinental
commerce
of
the
future
my
meeting
with
president
diaz
and
the
greeting
exchanged
on
both
american
and
mexican
soil
served
i
hope
to
signalize
the
close
and
cordial
relations
which
so
well
bind
together
this
republic
and
the
great
republic
immediately
to
the
south
between
which
there
is
so
vast
a
network
of
material
interests
i
am
happy
to
say
that
all
but
one
of
the
cases
which
for
so
long
vexed
our
relations
with
venezuela
have
been
settled
within
the
past
few
months
and
that
under
the
enlightened
regime
now
directing
the
government
of
venezuela
provision
has
been
made
for
arbitration
of
the
remaining
case
before
the
hague
tribunal
on
july
the
government
of
panama
agreed
after
considerable
negotiation
to
indemnify
the
relatives
of
the
american
officers
and
sailors
who
were
brutally
treated
one
of
them
having
indeed
been
killed
by
the
panaman
police
this
year
the
sincere
desire
of
the
government
of
panama
to
do
away
with
a
situation
where
such
an
accident
could
occur
is
manifest
in
the
recent
request
in
compliance
with
which
this
government
has
lent
the
services
of
an
officer
of
the
army
to
be
employed
by
the
government
of
panama
as
instructor
of
police
the
sanitary
improvements
and
public
works
undertaken
in
cuba
prior
to
the
present
administration
of
that
government
in
the
success
of
which
the
united
states
is
interested
under
the
treaty
are
reported
to
be
making
good
progress
and
since
the
congress
provided
for
the
continuance
of
the
reciprocal
commercial
arrangement
between
cuba
and
the
united
states
assurance
has
been
received
that
no
negotiations
injuriously
affecting
the
situation
will
be
undertaken
without
consultation
the
collection
of
the
customs
of
the
do
minican
republic
through
the
general
receiver
of
customs
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
the
convention
of
february
has
proceeded
in
an
uneventful
and
satisfactory
manner
the
customs
receipts
have
decreased
owing
to
disturbed
political
and
economic
conditions
and
to
a
very
natural
curtailment
of
imports
in
view
of
the
anticipated
revision
of
the
dominican
tariff
schedule
the
payments
to
the
fiscal
agency
fund
for
the
service
of
the
bonded
debt
of
the
republic
as
provided
by
the
convention
have
been
regularly
and
promptly
made
and
satisfactory
progress
has
been
made
in
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
the
convention
looking
towards
the
completion
of
the
adjustment
of
the
debt
and
the
acquirement
by
the
dominican
government
of
certain
concessions
and
monopolies
which
have
been
a
burden
to
the
commerce
of
the
country
in
short
the
receivership
has
demonstrated
its
ability
even
under
unfavorable
economic
and
political
conditions
to
do
the
work
for
which
it
was
intended
this
government
was
obliged
to
intervene
diplomatically
to
bring
about
arbitration
or
settlement
of
the
claim
of
the
emery
company
against
nicaragua
which
it
had
long
before
been
agreed
should
be
arbitrated
a
settlement
of
this
troublesome
case
was
reached
by
the
signature
of
a
protocol
on
september
many
years
ago
diplomatic
intervention
became
necessary
to
the
protection
of
the
interests
in
the
american
claim
of
alsop
and
company
against
the
government
of
chile
the
government
of
chile
had
frequently
admitted
obligation
in
the
case
and
had
promised
this
government
to
settle
there
had
been
two
abortive
attempts
to
do
so
through
arbitral
commissions
which
failed
through
lack
of
jurisdiction
now
happily
as
the
result
of
the
recent
diplomatic
negotiations
the
governments
of
the
united
states
and
of
chile
actuated
by
the
sincere
desire
to
free
from
any
strain
those
cordial
and
friendly
relations
upon
which
both
set
such
store
have
agreed
by
a
protocol
to
submit
the
controversy
to
definitive
settlement
by
his
britannic
majesty
edward
vii
since
the
washington
conventions
of
were
communicated
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
a
consulting
and
advising
party
this
government
has
been
almost
continuously
called
upon
by
one
or
another
and
in
turn
by
all
the
five
central
american
republics
to
exert
itself
for
the
maintenance
of
the
conventions
nearly
every
complaint
has
been
against
the
zelaya
government
of
nicaragua
which
has
kept
central
america
in
constant
tension
or
turmoil
the
responses
made
to
the
representations
of
central
american
republics
as
due
from
the
united
states
on
account
of
its
relation
to
the
washington
conventions
have
been
at
all
times
conservative
and
have
avoided
so
far
as
possible
any
semblance
of
interference
although
it
is
very
apparent
that
the
considerations
of
geographic
proximity
to
the
canal
zone
and
of
the
very
substantial
american
interests
in
central
america
give
to
the
united
states
a
special
position
in
the
zone
of
these
republics
and
the
caribbean
sea
i
need
not
rehearse
here
the
patient
efforts
of
this
government
to
promote
peace
and
welfare
among
these
republics
efforts
which
are
fully
appreciated
by
the
majority
of
them
who
are
loyal
to
their
true
interests
it
would
be
no
less
unnecessary
to
rehearse
here
the
sad
tale
of
unspeakable
barbarities
and
oppression
alleged
to
have
been
committed
by
the
zelaya
government
recently
two
americans
were
put
to
death
by
order
of
president
zelaya
himself
they
were
reported
to
have
been
regularly
commissioned
officers
in
the
organized
forces
of
a
revolution
which
had
continued
many
weeks
and
was
in
control
of
about
half
of
the
republic
and
as
such
according
to
the
modern
enlightened
practice
of
civilized
nations
they
were
entitled
to
be
dealt
with
as
prisoners
of
war
at
the
date
when
this
message
is
printed
this
government
has
terminated
diplomatic
relations
with
the
zelaya
government
for
reasons
made
public
in
a
communication
to
the
former
nicaraguan
charge
daffaires
and
is
intending
to
take
such
future
steps
as
may
be
found
most
consistent
with
its
dignity
its
duty
to
american
interests
and
its
moral
obligations
to
central
america
and
to
civilization
it
may
later
be
necessary
for
me
to
bring
this
subject
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
in
a
special
message
the
international
bureau
of
american
republics
has
carried
on
an
important
and
increasing
work
during
the
last
year
in
the
exercise
of
its
peculiar
functions
as
an
international
agency
maintained
by
all
the
american
republics
for
the
development
of
panamerican
commerce
and
friendship
it
has
accomplished
a
great
practical
good
which
could
be
done
in
the
same
way
by
no
individual
department
or
bureau
of
one
government
and
is
therefore
deserving
of
your
liberal
support
the
fact
that
it
is
about
to
enter
a
new
building
erected
through
the
munificence
of
an
american
philanthropist
and
the
contributions
of
all
the
american
nations
where
both
its
efficiency
of
administration
and
expense
of
maintenance
will
naturally
be
much
augmented
further
entitles
it
to
special
consideration
the
far
east
in
the
far
east
this
government
preserves
unchanged
its
policy
of
supporting
the
principle
of
equality
of
opportunity
and
scrupulous
respect
for
the
integrity
of
the
chinese
empire
to
which
policy
are
pledged
the
interested
powers
of
both
east
and
west
by
the
treaty
of
china
has
undertaken
the
abolition
of
likin
with
a
moderate
and
proportionate
raising
of
the
customs
tariff
along
with
currency
reform
these
reforms
being
of
manifest
advantage
to
foreign
commerce
as
well
as
to
the
interests
of
china
this
government
is
endeavoring
to
facilitate
these
measures
and
the
needful
acquiescence
of
the
treaty
powers
when
it
appeared
that
chinese
likin
revenues
were
to
be
hypothecated
to
foreign
bankers
in
connection
with
a
great
railway
project
it
was
obvious
that
the
governments
whose
nationals
held
this
loan
would
have
a
certain
direct
interest
in
the
question
of
the
carrying
out
by
china
of
the
reforms
in
question
because
this
railroad
loan
represented
a
practical
and
real
application
of
the
open
door
policy
through
cooperation
with
china
by
interested
powers
as
well
as
because
of
its
relations
to
the
reforms
referred
to
above
the
administration
deemed
american
participation
to
be
of
great
national
interest
happily
when
it
was
as
a
matter
of
broad
policy
urgent
that
this
opportunity
should
not
be
lost
the
indispensable
instrumentality
presented
itself
when
a
group
of
american
bankers
of
international
reputation
and
great
resources
agreed
at
once
to
share
in
the
loan
upon
precisely
such
terms
as
this
government
should
approve
the
chief
of
those
terms
was
that
american
railway
material
should
be
upon
an
exact
equality
with
that
of
the
other
nationals
joining
in
the
loan
in
the
placing
of
orders
for
this
whole
railroad
system
after
months
of
negotiation
the
equal
participation
of
americans
seems
at
last
assured
it
is
gratifying
that
americans
will
thus
take
their
share
in
this
extension
of
these
great
highways
of
trade
and
to
believe
that
such
activities
will
give
a
real
impetus
to
our
commerce
and
will
prove
a
practical
corollary
to
our
historic
policy
in
the
far
east
the
imperial
chinese
government
in
pursuance
of
its
decision
to
devote
funds
from
the
portion
of
the
indemnity
remitted
by
the
united
states
to
the
sending
of
students
to
this
country
has
already
completed
arrangements
for
carrying
out
this
purpose
and
a
considerable
body
of
students
have
arrived
to
take
up
their
work
in
our
schools
and
universities
no
one
can
doubt
the
happy
effect
that
the
associations
formed
by
these
representative
young
men
will
have
when
they
return
to
take
up
their
work
in
the
progressive
development
of
their
country
the
results
of
the
opium
conference
held
at
shanghai
last
spring
at
the
invitation
of
the
united
states
have
been
laid
before
the
government
the
report
shows
that
china
is
making
remarkable
progress
and
admirable
efforts
toward
the
eradication
of
the
opium
evil
and
that
the
governments
concerned
have
not
allowed
their
commercial
interests
to
interfere
with
a
helpful
cooperation
in
this
reform
collateral
investigations
of
the
opium
question
in
this
country
lead
me
to
recommend
that
the
manufacture
sale
and
use
of
opium
and
its
derivatives
in
the
united
states
should
be
so
far
as
possible
more
rigorously
controlled
by
legislation
in
one
of
the
chinesejapanese
conventions
of
september
of
this
year
there
was
a
provision
which
caused
considerable
public
apprehension
in
that
upon
its
face
it
was
believed
in
some
quarters
to
seek
to
establish
a
monopoly
of
mining
privileges
along
the
south
manchurian
and
antungmukden
railroads
and
thus
to
exclude
americans
from
a
wide
field
of
enterprise
to
take
part
in
which
they
were
by
treaty
with
china
entitled
after
a
thorough
examination
of
the
conventions
and
of
the
several
contextual
documents
the
secretary
of
state
reached
the
conclusion
that
no
such
monopoly
was
intended
or
accomplished
however
in
view
of
the
widespread
discussion
of
this
question
to
confirm
the
view
it
had
reached
this
government
made
inquiry
of
the
imperial
chinese
and
japanese
governments
and
received
from
each
official
assurance
that
the
provision
had
no
purpose
inconsistent
with
the
policy
of
equality
of
opportunity
to
which
the
signatories
in
common
with
the
united
states
are
pledged
our
traditional
relations
with
the
japanese
empire
continue
cordial
as
usual
as
the
representative
of
japan
his
imperial
highness
prince
kuni
visited
the
hudsonfulton
celebration
the
recent
visit
of
a
delegation
of
prominent
business
men
as
guests
of
the
chambers
of
commerce
of
the
pacific
slope
whose
representatives
had
been
so
agreeably
received
in
japan
will
doubtless
contribute
to
the
growing
trade
across
the
pacific
as
well
as
to
that
mutual
understanding
which
leads
to
mutual
appreciation
the
arrangement
of
for
a
cooperative
control
of
the
coming
of
laborers
to
the
united
states
has
proved
to
work
satisfactorily
the
matter
of
a

revision
of
the
existing
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
japan
which
is
terminable
in
is
already
receiving
the
study
of
both
countries
the
department
of
state
is
considering
the
revision
in
whole
or
in
part
of
the
existing
treaty
with
siam
which
was
concluded
in
and
is
now
in
respect
to
many
of
its
provisions
out
of
date
the
department
of
state
i
earnestly
recommend
to
the
favorable
action
of
the
congress
the
estimates
submitted
by
the
department
of
state
and
most
especially
the
legislation
suggested
in
the
secretary
of
states
letter
of
this
date
whereby
it
will
be
possible
to
develop
and
make
permanent
the
reorganization
of
the
department
upon
modern
lines
in
a
manner
to
make
it
a
thoroughly
efficient
instrument
in
the
furtherance
of
our
foreign
trade
and
of
american
interests
abroad
the
plan
to
have
divisions
of
latinamerican
and
far
eastern
affairs
and
to
institute
a
certain
specialization
in
business
with
europe
and
the
near
east
will
at
once
commend
itself
these
politicogeographical
divisions
and
the
detail
from
the
diplomatic
or
consular
service
to
the
department
of
a
number
of
men
who
bring
to
the
study
of
complicated
problems
in
different
parts
of
the
world
practical
knowledge
recently
gained
on
the
spot
clearly
is
of
the
greatest
advantage
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
foreseeing
conditions
likely
to
arise
and
in
conducting
the
great
variety
of
correspondence
and
negotiation
it
should
be
remembered
that
such
facilities
exist
in
the
foreign
offices
of
all
the
leading
commercial
nations
and
that
to
deny
them
to
the
secretary
of
state
would
be
to
place
this
government
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
the
rivalry
of
commercial
competition
the
consular
service
has
been
greatly
improved
under
the
law
of
april
and
the
executive
order
of
june
and
i
commend
to
your
consideration
the
question
of
embodying
in
a
statute
the
principles
of
the
present
executive
order
upon
which
the
efficiency
of
our
consular
service
is
wholly
dependent
in
modern
times
political
and
commercial
interests
are
interrelated
and
in
the
negotiation
of
commercial
treaties
conventions
and
tariff
agreements
the
keeping
open
of
opportunities
and
the
proper
support
of
american
enterprises
our
diplomatic
service
is
quite
as
important
as
the
consular
service
to
the
business
interests
of
the
country
impressed
with
this
idea
and
convinced
that
selection
after
rigorous
examination
promotion
for
merit
solely
and
the
experience
only
to
be
gained
through
the
continuity
of
an
organized
service
are
indispensable
to
a
high
degree
of
efficiency
in
the
diplomatic
service
i
have
signed
an
executive
order
as
the
first
step
toward
this
very
desirable
result
its
effect
should
be
to
place
all
secretaries
in
the
diplomatic
service
in
much
the
same
position
as
consular
officers
are
now
placed
and
to
tend
to
the
promotion
of
the
most
efficient
to
the
grade
of
minister
generally
leaving
for
outside
appointments
such
posts
of
the
grade
of
ambassador
or
minister
as
it
may
be
expedient
to
fill
from
without
the
service
it
is
proposed
also
to
continue
the
practice
instituted
last
summer
of
giving
to
all
newly
appointed
secretaries
at
least
one
months
thorough
training
in
the
department
of
state
before
they
proceed
to
their
posts
this
has
been
done
for
some
time
in
regard
to
the
consular
service
with
excellent
results
under
a
provision
of
the
act
of
august
i
have
appointed
three
officials
to
assist
the
officers
of
the
government
in
collecting
information
necessary
to
a
wise
administration
of
the
tariff
act
of
august
as
to
questions
of
customs
administration
they
are
cooperating
with
the
officials
of
the
treasury
department
and
as
to
matters
of
the
needs
and
the
exigencies
of
our
manufacturers
and
exporters
with
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
in
its
relation
to
the
domestic
aspect
of
the
subject
of
foreign
commerce
in
the
study
of
foreign
tariff
treatment
they
will
assist
the
bureau
of
trade
relations
of
the
department
of
state
it
is
hoped
thus
to
coordinate
and
bring
to
bear
upon
this
most
important
subject
all
the
agencies
of
the
government
which
can
contribute
anything
to
its
efficient
handling
as
a
consequence
of
section
of
the
tariff
act
of
august
it
becomes
the
duty
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
conduct
as
diplomatic
business
all
the
negotiations
necessary
to
place
him
in
a
position
to
advise
me
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
country
unduly
discriminates
against
the
united
states
in
the
sense
of
the
statute
referred
to
the
great
scope
and
complexity
of
this
work
as
well
as
the
obligation
to
lend
all
proper
aid
to
our
expanding
commerce
is
met
by
the
expansion
of
the
bureau
of
trade
relations
as
set
forth
in
the
estimates
for
the
department
of
state
other
departments
i
have
thus
in
some
detail
described
the
important
transactions
of
the
state
department
since
the
beginning
of
this
administration
for
the
reason
that
there
is
no
provision
either
by
statute
or
custom
for
a
formal
report
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
the
president
or
to
congress
and
a
presidential
message
is
the
only
means
by
which
the
condition
of
our
foreign
relations
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
and
the
public
in
dealing
with
the
affairs
of
the
other
departments
the
heads
of
which
all
submit
annual
reports
i
shall
touch
only
those
matters
that
seem
to
me
to
call
for
special
mention
on
my
part
without
minimizing
in
any
way
the
recommendations
made
by
them
for
legislation
affecting
their
respective
departments
in
all
of
which
i
wish
to
express
my
general
concurrence
government
expenditures
and
revenues
perhaps
the
most
important
question
presented
to
this
administration
is
that
of
economy
in
expenditures
and
sufficiency
of
revenue
the
deficit
of
the
last
fiscal
year
and
the
certain
deficit
of
the
current
year
prompted
congress
to
throw
a
greater
responsibility
on
the
executive
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
than
had
heretofore
been
declared
by
statute
this
declaration
imposes
upon
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
duty
of
assembling
all
the
estimates
of
the
executive
departments
bureaus
and
offices
of
the
expenditures
necessary
in
the
ensuing
fiscal
year
and
of
making
an
estimate
of
the
revenues
of
the
government
for
the
same
period
and
if
a
probable
deficit
is
thus
shown
it
is
made
the
duty
of
the
president
to
recommend
the
method
by
which
such
deficit
can
be
met
the
report
of
the
secretary
shows
that
the
ordinary
expenditures
for
the
current
fiscal
year
ending
june
will
exceed
the
estimated
receipts
by
if
to
this
deficit
is
added
the
sum
to
be
disbursed
for
the
panama
canal
amounting
to
and
to
be
paid
on
the
public
debt
the
deficit
of
ordinary
receipts
and
expenditures
will
be
increased
to
a
total
deficit
of
this
deficit
the
secretary
proposes
to
meet
by
the
proceeds
of
bonds
issued
to
pay
the
cost
of
constructing
the
panama
canal
i
approve
this
proposal
the
policy
of
paying
for
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
not
out
of
current
revenue
but
by
bond
issues
was
adopted
in
the
spooner
act
of
and
there
seems
to
be
no
good
reason
for
departing
from
the
principle
by
which
a
part
at
least
of
the
burden
of
the
cost
of
the
canal
shall
fall
upon
our
posterity
who
are
to
enjoy
it
and
there
is
all
the
more
reason
for
this
view
because
the
actual
cost
to
date
of
the
canal
which
is
now
half
done
and
which
will
be
completed
january
shows
that
the
cost
of
engineering
and
construction
will
be
instead
of
as
originally
estimated
in
addition
to
engineering
and
construction
the
other
expenses
including
sanitation
and
government
and
the
amount
paid
for
the
properties
the
franchise
and
the
privilege
of
building
the
canal
increase
the
cost
by
to
a
total
of
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
engineering
and
construction
is
due
to
a
substantial
enlargement
of
the
plan
of
construction
by
widening
the
canal
feet
in
the
culebra
cut
and
by
increasing
the
dimensions
of
the
locks
to
the
underestimate
of
the
quantity
of
the
work
to
be
done
under
the
original
plan
and
to
an
underestimate
of
the
cost
of
labor
and
materials
both
of
which
have
greatly
enhanced
in
price
since
the
original
estimate
was
made
in
order
to
avoid
a
deficit
for
the
ensuing
fiscal
year
i
directed
the
heads
of
departments
in
the
preparation
of
their
estimates
to
make
them
as
low
as
possible
consistent
with
imperative
governmental
necessity
the
result
has
been
as
i
am
advised
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
the
estimates
for
the
expenses
of
the
government
for
the
next
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
less
than
the
appropriations
for
this
current
fiscal
year
by
so
far
as
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
able
to
form
a
judgment
as
to
future
income
and
compare
it
with
the
expenditures
for
the
next
fiscal
year
ending
june
and
excluding
payments
on
account
of
the
panama
canal
which
will
doubtless
be
taken
up
by
bonds
there
will
be
a
surplus
of
in
the
present
estimates
the
needs
of
the
departments
and
of
the
government
have
been
cut
to
the
quick
so
to
speak
and
any
assumption
on
the
part
of
congress
so
often
made
in
times
past
that
the
estimates
have
been
prepared
with
the
expectation
that
they
may
be
reduced
will
result
in
seriously
hampering
proper
administration
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
points
out
what
should
be
carefully
noted
in
respect
to
this
reduction
in
governmental
expenses
for
the
next
fiscal
year
that
the
economies
are
of
two
kindsfirst
there
is
a
saving
in
the
permanent
administration
of
the
departments
bureaus
and
offices
of
the
government
and
second
there
is
a
present
reduction
in
expenses
by
a
postponement
of
projects
and
improvements
that
ultimately
will
have
to
be
carried
out
but
which
are
now
delayed
with
the
hope
that
additional
revenue
in
the
future
will
permit
their
execution
without
producing
a
deficit
it
has
been
impossible
in
the
preparation
of
estimates
greatly
to
reduce
the
cost
of
permanent
administration
this
can
not
be
done
without
a
thorough
reorganization
of
bureaus
offices
and
departments
for
the
purpose
of
securing
information
which
may
enable
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
to
unite
in
a
plan
for
the

permanent
reduction
of
the
cost
of
governmental
administration
the
treasury
department
has
instituted
an
investigation
by
one
of
the
most
skilled
expert
accountants
in
the
united
states
the
result
of
his
work
in
two
or
three
bureaus
which
if
extended
to
the
entire
government
must
occupy
two
or
more
years
has
been
to
show
much
room
for
improvement
and
opportunity
for
substantial
reductions
in
the
cost
and
increased
efficiency
of
administration
the
object
of
the
investigation
is
to
devise
means
to
increase
the
average
efficiency
of
each
employee
there
is
great
room
for
improvement
toward
this
end
not
only
by
the
reorganization
of
bureaus
and
departments
and
in
the
avoidance
of
duplication
but
also
in
the
treatment
of
the
individual
employee
under
the
present
system
it
constantly
happens
that
two
employees
receive
the
same
salary
when
the
work
of
one
is
far
more
difficult
and
important
and
exacting
than
that
of
the
other
superior
ability
is
not
rewarded
or
encouraged
as
the
classification
is
now
entirely
by
salary
an
employee
often
rises
to
the
highest
class
while
doing
the
easiest
work
for
which
alone
he
may
be
fitted
an
investigation
ordered
by
my
predecessor
resulted
in
the
recommendation
that
the
civil
service
he
reclassified
according
to
the
kind
of
work
so
that
the
work
requiring
most
application
and
knowledge
and
ability
shall
receive
most
compensation
i
believe
such
a
change
would
be
fairer
to
the
whole
force
and
would
permanently
improve
the
personnel
of
the
service
more
than
this
every
reform
directed
toward
the
improvement
in
the
average
efficiency
of
government
employees
must
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
executive
to
eliminate
from
the
government
service
those
who
are
inefficient
from
any
cause
and
as
the
degree
of
efficiency
in
all
the
departments
is
much
lessened
by
the
retention
of
old
employees
who
have
outlived
their
energy
and
usefulness
it
is
indispensable
to
any
proper
system
of
economy
that
provision
be
made
so
that
their
separation
from
the
service
shall
be
easy
and
inevitable
it
is
impossible
to
make
such
provision
unless
there
is
adopted
a
plan
of
civil
pensions
most
of
the
great
industrial
organizations
and
many
of
the
wellconducted
railways
of
this
country
are
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
a
system
of
pensions
for
old
employees
and
the
substitution
therefor
of
younger
and
more
energetic
servants
promotes
both
economy
and
efficiency
of
administration
i
am
aware
that
there
is
a
strong
feeling
in
both
houses
of
congress
and
possibly
in
the
country
against
the
establishment
of
civil
pensions
and
that
this
has
naturally
grown
out
of
the
heavy
burden
of
military
pensions
which
it
has
always
been
the
policy
of
our
government
to
assume
but
i
am
strongly
convinced
that
no
other
practical
solution
of
the
difficulties
presented
by
the
superannuation
of
civil
servants
can
be
found
than
that
of
a
system
of
civil
pensions
the
business
and
expenditures
of
the
government
have
expanded
enormously
since
the
spanish
war
but
as
the
revenues
have
increased
in
nearly
the
same
proportion
as
the
expenditures
until
recently
the
attention
of
the
public
and
of
those
responsible
for
the
government
has
not
been
fastened
upon
the
question
of
reducing
the
cost
of
administration
we
can
not
in
view
of
the
advancing
prices
of
living
hope
to
save
money
by
a
reduction
in
the
standard
of
salaries
paid
indeed
if
any
change
is
made
in
that
regard
an
increase
rather
than
a
decrease
will
be
necessary
and
the
only
means
of
economy
will
be
in
reducing
the
number
of
employees
and
in
obtaining
a
greater
average
of
efficiency
from
those
retained
in
the
service
close
investigation
and
study
needed
to
make
definite
recommendations
in
this
regard
will
consume
at
least
two
years
i
note
with
much
satisfaction
the
organization
in
the
senate
of
a
committee
on
public
expenditures
charged
with
the
duty
of
conducting
such
an
investigation
and
i
tender
to
that
committee
all
the
assistance
which
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
can
possibly
render
frauds
in
the
collection
of
customs
i
regret
to
refer
to
the
fact
of
the
discovery
of
extensive
frauds
in
the
collections
of
the
customs
revenue
at
new
york
city
in
which
a
number
of
the
subordinate
employees
in
the
weighing
and
other
departments
were
directly
concerned
and
in
which
the
beneficiaries
were
the
american
sugar
refining
company
and
others
the
frauds
consisted
in
the
payment
of
duty
on
underweights
of
sugar
the
government
has
recovered
from
the
american
sugar
refining
company
all
that
it
is
shown
to
have
been
defrauded
of
the
sum
was
received
in
full
of
the
amount
due
which
might
have
been
recovered
by
civil
suit
against
the
beneficiary
of
the
fraud
but
there
was
an
express
reservation
in
the
contract
of
settlement
by
which
the
settlement
should
not
interfere
with
or
prevent
the
criminal
prosecution
of
everyone
who
was
found
to
be
subject
to
the
same
criminal
prosecutions
are
now
proceeding
against
a
number
of
the
government
officers
the
treasury
department
and
the
department
of
justice
are
exerting
every
effort
to
discover
all
the
wrongdoers
including
the
officers
and
employees
of
the
companies
who
may
have
been
privy
to
the
fraud
it
would
seem
to
me
that
an
investigation
of
the
frauds
by
congress
at
present
pending
the
probing
by
the
treasury
department
and
the
department
of
justice
as
proposed
might
by
giving
immunity
and
otherwise
prove
an
embarrassment
in
securing
conviction
of
the
guilty
parties
maximum
and
minimum
clause
in
tariff
act
two
features
of
the
new
tariff
act
call
for
special
reference
by
virtue
of
the
clause
known
as
the
maximum
and
minimum
clause
it
is
the
duty
of
the
executive
to
consider
the
laws
and
practices
of
other
countries
with
reference
to
the
importation
into
those
countries
of
the
products
and
merchandise
of
the
united
states
and
if
the
executive
finds
such
laws
and
practices
not
to
be
unduly
discriminatory
against
the
united
states
the
minimum
duties
provided
in
the
bill
are
to
go
into
force
unless
the
president
makes
such
a
finding
then
the
maximum
duties
provided
in
the
bill
that
is
an
increase
of
twentyfive
per
cent
ad
valorem
over
the
minimum
duties
are
to
be
in
force
fear
has
been
expressed
that
this
power
conferred
and
duty
imposed
on
the
executive
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
tariff
war
i
beg
to
express
the
hope
and
belief
that
no
such
result
need
be
anticipated
the
discretion
granted
to
the
executive
by
the
terms
unduly
discriminatory
is
wide
in
order
that
the
maximum
duty
shall
be
charged
against
the
imports
from
a
country
it
is
necessary
that
he
shall
find
on
the
part
of
that
country
not
only
discriminations
in
its
laws
or
the
practice
under
them
against
the
trade
of
the
united
states
but
that
the
discriminations
found
shall
be
undue
that
is
without
good
and
fair
reason
i
conceive
that
this
power
was
reposed
in
the
president
with
the
hope
that
the
maximum
duties
might
never
be
applied
in
any
case
but
that
the
power
to
apply
them
would
enable
the
president
and
the
state
department
through
friendly
negotiation
to
secure
the
elimination
from
the
laws
and
the
practice
under
them
of
any
foreign
country
of
that
which
is
unduly
discriminatory
no
one
is
seeking
a
tariff
war
or
a
condition
in
which
the
spirit
of
retaliation
shall
be
aroused
uses
of
the
new
tariff
board
the
new
tariff
law
enables
me
to
appoint
a
tariff
board
to
assist
me
in
connection
with
the
department
of
state
in
the
administration
of
the
minimum
and
maximum
clause
of
the
act
and
also
to
assist
officers
of
the
government
in
the
administration
of
the
entire
law
an
examination
of
the
law
and
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
facts
which
should
be
considered
in
discharging
the
functions
imposed
upon
the
executive
show
that
i
have
the
power
to
direct
the
tariff
board
to
make
a
comprehensive
glossary
and
encyclopedia
of
the
terms
used
and
articles
embraced
in
the
tariff
law
and
to
secure
information
as
to
the
cost
of
production
of
such
goods
in
this
country
and
the
cost
of
their
production
in
foreign
countries
i
have
therefore
appointed
a
tariff
board
consisting
of
three
members
and
have
directed
them
to
perform
all
the
duties
above
described
this
work
will
perhaps
take
two
or
three
years
and
i
ask
from
congress
a
continuing
annual
appropriation
equal
to
that
already
made
for
its
prosecution
i
believe
that
the
work
of
this
board
will
be
of
prime
utility
and
importance
whenever
congress
shall
deem
it
wise
again
to
readjust
the
customs
duties
if
the
facts
secured
by
the
tariff
board
are
of
such
a
character
as
to
show
generally
that
the
rates
of
duties
imposed
by
the
present
tariff
law
are
excessive
under
the
principles
of
protection
as
described
in
the
platform
of
the
successful
party
at
the
late
election
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
this
fact
and
to
the
necessity
for
action
predicated
thereon
nothing
however
halts
business
and
interferes
with
the
course
of
prosperity
so
much
as
the
threatened
revision
of
the
tariff
and
until
the
facts
are
at
hand
after
careful
and
deliberate
investigation
upon
which
such
revision
can
properly
be
undertaken
it
seems
to
me
unwise
to
attempt
it
the
amount
of
misinformation
that
creeps
into
arguments
pro
and
con
in
respect
to
tariff
rates
is
such
as
to
require
the
kind
of
investigation
that
i
have
directed
the
tariff
board
to
make
an
investigation
undertaken
by
it
wholly
without
respect
to
the
effect
which
the
facts
may
have
in
calling
for
a
readjustment
of
the
rates
of
duty
war
department
in
the
interest
of
immediate
economy
and
because
of
the
prospect
of
a
deficit
i
have
required
a
reduction
in
the
estimates
of
the
war
department
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
which
brings
the
total
estimates
down
to
an
amount
fortyfive
millions
less
than
the
corresponding
estimates
for
last
year
this
could
only
be
accomplished
by
cutting
off
new
projects
and
suspending
for
the
period
of
one
year
all
progress
in
military
matters
for
the
same
reason
i
have
directed
that
the
army
shall
not
be
recruited
up
to
its
present
authorized
strength
these
mea
sures
can
hardly
be
more
than
temporaryto
last
until
our
revenues
are
in
better
condition
and
until
the
whole
question
of
the
expediency
of
adopting
a
definite
military
policy
can
be
submitted
to
congress
for
i
am
sure
that
the
interests
of
the
military
establishment
are
seriously
in
need
of
careful
consideration
by
congress
the
laws
regulating
the
organization
of
our
armed
forces
in
the
event
of
war
need
to
be
revised
in
order
that
the
organization
can
be
modified
so
as
to
produce
a
force
which
would
be
more
consistently
apportioned
throughout
its
numerous
branches
to
explain
the
circumstances
upon
which
this
opinion
is
based
would
necessitate
a
lengthy
discussion
and
i
postpone
it
until
the
first
convenient
opportunity
shall
arise
to
send
to
congress
a
special
message
upon
this
subject
the
secretary
of
war
calls
attention
to
a
number
of
needed
changes
in
the
army
in
all
of
which
i
concur
but
the
point
upon
which
i
place
most
emphasis
is
the
need
for
an
elimination
bill
providing
a
method
by
which
the
merits
of
officers
shall
have
some
effect
upon
their
advancement
and
by
which
the
advancement
of
all
may
be
accelerated
by
the
effective
elimination
of
a
definite
proportion
of
the
least
efficient
there
are
in
every
army
and
certainly
in
ours
a
number
of
officers
who
do
not
violate
their
duty
in
any
such
way
as
to
give
reason
for
a
courtmartial
or
dismissal
but
who
do
not
show
such
aptitude
and
skill
and
character
for
high
command
as
to
justify
their
remaining
in
the
active
service
to
be
promoted
provision
should
be
made
by
which
they
may
be
retired
on
a
certain
proportion
of
their
pay
increasing
with
their
length
of
service
at
the
time
of
retirement
there
is
now
a
personnel
law
for
the
navy
which
itself
needs
amendment
and
to
which
i
shall
make
further
reference
such
a
law
is
needed
quite
as
much
for
the
army
the
coast
defenses
of
the
united
states
proper
are
generally
all
that
could
be
desired
and
in
some
respects
they
are
rather
more
elaborate
than
under
present
conditions
are
needed
to
stop
an
enemys
fleet
from
entering
the
harbors
defended
there
is
however
one
place
where
additional
defense
is
badly
needed
and
that
is
at
the
mouth
of
chesapeake
bay
where
it
is
proposed
to
make
an
artificial
island
for
a
fort
which
shall
prevent
an
enemys
fleet
from
entering
this
most
important
strategical
base
of
operations
on
the
whole
atlantic
and
gulf
coasts
i
hope
that
appropriate
legislation
will
be
adopted
to
secure
the
construction
of
this
defense
the
military
and
naval
joint
board
have
unanimously
agreed
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
make
the
large
expenditures
which
at
one
time
were
contemplated
in
the
establishment
of
a
naval
base
and
station
in
the
philippine
islands
and
have
expressed
their
judgment
in
which
i
fully
concur
in
favor
of
making
an
extensive
naval
base
at
pearl
harbor
near
honolulu
and
not
in
the
philippines
this
does
not
dispense
with
the
necessity
for
the
comparatively
small
appropriations
required
to
finish
the
proper
coast
defenses
in
the
philippines
now
under
construction
on
the
island
of
corregidor
and
elsewhere
or
to
complete
a
suitable
repair
station
and
coaling
supply
station
at
olongapo
where
is
the
floating
dock
dewey
i
hope
that
this
recommendation
of
the
joint
board
will
end
the
discussion
as
to
the
comparative
merits
of
manila
bay
and
olongapo
as
naval
stations
and
will
lead
to
prompt
measures
for
the
proper
equipment
and
defense
of
pearl
harbor
the
navy
the
return
of
the
battleship
fleet
from
its
voyage
around
the
world
in
more
efficient
condition
than
when
it
started
was
a
noteworthy
event
of
interest
alike
to
our
citizens
and
the
naval
authorities
of
the
world
besides
the
beneficial
and
farreaching
effect
on
our
personal
and
diplomatic
relations
in
the
countries
which
the
fleet
visited
the
marked
success
of
the
ships
in
steaming
around
the
world
in
all
weathers
on
schedule
time
has
increased
respect
for
our
navy
and
has
added
to
our
national
prestige
our
enlisted
personnel
recruited
from
all
sections
of
the
country
is
young
and
energetic
and
representative
of
the
national
spirit
it
is
moreover
owing
to
its
intelligence
capable
of
quick
training
into
the
modern
manofwarsman
our
officers
are
earnest
and
zealous
in
their
profession
but
it
is
a
regrettable
fact
that
the
higher
officers
are
old
for
the
responsibilities
of
the
modern
navy
and
the
admirals
do
not
arrive
at
flag
rank
young
enough
to
obtain
adequate
training
in
their
duties
as
flag
officers
this
need
for
reform
in
the
navy
has
been
ably
and
earnestly
presented
to
congress
by
my
predecessor
and
i
also
urgently
recommend
the
subject
for
consideration
early
in
the
coming
session
a
comprehensive
plan
for
the
reorganization
of
the
officers
of
all
corps
of
the
navy
will
be
presented
to
congress
and
i
hope
it
will
meet
with
action
suited
to
its
urgency
owing
to
the
necessity
for
economy
in
expenditures
i
have
directed
the
curtailment
of
recommendations
for
naval
appropriations
so
that
they
are
thirtyeight
millions
less
than
the
corresponding
estimates
of
last
year
and
the
request
for
new
naval
construction
is
limited
to
two
firstclass
battle
ships
and
one
repair
vessel
the
use
of
a
navy
is
for
military
purposes
and
there
has
been
found
need
in
the
department
of
a
military
branch
dealing
directly
with
the
military
use
of
the
fleet
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
also
felt
the
lack
of
responsible
advisers
to
aid
him
in
reaching
conclusions
and
deciding
important
matters
between
coordinate
branches
of
the
department
to
secure
these
results
he
has
inaugurated
a
tentative
plan
involving
certain
changes
in
the
organization
of
the
navy
department
including
the
navyyards
all
of
which
have
been
found
by
the
attorneygeneral
to
be
in
accordance
with
law
i
have
approved
the
execution
of
the
plan
proposed
because
of
the
greater
efficiency
and
economy
it
promises
the
generosity
of
congress
has
provided
in
the
present
naval
observatory
the
most
magnificent
and
expensive
astronomical
establishment
in
the
world
it
is
being
used
for
certain
naval
purposes
which
might
easily
and
adequately
be
subserved
by
a
small
division
connected
with
the
naval
department
at
only
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
the
present
naval
observatory
the
official
board
of
visitors
established
by
congress
and
appointed
in
expressed
its
conclusion
that
the
official
head
of
the
observatory
should
be
an
eminent
astronomer
appointed
by
the
president
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
holding
his
place
by
a
tenure
at
least
as
permanent
as
that
of
the
superintendent
of
the
coast
survey
or
the
head
of
the
geological
survey
and
not
merely
by
a
detail
of
two
or
three
years
duration
i
fully
concur
in
this
judgment
and
urge
a
provision
by
law
for
the
appointment
of
such
a
director
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
take
the
observatory
out
of
the
navy
department
and
put
it
into
another
department
in
which
opportunity
for
scientific
research
afforded
by
the
observatory
would
seem
to
be
more
appropriate
though
i
believe
such
a
transfer
in
the
long
run
is
the
best
policy
i
am
sure
however
i
express
the
desire
of
the
astronomers
and
those
learned
in
the
kindred
sciences
when
i
urge
upon
congress
that
the
naval
observatory
be
now
dedicated
to
science
under
control
of
a
man
of
science
who
can
if
need
be
render
all
the
service
to
the
navy
department
which
this
observatory
now
renders
and
still
furnish
to
the
world
the
discoveries
in
astronomy
that
a
great
astronomer
using
such
a
plant
would
be
likely
to
make
department
of
justice
expedition
in
legal
procedure
the
deplorable
delays
in
the
administration
of
civil
and
criminal
law
have
received
the
attention
of
committees
of
the
american
bar
association
and
of
many
state
bar
associations
as
well
as
the
considered
thought
of
judges
and
jurists
in
my
judgment
a
change
in
judicial
procedure
with
a
view
to
reducing
its
expense
to
private
litigants
in
civil
cases
and
facilitating
the
dispatch
of
business
and
final
decision
in
both
civil
and
criminal
cases
constitutes
the
greatest
need
in
our
american
institutions
i
do
not
doubt
for
one
moment
that
much
of
the
lawless
violence
and
cruelty
exhibited
in
lynchings
is
directly
due
to
the
uncertainties
and
injustice
growing
out
of
the
delays
in
trials
judgments
and
the
executions
thereof
by
our
courts
of
course
these
remarks
apply
quite
as
well
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
state
courts
as
to
that
in
federal
courts
and
without
making
invidious
distinction
it
is
perhaps
not
too
much
to
say
that
speaking
generally
the
defects
are
less
in
the
federal
courts
than
in
the
state
courts
but
they
are
very
great
in
the
federal
courts
the
expedition
with
which
business
is
disposed
of
both
on
the
civil
and
the
criminal
side
of
english
courts
under
modern
rules
of
procedure
makes
the
delays
in
our
courts
seem
archaic
and
barbarous
the
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
should
furnish
an
example
for
the
state
courts
i
presume
it
is
impossible
without
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
to
unite
under
one
form
of
action
the
proceedings
at
common
law
and
proceedings
in
equity
in
the
federal
courts
but
it
is
certainly
not
impossible
by
a
statute
to
simplify
and
make
short
and
direct
the
procedure
both
at
law
and
in
equity
in
those
courts
it
is
not
impossible
to
cut
down
still
more
than
it
is
cut
down
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
so
as
to
confine
it
almost
wholly
to
statutory
and
constitutional
questions
under
the
present
statutes
the
equity
and
admiralty
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
is
under
the
control
of
the
supreme
court
but
in
the
pressure
of
business
to
which
that
court
is
subjected
it
is
impossible
to
hope
that
a
radical
and
proper
reform
of
the
federal
equity
procedure
can
be
brought
about
i
therefore
recommend
legislation
providing
for
the
appointment
by
the
president
of
a
commission
with
authority
to
examine
the
law
and
equity
procedure
of
the
federal
courts
of
first
instance
the
law
of
appeals
from
those
courts
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
costs
imposed
in
such
procedure
upon

the
private
litigants
and
upon
the
public
treasury
and
make
recommendation
with
a
view
to
simplifying
and
expediting
the
procedure
as
far
as
possible
and
making
it
as
inexpensive
as
may
be
to
the
litigant
of
little
means
injunctions
without
notice
the
platform
of
the
successful
party
in
the
last
election
contained
the
following
the
republican
party
will
uphold
at
all
times
the
authority
and
integrity
of
the
courts
state
and
federal
and
will
ever
insist
that
their
powers
to
enforce
their
process
and
to
protect
life
liberty
and
property
shall
be
preserved
inviolate
we
believe
however
that
the
rules
of
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
injunction
should
be
more
accurately
defined
by
statute
and
that
no
injunction
or
temporary
restraining
order
should
be
issued
without
notice
except
where
irreparable
injury
would
result
from
delay
in
which
case
a
speedy
hearing
thereafter
should
be
granted
i
recommend
that
in
compliance
with
the
promise
thus
made
appropriate
legislation
be
adopted
the
ends
of
justice
will
best
be
met
and
the
chief
cause
of
complaint
against
illconsidered
injunctions
without
notice
will
be
removed
by
the
enactment
of
a
statute
forbidding
hereafter
the
issuing
of
any
injunction
or
restraining
order
whether
temporary
or
permanent
by
any
federal
court
without
previous
notice
and
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
behalf
of
the
parties
to
be
enjoined
unless
it
shall
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
the
delay
necessary
to
give
such
notice
and
hearing
would
result
in
irreparable
injury
to
the
complainant
and
unless
also
the
court
shall
from
the
evidence
make
a
written
finding
which
shall
be
spread
upon
the
court
minutes
that
immediate
and
irreparable
injury
is
likely
to
ensue
to
the
complainant
and
shall
define
the
injury
state
why
it
is
irreparable
and
shall
also
endorse
on
the
order
issued
the
date
and
the
hour
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
moreover
every
such
injunction
or
restraining
order
issued
without
previous
notice
and
opportunity
by
the
defendant
to
be
heard
should
by
force
of
the
statute
expire
and
be
of
no
effect
after
seven
days
from
the
issuance
thereof
or
within
any
time
less
than
that
period
which
the
court
may
fix
unless
within
such
seven
days
or
such
less
period
the
injunction
or
order
is
extended
or
renewed
after
previous
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
my
judgment
is
that
the
passage
of
such
an
act
which
really
embodies
the
best
practice
in
equity
and
is
very
like
the
rule
now
in
force
in
some
courts
will
prevent
the
issuing
of
illadvised
orders
of
injunction
without
notice
and
will
render
such
orders
when
issued
much
less
objectionable
by
the
short
time
in
which
they
may
remain
effective
antitrust
and
interstate
commerce
laws
the
jurisdiction
of
the
general
government
over
interstate
commerce
has
led
to
the
passage
of
the
socalled
sherman
antitrust
law
and
the
interstate
commerce
law
and
its
amendments
the
developments
in
the
operation
of
those
laws
as
shown
by
indictments
trials
judicial
decisions
and
other
sources
of
information
call
for
a
discussion
and
some
suggestions
as
to
amendments
these
i
prefer
to
embody
in
a
special
message
instead
of
including
them
in
the
present
communication
and
i
shall
avail
myself
of
the
first
convenient
opportunity
to
bring
these
subjects
to
the
attention
of
congress
jail
of
the
district
of
columbia
my
predecessor
transmitted
to
the
congress
a
special
message
on
january
accompanying
the
report
of
commissioners
theretofore
appointed
to
investigate
the
jail
workhouse
etc
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
he
directed
attention
to
the
report
as
setting
forth
vividly
the
really
outrageous
conditions
in
the
workhouse
and
jail
the
congress
has
taken
action
in
pursuance
of
the
recommendations
of
that
report
and
of
the
president
to
the
extent
of
appropriating
funds
and
enacting
the
necessary
legislation
for
the
establishment
of
a
workhouse
and
reformatory
no
action
however
has
been
taken
by
the
congress
with
respect
to
the
jail
the
conditions
of
which
are
still
antiquated
and
insanitary
i
earnestly
recommend
the
passage
of
a
sufficient
appropriation
to
enable
a
thorough
remodeling
of
that
institution
to
be
made
without
delay
it
is
a
reproach
to
the
national
government
that
almost
under
the
shadow
of
the
capitol
dome
prisoners
should
be
confined
in
a
building
destitute
of
the
ordinary
decent
appliances
requisite
to
cleanliness
and
sanitary
conditions
postoffice
department
secondclass
mail
matter
the
deficit
every
year
in
the
postoffice
department
is
largely
caused
by
the
low
rate
of
postage
of
cent
a
pound
charged
on
secondclass
mail
matter
which
includes
not
only
newspapers
but
magazines
and
miscellaneous
periodicals
the
actual
loss
growing
out
of
the
transmission
of
this
secondclass
mail
matter
at
cent
a
pound
amounts
to
about
a
year
the
average
cost
of
the
transportation
of
this
matter
is
more
than
cents
a
pound
it
appears
that
the
average
distance
over
which
newspapers
are
delivered
to
their
customers
is
miles
while
the
average
haul
of
magazines
is
and
of
miscellaneous
periodicals
miles
thus
the
average
haul
of
the
magazine
is
three
and
onehalf
times
and
that
of
the
miscellaneous
periodical
nearly
four
times
the
haul
of
the
daily
newspaper
yet
all
of
them
pay
the
same
postage
rate
of
cent
a
pound
the
statistics
of
show
that
secondclass
mail
matter
constituted
per
cent
of
the
weight
of
all
the
mail
and
yielded
only
per
cent
of
the
revenue
the
figures
given
are
startling
and
show
the
payment
by
the
government
of
an
enormous
subsidy
to
the
newspapers
magazines
and
periodicals
and
congress
may
well
consider
whether
radical
steps
should
not
be
taken
to
reduce
the
deficit
in
the
postoffice
department
caused
by
this
discrepancy
between
the
actual
cost
of
transportation
and
the
compensation
exacted
therefor
a
great
saving
might
be
made
amounting
to
much
more
than
half
of
the
loss
by
imposing
upon
magazines
and
periodicals
a
higher
rate
of
postage
they
are
much
heavier
than
newspapers
and
contain
a
much
higher
proportion
of
advertising
to
reading
matter
and
the
average
distance
of
their
transportation
is
three
and
a
half
times
as
great
the
total
deficit
for
the
last
fiscal
year
in
the
postoffice
department
amounted
to
the
branches
of
its
business
which
it
did
at
a
loss
were
the
secondclass
mail
service
in
which
the
loss
as
already
said
was
and
the
free
rural
delivery
in
which
the
loss
was
these
losses
were
in
part
offset
by
the
profits
of
the
letter
postage
and
other
sources
of
income
it
would
seem
wise
to
reduce
the
loss
upon
secondclass
mail
matter
at
least
to
the
extent
of
preventing
a
deficit
in
the
total
operations
of
the
postoffice
i
commend
the
whole
subject
to
congress
not
unmindful
of
the
spread
of
intelligence
which
a
low
charge
for
carrying
newspapers
and
periodicals
assists
i
very
much
doubt
however
the
wisdom
of
a
policy
which
constitutes
so
large
a
subsidy
and
requires
additional
taxation
to
meet
it
postal
savings
banks
the
second
subject
worthy
of
mention
in
the
postoffice
department
is
the
real
necessity
and
entire
practicability
of
establishing
postal
savings
banks
the
successful
party
at
the
last
election
declared
in
favor
of
postal
savings
banks
and
although
the
proposition
finds
opponents
in
many
parts
of
the
country
i
am
convinced
that
the
people
desire
such
banks
and
am
sure
that
when
the
banks
are
furnished
they
will
be
productive
of
the
utmost
good
the
postal
savings
banks
are
not
constituted
for
the
purpose
of
creating
competition
with
other
banks
the
rate
of
interest
upon
deposits
to
which
they
would
be
limited
would
be
so
small
as
to
prevent
their
drawing
deposits
away
from
other
banks
i
believe
them
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
offer
a
proper
inducement
to
thrift
and
saving
to
a
great
many
people
of
small
means
who
do
not
now
have
banking
facilities
and
to
whom
such
a
system
would
offer
an
opportunity
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
they
will
furnish
a
satisfactory
substitute
based
on
sound
principle
and
actual
successful
trial
in
nearly
all
the
countries
of
the
world
for
the
system
of
government
guaranty
of
deposits
now
being
adopted
in
several
western
states
which
with
deference
to
those
who
advocate
it
seems
to
me
to
have
in
it
the
seeds
of
demoralization
to
conservative
banking
and
certain
financial
disaster
the
question
of
how
the
money
deposited
in
postal
savings
banks
shall
be
invested
is
not
free
from
difficulty
but
i
believe
that
a
satisfactory
provision
for
this
purpose
was
inserted
as
an
amendment
to
the
bill
considered
by
the
senate
at
its
last
session
it
has
been
proposed
to
delay
the
consideration
of
legislation
establishing
a
postal
savings
bank
until
after
the
report
of
the
monetary
commission
this
report
is
likely
to
be
delayed
and
properly
so
cause
of
the
necessity
for
careful
deliberation
and
close
investigation
i
do
not
see
why
the
one
should
be
tied
up
with
the
other
it
is
understood
that
the
monetary
commission
have
looked
into
the
systems
of
banking
which
now
prevail
abroad
and
have
found
that
by
a
control
there
exercised
in
respect
to
reserves
and
the
rates
of
exchange
by
some
central
authority
panics
are
avoided
it
is
not
apparent
that
a
system
of
postal
savings
banks
would
in
any
way
interfere
with
a
change
to
such
a
system
here
certainly
in
most
of
the
countries
of
europe
where
control
is
thus
exercised
by
a
central
authority
postal
savings
banks
exist
and
are
not
thought
to
be
inconsistent
with
a
proper
financial
and
banking
system
ship
subsidy
following
the
course
of
my
distinguished
predecessor
i
earnestly
recommend
to
congress
the
consideration
and
passage
of
a
ship
subsidy
bill
looking
to
the
establishment
of
lines
between
our
atlantic
seaboard
and
the
eastern
coast
of
south
america
as
well
as
lines
from
the
west
coast
of
the
united
states
to
south
america
china
japan
and
the
philippines
the
profits
on
foreign
mails
are
perhaps
a
sufficient
measure
of
the
expenditures
which
might
first
be
tentatively
applied
to
this
method
of
inducing
america
n
capital
to
undertake
the
establishment
of
american
lines
of
steamships
in
those
directions
in
which
we
now
feel
it
most
important
that
we
should
have
means
of
transportation
controlled
in
the
interest
of
the
expansion
of
our
trade
a
bill
of
this
character
has
once
passed
the
house
and
more
than
once
passed
the
senate
and
i
hope
that
at
this
session
a
bill
framed
on
the
same
lines
and
with
the
same
purposes
may
become
a
law
interior
department
new
mexico
and
arizona
the
successful
party
in
the
last
election
in
its
national
platform
declared
in
favor
of
the
admission
as
separate
states
of
new
mexico
and
arizona
and
i
recommend
that
legislation
appropriate
to
this
end
be
adopted
i
urge
however
that
care
be
exercised
in
the
preparation
of
the
legislation
affecting
each
territory
to
secure
deliberation
in
the
selection
of
persons
as
members
of
the
convention
to
draft
a
constitution
for
the
incoming
state
and
i
earnestly
advise
that
such
constitution
after
adoption
by
the
convention
shall
be
submitted
to
the
people
of
the
territory
for
their
approval
at
an
election
in
which
the
sole
issue
shall
be
the
merits
of
the
proposed
constitution
and
if
the
constitution
is
defeated
by
popular
vote
means
shall
be
provided
in
the
enabling
act
for
a
new
convention
and
the
drafting
of
a
new
constitution
i
think
it
vital
that
the
issue
as
to
the
merits
of
the
constitution
should
not
be
mixed
up
with
the
selection
of
state
officers
and
that
no
election
of
state
officers
should
be
had
until
after
the
constitution
has
been
fully
approved
and
finally
settled
upon
alaska
with
respect
to
the
territory
of
alaska
i
recommend
legislation
which
shall
provide
for
the
appointment
by
the
president
of
a
governor
and
also
of
an
executive
council
the
members
of
which
shall
during
their
term
of
office
reside
in
the
territory
and
which
shall
have
legislative
powers
sufficient
to
enable
it
to
give
to
the
territory
local
laws
adapted
to
its
present
growth
i
strongly
deprecate
legislation
looking
to
the
election
of
a
territorial
legislature
in
that
vast
district
the
lack
of
permanence
of
residence
of
a
large
part
of
the
present
population
and
the
small
number
of
the
people
who
either
permanently
or
temporarily
reside
in
the
district
as
compared
with
its
vast
expanse
and
the
variety
of
the
interests
that
have
to
be
subserved
make
it
altogether
unfitting
in
my
judgment
to
provide
for
a
popular
election
of
a
legislative
body
the
present
system
is
not
adequate
and
does
not
furnish
the
character
of
local
control
that
ought
to
be
there
the
only
compromise
it
seems
to
me
which
may
give
needed
local
legislation
and
secure
a
conservative
government
is
the
one
i
propose
conservation
of
national
resources
in
several
departments
there
is
presented
the
necessity
for
legislation
looking
to
the
further
conservation
of
our
national
resources
and
the
subject
is
one
of
such
importance
as
to
require
a
more
detailed
and
extended
discussion
than
can
be
entered
upon
in
this
communication
for
that
reason
i
shall
take
an
early
opportunity
to
send
a
special
message
to
congress
on
the
subject
of
the
improvement
of
our
waterways
upon
the
reclamation
and
irrigation
of
arid
semiarid
and
swamp
lands
upon
the
preservation
of
our
forests
and
the
reforesting
of
suitable
areas
upon
the
reclassification
of
the
public
domain
with
a
view
of
separating
from

to

on

department

i
commend
to
your
careful
consideration
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
showing
the
immense
sphere
of
usefulness
which
that
department
now
fills
and
the
wonderful
addition

the
wealth
of

made
by

board
the
lighthouse
board
now
discharges
its
duties
under
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
for
upwards
of
forty
years
this
board
has
been
constituted
of
military
and
naval
officers
and
two
or
three
men
of
science
with
such
an
absence
of
a
duly
constituted
executive
head
that
it
is
marvelous
what
work
has
been
accomplished
in
the
period
of
construction
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
of
all
the
members
prevented
the
inherent
defects
of
the
system
from
interfering
greatly
with
the
beneficial
work
of
the
board
but
now
that
the
work
is
chiefly
confined
to
maintenance
and
repair
for
which
purpose
the
country
is
divided
into
sixteen
districts
to
which
are
assigned
an
engineer
officer
of
the
army
and
an
inspector
of
the
navy
each
with
a
lighthouse
tender
and
the
needed
plant
for
his
work
it
has
become
apparent
by
the
frequent
friction
that
arises
due
to
the
absence
of
any
central
independent
authority
that
there
must
be
a
complete
reorganization
of
the
board
i
concede
the
advantage
of
keeping
in
the
system
the
rigidity
of
discipline
that
the
presence
of
naval
and
military
officers
in
charge
insures
but
unless
the
presence
of
such
officers
in
the
board
can
be
made
consistent
with
a
responsible
executive
head
that
shall
have
proper
authority
i
recommend
the
transfer
of
control
over
the
lighthouses
to
a
suitable
civilian
bureau
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
judgment
of
competent
persons
who
are
familiar
with
the
workings
of
the
present
system
i
am
confident
that
a
reorganization
can
be
effected
which
shall
avoid
the
recurrence
of
friction
between
members
instances
of
which
have
been
officially
brought
to
my
attention
and
that
by
such
reorganization
greater
efficiency
and
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
expense
of
operation
can
be
brought
about
consolidation
of
bureaus
i
request
congressional
authority
to
enable
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
to
unite
the
bureaus
of
manufactures
and
statistics
this
was
recommended
by
a
competent
committee
appointed
in
the
previous
administration
for
the
purpose
of
suggesting
changes
in
the
interest
of
economy
and
efficiency
and
is
requested
by
the
secretary
the
white
slave
trade
i
greatly
regret
to
have
to
say
that
the
investigations
made
in
the
bureau
of
immigration
and
other
sources
of
information
lead
to
the
view
that
there
is
urgent
necessity
for
additional
legislation
and
greater
executive
activity
to
suppress
the
recruiting
of
the
ranks
of
prostitutes
from
the
streams
of
immigration
into
this
countryan
evil
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
has
been
called
the
white
slave
trade
i
believe
it
to
be
constitutional
to
forbid
under
penalty
the
transportation
of
persons
for
purposes
of
prostitution
across
national
and
state
lines
and
by
appropriating
a
fund
of
to
be
used
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
for
the
employment
of
special
inspectors
it
will
be
possible
to
bring
those
responsible
for
this
trade
to
indictment
and
conviction
under
a
federal
law
bureau
of
health
for
a
very
considerable
period
a
movement
has
been
gathering
strength
especially
among
the
members
of
the
medical
profession
in
favor
of
a
concentration
of
the
instruments
of
the
national
government
which
have
to
do
with
the
promotion
of
public
health
in
the
nature
of
things
the
medical
department
of
the
army
and
the
medical
department
of
the
navy
must
be
kept
separate
but
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
all
the
other
bureaus
and
offices
in
the
general
government
which
have
to
do
with
the
public
health
or
subjects
akin
thereto
should
not
be
united
in
a
bureau
to
be
called
the
bureau
of
public
health
this
would
necessitate
the
transfer
of
the
marinehospital
service
to
such
a
bureau
i
am
aware
that
there
is
wide
field
in
respect
to
the
public
health
committed
to
the
states
in
which
the
federal
government
can
not
exercise
jurisdiction
but
we
have
seen
in
the
agricultural
department
the
expansion
into
widest
usefulness
of
a
department
giving
attention
to
agriculture
when
that
subject
is
plainly
one
over
which
the
states
properly
exercise
direct
jurisdiction
the
opportunities
offered
for
useful
research
and
the
spread
of
useful
information
in
regard
to
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
and
the
breeding
of
stock
and
the
solution
of
many
of
the
intricate
problems
in
progressive
agriculture
have
demonstrated
the
wisdom
of
establishing
that
department
similar
reasons
of

civil

commission
the
work
of
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
has
been
performed
to
the
general
satisfaction
of
the
executive
officers
with
whom
the
commission
has
been
brought
into
official
communication
the
volume
of
that
work
and
its
variety
and
extent
have
under
new
laws
such
as
the
census
act
and
new
executive
orders
greatly
increased
the
activities
of
the
commission
required
by
the
statutes
have
reached
to
every
portion
of
the
public
domain
the
accommodations
of
the
commission
are
most
inadequate
for
its
needs
i
call
your
attention
to
its
request
for
increase
in
those
accommodations
as
will
appear
from
the
annual
report
for
this
year
political
contributions
i
urgently
recommend
to
congress
that
a
law
be
passed
requiring
that
candidates
in
elections
of
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
committees
in
charge
of
their
candidacy
and
campaign
file
in
a
proper
office
of
the
united
states
government
a
statement
of
the
contributions
received
and
of
the
expenditures
incurred
in
the
campaign
for
such
elections
and
that
similar
legislation
be
enacted
in
respect
to
all
other
elections
which
are
constitutionally
within
the
control
of
congress
freedmans
savings
and
trust
company
recommendations
have
been
made
by
my
predecessors
that
congress
appropriate
a
sufficient
sum
to
pay
the
balanceabout
per
centof
the
amounts
due
dep
ositors
in
the
freedmans
savings
and
trust
company
i
renew
this
recommendation
and
advise
also
that
a
proper
limitation
be
prescribed
fixing
a
period
within
which
the
claims
may
be
presented
that
assigned
claims
be
not
recognized
and
that
a
limit
be
imposed
on
the
amount
of
fees
collectible
for

in

such
claims
semicentennial
of
negro
freedom
the
year
will
mark
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
issuance
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
granting
freedom
to
the
negroes
it
seems
fitting
that
this
event
should
be
properly
celebrated
already
a
movement
has
been
started
by
prominent
negroes
encouraged
by
prominent
white
people
and
the
press
the
south
especially
is
manifesting
its
interest
in
this
movement
it
is
suggested
that
a
proper
form
of
celebration
would
be
an
exposition
to
show
the
progress
the
negroes
have
made
not
only
during
their
period
of
freedom
but
also
from
the
time
of
their
coming
to
this
country
i
heartily
indorse
this
proposal
and
request
that
the
executive
be
authorized
to
appoint
a
preliminary
commission
of
not
more
than
seven
persons
to
consider
carefully
whether
or
not
it
is
wise
to
hold
such
an
exposition
and
if
so
to
outline
a
plan
for
the
enterprise
i
further
recommend
that
such
preliminary
commission
serve
without
salary
except
as
to
their
actual
expenses
and
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
meet
such
expenses
conclusion
i
have
thus
in
a
message
compressed
as
much
as
the
subjects
will
permit
referred
to
many
of
the
legislative
needs
of
the
country
with
the
exceptions
already
noted
speaking
generally
the
country
is
in
a
high
state
of
prosperity
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
are
on
the
eve
of
a
substantial
business
expansion
and
we
have
just
garnered
a
harvest
unexampled
in
the
market
value
of
our
agricultural
products
the
high
prices
which
such
products
bring
mean
great
prosperity
for
the
farming
community
but
on
the
other
hand
they
mean
a
very
considerably
increased
burden
upon
those
classes
in
the
community
whose
yearly
compensation
does
not
expand
with
the
improvement
in
business
and
the
general
prosperity
various
reasons
are
given
for
the
high
prices
the
proportionate
increase
in
the
output
of
gold
which
today
is
the
chief
medium
of
exchange
and
is
in
some
respects
a
measure
of
value
furnishes
a
substantial
explanation
of
at
least
a
part
of
the
increase
in
prices
the
increase
in
population
and
the
more
expensive
mode
of
living
of
the
people
which
have
not
been
accompanied
by
a
proportionate
increase
in
acreage
production
may
furnish
a
further
reason
it
is
well
to
note
that
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
living
is
not
confined
to
this
country
but
prevails
the
world
over
and
that
those
who
would
charge
increases
in
prices
to
the
existing
protective
tariff
must
meet
the
fact
that
the
rise
in
prices
has
taken
place
almost
wholly
in
those
products
of
the
factory
and
farm
in
respect
to
which
there
has
been
either
no
increase
in
the
tariff
or
in
many
instances
a
very
considerable
reduction

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
finances
the
financial
standing
of
the
nation
at
the
present
time
is
excellent
and
the
financial
management
of
the
nations
interests
by
the
government
during
the
last
seven
years
has
shown
the
most
satisfactory
results
but
our
currency
system
is
imperfect
and
it
is
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
the
currency
commission
will
be
able
to
propose
a
thoroughly
good
system
which
will
do
away
with
the
existing
defects
during
the
period
from
july
to
september
there
was
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
money
in
circulation
of
the
increase
in
the
per
capita
during
this
period
was
within
this
time
there
were
several
occasions
when
it
was
necessary
for
the
treasury
department
to
come
to
the
relief
of
the
money
market
by
purchases
or
redemptions
of
united
states
bonds
by
increasing
deposits
in
national
banks
by
stimulating
additional
issues
of
national
bank
notes
and
by
facilitating
importations
from
abroad
of
gold
our
imperfect
currency
system
has
made
these
proceedings
necessary
and
they
were
effective
until
the
monetary
disturbance
in
the
fall
of
immensely
increased
the
difficulty
of
ordinary
methods
of
relief
by
the
middle
of
november
the
available
working
balance
in
the
treasury
had
been
reduced
to
approximately
clearing
house
associations
throughout
the
country
had
been
obliged
to
resort
to
the
expedient
of
issuing
clearing
house
certificates
to
be
used
as
money
in
this
emergency
it
was
determined
to
invite
subscriptions
for
panama
canal
bonds
and
three
per
cent
certificates
of
indebtedness
authorized
by
the
act
of
june
it
was
proposed
to
redeposit
in
the
national
banks
the
proceeds
of
these
issues
and
to
permit
their
use
as
a
basis
for
additional
circulating
notes
of
national
banks
the
moral
effect
of
this
procedure
was
so
great
that
it
was
necessary
to
issue
only
of
the
panama
canal
bonds
and
of
the
certificates
of
indebtedness
during
the
period
from
july
to
september
the
balance
between
the
net
ordinary
receipts
and
the
net
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
showed
a
surplus
in
the
four
years
and
and
a
deficit
in
the
years
and
a
fractional
part
of
the
fiscal
year
the
net
result
was
a
surplus
of
the
financial
operations
of
the
government
during
this
period
based
upon
these
differences
between
receipts
and
expenditures
resulted
in
a
net
reduction
of
the
interestbearing
debt
of
the
united
states
from
to
notwithstanding
that
there
had
been
two
sales
of
panama
canal
bonds
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
and
an
issue
of
three
per
cent
certificates
of
indebtedness
under
the
act
of
june
amounting
to
refunding
operations
of
the
treasury
department
under
the
act
of
march
resulted
in
the
conversion
into
two
per
cent
consols
of
of
bonds
bearing
higher
rates
of
interest
a
decrease
of
in
the
annual
interest
charge
resulted
from
these
operations
in
short
during
the
seven
years
and
three
months
there
has
been
a
net
surplus
of
nearly
one
hundred
millions
of
receipts
over
expenditures
a
reduction
of
the
interestbearing
debt
by
ninety
millions
in
spite
of
the
extraordinary
expense
of
the
panama
canal
and
a
saving
of
nearly
nine
millions
on
the
annual
interest
charge
this
is
an
exceedingly
satisfactory
showing
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
during
this
period
the
nation
has
never
hesitated
to
undertake
any
expenditure
that
it
regarded
as
necessary
there
have
been
no
new
taxes
and
no
increase
of
taxes
on
the
contrary
some
taxes
have
been
taken
off
there
has
been
a
reduction
of
taxation
corporations
as
regards
the
great
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
business
and
especially
the
railroad
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
already
again
and
again
said
in
my
messages
to
the
congress
i
believe
that
under
the
interstate
clause
of
the
constitution
the
united
states
has
complete
and
paramount
right
to
control
all
agencies
of
interstate
commerce
and
i
believe
that
the
national
government
alone
can
exercise
this
right
with
wisdom
and
effectiveness
so
as
both
to
secure
justice
from
and
to
do
justice
to
the
great
corporations
which
are
the
most
important
factors
in
modern
business
i
believe
that
it
is
worse
than
folly
to
attempt
to
prohibit
all
combinations
as
is
done
by
the
sherman
antitrust
law
because
such
a
law
can
be
enforced
only
imperfectly
and
unequally
and
its
enforcement
works
almost
as
much
hardship
as
good
i
strongly
advocate
that
instead
of
an
unwise
effort
to
prohibit
all
combinations
there
shall
be
substituted
a
law
which
shall
expressly
permit
combinations
which
are
in
the
interest
of
the
public
but
shall
at
the
same
time
give
to
some
agency
of
the
national
government
full
power
of
control
and
supervision
over
them
one
of
the
chief
features
of
this
control
should
be
securing
entire
publicity
in
all
matters
which
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
and
furthermore
the
power
not
by
judicial
but
by
executive
action
to
prevent
or
put
a
stop
to
every
form
of
improper
favoritism
or
other
wrongdoing
the
railways
of
the
country
should
be
put
completely
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
removed
from
the
domain
of
the
antitrust
law
the
power
of
the
commission
should
be
made
thoroughgoing
so
that
it
could
exercise
complete
supervision
and
control
over
the
issue
of
securities
as
well
as
over
the
raising
and
lowering
of
rates
as
regards
rates
at
least
this
power
should
be
summary
the
power
to
investigate
the
financial
operations
and
accounts
of
the
railways
has
been
one
of
the
most
valuable
features
in
recent
legislation
power
to
make
combinations
and
traffic
agreements
should
be
explicitly
conferred
upon
the
railroads
the
permission
of
the
commission
being
first
gained
and
the
combination
or
agreement
being
published
in
all
its
details
in
the
interest
of
the
public
the
representatives
of
the
public
should
have
complete
power
to
see
that
the
railroads
do
their
duty
by
the
public
and
as
a
matter
of
course
this
power
should
also
be
exercised
so
as
to
see
that
no
injustice
is
done
to
the
railroads
the
shareholders
the
employees
and
the
shippers
all
have
interests
that
must
be
guarded
it
is
to
the
interest
of
all
of
them
that
no
swindling
stock
speculation
should
be
allowed
and
that
there
should
be
no
improper
issuance
of
securities
the
guiding
intelligences
necessary
for
the
successful
building
and
successful
management
of
railroads
should
receive
ample
remuneration
but
no
man
should
be
allowed
to
make
money
in
connection
with
railroads
out
of
fraudulent
overcapitalization
and
kindred
stockgambling
performances
there
must
be
no
defrauding
of
investors
oppression
of
the
farmers
and
business
men
who
ship
freight
or
callous
disregard
of
the
rights
and
needs
of
the
employees
in
addition
to
this
the
interests
of
the
shareholders
of
the
employees
and
of
the
shippers
should
all
be
guarded
as
against
one
another
to
give
any
one
of
them
undue
and
improper
consideration
is
to
do
injustice
to
the
others
rates
must
be
made
as
low
as
is
compatible
with
giving
proper
returns
to
all
the
employees
of
the
railroad
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
and
proper
returns
to
the
shareholders
but
they
must
not
for
instance
be
reduced
in
such
fashion
as
to
necessitate
a
cut
in
the
wages
of
the
employees
or
the
abolition
of
the
proper
and
legitimate
profits
of
honest
shareholders
telegraph
and
telephone
companies
engaged
in
interstate
business
should
be
put
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
it
is
very
earnestly
to
be
wished
that
our
people
through
their
representatives
should
act
in
this
matter
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
most
damage
to
the
country
at
large
would
come
from
entire
failure
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
supervise
and
control
the
actions
of
the
great
corporations
or
from
the
exercise
of
the
necessary
governmental
power
in
a
way
which
would
do
injustice
and
wrong
to
the
corporations
both
the
preachers
of
an
unrestricted
individualism
and
the
preachers
of
an
oppression
which
would
deny
to
able
men
of
business
the
just
reward
of
their
initiative
and
business
sagacity
are
advocating
policies
that
would
be
fraught
with
the
gravest
harm
to
the
whole
country
to
permit
every
lawless
capitalist
every
lawdefying
corporation
to
take
any
action
no
matter
how
iniquitous
in
the
effort
to
secure
an
improper
profit
and
to
build
up
privilege
would
be
ruinous
to
the
republic
and
would
mark
the
abandonment
of
the
effort
to
secure
in
the
industrial
world
the
spirit
of
democratic
fair
dealing
on
the
other
hand
to
attack
these
wrongs
in
that
spirit
of
demagogy
which
can
see
wrong
only
when
committed
by
the
man
of
wealth
and
is
dumb
and
blind
in
the
presence
of
wrong
committed
against
men
of
property
or
by
men
of
no
property
is
exactly
as
evil
as
corruptly
to
defend
the
wrongdoing
of
men
of
wealth
the
war
we
wage
must
be
waged
against
misconduct
against
wrongdoing
wherever
it
is
found
and
we
must
stand
heartily
for
the
rights
of
every
decent
man
whether
he
be
a
man
of
great
wealth
or
a
man
who
earns
his
livelihood
as
a
wageworker
or
a
tiller
of
the
soil
it
is
to
the
interest
of
all
of
us
that
there
should
be
a
premium
put
upon
individual
initiative
and
individual
capacity
and
an
ample
reward
for
the
great
directing
intelligences
alone
competent
to
manage
the
great
business
operations
of
today
it
is
well
to
keep
in
mind
that
exactly
as
the
anarchist
is
the
worst
enemy
of
liberty
and
the
reactionary
the
worst
enemy
of
order
so
the
men
who
defend
the
rights
of
property
have
most
to
fear
from
the
wrongdoers
of
great
wealth
and
the
men
who
are
championing
popular
rights
have
most
to
fear
from
the
demagogues
who
in
the
name
of
popular
rights
would
do
wrong
to
and
oppress
honest
business
men
honest
men
of
wealth
for
the
success
of
either
type
of
wrongdoer
necessarily
invites
a
violent
reaction
against
the
cause
the
wrongdoer
nominally
upholds
in
point
of
danger
to
the
nation
there
is
nothing
to
choose
between
on
the
one
hand
the
corruptionist
the
bribegiver
the
bribetaker
the
man
who
employs
his
great
talent
to
swindle
his
fellowcitizens
on
a
large
scale
and
on
the
other
hand
the
preacher
of
class
hatred
the
man
who
whethe
r
from
ignorance
or
from
willingness
to
sacrifice
his
country
to
his
ambition
persuades
wellmeaning
but
wrongheaded
men
to
try
to
destroy
the
instruments
upon
which
our
prosperity
mainly
rests
let
each
group
of
men
beware
of
and
guard
against
the
shortcomings
to
which
that
group
is
itself
most
liable
too
often
we
see
the
business
community
in
a
spirit
of
unhealthy
class
consciousness
deplore
the
effort
to
hold
to
account
under
the
law
the
wealthy
men
who
in
their
management
of
great
corporations
whether
railroads
street
railways
or
other
industrial
enterprises
have
behaved
in
a
way
that
revolts
the
conscience
of
the
plain
decent
people
such
an
attitude
can
not
be
condemned
too
severely
for
men
of
property
should
recognize
that
they
jeopardize
the
rights
of
property
when
they
fail
heartily
to
join
in
the
effort
to
do
away
with
the
abuses
of
wealth
on
the
other
hand
those
who
advocate
proper
control
on
behalf
of
the
public
through
the
state
of
these
great
corporations
and
of
the
wealth
engaged
on
a
giant
scale
in
business
operations
must
ever
keep
in
mind
that
unless
they
do
scrupulous
justice
to
the
corporation
unless
they
permit
ample
profit
and
cordially
encourage
capable
men
of
business
so
long
as
they
act
with
honesty
they
are
striking
at
the
root
of
our
national
wellbeing
for
in
the
long
run
under
the
mere
pressure
of
material
distress
the
people
as
a
whole
would
probably
go
back
to
the
reign
of
an
unrestricted
individualism
rather
than
submit
to
a
control
by
the
state
so
drastic
and
so
foolish
conceived
in
a
spirit
of
such
unreasonable
and
narrow
hostility
to
wealth
as
to
prevent
business
operations
from
being
profitable
and
therefore
to
bring
ruin
upon
the
entire
business
community
and
ultimately
upon
the
entire
body
of
citizens
the
opposition
to
government
control
of
these
great
corporations
makes
its
most
effective
effort
in
the
shape
of
an
appeal
to
the
old
doctrine
of
states
rights
of
course
there
are
many
sincere
men
who
now
believe
in
unrestricted
individualism
in
business
just
as
there
were
formerly
many
sincere
men
who
believed
in
slaverythat
is
in
the
unrestricted
right
of
an
individual
to
own
another
individual
these
men
do
not
by
themselves
have
great
weight
however
the
effective
fight
against
adequate
government
control
and
supervision
of
individual
and
especially
of
corporate
wealth
engaged
in
interstate
business
is
chiefly
done
under
cover
and
especially
under
cover
of
an
appeal
to
states
rights
it
is
not
at
all
infrequent
to
read
in
the
same
speech
a
denunciation
of
predatory
wealth
fostered
by
special
privilege
and
defiant
of
both
the
public
welfare
and
law
of
the
land
and
a
denunciation
of
centralization
in
the
central
government
of
the
power
to
deal
with
this
centralized
and
organized
wealth
of
course
the
policy
set
forth
in
such
twin
denunciations
amounts
to
absolutely
nothing
for
the
first
half
is
nullified
by
the
second
half
the
chief
reason
among
the
many
sound
and
compelling
reasons
that
led
to
the
formation
of
the
national
government
was
the
absolute
need
that
the
union
and
not
the
several
states
should
deal
with
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
the
power
to
deal
with
interstate
commerce
was
granted
absolutely
and
plenarily
to
the
central
government
and
was
exercised
completely
as
regards
the
only
instruments
of
interstate
commerce
known
in
those
daysthe
waterways
the
highroads
as
well
as
the
partnerships
of
individuals
who
then
conducted
all
of
what
business
there
was
interstate
commerce
is
now
chiefly
conducted
by
railroads
and
the
great
corporation
has
supplanted
the
mass
of
small
partnerships
or
individuals
the
proposal
to
make
the
national
government
supreme
over
and
therefore
to
give
it
complete
control
over
the
railroads
and
other
instruments
of
interstate
commerce
is
merely
a
proposal
to
carry
out
to
the
letter
one
of
the
prime
purposes
if
not
the
prime
purpose
for
which
the
constitution
was
rounded
it
does
not
represent
centralization
it
represents
merely
the
acknowledgment
of
the
patent
fact
that
centralization
has
already
come
in
business
if
this
irresponsible
outside
business
power
is
to
be
controlled
in
the
interest
of
the
general
public
it
can
only
be
controlled
in
one
wayby
giving
adequate
power
of
control
to
the
one
sovereignty
capable
of
exercising
such
powerthe
national
government
forty
or
fifty
separate
state
governments
can
not
exercise
that
power
over
corporations
doing
business
in
most
or
all
of
them
first
because
they
absolutely
lack
the
authority
to
deal
with
interstate
business
in
any
form
and
second
because
of
the
inevitable
conflict
of
authority
sure
to
arise
in
the
effort
to
enforce
different
kinds
of
state
regulation
often
inconsistent
with
one
another
and
sometimes
oppressive
in
themselves
such
divided
authority
can
not
regulate
commerce
with
wisdom
and
effect
the
central
government
is
the
only
power
which
without
oppression
can
nevertheless
thoroughly
and
adequately
control
and
supervise
the
large
corporations
to
abandon
the
effort
for
national
control
means
to
abandon
the
effort
for
all
adequate
control
and
yet
to
render
likely
continual
bursts
of
action
by
state
legislatures
which
can
not
achieve
the
purpose
sought
for
but
which
can
do
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
the
corporation
without
conferring
any
real
benefit
on
the
public
i
believe
that
the
more
farsighted
corporations
are
themselves
coming
to
recognize
the
unwisdom
of
the
violent
hostility
they
have
displayed
during
the
last
few
years
to
regulation
and
control
by
the
national
government
of
combinations
engaged
in
interstate
business
the
truth
is
that
we
who
believe
in
this
movement
of
asserting
and
exercising
a
genuine
control
in
the
public
interest
over
these
great
corporations
have
to
contend
against
two
sets
of
enemies
who
though
nominally
opposed
to
one
another
are
really
allies
in
preventing
a
proper
solution
of
the
problem
there
are
first
the
big
corporation
men
and
the
extreme
individualists
among
business
men
who
genuinely
believe
in
utterly
unregulated
business
that
is
in
the
reign
of
plutocracy
and
second
the
men
who
being
blind
to
the
economic
movements
of
the
day
believe
in
a
movement
of
repression
rather
than
of
regulation
of
corporations
and
who
denounce
both
the
power
of
the
railroads
and
the
exercise
of
the
federal
power
which
alone
can
really
control
the
railroads
those
who
believe
in
efficient
national
control
on
the
other
hand
do
not
in
the
least
object
to
combinations
do
not
in
the
least
object
to
concentration
in
business
administration
on
the
contrary
they
favor
both
with
the
all
important
proviso
that
there
shall
be
such
publicity
about
their
workings
and
such
thoroughgoing
control
over
them
as
to
insure
their
being
in
the
interest
and
not
against
the
interest
of
the
general
public
we
do
not
object
to
the
concentration
of
wealth
and
administration
but
we
do
believe
in
the
distribution
of
the
wealth
in
profits
to
the
real
owners
and
in
securing
to
the
public
the
full
benefit
of
the
concentrated
administration
we
believe
that
with
concentration
in
administration
there
can
come
both
be
advantage
of
a
larger
ownership
and
of
a
more
equitable
distribution
of
profits
and
at
the
same
time
a
better
service
to
the
commonwealth
we
believe
that
the
administration
should
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
many
and
that
greed
and
rascality
practiced
on
a
large
scale
should
be
punished
as
relentlessly
as
if
practiced
on
a
small
scale
we
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
the
problem
will
be
solved
by
any
short
and
easy
method
the
solution
will
come
only
by
pressing
various
concurrent
remedies
some
of
these
remedies
must
lie
outside
the
domain
of
all
government
some
must
lie
outside
the
domain
of
the
federal
government
but
there
is
legislation
which
the
federal
government
alone
can
enact
and
which
is
absolutely
vital
in
order
to
secure
the
attainment
of
our
purpose
many
laws
are
needed
there
should
be
regulation
by
the
national
government
of
the
great
interstate
corporations
including
a
simple
method
of
account
keeping
publicity
supervision
of
the
issue
securities
abolition
of
rebates
and
of
special
privileges
there
should
be
short
time
franchises
for
all
corporations
engaged
in
public
business
including
the
corporations
which
get
power
from
water
rights
there
should
be
national
as
well
as
state
guardianship
of
mines
and
forests
the
labor
legislation
hereinafter
referred
to
should
concurrently
be
enacted
into
law
to
accomplish
this
means
of
course
a
certain
increase
in
the
use
ofnot
the
creation
ofpower
by
the
central
government
the
power
already
exists
it
does
not
have
to
be
created
the
only
question
is
whether
it
shall
be
used
or
left
idleand
meanwhile
the
corporations
over
which
the
power
ought
to
be
exercised
will
not
remain
idle
let
those
who
object
to
this
increase
in
the
use
of
the
only
power
available
the
national
power
be
frank
and
admit
openly
that
they
propose
to
abandon
any
effort
to
control
the
great
business
corporations
and
to
exercise
supervision
over
the
accumulation
and
distribution
of
wealth
for
such
supervision
and
control
can
only
come
through
this
particular
kind
of
increase
of
power
we
no
more
believe
in
that
empiricism
which
demand
absolutely
unrestrained
individualism
than
we
do
in
that
empiricism
which
clamors
for
a
deadening
socialism
which
would
destroy
all
individual
initiative
and
would
ruin
the
country
with
a
completeness
that
not
even
an
unrestrained
individualism
itself
could
achieve
the
danger
to
american
democracy
lies
not
in
the
least
in
the
concentration
of
administrative
power
in
responsible
and
accountable
hands
it
lies
in
having
the
power
insufficiently
concentrated
so
that
no
one
can
be
held
responsible
to
the
people
for
its
use
concentrated
power
is
palpable
visible
responsible
easily
reached
quickly
held
to
account
power
scattered
through
many
administrators
many
legislators
many
men
who
work
behind
and
through
legislators
and
administrators
is
impalpable
is
unseen
is
irresponsible
can
not
be
reached
can
not
be
held
to
account
democracy
is
in
peril

wherever
the
administration
of
political
power
is
scattered
among
a
variety
of
men
who
work
in
secret
whose
very
names
are
unknown
to
the
common
people
it
is
not
in
peril
from
any
man
who
derives
authority
from
the
people
who
exercises
it
in
sight
of
the
people
and
who
is
from
time
to
time
compelled
to
give
an
account
of
its
exercise
to
the
people
labor
there
are
many
matters
affecting
labor
and
the
status
of
the
wageworker
to
which
i
should
like
to
draw
your
attention
but
an
exhaustive
discussion
of
the
problem
in
all
its
aspects
is
not
now
necessary
this
administration
is
nearing
its
end
and
moreover
under
our
form
of
government
the
solution
of
the
problem
depends
upon
the
action
of
the
states
as
much
as
upon
the
action
of
the
nation
nevertheless
there
are
certain
considerations
which
i
wish
to
set
before
you
because
i
hope
that
our
people
will
more
and
more
keep
them
in
mind
a
blind
and
ignorant
resistance
to
every
effort
for
the
reform
of
abuses
and
for
the
readjustment
of
society
to
modern
industrial
conditions
represents
not
true
conservatism
but
an
incitement
to
the
wildest
radicalism
for
wise
radicalism
and
wise
conservatism
go
hand
in
hand
one
bent
on
progress
the
other
bent
on
seeing
that
no
change
is
made
unless
in
the
right
direction
i
believe
in
a
steady
effort
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
in
steady
efforts
in
many
different
directions
to
bring
about
a
condition
of
affairs
under
which
the
men
who
work
with
hand
or
with
brain
the
laborers
the
superintendents
the
men
who
produce
for
the
market
and
the
men
who
find
a
market
for
the
articles
produced
shall
own
a
far
greater
share
than
at
present
of
the
wealth
they
produce
and
be
enabled
to
invest
it
in
the
tools
and
instruments
by
which
all
work
is
carried
on
as
far
as
possible
i
hope
to
see
a
frank
recognition
of
the
advantages
conferred
by
machinery
organization
and
division
of
labor
accompanied
by
an
effort
to
bring
about
a
larger
share
in
the
ownership
by
wageworker
of
railway
mill
and
factory
in
farming
this
simply
means
that
we
wish
to
see
the
farmer
own
his
own
land
we
do
not
wish
to
see
the
farms
so
large
that
they
become
the
property
of
absentee
landlords
who
farm
them
by
tenants
nor
yet
so
small
that
the
farmer
becomes
like
a
european
peasant
again
the
depositors
in
our
savings
banks
now
number
over
onetenth
of
our
entire
population
these
are
all
capitalists
who
through
the
savings
banks
loan
their
money
to
the
workersthat
is
in
many
cases
to
themselvesto
carry
on
their
various
industries
the
more
we
increase
their
number
the
more
we
introduce
the
principles
of
cooperation
into
our
industry
every
increase
in
the
number
of
small
stockholders
in
corporations
is
a
good
thing
for
the
same
reasons
and
where
the
employees
are
the
stockholders
the
result
is
particularly
good
very
much
of
this
movement
must
be
outside
of
anything
that
can
be
accomplished
by
legislation
but
legislation
can
do
a
good
deal
postal
savings
banks
will
make
it
easy
for
the
poorest
to
keep
their
savings
in
absolute
safety
the
regulation
of
the
national
highways
must
be
such
that
they
shall
serve
all
people
with
equal
justice
corporate
finances
must
be
supervised
so
as
to
make
it
far
safer
than
at
present
for
the
man
of
small
means
to
invest
his
money
in
stocks
there
must
be
prohibition
of
child
labor
diminution
of
woman
labor
shortening
of
hours
of
all
mechanical
labor
stock
watering
should
be
prohibited
and
stock
gambling
so
far
as
is
possible
discouraged
there
should
be
a
progressive
inheritance
tax
on
large
fortunes
industrial
education
should
be
encouraged
as
far
as
possible
we
should
lighten
the
burden
of
taxation
on
the
small
man
we
should
put
a
premium
upon
thrift
hard
work
and
business
energy
but
these
qualities
cease
to
be
the
main
factors
in
accumulating
a
fortune
long
before
that
fortune
reaches
a
point
where
it
would
be
seriously
affected
by
any
inheritance
tax
such
as
i
propose
it
is
eminently
right
that
the
nation
should
fix
the
terms
upon
which
the
great
fortunes
are
inherited
they
rarely
do
good
and
they
often
do
harm
to
those
who
inherit
them
in
their
entirety
protection
for
wageworkers
the
above
is
the
merest
sketch
hardly
even
a
sketch
in
outline
of
the
reforms
for
which
we
should
work
but
there
is
one
matter
with
which
the
congress
should
deal
at
this
session
there
should
no
longer
be
any
paltering
with
the
question
of
taking
care
of
the
wageworkers
who
under
our
present
industrial
system
become
killed
crippled
or
worn
out
as
part
of
the
regular
incidents
of
a
given
business
the
majority
of
wageworkers
must
have
their
rights
secured
for
them
by
state
action
but
the
national
government
should
legislate
in
thoroughgoing
and
farreaching
fashion
not
only
for
all
employees
of
the
national
government
but
for
all
persons
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
the
object
sought
for
could
be
achieved
to
a
measurable
degree
as
far
as
those
killed
or
crippled
are
concerned
by
proper
employers
liability
laws
as
far
as
concerns
those
who
have
been
worn
out
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
definite
steps
toward
providing
oldage
pensions
have
been
taken
in
many
of
our
private
industries
these
may
be
indefinitely
extended
through
voluntary
association
and
contributory
schemes
or
through
the
agency
of
savings
banks
as
under
the
recent
massachusetts
plan
to
strengthen
these
practical
measures
should
be
our
immediate
duty
it
is
not
at
present
necessary
to
consider
the
larger
and
more
general
governmental
schemes
that
most
european
governments
have
found
themselves
obliged
to
adopt
our
present
system
or
rather
no
system
works
dreadful
wrong
and
is
of
benefit
to
only
one
class
of
peoplethe
lawyers
when
a
workman
is
injured
what
he
needs
is
not
an
expensive
and
doubtful
lawsuit
but
the
certainty
of
relief
through
immediate
administrative
action
the
number
of
accidents
which
result
in
the
death
or
crippling
of
wageworkers
in
the
union
at
large
is
simply
appalling
in
a
very
few
years
it
runs
up
a
total
far
in
excess
of
the
aggregate
of
the
dead
and
wounded
in
any
modern
war
no
academic
theory
about
freedom
of
contract
or
constitutional
liberty
to
contract
should
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
this
and
similar
movements
progress
in
civilization
has
everywhere
meant
a
limitation
and
regulation
of
contract
i
call
your
especial
attention
to
the
bulletin
of
the
bureau
of
labor
which
gives
a
statement
of
the
methods
of
treating
the
unemployed
in
european
countries
as
this
is
a
subject
which
in
germany
for
instance
is
treated
in
connection
with
making
provision
for
wornout
and
crippled
workmen
pending
a
thoroughgoing
investigation
and
action
there
is
certain
legislation
which
should
be
enacted
at
once
the
law
passed
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
granting
compensation
to
certain
classes
of
employees
of
the
government
should
be
extended
to
include
all
employees
of
the
government
and
should
be
made
more
liberal
in
its
terms
there
is
no
good
ground
for
the
distinction
made
in
the
law
between
those
engaged
in
hazardous
occupations
and
those
not
so
engaged
if
a
man
is
injured
or
killed
in
any
line
of
work
it
was
hazardous
in
his
case
whether
per
cent
or
per
cent
of
those
following
a
given
occupation
actually
suffer
injury
or
death
ought
not
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
question
of
their
receiving
compensation
it
is
a
grim
logic
which
says
to
an
injured
employee
or
to
the
dependents
of
one
killed
that
he
or
they
are
entitled
to
no
compensation
because
very
few
people
other
than
he
have
been
injured
or
killed
in
that
occupation
perhaps
one
of
the
most
striking
omissions
in
the
law
is
that
it
does
not
embrace
peace
officers
and
others
whose
lives
may
be
sacrificed
in
enforcing
the
laws
of
the
united
states
the
terms
of
the
act
providing
compensation
should
be
made
more
liberal
than
in
the
present
act
a
years
compensation
is
not
adequate
for
a
wageearners
family
in
the
event
of
his
death
by
accident
in
the
course
of
his
employment
and
in
the
event
of
death
occurring
say
ten
or
eleven
months
after
the
accident
the
family
would
only
receive
as
compensation
the
equivalent
of
one
or
two
months
earnings
in
this
respect
the
generosity
of
the
united
states
towards
its
employees
compares
most
unfavorably
with
that
of
every
country
in
europeeven
the
poorest
the
terms
of
the
act
are
also
a
hardship
in
prohibiting
payment
in
cases
where
the
accident
is
in
any
way
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
employee
it
is
inevitable
that
daily
familiarity
with
danger
will
lead
men
to
take
chances
that
can
be
construed
into
negligence
so
well
is
this
recognized
that
in
practically
all
countries
in
the
civilized
world
except
the
united
states
only
a
great
degree
of
negligence
acts
as
a
bar
to
securing
compensation
probably
in
no
other
respect
is
our
legislation
both
state
and
national
so
far
behind
practically
the
entire
civilized
world
as
in
the
matter
of
liability
and
compensation
for
accidents
in
industry
it
is
humiliating
that
at
european
international
congresses
on
accidents
the
united
states
should
be
singled
out
as
the
most
belated
among
the
nations
in
respect
to
employers
liability
legislation
this
government
is
itself
a
large
employer
of
labor
and
in
its
dealings
with
its
employees
it
should
set
a
standard
in
this
country
which
would
place
it
on
a
par
with
the
most
progressive
countries
in
europe
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
this
respect
and
the
laws
of
european
countries
have
been
summarized
in
a
recent
bulletin
of
the
bureau
of
labor
and
no
american
who
reads
this
summary
can
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
great
contrast
between
our
practices
and
theirsa
contrast
not
in
any
sense
to
our
credit
the
congress
should
without
further
delay
pass
a
model
employers
liability
law
for
the
district
of
columbia
the
employers
liability
act
recently
declared
unconstitutional
on
account
of
apparently
including
in
its
provisions
employees
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce
as
well
as
those
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
has
been
held
by
the
local
courts
to
be
still
in
effect
so
far
as
its
provisions
apply
to
distri
ct
of
columbia
there
should
be
no
ambiguity
on
this
point
if
there
is
any
doubt
on
the
subject
the
law
should
be
reenacted
with
special
reference
to
the
district
of
columbia
this
act
however
applies
only
to
employees
of
common
carriers
in
all
other
occupations
the
liability
law
of
the
district
is
the
old
common
law
the
severity
and
injustice
of
the
common
law
in
this
matter
has
been
in
some
degree
or
another
modified
in
the
majority
of
our
states
and
the
only
jurisdiction
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
congress
should
be
ahead
and
not
behind
the
states
of
the
union
in
this
respect
a
comprehensive
employers
liability
law
should
be
passed
for
the
district
of
columbia
i
renew
my
recommendation
made
in
a
previous
message
that
halfholidays
be
granted
during
summer
to
all
wageworkers
in
government
employ
i
also
renew
my
recommendation
that
the
principle
of
the
eighthour
day
should
as
rapidly
and
as
far
as
practicable
be
extended
to
the
entire
work
being
carried
on
by
the
government
the
present
law
should
be
amended
to
embrace
contracts
on
those
public
works
which
the
present
wording
of
the
act
seems
to
exclude
the
courts
i
most
earnestly
urge
upon
the
congress
the
duty
of
increasing
the
totally
inadequate
salaries
now
given
to
our
judges
on
the
whole
there
is
no
body
of
public
servants
who
do
as
valuable
work
nor
whose
moneyed
reward
is
so
inadequate
compared
to
their
work
beginning
with
the
supreme
court
the
judges
should
have
their
salaries
doubled
it
is
not
befitting
the
dignity
of
the
nation
that
its
most
honored
public
servants
should
be
paid
sums
so
small
compared
to
what
they
would
earn
in
private
life
that
the
performance
of
public
service
by
them
implies
an
exceedingly
heavy
pecuniary
sacrifice
it
is
earnestly
to
be
desired
that
some
method
should
be
devised
for
doing
away
with
the
long
delays
which
now
obtain
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
which
operate
with
peculiar
severity
against
persons
of
small
means
and
favor
only
the
very
criminals
whom
it
is
most
desirable
to
punish
these
long
delays
in
the
final
decisions
of
cases
make
in
the
aggregate
a
crying
evil
and
a
remedy
should
be
devised
much
of
this
intolerable
delay
is
due
to
improper
regard
paid
to
technicalities
which
are
a
mere
hindrance
to
justice
in
some
noted
recent
cases
this
overregard
for
technicalities
has
resulted
in
a
striking
denial
of
justice
and
flagrant
wrong
to
the
body
politic
at
the
last
election
certain
leaders
of
organized
labor
made
a
violent
and
sweeping
attack
upon
the
entire
judiciary
of
the
country
an
attack
couched
in
such
terms
as
to
include
the
most
upright
honest
and
broadminded
judges
no
less
than
those
of
narrower
mind
and
more
restricted
outlook
it
was
the
kind
of
attack
admirably
fitted
to
prevent
any
successful
attempt
to
reform
abuses
of
the
judiciary
because
it
gave
the
champions
of
the
unjust
judge
their
eagerly
desired
opportunity
to
shift
their
ground
into
a
championship
of
just
judges
who
were
unjustly
assailed
last
year
before
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
these
same
labor
leaders
formulated
their
demands
specifying
the
bill
that
contained
them
refusing
all
compromise
stating
they
wished
the
principle
of
that
bill
or
nothing
they
insisted
on
a
provision
that
in
a
labor
dispute
no
injunction
should
issue
except
to
protect
a
property
right
and
specifically
provided
that
the
right
to
carry
on
business
should
not
be
construed
as
a
property
right
and
in
a
second
provision
their
bill
made
legal
in
a
labor
dispute
any
act
or
agreement
by
or
between
two
or
more
persons
that
would
not
have
been
unlawful
if
done
by
a
single
person
in
other
words
this
bill
legalized
blacklisting
and
boycotting
in
every
form
legalizing
for
instance
those
forms
of
the
secondary
boycott
which
the
anthracite
coal
strike
commission
so
unreservedly
condemned
while
the
right
to
carry
on
a
business
was
explicitly
taken
out
from
under
that
protection
which
the
law
throws
over
property
the
demand
was
made
that
there
should
be
trial
by
jury
in
contempt
cases
thereby
most
seriously
impairing
the
authority
of
the
courts
all
this
represented
a
course
of
policy
which
if
carried
out
would
mean
the
enthronement
of
class
privilege
in
its
crudest
and
most
brutal
form
and
the
destruction
of
one
of
the
most
essential
functions
of
the
judiciary
in
all
civilized
lands
the
violence
of
the
crusade
for
this
legislation
and
its
complete
failure
illustrate
two
truths
which
it
is
essential
our
people
should
learn
in
the
first
place
they
ought
to
teach
the
workingman
the
laborer
the
wageworker
that
by
demanding
what
is
improper
and
impossible
he
plays
into
the
hands
of
his
foes
such
a
crude
and
vicious
attack
upon
the
courts
even
if
it
were
temporarily
successful
would
inevitably
in
the
end
cause
a
violent
reaction
and
would
band
the
great
mass
of
citizens
together
forcing
them
to
stand
by
all
the
judges
competent
and
incompetent
alike
rather
than
to
see
the
wheels
of
justice
stopped
a
movement
of
this
kind
can
ultimately
result
in
nothing
but
damage
to
those
in
whose
behalf
it
is
nominally
undertaken
this
is
a
most
healthy
truth
which
it
is
wise
for
all
our
people
to
learn
any
movement
based
on
that
class
hatred
which
at
times
assumes
the
name
of
class
consciousness
is
certain
ultimately
to
fail
and
if
it
temporarily
succeeds
to
do
farreaching
damage
class
consciousness
where
it
is
merely
another
name
for
the
odious
vice
of
class
selfishness
is
equally
noxious
whether
in
an
employers
association
or
in
a
workingmans
association
the
movement
in
question
was
one
in
which
the
appeal
was
made
to
all
workingmen
to
vote
primarily
not
as
american
citizens
but
as
individuals
of
a
certain
class
in
society
such
an
appeal
in
the
first
place
revolts
the
more
highminded
and
farsighted
among
the
persons
to
whom
it
is
addressed
and
in
the
second
place
tends
to
arouse
a
strong
antagonism
among
all
other
classes
of
citizens
whom
it
therefore
tends
to
unite
against
the
very
organization
on
whose
behalf
it
is
issued
the
result
is
therefore
unfortunate
from
every
standpoint
this
healthy
truth
by
the
way
will
be
learned
by
the
socialists
if
they
ever
succeed
in
establishing
in
this
country
an
important
national
party
based
on
such
class
consciousness
and
selfish
class
interest
the
wageworkers
the
workingmen
the
laboring
men
of
the
country
by
the
way
in
which
they
repudiated
the
effort
to
get
them
to
cast
their
votes
in
response
to
an
appeal
to
class
hatred
have
emphasized
their
sound
patriotism
and
americanism
the
whole
country
has
cause
to
fell
pride
in
this
attitude
of
sturdy
independence
in
this
uncompromising
insistence
upon
acting
simply
as
good
citizens
as
good
americans
without
regard
to
fanciedand
improperclass
interests
such
an
attitude
is
an
objectlesson
in
good
citizenship
to
the
entire
nation
but
the
extreme
reactionaries
the
persons
who
blind
themselves
to
the
wrongs
now
and
then
committed
by
the
courts
on
laboring
men
should
also
think
seriously
as
to
what
such
a
movement
as
this
portends
the
judges
who
have
shown
themselves
able
and
willing
effectively
to
check
the
dishonest
activity
of
the
very
rich
man
who
works
iniquity
by
the
mismanagement
of
corporations
who
have
shown
themselves
alert
to
do
justice
to
the
wageworker
and
sympathetic
with
the
needs
of
the
mass
of
our
people
so
that
the
dweller
in
the
tenement
houses
the
man
who
practices
a
dangerous
trade
the
man
who
is
crushed
by
excessive
hours
of
labor
feel
that
their
needs
are
understood
by
the
courtsthese
judges
are
the
real
bulwark
of
the
courts
these
judges
the
judges
of
the
stamp
of
the
presidentelect
who
have
been
fearless
in
opposing
labor
when
it
has
gone
wrong
but
fearless
also
in
holding
to
strict
account
corporations
that
work
iniquity
and
farsighted
in
seeing
that
the
workingman
gets
his
rights
are
the
men
of
all
others
to
whom
we
owe
it
that
the
appeal
for
such
violent
and
mistaken
legislation
has
fallen
on
deaf
ears
that
the
agitation
for
its
passage
proved
to
be
without
substantial
basis
the
courts
are
jeopardized
primarily
by
the
action
of
those
federal
and
state
judges
who
show
inability
or
unwillingness
to
put
a
stop
to
the
wrongdoing
of
very
rich
men
under
modern
industrial
conditions
and
inability
or
unwillingness
to
give
relief
to
men
of
small
means
or
wageworkers
who
are
crushed
down
by
these
modern
industrial
conditions
who
in
other
words
fail
to
understand
and
apply
the
needed
remedies
for
the
new
wrongs
produced
by
the
new
and
highly
complex
social
and
industrial
civilization
which
has
grown
up
in
the
last
half
century
the
rapid
changes
in
our
social
and
industrial
life
which
have
attended
this
rapid
growth
have
made
it
necessary
that
in
applying
to
concrete
cases
the
great
rule
of
right
laid
down
in
our
constitution
there
should
be
a
full
understanding
and
appreciation
of
the
new
conditions
to
which
the
rules
are
to
be
applied
what
would
have
been
an
infringement
upon
liberty
half
a
century
ago
may
be
the
necessary
safeguard
of
liberty
today
what
would
have
been
an
injury
to
property
then
may
be
necessary
to
the
enjoyment
of
property
now
every
judicial
decision
involves
two
termsone
as
interpretation
of
the
law
the
other
the
understanding
of
the
facts
to
which
it
is
to
be
applied
the
great
mass
of
our
judicial
officers
are
i
believe
alive
to
those
changes
of
conditions
which
so
materially
affect
the
performance
of
their
judicial
duties
our
judicial
system
is
sound
and
effective
at
core
and
it
remains
and
must
ever
be
maintained
as
the
safeguard
of
those
principles
of
liberty
and
justice
which
stand
at
the
foundation
of
american
institutions
for
as
burke
finely
said
when
liberty
and
justice
are
separated
neither
is
safe
there
are
however
some
members
of
the
judicial
body
who
have
lagged
behind
in
their
understanding
of
these
great
and
vital
changes
in
the
body
politic
whose
minds
have
never
been
opened
to
the
new
applications
of
the
old
principles
made
necessary
by
the
new
conditions
judges
of
this
stamp
do
lasting
harm
by
their
decisions
because
they
convince
poor
men
in
n
eed
of
protection
that
the
courts
of
the
land
are
profoundly
ignorant
of
and
out
of
sympathy
with
their
needs
and
profoundly
indifferent
or
hostile
to
any
proposed
remedy
to
such
men
it
seems
a
cruel
mockery
to
have
any
court
decide
against
them
on
the
ground
that
it
desires
to
preserve
liberty
in
a
purely
technical
form
by
withholding
liberty
in
any
real
and
constructive
sense
it
is
desirable
that
the
legislative
body
should
possess
and
wherever
necessary
exercise
the
power
to
determine
whether
in
a
given
case
employers
and
employees
are
not
on
an
equal
footing
so
that
the
necessities
of
the
latter
compel
them
to
submit
to
such
exactions
as
to
hours
and
conditions
of
labor
as
unduly
to
tax
their
strength
and
only
mischief
can
result
when
such
determination
is
upset
on
the
ground
that
there
must
be
no
interference
with
the
liberty
to
contractoften
a
merely
academic
liberty
the
exercise
of
which
is
the
negation
of
real
liberty
there
are
certain
decisions
by
various
courts
which
have
been
exceedingly
detrimental
to
the
rights
of
wageworkers
this
is
true
of
all
the
decisions
that
decide
that
men
and
women
are
by
the
constitution
guaranteed
their
liberty
to
contract
to
enter
a
dangerous
occupation
or
to
work
an
undesirable
or
improper
number
of
hours
or
to
work
in
unhealthy
surroundings
and
therefore
can
not
recover
damages
when
maimed
in
that
occupation
and
can
not
be
forbidden
to
work
what
the
legislature
decides
is
an
excessive
number
of
hours
or
to
carry
on
the
work
under
conditions
which
the
legislature
decides
to
be
unhealthy
the
most
dangerous
occupations
are
often
the
poorest
paid
and
those
where
the
hours
of
work
are
longest
and
in
many
cases
those
who
go
into
them
are
driven
by
necessity
so
great
that
they
have
practically
no
alternative
decisions
such
as
those
alluded
to
above
nullify
the
legislative
effort
to
protect
the
wageworkers
who
most
need
protection
from
those
employers
who
take
advantage
of
their
grinding
need
they
halt
or
hamper
the
movement
for
securing
better
and
more
equitable
conditions
of
labor
the
talk
about
preserving
to
the
miseryhunted
beings
who
make
contracts
for
such
service
their
liberty
to
make
them
is
either
to
speak
in
a
spirit
of
heartless
irony
or
else
to
show
an
utter
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
conditions
of
life
among
the
great
masses
of
our
fellowcountrymen
a
lack
which
unfits
a
judge
to
do
good
service
just
as
it
would
unfit
any
executive
or
legislative
officer
there
is
also
i
think
ground
for
the
belief
that
substantial
injustice
is
often
suffered
by
employees
in
consequence
of
the
custom
of
courts
issuing
temporary
injunctions
without
notice
to
them
and
punishing
them
for
contempt
of
court
in
instances
where
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
no
knowledge
of
any
proceedings
outside
of
organized
labor
there
is
a
widespread
feeling
that
this
system
often
works
great
injustice
to
wageworkers
when
their
efforts
to
better
their
working
condition
result
in
industrial
disputes
a
temporary
injunction
procured
ex
parte
may
as
a
matter
of
fact
have
all
the
effect
of
a
permanent
injunction
in
causing
disaster
to
the
wageworkers
side
in
such
a
dispute
organized
labor
is
chafing
under
the
unjust
restraint
which
comes
from
repeated
resort
to
this
plan
of
procedure
its
discontent
has
been
unwisely
expressed
and
often
improperly
expressed
but
there
is
a
sound
basis
for
it
and
the
orderly
and
lawabiding
people
of
a
community
would
be
in
a
far
stronger
position
for
upholding
the
courts
if
the
undoubtedly
existing
abuses
could
be
provided
against
such
proposals
as
those
mentioned
above
as
advocated
by
the
extreme
labor
leaders
contain
the
vital
error
of
being
class
legislation
of
the
most
offensive
kind
and
even
if
enacted
into
law
i
believe
that
the
law
would
rightly
be
held
unconstitutional
moreover
the
labor
people
are
themselves
now
beginning
to
invoke
the
use
of
the
power
of
injunction
during
the
last
ten
years
and
within
my
own
knowledge
at
least
fifty
injunctions
have
been
obtained
by
labor
unions
in
new
york
city
alone
most
of
them
being
to
protect
the
union
label
a
property
right
but
some
being
obtained
for
other
reasons
against
employers
the
power
of
injunction
is
a
great
equitable
remedy
which
should
on
no
account
be
destroyed
but
safeguards
should
be
erected
against
its
abuse
i
believe
that
some
such
provisions
as
those
i
advocated
a
year
ago
for
checking
the
abuse
of
the
issuance
of
temporary
injunctions
should
be
adopted
in
substance
provision
should
be
made
that
no
injunction
or
temporary
restraining
order
issue
otherwise
than
on
notice
except
where
irreparable
injury
would
otherwise
result
and
in
such
case
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
order
should
be
had
within
a
short
fixed
period
and
if
not
then
continued
after
hearing
it
should
forthwith
lapse
decisions
should
be
rendered
immediately
and
the
chance
of
delay
minimized
in
every
way
moreover
i
believe
that
the
procedure
should
be
sharply
defined
and
the
judge
required
minutely
to
state
the
particulars
both
of
his
action
and
of
his
reasons
therefor
so
that
the
congress
can
if
it
desires
examine
and
investigate
the
same
the
chief
lawmakers
in
our
country
may
be
and
often
are
the
judges
because
they
are
the
final
seat
of
authority
every
time
they
interpret
contract
property
vested
rights
due
process
of
law
liberty
they
necessarily
enact
into
law
parts
of
a
system
of
social
philosophy
and
as
such
interpretation
is
fundamental
they
give
direction
to
all
lawmaking
the
decisions
of
the
courts
on
economic
and
social
questions
depend
upon
their
economic
and
social
philosophy
and
for
the
peaceful
progress
of
our
people
during
the
twentieth
century
we
shall
owe
most
to
those
judges
who
hold
to
a
twentieth
century
economic
and
social
philosophy
and
not
to
a
long
outgrown
philosophy
which
was
itself
the
product
of
primitive
economic
conditions
of
course
a
judges
views
on
progressive
social
philosophy
are
entirely
second
in
importance
to
his
possession
of
a
high
and
fine
character
which
means
the
possession
of
such
elementary
virtues
as
honesty
courage
and
fairmindedness
the
judge
who
owes
his
election
to
pandering
to
demagogic
sentiments
or
class
hatreds
and
prejudices
and
the
judge
who
owes
either
his
election
or
his
appointment
to
the
money
or
the
favor
of
a
great
corporation
are
alike
unworthy
to
sit
on
the
bench
are
alike
traitors
to
the
people
and
no
profundity
of
legal
learning
or
correctness
of
abstract
conviction
on
questions
of
public
policy
can
serve
as
an
offset
to
such
shortcomings
but
it
is
also
true
that
judges
like
executives
and
legislators
should
hold
sound
views
on
the
questions
of
public
policy
which
are
of
vital
interest
to
the
people
the
legislators
and
executives
are
chosen
to
represent
the
people
in
enacting
and
administering
the
laws
the
judges
are
not
chosen
to
represent
the
people
in
this
sense
their
function
is
to
interpret
the
laws
the
legislators
are
responsible
for
the
laws
the
judges
for
the
spirit
in
which
they
interpret
and
enforce
the
laws
we
stand
aloof
from
the
reckless
agitators
who
would
make
the
judges
mere
pliant
tools
of
popular
prejudice
and
passion
and
we
stand
aloof
from
those
equally
unwise
partisans
of
reaction
and
privilege
who
deny
the
proposition
that
inasmuch
as
judges
are
chosen
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
whole
people
they
should
strive
to
find
out
what
those
interests
are
and
so
far
as
they
conscientiously
can
should
strive
to
give
effect
to
popular
conviction
when
deliberately
and
duly
expressed
by
the
lawmaking
body
the
courts
are
to
be
highly
commended
and
staunchly
upheld
when
they
set
their
faces
against
wrongdoing
or
tyranny
by
a
majority
but
they
are
to
be
blamed
when
they
fail
to
recognize
under
a
government
like
ours
the
deliberate
judgment
of
the
majority
as
to
a
matter
of
legitimate
policy
when
duly
expressed
by
the
legislature
such
lawfully
expressed
and
deliberate
judgment
should
be
given
effect
by
the
courts
save
in
the
extreme
and
exceptional
cases
where
there
has
been
a
clear
violation
of
a
constitutional
provision
anything
like
frivolity
or
wantonness
in
upsetting
such
clearly
taken
governmental
action
is
a
grave
offense
against
the
republic
to
protest
against
tyranny
to
protect
minorities
from
oppression
to
nullify
an
act
committed
in
a
spasm
of
popular
fury
is
to
render
a
service
to
the
republic
but
for
the
courts
to
arrogate
to
themselves
functions
which
properly
belong
to
the
legislative
bodies
is
all
wrong
and
in
the
end
works
mischief
the
people
should
not
be
permitted
to
pardon
evil
and
slipshod
legislation
on
the
theory
that
the
court
will
set
it
right
they
should
be
taught
that
the
right
way
to
get
rid
of
a
bad
law
is
to
have
the
legislature
repeal
it
and
not
to
have
the
courts
by
ingenious
hairsplitting
nullify
it
a
law
may
be
unwise
and
improper
but
it
should
not
for
these
reasons
be
declared
unconstitutional
by
a
strained
interpretation
for
the
result
of
such
action
is
to
take
away
from
the
people
at
large
their
sense
of
responsibility
and
ultimately
to
destroy
their
capacity
for
orderly
self
restraint
and
self
government
under
such
a
popular
government
as
ours
rounded
on
the
theory
that
in
the
long
run
the
will
of
the
people
is
supreme
the
ultimate
safety
of
the
nation
can
only
rest
in
training
and
guiding
the
people
so
that
what
they
will
shall
be
right
and
not
in
devising
means
to
defeat
their
will
by
the
technicalities
of
strained
construction
for
many
of
the
shortcomings
of
justice
in
our
country
our
people
as
a
whole
are
themselves
to
blame
and
the
judges
and
juries
merely
bear
their
share
together
with
the
public
as
a
whole
it
is
discreditable
to
us
as
a
people
that
there
should
be
difficulty
in
convicting
murderers
or
in
bringing
to
justice
men
who
as
public
servants
have
been
guilty
of
corruption
or
who
have
profited
by
the
corruption
of
public
servants
the
result
is
equally
unfortunate
whether
due
to
hairsplitting
technicalities
in
the
interpretation
of
law
by
judges
to
sentimentality
and
class
consciousness
on
the
part
of
juries
or
to
hysteria

and
sensationalism
in
the
daily
press
for
much
of
this
failure
of
justice
no
responsibility
whatever
lies
on
rich
men
as
such
we
who
make
up
the
mass
of
the
people
can
not
shift
the
responsibility
from
our
own
shoulders
but
there
is
an
important
part
of
the
failure
which
has
specially
to
do
with
inability
to
hold
to
proper
account
men
of
wealth
who
behave
badly
the
chief
breakdown
is
in
dealing
with
the
new
relations
that
arise
from
the
mutualism
the
interdependence
of
our
time
every
new
social
relation
begets
a
new
type
of
wrongdoingof
sin
to
use
an
oldfashioned
wordand
many
years
always
elapse
before
society
is
able
to
turn
this
sin
into
crime
which
can
be
effectively
punished
at
law
during
the
lifetime
of
the
older
men
now
alive
the
social
relations
have
changed
far
more
rapidly
than
in
the
preceding
two
centuries
the
immense
growth
of
corporations
of
business
done
by
associations
and
the
extreme
strain
and
pressure
of
modern
life
have
produced
conditions
which
render
the
public
confused
as
to
who
its
really
dangerous
foes
are
and
among
the
public
servants
who
have
not
only
shared
this
confusion
but
by
some
of
their
acts
have
increased
it
are
certain
judges
marked
inefficiency
has
been
shown
in
dealing
with
corporations
and
in
resettling
the
proper
attitude
to
be
taken
by
the
public
not
only
towards
corporations
but
towards
labor
and
towards
the
social
questions
arising
out
of
the
factory
system
and
the
enormous
growth
of
our
great
cities
the
huge
wealth
that
has
been
accumulated
by
a
few
individuals
of
recent
years
in
what
has
amounted
to
a
social
and
industrial
revolution
has
been
as
regards
some
of
these
individuals
made
possible
only
by
the
improper
use
of
the
modern
corporation
a
certain
type
of
modern
corporation
with
its
officers
and
agents
its
many
issues
of
securities
and
its
constant
consolidation
with
allied
undertakings
finally
becomes
an
instrument
so
complex
as
to
contain
a
greater
number
of
elements
that
under
various
judicial
decisions
lend
themselves
to
fraud
and
oppression
than
any
device
yet
evolved
in
the
human
brain
corporations
are
necessary
instruments
of
modern
business
they
have
been
permitted
to
become
a
menace
largely
because
the
governmental
representatives
of
the
people
have
worked
slowly
in
providing
for
adequate
control
over
them
the
chief
offender
in
any
given
case
may
be
an
executive
a
legislature
or
a
judge
every
executive
head
who
advises
violent
instead
of
gradual
action
or
who
advocates
illconsidered
and
sweeping
measures
of
reform
especially
if
they
are
tainted
with
vindictiveness
and
disregard
for
the
rights
of
the
minority
is
particularly
blameworthy
the
several
legislatures
are
responsible
for
the
fact
that
our
laws
are
often
prepared
with
slovenly
haste
and
lack
of
consideration
moreover
they
are
often
prepared
and
still
more
frequently
amended
during
passage
at
the
suggestion
of
the
very
parties
against
whom
they
are
afterwards
enforced
our
great
clusters
of
corporations
huge
trusts
and
fabulously
wealthy
multimillionaires
employ
the
very
best
lawyers
they
can
obtain
to
pick
flaws
in
these
statutes
after
their
passage
but
they
also
employ
a
class
of
secret
agents
who
seek
under
the
advice
of
experts
to
render
hostile
legislation
innocuous
by
making
it
unconstitutional
often
through
the
insertion
of
what
appear
on
their
face
to
be
drastic
and
sweeping
provisions
against
the
interests
of
the
parties
inspiring
them
while
the
demagogues
the
corrupt
creatures
who
introduce
blackmailing
schemes
to
strike
corporations
and
all
who
demand
extreme
and
undesirably
radical
measures
show
themselves
to
be
the
worst
enemies
of
the
very
public
whose
loudmouthed
champions
they
profess
to
be
a
very
striking
illustration
of
the
consequences
of
carelessness
in
the
preparation
of
a
statute
was
the
employers
liability
law
of
in
the
cases
arising
under
that
law
four
out
of
six
courts
of
first
instance
held
it
unconstitutional
six
out
of
nine
justices
of
the
supreme
court
held
that
its
subjectmatter
was
within
the
province
of
congressional
action
and
four
of
the
nine
justices
held
it
valid
it
was
however
adjudged
unconstitutional
by
a
bare
majority
of
the
courtfive
to
four
it
was
surely
a
very
slovenly
piece
of
work
to
frame
the
legislation
in
such
shape
as
to
leave
the
question
open
at
all
real
damage
has
been
done
by
the
manifold
and
conflicting
interpretations
of
the
interstate
commerce
law
control
over
the
great
corporations
doing
interstate
business
can
be
effective
only
if
it
is
vested
with
full
power
in
an
administrative
department
a
branch
of
the
federal
executive
carrying
out
a
federal
law
it
can
never
be
effective
if
a
divided
responsibility
is
left
in
both
the
states
and
the
nation
it
can
never
be
effective
if
left
in
the
hands
of
the
courts
to
be
decided
by
lawsuits
the
courts
hold
a
place
of
peculiar
and
deserved
sanctity
under
our
form
of
government
respect
for
the
law
is
essential
to
the
permanence
of
our
institutions
and
respect
for
the
law
is
largely
conditioned
upon
respect
for
the
courts
it
is
an
offense
against
the
republic
to
say
anything
which
can
weaken
this
respect
save
for
the
gravest
reason
and
in
the
most
carefully
guarded
manner
our
judges
should
be
held
in
peculiar
honor
and
the
duty
of
respectful
and
truthful
comment
and
criticism
which
should
be
binding
when
we
speak
of
anybody
should
be
especially
binding
when
we
speak
of
them
on
an
average
they
stand
above
any
other
servants
of
the
community
and
the
greatest
judges
have
reached
the
high
level
held
by
those
few
greatest
patriots
whom
the
whole
country
delights
to
honor
but
we
must
face
the
fact
that
there
are
wise
and
unwise
judges
just
as
there
are
wise
and
unwise
executives
and
legislators
when
a
president
or
a
governor
behaves
improperly
or
unwisely
the
remedy
is
easy
for
his
term
is
short
the
same
is
true
with
the
legislator
although
not
to
the
same
degree
for
he
is
one
of
many
who
belong
to
some
given
legislative
body
and
it
is
therefore
less
easy
to
fix
his
personal
responsibility
and
hold
him
accountable
therefor
with
a
judge
who
being
human
is
also
likely
to
err
but
whose
tenure
is
for
life
there
is
no
similar
way
of
holding
him
to
responsibility
under
ordinary
conditions
the
only
forms
of
pressure
to
which
he
is
in
any
way
amenable
are
public
opinion
and
the
action
of
his
fellow
judges
it
is
the
last
which
is
most
immediately
effective
and
to
which
we
should
look
for
the
reform
of
abuses
any
remedy
applied
from
without
is
fraught
with
risk
it
is
far
better
from
every
standpoint
that
the
remedy
should
come
from
within
in
no
other
nation
in
the
world
do
the
courts
wield
such
vast
and
farreaching
power
as
in
the
united
states
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
the
courts
as
a
whole
should
exercise
this
power
with
the
farsighted
wisdom
already
shown
by
those
judges
who
scan
the
future
while
they
act
in
the
present
let
them
exercise
this
great
power
not
only
honestly
and
bravely
but
with
wise
insight
into
the
needs
and
fixed
purposes
of
the
people
so
that
they
may
do
justice
and
work
equity
so
that
they
may
protect
all
persons
in
their
rights
and
yet
break
down
the
barriers
of
privilege
which
is
the
foe
of
right
forests
if
there
is
any
one
duty
which
more
than
another
we
owe
it
to
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
to
perform
at
once
it
is
to
save
the
forests
of
this
country
for
they
constitute
the
first
and
most
important
element
in
the
conservation
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
there
are
of
course
two
kinds
of
natural
resources
one
is
the
kind
which
can
only
be
used
as
part
of
a
process
of
exhaustion
this
is
true
of
mines
natural
oil
and
gas
wells
and
the
like
the
other
and
of
course
ultimately
by
far
the
most
important
includes
the
resources
which
can
be
improved
in
the
process
of
wise
use
the
soil
the
rivers
and
the
forests
come
under
this
head
any
really
civilized
nation
will
so
use
all
of
these
three
great
national
assets
that
the
nation
will
have
their
benefit
in
the
future
just
as
a
farmer
after
all
his
life
making
his
living
from
his
farm
will
if
he
is
an
expert
farmer
leave
it
as
an
asset
of
increased
value
to
his
son
so
we
should
leave
our
national
domain
to
our
children
increased
in
value
and
not
worn
out
there
are
small
sections
of
our
own
country
in
the
east
and
the
west
in
the
adriondacks
the
white
mountains
and
the
appalachians
and
in
the
rocky
mountains
where
we
can
already
see
for
ourselves
the
damage
in
the
shape
of
permanent
injury
to
the
soil
and
the
river
systems
which
comes
from
reckless
deforestation
it
matters
not
whether
this
deforestation
is
due
to
the
actual
reckless
cutting
of
timber
to
the
fires
that
inevitably
follow
such
reckless
cutting
of
timber
or
to
reckless
and
uncontrolled
grazing
especially
by
the
great
migratory
bands
of
sheep
the
unchecked
wandering
of
which
over
the
country
means
destruction
to
forests
and
disaster
to
the
small
home
makers
the
settlers
of
limited
means
shortsighted
persons
or
persons
blinded
to
the
future
by
desire
to
make
money
in
every
way
out
of
the
present
sometimes
speak
as
if
no
great
damage
would
be
done
by
the
reckless
destruction
of
our
forests
it
is
difficult
to
have
patience
with
the
arguments
of
these
persons
thanks
to
our
own
recklessness
in
the
use
of
our
splendid
forests
we
have
already
crossed
the
verge
of
a
timber
famine
in
this
country
and
no
measures
that
we
now
take
can
at
least
for
many
years
undo
the
mischief
that
has
already
been
done
but
we
can
prevent
further
mischief
being
done
and
it
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
reprehensible
to
let
any
consideration
of
temporary
convenience
or
temporary
cost
interfere
with
such
action
especially
as
regards
the
national
forests
which
the
nation
can
now
at
this
very
moment
control
all
serious
students
of
the
question
are
aware
of
the
great
damage
that
has
been
done
in
the
mediterranean
countries
of
europe
asia
and
africa
by
deforestation
the
similar
damage
that
has
been
done
in
eastern
asia
is
less
well
known
a
recent
investigation
into
conditions
in
north
china
by
mr
fran
k
n
meyer
of
the
bureau
of
plant
industry
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
has
incidentally
furnished
in
very
striking
fashion
proof
of
the
ruin
that
comes
from
reckless
deforestation
of
mountains
and
of
the
further
fact
that
the
damage
once
done
may
prove
practically
irreparable
so
important
are
these
investigations
that
i
herewith
attach
as
an
appendix
to
my
message
certain
photographs
showing
present
conditions
in
china
they
show
in
vivid
fashion
the
appalling
desolation
taking
the
shape
of
barren
mountains
and
gravel
and
sandcovered
plains
which
immediately
follows
and
depends
upon
the
deforestation
of
the
mountains
not
many
centuries
ago
the
country
of
northern
china
was
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
beautiful
spots
in
the
entire
world
and
was
heavily
forested
we
know
this
not
only
from
the
old
chinese
records
but
from
the
accounts
given
by
the
traveler
marco
polo
he
for
instance
mentions
that
in
visiting
the
provinces
of
shansi
and
shensi
he
observed
many
plantations
of
mulberry
trees
now
there
is
hardly
a
single
mulberry
tree
in
either
of
these
provinces
and
the
culture
of
the
silkworm
has
moved
farther
south
to
regions
of
atmospheric
moisture
as
an
illustration
of
the
complete
change
in
the
rivers
we
may
take
polos
statement
that
a
certain
river
the
hun
ho
was
so
large
and
deep
that
merchants
ascended
it
from
the
sea
with
heavily
laden
boats
today
this
river
is
simply
a
broad
sandy
bed
with
shallow
rapid
currents
wandering
hither
and
thither
across
it
absolutely
unnavigable
but
we
do
not
have
to
depend
upon
written
records
the
dry
wells
and
the
wells
with
water
far
below
the
former
watermark
bear
testimony
to
the
good
days
of
the
past
and
the
evil
days
of
the
present
wherever
the
native
vegetation
has
been
allowed
to
remain
as
for
instance
here
and
there
around
a
sacred
temple
or
imperial
burying
ground
there
are
still
huge
trees
and
tangled
jungle
fragments
of
the
glorious
ancient
forests
the
thick
matted
forest
growth
formerly
covered
the
mountains
to
their
summits
all
natural
factors
favored
this
dense
forest
growth
and
as
long
as
it
was
permitted
to
exist
the
plains
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
were
among
the
most
fertile
on
the
globe
and
the
whole
country
was
a
garden
not
the
slightest
effort
was
made
however
to
prevent
the
unchecked
cutting
of
the
trees
or
to
secure
reforestation
doubtless
for
many
centuries
the
treecutting
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountains
worked
but
slowly
in
bringing
about
the
changes
that
have
now
come
to
pass
doubtless
for
generations
the
inroads
were
scarcely
noticeable
but
there
came
a
time
when
the
forest
had
shrunk
sufficiently
to
make
each
years
cutting
a
serious
matter
and
from
that
time
on
the
destruction
proceeded
with
appalling
rapidity
for
of
course
each
year
of
destruction
rendered
the
forest
less
able
to
recuperate
less
able
to
resist
next
years
inroad
mr
meyer
describes
the
ceaseless
progress
of
the
destruction
even
now
when
there
is
so
little
left
to
destroy
every
morning
men
and
boys
go
out
armed
with
mattox
or
axe
scale
the
steepest
mountain
sides
and
cut
down
and
grub
out
root
and
branch
the
small
trees
and
shrubs
still
to
be
found
the
big
trees
disappeared
centuries
ago
so
that
now
one
of
these
is
never
seen
save
in
the
neighborhood
of
temples
where
they
are
artificially
protected
and
even
here
it
takes
all
the
watch
and
care
of
the
treeloving
priests
to
prevent
their
destruction
each
family
each
community
where
there
is
no
common
care
exercised
in
the
interest
of
all
of
them
to
prevent
deforestation
finds
its
profit
in
the
immediate
use
of
the
fuel
which
would
otherwise
be
used
by
some
other
family
or
some
other
community
in
the
total
absence
of
regulation
of
the
matter
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
people
each
small
group
is
inevitably
pushed
into
a
policy
of
destruction
which
can
not
afford
to
take
thought
for
the
morrow
this
is
just
one
of
those
matters
which
it
is
fatal
to
leave
to
unsupervised
individual
control
the
forest
can
only
be
protected
by
the
state
by
the
nation
and
the
liberty
of
action
of
individuals
must
be
conditioned
upon
what
the
state
or
nation
determines
to
be
necessary
for
the
common
safety
the
lesson
of
deforestation
in
china
is
a
lesson
which
mankind
should
have
learned
many
times
already
from
what
has
occurred
in
other
places
denudation
leaves
naked
soil
then
gullying
cuts
down
to
the
bare
rock
and
meanwhile
the
rockwaste
buries
the
bottomlands
when
the
soil
is
gone
men
must
go
and
the
process
does
not
take
long
this
ruthless
destruction
of
the
forests
in
northern
china
has
brought
about
or
has
aided
in
bringing
about
desolation
just
as
the
destruction
of
the
forests
in
central
asia
aid
in
bringing
ruin
to
the
once
rich
central
asian
cities
just
as
the
destruction
of
the
forest
in
northern
africa
helped
towards
the
ruin
of
a
region
that
was
a
fertile
granary
in
roman
days
shortsighted
man
whether
barbaric
semicivilized
or
what
he
mistakenly
regards
as
fully
civilized
when
he
has
destroyed
the
forests
has
rendered
certain
the
ultimate
destruction
of
the
land
itself
in
northern
china
the
mountains
are
now
such
as
are
shown
by
the
accompanying
photographs
absolutely
barren
peaks
not
only
have
the
forests
been
destroyed
but
because
of
their
destruction
the
soil
has
been
washed
off
the
naked
rock
the
terrible
consequence
is
that
it
is
impossible
now
to
undo
the
damage
that
has
been
done
many
centuries
would
have
to
pass
before
soil
would
again
collect
or
could
be
made
to
collect
in
sufficient
quantity
once
more
to
support
the
oldtime
forest
growth
in
consequence
the
mongol
desert
is
practically
extending
eastward
over
northern
china
the
climate
has
changed
and
is
still
changing
it
has
changed
even
within
the
last
half
century
as
the
work
of
tree
destruction
has
been
consummated
the
great
masses
of
arboreal
vegetation
on
the
mountains
formerly
absorbed
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
sent
up
currents
of
cool
air
which
brought
the
moistureladen
clouds
lower
and
forced
them
to
precipitate
in
rain
a
part
of
their
burden
of
water
now
that
there
is
no
vegetation
the
barren
mountains
scorched
by
the
sun
send
up
currents
of
heated
air
which
drive
away
instead
of
attracting
the
rain
clouds
and
cause
their
moisture
to
be
disseminated
in
consequence
instead
of
the
regular
and
plentiful
rains
which
existed
in
these
regions
of
china
when
the
forests
were
still
in
evidence
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
of
the
deforested
lands
now
see
their
crops
wither
for
lack
of
rainfall
while
the
seasons
grow
more
and
more
irregular
and
as
the
air
becomes
dryer
certain
crops
refuse
longer
to
grow
at
all
that
everything
dries
out
faster
than
formerly
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
level
of
the
wells
all
over
the
land
has
sunk
perceptibly
many
of
them
having
become
totally
dry
in
addition
to
the
resulting
agricultural
distress
the
watercourses
have
changed
formerly
they
were
narrow
and
deep
with
an
abundance
of
clear
water
the
year
around
for
the
roots
and
humus
of
the
forests
caught
the
rainwater
and
let
it
escape
by
slow
regular
seepage
they
have
now
become
broad
shallow
stream
beds
in
which
muddy
water
trickles
in
slender
currents
during
the
dry
seasons
while
when
it
rains
there
are
freshets
and
roaring
muddy
torrents
come
tearing
down
bringing
disaster
and
destruction
everywhere
moreover
these
floods
and
freshets
which
diversify
the
general
dryness
wash
away
from
the
mountain
sides
and
either
wash
away
or
cover
in
the
valleys
the
rich
fertile
soil
which
it
took
tens
of
thousands
of
years
for
nature
to
form
and
it
is
lost
forever
and
until
the
forests
grow
again
it
can
not
be
replaced
the
sand
and
stones
from
the
mountain
sides
are
washed
loose
and
come
rolling
down
to
cover
the
arable
lands
and
in
consequence
throughout
this
part
of
china
many
formerly
rich
districts
are
now
sandy
wastes
useless
for
human
cultivation
and
even
for
pasture
the
cities
have
been
of
course
seriously
affected
for
the
streams
have
gradually
ceased
to
be
navigable
there
is
testimony
that
even
within
the
memory
of
men
now
living
there
has
been
a
serious
diminution
of
the
rainfall
of
northeastern
china
the
level
of
the
sungari
river
in
northern
manchuria
has
been
sensibly
lowered
during
the
last
fifty
years
at
least
partly
as
the
result
of
the
indiscriminate
rutting
of
the
forests
forming
its
watershed
almost
all
the
rivers
of
northern
china
have
become
uncontrollable
and
very
dangerous
to
the
dwellers
along
their
banks
as
a
direct
result
of
the
destruction
of
the
forests
the
journey
from
pekin
to
jehol
shows
in
melancholy
fashion
how
the
soil
has
been
washed
away
from
whole
valleys
so
that
they
have
been
converted
into
deserts
in
northern
china
this
disastrous
process
has
gone
on
so
long
and
has
proceeded
so
far
that
no
complete
remedy
could
be
applied
there
are
certain
mountains
in
china
from
which
the
soil
is
gone
so
utterly
that
only
the
slow
action
of
the
ages
could
again
restore
it
although
of
course
much
could
be
done
to
prevent
the
still
further
eastward
extension
of
the
mongolian
desert
if
the
chinese
government
would
act
at
once
the
accompanying
cuts
from
photographs
show
the
inconceivable
desolation
of
the
barren
mountains
in
which
certain
of
these
rivers
risemountains
be
it
remembered
which
formerly
supported
dense
forests
of
larches
and
firs
now
unable
to
produce
any
wood
and
because
of
their
condition
a
source
of
danger
to
the
whole
country
the
photographs
also
show
the
same
rivers
after
they
have
passed
through
the
mountains
the
beds
having
become
broad
and
sandy
because
of
the
deforestation
of
the
mountains
one
of
the
photographs
shows
a
caravan
passing
through
a
valley
formerly
when
the
mountains
were
forested
it
was
thickly
peopled
by
prosperous
peasants
now
the
floods
have
carried
destruction
all
over
the
land
and
the
valley
is
a
stony
desert
another
photograph
shows
a
mountain
road
covered
with
the
stones
and
rocks
that
are
brought
down
in
the
rainy
season
from
the
mountains
which
have
already
been
deforested
by
human
hands
another
shows
a
pebbly
riverbed
in
south
ern
manchuria
where
what
was
once
a
great
stream
has
dried
up
owing
to
the
deforestation
in
the
mountains
only
some
scrub
wood
is
left
which
will
disappear
within
a
half
century
yet
another
shows
the
effect
of
one
of
the
washouts
destroying
an
arable
mountain
side
these
washouts
being
due
to
the
removal
of
all
vegetation
yet
in
this
photograph
the
foreground
shows
that
reforestation
is
still
a
possibility
in
places
what
has
thus
happened
in
northern
china
what
has
happened
in
central
asia
in
palestine
in
north
africa
in
parts
of
the
mediterranean
countries
of
europe
will
surely
happen
in
our
country
if
we
do
not
exercise
that
wise
forethought
which
should
be
one
of
the
chief
marks
of
any
people
calling
itself
civilized
nothing
should
be
permitted
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
preservation
of
the
forests
and
it
is
criminal
to
permit
individuals
to
purchase
a
little
gain
for
themselves
through
the
destruction
of
forests
when
this
destruction
is
fatal
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
whole
country
in
the
future
inland
waterways
action
should
be
begun
forthwith
during
the
present
session
of
the
congress
for
the
improvement
of
our
inland
waterwaysaction
which
will
result
in
giving
us
not
only
navigable
but
navigated
rivers
we
have
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
upon
these
waterways
yet
the
traffic
on
nearly
all
of
them
is
steadily
declining
this
condition
is
the
direct
result
of
the
absence
of
any
comprehensive
and
farseeing
plan
of
waterway
improvement
obviously
we
can
not
continue
thus
to
expend
the
revenues
of
the
government
without
return
it
is
poor
business
to
spend
money
for
inland
navigation
unless
we
get
it
inquiry
into
the
condition
of
the
mississippi
and
its
principal
tributaries
reveals
very
many
instances
of
the
utter
waste
caused
by
the
methods
which
have
hitherto
obtained
for
the
socalled
improvement
of
navigation
a
striking
instance
is
supplied
by
the
improvement
of
the
ohio
which
begun
in
was
continued
under
a
single
plan
for
half
a
century
in
a
new
plan
was
adopted
and
followed
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
still
a
different
plan
was
adopted
and
has
since
been
pursued
at
a
rate
which
only
promises
a
navigable
river
in
from
twenty
to
one
hundred
years
longer
such
shortsighted
vacillating
and
futile
methods
are
accompanied
by
decreasing
waterborne
commerce
and
increasing
traffic
congestion
on
land
by
increasing
floods
and
by
the
waste
of
public
money
the
remedy
lies
in
abandoning
the
methods
which
have
so
signally
failed
and
adopting
new
ones
in
keeping
with
the
needs
and
demands
of
our
people
in
a
report
on
a
measure
introduced
at
the
first
session
of
the
present
congress
the
secretary
of
war
said
the
chief
defect
in
the
methods
hitherto
pursued
lies
in
the
absence
of
executive
authority
for
originating
comprehensive
plans
covering
the
country
or
natural
divisions
thereof
in
this
opinion
i
heartily
concur
the
present
methods
not
only
fail
to
give
us
inland
navigation
but
they
are
injurious
to
the
army
as
well
what
is
virtually
a
permanent
detail
of
the
corps
of
engineers
to
civilian
duty
necessarily
impairs
the
efficiency
of
our
military
establishment
the
military
engineers
have
undoubtedly
done
efficient
work
in
actual
construction
but
they
are
necessarily
unsuited
by
their
training
and
traditions
to
take
the
broad
view
and
to
gather
and
transmit
to
the
congress
the
commercial
and
industrial
information
and
forecasts
upon
which
waterway
improvement
must
always
so
largely
rest
furthermore
they
have
failed
to
grasp
the
great
underlying
fact
that
every
stream
is
a
unit
from
its
source
to
its
mouth
and
that
all
its
uses
are
interdependent
prominent
officers
of
the
engineer
corps
have
recently
even
gone
so
far
as
to
assert
in
print
that
waterways
are
not
dependent
upon
the
conservation
of
the
forests
about
their
headwaters
this
position
is
opposed
to
all
the
recent
work
of
the
scientific
bureaus
of
the
government
and
to
the
general
experience
of
mankind
a
physician
who
disbelieved
in
vaccination
would
not
be
the
right
man
to
handle
an
epidemic
of
smallpox
nor
should
we
leave
a
doctor
skeptical
about
the
transmission
of
yellow
fever
by
the
stegomyia
mosquito
in
charge
of
sanitation
at
havana
or
panama
so
with
the
improvement
of
our
rivers
it
is
no
longer
wise
or
safe
to
leave
this
great
work
in
the
hands
of
men
who
fail
to
grasp
the
essential
relations
between
navigation
and
general
development
and
to
assimilate
and
use
the
central
facts
about
our
streams
until
the
work
of
river
improvement
is
undertaken
in
a
modern
way
it
can
not
have
results
that
will
meet
the
needs
of
this
modern
nation
these
needs
should
be
met
without
further
dillydallying
or
delay
the
plan
which
promises
the
best
and
quickest
results
is
that
of
a
permanent
commission
authorized
to
coordinate
the
work
of
all
the
government
departments
relating
to
waterways
and
to
frame
and
supervise
the
execution
of
a
comprehensive
plan
under
such
a
commission
the
actual
work
of
construction
might
be
entrusted
to
the
reclamation
service
or
to
the
military
engineers
acting
with
a
sufficient
number
of
civilians
to
continue
the
work
in
time
of
war
or
it
might
be
divided
between
the
reclamation
service
and
the
corps
of
engineers
funds
should
be
provided
from
current
revenues
if
it
is
deemed
wiseotherwise
from
the
sale
of
bonds
the
essential
thing
is
that
the
work
should
go
forward
under
the
best
possible
plan
and
with
the
least
possible
delay
we
should
have
a
new
type
of
work
and
a
new
organization
for
planning
and
directing
it
the
time
for
playing
with
our
waterways
is
past
the
country
demands

national
parks
i
urge
that
all
our
national
parks
adjacent
to
national
forests
be
placed
completely
under
the
control
of
the
forest
service
of
the
agricultural
department
instead
of
leaving
them
as
they
now
are
under
the
interior
department
and
policed
by
the
army
the
congress
should
provide
for
superintendents
with
adequate
corps
of
firstclass
civilian
scouts
or
rangers
and
further
place
the
road
construction
under
the
superintendent
instead
of
leaving
it
with
the
war
department
such
a
change
in
park
management
would
result
in
economy
and
avoid
the
difficulties
of
administration
which
now
arise
from
having
the
responsibility
of
care
and
protection
divided
between
different
departments
the
need
for
this
course
is
peculiarly
great
in
the
yellowstone
park
this
like
the
yosemite
is
a
great
wonderland
and
should
be
kept
as
a
national
playground
in
both
all
wild
things
should
be
protected
and
the
scenery
kept
wholly
unmarred
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
have
been
able
to
set
aside
in
various
parts
of
the
country
small
wellchosen
tracts
of
ground
to
serve
as
sanctuaries
and
nurseries
for
wild
creatures
denatured
alcohol
i
had
occasion
in
my
message
of
may
to
urge
the
passage
of
some
law
putting
alcohol
used
in
the
arts
industries
and
manufactures
upon
the
free
listthat
is
to
provide
for
the
withdrawal
free
of
tax
of
alcohol
which
is
to
be
denatured
for
those
purposes
the
law
of
june
and
its
amendment
of
march
accomplished
what
was
desired
in
that
respect
and
the
use
of
denatured
alcohol
as
intended
is
making
a
fair
degree
of
progress
and
is
entitled
to
further
encouragement
and
support
from
the
congress
pure
food
the
pure
food
legislation
has
already
worked
a
benefit
difficult
to
overestimate
indian
service
it
has
been
my
purpose
from
the
beginning
of
my
administration
to
take
the
indian
service
completely
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
political
activity
and
there
has
been
steady
progress
toward
that
end
the
last
remaining
stronghold
of
politics
in
that
service
was
the
agency
system
which
had
seen
its
best
days
and
was
gradually
falling
to
pieces
from
natural
or
purely
evolutionary
causes
but
like
all
such
survivals
was
decaying
slowly
in
its
later
stages
it
seems
clear
that
its
extinction
had
better
be
made
final
now
so
that
the
ground
can
be
cleared
for
larger
constructive
work
on
behalf
of
the
indians
preparatory
to
their
induction
into
the
full
measure
of
responsible
citizenship
on
november
only
eighteen
agencies
were
left
on
the
roster
with
two
exceptions
where
some
legal
questions
seemed
to
stand
temporarily
in
the
way
these
have
been
changed
to
superintendencies
and
their
heads
brought
into
the
classified
civil
service
secret
service
last
year
an
amendment
was
incorporated
in
the
measure
providing
for
the
secret
service
which
provided
that
there
should
be
no
detail
from
the
secret
service
and
no
transfer
therefrom
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
this
amendment
has
been
of
benefit
only
and
could
be
of
benefit
only
to
the
criminal
classes
if
deliberately
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
diminishing
the
effectiveness
of
war
against
crime
it
could
not
have
been
better
devised
to
this
end
it
forbade
the
practices
that
had
been
followed
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
by
the
executive
heads
of
various
departments
for
twenty
years
to
these
practices
we
owe
the
securing
of
the
evidence
which
enabled
us
to
drive
great
lotteries
out
of
business
and
secure
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
dollars
in
fines
from
their
promoters
these
practices
have
enabled
us
to
get
some
of
the
evidence
indispensable
in
order
in
connection
with
the
theft
of
government
land
and
government
timber
by
great
corporations
and
by
individuals
these
practices
have
enabled
us
to
get
some
of
the
evidence
indispensable
in
order
to
secure
the
conviction
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
formidable
criminals
with
whom
the
government
has
to
deal
both
those
operating
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
and
others
the
amendment
in
question
was
of
benefit
to
no
one
excepting
to
these
criminals
and
it
seriously
hampers
the
government
in
the
detection
of
crime
and
the
securing
of
justice
moreover
it
not
only
affects
departments
outside
of
the
treasury
but
it
tends
to
hamper
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
himself
in
the
effort
to
utilize
the
employees
of
his
department
so
as
to
best
meet
the
requirements
of
the
public
service
it
forbids
him
from
preventing
frauds
upon
the
customs
service
from
investigating
irregularities
in
branch
mints
and

assay
offices
and
has
seriously
crippled
him
it
prevents
the
promotion
of
employees
in
the
secret
service
and
this
further
discourages
good
effort
in
its
present
form
the
restriction
operates
only
to
the
advantage
of
the
criminal
of
the
wrongdoer
the
chief
argument
in
favor
of
the
provision
was
that
the
congressmen
did
not
themselves
wish
to
be
investigated
by
secret
service
men
very
little
of
such
investigation
has
been
done
in
the
past
but
it
is
true
that
the
work
of
the
secret
service
agents
was
partly
responsible
for
the
indictment
and
conviction
of
a
senator
and
a
congressman
for
land
frauds
in
oregon
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
protect
criminally
in
any
branch
of
the
public
service
and
exactly
as
we
have
again
and
again
during
the
past
seven
years
prosecuted
and
convicted
such
criminals
who
were
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
so
in
my
belief
we
should
be
given
ample
means
to
prosecute
them
if
found
in
the
legislative
branch
but
if
this
is
not
considered
desirable
a
special
exception
could
be
made
in
the
law
prohibiting
the
use
of
the
secret
service
force
in
investigating
members
of
the
congress
it
would
be
far
better
to
do
this
than
to
do
what
actually
was
done
and
strive
to
prevent
or
at
least
to
hamper
effective
action
against
criminals
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
postal
savings
banks
i
again
renew
my
recommendation
for
postal
savings
hanks
for
depositing
savings
with
the
security
of
the
government
behind
them
the
object
is
to
encourage
thrift
and
economy
in
the
wageearner
and
person
of
moderate
means
in
states
the
deposits
in
savings
banks
as
reported
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
amount
to
or
per
cent
of
the
entire
deposits
while
in
the
remaining
states
there
are
only
or
per
cent
showing
conclusively
that
there
are
many
localities
in
the
united
states
where
sufficient
opportunity
is
not
given
to
the
people
to
deposit
their
savings
the
result
is
that
money
is
kept
in
hiding
and
unemployed
it
is
believed
that
in
the
aggregate
vast
sums
of
money
would
be
brought
into
circulation
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
postal
savings
banks
while
there
are
only
savings
banks
reporting
to
the
comptroller
there
are
more
than
postoffices
of
which
are
money
order
offices
postal
savings
banks
are
now
in
operation
in
practically
all
of
the
great
civilized
countries
with
the
exception
of
the
united
states
parcel
post
in
my
last
annual
message
i
commended
the
postmastergenerals
recommendation
for
an
extension
of
the
parcel
post
on
the
rural
routes
the
establishment
of
a
local
parcel
post
on
rural
routes
would
be
to
the
mutual
benefit
of
the
farmer
and
the
country
storekeeper
and
it
is
desirable
that
the
routes
serving
more
than
people
should
be
utilized
to
the
fullest
practicable
extent
an
amendment
was
proposed
in
the
senate
at
the
last
session
at
the
suggestion
of
the
postmastergeneral
providing
that
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
practicability
of
establishing
a
special
local
parcel
post
system
on
the
rural
routes
throughout
the
united
states
the
postmastergeneral
be
authorized
and
directed
to
experiment
and
report
to
the
congress
the
result
of
such
experiment
by
establishing
a
special
local
parcel
post
system
on
rural
delivery
routes
in
not
to
exceed
four
counties
in
the
united
states
for
packages
of
fourthclass
matter
originating
on
a
rural
route
or
at
the
distributing
post
office
for
delivery
by
rural
carriers
it
would
seem
only
proper
that
such
an
experiment
should
be
tried
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
practicability
of
the
proposition
especially
as
the
postmastergeneral
estimates
that
the
revenue
derived
from
the
operation
of
such
a
system
on
all
the
rural
routes
would
amount
to
many
million
dollars
education
the
share
that
the
national
government
should
take
in
the
broad
work
of
education
has
not
received
the
attention
and
the
care
it
rightly
deserves
the
immediate
responsibility
for
the
support
and
improvement
of
our
educational
systems
and
institutions
rests
and
should
always
rest
with
the
people
of
the
several
states
acting
through
their
state
and
local
governments
but
the
nation
has
an
opportunity
in
educational
work
which
must
not
be
lost
and
a
duty
which
should
no
longer
be
neglected
the
national
bureau
of
education
was
established
more
than
forty
years
ago
its
purpose
is
to
collect
and
diffuse
such
information
as
shall
aid
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
efficient
school
systems
and
otherwise
promote
the
cause
of
education
throughout
the
country
this
purpose
in
no
way
conflicts
with
the
educational
work
of
the
states
but
may
be
made
of
great
advantage
to
the
states
by
giving
them
the
fullest
most
accurate
and
hence
the
most
helpful
information
and
suggestion
regarding
the
best
educational
systems
the
nation
through
its
broader
field
of
activities
its
wider
opportunity
for
obtaining
information
from
all
the
states
and
from
foreign
countries
is
able
to
do
that
which
not
even
the
richest
states
can
do
and
with
the
distinct
additional
advantage
that
the
information
thus
obtained
is
used
for
the
immediate
benefit
of
all
our
people
with
the
limited
means
hitherto
provided
the
bureau
of
education
has
rendered
efficient
service
but
the
congress
has
neglected
to
adequately
supply
the
bureau
with
means
to
meet
the
educational
growth
of
the
country
the
appropriations
for
the
general
work
of
the
bureau
outside
education
in
alaska
for
the
year
are
but
an
amount
less
than
they
were
ten
years
ago
and
some
of
the
important
items
in
these
appropriations
are
less
than
they
were
thirty
years
ago
it
is
an
inexcusable
waste
of
public
money
to
appropriate
an
amount
which
is
so
inadequate
as
to
make
it
impossible
properly
to
do
the
work
authorized
and
it
is
unfair
to
the
great
educational
interests
of
the
country
to
deprive
them
of
the
value
of
the
results
which
can
be
obtained
by
proper
appropriations
i
earnestly
recommend
that
this
unfortunate
state
of
affairs
as
regards
the
national
educational
office
be
remedied
by
adequate
appropriations
this
recommendation
is
urged
by
the
representatives
of
our
common
schools
and
great
state
universities
and
the
leading
educators
who
all
unite
in
requesting
favorable
consideration
and
action
by
the
congress
upon
this
subject
census
i
strongly
urge
that
the
request
of
the
director
of
the
census
in
connection
with
the
decennial
work
so
soon
to
be
begun
be
complied
with
and
that
the
appointments
to
the
census
force
be
placed
under
the
civil
service
law
waiving
the
geographical
requirements
as
requested
by
the
director
of
the
census
the
supervisors
and
enumerators
should
not
be
appointed
under
the
civil
service
law
for
the
reasons
given
by
the
director
i
commend
to
the
congress
the
careful
consideration
of
the
admirable
report
of
the
director
of
the
census
and
i
trust
that
his
recommendations
will
be
adopted
and
immediate
action
thereon
taken
public
health
it
is
highly
advisable
that
there
should
be
intelligent
action
on
the
part
of
the
nation
on
the
question
of
preserving
the
health
of
the
country
through
the
practical
extermination
in
san
francisco
of
diseasebearing
rodents
our
country
has
thus
far
escaped
the
bubonic
plague
this
is
but
one
of
the
many
achievements
of
american
health
officers
and
it
shows
what
can
be
accomplished
with
a
better
organization
than
at
present
exists
the
dangers
to
public
health
from
food
adulteration
and
from
many
other
sources
such
as
the
menace
to
the
physical
mental
and
moral
development
of
children
from
child
labor
should
be
met
and
overcome
there
are
numerous
diseases
which
are
now
known
to
be
preventable
which
are
nevertheless
not
prevented
the
recent
international
congress
on
tuberculosis
has
made
us
painfully
aware
of
the
inadequacy
of
american
public
health
legislation
this
nation
can
not
afford
to
lag
behind
in
the
worldwide
battle
now
being
waged
by
all
civilized
people
with
the
microscopic
foes
of
mankind
nor
ought
we
longer
to
ignore
the
reproach
that
this
government
takes
more
pains
to
protect
the
lives
of
hogs
and
of
cattle
than
of
human
beings
redistribution
of
bureaus
the
first
legislative
step
to
be
taken
is
that
for
the
concentration
of
the
proper
bureaus
into
one
of
the
existing
departments
i
therefore
urgently
recommend
the
passage
of
a
bill
which
shall
authorize
a
redistribution
of
the
bureaus
which
shall
best
accomplish
this
end
government
printing
office
i
recommend
that
legislation
be
enacted
placing
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
the
government
printing
office
at
present
this
office
is
under
the
combined
control
supervision
and
administrative
direction
of
the
president
and
of
the
joint
committee
on
printing
of
the
two
houses
of
the
congress
the
advantage
of
having
the
employees
in
this
office
and
the
expenditure
of
the
appropriated
therefor
supervised
by
an
executive
department
is
obvious
instead
of
the
present
combined
supervision
soldiers
homes
all
soldiers
homes
should
be
placed
under
the
complete
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
war
department
independent
bureaus
and
commissions
economy
and
sound
business
policy
require
that
all
existing
independent
bureaus
and
commissions
should
be
placed
under
the
jurisdiction
of
appropriate
executive
departments
it
is
unwise
from
every
standpoint
and
results
only
in
mischief
to
have
any
executive
work
done
save
by
the
purely
executive
bodies
under
the
control
of
the
president
and
each
such
executive
body
should
be
under
the
immediate
supervision
of
a
cabinet
minister
statehood
i
advocate
the
immediate
admission
of
new
mexico
and
arizona
as
states
this
should
be
done
at
the
present
session
of
the
congress
the
people
of
the
two
territories
have
made
it
evident
by
their
votes
that
they
will
not
come
in
as
one
state
the
only
alternative
is
to
admit
them
as
two
and
i
trust
that
this
will
be
done
without
delay
interstate
fisheries
i
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
importance
of
the
problem
of
the
fisheries
in
the
interstate
waters
on
the
great
lakes
we
are

now
under
the
very
wise
treaty
of
april
th
of
this
year
endeavoring
to
come
to
an
international
agreement
for
the
preservation
and
satisfactory
use
of
the
fisheries
of
these
waters
which
can
not
otherwise
be
achieved
lake
erie
for
example
has
the
richest
fresh
water
fisheries
in
the
world
but
it
is
now
controlled
by
the
statutes
of
two
nations
four
states
and
one
province
and
in
this
province
by
different
ordinances
in
different
counties
all
these
political
divisions
work
at
cross
purposes
and
in
no
case
can
they
achieve
protection
to
the
fisheries
on
the
one
hand
and
justice
to
the
localities
and
individuals
on
the
other
the
case
is
similar
in
puget
sound
but
the
problem
is
quite
as
pressing
in
the
interstate
waters
of
the
united
states
the
salmon
fisheries
of
the
columbia
river
are
now
but
a
fraction
of
what
they
were
twentyfive
years
ago
and
what
they
would
be
now
if
the
united
states
government
had
taken
complete
charge
of
them
by
intervening
between
oregon
and
washington
during
these
twentyfive
years
the
fishermen
of
each
state
have
naturally
tried
to
take
all
they
could
get
and
the
two
legislatures
have
never
been
able
to
agree
on
joint
action
of
any
kind
adequate
in
degree
for
the
protection
of
the
fisheries
at
the
moment
the
fishing
on
the
oregon
side
is
practically
closed
while
there
is
no
limit
on
the
washington
side
of
any
kind
and
no
one
can
tell
what
the
courts
will
decide
as
to
the
very
statutes
under
which
this
action
and
nonaction
result
meanwhile
very
few
salmon
reach
the
spawning
grounds
and
probably
four
years
hence
the
fisheries
will
amount
to
nothing
and
this
comes
from
a
struggle
between
the
associated
or
gillnet
fishermen
on
the
one
hand
and
the
owners
of
the
fishing
wheels
up
the
river
the
fisheries
of
the
mississippi
the
ohio
and
the
potomac
are
also
in
a
bad
way
for
this
there
is
no
remedy
except
for
the
united
states
to
control
and
legislate
for
the
interstate
fisheries
as
part
of
the
business
of
interstate
commerce
in
this
case
the
machinery
for
scientific
investigation
and
for
control
already
exists
in
the
united
states
bureau
of
fisheries
in
this
as
in
similar
problems
the
obvious
and
simple
rule
should
be
followed
of
having
those
matters
which
no
particular
state
can
manage
taken
in
hand
by
the
united
states
problems
which
in
the
seesaw
of
conflicting
state
legislatures
are
absolutely
unsolvable
are
easy
enough
for
congress
to
control
fisheries
and
fur
seals
the
federal
statute
regulating
interstate
traffic
in
game
should
be
extended
to
include
fish
new
federal

hatcheries

be
established
the

foreign

this

foreign

is
based
on
the
theory
that
right
must
be
done
between
nations
precisely
as
between
individuals
and
in
our
actions
for
the
last
ten
years
we
have
in
this
matter
proven
our
faith
by
our

have
behaved

latinamerican
republics
the
commercial
and
material
progress
of
the
twenty
latinamerican
republics
is
worthy
of
the
careful
attention
of
the
congress
no
other
section
of
the
world
has
shown
a
greater
proportionate
development
of
its
foreign
trade
during
the
last
ten
years
and
none
other
has
more
special
claims
on
the
interest
of
the
united
states
it
offers
today
probably
larger
opportunities
for
the
legitimate
expansion
of
our
commerce
than
any
other
group
of
countries
these
countries
will
want
our
products
in
greatly
increased
quantities
and
we
shall
correspondingly
need
theirs
the
international
bureau
of
the
american
republics
is
doing
a
useful
work
in
making
these
nations
and
their
resources
better
known
to
us
and
in
acquainting
them
not
only
with
us
as
a
people
and
with
our
purposes
towards
them
but
with
what
we
have
to
exchange
for
their
goods
it
is
an
international
institution
supported
by
all
the
governments
of
the

panama

the
work
on
the
panama
canal
is
being
done
with
a
speed
efficiency
and
entire
devotion
to
duty
which
make
it
a
model
for
all
work
of
the
kind
no
task
of
such
magnitude
has
ever
before
been
undertaken
by
any
nation
and
no
task
of
the
kind
has
ever
been
better
performed
the

isthmus
from
colonel
goethals
and
his
fellow
commissioners
through
the
entire
list
of

who
are
faithfully
doing

have
won
their
right
to
the
ungrudging

of

ocean
mail
liners
i
again
recommend
the
extension
of
the
ocean
mail
act
of
so
that
satisfactory
american
ocean
mail
lines
to
south
america
asia
the
philippines
and
australasia
may
be
established
the
creation
of
such
steamship
lines
should
be
the
natural
corollary
of
the
voyage
of
the
battle
fleet
it
should
precede
the
opening
of
the
panama
canal
even
under
favorable
conditions
several
years
must
elapse
before
such
lines
can
be
put
into
operation
accordingly
i
urge
that
the
congress
act
promptly
where
foresight
already
shows
that
action
sooner
or
later
will
be
inevitable
hawaii
i
call
particular
attention
to
the
territory
of
hawaii
the
importance
of
those
islands
is
apparent
and
the
need
of
improving
their
condition
and
developing
their
resources
is
urgent
in
recent
years
industrial
conditions
upon
the
islands
have
radically
changed
the
importation
of
coolie
labor
has
practically
ceased
and
there
is
now
developing
such
a
diversity
in
agricultural
products
as
to
make
possible
a
change
in
the
land
conditions
of
the
territory
so
that
an
opportunity
may
be
given
to
the
small
land
owner
similar
to
that
on
the
mainland
to
aid
these
changes
the
national
government
must
provide
the
necessary
harbor
improvements
on
each
island
so
that
the
agricultural
products
can
be
carried
to
the
markets
of
the
world
the
coastwise
shipping
laws
should
be
amended
to
meet
the
special
needs
of
the
islands
and
the
alien
contract
labor
law
should
be
so
modified
in
its
application
to
hawaii
as
to
enable
american
and
european
labor
to
be
brought
thither
we
have
begun
to
improve
pearl
harbor
for
a
naval
base
and
to
provide
the
necessary
military
fortifications
for
the
protection
of
the
islands
but
i
can
not
too
strongly
emphasize
the
need
of
appropriations
for
these
purposes
of
such
an
amount
as
will
within
the
shortest
possible
time
make
those
islands
practically
impregnable
it
is
useless
to
develop
the
industrial
conditions
of
the
islands
and
establish
there
bases
of
supply
for
our
naval
and
merchant
fleets
unless
we
insure
as
far
as
human
ingenuity
can
their
safety
from
foreign
seizure
one
thing
to
be
remembered
with
all
our
fortifications
is
that
it
is
almost
useless
to
make
them
impregnable
from
the
sea
if
they
are
left
open
to
land
attack
this
is
true
even
of
our
own
coast
but
it
is
doubly
true
of
our
insular
possessions
in
hawaii
for
instance
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
establish
a
naval
station
unless
we
establish
it
behind
fortifications
so
strong
that
no
landing
force
can
take
them
save
by
regular
and
longcontinued
siege
operations
the
philippines
real
progress
toward
selfgovernment
is
being
made
in
the
philippine
islands
the
gathering
of
a
philippine
legislative
body
and
philippine
assembly
marks
a
process
absolutely
new
in
asia
not
only
as
regards
asiatic
colonies
of
european
powers
but
as
regards
asiatic
possessions
of
other
asiatic
powers
and
indeed
always
excepting
the
striking
and
wonderful
example
afforded
by
the
great
empire
of
japan
it
opens
an
entirely
new
departure
when
compared
with
anything
which
has
happened
among
asiatic
powers
which
are
their
own
masters
hitherto
this
philippine
legislature
has
acted
with
moderation
and
selfrestraint
and
has
seemed
in
practical
fashion
to
realize
the
eternal
truth
that
there
must
always
be
government
and
that
the
only
way
in
which
any
body
of
individuals
can
escape
the
necessity
of
being
governed
by
outsiders
is
to
show
that
they
are
able
to
restrain
themselves
to
keep
down
wrongdoing
and
disorder
the
filipino
people
through
their
officials
are
therefore
making
real
steps
in
the
direction
of
selfgovernment
i
hope
and
believe
that
these
steps
mark
the
beginning
of
a
course
which
will
continue
till
the
filipinos
become
fit
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
desire
to
be
an
independent
nation
but
it
is
well
for
them
and
well
also
for
those
americans
who
during
the
past
decade
have
done
so
much
damage
to
the
filipinos
by
agitation
for
an
immediate
independence
for
which
they
were
totally
unfit
to
remember
that
selfgovernment
depends
and
must
depend
upon
the
filipinos
themselves
all
we
can
do
is
to
give
them
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
capacity
for
selfgovernment
if
we
had
followed
the
advice
of
the
foolish
doctrinaires
who
wished
us
at
any
time
during
the
last
ten
years
to
turn
the
filipino
people
adrift
we
should
have
shirked
the
plainest
possible
duty
and
have
inflicted
a
lasting
wrong
upon
the
filipino
people
we
have
acted
in
exactly
the
opposite
spirit
we
have
given
the
filipinos
constitutional
governmenta
government
based
upon
justiceand
we
have
shown
that
we
have
governed
them
for
their
good
and
not
for
our
aggrandizement
at
the
present
time
as
during
the
past
ten
years
the
inexorable
logic
of
facts
shows
that
this
government
must
be
supplied
by
us
and
not
by
them
we
must
be
wise
and
generous
we
must
help
the
filipinos
to
master
the
difficult
art
of
selfcontrol
which
is
simply
another
name
for
selfgovernment
but
we
can
not
give
them
selfgovernment
save
in
the
sense
of
governing
them
so
that
gradually
they
may
if
they
are
able
learn
to
govern
themselves
under
the
present
system
of
just
laws
and
sympathetic
administration
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
are
gradually
acquiring
the
character
which
lies
at
the
basis
of
selfgovernment
and
for
which
if
it
be
lacking
no
system
of
laws
no
paper
constitution
will
in
any
wise
serve
as
a
substitute
our
people
in
the
philippines
have
achieved
what
may
legitimately
be
called
a
marvelous
success
in
giving
to
them
a
government

which
marks
on
the
part
of
those
in
authority
both
the
necessary
understanding
of
the
people
and
the
necessary
purpose
to
serve
them
disinterestedly
and
in
good
faith
i
trust
that
within
a
generation
the
time
will
arrive
when
the
philippines
can
decide
for
themselves
whether
it
is
well
for
them
to
become
independent
or
to
continue
under
the
protection
of
a
strong
and
disinterested
power
able
to
guarantee
to
the
islands
order
at
home
and
protection
from
foreign
invasion
but
no
one
can
prophesy
the
exact
date
when
it
will
be
wise
to
consider
independence
as
a
fixed
and
definite
policy
it
would
be
worse
than
folly
to
try
to
set
down
such
a
date
in
advance
for
it
must
depend
upon
the
way
in
which
the
philippine
people
themselves
develop
the
power
of
selfmastery
porto
rico
i
again
recommend
that
american
citizenship
be
conferred
upon
the
people
of
porto
rico
cuba
in
cuba
our
occupancy
will
cease
in
about
two
months
time
the
cubans
have
in
orderly
manner
elected
their
own
governmental
authorities
and
the
island
will
be
turned
over
to
them
our
occupation
on
this
occasion
has
lasted
a
little
over
two
years
and
cuba
has
thriven
and
prospered
under
it
our
earnest
hope
and
one
desire
is
that
the
people
of
the
island
shall
now
govern
themselves
with
justice
so
that
peace
and
order
may
be
secure
we
will
gladly
help
them
to
this
end
but
i
would
solemnly
warn
them
to
remember
the
great
truth
that
the
only
way
a
people
can
permanently
avoid
being
governed
from
without
is
to
show
that
they
both
can
and
will
govern
themselves
from
within
japanese
exposition
the
japanese
government
has
postponed
until
the
date
of
the
great
international
exposition
the
action
being
taken
so
as
to
insure
ample
time
in
which
to
prepare
to
make
the
exposition
all
that
it
should
be
made
the
american
commissioners
have
visited
japan
and
the
postponement
will
merely
give
ampler
opportunity
for
america
to
be
represented
at
the
exposition
not
since
the
first
international
exposition
has
there
been
one
of
greater
importance
than
this
will
be
marking
as
it
does
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
ascension
to
the
throne
of
the
emperor
of
japan
the
extraordinary
leap
to
a
foremost
place
among
the
nations
of
the
world
made
by
japan
during
this
half
century
is
something
unparalleled
in
all
previous
history
this
exposition
will
fitly
commemorate
and
signalize
the
giant
progress
that
has
been
achieved
it
is
the
first
exposition
of
its
kind
that
has
ever
been
held
in
asia
the
united
states
because
of
the
ancient
friendship
between
the
two
peoples
because
each
of
us
fronts
on
the
pacific
and
because
of
the
growing
commercial
relations
between
this
country
and
asia
takes
a
peculiar
interest
in
seeing
the
exposition
made
a
success
in
every
way
i
take
this
opportunity
publicly
to
state
my
appreciation
of
the
way
in
which
in
japan
in
australia
in
new
zealand
and
in
all
the
states
of
south
america
the
battle
fleet
has
been
received
on
its
practice
voyage
around
the
world
the
american
government
can
not
too
strongly
express
its
appreciation
of
the
abounding
and
generous
hospitality
shown
our
ships
in
every
port
they
visited
the
army
as
regards
the
army
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
while
our
junior
officers
and
enlisted
men
stand
very
high
the
present
system
of
promotion
by
seniority
results
in
bringing
into
the
higher
grades
many
men
of
mediocre
capacity
who
have
but
a
short
time
to
serve
no
man
should
regard
it
as
his
vested
right
to
rise
to
the
highest
rank
in
the
army
any
more
than
in
any
other
profession
it
is
a
curious
and
by
no
means
creditable
fact
that
there
should
be
so
often
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
public
and
its
representatives
to
understand
the
great
need
from
the
standpoint
of
the
service
and
the
nation
of
refusing
to
promote
respectable
elderly
incompetents
the
higher
places
should
be
given
to
the
most
deserving
men
without
regard
to
seniority
at
least
seniority
should
be
treated
as
only
one
consideration
in
the
stress
of
modern
industrial
competition
no
business
firm
could
succeed
if
those
responsible
for
its
management
were
chosen
simply
on
the
ground
that
they
were
the
oldest
people
in
its
employment
yet
this
is
the
course
advocated
as
regards
the
army
and
required
by
law
for
all
grades
except
those
of
general
officer
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
of
the
best
officers
in
the
highest
ranks
of
the
army
are
those
who
have
attained
their
present
position
wholly
or
in
part
by
a
process
of
selection
the
scope
of
retiring
boards
should
be
extended
so
that
they
could
consider
general
unfitness
to
command
for
any
cause
in
order
to
secure
a
far
more
rigid
enforcement
than
at
present
in
the
elimination
of
officers
for
mental
physical
or
temperamental
disabilities
but
this
plan
is
recommended
only
if
the
congress
does
not
see
fit
to
provide
what
in
my
judgment
is
far
better
that
is
for
selection
in
promotion
and
for
elimination
for
age
officers
who
fail
to
attain
a
certain
rank
by
a
certain
age
should
be
retiredfor
instance
if
a
man
should
not
attain
field
rank
by
the
time
he
is
he
should
of
course
be
placed
on
the
retired
list
general
officers
should
be
selected
as
at
present
and
onethird
of
the
other
promotions
should
be
made
by
selection
the
selection
to
be
made
by
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
war
from
a
list
of
at
least
two
candidates
proposed
for
each
vacancy
by
a
board
of
officers
from
the
arm
of
the
service
from
which
the
promotion
is
to
be
made
a
bill
is
now
before
the
congress
having
for
its
object
to
secure
the
promotion
of
officers
to
various
grades
at
reasonable
ages
through
a
process
of
selection
by
boards
of
officers
of
the
least
efficient
for
retirement
with
a
percentage
of
their
pay
depending
upon
length
of
service
the
bill
although
not
accomplishing
all
that
should
be
done
is
a
long
step
in
the
right
direction
and
i
earnestly
recommend
its
passage
or
that
of
a
more
completely
effective
measure
the
cavalry
arm
should
be
reorganized
upon
modern
lines
this
is
an
arm
in
which
it
is
peculiarly
necessary
that
the
field
officers
should
not
be
old
the
cavalry
is
much
more
difficult
to
form
than
infantry
and
it
should
be
kept
up
to
the
maximum
both
in
efficiency
and
in
strength
for
it
can
not
be
made
in
a
hurry
at
present
both
infantry
and
artillery
are
too
few
in
number
for
our
needs
especial
attention
should
be
paid
to
development
of
the
machine
gun
a
general
service
corps
should
be
established
as
things
are
now
the
average
soldier
has
far
too
much
labor
of
a
nonmilitary
character
to
perform
national
guard
now
that
the
organized
militia
the
national
guard
has
been
incorporated
with
the
army
as
a
part
of
the
national
forces
it
behooves
the
government
to
do
every
reasonable
thing
in
its
power
to
perfect
its
efficiency
it
should
be
assisted
in
its
instruction
and
otherwise
aided
more
liberally
than
heretofore
the
continuous
services
of
many
welltrained
regular
officers
will
be
essential
in
this
connection
such
officers
must
be
specially
trained
at
service
schools
best
to
qualify
them
as
instructors
of
the
national
guard
but
the
detailing
of
officers
for
training
at
the
service
schools
and
for
duty
with
the
national
guard
entails
detaching
them
from
their
regiments
which
are
already
greatly
depleted
by
detachment
of
officers
for
assignment
to
duties
prescribed
by
acts
of
the
congress
a
bill
is
now
pending
before
the
congress
creating
a
number
of
extra
officers
in
the
army
which
if
passed
as
it
ought
to
be
will
enable
more
officers
to
be
trained
as
instructors
of
the
national
guard
and
assigned
to
that
duty
in
case
of
war
it
will
be
of
the
utmost
importance
to
have
a
large
number
of
trained
officers
to
use
for
turning
raw
levies
into
good
troops
there
should
be
legislation
to
provide
a
complete
plan
for
organizing
the
great
body
of
volunteers
behind
the
regular
army
and
national
guard
when
war
has
come
congressional
assistance
should
be
given
those
who
are
endeavoring
to
promote
rifle
practice
so
that
our
men
in
the
services
or
out
of
them
may
know
how
to
use
the
rifle
while
teams
representing
the
united
states
won
the
rifle
and
revolver
championships
of
the
world
against
all
comers
in
england
this
year
it
is
unfortunately
true
that
the
great
body
of
our
citizens
shoot
less
and
less
as
time
goes
on
to
meet
this
we
should
encourage
rifle
practice
among
schoolboys
and
indeed
among
all
classes
as
well
as
in
the
military
services
by
every
means
in
our
power
thus
and
not
otherwise
may
we
be
able
to
assist
in
preserving
the
peace
of
the
world
fit
to
hold
our
own
against
the
strong
nations
of
the
earth
our
voice
for
peace
will
carry
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
unprepared
and
therefore
unfit
we
must
sit
dumb
and
helpless
to
defend
ourselves
protect
others
or
preserve
peace
the
first
stepin
the
direction
of
preparation
to
avert
war
if
possible
and
to
be
fit
for
war
if
it
should
comeis
to
teach
our
men
to
shoot
the
navy
i
approve
the
recommendations
of
the
general
board
for
the
increase
of
the
navy
calling
especial
attention
to
the
need
of
additional
destroyers
and
colliers
and
above
all
of
the
four
battleships
it
is
desirable
to
complete
as
soon
as
possible
a
squadron
of
eight
battleships
of
the
best
existing
type
the
north
dakota
delaware
florida
and
utah
will
form
the
first
division
of
this
squadron
the
four
vessels
proposed
will
form
the
second
division
it
will
be
an
improvement
on
the
first
the
ships
being
of
the
heavy
single
caliber
all
big
gun
type
all
the
vessels
should
have
the
same
tactical
qualitiesthat
is
speed
and
turning
circleand
as
near
as
possible
these
tactical
qualities
should
be
the
same
as
in
the
four
vessels
before
named
now
being
built
i
most
earnestly
recommend
that
the
general
board
be
by
law
turned
into
a
general
staff
there
is
literally
no
excuse
whatever
for
continuing
the
present
bureau
organization
of
the
navy
the
navy
should
be
treated
as
a
purely
military
organization
and
everything
should
be
subordinated
to
the
one
object
of
securing
military
efficiency
such
military
efficiency
can
only
be
guaranteed
in
time
of
war
if
there
is
the

most
thorough
previous
preparation
in
time
of
peacea
preparation
i
may
add
which
will
in
all
probability
prevent
any
need
of
war
the
secretary
must
be
supreme
and
he
should
have
as
his
official
advisers
a
body
of
line
officers
who
should
themselves
have
the
power
to
pass
upon
and
coordinate
all
the
work
and
all
the
proposals
of
the
several
bureaus
a
system
of
promotion
by
merit
either
by
selection
or
by
exclusion
or
by
both
processes
should
be
introduced
it
is
out
of
the
question
if
the
present
principle
of
promotion
by
mere
seniority
is
kept
to
expect
to
get
the
best
results
from
the
higher
officers
our
men
come
too
old
and
stay
for
too
short
a
time
in
the
high
command
positions
two
hospital
ships
should
be
provided
the
actual
experience
of
the
hospital
ship
with
the
fleet
in
the
pacific
has
shown
the
invaluable
work
which
such
a
ship
does
and
has
also
proved
that
it
is
well
to
have
it
kept
under
the
command
of
a
medical
officer
as
was
to
be
expected
all
of
the
anticipations
of
trouble
from
such
a
command
have
proved
completely
baseless
it
is
as
absurd
to
put
a
hospital
ship
under
a
line
officer
as
it
would
be
to
put
a
hospital
on
shore
under
such
a
command
this
ought
to
have
been
realized
before
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
failure
to
realize
it
now
nothing
better
for
the
navy
from
every
standpoint
has
ever
occurred
than
the
cruise
of
the
battle
fleet
around
the
world
the
improvement
of
the
ships
in
every
way
has
been
extraordinary
and
they
have
gained
far
more
experience
in
battle
tactics
than
they
would
have
gained
if
they
had
stayed
in
the
atlantic
waters
the
american
people
have
cause
for
profound
gratification
both
in
view
of
the
excellent
condition
of
the
fleet
as
shown
by
this
cruise
and
in
view
of
the
improvement
the
cruise
has
worked
in
this
already
high
condition
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
other
service
in
the
world
in
which
the
average
of
character
and
efficiency
in
the
enlisted
men
is
as
high
as
is
now
the
case
in
our
own
i
believe
that
the
same
statement
can
be
made
as
to
our
officers
taken
as
a
whole
but
there
must
be
a
reservation
made
in
regard
to
those
in
the
highest
ranksas
to
which
i
have
already
spokenand
in
regard
to
those
who
have
just
entered
the
service
because
we
do
not
now
get
full
benefit
from
our
excellent
naval
school
at
annapolis
it
is
absurd
not
to
graduate
the
midshipmen
as
ensigns
to
keep
them
for
two
years
in
such
an
anomalous
position
as
at
present
the
law
requires
is
detrimental
to
them
and
to
the
service
in
the
academy
itself
every
first
classman
should
be
required
in
turn
to
serve
as
petty
officer
and
officer
his
ability
to
discharge
his
duties
as
such
should
be
a
prerequisite
to
his
going
into
the
line
and
his
success
in
commanding
should
largely
determine
his
standing
at
graduation
the
board
of
visitors
should
be
appointed
in
january
and
each
member
should
be
required
to
give
at
least
six
days
service
only
from
one
to
three
days
to
be
performed
during
june
week
which
is
the
least
desirable
time
for
the
board
to
be
at
annapolis
so
far
as
benefiting
the
navy
by
their
observations
is
concerned
the
white
house
tuesday
december

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
no
nation
has
greater
resources
than
ours
and
i
think
it
can
be
truthfully
said
that
the
citizens
of
no
nation
possess
greater
energy
and
industrial
ability
in
no
nation
are
the
fundamental
business
conditions
sounder
than
in
ours
at
this
very
moment
and
it
is
foolish
when
such
is
the
case
for
people
to
hoard
money
instead
of
keeping
it
in
sound
banks
for
it
is
such
hoarding
that
is
the
immediate
occasion
of
money
stringency
moreover
as
a
rule
the
business
of
our
people
is
conducted
with
honesty
and
probity
and
this
applies
alike
to
farms
and
factories
to
railroads
and
banks
to
all
our
legitimate
commercial
enterprises
in
any
large
body
of
men
however
there
are
certain
to
be
some
who
are
dishonest
and
if
the
conditions
are
such
that
these
men
prosper
or
commit
their
misdeeds
with
impunity
their
example
is
a
very
evil
thing
for
the
community
where
these
men
are
business
men
of
great
sagacity
and
of
temperament
both
unscrupulous
and
reckless
and
where
the
conditions
are
such
that
they
act
without
supervision
or
control
and
at
first
without
effective
check
from
public
opinion
they
delude
many
innocent
people
into
making
investments
or
embarking
in
kinds
of
business
that
are
really
unsound
when
the
misdeeds
of
these
successfully
dishonest
men
are
discovered
suffering
comes
not
only
upon
them
but
upon
the
innocent
men
whom
they
have
misled
it
is
a
painful
awakening
whenever
it
occurs
and
naturally
when
it
does
occur
those
who
suffer
are
apt
to
forget
that
the
longer
it
was
deferred
the
more
painful
it
would
be
in
the
effort
to
punish
the
guilty
it
is
both
wise
and
proper
to
endeavor
so
far
as
possible
to
minimize
the
distress
of
those
who
have
been
misled
by
the
guilty
yet
it
is
not
possible
to
refrain
because
of
such
distress
from
striving
to
put
an
end
to
the
misdeeds
that
are
the
ultimate
causes
of
the
suffering
and
as
a
means
to
this
end
where
possible
to
punish
those
responsible
for
them
there
may
be
honest
differences
of
opinion
as
to
many
governmental
policies
but
surely
there
can
be
no
such
differences
as
to
the
need
of
unflinching
perseverance
in
the
war
against
successful
dishonesty
in
my
message
to
the
congress
on
december
i
said
if
the
folly
of
man
mars
the
general
wellbeing
then
those
who
are
innocent
of
the
folly
will
have
to
pay
part
of
the
penalty
incurred
by
those
who
are
guilty
of
the
folly
a
panic
brought
on
by
the
speculative
folly
of
part
of
the
business
community
would
hurt
the
whole
business
community
but
such
stoppage
of
welfare
though
it
might
be
severe
would
not
be
lasting
in
the
long
run
the
one
vital
factor
in
the
permanent
prosperity
of
the
country
is
the
high
individual
character
of
the
average
american
worker
the
average
american
citizen
no
matter
whether
his
work
be
mental
or
manual
whether
he
be
farmer
or
wageworker
business
man
or
professional
man
in
our
industrial
and
social
system
the
interests
of
all
men
are
so
closely
intertwined
that
in
the
immense
majority
of
cases
a
straightdealing
man
who
by
his
efficiency
by
his
ingenuity
and
industry
benefits
himself
must
also
benefit
others
normally
the
man
of
great
productive
capacity
who
becomes
rich
by
guiding
the
labor
of
many
other
men
does
so
by
enabling
them
to
produce
more
than
they
could
produce
without
his
guidance
and
both
he
and
they
share
in
the
benefit
which
comes
also
to
the
public
at
large
the
superficial
fact
that
the
sharing
may
be
unequal
must
never
blind
us
to
the
underlying
fact
that
there
is
this
sharing
and
that
the
benefit
comes
in
some
degree
to
each
man
concerned
normally
the
wageworker
the
man
of
small
means
and
the
average
consumer
as
well
as
the
average
producer
are
all
alike
helped
by
making
conditions
such
that
the
man
of
exceptional
business
ability
receives
an
exceptional
reward
for
his
ability
something
can
be
done
by
legislation
to
help
the
general
prosperity
but
no
such
help
of
a
permanently
beneficial
character
can
be
given
to
the
less
able
and
less
fortunate
save
as
the
results
of
a
policy
which
shall
inure
to
the
advantage
of
all
industrious
and
efficient
people
who
act
decently
and
this
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
any
benefit
which
comes
to
the
less
able
and
less
fortunate
must
of
necessity
come
even
more
to
the
more
able
and
more
fortunate
if
therefore
the
less
fortunate
man
is
moved
by
envy
of
his
more
fortunate
brother
to
strike
at
the
conditions
under
which
they
have
both
though
unequally
prospered
the
result
will
assuredly
be
that
while
damage
may
come
to
the
one
struck
at
it
will
visit
with
an
even
heavier
load
the
one
who
strikes
the
blow
taken
as
a
whole
we
must
all
go
up
or
go
down
together
yet
while
not
merely
admitting
but
insisting
upon
this
it
is
also
true
that
where
there
is
no
governmental
restraint
or
supervision
some
of
the
exceptional
men
use
their
energies
not
in
ways
that
are
for
the
common
good
but
in
ways
which
tell
against
this
common
good
the
fortunes
amassed
through
corporate
organization
are
now
so
large
and
vest
such
power
in
those
that
wield
them
as
to
make
it
a
matter
of
necessity
to
give
to
the
sovereignthat
is
to
the
government
which
represents
the
people
as
a
wholesome
effective
power
of
supervision
over
their
corporate
use
in
order
to
insure
a
healthy
social
and
industrial
life
every
big
corporation
should
be
held
responsible
by
and
be
accountable
to
some
sovereign
strong
enough
to
control
its
conduct
i
am
in
no
sense
hostile
to
corporations
this
is
an
age
of
combination
and
any
effort
to
prevent
all
combination
will
be
not
only
useless
but
in
the
end
vicious
because
of
the
contempt
for
law
which
the
failure
to
enforce
law
inevitably
produces
we
should
moreover
recognize
in
cordial
and
ample
fashion
the
immense
good
effected
by
corporate
agencies
in
a
country
such
as
ours
and
the
wealth
of
intellect
energy
and
fidelity
devoted
to
their
service
and
therefore
normally
to
the
service
of
the
public
by
their
officers
and
directors
the
corporation
has
come
to
stay
just
as
the
trade
union
has
come
to
stay
each
can
do
and
has
done
great
good
each
should
be
favored
so
long
as
it
does
good
but
each
should
be
sharply
checked
where
it
acts
against
law
and
justice
the
makers
of
our
national
constitution
provided
especially
that
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
should
come
within
the
sphere
of
the
general
government
the
arguments
in
favor
of
their
taking
this
stand
were
even
then
overwhelming
but
they
are
far
stronger
today
in
view
of
the
enormous
development
of
great
business
agencies
usually
corporate
in
form
experience
has
shown
conclusively
that
it
is
useless
to
try
to
get
any
adequate
regulation
and
supervision
of
these
great
corporations
by
state
action
such
regulation
and
supervision
can
only
be
effectively
exercised
by
a
sovereign
whose
jurisdiction
is
coextensive
with
the
field
of
work
of
the
corporationsthat
is
by
the
national
government
i
believe
that
this
regulation
and
supervision
can
be
obtained
by
the
enactment
of
law
by
the
congress
our
steady
aim
should
be
by
legislation
cautiously
and
carefully
undertaken
but
resolutely
persevered
in
to
assert
the
sovereignty
of
the
national
government
by
affirmative
action
this
is
only
in
form
an
innovation
in
substance
it
is
merely
a
restoration
for
from
the
earliest
time
such
regulation
of
industrial
activities
has
been
recognized
in
the
action
of
the
lawmaking
bodies
and
all
that
i
propose
is
to
meet
the
changed
conditions
in
such
manner
as
will
prevent
the
commonwealth
abdicating
the
power
it
has
always
possessed
not
only
in
this
country
but
also
in
england
before
and
since
this
country
became
a
separate
nation
it
has
been
a
misfortune
that
the
national
laws
on
this
subject
have
hitherto
been
of
a
negative
or
prohibitive
rather
than
an
affirmative
kind
and
still
more
that
they
have
in
part
sought
to
prohibit
what
could
not
be
effectively
prohibited
and
have
in
part
in
their
prohibitions
confounded
what
should
be
allowed
and
what
should
not
be
allowed
it
is
generally
useless
to
try
to
prohibit
all
restraint
on
competition
whether
this
restraint
be
reasonable
or
unreasonable
and
where
it
is
not
useless
it
is
generally
hurtful
the
successful
prosecution
of
one
device
to
evade
the
law
immediately
develops
another
device
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
what
is
needed
is
not
sweeping
prohibition
of
every
arrangement
good
or
bad
which
may
tend
to
restrict
competition
but
such
adequate
supervision
and
regulation
as
will
prevent
any
restriction
of
competition
from
being
to
the
detriment
of
the
public
as
well
as
such
supervision
and
regulation
as
will
prevent
other
abuses
in
no
way
connected
with
restriction
of
competition
i
have
called
your
attention
in
these
quotations
to
what
i
have
already
said
because
i
am
satisfied
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
national
government
to
embody
in
action
the
principles
thus
expressed
no
small
part
of
the
trouble
that
we
have
comes
from
carrying
to
an
extreme
the
national
virtue
of
selfreliance
of
independence
in
initiative
and
action
it
is
wise
to
conserve
this
virtue
and
to
provide
for
its
fullest
exercise
compatible
with
seeing
that
liberty
does
not
become
a
liberty
to
wrong
others
unfortunately
this
is
the
kind
of
liberty
that
the
lack
of
all
effective
regulation
inevitably
breeds
the
founders
of
the
constitution
provided
that
the
national
government
should
have
complete
and
sole
control
of
interstate
commerce
there
was
then
practically
no
interstate
business
save
such
as
was
conducted
by
water
and
this
the
national
government
at
once
proceeded
to
regulate
in
thoroughgoing
and
effective
fashion
conditions
have
now
so
wholly
changed
that
the
interstate
commerce
by
water
is
insignificant
compared
with
the
amount
that
goes
by
land
and
almost
all
big
business
concerns
are
now
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
as
a
result
it
can
be
but
partially
and
imperfectly
controlled
or
regulated
by
the
action
of
any
one
of
the
several
states
such
action
inevitably
tending
to
be
either
too
drastic
or
else
too
lax
and
in
either
case
ineffective
for
purposes
of
jus
tice
only
the
national
government
can
in
thoroughgoing
fashion
exercise
the
needed
control
this
does
not
mean
that
there
should
be
any
extension
of
federal
authority
for
such
authority
already
exists
under
the
constitution
in
amplest
and
most
farreaching
form
but
it
does
mean
that
there
should
be
an
extension
of
federal
activity
this
is
not
advocating
centralization
it
is
merely
looking
facts
in
the
face
and
realizing
that
centralization
in
business
has
already
come
and
can
not
be
avoided
or
undone
and
that
the
public
at
large
can
only
protect
itself
from
certain
evil
effects
of
this
business
centralization
by
providing
better
methods
for
the
exercise
of
control
through
the
authority
already
centralized
in
the
national
government
by
the
constitution
itself
there
must
be
no
ball
in
the
healthy
constructive
course
of
action
which
this
nation
has
elected
to
pursue
and
has
steadily
pursued
during
the
last
six
years
as
shown
both
in
the
legislation
of
the
congress
and
the
administration
of
the
law
by
the
department
of
justice
the
most
vital
need
is
in
connection
with
the
railroads
as
to
these
in
my
judgment
there
should
now
be
either
a
national
incorporation
act
or
a
law
licensing
railway
companies
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
upon
certain
conditions
the
law
should
be
so
framed
as
to
give
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
power
to
pass
upon
the
future
issue
of
securities
while
ample
means
should
be
provided
to
enable
the
commission
whenever
in
its
judgment
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
physical
valuation
of
any
railroad
as
i
stated
in
my
message
to
the
congress
a
year
ago
railroads
should
be
given
power
to
enter
into
agreements
subject
to
these
agreements
being
made
public
in
minute
detail
and
to
the
consent
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
being
first
obtained
until
the
national
government
assumes
proper
control
of
interstate
commerce
in
the
exercise
of
the
authority
it
already
possesses
it
will
be
impossible
either
to
give
to
or
to
get
from
the
railroads
full
justice
the
railroads
and
all
other
great
corporations
will
do
well
to
recognize
that
this
control
must
come
the
only
question
is
as
to
what
governmental
body
can
most
wisely
exercise
it
the
courts
will
determine
the
limits
within
which
the
federal
authority
can
exercise
it
and
there
will
still
remain
ample
work
within
each
state
for
the
railway
commission
of
that
state
and
the
national
interstate
commerce
commission
will
work
in
harmony
with
the
several
state
commissions
each
within
its
own
province
to
achieve
the
desired
end
moreover
in
my
judgment
there
should
be
additional
legislation
looking
to
the
proper
control
of
the
great
business
concerns
engaged
in
interstate
business
this
control
to
be
exercised
for
their
own
benefit
and
prosperity
no
less
than
for
the
protection
of
investors
and
of
the
general
public
as
i
have
repeatedly
said
in
messages
to
the
congress
and
elsewhere
experience
has
definitely
shown
not
merely
the
unwisdom
but
the
futility
of
endeavoring
to
put
a
stop
to
all
business
combinations
modern
industrial
conditions
are
such
that
combination
is
not
only
necessary
but
inevitable
it
is
so
in
the
world
of
business
just
as
it
is
so
in
the
world
of
labor
and
it
is
as
idle
to
desire
to
put
an
end
to
all
corporations
to
all
big
combinations
of
capital
as
to
desire
to
put
an
end
to
combinations
of
labor
corporation
and
labor
union
alike
have
come
to
stay
each
if
properly
managed
is
a
source
of
good
and
not
evil
whenever
in
either
there
is
evil
it
should
be
promptly
held
to
account
but
it
should
receive
hearty
encouragement
so
long
as
it
is
properly
managed
it
is
profoundly
immoral
to
put
or
keep
on
the
statute
books
a
law
nominally
in
the
interest
of
public
morality
that
really
puts
a
premium
upon
public
immorality
by
undertaking
to
forbid
honest
men
from
doing
what
must
be
done
under
modern
business
conditions
so
that
the
law
itself
provides
that
its
own
infraction
must
be
the
condition
precedent
upon
business
success
to
aim
at
the
accomplishment
of
too
much
usually
means
the
accomplishment
of
too
little
and
often
the
doing
of
positive
damage
in
my
message
to
the
congress
a
year
ago
in
speaking
of
the
antitrust
laws
i
said
the
actual
working
of
our
laws
has
shown
that
the
effort
to
prohibit
all
combination
good
or
bad
is
noxious
where
it
is
not
ineffective
combination
of
capital
like
combination
of
labor
is
a
necessary
element
in
our
present
industrial
system
it
is
not
possible
completely
to
prevent
it
and
if
it
were
possible
such
complete
prevention
would
do
damage
to
the
body
politic
what
we
need
is
not
vainly
to
try
to
prevent
all
combination
but
to
secure
such
rigorous
and
adequate
control
and
supervision
of
the
combinations
as
to
prevent
their
injuring
the
public
or
existing
in
such
forms
as
inevitably
to
threaten
injury
it
is
unfortunate
that
our
present
laws
should
forbid
all
combinations
instead
of
sharply
discriminating
between
those
combinations
which
do
evil
often
railroads
would
like
to
combine
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
big
shipper
from
maintaining
improper
advantages
at
the
expense
of
small
shippers
and
of
the
general
public
such
a
combination
instead
of
being
forbidden
by
law
should
be
favored
it
is
a
public
evil
to
have
on
the
statute
books
a
law
incapable
of
full
enforcement
because
both
judges
and
juries
realize
that
its
full
enforcement
would
destroy
the
business
of
the
country
for
the
result
is
to
make
decent
men
violators
of
the
law
against
their
will
and
to
put
a
premium
on
the
behavior
of
the
willful
wrongdoers
such
a
result
in
turn
tends
to
throw
the
decent
man
and
the
willful
wrongdoer
into
close
association
and
in
the
end
to
drag
down
the
former
to
the
latters
level
for
the
man
who
becomes
a
lawbreaker
in
one
way
unhappily
tends
to
lose
all
respect
for
law
and
to
be
willing
to
break
it
in
many
ways
no
more
scathing
condemnation
could
be
visited
upon
a
law
than
is
contained
in
the
words
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
in
commenting
upon
the
fact
that
the
numerous
joint
traffic
associations
do
technically
violate
the
law
they
say
the
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
transmissouri
case
and
the
joint
traffic
association
case
has
produced
no
practical
effect
upon
the
railway
operations
of
the
country
such
associations
in
fact
exist
now
as
they
did
before
these
decisions
and
with
the
same
general
effect
in
justice
to
all
parties
we
ought
probably
to
add
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
our
interstate
railways
could
be
operated
with
due
regard
to
the
interest
of
the
shipper
and
the
railway
without
concerted
action
of
the
kind
afforded
through
these
associations
this
means
that
the
law
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
is
such
that
the
business
of
the
country
can
not
be
conducted
without
breaking
it
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
all
this
is
substantially
what
i
have
said
over
and
over
again
surely
it
ought
not
to
be
necessary
to
say
that
it
in
no
shape
or
way
represents
any
hostility
to
corporations
as
such
on
the
contrary
it
means
a
frank
recognition
of
the
fact
that
combinations
of
capital
like
combinations
of
labor
are
a
natural
result
of
modern
conditions
and
of
our
national
development
as
far
as
in
my
ability
lies
my
endeavor
is
and
will
be
to
prevent
abuse
of
power
by
either
and
to
favor
both
so
long
as
they
do
well
the
aim
of
the
national
government
is
quite
as
much
to
favor
and
protect
honest
corporations
honest
business
men
of
wealth
as
to
bring
to
justice
those
individuals
and
corporations
representing
dishonest
methods
most
certainly
there
will
be
no
relaxation
by
the
government
authorities
in
the
effort
to
get
at
any
great
railroad
wreckerany
man
who
by
clever
swindling
devices
robs
investors
oppresses
wageworkers
and
does
injustice
to
the
general
public
but
any
such
move
as
this
is
in
the
interest
of
honest
railway
operators
of
honest
corporations
and
of
those
who
when
they
invest
their
small
savings
in
stocks
and
bonds
wish
to
be
assured
that
these
will
represent
money
honestly
expended
for
legitimate
business
purposes
to
confer
upon
the
national
government
the
power
for
which
i
ask
would
be
a
check
upon
overcapitalization
and
upon
the
clever
gamblers
who
benefit
by
overcapitalization
but
it
alone
would
mean
an
increase
in
the
value
an
increase
in
the
safety
of
the
stocks
and
bonds
of
lawabiding
honestly
managed
railroads
and
would
render
it
far
easier
to
market
their
securities
i
believe
in
proper
publicity
there
has
been
complaint
of
some
of
the
investigations
recently
carried
on
but
those
who
complain
should
put
the
blame
where
it
belongsupon
the
misdeeds
which
are
done
in
darkness
and
not
upon
the
investigations
which
brought
them
to
light
the
administration
is
responsible
for
turning
on
the
light
but
it
is
not
responsible
for
what
the
light
showed
i
ask
for
full
power
to
be
given
the
federal
government
because
no
single
state
can
by
legislation
effectually
cope
with
these
powerful
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
while
doing
them
full
justice
exact
from
them
in
return
full
justice
to
others
the
conditions
of
railroad
activity
the
conditions
of
our
immense
interstate
commerce
are
such
as
to
make
the
central
government
alone
competent
to
exercise
full
supervision
and
control
the
grave
abuses
in
individual
cases
of
railroad
management
in
the
past
represent
wrongs
not
merely
to
the
general
public
but
above
all
wrongs
to
fairdealing
and
honest
corporations
and
men
of
wealth
because
they
excite
a
popular
anger
and
distrust
which
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
tends
to
include
in
the
sweep
of
its
resentment
good
and
bad
alike
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public
i
can
not
too
earnestly
say
that
as
soon
as
the
natural
and
proper
resentment
aroused
by
these
abuses
becomes
indiscriminate
and
unthinking
it
also
becomes
not
merely
unwise
and
unfair
but
calculated
to
defeat
the
very
ends
which
those
feeling
it
have
in
view
there
has
been
plenty
of
dishonest
work
by
corporations
in
the
past
there
will
not
be
the
slightest
letup
in
the
effort
to
hunt
down
and
punish
ever
y
dishonest
man
but
the
bulk
of
our
business
is
honestly
done
in
the
natural
indignation
the
people
feel
over
the
dishonesty
it
is
essential
that
they
should
not
lose
their
heads
and
get
drawn
into
an
indiscriminate
raid
upon
all
corporations
all
people
of
wealth
whether
they
do
well
or
ill
out
of
any
such
wild
movement
good
will
not
come
can
not
come
and
never
has
come
on
the
contrary
the
surest
way
to
invite
reaction
is
to
follow
the
lead
of
either
demagogue
or
visionary
in
a
sweeping
assault
upon
property
values
and
upon
public
confidence
which
would
work
incalculable
damage
in
the
business
world
and
would
produce
such
distrust
of
the
agitators
that
in
the
revulsion
the
distrust
would
extend
to
honest
men
who
in
sincere
and
same
fashion
are
trying
to
remedy
the
evils
the
antitrust
law
should
not
be
repealed
but
it
should
be
made
both
more
efficient
and
more
in
harmony
with
actual
conditions
it
should
be
so
amended
as
to
forbid
only
the
kind
of
combination
which
does
harm
to
the
general
public
such
amendment
to
be
accompanied
by
or
to
be
an
incident
of
a
grant
of
supervisory
power
to
the
government
over
these
big
concerns
engaged
in
interstate
business
this
should
be
accompanied
by
provision
for
the
compulsory
publication
of
accounts
and
the
subjection
of
books
and
papers
to
the
inspection
of
the
government
officials
a
beginning
has
already
been
made
for
such
supervision
by
the
establishment
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
the
antitrust
law
should
not
prohibit
combinations
that
do
no
injustice
to
the
public
still
less
those
the
existence
of
which
is
on
the
whole
of
benefit
to
the
public
but
even
if
this
feature
of
the
law
were
abolished
there
would
remain
as
an
equally
objectionable
feature
the
difficulty
and
delay
now
incident
to
its
enforcement
the
government
must
now
submit
to
irksome
and
repeated
delay
before
obtaining
a
final
decision
of
the
courts
upon
proceedings
instituted
and
even
a
favorable
decree
may
mean
an
empty
victory
moreover
to
attempt
to
control
these
corporations
by
lawsuits
means
to
impose
upon
both
the
department
of
justice
and
the
courts
an
impossible
burden
it
is
not
feasible
to
carry
on
more
than
a
limited
number
of
such
suits
such
a
law
to
be
really
effective
must
of
course
be
administered
by
an
executive
body
and
not
merely
by
means
of
lawsuits
the
design
should
be
to
prevent
the
abuses
incident
to
the
creation
of
unhealthy
and
improper
combinations
instead
of
waiting
until
they
are
in
existence
and
then
attempting
to
destroy
them
by
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
a
combination
should
not
be
tolerated
if
it
abuse
the
power
acquired
by
combination
to
the
public
detriment
no
corporation
or
association
of
any
kind
should
be
permitted
to
engage
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce
that
is
formed
for
the
purpose
of
or
whose
operations
create
a
monopoly
or
general
control
of
the
production
sale
or
distribution
of
any
one
or
more
of
the
prime
necessities
of
life
or
articles
of
general
use
and
necessity
such
combinations
are
against
public
policy
they
violate
the
common
law
the
doors
of
the
courts
are
closed
to
those
who
are
parties
to
them
and
i
believe
the
congress
can
close
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
against
them
for
its
protection
the
law
should
make
its
prohibitions
and
permissions
as
clear
and
definite
as
possible
leaving
the
least
possible
room
for
arbitrary
action
or
allegation
of
such
action
on
the
part
of
the
executive
or
of
divergent
interpretations
by
the
courts
among
the
points
to
be
aimed
at
should
be
the
prohibition
of
unhealthy
competition
such
as
by
rendering
service
at
an
actual
loss
for
the
purpose
of
crushing
out
competition
the
prevention
of
inflation
of
capital
and
the
prohibition
of
a
corporations
making
exclusive
trade
with
itself
a
condition
of
having
any
trade
with
itself
reasonable
agreements
between
or
combinations
of
corporations
should
be
permitted
provided
they
are
submitted
to
and
approved
by
some
appropriate
government
body
the
congress
has
the
power
to
charter
corporations
to
engage
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
a
general
law
can
be
enacted
under
the
provisions
of
which
existing
corporations
could
take
out
federal
charters
and
new
federal
corporations
could
be
created
an
essential
provision
of
such
a
law
should
be
a
method
of
predetermining
by
some
federal
board
or
commission
whether
the
applicant
for
a
federal
charter
was
an
association
or
combination
within
the
restrictions
of
the
federal
law
provision
should
also
be
made
for
complete
publicity
in
all
matters
affecting
the
public
and
complete
protection
to
the
investing
public
and
the
shareholders
in
the
matter
of
issuing
corporate
securities
if
an
incorporation
law
is
not
deemed
advisable
a
license
act
for
big
interstate
corporations
might
be
enacted
or
a
combination
of
the
two
might
be
tried
the
supervision
established
might
be
analogous
to
that
now
exercised
over
national
banks
at
least
the
antitrust
act
should
be
supplemented
by
specific
prohibitions
of
the
methods
which
experience
has
shown
have
been
of
most
service
in
enabling
monopolistic
combinations
to
crush
out
competition
the
real
owners
of
a
corporation
should
be
compelled
to
do
business
in
their
own
name
the
right
to
hold
stock
in
other
corporations
should
hereafter
be
denied
to
interstate
corporations
unless
on
approval
by
the
government
officials
and
a
prerequisite
to
such
approval
should
be
the
listing
with
the
government
of
all
owners
and
stockholders
both
by
the
corporation
owning
such
stock
and
by
the
corporation
in
which
such
stock
is
owned
to
confer
upon
the
national
government
in
connection
with
the
amendment
i
advocate
in
the
antitrust
law
power
of
supervision
over
big
business
concerns
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
would
benefit
them
as
it
has
benefited
the
national
banks
in
the
recent
business
crisis
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
institutions
which
failed
were
institutions
which
were
not
under
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
national
government
those
which
were
under
national
control
stood
the
test
national
control
of
the
kind
above
advocated
would
be
to
the
benefit
of
every
wellmanaged
railway
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public
there
is
need
for
additional
tracks
additional
terminals
and
improvements
in
the
actual
handling
of
the
railroads
and
all
this
as
rapidly
as
possible
ample
safe
and
speedy
transportation
facilities
are
even
more
necessary
than
cheap
transportation
therefore
there
is
need
for
the
investment
of
money
which
will
provide
for
all
these
things
while
at
the
same
time
securing
as
far
as
is
possible
better
wages
and
shorter
hours
for
their
employees
therefore
while
there
must
be
just
and
reasonable
regulation
of
rates
we
should
be
the
first
to
protest
against
any
arbitrary
and
unthinking
movement
to
cut
them
down
without
the
fullest
and
most
careful
consideration
of
all
interests
concerned
and
of
the
actual
needs
of
the
situation
only
a
special
body
of
men
acting
for
the
national
government
under
authority
conferred
upon
it
by
the
congress
is
competent
to
pass
judgment
on
such
a
matter
those
who
fear
from
any
reason
the
extension
of
federal
activity
will
do
well
to
study
the
history
not
only
of
the
national
banking
act
but
of
the
purefood
law
and
notably
the
meat
inspection
law
recently
enacted
the
purefood
law
was
opposed
so
violently
that
its
passage
was
delayed
for
a
decade
yet
it
has
worked
unmixed
and
immediate
good
the
meat
inspection
law
was
even
more
violently
assailed
and
the
same
men
who
now
denounce
the
attitude
of
the
national
government
in
seeking
to
oversee
and
control
the
workings
of
interstate
common
carriers
and
business
concerns
then
asserted
that
we
were
discrediting
and
ruining
a
great
american
industry
two
years
have
not
elapsed
and
already
it
has
become
evident
that
the
great
benefit
the
law
confers
upon
the
public
is
accompanied
by
an
equal
benefit
to
the
reputable
packing
establishments
the
latter
are
better
off
under
the
law
than
they
were
without
it
the
benefit
to
interstate
common
carriers
and
business
concerns
from
the
legislation
i
advocate
would
be
equally
marked
incidentally
in
the
passage
of
the
purefood
law
the
action
of
the
various
state
food
and
dairy
commissioners
showed
in
striking
fashion
how
much
good
for
the
whole
people
results
from
the
hearty
cooperation
of
the
federal
and
state
officials
in
securing
a
given
reform
it
is
primarily
to
the
action
of
these
state
commissioners
that
we
owe
the
enactment
of
this
law
for
they
aroused
the
people
first
to
demand
the
enactment
and
enforcement
of
state
laws
on
the
subject
and
then
the
enactment
of
the
federal
law
without
which
the
state
laws
were
largely
ineffective
there
must
be
the
closest
cooperation
between
the
national
and
state
governments
in
administering
these
laws
in
my
message
to
the
congress
a
year
ago
i
spoke
as
follows
of
the
currency
i
especially
call
your
attention
to
the
condition
of
our
currency
laws
the
nationalbank
act
has
ably
served
a
great
purpose
in
aiding
the
enormous
business
development
of
the
country
and
within
ten
years
there
has
been
an
increase
in
circulation
per
capita
from
to
for
several
years
evidence
has
been
accumulating
that
additional
legislation
is
needed
the
recurrence
of
each
crop
season
emphasizes
the
defects
of
the
present
laws
there
must
soon
be
a
revision
of
them
because
to
leave
them
as
they
are
means
to
incur
liability
of
business
disaster
since
your
body
adjourned
there
has
been
a
fluctuation
in
the
interest
on
call
money
from
per
cent
to
percent
and
the
fluctuation
was
even
greater
during
the
preceding
six
months
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
to
step
in
and
by
wise
action
put
a
stop
to
the
most
violent
period
of
oscillation
even
worse
than
such
fluctuation
is
the
advance
in
commercial
rates
and
the
uncertainty
felt
in
the
sufficiency
of
credit
even
at
high
rates
all
commercial
interests
suffer
during
each
crop
period
excessive
rates
for
call
money
in
new
york
attract
money
from
the
interior
banks
into
the
speculative
field
this
depletes
the
fund
that
would
otherwise
be

available
for
commercial
uses
and
commercial
borrowers
are
forced
to
pay
abnormal
rates
so
that
each
fall
a
tax
in
the
shape
of
increased
interest
charges
is
placed
on
the
whole
commerce
of
the
country
the
mere
statement
of
these
facts
shows
that
our
present
system
is
seriously
defective
there
is
need
of
a
change
unfortunately
however
many
of
the
proposed
changes
must
be
ruled
from
consideration
because
they
are
complicated
are
not
easy
of
comprehension
and
tend
to
disturb
existing
rights
and
interests
we
must
also
rule
out
any
plan
which
would
materially
impair
the
value
of
the
united
states
per
cent
bonds
now
pledged
to
secure
circulation
the
issue
of
which
was
made
under
conditions
peculiarly
creditable
to
the
treasury
i
do
not
press
any
especial
plan
various
plans
have
recently
been
proposed
by
expert
committees
of
bankers
among
the
plans
which
are
possibly
feasible
and
which
certainly
should
receive
your
consideration
is
that
repeatedly
brought
to
your
attention
by
the
present
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
essential
features
of
which
have
been
approved
by
many
prominent
bankers
and
business
men
according
to
this
plan
national
banks
should
be
permitted
to
issue
a
specified
proportion
of
their
capital
in
notes
of
a
given
kind
the
issue
to
be
taxed
at
so
high
a
rate
as
to
drive
the
notes
back
when
not
wanted
in
legitimate
trade
this
plan
would
not
permit
the
issue
of
currency
to
give
banks
additional
profits
but
to
meet
the
emergency
presented
by
times
of
stringency
i
do
not
say
that
this
is
the
right
system
i
only
advance
it
to
emphasize
my
belief
that
there
is
need
for
the
adoption
of
some
system
which
shall
be
automatic
and
open
to
all
sound
banks
so
as
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
discrimination
and
favoritism
such
a
plan
would
tend
to
prevent
the
spasms
of
high
money
and
speculation
which
now
obtain
in
the
new
york
market
for
at
present
there
is
too
much
currency
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
and
its
accumulation
at
new
york
tempts
bankers
to
lend
it
at
low
rates
for
speculative
purposes
whereas
at
other
times
when
the
crops
are
being
moved
there
is
urgent
need
for
a
large
but
temporary
increase
in
the
currency
supply
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
this
question
concerns
business
men
generally
quite
as
much
as
bankers
especially
is
this
true
of
stockmen
farmers
and
business
men
in
the
west
for
at
present
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
the
difference
in
interest
rates
between
the
east
and
the
west
is
from
to
per
cent
whereas
in
canada
the
corresponding
difference
is
but
per
cent
any
plan
must
of
course
guard
the
interests
of
western
and
southern
bankers
as
carefully
as
it
guards
the
interests
of
new
york
or
chicago
bankers
and
must
be
drawn
from
the
standpoints
of
the
farmer
and
the
merchant
no
less
than
from
the
standpoints
of
the
city
banker
and
the
country
banker
i
again
urge
on
the
congress
the
need
of
immediate
attention
to
this
matter
we
need
a
greater
elasticity
in
our
currency
provided
of
course
that
we
recognize
the
even
greater
need
of
a
safe
and
secure
currency
there
must
always
be
the
most
rigid
examination
by
the
national
authorities
provision
should
be
made
for
an
emergency
currency
the
emergency
issue
should
of
course
be
made
with
an
effective
guaranty
and
upon
conditions
carefully
prescribed
by
the
government
such
emergency
issue
must
be
based
on
adequate
securities
approved
by
the
government
and
must
be
issued
under
a
heavy
tax
this
would
permit
currency
being
issued
when
the
demand
for
it
was
urgent
while
securing
its
requirement
as
the
demand
fell
off
it
is
worth
investigating
to
determine
whether
officers
and
directors
of
national
banks
should
ever
be
allowed
to
loan
to
themselves
trust
companies
should
be
subject
to
the
same
supervision
as
banks
legislation
to
this
effect
should
be
enacted
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territories
yet
we
must
also
remember
that
even
the
wisest
legislation
on
the
subject
can
only
accomplish
a
certain
amount
no
legislation
can
by
any
possibility
guarantee
the
business
community
against
the
results
of
speculative
folly
any
more
than
it
can
guarantee
an
individual
against
the
results
of
his
extravagance
when
an
individual
mortgages
his
house
to
buy
an
automobile
he
invites
disaster
and
when
wealthy
men
or
men
who
pose
as
such
or
are
unscrupulously
or
foolishly
eager
to
become
such
indulge
in
reckless
speculationespecially
if
it
is
accompanied
by
dishonestythey
jeopardize
not
only
their
own
future
but
the
future
of
all
their
innocent
fellowcitizens
for
the
expose
the
whole
business
community
to
panic
and
distress
the
income
account
of
the
nation
is
in
a
most
satisfactory
condition
for
the
six
fiscal
years
ending
with
the
st
of
july
last
the
total
expenditures
and
revenues
of
the
national
government
exclusive
of
the
postal
revenues
and
expenditures
were
in
round
numbers
revenues
and
expenditures
the
net
excess
of
income
over
expenditures
including
in
the
latter
the
fifty
millions
expended
for
the
panama
canal
was
one
hundred
and
ninety
million
dollars
for
the
six
years
an
average
of
about
thirtyone
millions
a
year
this
represents
an
approximation
between
income
and
outgo
which
it
would
be
hard
to
improve
the
satisfactory
working
of
the
present
tariff
law
has
been
chiefly
responsible
for
this
excellent
showing
nevertheless
there
is
an
evident
and
constantly
growing
feeling
among
our
people
that
the
time
is
rapidly
approaching
when
our
system
of
revenue
legislation
must
be
revised
this
country
is
definitely
committed
to
the
protective
system
and
any
effort
to
uproot
it
could
not
but
cause
widespread
industrial
disaster
in
other
words
the
principle
of
the
present
tariff
law
could
not
with
wisdom
be
changed
but
in
a
country
of
such
phenomenal
growth
as
ours
it
is
probably
well
that
every
dozen
years
or
so
the
tariff
laws
should
be
carefully
scrutinized
so
as
to
see
that
no
excessive
or
improper
benefits
are
conferred
thereby
that
proper
revenue
is
provided
and
that
our
foreign
trade
is
encouraged
there
must
always
be
as
a
minimum
a
tariff
which
will
not
only
allow
for
the
collection
of
an
ample
revenue
but
which
will
at
least
make
good
the
difference
in
cost
of
production
here
and
abroad
that
is
the
difference
in
the
labor
cost
here
and
abroad
for
the
wellbeing
of
the
wageworker
must
ever
be
a
cardinal
point
of
american
policy
the
question
should
be
approached
purely
from
a
business
standpoint
both
the
time
and
the
manner
of
the
change
being
such
as
to
arouse
the
minimum
of
agitation
and
disturbance
in
the
business
world
and
to
give
the
least
play
for
selfish
and
factional
motives
the
sole
consideration
should
be
to
see
that
the
sum
total
of
changes
represents
the
public
good
this
means
that
the
subject
can
not
with
wisdom
be
dealt
with
in
the
year
preceding
a
presidential
election
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
experience
has
conclusively
shown
that
at
such
a
time
it
is
impossible
to
get
men
to
treat
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public
good
in
my
judgment
the
wise
time
to
deal
with
the
matter
is
immediately
after
such
election
when
our
tax
laws
are
revised
the
question
of
an
income
tax
and
an
inheritance
tax
should
receive
the
careful
attention
of
our
legislators
in
my
judgment
both
of
these
taxes
should
be
part
of
our
system
of
federal
taxation
i
speak
diffidently
about
the
income
tax
because
one
scheme
for
an
income
tax
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
while
in
addition
it
is
a
difficult
tax
to
administer
in
its
practical
working
and
great
care
would
have
to
be
exercised
to
see
that
it
was
not
evaded
by
the
very
men
whom
it
was
most
desirable
to
have
taxed
for
if
so
evaded
it
would
of
course
be
worse
than
no
tax
at
all
as
the
least
desirable
of
all
taxes
is
the
tax
which
bears
heavily
upon
the
honest
as
compared
with
the
dishonest
man
nevertheless
a
graduated
income
tax
of
the
proper
type
would
be
a
desirable
feature
of
federal
taxation
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
one
may
be
devised
which
the
supreme
court
will
declare
constitutional
the
inheritance
tax
however
is
both
a
far
better
method
of
taxation
and
far
more
important
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
fortunes
of
the
country
bear
in
proportion
to
their
increase
in
size
a
corresponding
increase
and
burden
of
taxation
the
government
has
the
absolute
right
to
decide
as
to
the
terms
upon
which
a
man
shall
receive
a
bequest
or
devise
from
another
and
this
point
in
the
devolution
of
property
is
especially
appropriate
for
the
imposition
of
a
tax
laws
imposing
such
taxes
have
repeatedly
been
placed
upon
the
national
statute
books
and
as
repeatedly
declared
constitutional
by
the
courts
and
these
laws
contained
the
progressive
principle
that
is
after
a
certain
amount
is
reached
the
bequest
or
gift
in
life
or
death
is
increasingly
burdened
and
the
rate
of
taxation
is
increased
in
proportion
to
the
remoteness
of
blood
of
the
man
receiving
the
bequest
these
principles
are
recognized
already
in
the
leading
civilized
nations
of
the
world
in
great
britain
all
the
estates
worth
or
less
are
practically
exempt
from
death
duties
while
the
increase
is
such
that
when
an
estate
exceeds
five
millions
of
dollars
in
value
and
passes
to
a
distant
kinsman
or
stranger
in
blood
the
government
receives
all
told
an
amount
equivalent
to
nearly
a
fifth
of
the
whole
estate
in
france
so
much
of
an
inheritance
as
exceeds
pays
over
a
fifth
to
the
state
if
it
passes
to
a
distant
relative
the
german
law
is
especially
interesting
to
us
because
it
makes
the
inheritance
tax
an
imperial
measure
while
allotting
to
the
individual
states
of
the
empire
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
and
permitting
them
to
impose
taxes
in
addition
to
those
imposed
by
the
imperial
government
small
inheritances
are
exempt
but
the
tax
is
so
sharply
progressive
that
when
the
inheritance
is
still
not
very
large
provided
it
is
not
an
agricultural
or
a
forest
land
it
is
taxed
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
if
it
goes
to
distant
relatives
there
is
no
reason
why
in
the
united
states
the
national
government
should
not
impose
inheritance
taxes
in
addition
to
those
impo
sed
by
the
states
and
when
we
last
had
an
inheritance
tax
about
onehalf
of
the
states
levied
such
taxes
concurrently
with
the
national
government
making
a
combined
maximum
rate
in
some
cases
as
high
as
per
cent
the
french
law
has
one
feature
which
is
to
be
heartily
commended
the
progressive
principle
is
so
applied
that
each
higher
rate
is
imposed
only
on
the
excess
above
the
amount
subject
to
the
next
lower
rate
so
that
each
increase
of
rate
will
apply
only
to
a
certain
amount
above
a
certain
maximum
the
tax
should
if
possible
be
made
to
bear
more
heavily
upon
those
residing
without
the
country
than
within
it
a
heavy
progressive
tax
upon
a
very
large
fortune
is
in
no
way
such
a
tax
upon
thrift
or
industry
as
a
like
would
be
on
a
small
fortune
no
advantage
comes
either
to
the
country
as
a
whole
or
to
the
individuals
inheriting
the
money
by
permitting
the
transmission
in
their
entirety
of
the
enormous
fortunes
which
would
be
affected
by
such
a
tax
and
as
an
incident
to
its
function
of
revenue
raising
such
a
tax
would
help
to
preserve
a
measurable
equality
of
opportunity
for
the
people
of
the
generations
growing
to
manhood
we
have
not
the
slightest
sympathy
with
that
socialistic
idea
which
would
try
to
put
laziness
thriftlessness
and
inefficiency
on
a
par
with
industry
thrift
and
efficiency
which
would
strive
to
break
up
not
merely
private
property
but
what
is
far
more
important
the
home
the
chief
prop
upon
which
our
whole
civilization
stands
such
a
theory
if
ever
adopted
would
mean
the
ruin
of
the
entire
countrya
ruin
which
would
bear
heaviest
upon
the
weakest
upon
those
least
able
to
shift
for
themselves
but
proposals
for
legislation
such
as
this
herein
advocated
are
directly
opposed
to
this
class
of
socialistic
theories
our
aim
is
to
recognize
what
lincoln
pointed
out
the
fact
that
there
are
some
respects
in
which
men
are
obviously
not
equal
but
also
to
insist
that
there
should
be
an
equality
of
selfrespect
and
of
mutual
respect
an
equality
of
rights
before
the
law
and
at
least
an
approximate
equality
in
the
conditions
under
which
each
man
obtains
the
chance
to
show
the
stuff
that
is
in
him
when
compared
to
his
fellows
a
few
years
ago
there
was
loud
complaint
that
the
law
could
not
be
invoked
against
wealthy
offenders
there
is
no
such
complaint
now
the
course
of
the
department
of
justice
during
the
last
few
years
has
been
such
as
to
make
it
evident
that
no
man
stands
above
the
law
that
no
corporation
is
so
wealthy
that
it
can
not
be
held
to
account
the
department
of
justice
has
been
as
prompt
to
proceed
against
the
wealthiest
malefactor
whose
crime
was
one
of
greed
and
cunning
as
to
proceed
against
the
agitator
who
incites
to
brutal
violence
everything
that
can
be
done
under
the
existing
law
and
with
the
existing
state
of
public
opinion
which
so
profoundly
influences
both
the
courts
and
juries
has
been
done
but
the
laws
themselves
need
strengthening
in
more
than
one
important
point
they
should
be
made
more
definite
so
that
no
honest
man
can
be
led
unwittingly
to
break
them
and
so
that
the
real
wrongdoer
can
be
readily
punished
moreover
there
must
be
the
public
opinion
back
of
the
laws
or
the
laws
themselves
will
be
of
no
avail
at
present
while
the
average
juryman
undoubtedly
wishes
to
see
trusts
broken
up
and
is
quite
ready
to
fine
the
corporation
itself
he
is
very
reluctant
to
find
the
facts
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
when
it
comes
to
sending
to
jail
a
member
of
the
business
community
for
indulging
in
practices
which
are
profoundly
unhealthy
but
which
unfortunately
the
business
community
has
grown
to
recognize
as
wellnigh
normal
both
the
present
condition
of
the
law
and
the
present
temper
of
juries
render
it
a
task
of
extreme
difficulty
to
get
at
the
real
wrongdoer
in
any
such
case
especially
by
imprisonment
yet
it
is
from
every
standpoint
far
preferable
to
punish
the
prime
offender
by
imprisonment
rather
than
to
fine
the
corporation
with
the
attendant
damage
to
stockholders
the
two
great
evils
in
the
execution
of
our
criminal
laws
today
are
sentimentality
and
technicality
for
the
latter
the
remedy
must
come
from
the
hands
of
the
legislatures
the
courts
and
the
lawyers
the
other
must
depend
for
its
cure
upon
the
gradual
growth
of
a
sound
public
opinion
which
shall
insist
that
regard
for
the
law
and
the
demands
of
reason
shall
control
all
other
influences
and
emotions
in
the
jury
box
both
of
these
evils
must
be
removed
or
public
discontent
with
the
criminal
law
will
continue
instances
of
abuse
in
the
granting
of
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
continue
to
occur
and
the
resentment
in
the
minds
of
those
who
feel
that
their
rights
are
being
invaded
and
their
liberty
of
action
and
of
speech
unwarrantably
restrained
continues
likewise
to
grow
much
of
the
attack
on
the
use
of
the
process
of
injunction
is
wholly
without
warrant
but
i
am
constrained
to
express
the
belief
that
for
some
of
it
there
is
warrant
this
question
is
becoming
more
and
more
one
of
prime
importance
and
unless
the
courts
will
themselves
deal
with
it
in
effective
manner
it
is
certain
ultimately
to
demand
some
form
of
legislative
action
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
for
our
social
welfare
if
we
should
permit
many
honest
and
lawabiding
citizens
to
feel
that
they
had
just
cause
for
regarding
our
courts
with
hostility
i
earnestly
commend
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
this
matter
so
that
some
way
may
be
devised
which
will
limit
the
abuse
of
injunctions
and
protect
those
rights
which
from
time
to
time
it
unwarrantably
invades
moreover
discontent
is
often
expressed
with
the
use
of
the
process
of
injunction
by
the
courts
not
only
in
labor
disputes
but
where
state
laws
are
concerned
i
refrain
from
discussion
of
this
question
as
i
am
informed
that
it
will
soon
receive
the
consideration
of
the
supreme
court
the
federal
courts
must
of
course
decide
ultimately
what
are
the
respective
spheres
of
state
and
nation
in
connection
with
any
law
state
or
national
and
they
must
decide
definitely
and
finally
in
matters
affecting
individual
citizens
not
only
as
to
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
labor
but
as
to
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
capital
and
the
national
government
must
always
see
that
the
decision
of
the
court
is
put
into
effect
the
process
of
injunction
is
an
essential
adjunct
of
the
courts
doing
its
work
well
and
as
preventive
measures
are
always
better
than
remedial
the
wise
use
of
this
process
is
from
every
standpoint
commendable
but
where
it
is
recklessly
or
unnecessarily
used
the
abuse
should
he
censured
above
all
by
the
very
men
who
are
properly
anxious
to
prevent
any
effort
to
shear
the
courts
of
this
necessary
power
the
courts
decision
must
be
final
the
protest
is
only
against
the
conduct
of
individual
judges
in
needlessly
anticipating
such
final
decision
or
in
the
tyrannical
use
of
what
is
nominally
a
temporary
injunction
to
accomplish
what
is
in
fact
a
permanent
decision
the
loss
of
life
and
limb
from
railroad
accidents
in
this
country
has
become
appalling
it
is
a
subject
of
which
the
national
government
should
take
supervision
it
might
be
well
to
begin
by
providing
for
a
federal
inspection
of
interstate
railroads
somewhat
along
the
lines
of
federal
inspection
of
steamboats
although
not
going
so
far
perhaps
at
first
all
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
would
be
some
officer
whose
duty
would
be
to
investigate
all
accidents
on
interstate
railroads
and
report
in
detail
the
causes
thereof
such
an
officer
should
make
it
his
business
to
get
into
close
touch
with
railroad
operating
men
so
as
to
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
every
side
of
the
question
the
idea
being
to
work
along
the
lines
of
the
present
steamboat
inspection
law
the
national
government
should
be
a
model
employer
it
should
demand
the
highest
quality
of
service
from
each
of
its
employees
and
it
should
care
for
all
of
them
properly
in
return
congress
should
adopt
legislation
providing
limited
but
definite
compensation
for
accidents
to
all
workmen
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
power
including
employees
of
navy
yards
and
arsenals
in
other
words
a
model
employers
liability
act
farreaching
and
thoroughgoing
should
be
enacted
which
should
apply
to
all
positions
public
and
private
over
which
the
national
government
has
jurisdiction
the
number
of
accidents
to
wageworkers
including
those
that
are
preventable
and
those
that
are
not
has
become
appalling
in
the
mechanical
manufacturing
and
transportation
operations
of
the
day
it
works
grim
hardship
to
the
ordinary
wageworker
and
his
family
to
have
the
effect
of
such
an
accident
fall
solely
upon
him
and
on
the
other
hand
there
are
whole
classes
of
attorneys
who
exist
only
by
inciting
men
who
may
or
may
not
have
been
wronged
to
undertake
suits
for
negligence
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
suit
for
negligence
is
generally
an
inadequate
remedy
for
the
person
injured
while
it
often
causes
altogether
disproportionate
annoyance
to
the
employer
the
law
should
be
made
such
that
the
payment
for
accidents
by
the
employer
would
be
automatic
instead
of
being
a
matter
for
lawsuits
workmen
should
receive
certain
and
definite
compensation
for
all
accidents
in
industry
irrespective
of
negligence
the
employer
is
the
agent
of
the
public
and
on
his
own
responsibility
and
for
his
own
profit
he
serves
the
public
when
he
starts
in
motion
agencies
which
create
risks
for
others
he
should
take
all
the
ordinary
and
extraordinary
risks
involved
and
the
risk
he
thus
at
the
moment
assumes
will
ultimately
be
assumed
as
it
ought
to
be
by
the
general
public
only
in
this
way
can
the
shock
of
the
accident
be
diffused
instead
of
falling
upon
the
man
or
woman
least
able
to
bear
it
as
is
now
the
case
the
community
at
large
should
share
the
burdens
as
well
as
the
benefits
of
industry
by
the
proposed
law
employers
would
gain
a
desirable
certainty
of
obligation
and
get
rid
of
litigation
to
determine
it
while
the
workman
and
his
family
would
be
relieved
from
a
crushing
load
with
such
a
policy
would
come
increased
care
and
accidents
would
be
reduced
in
number
the
national
laws
providing
for
employers
li
ability
on
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
for
safety
appliances
as
well
as
for
diminishing
the
hours
any
employee
of
a
railroad
should
be
permitted
to
work
should
all
be
strengthened
wherever
in
actual
practice
they
have
shown
weakness
they
should
be
kept
on
the
statute
books
in
thoroughgoing
form
the
constitutionality
of
the
employers
liability
act
passed
by
the
preceding
congress
has
been
carried
before
the
courts
in
two
jurisdictions
the
law
has
been
declared
unconstitutional
and
in
three
jurisdictions
its
constitutionality
has
been
affirmed
the
question
has
been
carried
to
the
supreme
court
the
case
has
been
heard
by
that
tribunal
and
a
decision
is
expected
at
an
early
date
in
the
event
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
i
urge
further
legislation
along
the
lines
advocated
in
my
message
to
the
preceding
congress
the
practice
of
putting
the
entire
burden
of
loss
to
life
or
limb
upon
the
victim
or
the
victims
family
is
a
form
of
social
injustice
in
which
the
united
states
stands
in
unenviable
prominence
in
both
our
federal
and
state
legislation
we
have
with
few
exceptions
scarcely
gone
farther
than
the
repeal
of
the
fellowservant
principle
of
the
old
law
of
liability
and
in
some
of
our
states
even
this
slight
modification
of
a
completely
outgrown
principle
has
not
yet
been
secured
the
legislation
of
the
rest
of
the
industrial
world
stands
out
in
striking
contrast
to
our
backwardness
in
this
respect
since
practically
every
country
of
europe
together
with
great
britain
new
zealand
australia
british
columbia
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
has
enacted
legislation
embodying
in
one
form
or
another
the
complete
recognition
of
the
principle
which
places
upon
the
employer
the
entire
trade
risk
in
the
various
lines
of
industry
i
urge
upon
the
congress
the
enactment
of
a
law
which
will
at
the
same
time
bring
federal
legislation
up
to
the
standard
already
established
by
all
the
european
countries
and
which
will
serve
as
a
stimulus
to
the
various
states
to
perfect
their
legislation
in
this
regard
the
congress
should
consider
the
extension
of
the
eighthour
law
the
constitutionality
of
the
present
law
has
recently
been
called
into
question
and
the
supreme
court
has
decided
that
the
existing
legislation
is
unquestionably
within
the
powers
of
the
congress
the
principle
of
the
eighthour
day
should
as
rapidly
and
as
far
as
practicable
be
extended
to
the
entire
work
carried
on
by
the
government
and
the
present
law
should
be
amended
to
embrace
contracts
on
those
public
works
which
the
present
wording
of
the
act
has
been
construed
to
exclude
the
general
introduction
of
the
eighthour
day
should
be
the
goal
toward
which
we
should
steadily
tend
and
the
government
should
set
the
example
in
this
respect
strikes
and
lockouts
with
their
attendant
loss
and
suffering
continue
to
increase
for
the
five
years
ending
december
the
number
of
strikes
was
greater
than
those
in
any
previous
ten
years
and
was
double
the
number
in
the
preceding
five
years
these
figures
indicate
the
increasing
need
of
providing
some
machinery
to
deal
with
this
class
of
disturbance
in
the
interest
alike
of
the
employer
the
employee
and
the
general
public
i
renew
my
previous
recommendation
that
the
congress
favorably
consider
the
matter
of
creating
the
machinery
for
compulsory
investigation
of
such
industrial
controversies
as
are
of
sufficient
magnitude
and
of
sufficient
concern
to
the
people
of
the
country
as
a
whole
to
warrant
the
federal
government
in
taking
action
the
need
for
some
provision
for
such
investigation
was
forcibly
illustrated
during
the
past
summer
a
strike
of
telegraph
operators
seriously
interfered
with
telegraphic
communication
causing
great
damage
to
business
interests
and
serious
inconvenience
to
the
general
public
appeals
were
made
to
me
from
many
parts
of
the
country
from
city
councils
from
boards
of
trade
from
chambers
of
commerce
and
from
labor
organizations
urging
that
steps
be
taken
to
terminate
the
strike
everything
that
could
with
any
propriety
be
done
by
a
representative
of
the
government
was
done
without
avail
and
for
weeks
the
public
stood
by
and
suffered
without
recourse
of
any
kind
had
the
machinery
existed
and
had
there
been
authority
for
compulsory
investigation
of
the
dispute
the
public
would
have
been
placed
in
possession
of
the
merits
of
the
controversy
and
public
opinion
would
probably
have
brought
about
a
prompt
adjustment
each
successive
step
creating
machinery
for
the
adjustment
of
labor
difficulties
must
be
taken
with
caution
but
we
should
endeavor
to
make
progress
in
this
direction
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
creating
the
chairman
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
commissioner
of
labor
a
board
of
mediation
in
controversies
between
interstate
railroads
and
their
employees
has
for
the
first
time
been
subjected
to
serious
tests
within
the
past
year
and
the
wisdom
of
the
experiment
has
been
fully
demonstrated
the
creation
of
a
board
for
compulsory
investigation
in
cases
where
mediation
fails
and
arbitration
is
rejected
is
the
next
logical
step
in
a
progressive
program
it
is
certain
that
for
some
time
to
come
there
will
be
a
constant
increase
absolutely
and
perhaps
relatively
of
those
among
our
citizens
who
dwell
in
cities
or
towns
of
some
size
and
who
work
for
wages
this
means
that
there
will
be
an
everincreasing
need
to
consider
the
problems
inseparable
from
a
great
industrial
civilization
where
an
immense
and
complex
business
especially
in
those
branches
relating
to
manufacture
and
transportation
is
transacted
by
a
large
number
of
capitalists
who
employ
a
very
much
larger
number
of
wageearners
the
former
tend
more
and
more
to
combine
into
corporations
and
the
latter
into
unions
the
relations
of
the
capitalist
and
wageworker
to
one
another
and
of
each
to
the
general
public
are
not
always
easy
to
adjust
and
to
put
them
and
keep
them
on
a
satisfactory
basis
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
one
of
the
most
delicate
tasks
before
our
whole
civilization
much
of
the
work
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
end
must
be
done
by
the
individuals
concerned
themselves
whether
singly
or
in
combination
and
the
one
fundamental
fact
that
must
never
be
lost
track
of
is
that
the
character
of
the
average
man
whether
he
be
a
man
of
means
or
a
man
who
works
with
his
hands
is
the
most
important
factor
in
solving
the
problem
aright
but
it
is
almost
equally
important
to
remember
that
without
good
laws
it
is
also
impossible
to
reach
the
proper
solution
it
is
idle
to
hold
that
without
good
laws
evils
such
as
child
labor
as
the
overworking
of
women
as
the
failure
to
protect
employees
from
loss
of
life
or
limb
can
be
effectively
reached
any
more
than
the
evils
of
rebates
and
stockwatering
can
be
reached
without
good
laws
to
fail
to
stop
these
practices
by
legislation
means
to
force
honest
men
into
them
because
otherwise
the
dishonest
who
surely
will
take
advantage
of
them
will
have
everything
their
own
way
if
the
states
will
correct
these
evils
well
and
good
but
the
nation
must
stand
ready
to
aid
them
no
question
growing
out
of
our
rapid
and
complex
industrial
development
is
more
important
than
that
of
the
employment
of
women
and
children
the
presence
of
women
in
industry
reacts
with
extreme
directness
upon
the
character
of
the
home
and
upon
family
life
and
the
conditions
surrounding
the
employment
of
children
bear
a
vital
relation
to
our
future
citizenship
our
legislation
in
those
areas
under
the
control
of
the
congress
is
very
much
behind
the
legislation
of
our
more
progressive
states
a
thorough
and
comprehensive
measure
should
be
adopted
at
this
session
of
the
congress
relating
to
the
employment
of
women
and
children
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territories
the
investigation
into
the
condition
of
women
and
children
wageearners
recently
authorized
and
directed
by
the
congress
is
now
being
carried
on
in
the
various
states
and
i
recommend
that
the
appropriation
made
last
year
for
beginning
this
work
be
renewed
in
order
that
we
may
have
the
thorough
and
comprehensive
investigation
which
the
subject
demands
the
national
government
has
as
an
ultimate
resort
for
control
of
child
labor
the
use
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause
to
prevent
the
products
of
child
labor
from
entering
into
interstate
commerce
but
before
using
this
it
ought
certainly
to
enact
model
laws
on
the
subject
for
the
territories
under
its
own
immediate
control
there
is
one
fundamental
proposition
which
can
be
laid
down
as
regards
all
these
matters
namely
while
honesty
by
itself
will
not
solve
the
problem
yet
the
insistence
upon
honestynot
merely
technical
honesty
but
honesty
in
purpose
and
spiritis
an
essential
element
in
arriving
at
a
right
conclusion
vice
in
its
cruder
and
more
archaic
forms
shocks
everybody
but
there
is
very
urgent
need
that
public
opinion
should
be
just
as
severe
in
condemnation
of
the
vice
which
hides
itself
behind
class
or
professional
loyalty
or
which
denies
that
it
is
vice
if
it
can
escape
conviction
in
the
courts
the
public
and
the
representatives
of
the
public
the
high
officials
whether
on
the
bench
or
in
executive
or
legislative
positions
need
to
remember
that
often
the
most
dangerous
criminals
so
far
as
the
life
of
the
nation
is
concerned
are
not
those
who
commit
the
crimes
known
to
and
condemned
by
the
popular
conscience
for
centuries
but
those
who
commit
crimes
only
rendered
possible
by
the
complex
conditions
of
our
modern
industrial
life
it
makes
not
a
particle
of
difference
whether
these
crimes
are
committed
by
a
capitalist
or
by
a
laborer
by
a
leading
banker
or
manufacturer
or
railroad
man
or
by
a
leading
representative
of
a
labor
union
swindling
in
stocks
corrupting
legislatures
making
fortunes
by
the
inflation
of
securities
by
wrecking
railroads
by
destroying
competitors
through
rebatesthese
forms
of
wrongdoing
in
the
capitalist
are
far
more
infamous
than
any
ordinary
form
of
embezzlement
or
forgery
yet
it
is
a
matter
of
extreme
difficulty
to
secure
the
punishment
of
the
man
most
guilty
of
them
most
resp
onsible
for
them
the
business
man
who
condones
such
conduct
stands
on
a
level
with
the
labor
man
who
deliberately
supports
a
corrupt
demagogue
and
agitator
whether
head
of
a
union
or
head
of
some
municipality
because
he
is
said
to
have
stood
by
the
union
the
members
of
the
business
community
the
educators
or
clergymen
who
condone
and
encourage
the
first
kind
of
wrongdoing
are
no
more
dangerous
to
the
community
but
are
morally
even
worse
than
the
labor
men
who
are
guilty
of
the
second
type
of
wrongdoing
because
less
is
to
be
pardoned
those
who
have
no
such
excuse
as
is
furnished
either
by
ignorance
or
by
dire
need
when
the
department
of
agriculture
was
founded
there
was
much
sneering
as
to
its
usefulness
no
department
of
the
government
however
has
more
emphatically
vindicated
its
usefulness
and
none
save
the
postoffice
department
comes
so
continually
and
intimately
into
touch
with
the
people
the
two
citizens
whose
welfare
is
in
the
aggregate
most
vital
to
the
welfare
of
the
nation
and
therefore
to
the
welfare
of
all
other
citizens
are
the
wageworker
who
does
manual
labor
and
the
tiller
of
the
soil
the
farmer
there
are
of
course
kinds
of
labor
where
the
work
must
be
purely
mental
and
there
are
other
kinds
of
labor
where
under
existing
conditions
very
little
demand
indeed
is
made
upon
the
mind
though
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
proportion
of
men
engaged
in
this
kind
of
work
is
diminishing
but
in
any
community
with
the
solid
healthy
qualities
which
make
up
a
really
great
nation
the
bulk
of
the
people
should
do
work
which
calls
for
the
exercise
of
both
body
and
mind
progress
can
not
permanently
exist
in
the
abandonment
of
physical
labor
but
in
the
development
of
physical
labor
so
that
it
shall
represent
more
and
more
the
work
of
the
trained
mind
in
the
trained
body
our
school
system
is
gravely
defective
in
so
far
as
it
puts
a
premium
upon
mere
literary
training
and
tends
therefore
to
train
the
boy
away
from
the
farm
and
the
workshop
nothing
is
more
needed
than
the
best
type
of
industrial
school
the
school
for
mechanical
industries
in
the
city
the
school
for
practically
teaching
agriculture
in
the
country
the
calling
of
the
skilled
tiller
of
the
soil
the
calling
of
the
skilled
mechanic
should
alike
be
recognized
as
professions
just
as
emphatically
as
the
callings
of
lawyer
doctor
merchant
or
clerk
the
schools
recognize
this
fact
and
it
should
equally
be
recognized
in
popular
opinion
the
young
man
who
has
the
farsightedness
and
courage
to
recognize
it
and
to
get
over
the
idea
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
what
he
earns
is
called
salary
or
wages
and
who
refuses
to
enter
the
crowded
field
of
the
socalled
professions
and
takes
to
constructive
industry
instead
is
reasonably
sure
of
an
ample
reward
in
earnings
in
health
in
opportunity
to
marry
early
and
to
establish
a
home
with
a
fair
amount
of
freedom
from
worry
it
should
be
one
of
our
prime
objects
to
put
both
the
farmer
and
the
mechanic
on
a
higher
plane
of
efficiency
and
reward
so
as
to
increase
their
effectiveness
in
the
economic
world
and
therefore
the
dignity
the
remuneration
and
the
power
of
their
positions
in
the
social
world
no
growth
of
cities
no
growth
of
wealth
can
make
up
for
any
loss
in
either
the
number
or
the
character
of
the
farming
population
we
of
the
united
states
should
realize
this
above
almost
all
other
peoples
we
began
our
existence
as
a
nation
of
farmers
and
in
every
great
crisis
of
the
past
a
peculiar
dependence
has
had
to
be
placed
upon
the
farming
population
and
this
dependence
has
hitherto
been
justified
but
it
can
not
be
justified
in
the
future
if
agriculture
is
permitted
to
sink
in
the
scale
as
compared
with
other
employments
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
that
preeminently
typical
american
the
farmer
who
owns
his
own
mediumsized
farm
to
have
his
place
taken
by
either
a
class
of
small
peasant
proprietors
or
by
a
class
of
great
landlords
with
tenantfarmed
estates
would
be
a
veritable
calamity
the
growth
of
our
cities
is
a
good
thing
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
mean
a
growth
at
the
expense
of
the
country
farmer
we
must
welcome
the
rise
of
physical
sciences
in
their
application
to
agricultural
practices
and
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
render
country
conditions
more
easy
and
pleasant
there
are
forces
which
now
tend
to
bring
about
both
these
results
but
they
are
as
yet
in
their
infancy
the
national
government
through
the
department
of
agriculture
should
do
all
it
can
by
joining
with
the
state
governments
and
with
independent
associations
of
farmers
to
encourage
the
growth
in
the
open
farming
country
of
such
institutional
and
social
movements
as
will
meet
the
demand
of
the
best
type
of
farmers
both
for
the
improvement
of
their
farms
and
for
the
betterment
of
the
life
itself
the
department
of
agriculture
has
in
many
places
perhaps
especially
in
certain
districts
of
the
south
accomplished
an
extraordinary
amount
by
cooperating
with
and
teaching
the
farmers
through
their
associations
on
their
own
soil
how
to
increase
their
income
by
managing
their
farms
better
than
they
were
hitherto
managed
the
farmer
must
not
lose
his
independence
his
initiative
his
rugged
selfreliance
yet
he
must
learn
to
work
in
the
heartiest
cooperation
with
his
fellows
exactly
as
the
business
man
has
learned
to
work
and
he
must
prepare
to
use
to
constantly
better
advantage
the
knowledge
that
can
be
obtained
from
agricultural
colleges
while
he
must
insist
upon
a
practical
curriculum
in
the
schools
in
which
his
children
are
taught
the
department
of
agriculture
and
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
both
deal
with
the
fundamental
needs
of
our
people
in
the
production
of
raw
material
and
its
manufacture
and
distribution
and
therefore
with
the
welfare
of
those
who
produce
it
in
the
raw
state
and
of
those
who
manufacture
and
distribute
it
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
has
but
recently
been
founded
but
has
already
justified
its
existence
while
the
department
of
agriculture
yields
to
no
other
in
the
government
in
the
practical
benefits
which
it
produces
in
proportion
to
the
public
money
expended
it
must
continue
in
the
future
to
deal
with
growing
crops
as
it
has
dealt
in
the
past
but
it
must
still
further
extend
its
field
of
usefulness
hereafter
by
dealing
with
live
men
through
a
farreaching
study
and
treatment
of
the
problems
of
farm
life
alike
from
the
industrial
and
economic
and
social
standpoint
farmers
must
cooperate
with
one
another
and
with
the
government
and
the
government
can
best
give
its
aid
through
associations
of
farmers
so
as
to
deliver
to
the
farmer
the
large
body
of
agricultural
knowledge
which
has
been
accumulated
by
the
national
and
state
governments
and
by
the
agricultural
colleges
and
schools
the
grain
producing
industry
of
the
country
one
of
the
most
important
in
the
united
states
deserves
special
consideration
at
the
hands
of
the
congress
our
grain
is
sold
almost
exclusively
by
grades
to
secure
satisfactory
results
in
our
home
markets
and
to
facilitate
our
trade
abroad
these
grades
should
approximate
the
highest
degree
of
uniformity
and
certainty
the
present
diverse
methods
of
inspection
and
grading
throughout
the
country
under
different
laws
and
boards
result
in
confusion
and
lack
of
uniformity
destroying
that
confidence
which
is
necessary
for
healthful
trade
complaints
against
the
present
methods
have
continued
for
years
and
they
are
growing
in
volume
and
intensity
not
only
in
this
country
but
abroad
i
therefore
suggest
to
the
congress
the
advisability
of
a
national
system
of
inspection
and
grading
of
grain
entering
into
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
as
a
remedy
for
the
present
evils
the
conservation
of
our
natural
resources
and
their
proper
use
constitute
the
fundamental
problem
which
underlies
almost
every
other
problem
of
our
national
life
we
must
maintain
for
our
civilization
the
adequate
material
basis
without
which
that
civilization
can
not
exist
we
must
show
foresight
we
must
look
ahead
as
a
nation
we
not
only
enjoy
a
wonderful
measure
of
present
prosperity
but
if
this
prosperity
is
used
aright
it
is
an
earnest
of
future
success
such
as
no
other
nation
will
have
the
reward
of
foresight
for
this
nation
is
great
and
easily
foretold
but
there
must
be
the
look
ahead
there
must
be
a
realization
of
the
fact
that
to
waste
to
destroy
our
natural
resources
to
skin
and
exhaust
the
land
instead
of
using
it
so
as
to
increase
its
usefulness
will
result
in
undermining
in
the
days
of
our
children
the
very
prosperity
which
we
ought
by
right
to
hand
down
to
them
amplified
and
developed
for
the
last
few
years
through
several
agencies
the
government
has
been
endeavoring
to
get
our
people
to
look
ahead
and
to
substitute
a
planned
and
orderly
development
of
our
resources
in
place
of
a
haphazard
striving
for
immediate
profit
our
great
river
systems
should
be
developed
as
national
water
highways
the
mississippi
with
its
tributaries
standing
first
in
importance
and
the
columbia
second
although
there
are
many
others
of
importance
on
the
pacific
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
slopes
the
national
government
should
undertake
this
work
and
i
hope
a
beginning
will
be
made
in
the
present
congress
and
the
greatest
of
all
our
rivers
the
mississippi
should
receive
especial
attention
from
the
great
lakes
to
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
there
should
be
a
deep
waterway
with
deep
waterways
leading
from
it
to
the
east
and
the
west
such
a
waterway
would
practically
mean
the
extension
of
our
coast
line
into
the
very
heart
of
our
country
it
would
be
of
incalculable
benefit
to
our
people
if
begun
at
once
it
can
be
carried
through
in
time
appreciably
to
relieve
the
congestion
of
our
great
freightcarrying
lines
of
railroads
the
work
should
be
systematically
and
continuously
carried
forward
in
accordance
with
some
wellconceived
plan
the
main
streams
should
be
improved
to
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
before
the
improvement
of
the
branches
is
attempted
and
the
work
should
be
kept
free
from
every
faint
of
recklessness
or
jobbery
the
inland
waterways
which
lie
just
back
of
the
whole
eastern

and
southern
coasts
should
likewise
be
developed
moreover
the
development
of
our
waterways
involves
many
other
important
water
problems
all
of
which
should
be
considered
as
part
of
the
same
general
scheme
the
government
dams
should
be
used
to
produce
hundreds
of
thousands
of
horsepower
as
an
incident
to
improving
navigation
for
the
annual
value
of
the
unused
waterpower
of
the
united
states
perhaps
exceeds
the
annual
value
of
the
products
of
all
our
mines
as
an
incident
to
creating
the
deep
waterways
down
the
mississippi
the
government
should
build
along
its
whole
lower
length
levees
which
taken
together
with
the
control
of
the
headwaters
will
at
once
and
forever
put
a
complete
stop
to
all
threat
of
floods
in
the
immensely
fertile
delta
region
the
territory
lying
adjacent
to
the
mississippi
along
its
lower
course
will
thereby
become
one
of
the
most
prosperous
and
populous
as
it
already
is
one
of
the
most
fertile
farming
regions
in
all
the
world
i
have
appointed
an
inland
waterways
commission
to
study
and
outline
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
development
along
all
the
lines
indicated
later
i
shall
lay
its
report
before
the
congress
irrigation
should
be
far
more
extensively
developed
than
at
present
not
only
in
the
states
of
the
great
plains
and
the
rocky
mountains
but
in
many
others
as
for
instance
in
large
portions
of
the
south
atlantic
and
gulf
states
where
it
should
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
reclamation
of
swamp
land
the
federal
government
should
seriously
devote
itself
to
this
task
realizing
that
utilization
of
waterways
and
waterpower
forestry
irrigation
and
the
reclamation
of
lands
threatened
with
overflow
are
all
interdependent
parts
of
the
same
problem
the
work
of
the
reclamation
service
in
developing
the
larger
opportunities
of
the
western
half
of
our
country
for
irrigation
is
more
important
than
almost
any
other
movement
the
constant
purpose
of
the
government
in
connection
with
the
reclamation
service
has
been
to
use
the
water
resources
of
the
public
lands
for
the
ultimate
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
in
other
words
to
put
upon
the
land
permanent
homemakers
to
use
and
develop
it
for
themselves
and
for
their
children
and
childrens
children
there
has
been
of
course
opposition
to
this
work
opposition
from
some
interested
men
who
desire
to
exhaust
the
land
for
their
own
immediate
profit
without
regard
to
the
welfare
of
the
next
generation
and
opposition
from
honest
and
wellmeaning
men
who
did
not
fully
understand
the
subject
or
who
did
not
look
far
enough
ahead
this
opposition
is
i
think
dying
away
and
our
people
are
understanding
that
it
would
be
utterly
wrong
to
allow
a
few
individuals
to
exhaust
for
their
own
temporary
personal
profit
the
resources
which
ought
to
be
developed
through
use
so
as
to
be
conserved
for
the
permanent
common
advantage
of
the
people
as
a
whole
the
effort
of
the
government
to
deal
with
the
public
land
has
been
based
upon
the
same
principle
as
that
of
the
reclamation
service
the
land
law
system
which
was
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
fertile
and
wellwatered
regions
of
the
middle
west
has
largely
broken
down
when
applied
to
the
dryer
regions
of
the
great
plains
the
mountains
and
much
of
the
pacific
slope
where
a
farm
of
acres
is
inadequate
for
selfsupport
in
these
regions
the
system
lent
itself
to
fraud
and
much
land
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
the
government
without
passing
into
the
hands
of
the
homemaker
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
department
of
justice
joined
in
prosecuting
the
offenders
against
the
law
and
they
have
accomplished
much
while
where
the
administration
of
the
law
has
been
defective
it
has
been
changed
but
the
laws
themselves
are
defective
three
years
ago
a
public
lands
commission
was
appointed
to
scrutinize
the
law
and
defects
and
recommend
a
remedy
their
examination
specifically
showed
the
existence
of
great
fraud
upon
the
public
domain
and
their
recommendations
for
changes
in
the
law
were
made
with
the
design
of
conserving
the
natural
resources
of
every
part
of
the
public
lands
by
putting
it
to
its
best
use
especial
attention
was
called
to
the
prevention
of
settlement
by
the
passage
of
great
areas
of
public
land
into
the
hands
of
a
few
men
and
to
the
enormous
waste
caused
by
unrestricted
grazing
upon
the
open
range
the
recommendations
of
the
public
lands
commission
are
sound
for
they
are
especially
in
the
interest
of
the
actual
homemaker
and
where
the
small
homemaker
can
not
at
present
utilize
the
land
they
provide
that
the
government
shall
keep
control
of
it
so
that
it
may
not
be
monopolized
by
a
few
men
the
congress
has
not
yet
acted
upon
these
recommendations
but
they
are
so
just
and
proper
so
essential
to
our
national
welfare
that
i
feel
confident
if
the
congress
will
take
time
to
consider
them
that
they
will
ultimately
be
adopted
some
such
legislation
as
that
proposed
is
essential
in
order
to
preserve
the
great
stretches
of
public
grazing
land
which
are
unfit
for
cultivation
under
present
methods
and
are
valuable
only
for
the
forage
which
they
supply
these
stretches
amount
in
all
to
some
acres
and
are
open
to
the
free
grazing
of
cattle
sheep
horses
and
goats
without
restriction
such
a
system
or
lack
of
system
means
that
the
range
is
not
so
much
used
as
wasted
by
abuse
as
the
west
settles
the
range
becomes
more
and
more
overgrazed
much
of
it
can
not
be
used
to
advantage
unless
it
is
fenced
for
fencing
is
the
only
way
by
which
to
keep
in
check
the
owners
of
nomad
flocks
which
roam
hither
and
thither
utterly
destroying
the
pastures
and
leaving
a
waste
behind
so
that
their
presence
is
incompatible
with
the
presence
of
homemakers
the
existing
fences
are
all
illegal
some
of
them
represent
the
improper
exclusion
of
actual
settlers
actual
homemakers
from
territory
which
is
usurped
by
great
cattle
companies
some
of
them
represent
what
is
in
itself
a
proper
effort
to
use
the
range
for
those
upon
the
land
and
to
prevent
its
use
by
nomadic
outsiders
all
these
fences
those
that
are
hurtful
and
those
that
are
beneficial
are
alike
illegal
and
must
come
down
but
it
is
an
outrage
that
the
law
should
necessitate
such
action
on
the
part
of
the
administration
the
unlawful
fencing
of
public
lands
for
private
grazing
must
be
stopped
but
the
necessity
which
occasioned
it
must
be
provided
for
the
federal
government
should
have
control
of
the
range
whether
by
permit
or
lease
as
local
necessities
may
determine
such
control
could
secure
the
great
benefit
of
legitimate
fencing
while
at
the
same
time
securing
and
promoting
the
settlement
of
the
country
in
some
places
it
may
be
that
the
tracts
of
range
adjacent
to
the
homesteads
of
actual
settlers
should
be
allotted
to
them
severally
or
in
common
for
the
summer
grazing
of
their
stock
elsewhere
it
may
be
that
a
lease
system
would
serve
the
purpose
the
leases
to
be
temporary
and
subject
to
the
rights
of
settlement
and
the
amount
charged
being
large
enough
merely
to
permit
of
the
efficient
and
beneficial
control
of
the
range
by
the
government
and
of
the
payment
to
the
county
of
the
equivalent
of
what
it
would
otherwise
receive
in
taxes
the
destruction
of
the
public
range
will
continue
until
some
such
laws
as
these
are
enacted
fully
to
prevent
the
fraud
in
the
public
lands
which
through
the
joint
action
of
the
interior
department
and
the
department
of
justice
we
have
been
endeavoring
to
prevent
there
must
be
further
legislation
and
especially
a
sufficient
appropriation
to
permit
the
department
of
the
interior
to
examine
certain
classes
of
entries
on
the
ground
before
they
pass
into
private
ownership
the
government
should
part
with
its
title
only
to
the
actual
homemaker
not
to
the
profitmaker
who
does
not
care
to
make
a
home
our
prime
object
is
to
secure
the
rights
and
guard
the
interests
of
the
small
ranchman
the
man
who
plows
and
pitches
hay
for
himself
it
is
this
small
ranchman
this
actual
settler
and
homemaker
who
in
the
long
run
is
most
hurt
by
permitting
thefts
of
the
public
land
in
whatever
form
optimism
is
a
good
characteristic
but
if
carried
to
an
excess
it
becomes
foolishness
we
are
prone
to
speak
of
the
resources
of
this
country
as
inexhaustible
this
is
not
so
the
mineral
wealth
of
the
country
the
coal
iron
oil
gas
and
the
like
does
not
reproduce
itself
and
therefore
is
certain
to
be
exhausted
ultimately
and
wastefulness
in
dealing
with
it
today
means
that
our
descendants
will
feel
the
exhaustion
a
generation
or
two
before
they
otherwise
would
but
there
are
certain
other
forms
of
waste
which
could
be
entirely
stoppedthe
waste
of
soil
by
washing
for
instance
which
is
among
the
most
dangerous
of
all
wastes
now
in
progress
in
the
united
states
is
easily
preventable
so
that
this
present
enormous
loss
of
fertility
is
entirely
unnecessary
the
preservation
or
replacement
of
the
forests
is
one
of
the
most
important
means
of
preventing
this
loss
we
have
made
a
beginning
in
forest
preservation
but
it
is
only
a
beginning
at
present
lumbering
is
the
fourth
greatest
industry
in
the
united
states
and
yet
so
rapid
has
been
the
rate
of
exhaustion
of
timber
in
the
united
states
in
the
past
and
so
rapidly
is
the
remainder
being
exhausted
that
the
country
is
unquestionably
on
the
verge
of
a
timber
famine
which
will
be
felt
in
every
household
in
the
land
there
has
already
been
a
rise
in
the
price
of
lumber
but
there
is
certain
to
be
a
more
rapid
and
heavier
rise
in
the
future
the
present
annual
consumption
of
lumber
is
certainly
three
times
as
great
as
the
annual
growth
and
if
the
consumption
and
growth
continue
unchanged
practically
all
our
lumber
will
be
exhausted
in
another
generation
while
long
before
the
limit
to
complete
exhaustion
is
reached
the
growing
scarcity
will
make
itself
felt
in
many
blighting
ways
upon
our
national
welfare
about
per
cent
of
our
forested
territory
is
now
reserved
in
national
forests
but
these
do
not
include
the
most
valuable
timber
lauds
and
in
any
event
the
proportion
is
too
small
to
expect
that
the
reserves
can
accomplish
more
than
a
mitigation
of
the
trouble
which
is
ahead
for
the
nation
far
more
dr
astic
action
is
needed
forests
can
be
lumbered
so
as
to
give
to
the
public
the
full
use
of
their
mercantile
timber
without
the
slightest
detriment
to
the
forest
any
more
than
it
is
a
detriment
to
a
farm
to
furnish
a
harvest
so
that
there
is
no
parallel
between
forests
and
mines
which
can
only
be
completely
used
by
exhaustion
but
forests
if
used
as
all
our
forests
have
been
used
in
the
past
and
as
most
of
them
are
still
used
will
be
either
wholly
destroyed
or
so
damaged
that
many
decades
have
to
pass
before
effective
use
can
be
made
of
them
again
all
these
facts
are
so
obvious
that
it
is
extraordinary
that
it
should
be
necessary
to
repeat
them
every
business
man
in
the
land
every
writer
in
the
newspapers
every
man
or
woman
of
an
ordinary
school
education
ought
to
be
able
to
see
that
immense
quantities
of
timber
are
used
in
the
country
that
the
forests
which
supply
this
timber
are
rapidly
being
exhausted
and
that
if
no
change
takes
place
exhaustion
will
come
comparatively
soon
and
that
the
effects
of
it
will
be
felt
severely
in
the
everyday
life
of
our
people
surely
when
these
facts
are
so
obvious
there
should
be
no
delay
in
taking
preventive
measures
yet
we
seem
as
a
nation
to
be
willing
to
proceed
in
this
matter
with
happygolucky
indifference
even
to
the
immediate
future
it
is
this
attitude
which
permits
the
selfinterest
of
a
very
few
persons
to
weigh
for
more
than
the
ultimate
interest
of
all
our
people
there
are
persons
who
find
it
to
their
immense
pecuniary
benefit
to
destroy
the
forests
by
lumbering
they
are
to
be
blamed
for
thus
sacrificing
the
future
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
to
their
own
selfinterest
of
the
moment
but
heavier
blame
attaches
to
the
people
at
large
for
permitting
such
action
whether
in
the
white
mountains
in
the
southern
alleghenies
or
in
the
rockies
and
sierras
a
big
lumbering
company
impatient
for
immediate
returns
and
not
caring
to
look
far
enough
ahead
will
often
deliberately
destroy
all
the
good
timber
in
a
region
hoping
afterwards
to
move
on
to
some
new
country
the
shiftless
man
of
small
means
who
does
not
care
to
become
an
actual
homemaker
but
would
like
immediate
profit
will
find
it
to
his
advantage
to
take
up
timber
land
simply
to
turn
it
over
to
such
a
big
company
and
leave
it
valueless
for
future
settlers
a
big
mine
owner
anxious
only
to
develop
his
mine
at
the
moment
will
care
only
to
cut
all
the
timber
that
he
wishes
without
regard
to
the
futureprobably
net
looking
ahead
to
the
condition
of
the
country
when
the
forests
are
exhausted
any
more
than
he
does
to
the
condition
when
the
mine
is
worked
out
i
do
not
blame
these
men
nearly
as
much
as
i
blame
the
supine
public
opinion
the
indifferent
public
opinion
which
permits
their
action
to
go
unchecked
of
course
to
check
the
waste
of
timber
means
that
there
must
be
on
the
part
of
the
public
the
acceptance
of
a
temporary
restriction
in
the
lavish
use
of
the
timber
in
order
to
prevent
the
total
loss
of
this
use
in
the
future
there
are
plenty
of
men
in
public
and
private
life
who
actually
advocate
the
continuance
of
the
present
system
of
unchecked
and
wasteful
extravagance
using
as
an
argument
the
fact
that
to
check
it
will
of
course
mean
interference
with
the
ease
and
comfort
of
certain
people
who
now
get
lumber
at
less
cost
than
they
ought
to
pay
at
the
expense
of
the
future
generations
some
of
these
persons
actually
demand
that
the
present
forest
reserves
be
thrown
open
to
destruction
because
forsooth
they
think
that
thereby
the
price
of
lumber
could
be
put
down
again
for
two
or
three
or
more
years
their
attitude
is
precisely
like
that
of
an
agitator
protesting
against
the
outlay
of
money
by
farmers
on
manure
and
in
taking
care
of
their
farms
generally
undoubtedly
if
the
average
farmer
were
content
absolutely
to
ruin
his
farm
he
could
for
two
or
three
years
avoid
spending
any
money
on
it
and
yet
make
a
good
deal
of
money
out
of
it
but
only
a
savage
would
in
his
private
affairs
show
such
reckless
disregard
of
the
future
yet
it
is
precisely
this
reckless
disregard
of
the
future
which
the
opponents
of
the
forestry
system
are
now
endeavoring
to
get
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
show
the
only
trouble
with
the
movement
for
the
preservation
of
our
forests
is
that
it
has
not
gone
nearly
far
enough
and
was
not
begun
soon
enough
it
is
a
most
fortunate
thing
however
that
we
began
it
when
we
did
we
should
acquire
in
the
appalachian
and
white
mountain
regions
all
the
forest
lands
that
it
is
possible
to
acquire
for
the
use
of
the
nation
these
lands
because
they
form
a
national
asset
are
as
emphatically
national
as
the
rivers
which
they
feed
and
which
flow
through
so
many
states
before
they
reach
the
ocean
there
should
be
no
tariff
on
any
forest
product
grown
in
this
country
and
in
especial
there
should
be
no
tariff
on
wood
pulp
due
notice
of
the
change
being
of
course
given
to
those
engaged
in
the
business
so
as
to
enable
them
to
adjust
themselves
to
the
new
conditions
the
repeal
of
the
duty
on
wood
pulp
should
if
possible
be
accompanied
by
an
agreement
with
canada
that
there
shall
be
no
export
duty
on
canadian
pulp
wood
in
the
eastern
united
states
the
mineral
fuels
have
already
passed
into
the
hands
of
large
private
owners
and
those
of
the
west
are
rapidly
following
it
is
obvious
that
these
fuels
should
be
conserved
and
not
wasted
and
it
would
be
well
to
protect
the
people
against
unjust
and
extortionate
prices
so
far
as
that
can
still
be
done
what
has
been
accomplished
in
the
great
oil
fields
of
the
indian
territory
by
the
action
of
the
administration
offers
a
striking
example
of
the
good
results
of
such
a
policy
in
my
judgment
the
government
should
have
the
right
to
keep
the
fee
of
the
coal
oil
and
gas
fields
in
its
own
possession
and
to
lease
the
rights
to
develop
them
under
proper
regulations
or
else
if
the
congress
will
not
adopt
this
method
the
coal
deposits
should
be
sold
under
limitations
to
conserve
them
as
public
utilities
the
right
to
mine
coal
being
separated
from
the
title
to
the
soil
the
regulations
should
permit
coal
lands
to
be
worked
in
sufficient
quantity
by
the
several
corporations
the
present
limitations
have
been
absurd
excessive
and
serve
no
useful
purpose
and
often
render
it
necessary
that
there
should
be
either
fraud
or
close
abandonment
of
the
work
of
getting
out
the
coal
work
on
the
panama
canal
is
proceeding
in
a
highly
satisfactory
manner
in
march
last
john

this
change
of
authority
and
direction
went
into
effect
on
april
without
causing
a
perceptible
check
to
the
progress
of
the
work
in
march
the
total
excavation
in
the
culebra
cut
where
effort
was
chiefly
concentrated
was
cubic
yards
in
april
this
was
increased
to
cubic
yards
there
was
a
considerable
decrease
in
the
output
for
may
and
june
owing
partly
to
the
advent
of
the
rainy
season
and
partly
to
temporary
trouble
with

steam

men
over
the
question

this
trouble
was
settled
satisfactorily
to

parties

advanced
materially
and
in

the
grand
total

dredges
exceeded
all
previous
united
states
records
reaching
cubic
yards
in
september
this
record
was
eclipsed
and
a
total
of
cubic
yards
was
removed
of
this
amount
cubic
yards
were
from
the
canal
prism
and
cubic
yards
were
from
accessory
works
these
results
were
achieved
in
the
rainy
season
with
a
rainfall
in
august
of
inches
and
in
september
of
inches
finally
in
october
the
record
was
again
eclipsed
the
total
excavation
being
cubic
yards
a
truly
extraordinary
record
especially
in
view
of
the
heavy
rainfall
which
was
inches
in
fact
experience
during
the
last
two
rainy
seasons
demonstrates
that
the
rains
are
a
less
serious
obstacle
to
progress
than
has
hitherto
been
supposed
work
on
the
locks
and
dams
at
gatun
which
began
actively
in
march
last
has
advanced
so
far
that
it
is
thought
that
masonry
work
on
the
locks
can
be
begun
within
fifteen
months
in
order
to
remove
all
doubt
as
to
the
satisfactory
character
of
the
foundations
for
the
locks
of
the
canal
the
secretary
of
war
requested
three
eminent
civil
engineers
of
special
experience
in
such
construction
alfred
noble
frederic
p
stearns
and
john
r
freeman
to
visit
the
isthmus
and
make
thorough
personal
investigations
of
the
sites
these
gentlemen
went
to
the
isthmus
in
april
and
by
means
of
test
pits
which
had
been
dug
for
the
purpose
they
inspected
the
proposed
foundations
and
also
examined
the
borings
that
had
been
made
in
their
report
to
the
secretary
of
war
under
date
of
may
they
said
we
found
that
all
of
the
locks
of
the
dimensions
now
proposed
will
rest
upon
rock
of
such
character
that
it
will
furnish
a
safe
and
stable
foundation
subsequent
new
borings
conducted
by
the
present
commission
have
fully
confirmed
this
verdict
they
show
that
the
locks
will
rest
on
rock
for
their
entire
length
the
cross
section
of
the
dam
and
method
of
construction
will
be
such
as
to
insure
against
any
slip
or
sloughing
off
similar
examination
of
the
foundations
of
the
locks
and
dams
on
the
pacific
side
are
in
progress
i
believe
that
the
locks
should
be
made
of
a
width
of
feet
last
winter
bids
were
requested
and
received
for
doing
the
work
of
canal
construction
by
contract
none
of
them
was
found
to
be
satisfactory
and
all
were
rejected
it
is
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
present
commission
that
the
work
can
be
done
better
more
cheaply
and
more
quickly
by
the
government
than
by
private
contractors
fully
per
cent
of
the
entire
plant
needed
for
construction
has
been
purchased
or
contracted
for
machine
shops
have
been
erected
and
equipped
for
making
all
needed
repai
rs
to
the
plant
many
thousands
of
employees
have
been
secured
an
effective
organization
has
been
perfected
a
recruiting
system
is
in
operation
which
is
capable
of
furnishing
more
labor
than
can
be
used
advantageously
employees
are
well
sheltered
and
well
fed
salaries
paid
are
satisfactory
and
the
work
is
not
only
going
forward
smoothly
but
it
is
producing
results
far
in
advance
of
the
most
sanguine
anticipations
under
these
favorable
conditions
a
change
in
the
method
of
prosecuting
the
work
would
be
unwise
and
unjustifiable
for
it
would
inevitably
disorganize
existing
conditions
check
progress
and
increase
the
cost
and
lengthen
the
time
of
completing
the
canal
the
chief
engineer
and
all
his
professional
associates
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
feet
level
lock
canal
which
they
are
constructing
is
the
best
that
could
be
desired
some
of
them
had
doubts
on
this
point
when
they
went
to
the
isthmus
as
the
plans
have
developed
under
their
direction
their
doubts
have
been
dispelled
while
they
may
decide
upon
changes
in
detail
as
construction
advances
they
are
in
hearty
accord
in
approving
the
general
plan
they
believe
that
it
provides
a
canal
not
only
adequate
to
all
demands
that
will
be
made
upon
it
but
superior
in
every
way
to
a
sea
level
canal
i
concur
in
this
belief
i
commend
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
a
postal
savings
bank
system
as
recommended
by
the
postmastergeneral
the
primary
object
is
to
encourage
among
our
people
economy
and
thrift
and
by
the
use
of
postal
savings
banks
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
husband
their
resources
particularly
those
who
have
not
the
facilities
at
hand
for
depositing
their
money
in
savings
banks
viewed
however
from
the
experience
of
the
past
few
weeks
it
is
evident
that
the
advantages
of
such
an
institution
are
till
more
farreaching
timid
depositors
have
withdrawn
their
savings
for
the
time
being
from
national
banks
trust
companies
and
savings
banks
individuals
have
hoarded
their
cash
and
the
workingmen
their
earnings
all
of
which
money
has
been
withheld
and
kept
in
hiding
or
in
safe
deposit
box
to
the
detriment
of
prosperity
through
the
agency
of
the
postal
savings
banks
such
money
would
be
restored
to
the
channels
of
trade
to
the
mutual
benefit
of
capital
and
labor
i
further
commend
to
the
congress
the
consideration
of
the
postmastergenerals
recommendation
for
an
extension
of
the
parcel
post
especially
on
the
rural
routes
there
are
now
rural
routes
serving
nearly
people
who
do
not
have
the
advantages
of
the
inhabitants
of
cities
in
obtaining
their
supplies
these
recommendations
have
been
drawn
up
to
benefit
the
farmer
and
the
country
storekeeper
otherwise
i
should
not
favor
them
for
i
believe
that
it
is
good
policy
for
our
government
to
do
everything
possible
to
aid
the
small
town
and
the
country
district
it
is
desirable
that
the
country
merchant
should
not
be
crushed
out
the
fourthclass
postmasters
convention
has
passed
a
very
strong
resolution
in
favor
of
placing
the
fourthclass
postmasters
under
the
civilservice
law
the
administration
has
already
put
into
effect
the
policy
of
refusing
to
remove
any
fourthclass
postmasters
save
for
reasons
connected
with
the
good
of
the
service
and
it
is
endeavoring
so
far
as
possible
to
remove
them
from
the
domain
of
partisan
politics
it
would
be
a
most
desirable
thing
to
put
the
fourthclass
postmasters
in
the
classified
service
it
is
possible
that
this
might
be
done
without
congressional
action
but
as
the
matter
is
debatable
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
congress
enact
a
law
providing
that
they
be
included
under
the
civilservice
law
and
put
in
the
classified
service
oklahoma
has
become
a
state
standing
on
a
full
equality
with
her
elder
sisters
and
her
future
is
assured
by
her
great
natural
resources
the
duty
of
the
national
government
to
guard
the
personal
and
property
rights
of
the
indians
within
her
borders
remains
of
course
unchanged
i
reiterate
my
recommendations
of
last
year
as
regards
alaska
some
form
of
local
selfgovernment
should
be
provided
as
simple
and
inexpensive
as
possible
it
is
impossible
for
the
congress
to
devote
the
necessary
time
to
all
the
little
details
of
necessary
alaskan
legislation
road
building
and
railway
building
should
be
encouraged
the
governor
of
alaska
should
be
given
an
ample
appropriation
wherewith
to
organize
a
force
to
preserve
the
public
peace
whisky
selling
to
the
natives
should
be
made
a
felony
the
coal
land
laws
should
be
changed
so
as
to
meet
the
peculiar
needs
of
the
territory
this
should
be
attended
to
at
once
for
the
present
laws
permit
individuals
to
locate
large
areas
of
the
public
domain
for
speculative
purposes
and
cause
an
immense
amount
of
trouble
fraud
and
litigation
there
should
be
another
judicial
division
established
as
early
as
possible
lighthouses
and
buoys
should
be
established
as
aids
to
navigation
especially
in
and
about
prince
william
sound
and
the
survey
of
the
coast
completed
there
is
need
of
liberal
appropriations
for
lighting
and
buoying
the
southern
coast
and
improving
the
aids
to
navigation
in
southeastern
alaska
one
of
the
great
industries
of
alaska
as
of
puget
sound
and
the
columbia
is
salmon
fishing
gradually
by
reason
of
lack
of
proper
laws
this
industry
is
being
ruined
it
should
now
be
taken
in
charge
and
effectively
protected
by
the
united
states
government
the
courage
and
enterprise
of
the
citizens
of
the
far
northwest
in
their
projected
alaskanyukonpacific
exposition
to
be
held
in
should
receive
liberal
encouragement
this
exposition
is
not
sentimental
in
its
conception
but
seeks
to
exploit
the
natural
resources
of
alaska
and
to
promote
the
commerce
trade
and
industry
of
the
pacific
states
with
their
neighboring
states
and
with
our
insular
possessions
and
the
neighboring
countries
of
the
pacific
the
exposition
asks
no
loan
from
the
congress
but
seeks
appropriations
for
national
exhibits
and
exhibits
of
the
western
dependencies
of
the
general
government
the
state
of
washington
and
the
city
of
seattle
have
shown
the
characteristic
western
enterprise
in
large
donations
for
the
conduct
of
this
exposition
in
which
other
states
are
lending
generous
assistance
the
unfortunate
failure
of
the
shipping
bill
at
the
last
session
of
the
last
congress
was
followed
by
the
taking
off
of
certain
pacific
steamships
which
has
greatly
hampered
the
movement
of
passengers
between
hawaii
and
the
mainland
unless
the
congress
is
prepared
by
positive
encouragement
to
secure
proper
facilities
in
the
way
of
shipping
between
hawaii
and
the
mainland
then
the
coastwise
shipping
laws
should
be
so
far
relaxed
as
to
prevent
hawaii
suffering
as
it
is
now
suffering
i
again
call
your
attention
to
the
capital
importance
from
every
standpoint
of
making
pearl
harbor
available
for
the
largest
deep
water
vessels
and
of
suitably
fortifying
the
island
the
secretary
of
war
has
gone
to
the
philippines
on
his
return
i
shall
submit
to
you
his
report
on
the
islands
i
again
recommend
that
the
rights
of
citizenship
be
conferred
upon
the
people
of
porto
rico
a
bureau
of
mines
should
be
created
under
the
control
and
direction
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
bureau
to
have
power
to
collect
statistics
and
make
investigations
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
mining
and
particularly
to
the
accidents
and
dangers
of
the
industry
if
this
can
not
now
be
done
at
least
additional
appropriations
should
be
given
the
interior
department
to
be
used
for
the
study
of
mining
conditions
for
the
prevention
of
fraudulent
mining
schemes
for
carrying
on
the
work
of
mapping
the
mining
districts
for
studying
methods
for
minimizing
the
accidents
and
dangers
in
the
industry
in
short
to
aid
in
all
proper
ways
the
development
of
the
mining
industry
i
strongly
recommend
to
the
congress
to
provide
funds
for
keeping
up
the
hermitage
the
home
of
andrew
jackson
these
funds
to
be
used
through
the
existing
hermitage
association
for
the
preservation
of
a
historic
building
which
should
ever
be
dear
to
americans
i
further
recommend
that
a
naval
monument
be
established
in
the
vicksburg
national
park
this
national
park
gives
a
unique
opportunity
for
commemorating
the
deeds
of
those
gallant
men
who
fought
on
water
no
less
than
of
those
who
fought
on
land
in
the
great
civil
war
legislation
should
be
enacted
at
the
present
session
of
the
congress
for
the
thirteenth
census
the
establishment
of
the
permanent
census
bureau
affords
the
opportunity
for
a
better
census
than
we
have
ever
had
but
in
order
to
realize
the
full
advantage
of
the
permanent
organization
ample
time
must
be
given
for
preparation
there
is
a
constantly
growing
interest
in
this
country
in
the
question
of
the
public
health
at
last
the
public
mind
is
awake
to
the
fact
that
many
diseases
notably
tuberculosis
are
national
scourges
the
work
of
the
state
and
city
boards
of
health
should
be
supplemented
by
a
constantly
increasing
interest
on
the
part
of
the
national
government
the
congress
has
already
provided
a
bureau
of
public
health
and
has
provided
for
a
hygienic
laboratory
there
are
other
valuable
laws
relating
to
the
public
health
connected
with
the
various
departments
this
whole
branch
of
the
government
should
be
strengthened
and
aided
in
every
way
i
call
attention
to
two
government
commissions
which
i
have
appointed
and
which
have
already
done
excellent
work
the
first
of
these
has
to
do
with
the
organization
of
the
scientific
work
of
the
government
which
has
grown
up
wholly
without
plan
and
is
in
consequence
so
unwisely
distributed
among
the
executive
departments
that
much
of
its
effect
is
lost
for
the
lack
of
proper
coordination
this
commissions
chief
object
is
to
introduce
a
planned
and
orderly
development
and
operation
in
the
place
of
the
illassorted
and
often
ineffective
grouping
and
methods
of
work
which
have
prevailed
this
can
not
be
done
without
legislation
nor
would
it
be
feasible
to
deal
in
detail
with
so
complex
an
administrative
problem
by
specific
provisions
of
law
i
recommend
that
the
president
be
given
authority
to
concentrate
related
lines
of
work
and
reduce
d
uplication
by
executive
order
through
transfer
and
consolidation
of
lines
of
work
the
second
committee
that
on
department
methods
was
instructed
to
investigate
and
report
upon
the
changes
needed
to
place
the
conduct
of
the
executive
force
of
the
government
on
the
most
economical
and
effective
basis
in
the
light
of
the
best
modern
business
practice
the
committee
has
made
very
satisfactory
progress
antiquated
practices
and
bureaucratic
ways
have
been
abolished
and
a
general
renovation
of
departmental
methods
has
been
inaugurated
all
that
can
be
done
by
executive
order
has
already
been
accomplished
or
will
be
put
into
effect
in
the
near
future
the
work
of
the
main
committee
and
its
several
assistant
committees
has
produced
a
wholesome
awakening
on
the
part
of
the
great
body
of
officers
and
employees
engaged
in
government
work
in
nearly
every
department
and
office
there
has
been
a
careful
selfinspection
for
the
purpose
of
remedying
any
defects
before
they
could
be
made
the
subject
of
adverse
criticism
this
has
led
individuals
to
a
wider
study
of
the
work
on
which
they
were
engaged
and
this
study
has
resulted
in
increasing
their
efficiency
in
their
respective
lines
of
work
there
are
recommendations
of
special
importance
from
the
committee
on
the
subject
of
personnel
and
the
classification
of
salaries
which
will
require
legislative
action
before
they
can
be
put
into
effect
it
is
my
intention
to
submit
to
the
congress
in
the
near
future
a
special
message
on
those
subjects
under
our
form
of
government
voting
is
not
merely
a
right
but
a
duty
and
moreover
a
fundamental
and
necessary
duty
if
a
man
is
to
be
a
good
citizen
it
is
well
to
provide
that
corporations
shall
not
contribute
to
presidential
or
national
campaigns
and
furthermore
to
provide
for
the
publication
of
both
contributions
and
expenditures
there
is
however
always
danger
in
laws
of
this
kind
which
from
their
very
nature
are
difficult
of
enforcement
the
danger
being
lest
they
be
obeyed
only
by
the
honest
and
disobeyed
by
the
unscrupulous
so
as
to
act
only
as
a
penalty
upon
honest
men
moreover
no
such
law
would
hamper
an
unscrupulous
man
of
unlimited
means
from
buying
his
own
way
into
office
there
is
a
very
radical
measure
which
would
i
believe
work
a
substantial
improvement
in
our
system
of
conducting
a
campaign
although
i
am
well
aware
that
it
will
take
some
time
for
people
so
to
familiarize
themselves
with
such
a
proposal
as
to
be
willing
to
consider
its
adoption
the
need
for
collecting
large
campaign
funds
would
vanish
if
congress
provided
an
appropriation
for
the
proper
and
legitimate
expenses
of
each
of
the
great
national
parties
an
appropriation
ample
enough
to
meet
the
necessity
for
thorough
organization
and
machinery
which
requires
a
large
expenditure
of
money
then
the
stipulation
should
be
made
that
no
party
receiving
campaign
funds
from
the
treasury
should
accept
more
than
a
fixed
amount
from
any
individual
subscriber
or
donor
and
the
necessary
publicity
for
receipts
and
expenditures
could
without
difficulty
be
provided
there
should
be
a
national
gallery
of
art
established
in
the
capital
city
of
this
country
this
is
important
not
merely
to
the
artistic
but
to
the
material
welfare
of
the
country
and
the
people
are
to
be
congratulated
on
the
fact
that
the
movement
to
establish
such
a
gallery
is
taking
definite
form
under
the
guidance
of
the
smithsonian
institution
so
far
from
there
being
a
tariff
on
works
of
art
brought
into
the
country
their
importation
should
be
encouraged
in
every
way
there
have
been
no
sufficient
collections
of
objects

the

is
quietly
working
for
the
good
of
our
agricultural
interests
and
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
government
bureau
which
conducts
original
scientific
research
the
findings
of
which
are
of
much
practical
utility
for
more
than
twenty
years
it
has
studied
the
food
habits
of
birds
and
mammals
that
are
injurious
or
beneficial
to
agriculture
horticulture

has
distributed
illustrated

has
ascertained
and
gives
wide
publicity
to
the
fact
that
at

kinds

upon
this
destructive

it
has
discovered
that
species
of

enemies
of

it
has
shown
that
woodpeckers
as
a
class
by
destroying
the
larvae
of
woodboring
insects
are
so
essential
to
tree
life
that
it
is
doubtful
if
our
forests
could
exist
without
them
it
has
shown
that
cuckoos
and

are
the
natural
enemies
of
the
leafeating

that
destroy
our
shade
and

trees
that
our

consume
annually
hundreds

that
hawks

in
an

inaugurated

of
which
the

keeping

has
shown
how

may
be
made
to
yield
a
large

to

revenue
amounting
in
the
case
of
illinois
to
in
a
single

the
biological
survey
has
explored
the
faunas
and
floras
of
america
with
reference
to
the
distribution
of
animals
and
plants
it
has
defined
and
mapped
the
natural
life
areasareas
in
which
by
reason
of
prevailing
climatic
conditions
certain
kinds
of
animals
and
plants
occurand
has
pointed
out
the
adaptability
of
these
areas
to
the
cultivation
of
particular
crops
the
results
of
these
investigations
are
not
only
of
high
educational
value
but
are
worth
each
year
to
the
progressive
farmers
of
the
country
many
times
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
survey
which
it
may
be
added
is
exceedingly
small
i
recommend
to
congress
that
this
bureau
whose
usefulness
is
seriously
handicapped
by
lack
of
funds
be
granted
an
appropriation
in
some
degree
commensurate
with
the
importance
of
the
work
it
is
doing
i
call
your
especial
attention
to
the
unsatisfactory
condition
of
our
foreign
mail
service
which
because
of
the
lack
of
american
steamship
lines
is
now
largely
done
through
foreign
lines
and
which
particularly
so
far
as
south
and
central
america
are
concerned
is
done
in
a
manner
which
constitutes
a
serious
barrier
to
the
extension
of
our
commerce
the
time
has
come
in
my
judgment
to
set
to
work
seriously
to
make
our
ocean
mail
service
correspond
more
closely
with
our
recent
commercial
and
political
development
a
beginning
was
made
by
the
ocean
mail
act
of
march
but
even
at
that
time
the
act
was
known
to
be
inadequate
in
various
particulars
since
that
time
events
have
moved
rapidly
in
our
history
we
have
acquired
hawaii
the
philippines
and
lesser
islands
in
the
pacific
we
are
steadily
prosecuting
the
great
work
of
uniting
at
the
isthmus
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
to
a
greater
extent
than
seemed
probable
even
a
dozen
years
ago
we
may
look
to
an
american
future
on
the
sea
worthy
of
the
traditions
of
our
past
as
the
first
step
in
that
direction
and
the
step
most
feasible
at
the
present
time
i
recommend
the
extension
of
the
ocean
mail
act
of
this
act
has
stood
for
some
years
free
from
successful
criticism
of
its
principle
and
purpose
it
was
based
on
theories
of
the
obligations
of
a
great
maritime
nation
undisputed
in
our
own
land
and
followed
by
other
nations
since
the
beginning
of
steam
navigation
briefly
those
theories
are
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
firstclass
power
so
far
as
practicable
to
carry
its
ocean
mails
under
its
own
flag
that
the
fast
ocean
steamships
and
their
crews
required
for
such
mail
service
are
valuable
auxiliaries
to
the
sea
power
of
a
nation
furthermore
the
construction
of
such
steamships
insures
the
maintenance
in
an
efficient
condition
of
the
shipyards
in
which
our
battleships
must
be
built
the
expenditure
of
public
money
for
the
performance
of
such
necessary
functions
of
government
is
certainly
warranted
nor
is
it
necessary
to
dwell
upon
the
incidental
benefits
to
our
foreign
commerce
to
the
shipbuilding
industry
and
to
ship
owning
and
navigation
which
will
accompany
the
discharge
of
these
urgent
public
duties
though
they
too
should
have
weight
the
only
serious
question
is
whether
at
this
time
we
can
afford
to
improve
our
ocean
mail
service
as
it
should
be
improved
all
doubt
on
this
subject
is
removed
by
the
reports
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
that
department
estimates
that
the
postage
collected
on
the
articles
exchanged
with
foreign
countries
other
than
canada
and
mexico
amounted
to
or
more
than
the
net
cost
of
the
service
exclusive
of
the
cost
of
transporting
the
articles
between
the
united
states
exchange
postoff
ices
and
the
united
states
postoffices
at
which
they
were
mailed
or
delivered
in
other
words
the
government
of
the
united
states
having
assumed
a
monopoly
of
carrying
the
mails
for
the
people
making
a
profit
of
over
by
rendering
a
cheap
and
inefficient
service
that
profit
i
believe
should
be
devoted
to
strengthening
maritime
power
in
those
directions
where
it
will
best
promote
our
prestige
the
country
is
familiar
with
the
facts
of
our
maritime
impotence
in
the
harbors
of
the
great
and
friendly
republics
of
south
america
following
the
failure
of
the
shipbuilding
bill
we
lost
our
only
american
line
of
steamers
to
australasia
and
that
loss
on
the
pacific
has
become
a
serious
embarrassment
to
the
people
of
hawaii
and
has
wholly
cut
off
the
samoan
islands
from
regular
communication
with
the
pacific
coast
puget
sound
in
the
year
has
lost
over
half
four
out
of
seven
of
its
american
steamers
trading
with
the
orient
we
now
pay
under
the
act
of
a
statute
mile
outward
to
knot
american
mail
steamships
built
according
to
naval
plans
available
as
cruisers
and
manned
by
americans
steamships
of
that
speed
are
confined
exclusively
to
transatlantic
trade
with
new
york
to
steamships
of
knots
or
over
only
a
mile
can
be
paid
and
it
is
steamships
of
this
speed
and
type
which
are
needed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
mail
service
to
south
america
asia
including
the
philippines
and
australia
i
strongly
recommend
therefore
a
simple
amendment
to
the
ocean
mail
act
of
which
shall
authorize
the
postmastergeneral
in
his
discretion
to
enter
into
contracts
for
the
transportation
of
mails
to
the
republics
of
south
america
to
asia
the
philippines
and
australia
at
a
rate
not
to
exceed
a
mile
for
steamships
of
knots
speed
or
upwards
subject
to
the
restrictions
and
obligations
of
the
act
of
the
profit
of
which
has
been
mentioned
will
fully
cover
the
maximum
annual
expenditure
involved
in
this
recommendation
and
it
is
believed
will
in
time
establish
the
lines
so
urgently
needed
the
proposition
involves
no
new
principle
but
permits
the
efficient
discharge
of
public
functions
now
inadequately
performed
or
not
performed
at
all
not
only
there
is
not
now
but
there
never
has
been
any
other
nation
in
the
world
so
wholly
free
from
the
evils
of
militarism
as
is
ours
there
never
has
been
any
other
large
nation
not
even
china
which
for
so
long
a
period
has
had
relatively
to
its
numbers
so
small
a
regular
army
as
has
ours
never
at
any
time
in
our
history
has
this
nation
suffered
from
militarism
or
been
in
the
remotest
danger
of
suffering
from
militarism
never
at
any
time
of
our
history
has
the
regular
army
been
of
a
size
which
caused
the
slightest
appreciable
tax
upon
the
taxpaying
citizens
of
the
nation
almost
always
it
has
been
too
small
in
size
and
underpaid
never
in
our
entire
history
has
the
nation
suffered
in
the
least
particular
because
too
much
care
has
been
given
to
the
army
too
much
prominence
given
it
too
much
money
spent
upon
it
or
because
it
has
been
too
large
but
again
and
again
we
have
suffered
because
enough
care
has
not
been
given
to
it
because
it
has
been
too
small
because
there
has
not
been
sufficient
preparation
in
advance
for
possible
war
every
foreign
war
in
which
we
have
engaged
has
cost
us
many
times
the
amount
which
if
wisely
expended
during
the
preceding
years
of
peace
on
the
regular
army
would
have
insured
the
war
ending
in
but
a
fraction
of
the
time
and
but
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
that
was
actually
the
case
as
a
nation
we
have
always
been
shortsighted
in
providing
for
the
efficiency
of
the
army
in
time
of
peace
it
is
nobodys
especial
interest
to
make
such
provision
and
no
one
looks
ahead
to
war
at
any
period
no
matter
how
remote
as
being
a
serious
possibility
while
an
improper
economy
or
rather
niggardliness
can
be
practiced
at
the
expense
of
the
army
with
the
certainty
that
those
practicing
it
will
not
be
called
to
account
therefor
but
that
the
price
will
be
paid
by
the
unfortunate
persons
who
happen
to
be
in
office
when
a
war
does
actually
come
i
think
it
is
only
lack
of
foresight
that
troubles
us
not
any
hostility
to
the
army
there
are
of
course
foolish
people
who
denounce
any
care
of
the
army
or
navy
as
militarism
but
i
do
not
think
that
these
people
are
numerous
this
country
has
to
contend
now
and
has
had
to
contend
in
the
past
with
many
evils
and
there
is
ample
scope
for
all
who
would
work
for
reform
but
there
is
not
one
evil
that
now
exists
or
that
ever
has
existed
in
this
country
which
is
or
ever
has
been
owing
in
the
smallest
part
to
militarism
declamation
against
militarism
has
no
more
serious
place
in
an
earnest
and
intelligent
movement
for
righteousness
in
this
country
than
declamation
against
the
worship
of
baal
or
astaroth
it
is
declamation
against
a
nonexistent
evil
one
which
never
has
existed
in
this
country
and
which
has
not
the
slightest
chance
of
appearing
here
we
are
glad
to
help
in
any
movement
for
international
peace
but
this
is
because
we
sincerely
believe
that
it
is
our
duty
to
help
all
such
movements
provided
they
are
sane
and
rational
and
not
because
there
is
any
tendency
toward
militarism
on
our
part
which
needs
to
be
cured
the
evils
we
have
to
fight
are
those
in
connection
with
industrialism
not
militarism
industry
is
always
necessary
just
as
war
is
sometimes
necessary
each
has
its
price
and
industry
in
the
united
states
now
exacts
and
has
always
exacted
a
far
heavier
toll
of
death
than
all
our
wars
put
together
the
statistics
of
the
railroads
of
this
country
for
the
year
ended
june
the
last
contained
in
the
annual
statistical
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
show
in
that
one
year
a
total
of
casualties
to
persons
of
which
represent
the
number
of
persons
killed
in
that
wonderful
hive
of
human
activity
pittsburg
the
deaths
due
to
industrial
accidents
in
were
all
the
result
of
accidents
in
mills
mines
or
on
railroads
for
the
entire
country
therefore
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
deaths
due
to
industrial
accidents
aggregate
in
the
neighborhood
of
twenty
thousand
a
year
such
a
record
makes
the
death
rate
in
all
our
foreign
wars
utterly
trivial
by
comparison
the
number
of
deaths
in
battle
in
all
the
foreign
wars
put
together
for
the
last
century
and
a
quarter
aggregate
considerably
less
than
one
years
death
record
for
our
industries
a
mere
glance
at
these
figures
is
sufficient
to
show
the
absurdity
of
the
outcry
against
militarism
but
again
and
again
in
the
past
our
little
regular
army
has
rendered
service
literally
vital
to
the
country
and
it
may
at
any
time
have
to
do
so
in
the
future
its
standard
of
efficiency
and
instruction
is
higher
now
than
ever
in
the
past
but
it
is
too
small
there
are
not
enough
officers
and
it
is
impossible
to
secure
enough
enlisted
men
we
should
maintain
in
peace
a
fairly
complete
skeleton
of
a
large
army
a
great
and
longcontinued
war
would
have
to
be
fought
by
volunteers
but
months
would
pass
before
any
large
body
of
efficient
volunteers
could
be
put
in
the
field
and
our
regular
army
should
be
large
enough
to
meet
any
immediate
need
in
particular
it
is
essential
that
we
should
possess
a
number
of
extra
officers
trained
in
peace
to
perform
efficiently
the
duties
urgently
required
upon
the
breaking
out
of
war
the
medical
corps
should
be
much
larger
than
the
needs
of
our
regular
army
in
war
yet
at
present
it
is
smaller
than
the
needs
of
the
service
demand
even
in
peace
the
spanish
war
occurred
less
than
ten
years
ago
the
chief
loss
we
suffered
in
it
was
by
disease
among
the
regiments
which
never
left
the
country
at
the
moment
the
nation
seemed
deeply
impressed
by
this
fact
yet
seemingly
it
has
already
been
forgotten
for
not
the
slightest
effort
has
been
made
to
prepare
a
medical
corps
of
sufficient
size
to
prevent
the
repetition
of
the
same
disaster
on
a
much
larger
scale
if
we
should
ever
be
engaged
in
a
serious
conflict
the
trouble
in
the
spanish
war
was
not
with
the
then
existing
officials
of
the
war
department
it
was
with
the
representatives
of
the
people
as
a
whole
who
for
the
preceding
thirty
years
had
declined
to
make
the
necessary
provision
for
the
army
unless
ample
provision
is
now
made
by
congress
to
put
the
medical
corps
where
it
should
be
put
disaster
in
the
next
war
is
inevitable
and
the
responsibility
will
not
lie
with
those
then
in
charge
of
the
war
department
but
with
those
who
now
decline
to
make
the
necessary
provision
a
well
organized
medical
corps
thoroughly
trained
before
the
advent
of
war
in
all
the
important
administrative
duties
of
a
military
sanitary
corps
is
essential
to
the
efficiency
of
any
large
army
and
especially
of
a
large
volunteer
army
such
knowledge
of
medicine
and
surgery
as
is
possessed
by
the
medical
profession
generally
will
not
alone
suffice
to
make
an
efficient
military
surgeon
he
must
have
in
addition
knowledge
of
the
administration
and
sanitation
of
large
field
hospitals
and
camps
in
order
to
safeguard
the
health
and
lives
of
men
intrusted
in
great
numbers
to
his
care
a
bill
has
long
been
pending
before
the
congress
for
the
reorganization
of
the
medical
corps
its
passage
is
urgently
needed
but
the
medical
department
is
not
the
only
department
for
which
increased
provision
should
be
made
the
rate
of
pay
for
the
officers
should
be
greatly
increased
there
is
no
higher
type
of
citizen
than
the
american
regular
officer
and
he
should
have
a
fair
reward
for
his
admirable
work
there
should
be
a
relatively
even
greater
increase
in
the
pay
for
the
enlisted
men
in
especial
provision
should
be
made
for
establishing
grades
equivalent
to
those
of
warrant
officers
in
the
navy
which
should
be
open
to
the
enlisted
men
who
serve
sufficiently
long
and
who
do
their
work
well
inducements
should
be
offered
sufficient
to
encourage
really
good
men
to
make
the
army
a
life
occupation
the
prime
needs
of
our
present
army
is
to
secure
and
retain
competent
noncommissioned
officers
this
difficulty
rests
fundamentally
on
the
question
of
pay
the
noncommissioned
officer
does
not
correspond
with
an
unskilled
laborer
he
corresponds
to
the
best
type
of
skilled
workma
n
or
to
the
subordinate
official
in
civil
institutions
wages
have
greatly
increased
in
outside
occupations
in
the
last
forty
years
and
the
pay
of
the
soldier
like
the
pay
of
the
officers
should
be
proportionately
increased
the
first
sergeant
of
a
company
if
a
good
man
must
be
one
of
such
executive
and
administrative
ability
and
such
knowledge
of
his
trade
as
to
be
worth
far
more
than
we
at
present
pay
him
the
same
is
true
of
the
regimental
sergeant
major
these
men
should
be
men
who
had
fully
resolved
to
make
the
army
a
life
occupation
and
they
should
be
able
to
look
forward
to
ample
reward
while
only
men
properly
qualified
should
be
given
a
chance
to
secure
these
final
rewards
the
increase
over
the
present
pay
need
not
be
great
in
the
lower
grades
for
the
first
one
or
two
enlistments
but
the
increase
should
be
marked
for
the
noncommissioned
officers
of
the
upper
grades
who
serve
long
enough
to
make
it
evident
that
they
intend
to
stay
permanently
in
the
army
while
additional
pay
should
be
given
for
high
qualifications
in
target
practice
the
position
of
warrant
officer
should
be
established
and
there
should
be
not
only
an
increase
of
pay
but
an
increase
of
privileges
and
allowances
and
dignity
so
as
to
make
the
grade
open
to
noncommissioned
officers
capable
of
filling
them
desirably
from
every
standpoint
the
rate
of
desertion
in
our
army
now
in
time
of
peace
is
alarming
the
deserter
should
be
treated
by
public
opinion
as
a
man
guilty
of
the
greatest
crime
while
on
the
other
hand
the
man
who
serves
steadily
in
the
army
should
be
treated
as
what
he
is
that
is
as
preeminently
one
of
the
best
citizens
of
this
republic
after
twelve
years
service
in
the
army
my
own
belief
is
that
the
man
should
be
given
a
preference
according
to
his
ability
for
certain
types
of
office
over
all
civilian
applicants
without
examination
this
should
also
apply
of
course
to
the
men
who
have
served
twelve
years
in
the
navy
a
special
corps
should
be
provided
to
do
the
manual
labor
now
necessarily
demanded
of
the
privates
themselves
among
the
officers
there
should
be
severe
examinations
to
weed
out
the
unfit
up
to
the
grade
of
major
from
that
position
on
appointments
should
be
solely
by
selection
and
it
should
be
understood
that
a
man
of
merely
average
capacity
could
never
get
beyond
the
position
of
major
while
every
man
who
serves
in
any
grade
a
certain
length
of
time
prior
to
promotion
to
the
next
grade
without
getting
the
promotion
to
the
next
grade
should
be
forthwith
retired
the
practice
marches
and
field
maneuvers
of
the
last
two
or
three
years
have
been
invaluable
to
the
army
they
should
be
continued
and
extended
a
rigid
and
not
a
perfunctory
examination
of
physical
capacity
has
been
provided
for
the
higher
grade
officers
this
will
work
well
unless
an
officer
has
a
good
physique
unless
he
can
stand
hardship
ride
well
and
walk
fairly
he
is
not
fit
for
any
position
even
after
he
has
become
a
colonel
before
he
has
become
a
colonel
the
need
for
physical
fitness
in
the
officers
is
almost
as
great
as
in
the
enlisted
man
i
hope
speedily
to
see
introduced
into
the
army
a
far
more
rigid
and
thoroughgoing
test
of
horsemanship
for
all
field
officers
than
at
present
there
should
be
a
chief
of
cavalry
just
as
there
is
a
chief
of
artillery
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
legislation
needed
for
the
benefit
of
the
army
is
a
law
to
equalize
and
increase
the
pay
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
of
the
army
navy
marine
corps
and
revenuecutter
service
such
a
bill
has
been
prepared
which
it
is
hoped
will
meet
with
your
favorable
consideration
the
next
most
essential
measure
is
to
authorize
a
number
of
extra
officers
as
mentioned
above
to
make
the
army
more
attractive
to
enlisted
men
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
create
a
service
corps
such
as
exists
in
nearly
every
modern
army
in
the
world
to
do
the
skilled
and
unskilled
labor
inseparably
connected
with
military
administration
which
is
now
exacted
without
just
compensation
of
enlisted
men
who
voluntarily
entered
the
army
to
do
service
of
an
altogether
different
kind
there
are
a
number
of
other
laws
necessary
to
so
organize
the
army
as
to
promote
its
efficiency
and
facilitate
its
rapid
expansion
in
time
of
war
but
the
above
are
the
most
important
it
was
hoped
the
hague
conference
might
deal
with
the
question
of
the
limitation
of
armaments
but
even
before
it
had
assembled
informal
inquiries
had
developed
that
as
regards
naval
armaments
the
only
ones
in
which
this
country
had
any
interest
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
devise
any
plan
for
which
there
was
the
slightest
possibility
of
securing
the
assent
of
the
nations
gathered
at
the
hague
no
plan
was
even
proposed
which
would
have
had
the
assent
of
more
than
one
first
class
power
outside
of
the
united
states
the
only
plan
that
seemed
at
all
feasible
that
of
limiting
the
size
of
battleships
met
with
no
favor
at
all
it
is
evident
therefore
that
it
is
folly
for
this
nation
to
base
any
hope
of
securing
peace
on
any
international
agreement
as
to
the
limitations
of
armaments
such
being
the
fact
it
would
be
most
unwise
for
us
to
stop
the
upbuilding
of
our
navy
to
build
one
battleship
of
the
best
and
most
advanced
type
a
year
would
barely
keep
our
fleet
up
to
its
present
force
this
is
not
enough
in
my
judgment
we
should
this
year
provide
for
four
battleships
but
it
is
idle
to
build
battleships
unless
in
addition
to
providing
the
men
and
the
means
for
thorough
training
we
provide
the
auxiliaries
for
them
unless
we
provide
docks
the
coaling
stations
the
colliers
and
supply
ships
that
they
need
we
are
extremely
deficient
in
coaling
stations
and
docks
on
the
pacific
and
this
deficiency
should
not
longer
be
permitted
to
exist
plenty
of
torpedo
boats
and
destroyers
should
be
built
both
on
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
fortifications
of
the
best
type
should
be
provided
for
all
our
greatest
harbors
we
need
always
to
remember
that
in
time
of
war
the
navy
is
not
to
be
used
to
defend
harbors
and
seacoast
cities
we
should
perfect
our
system
of
coast
fortifications
the
only
efficient
use
for
the
navy
is
for
offense
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
efficiently
protect
our
own
coast
against
the
possible
action
of
a
foreign
navy
is
by
destroying
that
foreign
navy
for
defense
against
a
hostile
fleet
which
actually
attacks
them
the
coast
cities
must
depend
upon
their
forts
mines
torpedoes
submarines
and
torpedo
boats
and
destroyers
all
of
these
together
are
efficient
for
defensive
purposes
but
they
in
no
way
supply
the
place
of
a
thoroughly
efficient
navy
capable
of
acting
on
the
offensive
for
parrying
never
yet
won
a
fight
it
can
only
be
won
by
hard
hitting
and
an
aggressive
seagoing
navy
alone
can
do
this
hard
hitting
of
the
offensive
type
but
the
forts
and
the
like
are
necessary
so
that
the
navy
may
be
footloose
in
time
of
war
there
is
sure
to
be
demand
under
pressure
of
fright
for
the
ships
to
be
scattered
so
as
to
defend
all
kind
of
ports
under
penalty
of
terrible
disaster
this
demand
must
be
refused
the
ships
must
be
kept
together
and
their
objective
made
the
enemies
fleet
if
fortifications
are
sufficiently
strong
no
modern
navy
will
venture
to
attack
them
so
long
as
the
foe
has
in
existence
a
hostile
navy
of
anything
like
the
same
size
or
efficiency
but
unless
there
exists
such
a
navy
then
the
fortifications
are
powerless
by
themselves
to
secure
the
victory
for
of
course
the
mere
deficiency
means
that
any
resolute
enemy
can
at
his
leisure
combine
all
his
forces
upon
one
point
with
the
certainty
that
he
can
take
it
until
our
battle
fleet
is
much
larger
than
at
present
it
should
never
be
split
into
detachments
so
far
apart
that
they
could
not
in
event
of
emergency
be
speedily
united
our
coast
line
is
on
the
pacific
just
as
much
as
on
the
atlantic
the
interests
of
california
oregon
and
washington
are
as
emphatically
the
interests
of
the
whole
union
as
those
of
maine
and
new
york
of
louisiana
and
texas
the
battle
fleet
should
now
and
then
be
moved
to
the
pacific
just
as
at
other
times
it
should
be
kept
in
the
atlantic
when
the
isthmian
canal
is
built
the
transit
of
the
battle
fleet
from
one
ocean
to
the
other
will
be
comparatively
easy
until
it
is
built
i
earnestly
hope
that
the
battle
fleet
will
be
thus
shifted
between
the
two
oceans
every
year
or
two
the
marksmanship
on
all
our
ships
has
improved
phenomenally
during
the
last
five
years
until
within
the
last
two
or
three
years
it
was
not
possible
to
train
a
battle
fleet
in
squadron
maneuvers
under
service
conditions
and
it
is
only
during
these
last
two
or
three
years
that
the
training
under
these
conditions
has
become
really
effective
another
and
most
necessary
stride
in
advance
is
now
being
taken
the
battle
fleet
is
about
starting
by
the
straits
of
magellan
to
visit
the
pacific
coast
sixteen
battleships
are
going
under
the
command
of
rearadmiral
evans
while
eight
armored
cruisers
and
two
other
battleships
will
meet
him
at
san
francisco
whither
certain
torpedo
destroyers
are
also
going
no
fleet
of
such
size
has
ever
made
such
a
voyage
and
it
will
be
of
very
great
educational
use
to
all
engaged
in
it
the
only
way
by
which
to
teach
officers
and
men
how
to
handle
the
fleet
so
as
to
meet
every
possible
strain
and
emergency
in
time
of
war
is
to
have
them
practice
under
similar
conditions
in
time
of
peace
moreover
the
only
way
to
find
out
our
actual
needs
is
to
perform
in
time
of
peace
whatever
maneuvers
might
be
necessary
in
time
of
war
after
war
is
declared
it
is
too
late
to
find
out
the
needs
that
means
to
invite
disaster
this
trip
to
the
pacific
will
show
what
some
of
our
needs
are
and
will
enable
us
to
provide
for
them
the
proper
place
for
an
officer
to
learn
his
duty
is
at
sea
and
the
only
way
in
which
a
navy
can
ever
be
made
efficient
is
by
practice
at
sea
under
all
the
conditions
which
would
have
to
be
met
if
war
existed
i
bespeak
the
most
liberal
treatment
for
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
of
the
navy
it
is
true
of
them
as
likewise
of
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
of
the
army
that
they
form
a
body
whose
interests
should
be
close
to
the

heart
of
every
good
american
in
return
the
most
rigid
performance
of
duty
should
be
exacted
from
them
the
reward
should
be
ample
when
they
do
their
best
and
nothing
less
than
their
best
should
be
tolerated
it
is
idle
to
hope
for
the
best
results
when
the
men
in
the
senior
grades
come
to
those
grades
late
in
life
and
serve
too
short
a
time
in
them
up
to
the
rank
of
lieutenantcommander
promotion
in
the
navy
should
be
as
now
by
seniority
subject
however
to
such
rigid
tests
as
would
eliminate
the
unfit
after
the
grade
of
lieutenantcommander
that
is
when
we
come
to
the
grade
of
command
rank
the
unfit
should
be
eliminated
in
such
manner
that
only
the
conspicuously
fit
would
remain
and
sea
service
should
be
a
principal
test
of
fitness
those
who
are
passed
by
should
after
a
certain
length
of
service
in
their
respective
grades
be
retired
of
a
given
number
of
men
it
may
well
be
that
almost
all
would
make
good
lieutenants
and
most
of
them
good
lieutenantcommanders
while
only
a
minority
be
fit
to
be
captains
and
but
three
or
four
to
be
admirals
those
who
object
to
promotion
otherwise
than
by
mere
seniority
should
reflect
upon
the
elementary
fact
that
no
business
in
private
life
could
be
successfully
managed
if
those
who
enter
at
the
lowest
rungs
of
the
ladder
should
each
in
turn
if
he
lived
become
the
head
of
the
firm
its
active
director
and
retire
after
he
had
held
the
position
a
few
months
on
its
face
such
a
scheme
is
an
absurdity
chances
for
improper
favoritism
can
be
minimized
by
a
properly
formed
board
such
as
the
board
of
last
june
which
did
such
conscientious
and
excellent
work
in
elimination
if
all
that
ought
to
be
done
can
not
now
be
done
at
least
let
a
beginning
be
made
in
my
last
three
annual
messages
and
in
a
special
message
to
the
last
congress
the
necessity
for
legislation
that
will
cause
officers
of
the
line
of
the
navy
to
reach
the
grades
of
captain
and
rearadmiral
at
less
advanced
ages
and
which
will
cause
them
to
have
more
sea
training
and
experience
in
the
highly
responsible
duties
of
those
grades
so
that
they
may
become
thoroughly
skillful
in
handling
battleships
divisions
squadrons
and
fleets
in
action
has
been
fully
explained
and
urgently
recommended
upon
this
subject
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
submitted
detailed
and
definite
recommendations
which
have
received
my
approval
and
which
if
enacted
into
law
will
accomplish
what
is
immediately
necessary
and
will
as
compared
with
existing
law
make
a
saving
of
more
than
five
millions
of
dollars
during
the
next
seven
years
the
navy
personnel
act
of
has
accomplished
all
that
was
expected
of
it
in
providing
satisfactory
periods
of
service
in
the
several
subordinate
grades
from
the
grade
of
ensign
to
the
grade
of
lieutenantcommander
but
the
law
is
inadequate
in
the
upper
grades
and
will
continue
to
be
inadequate
on
account
of
the
expansion
of
the
personnel
since
its
enactment
your
attention
is
invited
to
the
following
quotations
from
the
report
of
the
personnel
board
of
of
which
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
was
president
congress
has
authorized
a
considerable
increase
in
the
number
of
midshipmen
at
the
naval
academy
and
these
midshipmen
upon
graduation
are
promoted
to
ensign
and
lieutenant
juniorgrade
but
no
provision
has
been
made
for
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
upper
grades
the
result
being
that
the
lower
grades
will
become
so
congested
that
a
midshipman
now
in
one
of
the
lowest
classes
at
annapolis
may
possibly
not
be
promoted
to
lieutenant
until
he
is
between
and
years
of
age
so
it
will
continue
under
the
present
law
congesting
at
the
top
and
congesting
at
the
bottom
the
country
fails
to
get
from
the
officers
of
the
service
the
best
that
is
in
them
by
not
providing
opportunity
for
their
normal
development
and
training
the
board
believes
that
this
works
a
serious
detriment
to
the
efficiency
of
the
navy
and
is
a
real
menace
to
the
public
safety
as
stated
in
my
special
message
to
the
last
congress
i
am
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
unless
the
present
conditions
of
the
higher
commissioned
personnel
is
rectified
by
judicious
legislation
the
future
of
our
navy
will
be
gravely
compromised
it
is
also
urgently
necessary
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
medical
corps
of
the
navy
special
legislation
to
this
end
has
already
been
proposed
and
i
trust
it
may
be
enacted
without
delay
it
must
be
remembered
that
everything
done
in
the
navy
to
fit
it
to
do
well
in
time
of
war
must
be
done
in
time
of
peace
modern
wars
are
short
they
do
not
last
the
length
of
time
requisite
to
build
a
battleship
and
it
takes
longer
to
train
the
officers
and
men
to
do
well
on
a
battleship
than
it
takes
to
build
it
nothing
effective
can
be
done
for
the
navy
once
war
has
begun
and
the
result
of
the
war
if
the
combatants
are
otherwise
equally
matched
will
depend
upon
which
power
has
prepared
best
in
time
of
peace
the
united
states
navy
is
the
best
guaranty
the
nation
has
that
its
honor
and
interest
will
not
be
neglected
and
in
addition
it
offers
by
far
the
best
insurance
for
peace
that
can
by
human
ingenuity
be
devised
i
call
attention
to
the
report
of
the
official
board
of
visitors
to
the
naval
academy
at
annapolis
which
has
been
forwarded
to
the
congress
the
report
contains
this
paragraph
such
revision
should
be
made
of
the
courses
of
study
and
methods
of
conducting
and
marking
examinations
as
will
develop
and
bring
out
the
average
allround
ability
of
the
midshipman
rather
than
to
give
him
prominence
in
any
one
particular
study
the
fact
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
naval
academy
is
not
a
university
but
a
school
the
primary
object
of
which
is
to
educate
boys
to
be
efficient
naval
officers
changes
in
curriculum
therefore
should
be
in
the
direction
of
making
the
course
of
instruction
less
theoretical
and
more
practical
no
portion
of
any
future
class
should
be
graduated
in
advance
of
the
full
four
years
course
and
under
no
circumstances
should
the
standard
of
instruction
be
lowered
the
academy
in
almost
all
of
its
departments
is
now
magnificently
equipped
and
it
would
be
very
unwise
to
make
the
course
of
instruction
less
exacting
than
it
is
today
acting
upon
this
suggestion
i
designated
three
seagoing
officers
capt
richard
wainwright
commander
robert
s
griffin
and
lieut
commander
albert
l
key
all
graduates
of
the
academy
to
investigate
conditions
and
to
recommend
to
me
the
best
method
of
carrying
into
effect
this
general
recommendation
these
officers
performed
the
duty
promptly
and
intelligently
and
under
the
personal
direction
of
capt
charles
j
badger
superintendent
of
the
academy
such
of
the
proposed
changes
as
were
deemed
to
be
at
present
advisable
were
put
into
effect
at
the
beginning
of
the
academic
year
october
last
the
results
i
am
confident
will
be
most
beneficial
to
the
academy
to
the
midshipmen
and
to
the
navy
in
foreign
affairs
this
countrys
steady
policy
is
to
behave
toward
other
nations
as
a
strong
and
selfrespecting
man
should
behave
toward
the
other
men
with
whom
he
is
brought
into
contact
in
other
words
our
aim
is
disinterestedly
to
help
other
nations
where
such
help
can
be
wisely
given
without
the
appearance
of
meddling
with
what
does
not
concern
us
to
be
careful
to
act
as
a
good
neighbor
and
at
the
same
time
in
goodnatured
fashion
to
make
it
evident
that
we
do
not
intend
to
be
imposed
upon
the
second
international
peace
conference
was
convened
at
the
hague
on
the
th
of
june
last
and
remained
in
session
until
the
th
of
october
for
the
first
time
the
representatives
of
practically
all
the
civilized
countries
of
the
world
united
in
a
temperate
and
kindly
discussion
of
the
methods
by
which
the
causes
of
war
might
be
narrowed
and
its
injurious
effects
reduced
although
the
agreements
reached
in
the
conference
did
not
in
any
direction
go
to
the
length
hoped
for
by
the
more
sanguine
yet
in
many
directions
important
steps
were
taken
and
upon
every
subject
on
the
programme
there
was
such
full
and
considerate
discussion
as
to
justify
the
belief
that
substantial
progress
has
been
made
toward
further
agreements
in
the
future
thirteen
conventions
were
agreed
upon
embodying
the
definite
conclusions
which
had
been
reached
and
resolutions
were
adopted
marking
the
progress
made
in
matters
upon
which
agreement
was
not
yet
sufficiently
complete
to
make
conventions
practicable
the
delegates
of
the
united
states
were
instructed
to
favor
an
agreement
for
obligatory
arbitration
the
establishment
of
a
permanent
court
of
arbitration
to
proceed
judicially
in
the
hearing
and
decision
of
international
causes
the
prohibition
of
force
for
the
collection
of
contract
debts
alleged
to
be
due
from
governments
to
citizens
of
other
countries
until
after
arbitration
as
to
the
justice
and
amount
of
the
debt
and
the
time
and
manner
of
payment
the
immunity
of
private
property
at
sea
the
better
definition
of
the
rights
of
neutrals
and
in
case
any
measure
to
that
end
should
be
introduced
the
limitation
of
armaments
in
the
field
of
peaceful
disposal
of
international
differences
several
important
advances
were
made
first
as
to
obligatory
arbitration
although
the
conference
failed
to
secure
a
unanimous
agreement
upon
the
details
of
a
convention
for
obligatory
arbitration
it
did
resolve
as
follows
it
is
unanimous
in
accepting
the
principle
for
obligatory
arbitration
in
declaring
that
certain
differences
and
notably
those
relating
to
the
interpretation
and
application
of
international
conventional
stipulations
are
susceptible
of
being
submitted
to
obligatory
arbitration
without
any
restriction
in
view
of
the
fact
that
as
a
result
of
the
discussion
the
vote
upon
the
definite
treaty
of
obligatory
arbitration
which
was
proposed
stood
in
favor
to
against
the
adoption
of
the
treaty
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
great
majority
of
the
countries
of
the
world
have
reached
a
point
where
they
are
now
ready
to
apply
practically
the
principles
thus
unanimously
agreed
upon
by
the
conference
the
second
advance
and
a
very
great
one
is
the
agreement
which
relates
to
the
use
of
force
for
the
collection
of
contract
debts
your

attention
is
invited
to
the
paragraphs
upon
this
subject
in
my
message
of
december
and
to
the
resolution
of
the
third
american
conference
at
rio
in
the
summer
of
the
convention
upon
this
subject
adopted
by
the
conference
substantially
as
proposed
by
the
american
delegates
is
as
follows
in
order
to
avoid
between
nations
armed
conflicts
of
a
purely
pecuniary
origin
arising
from
contractual
debts
claimed
of
the
government
of
one
country
by
the
government
of
another
country
to
be
due
to
its
nationals
the
signatory
powers
agree
not
to
have
recourse
to
armed
force
for
the
collection
of
such
contractual
debts
however
this
stipulation
shall
not
be
applicable
when
the
debtor
state
refuses
or
leaves
unanswered
an
offer
to
arbitrate
or
in
case
of
acceptance
makes
it
impossible
to
formulate
the
terms
of
submission
or
after
arbitration
fails
to
comply
with
the
award
rendered
it
is
further
agreed
that
arbitration
here
contemplated
shall
be
in
conformity
as
to
procedure
with
chapter
iii
of
the
convention
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
disputes
adopted
at
the
hague
and
that
it
shall
determine
in
so
far
as
there
shall
be
no
agreement
between
the
parties
the
justice
and
the
amount
of
the
debt
the
time
and
mode
of
payment
thereof
such
a
provision
would
have
prevented
much
injustice
and
extortion
in
the
past
and
i
cannot
doubt
that
its
effect
in
the
future
will
be
most
salutary
a
third
advance
has
been
made
in
amending
and
perfecting
the
convention
of
for
the
voluntary
settlement
of
international
disputes
and
particularly
the
extension
of
those
parts
of
that
convention
which
relate
to
commissions
of
inquiry
the
existence
of
those
provisions
enabled
the
governments
of
great
britain
and
russia
to
avoid
war
notwithstanding
great
public
excitement
at
the
time
of
the
dogger
bank
incident
and
the
new
convention
agreed
upon
by
the
conference
gives
practical
effect
to
the
experience
gained
in
that
inquiry
substantial
progress
was
also
made
towards
the
creation
of
a
permanent
judicial
tribunal
for
the
determination
of
international
causes
there
was
very
full
discussion
of
the
proposal
for
such
a
court
and
a
general
agreement
was
finally
reached
in
favor
of
its
creation
the
conference
recommended
to
the
signatory
powers
the
adoption
of
a
draft
upon
which
it
agreed
for
the
organization
of
the
court
leaving
to
be
determined
only
the
method
by
which
the
judges
should
be
selected
this
remaining
unsettled
question
is
plainly
one
which
time
and
good
temper
will
solve
a
further
agreement
of
the
first
importance
was
that
for
the
creation
of
an
international
prize
court
the
constitution
organization
and
procedure
of
such
a
tribunal
were
provided
for
in
detail
anyone
who
recalls
the
injustices
under
which
this
country
suffered
as
a
neutral
power
during
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
can
not
fail
to
see
in
this
provision
for
an
international
prize
court
the
great
advance
which
the
world
is
making
towards
the
substitution
of
the
rule
of
reason
and
justice
in
place
of
simple
force
not
only
will
the
international
prize
court
be
the
means
of
protecting
the
interests
of
neutrals
but
it
is
in
itself
a
step
towards
the
creation
of
the
more
general
court
for
the
hearing
of
international
controversies
to
which
reference
has
just
been
made
the
organization
and
action
of
such
a
prize
court
can
not
fail
to
accustom
the
different
countries
to
the
submission
of
international
questions
to
the
decision
of
an
international
tribunal
and
we
may
confidently
expect
the
results
of
such
submission
to
bring
about
a
general
agreement
upon
the
enlargement
of
the
practice
numerous
provisions
were
adopted
for
reducing
the
evil
effects
of
war
and
for
defining
the
rights
and
duties
of
neutrals
the
conference
also
provided
for
the
holding
of
a
third
conference
within
a
period
similar
to
that
which
elapsed
between
the
first
and
second
conferences
the
delegates
of
the
united
states
worthily
represented
the
spirit
of
the
american
people
and
maintained
with
fidelity
and
ability
the
policy
of
our
government
upon
all
the
great
questions
discussed
in
the
conference
the
report
of
the
delegation
together
with
authenticated
copies
of
the
conventions
signed
when
received
will
be
laid
before
the
senate
for
its
consideration
when
we
remember
how
difficult
it
is
for
one
of
our
own
legislative
bodies
composed
of
citizens
of
the
same
country
speaking
the
same
language
living
under
the
same
laws
and
having
the
same
customs
to
reach
an
agreement
or
even
to
secure
a
majority
upon
any
difficult
and
important
subject
which
is
proposed
for
legislation
it
becomes
plain
that
the
representatives
of
fortyfive
different
countries
speaking
many
different
languages
accustomed
to
different
methods
of
procedure
with
widely
diverse
interests
who
discussed
so
many
different
subjects
and
reached
agreements
upon
so
many
are
entitled
to
grateful
appreciation
for
the
wisdom
patience
and
moderation
with
which
they
have
discharged
their
duty
the
example
of
this
temperate
discussion
and
the
agreements
and
the
efforts
to
agree
among
representatives
of
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
acting
with
universal
recognition
of
the
supreme
obligation
to
promote
peace
can
not
fail
to
be
a
powerful
influence
for
good
in
future
international
relations
a
year
ago
in
consequence
of
a
revolutionary
movement
in
cuba
which
threatened
the
immediate
return
to
chaos
of
the
island
the
united
states
intervened
sending
down
an
army
and
establishing
a
provisional
government
under
governor
magoon
absolute
quiet
and
prosperity
have
returned
to
the
island
because
of
this
action
we
are
now
taking
steps
to
provide
for
elections
in
the
island
and
our
expectation
is
within
the
coming
year
to
be
able
to
turn
the
island
over
again
to
government
chosen
by
the
people
thereof
cuba
is
at
our
doors
it
is
not
possible
that
this
nation
should
permit
cuba
again
to
sink
into
the
condition
from
which
we
rescued
it
all
that
we
ask
of
the
cuban
people
is
that
they
be
prosperous
that
they
govern
themselves
so
as
to
bring
content
order
and
progress
to
their
island
the
queen
of
the
antilles
and
our
only
interference
has
been
and
will
be
to
help
them
achieve
these
results
an
invitation
has
been
extended
by
japan
to
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
to
participate
in
a
great
national
exposition
to
be
held
at
tokyo
from
april
to
october
and
in
which
the
principal
countries
of
the
world
are
to
be
invited
to
take
part
this
is
an
occasion
of
special
interest
to
all
the
nations
of
the
world
and
peculiarly
so
to
us
for
it
is
the
first
instance
in
which
such
a
great
national
exposition
has
been
held
by
a
great
power
dwelling
on
the
pacific
and
all
the
nations
of
europe
and
america
will
i
trust
join
in
helping
to
success
this
first
great
exposition
ever
held
by
a
great
nation
of
asia
the
geographical
relations
of
japan
and
the
united
states
as
the
possessors
of
such
large
portions
of
the
coasts
of
the
pacific
the
intimate
trade
relations
already
existing
between
the
two
countries
the
warm
friendship
which
has
been
maintained
between
them
without
break
since
the
opening
of
japan
to
intercourse
with
the
western
nations
and
her
increasing
wealth
and
production
which
we
regard
with
hearty
goodwill
and
wish
to
make
the
occasion
of
mutually
beneficial
commerce
all
unite
in
making
it
eminently
desirable
that
this
invitation
should
be
accepted
i
heartily
recommend
such
legislation
as
will
provide
in
generous
fashion
for
the
representation
of
this
government
and
its
people
in
the
proposed
exposition
action
should
be
taken
now
we
are
apt
to
underestimate
the
time
necessary
for
preparation
in
such
cases
the
invitation
to
the
french
exposition
of
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
by
president
cleveland
in
december
and
so
many
are
the
delays
necessary
to
such
proceedings
that
the
period
of
font
years
and
a
half
which
then
intervened
before
the
exposition
proved
none
too
long
for
the
proper
preparation
of
the
exhibits
the
adoption
of
a
new
tariff
by
germany
accompanied
by
conventions
for
reciprocal
tariff
concessions
between
that
country
and
most
of
the
other
countries
of
continental
europe
led
the
german
government
to
give
the
notice
necessary
to
terminate
the
reciprocal
commercial
agreement
with
this
country
proclaimed
july
the
notice
was
to
take
effect
on
the
st
of
march
and
in
default
of
some
other
arrangements
this
would
have
left
the
exports
from
the
united
states
to
germany
subject
to
the
general
german
tariff
duties
from
to
per
cent
higher
than
the
conventional
duties
imposed
upon
the
goods
of
most
of
our
competitors
for
german
trade
under
a
special
agreement
made
between
the
two
governments
in
february
the
german
government
postponed
the
operation
of
their
notice
until
the
th
of
june
in
the
meantime
deeming
it
to
be
my
duty
to
make
every
possible
effort
to
prevent
a
tariff
war
between
the
united
states
and
germany
arising
from
misunderstanding
by
either
country
of
the
conditions
existing
in
the
other
and
acting
upon
the
invitation
of
the
german
government
i
sent
to
berlin
a
commission
composed
of
competent
experts
in
the
operation
and
administration
of
the
customs
tariff
from
the
departments
of
the
treasury
and
commerce
and
labor
this
commission
was
engaged
for
several
mouths
in
conference
with
a
similar
commission
appointed
by
the
german
government
under
instructions
so
far
as
practicable
to
reach
a
common
understanding
as
to
all
the
facts
regarding
the
tariffs
of
the
united
states
and
germany
material
and
relevant
to
the
trade
relations
between
the
two
countries
the
commission
reported
and
upon
the
basis
of
the
report
a
further
temporary
commercial
agreement
was
entered
into
by
the
two
countries
pursuant
to
which
in
the
exercise
of
the
authority
conferred
upon
the
president
by
the
third
section
of
the
tariff
act
of
july
i
extended
the
reduced
tariff
rates
provided
for
in
that
section
to
champagne
and
all
other
sparkling
wines
and
pursuant
to
which
the
german
conventional
or
minimum
tariff
rates
were
extended
to
about
per
cent
of
all
the
exp
orts
from
the
united
states
to
germany
this
agreement
is
to
remain
in
force
until
the
th
of
june
and
until
six
months
after
notice
by
either
party
to
terminate
it
the
agreement
and
the
report
of
the
commission
on
which
it
is
based
will
be
laid
before
the
congress
for
its
information
this
careful
examination
into
the
tariff
relations
between
the
united
states
and
germany
involved
an
inquiry
into
certain
of
our
methods
of
administration
which
had
been
the
cause
of
much
complaint
on
the
part
of
german
exporters
in
this
inquiry
i
became
satisfied
that
certain
vicious
and
unjustifiable
practices
had
grown
up
in
our
customs
administration
notably
the
practice
of
determining
values
of
imports
upon
detective
reports
never
disclosed
to
the
persons
whose
interests
were
affected
the
use
of
detectives
though
often
necessary
tends
towards
abuse
and
should
be
carefully
guarded
under
our
practice
as
i
found
it
to
exist
in
this
case
the
abuse
had
become
gross
and
discreditable
under
it
instead
of
seeking
information
as
to
the
market
value
of
merchandise
from
the
wellknown
and
respected
members
of
the
commercial
community
in
the
country
of
its
production
secret
statements
were
obtained
from
informers
and
discharged
employees
and
business
rivals
and
upon
this
kind
of
secret
evidence
the
values
of
imported
goods
were
frequently
raised
and
heavy
penalties
were
frequently
imposed
upon
importers
who
were
never
permitted
to
know
what
the
evidence
was
and
who
never
had
an
opportunity
to
meet
it
it
is
quite
probable
that
this
system
tended
towards
an
increase
of
the
duties
collected
upon
imported
goods
but
i
conceive
it
to
be
a
violation
of
law
to
exact
more
duties
than
the
law
provides
just
as
it
is
a
violation
to
admit
goods
upon
the
payment
of
less
than
the
legal
rate
of
duty
this
practice
was
repugnant
to
the
spirit
of
american
law
and
to
american
sense
of
justice
in
the
judgment
of
the
most
competent
experts
of
the
treasury
department
and
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
it
was
wholly
unnecessary
for
the
due
collection
of
the
customs
revenues
and
the
attempt
to
defend
it
merely
illustrates
the
demoralization
which
naturally
follows
from
a
long
continued
course
of
reliance
upon
such
methods
i
accordingly
caused
the
regulations
governing
this
branch
of
the
customs
service
to
be
modified
so
that
values
are
determined
upon
a
hearing
in
which
all
the
parties
interested
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
to
know
the
evidence
against
them
moreover
our
treasury
agents
are
accredited
to
the
government
of
the
country
in
which
they
seek
information
and
in
germany
receive
the
assistance
of
the
quasiofficial
chambers
of
commerce
in
determining
the
actual
market
value
of
goods
in
accordance
with
what
i
am
advised
to
be
the
true
construction
of
the
law
these
changes
of
regulations
were
adapted
to
the
removal
of
such
manifest
abuses
that
i
have
not
felt
that
they
ought
to
be
confined
to
our
relations
with
germany
and
i
have
extended
their
operation
to
all
other
countries
which
have
expressed
a
desire
to
enter
into
similar
administrative
relations
i
ask
for
authority
to
reform
the
agreement
with
china
under
which
the
indemnity
of
was
fixed
by
remitting
and
cancelling
the
obligation
of
china
for
the
payment
of
all
that
part
of
the
stipulated
indemnity
which
is
in
excess
of
the
sum
of
eleven
million
six
hundred
and
fiftyfive
thousand
four
hundred
and
ninetytwo
dollars
and
sixtynine
cents
and
interest
at
four
per
cent
after
the
rescue
of
the
foreign
legations
in
peking
during
the
boxer
troubles
in
the
powers
required
from
china
the
payment
of
equitable
indemnities
to
the
several
nations
and
the
final
protocol
under
which
the
troops
were
withdrawn
signed
at
peking
september
fixed
the
amount
of
this
indemnity
allotted
to
the
united
states
at
over
and
china
paid
up
to
and
including
the
st
day
of
june
last
a
little
over
it
was
the
first
intention
of
this
government
at
the
proper
time
when
all
claims
had
been
presented
and
all
expenses
ascertained
as
fully
as
possible
to
revise
the
estimates
and
account
and
as
a
proof
of
sincere
friendship
for
china
voluntarily
to
release
that
country
from
its
legal
liability
for
all
payments
in
excess
of
the
sum
which
should
prove
to
be
necessary
for
actual
indemnity
to
the
united
states
and
its
citizens
this
nation
should
help
in
every
practicable
way
in
the
education
of
the
chinese
people
so
that
the
vast
and
populous
empire
of
china
may
gradually
adapt
itself
to
modern
conditions
one
way
of
doing
this
is
by
promoting
the
coming
of
chinese
students
to
this
country
and
making
it
attractive
to
them
to
take
courses
at
our
universities
and
higher
educational
institutions
our
educators
should
so
far
as
possible
take
concerted
action
toward
this
end
on
the
courteous
invitation
of
the
president
of
mexico
the
secretary
of
state
visited
that
country
in
september
and
october
and
was
received
everywhere
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
hospitality
he
carried
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
our
southern
neighbor
a
message
of
respect
and
good
will
and
of
desire
for
better
acquaintance
and
increasing
friendship
the
response
from
the
government
and
the
people
of
mexico
was
hearty
and
sincere
no
pains
were
spared
to
manifest
the
most
friendly
attitude
and
feeling
toward
the
united
states
in
view
of
the
close
neighborhood
of
the
two
countries
the
relations
which
exist
between
mexico
and
the
united
states
are
just
cause
for
gratification
we
have
a
common
boundary
of
over
miles
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
pacific
much
of
it
is
marked
only
by
the
shifting
waters
of
the
rio
grande
many
thousands
of
mexicans
are
residing
upon
our
side
of
the
line
and
it
is
estimated
that
over
americans
are
resident
in
mexican
territory
and
that
american
investments
in
mexico
amount
to
over
seven
hundred
million
dollars
the
extraordinary
industrial
and
commercial
prosperity
of
mexico
has
been
greatly
promoted
by
american
enterprise
and
americans
are
sharing
largely
in
its
results
the
foreign
trade
of
the
republic
already
exceeds
per
annum
and
of
this
twothirds
both
of
exports
and
imports
are
exchanged
with
the
united
states
under
these
circumstances
numerous
questions
necessarily
arise
between
the
two
countries
these
questions
are
always
approached
and
disposed
of
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
courtesy
and
fair
dealing
americans
carrying
on
business
in
mexico
testify
uniformly
to
the
kindness
and
consideration
with
which
they
are
treated
and
their
sense
of
the
security
of
their
property
and
enterprises
under
the
wise
administration
of
the
great
statesman
who
has
so
long
held
the
office
of
chief
magistrate
of
that
republic
the
two
governments
have
been
uniting
their
efforts
for
a
considerable
time
past
to
aid
central
america
in
attaining
the
degree
of
peace
and
order
which
have
made
possible
the
prosperity
of
the
northern
ports
of
the
continent
after
the
peace
between
guatemala
honduras
and
salvador
celebrated
under
the
circumstances
described
in
my
last
message
a
new
war
broke
out
between
the
republics
of
nicaragua
honduras
and
salvador
the
effort
to
compose
this
new
difficulty
has
resulted
in
the
acceptance
of
the
joint
suggestion
of
the
presidents
of
mexico
and
of
the
united
states
for
a
general
peace
conference
between
all
the
countries
of
central
america
on
the
th
day
of
september
last
a
protocol
was
signed
between
the
representatives
of
the
five
central
american
countries
accredited
to
this
government
agreeing
upon
a
conference
to
be
held
in
the
city
of
washington
in
order
to
devise
the
means
of
preserving
the
good
relations
among
said
republics
and
bringing
about
permanent
peace
in
those
countries
the
protocol
includes
the
expression
of
a
wish
that
the
presidents
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
should
appoint
representatives
to
lend
their
good
and
impartial
offices
in
a
purely
friendly
way
toward
the
realization
of
the
objects
of
the
conference
the
conference
is
now
in
session
and
will
have
our
best
wishes
and
where
it
is
practicable
our
friendly
assistance
one
of
the
results
of
the
pan
american
conference
at
rio
janeiro
in
the
summer
of
has
been
a
great
increase
in
the
activity
and
usefulness
of
the
international
bureau
of
american
republics
that
institution
which
includes
all
the
american
republics
in
its
membership
and
brings
all
their
representatives
together
is
doing
a
really
valuable
work
in
informing
the
people
of
the
united
states
about
the
other
republics
and
in
making
the
united
states
known
to
them
its
action
is
now
limited
by
appropriations
determined
when
it
was
doing
a
work
on
a
much
smaller
scale
and
rendering
much
less
valuable
service
i
recommend
that
the
contribution
of
this
government
to
the
expenses
of
the
bureau
be
made
commensurate
with
its
increased
work

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
as
a
nation
we
still
continue
to
enjoy
a
literally
unprecedented
prosperity
and
it
is
probable
that
only
reckless
speculation
and
disregard
of
legitimate
business
methods
on
the
part
of
the
business
world
can
materially
mar
this
prosperity
no
congress
in
our
time
has
done
more
good
work
of
importance
than
the
present
congress
there
were
several
matters
left
unfinished
at
your
last
session
however
which
i
most
earnestly
hope
you
will
complete
before
your
adjournment
i
again
recommend
a
law
prohibiting
all
corporations
from
contributing
to
the
campaign
expenses
of
any
party
such
a
bill
has
already
past
one
house
of
congress
let
individuals
contribute
as
they
desire
but
let
us
prohibit
in
effective
fashion
all
corporations
from
making
contributions
for
any
political
purpose
directly
or
indirectly
another
bill
which
has
just
past
one
house
of
the
congress
and
which
it
is
urgently
necessary
should
be
enacted
into
law
is
that
conferring
upon
the
government
the
right
of
appeal
in
criminal
cases
on
questions
of
law
this
right
exists
in
many
of
the
states
it
exists
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
act
of
the
congress
it
is
of
course
not
proposed
that
in
any
case
a
verdict
for
the
defendant
on
the
merits
should
be
set
aside
recently
in
one
district
where
the
government
had
indicted
certain
persons
for
conspiracy
in
connection
with
rebates
the
court
sustained
the
defendants
demurrer
while
in
another
jurisdiction
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
to
obtain
rebates
has
been
sustained
by
the
court
convictions
obtained
under
it
and
two
defendants
sentenced
to
imprisonment
the
two
cases
referred
to
may
not
be
in
real
conflict
with
each
other
but
it
is
unfortunate
that
there
should
even
be
an
apparent
conflict
at
present
there
is
no
way
by
which
the
government
can
cause
such
a
conflict
when
it
occurs
to
be
solved
by
an
appeal
to
a
higher
court
and
the
wheels
of
justice
are
blocked
without
any
real
decision
of
the
question
i
can
not
too
strongly
urge
the
passage
of
the
bill
in
question
a
failure
to
pass
it
will
result
in
seriously
hampering
the
government
in
its
effort
to
obtain
justice
especially
against
wealthy
individuals
or
corporations
who
do
wrong
and
may
also
prevent
the
government
from
obtaining
justice
for
wageworkers
who
are
not
themselves
able
effectively
to
contest
a
case
where
the
judgment
of
an
inferior
court
has
been
against
them
i
have
specifically
in
view
a
recent
decision
by
a
district
judge
leaving
railway
employees
without
remedy
for
violation
of
a
certain
socalled
labor
statute
it
seems
an
absurdity
to
permit
a
single
district
judge
against
what
may
be
the
judgment
of
the
immense
majority
of
his
colleagues
on
the
bench
to
declare
a
law
solemnly
enacted
by
the
congress
to
be
unconstitutional
and
then
to
deny
to
the
government
the
right
to
have
the
supreme
court
definitely
decide
the
question
it
is
well
to
recollect
that
the
real
efficiency
of
the
law
often
depends
not
upon
the
passage
of
acts
as
to
which
there
is
great
public
excitement
but
upon
the
passage
of
acts
of
this
nature
as
to
which
there
is
not
much
public
excitement
because
there
is
little
public
understanding
of
their
importance
while
the
interested
parties
are
keenly
alive
to
the
desirability
of
defeating
them
the
importance
of
enacting
into
law
the
particular
bill
in
question
is
further
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
government
has
now
definitely
begun
a
policy
of
resorting
to
the
criminal
law
in
those
trust
and
interstate
commerce
cases
where
such
a
course
offers
a
reasonable
chance
of
success
at
first
as
was
proper
every
effort
was
made
to
enforce
these
laws
by
civil
proceedings
but
it
has
become
increasingly
evident
that
the
action
of
the
government
in
finally
deciding
in
certain
cases
to
undertake
criminal
proceedings
was
justifiable
and
though
there
have
been
some
conspicuous
failures
in
these
cases
we
have
had
many
successes
which
have
undoubtedly
had
a
deterrent
effect
upon
evildoers
whether
the
penalty
inflicted
was
in
the
shape
of
fine
or
imprisonmentand
penalties
of
both
kinds
have
already
been
inflicted
by
the
courts
of
course
where
the
judge
can
see
his
way
to
inflict
the
penalty
of
imprisonment
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
punishment
on
other
offenders
is
increased
but
sufficiently
heavy
fines
accomplish
much
judge
holt
of
the
new
york
district
court
in
a
recent
decision
admirably
stated
the
need
for
treating
with
just
severity
offenders
of
this
kind
his
opinion
runs
in
part
as
follows
the
governments
evidence
to
establish
the
defendants
guilt
was
clear
conclusive
and
undisputed
the
case
was
a
flagrant
one
the
transactions
which
took
place
under
this
illegal
contract
were
very
large
the
amounts
of
rebates
returned
were
considerable
and
the
amount
of
the
rebate
itself
was
large
amounting
to
more
than
onefifth
of
the
entire
tariff
charge
for
the
transportation
of
merchandise
from
this
city
to
detroit
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
in
my
opinion
that
if
this
business
was
carried
on
for
a
considerable
time
on
that
basisthat
is
if
this
discrimination
in
favor
of
this
particular
shipper
was
made
with
an
instead
of
a
cent
rate
and
the
tariff
rate
was
maintained
as
against
their
competitorsthe
result
might
be
and
not
improbably
would
be
that
their
competitors
would
be
driven
out
of
business
this
crime
is
one
which
in
its
nature
is
deliberate
and
premeditated
i
think
over
a
fortnight
elapsed
between
the
date
of
palmers
letter
requesting
the
reduced
rate
and
the
answer
of
the
railroad
company
deciding
to
grant
it
and
then
for
months
afterwards
this
business
was
carried
on
and
these
claims
for
rebates
submitted
month
after
month
and
checks
in
payment
of
them
drawn
month
after
month
such
a
violation
of
the
law
in
my
opinion
in
its
essential
nature
is
a
very
much
more
heinous
act
than
the
ordinary
common
vulgar
crimes
which
come
before
criminal
courts
constantly
for
punishment
and
which
arise
from
sudden
passion
or
temptation
this
crime
in
this
case
was
committed
by
men
of
education
and
of
large
business
experience
whose
standing
in
the
community
was
such
that
they
might
have
been
expected
to
set
an
example
of
obedience
to
law
upon
the
maintenance
of
which
alone
in
this
country
the
security
of
their
property
depends
it
was
committed
on
behalf
of
a
great
railroad
corporation
which
like
other
railroad
corporations
has
received
gratuitously
from
the
state
large
and
valuable
privileges
for
the
publics
convenience
and
its
own
which
performs
quasi
public
functions
and
which
is
charged
with
the
highest
obligation
in
the
transaction
of
its
business
to
treat
the
citizens
of
this
country
alike
and
not
to
carry
on
its
business
with
unjust
discriminations
between
different
citizens
or
different
classes
of
citizens
this
crime
in
its
nature
is
one
usually
done
with
secrecy
and
proof
of
which
it
is
very
difficult
to
obtain
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
past
in
nearly
twenty
years
ago
ever
since
that
time
complaints
of
the
granting
of
rebates
by
railroads
have
been
common
urgent
and
insistent
and
although
the
congress
has
repeatedly
past
legislation
endeavoring
to
put
a
stop
to
this
evil
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
proof
upon
which
to
bring
prosecution
in
these
cases
is
so
great
that
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
ever
been
brought
in
this
court
and
as
i
am
formed
this
case
and
one
recently
brought
in
philadelphia
are
the
only
cases
that
have
ever
been
brought
in
the
eastern
part
of
this
country
in
fact
but
few
cases
of
this
kind
have
ever
been
brought
in
this
country
east
or
west
now
under
these
circumstances
i
am
forced
to
the
conclusion
in
a
case
in
which
the
proof
is
so
clear
and
the
facts
are
so
flagrant
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
fix
a
penalty
which
shall
in
some
degree
be
commensurate
with
the
gravity
of
the
offense
as
between
the
two
defendants
in
my
opinion
the
principal
penalty
should
be
imposed
on
the
corporation
the
traffic
manager
in
this
case
presumably
acted
without
any
advantage
to
himself
and
without
any
interest
in
the
transaction
either
by
the
direct
authority
or
in
accordance
with
what
he
understood
to
be
the
policy
or
the
wishes
of
his
employer
the
sentence
of
this
court
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
pomeroy
for
each
of
the
six
offenses
upon
which
he
has
been
convicted
be
fined
the
sum
of
making
six
fines
amounting
in
all
to
the
sum
of
and
the
defendant
the
new
york
central
and
hudson
river
railroad
company
for
each
of
the
six
crimes
of
which
it
has
been
convicted
be
fined
the
sum
of
making
six
fines
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
the
sum
of
and
judgment
to
that
effect
will
be
entered
in
this
case
in
connection
with
this
matter
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
very
unsatisfactory
state
of
our
criminal
law
resulting
in
large
part
from
the
habit
of
setting
aside
the
judgments
of
inferior
courts
on
technicalities
absolutely
unconnected
with
the
merits
of
the
case
and
where
there
is
no
attempt
to
show
that
there
has
been
any
failure
of
substantial
justice
it
would
be
well
to
enact
a
law
providing
something
to
the
effect
that
no
judgment
shall
be
set
aside
or
new
trial
granted
in
any
cause
civil
or
criminal
on
the
ground
of
misdirection
of
the
jury
or
the
improper
admission
or
rejection
of
evidence
or
for
error
as
to
any
matter
of
pleading
or
procedure
unless
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
which
the
application
is
made
after
an
examination
of
the
entire
cause
it
shall
affirmatively
appear
that
the
error
complained
of
has
resulted
in
a
miscarriage
of
justice
in
my
last
message
i
suggested
the
enactment
of
a
law
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
injunctions
attention
having
been
sharply
drawn
to
the
matter
by
the
demand
that
the
right
of
applying
injunctions
in
labor
cases
should
be
wholly
abolished
it
is
at
least
doubtful
whether
a
law
abolishing
altogether
the
use
of
injunctions
in
such
cases
would
stand
the
test
of
the
courts
in
which
case
of
course
the
legislation
would
be
ineffective
moreover
i
believe
it
would
be
wrong
altogether
to
prohibit
the
use
of
injunctions
it
is
criminal
to
permit
sym
pathy
for
criminals
to
weaken
our
hands
in
upholding
the
law
and
if
men
seek
to
destroy
life
or
property
by
mob
violence
there
should
be
no
impairment
of
the
power
of
the
courts
to
deal
with
them
in
the
most
summary
and
effective
way
possible
but
so
far
as
possible
the
abuse
of
the
power
should
be
provided
against
by
some
such
law
as
i
advocated
last
year
in
this
matter
of
injunctions
there
is
lodged
in
the
hands
of
the
judiciary
a
necessary
power
which
is
nevertheless
subject
to
the
possibility
of
grave
abuse
it
is
a
power
that
should
be
exercised
with
extreme
care
and
should
be
subject
to
the
jealous
scrutiny
of
all
men
and
condemnation
should
be
meted
out
as
much
to
the
judge
who
fails
to
use
it
boldly
when
necessary
as
to
the
judge
who
uses
it
wantonly
or
oppressively
of
course
a
judge
strong
enough
to
be
fit
for
his
office
will
enjoin
any
resort
to
violence
or
intimidation
especially
by
conspiracy
no
matter
what
his
opinion
may
be
of
the
rights
of
the
original
quarrel
there
must
be
no
hesitation
in
dealing
with
disorder
but
there
must
likewise
be
no
such
abuse
of
the
injunctive
power
as
is
implied
in
forbidding
laboring
men
to
strive
for
their
own
betterment
in
peaceful
and
lawful
ways
nor
must
the
injunction
be
used
merely
to
aid
some
big
corporation
in
carrying
out
schemes
for
its
own
aggrandizement
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
preliminary
injunction
in
a
labor
case
if
granted
without
adequate
proof
even
when
authority
can
be
found
to
support
the
conclusions
of
law
on
which
it
is
founded
may
often
settle
the
dispute
between
the
parties
and
therefore
if
improperly
granted
may
do
irreparable
wrong
yet
there
are
many
judges
who
assume
a
matterofcourse
granting
of
a
preliminary
injunction
to
be
the
ordinary
and
proper
judicial
disposition
of
such
cases
and
there
have
undoubtedly
been
flagrant
wrongs
committed
by
judges
in
connection
with
labor
disputes
even
within
the
last
few
years
although
i
think
much
less
often
than
in
former
years
such
judges
by
their
unwise
action
immensely
strengthen
the
hands
of
those
who
are
striving
entirely
to
do
away
with
the
power
of
injunction
and
therefore
such
careless
use
of
the
injunctive
process
tends
to
threaten
its
very
existence
for
if
the
american
people
ever
become
convinced
that
this
process
is
habitually
abused
whether
in
matters
affecting
labor
or
in
matters
affecting
corporations
it
will
be
wellnigh
impossible
to
prevent
its
abolition
it
may
be
the
highest
duty
of
a
judge
at
any
given
moment
to
disregard
not
merely
the
wishes
of
individuals
of
great
political
or
financial
power
but
the
overwhelming
tide
of
public
sentiment
and
the
judge
who
does
thus
disregard
public
sentiment
when
it
is
wrong
who
brushes
aside
the
plea
of
any
special
interest
when
the
pleading
is
not
rounded
on
righteousness
performs
the
highest
service
to
the
country
such
a
judge
is
deserving
of
all
honor
and
all
honor
can
not
be
paid
to
this
wise
and
fearless
judge
if
we
permit
the
growth
of
an
absurd
convention
which
would
forbid
any
criticism
of
the
judge
of
another
type
who
shows
himself
timid
in
the
presence
of
arrogant
disorder
or
who
on
insufficient
grounds
grants
an
injunction
that
does
grave
injustice
or
who
in
his
capacity
as
a
construer
and
therefore
in
part
a
maker
of
the
law
in
flagrant
fashion
thwarts
the
cause
of
decent
government
the
judge
has
a
power
over
which
no
review
can
be
exercised
he
himself
sits
in
review
upon
the
acts
of
both
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
the
government
save
in
the
most
extraordinary
cases
he
is
amenable
only
at
the
bar
of
public
opinion
and
it
is
unwise
to
maintain
that
public
opinion
in
reference
to
a
man
with
such
power
shall
neither
be
exprest
nor
led
the
best
judges
have
ever
been
foremost
to
disclaim
any
immunity
from
criticism
this
has
been
true
since
the
days
of
the
great
english
lord
chancellor
parker
who
said
let
all
people
be
at
liberty
to
know
what
i
found
my
judgment
upon
that
so
when
i
have
given
it
in
any
cause
others
may
be
at
liberty
to
judge
of
me
the
proprieties
of
the
case
were
set
forth
with
singular
clearness
and
good
temper
by
judge
w
h
taft
when
a
united
states
circuit
judge
eleven
years
ago
in
the
opportunity
freely
and
publicly
to
criticize
judicial
action
is
of
vastly
more
importance
to
the
body
politic
than
the
immunity
of
courts
and
judges
from
unjust
aspersions
and
attack
nothing
tends
more
to
render
judges
careful
in
their
decisions
and
anxiously
solicitous
to
do
exact
justice
than
the
consciousness
that
every
act
of
theirs
is
to
be
subjected
to
the
intelligent
scrutiny
and
candid
criticism
of
their
fellowmen
such
criticism
is
beneficial
in
proportion
as
it
is
fair
dispassionate
discriminating
and
based
on
a
knowledge
of
sound
legal
principles
the
comments
made
by
learned
text
writers
and
by
the
acute
editors
of
the
various
law
reviews
upon
judicial
decisions
are
therefore
highly
useful
such
critics
constitute
more
or
less
impartial
tribunals
of
professional
opinion
before
which
each
judgment
is
made
to
stand
or
fall
on
its
merits
and
thus
exert
a
strong
influence
to
secure
uniformity
of
decision
but
nonprofessional
criticism
also
is
by
no
means
without
its
uses
even
if
accompanied
as
it
often
is
by
a
direct
attack
upon
the
judicial
fairness
and
motives
of
the
occupants
of
the
bench
for
if
the
law
is
but
the
essence
of
common
sense
the
protest
of
many
average
men
may
evidence
a
defect
in
a
judicial
conclusion
though
based
on
the
nicest
legal
reasoning
and
profoundest
learning
the
two
important
elements
of
moral
character
in
a
judge
are
an
earnest
desire
to
reach
a
just
conclusion
and
courage
to
enforce
it
in
so
far
as
fear
of
public
comment
does
not
affect
the
courage
of
a
judge
but
only
spurs
him
on
to
search
his
conscience
and
to
reach
the
result
which
approves
itself
to
his
inmost
heart
such
comment
serves
a
useful
purpose
there
are
few
men
whether
they
are
judges
for
life
or
for
a
shorter
term
who
do
not
prefer
to
earn
and
hold
the
respect
of
all
and
who
can
not
be
reached
and
made
to
pause
and
deliberate
by
hostile
public
criticism
in
the
case
of
judges
having
a
life
tenure
indeed
their
very
independence
makes
the
right
freely
to
comment
on
their
decisions
of
greater
importance
because
it
is
the
only
practical
and
available
instrument
in
the
hands
of
a
free
people
to
keep
such
judges
alive
to
the
reasonable
demands
of
those
they
serve
on
the
other
hand
the
danger
of
destroying
the
proper
influence
of
judicial
decisions
by
creating
unfounded
prejudices
against
the
courts
justifies
and
requires
that
unjust
attacks
shall
be
met
and
answered
courts
must
ultimately
rest
their
defense
upon
the
inherent
strength
of
the
opinions
they
deliver
as
the
ground
for
their
conclusions
and
must
trust
to
the
calm
and
deliberate
judgment
of
all
the
people
as
their
best
vindication
there
is
one
consideration
which
should
be
taken
into
account
by
the
good
people
who
carry
a
sound
proposition
to
an
excess
in
objecting
to
any
criticism
of
a
judges
decision
the
instinct
of
the
american
people
as
a
whole
is
sound
in
this
matter
they
will
not
subscribe
to
the
doctrine
that
any
public
servant
is
to
be
above
all
criticism
if
the
best
citizens
those
most
competent
to
express
their
judgment
in
such
matters
and
above
all
those
belonging
to
the
great
and
honorable
profession
of
the
bar
so
profoundly
influential
in
american
life
take
the
position
that
there
shall
be
no
criticism
of
a
judge
under
any
circumstances
their
view
will
not
be
accepted
by
the
american
people
as
a
whole
in
such
event
the
people
will
turn
to
and
tend
to
accept
as
justifiable
the
intemperate
and
improper
criticism
uttered
by
unworthy
agitators
surely
it
is
a
misfortune
to
leave
to
such
critics
a
function
right
in
itself
which
they
are
certain
to
abuse
just
and
temperate
criticism
when
necessary
is
a
safeguard
against
the
acceptance
by
the
people
as
a
whole
of
that
intemperate
antagonism
towards
the
judiciary
which
must
be
combated
by
every
rightthinking
man
and
which
if
it
became
widespread
among
the
people
at
large
would
constitute
a
dire
menace
to
the
republic
in
connection
with
the
delays
of
the
law
i
call
your
attention
and
the
attention
of
the
nation
to
the
prevalence
of
crime
among
us
and
above
all
to
the
epidemic
of
lynching
and
mob
violence
that
springs
up
now
in
one
part
of
our
country
now
in
another
each
section
north
south
east
or
west
has
its
own
faults
no
section
can
with
wisdom
spend
its
time
jeering
at
the
faults
of
another
section
it
should
be
busy
trying
to
amend
its
own
shortcomings
to
deal
with
the
crime
of
corruption
it
is
necessary
to
have
an
awakened
public
conscience
and
to
supplement
this
by
whatever
legislation
will
add
speed
and
certainty
in
the
execution
of
the
law
when
we
deal
with
lynching
even
mote
is
necessary
a
great
many
white
men
are
lynched
but
the
crime
is
peculiarly
frequent
in
respect
to
black
men
the
greatest
existing
cause
of
lynching
is
the
perpetration
especially
by
black
men
of
the
hideous
crime
of
rapethe
most
abominable
in
all
the
category
of
crimes
even
worse
than
murder
mobs
frequently
avenge
the
commission
of
this
crime
by
themselves
torturing
to
death
the
man
committing
it
thus
avenging
in
bestial
fashion
a
bestial
deed
and
reducing
themselves
to
a
level
with
the
criminal
lawlessness
grows
by
what
it
feeds
upon
and
when
mobs
begin
to
lynch
for
rape
they
speedily
extend
the
sphere
of
their
operations
and
lynch
for
many
other
kinds
of
crimes
so
that
twothirds
of
the
lynchings
are
not
for
rape
at
all
while
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
individuals
lynched
are
innocent
of
all
crime
governor
candler
of
georgia
stated
on
one
occasion
some
years
ago
i
can
say
of
a
verity
that
i
have
within
the
last
month
saved
the
lives
of
half
a
dozen
innocent
negroes
who
were
pursued
by
the
mob
and
brought
them
to
trial
in
a
court
of
law
in
which
they
were
acquitted
as
bishop
galloway
of
mississippi
has
finely
said
when
the
rule
of
a
mob
obtains
that
which
distinguishes
a
high
civilization
is
surrendered
the
mob
which
lynches
a
negro

charged
with
rape
will
in
a
little
while
lynch
a
white
man
suspected
of
crime
every
christian
patriot
in
america
needs
to
lift
up
his
voice
in
loud
and
eternal
protest
against
the
mob
spirit
that
is
threatening
the
integrity
of
this
republic
governor
jelks
of
alabama
has
recently
spoken
as
follows
the
lynching
of
any
person
for
whatever
crime
is
inexcusable
anywhereit
is
a
defiance
of
orderly
government
but
the
killing
of
innocent
people
under
any
provocation
is
infinitely
more
horrible
and
yet
innocent
people
are
likely
to
die
when
a
mobs
terrible
lust
is
once
aroused
the
lesson
is
this
no
good
citizen
can
afford
to
countenance
a
defiance
of
the
statutes
no
matter
what
the
provocation
the
innocent
frequently
suffer
and
it
is
my
observation
more
usually
suffer
than
the
guilty
the
white
people
of
the
south
indict
the
whole
colored
race
on
the
ground
that
even
the
better
elements
lend
no
assistance
whatever
in
ferreting
out
criminals
of
their
own
color
the
respectable
colored
people
must
learn
not
to
harbor
their
criminals
but
to
assist
the
officers
in
bringing
them
to
justice
this
is
the
larger
crime
and
it
provokes
such
atrocious
offenses
as
the
one
at
atlanta
the
two
races
can
never
get
on
until
there
is
an
understanding
on
the
part
of
both
to
make
common
cause
with
the
lawabiding
against
criminals
of
any
color
moreover
where
any
crime
committed
by
a
member
of
one
race
against
a
member
of
another
race
is
avenged
in
such
fashion
that
it
seems
as
if
not
the
individual
criminal
but
the
whole
race
is
attacked
the
result
is
to
exasperate
to
the
highest
degree
race
feeling
there
is
but
one
safe
rule
in
dealing
with
black
men
as
with
white
men
it
is
the
same
rule
that
must
be
applied
in
dealing
with
rich
men
and
poor
men
that
is
to
treat
each
man
whatever
his
color
his
creed
or
his
social
position
with
evenhanded
justice
on
his
real
worth
as
a
man
white
people
owe
it
quite
as
much
to
themselves
as
to
the
colored
race
to
treat
well
the
colored
man
who
shows
by
his
life
that
he
deserves
such
treatment
for
it
is
surely
the
highest
wisdom
to
encourage
in
the
colored
race
all
those
individuals
who
are
honest
industrious
lawabiding
and
who
therefore
make
good
and
safe
neighbors
and
citizens
reward
or
punish
the
individual
on
his
merits
as
an
individual
evil
will
surely
come
in
the
end
to
both
races
if
we
substitute
for
this
just
rule
the
habit
of
treating
all
the
members
of
the
race
good
and
bad
alike
there
is
no
question
of
social
equality
or
negro
domination
involved
only
the
question
of
relentlessly
punishing
bad
men
and
of
securing
to
the
good
man
the
right
to
his
life
his
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
his
happiness
as
his
own
qualities
of
heart
head
and
hand
enable
him
to
achieve
it
every
colored
man
should
realize
that
the
worst
enemy
of
his
race
is
the
negro
criminal
and
above
all
the
negro
criminal
who
commits
the
dreadful
crime
of
rape
and
it
should
be
felt
as
in
the
highest
degree
an
offense
against
the
whole
country
and
against
the
colored
race
in
particular
for
a
colored
man
to
fail
to
help
the
officers
of
the
law
in
hunting
down
with
all
possible
earnestness
and
zeal
every
such
infamous
offender
moreover
in
my
judgment
the
crime
of
rape
should
always
be
punished
with
death
as
is
the
case
with
murder
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape
should
be
made
a
capital
crime
at
least
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
provision
should
be
made
by
which
the
punishment
may
follow
immediately
upon
the
heels
of
the
offense
while
the
trial
should
be
so
conducted
that
the
victim
need
not
be
wantonly
shamed
while
giving
testimony
and
that
the
least
possible
publicity
shall
be
given
to
the
details
the
members
of
the
white
race
on
the
other
hand
should
understand
that
every
lynching
represents
by
just
so
much
a
loosening
of
the
bands
of
civilization
that
the
spirit
of
lynching
inevitably
throws
into
prominence
in
the
community
all
the
foul
and
evil
creatures
who
dwell
therein
no
man
can
take
part
in
the
torture
of
a
human
being
without
having
his
own
moral
nature
permanently
lowered
every
lynching
means
just
so
much
moral
deterioration
in
all
the
children
who
have
any
knowledge
of
it
and
therefore
just
so
much
additional
trouble
for
the
next
generation
of
americans
let
justice
be
both
sure
and
swift
but
let
it
be
justice
under
the
law
and
not
the
wild
and
crooked
savagery
of
a
mob
there
is
another
matter
which
has
a
direct
bearing
upon
this
matter
of
lynching
and
of
the
brutal
crime
which
sometimes
calls
it
forth
and
at
other
times
merely
furnishes
the
excuse
for
its
existence
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
our
people
as
a
whole
permanently
to
rise
by
treading
down
any
of
their
own
number
even
those
who
themselves
for
the
moment
profit
by
such
maltreatment
of
their
fellows
will
in
the
long
run
also
suffer
no
more
shortsighted
policy
can
be
imagined
than
in
the
fancied
interest
of
one
class
to
prevent
the
education
of
another
class
the
free
public
school
the
chance
for
each
boy
or
girl
to
get
a
good
elementary
education
lies
at
the
foundation
of
our
whole
political
situation
in
every
community
the
poorest
citizens
those
who
need
the
schools
most
would
be
deprived
of
them
if
they
only
received
school
facilities
proportioned
to
the
taxes
they
paid
this
is
as
true
of
one
portion
of
our
country
as
of
another
it
is
as
true
for
the
negro
as
for
the
white
man
the
white
man
if
he
is
wise
will
decline
to
allow
the
negroes
in
a
mass
to
grow
to
manhood
and
womanhood
without
education
unquestionably
education
such
as
is
obtained
in
our
public
schools
does
not
do
everything
towards
making
a
man
a
good
citizen
but
it
does
much
the
lowest
and
most
brutal
criminals
those
for
instance
who
commit
the
crime
of
rape
are
in
the
great
majority
men
who
have
had
either
no
education
or
very
little
just
as
they
are
almost
invariably
men
who
own
no
property
for
the
man
who
puts
money
by
out
of
his
earnings
like
the
man
who
acquires
education
is
usually
lifted
above
mere
brutal
criminality
of
course
the
best
type
of
education
for
the
colored
man
taken
as
a
whole
is
such
education
as
is
conferred
in
schools
like
hampton
and
tuskegee
where
the
boys
and
girls
the
young
men
and
young
women
are
trained
industrially
as
well
as
in
the
ordinary
public
school
branches
the
graduates
of
these
schools
turn
out
well
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
and
hardly
any
of
them
become
criminals
while
what
little
criminality
there
is
never
takes
the
form
of
that
brutal
violence
which
invites
lynch
law
every
graduate
of
these
schoolsand
for
the
matter
of
that
every
other
colored
man
or
womanwho
leads
a
life
so
useful
and
honorable
as
to
win
the
good
will
and
respect
of
those
whites
whose
neighbor
he
or
she
is
thereby
helps
the
whole
colored
race
as
it
can
be
helped
in
no
other
way
for
next
to
the
negro
himself
the
man
who
can
do
most
to
help
the
negro
is
his
white
neighbor
who
lives
near
him
and
our
steady
effort
should
be
to
better
the
relations
between
the
two
great
though
the
benefit
of
these
schools
has
been
to
their
colored
pupils
and
to
the
colored
people
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
the
benefit
has
not
been
at
least
as
great
to
the
white
people
among
whom
these
colored
pupils
live
after
they
graduate
be
it
remembered
furthermore
that
the
individuals
who
whether
from
folly
from
evil
temper
from
greed
for
office
or
in
a
spirit
of
mere
base
demagogy
indulge
in
the
inflammatory
and
incendiary
speeches
and
writings
which
tend
to
arouse
mobs
and
to
bring
about
lynching
not
only
thus
excite
the
mob
but
also
tend
by
what
criminologists
call
suggestion
greatly
to
increase
the
likelihood
of
a
repetition
of
the
very
crime
against
which
they
are
inveighing
when
the
mob
is
composed
of
the
people
of
one
race
and
the
man
lynched
is
of
another
race
the
men
who
in
their
speeches
and
writings
either
excite
or
justify
the
action
tend
of
course
to
excite
a
bitter
race
feeling
and
to
cause
the
people
of
the
opposite
race
to
lose
sight
of
the
abominable
act
of
the
criminal
himself
and
in
addition
by
the
prominence
they
give
to
the
hideous
deed
they
undoubtedly
tend
to
excite
in
other
brutal
and
depraved
natures
thoughts
of
committing
it
swift
relentless
and
orderly
punishment
under
the
law
is
the
only
way
by
which
criminality
of
this
type
can
permanently
be
supprest
in
dealing
with
both
labor
and
capital
with
the
questions
affecting
both
corporations
and
trades
unions
there
is
one
matter
more
important
to
remember
than
aught
else
and
that
is
the
infinite
harm
done
by
preachers
of
mere
discontent
these
are
the
men
who
seek
to
excite
a
violent
class
hatred
against
all
men
of
wealth
they
seek
to
turn
wise
and
proper
movements
for
the
better
control
of
corporations
and
for
doing
away
with
the
abuses
connected
with
wealth
into
a
campaign
of
hysterical
excitement
and
falsehood
in
which
the
aim
is
to
inflame
to
madness
the
brutal
passions
of
mankind
the
sinister
demagogs
and
foolish
visionaries
who
are
always
eager
to
undertake
such
a
campaign
of
destruction
sometimes
seek
to
associate
themselves
with
those
working
for
a
genuine
reform
in
governmental
and
social
methods
and
sometimes
masquerade
as
such
reformers
in
reality
they
are
the
worst
enemies
of
the
cause
they
profess
to
advocate
just
as
the
purveyors
of
sensational
slander
in
newspaper
or
magazine
are
the
worst
enemies
of
all
men
who
are
engaged
in
an
honest
effort
to
better
what
is
bad
in
our
social
and
governmental
conditions
to
preach
hatred
of
the
rich
man
as
such
to
carry
on
a
campaign
of
slander
and
invective
against
him
to
seek
to
mislead
and
inflame
to
madness
honest
men
whose
lives
are
hard
and
who
have
not
the
kind
of
mental
training
which
will
permit
them
to
appreciate
the
danger
in
the
doctrines
preachedall
this
is
to
commit
a
crime
against
the
body
politic
and
to
be
false
to
every
worthy
principle
and
tradition
of
american
national
life
moreover
while
such
preaching
and
such
agitation
may
give
a
livelihood
and
a
certain
notoriety
to
some
of
those
who
take
part
in
it
and
may
result
in
the
temporary
political
success
of
others
in

the
long
run
every
such
movement
will
either
fail
or
else
will
provoke
a
violent
reaction
which
will
itself
result
not
merely
in
undoing
the
mischief
wrought
by
the
demagog
and
the
agitator
but
also
in
undoing
the
good
that
the
honest
reformer
the
true
upholder
of
popular
rights
has
painfully
and
laboriously
achieved
corruption
is
never
so
rife
as
in
communities
where
the
demagog
and
the
agitator
bear
full
sway
because
in
such
communities
all
moral
bands
become
loosened
and
hysteria
and
sensationalism
replace
the
spirit
of
sound
judgment
and
fair
dealing
as
between
man
and
man
in
sheer
revolt
against
the
squalid
anarchy
thus
produced
men
are
sure
in
the
end
to
turn
toward
any
leader
who
can
restore
order
and
then
their
relief
at
being
free
from
the
intolerable
burdens
of
class
hatred
violence
and
demagogy
is
such
that
they
can
not
for
some
time
be
aroused
to
indignation
against
misdeeds
by
men
of
wealth
so
that
they
permit
a
new
growth
of
the
very
abuses
which
were
in
part
responsible
for
the
original
outbreak
the
one
hope
for
success
for
our
people
lies
in
a
resolute
and
fearless
but
sane
and
coolheaded
advance
along
the
path
marked
out
last
year
by
this
very
congress
there
must
be
a
stern
refusal
to
be
misled
into
following
either
that
base
creature
who
appeals
and
panders
to
the
lowest
instincts
and
passions
in
order
to
arouse
one
set
of
americans
against
their
fellows
or
that
other
creature
equally
base
but
no
baser
who
in
a
spirit
of
greed
or
to
accumulate
or
add
to
an
already
huge
fortune
seeks
to
exploit
his
fellow
americans
with
callous
disregard
to
their
welfare
of
soul
and
body
the
man
who
debauches
others
in
order
to
obtain
a
high
office
stands
on
an
evil
equality
of
corruption
with
the
man
who
debauches
others
for
financial
profit
and
when
hatred
is
sown
the
crop
which
springs
up
can
only
be
evil
the
plain
people
who
thinkthe
mechanics
farmers
merchants
workers
with
head
or
hand
the
men
to
whom
american
traditions
are
dear
who
love
their
country
and
try
to
act
decently
by
their
neighbors
owe
it
to
themselves
to
remember
that
the
most
damaging
blow
that
can
be
given
popular
government
is
to
elect
an
unworthy
and
sinister
agitator
on
a
platform
of
violence
and
hypocrisy
whenever
such
an
issue
is
raised
in
this
country
nothing
can
be
gained
by
flinching
from
it
for
in
such
case
democracy
is
itself
on
trial
popular
selfgovernment
under
republican
forms
is
itself
on
trial
the
triumph
of
the
mob
is
just
as
evil
a
thing
as
the
triumph
of
the
plutocracy
and
to
have
escaped
one
danger
avails
nothing
whatever
if
we
succumb
to
the
other
in
the
end
the
honest
man
whether
rich
or
poor
who
earns
his
own
living
and
tries
to
deal
justly
by
his
fellows
has
as
much
to
fear
from
the
insincere
and
unworthy
demagog
promising
much
and
performing
nothing
or
else
performing
nothing
but
evil
who
would
set
on
the
mob
to
plunder
the
rich
as
from
the
crafty
corruptionist
who
for
his
own
ends
would
permit
the
common
people
to
be
exploited
by
the
very
wealthy
if
we
ever
let
this
government
fall
into
the
hands
of
men
of
either
of
these
two
classes
we
shall
show
ourselves
false
to
americas
past
moreover
the
demagog
and
the
corruptionist
often
work
hand
in
hand
there
are
at
this
moment
wealthy
reactionaries
of
such
obtuse
morality
that
they
regard
the
public
servant
who
prosecutes
them
when
they
violate
the
law
or
who
seeks
to
make
them
bear
their
proper
share
of
the
public
burdens
as
being
even
more
objectionable
than
the
violent
agitator
who
hounds
on
the
mob
to
plunder
the
rich
there
is
nothing
to
choose
between
such
a
reactionary
and
such
an
agitator
fundamentally
they
are
alike
in
their
selfish
disregard
of
the
rights
of
others
and
it
is
natural
that
they
should
join
in
opposition
to
any
movement
of
which
the
aim
is
fearlessly
to
do
exact
and
even
justice
to
all
i
call
your
attention
to
the
need
of
passing
the
bill
limiting
the
number
of
hours
of
employment
of
railroad
employees
the
measure
is
a
very
moderate
one
and
i
can
conceive
of
no
serious
objection
to
it
indeed
so
far
as
it
is
in
our
power
it
should
be
our
aim
steadily
to
reduce
the
number
of
hours
of
labor
with
as
a
goal
the
general
introduction
of
an
eighthour
day
there
are
industries
in
which
it
is
not
possible
that
the
hours
of
labor
should
be
reduced
just
as
there
are
communities
not
far
enough
advanced
for
such
a
movement
to
be
for
their
good
or
if
in
the
tropics
so
situated
that
there
is
no
analogy
between
their
needs
and
ours
in
this
matter
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
for
instance
the
conditions
are
in
every
way
so
different
from
what
they
are
here
that
an
eighthour
day
would
be
absurd
just
as
it
is
absurd
so
far
as
the
isthmus
is
concerned
where
white
labor
can
not
be
employed
to
bother
as
to
whether
the
necessary
work
is
done
by
alien
black
men
or
by
alien
yellow
men
but
the
wageworkers
of
the
united
states
are
of
so
high
a
grade
that
alike
from
the
merely
industrial
standpoint
and
from
the
civic
standpoint
it
should
be
our
object
to
do
what
we
can
in
the
direction
of
securing
the
general
observance
of
an
eighthour
day
until
recently
the
eighthour
law
on
our
federal
statute
books
has
been
very
scantily
observed
now
however
largely
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
bureau
of
labor
it
is
being
rigidly
enforced
and
i
shall
speedily
be
able
to
say
whether
or
not
there
is
need
of
further
legislation
in
reference
thereto
for
our
purpose
is
to
see
it
obeyed
in
spirit
no
less
than
in
letter
half
holidays
during
summer
should
be
established
for
government
employees
it
is
as
desirable
for
wageworkers
who
toil
with
their
hands
as
for
salaried
officials
whose
labor
is
mental
that
there
should
be
a
reasonable
amount
of
holiday
the
congress
at
its
last
session
wisely
provided
for
a
truant
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
a
marked
step
in
advance
on
the
path
of
properly
caring
for
the
children
let
me
again
urge
that
the
congress
provide
for
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
conditions
of
child
labor
and
of
the
labor
of
women
in
the
united
states
more
and
more
our
people
are
growing
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
questions
which
are
not
merely
of
industrial
but
of
social
importance
outweigh
all
others
and
these
two
questions
most
emphatically
come
in
the
category
of
those
which
affect
in
the
most
farreaching
way
the
home
life
of
the
nation
the
horrors
incident
to
the
employment
of
young
children
in
factories
or
at
work
anywhere
are
a
blot
on
our
civilization
it
is
true
that
each
state
must
ultimately
settle
the
question
in
its
own
way
but
a
thorough
official
investigation
of
the
matter
with
the
results
published
broadcast
would
greatly
help
toward
arousing
the
public
conscience
and
securing
unity
of
state
action
in
the
matter
there
is
however
one
law
on
the
subject
which
should
be
enacted
immediately
because
there
is
no
need
for
an
investigation
in
reference
thereto
and
the
failure
to
enact
it
is
discreditable
to
the
national
government
a
drastic
and
thoroughgoing
childlabor
law
should
be
enacted
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territories
among
the
excellent
laws
which
the
congress
past
at
the
last
session
was
an
employers
liability
law
it
was
a
marked
step
in
advance
to
get
the
recognition
of
employers
liability
on
the
statute
books
but
the
law
did
not
go
far
enough
in
spite
of
all
precautions
exercised
by
employers
there
are
unavoidable
accidents
and
even
deaths
involved
in
nearly
every
line
of
business
connected
with
the
mechanic
arts
this
inevitable
sacrifice
of
life
may
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
but
it
can
not
be
completely
eliminated
it
is
a
great
social
injustice
to
compel
the
employee
or
rather
the
family
of
the
killed
or
disabled
victim
to
bear
the
entire
burden
of
such
an
inevitable
sacrifice
in
other
words
society
shirks
its
duty
by
laying
the
whole
cost
on
the
victim
whereas
the
injury
comes
from
what
may
be
called
the
legitimate
risks
of
the
trade
compensation
for
accidents
or
deaths
due
in
any
line
of
industry
to
the
actual
conditions
under
which
that
industry
is
carried
on
should
be
paid
by
that
portion
of
the
community
for
the
benefit
of
which
the
industry
is
carried
onthat
is
by
those
who
profit
by
the
industry
if
the
entire
trade
risk
is
placed
upon
the
employer
he
will
promptly
and
properly
add
it
to
the
legitimate
cost
of
production
and
assess
it
proportionately
upon
the
consumers
of
his
commodity
it
is
therefore
clear
to
my
mind
that
the
law
should
place
this
entire
risk
of
a
trade
upon
the
employer
neither
the
federal
law
nor
as
far
as
i
am
informed
the
state
laws
dealing
with
the
question
of
employers
liability
are
sufficiently
thoroughgoing
the
federal
law
should
of
course
include
employees
in
navyyards
arsenals
and
the
like
the
commission
appointed
by
the
president
october
at
the
request
of
both
the
anthracite
coal
operators
and
miners
to
inquire
into
consider
and
pass
upon
the
questions
in
controversy
in
connection
with
the
strike
in
the
anthracite
regions
of
pennsylvania
and
the
causes
out
of
which
the
controversy
arose
in
their
report
findings
and
award
exprest
the
belief
that
the
state
and
federal
governments
should
provide
the
machinery
for
what
may
be
called
the
compulsory
investigation
of
controversies
between
employers
and
employees
when
they
arise
this
expression
of
belief
is
deserving
of
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
and
the
enactment
of
its
provisions
into
law
a
bill
has
already
been
introduced
to
this
end
records
show
that
during
the
twenty
years
from
january
to
december
there
were
strikes
affecting
establishments
and
employees
were
thrown
out
of
employment
during
the
same
period
there
were
lockouts
involving
nearly
establishments
throwing
over
one
million
people
out
of
employment
these
strikes
and
lockouts
involved
an
estimated
loss
to
employees
of
and
to
employers
of
a
total
of
the
public
suffered
directly
and
indirectly
probably
as
great
additional
loss
but
the
money
loss
great
as
it
was
did
not
measure
the
anguish
and
suffering
endured
by
the
wives
and
children
of
employees
whose
pay
stopt
when
their
work
stopt
or
th
e
disastrous
effect
of
the
strike
or
lockout
upon
the
business
of
employers
or
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
products
and
the
inconvenience
and
loss
to
the
public
many
of
these
strikes
and
lockouts
would
not
have
occurred
had
the
parties
to
the
dispute
been
required
to
appear
before
an
unprejudiced
body
representing
the
nation
and
face
to
face
state
the
reasons
for
their
contention
in
most
instances
the
dispute
would
doubtless
be
found
to
be
due
to
a
misunderstanding
by
each
of
the
others
rights
aggravated
by
an
unwillingness
of
either
party
to
accept
as
true
the
statements
of
the
other
as
to
the
justice
or
injustice
of
the
matters
in
dispute
the
exercise
of
a
judicial
spirit
by
a
disinterested
body
representing
the
federal
government
such
as
would
be
provided
by
a
commission
on
conciliation
and
arbitration
would
tend
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
friendliness
and
conciliation
between
contending
parties
and
the
giving
each
side
an
equal
opportunity
to
present
fully
its
case
in
the
presence
of
the
other
would
prevent
many
disputes
from
developing
into
serious
strikes
or
lockouts
and
in
other
cases
would
enable
the
commission
to
persuade
the
opposing
parties
to
come
to
terms
in
this
age
of
great
corporate
and
labor
combinations
neither
employers
nor
employees
should
be
left
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
stronger
party
to
a
dispute
regardless
of
the
righteousness
of
their
respective
claims
the
proposed
measure
would
be
in
the
line
of
securing
recognition
of
the
fact
that
in
many
strikes
the
public
has
itself
an
interest
which
can
not
wisely
be
disregarded
an
interest
not
merely
of
general
convenience
for
the
question
of
a
just
and
proper
public
policy
must
also
be
considered
in
all
legislation
of
this
kind
it
is
well
to
advance
cautiously
testing
each
step
by
the
actual
results
the
step
proposed
can
surely
be
safely
taken
for
the
decisions
of
the
commission
would
not
bind
the
parties
in
legal
fashion
and
yet
would
give
a
chance
for
public
opinion
to
crystallize
and
thus
to
exert
its
full
force
for
the
right
it
is
not
wise
that
the
nation
should
alienate
its
remaining
coal
lands
i
have
temporarily
withdrawn
from
settlement
all
the
lands
which
the
geological
survey
has
indicated
as
containing
or
in
all
probability
containing
coal
the
question
however
can
be
properly
settled
only
by
legislation
which
in
my
judgment
should
provide
for
the
withdrawal
of
these
lands
from
sale
or
from
entry
save
in
certain
especial
circumstances
the
ownership
would
then
remain
in
the
united
states
which
should
not
however
attempt
to
work
them
but
permit
them
to
be
worked
by
private
individuals
under
a
royalty
system
the
government
keeping
such
control
as
to
permit
it
to
see
that
no
excessive
price
was
charged
consumers
it
would
of
course
be
as
necessary
to
supervise
the
rates
charged
by
the
common
carriers
to
transport
the
product
as
the
rates
charged
by
those
who
mine
it
and
the
supervision
must
extend
to
the
conduct
of
the
common
carriers
so
that
they
shall
in
no
way
favor
one
competitor
at
the
expense
of
another
the
withdrawal
of
these
coal
lands
would
constitute
a
policy
analogous
to
that
which
has
been
followed
in
withdrawing
the
forest
lands
from
ordinary
settlement
the
coal
like
the
forests
should
be
treated
as
the
property
of
the
public
and
its
disposal
should
be
under
conditions
which
would
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
public
as
a
whole
the
present
congress
has
taken
long
strides
in
the
direction
of
securing
proper
supervision
and
control
by
the
national
government
over
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
business
and
the
enormous
majority
of
corporations
of
any
size
are
engaged
in
interstate
business
the
passage
of
the
railway
rate
bill
and
only
to
a
less
degree
the
passage
of
the
pure
food
bill
and
the
provision
for
increasing
and
rendering
more
effective
national
control
over
the
beefpacking
industry
mark
an
important
advance
in
the
proper
direction
in
the
short
session
it
will
perhaps
be
difficult
to
do
much
further
along
this
line
and
it
may
be
best
to
wait
until
the
laws
have
been
in
operation
for
a
number
of
months
before
endeavoring
to
increase
their
scope
because
only
operation
will
show
with
exactness
their
merits
and
their
shortcomings
and
thus
give
opportunity
to
define
what
further
remedial
legislation
is
needed
yet
in
my
judgment
it
will
in
the
end
be
advisable
in
connection
with
the
packing
house
inspection
law
to
provide
for
putting
a
date
on
the
label
and
for
charging
the
cost
of
inspection
to
the
packers
all
these
laws
have
already
justified
their
enactment
the
interstate
commerce
law
for
instance
has
rather
amusingly
falsified
the
predictions
both
of
those
who
asserted
that
it
would
ruin
the
railroads
and
of
those
who
asserted
that
it
did
not
go
far
enough
and
would
accomplish
nothing
during
the
last
five
months
the
railroads
have
shown
increased
earnings
and
some
of
them
unusual
dividends
while
during
the
same
period
the
mere
taking
effect
of
the
law
has
produced
an
unprecedented
a
hitherto
unheard
of
number
of
voluntary
reductions
in
freights
and
fares
by
the
railroads
since
the
founding
of
the
commission
there
has
never
been
a
time
of
equal
length
in
which
anything
like
so
many
reduced
tariffs
have
been
put
into
effect
on
august
for
instance
two
days
before
the
new
law
went
into
effect
the
commission
received
notices
of
over
five
thousand
separate
tariffs
which
represented
reductions
from
previous
rates
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
with
the
passage
of
these
laws
it
will
be
possible
to
stop
progress
along
the
line
of
increasing
the
power
of
the
national
government
over
the
use
of
capital
interstate
commerce
for
example
there
will
ultimately
be
need
of
enlarging
the
powers
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
along
several
different
lines
so
as
to
give
it
a
larger
and
more
efficient
control
over
the
railroads
it
can
not
too
often
be
repeated
that
experience
has
conclusively
shown
the
impossibility
of
securing
by
the
actions
of
nearly
half
a
hundred
different
state
legislatures
anything
but
ineffective
chaos
in
the
way
of
dealing
with
the
great
corporations
which
do
not
operate
exclusively
within
the
limits
of
any
one
state
in
some
method
whether
by
a
national
license
law
or
in
other
fashion
we
must
exercise
and
that
at
an
early
date
a
far
more
complete
control
than
at
present
over
these
great
corporationsa
control
that
will
among
other
things
prevent
the
evils
of
excessive
overcapitalization
and
that
will
compel
the
disclosure
by
each
big
corporation
of
its
stockholders
and
of
its
properties
and
business
whether
owned
directly
or
through
subsidiary
or
affiliated
corporations
this
will
tend
to
put
a
stop
to
the
securing
of
inordinate
profits
by
favored
individuals
at
the
expense
whether
of
the
general
public
the
stockholders
or
the
wageworkers
our
effort
should
be
not
so
much
to
prevent
consolidation
as
such
but
so
to
supervise
and
control
it
as
to
see
that
it
results
in
no
harm
to
the
people
the
reactionary
or
ultraconservative
apologists
for
the
misuse
of
wealth
assail
the
effort
to
secure
such
control
as
a
step
toward
socialism
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
these
reactionaries
and
ultraconservatives
who
are
themselves
most
potent
in
increasing
socialistic
feeling
one
of
the
most
efficient
methods
of
averting
the
consequences
of
a
dangerous
agitation
which
is
per
cent
wrong
is
to
remedy
the
per
cent
of
evil
as
to
which
the
agitation
is
well
rounded
the
best
way
to
avert
the
very
undesirable
move
for
the
government
ownership
of
railways
is
to
secure
by
the
government
on
behalf
of
the
people
as
a
whole
such
adequate
control
and
regulation
of
the
great
interstate
common
carriers
as
will
do
away
with
the
evils
which
give
rise
to
the
agitation
against
them
so
the
proper
antidote
to
the
dangerous
and
wicked
agitation
against
the
men
of
wealth
as
such
is
to
secure
by
proper
legislation
and
executive
action
the
abolition
of
the
grave
abuses
which
actually
do
obtain
in
connection
with
the
business
use
of
wealth
under
our
present
systemor
rather
no
systemof
failure
to
exercise
any
adequate
control
at
all
some
persons
speak
as
if
the
exercise
of
such
governmental
control
would
do
away
with
the
freedom
of
individual
initiative
and
dwarf
individual
effort
this
is
not
a
fact
it
would
be
a
veritable
calamity
to
fail
to
put
a
premium
upon
individual
initiative
individual
capacity
and
effort
upon
the
energy
character
and
foresight
which
it
is
so
important
to
encourage
in
the
individual
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
deadening
and
degrading
effect
of
pure
socialism
and
especially
of
its
extreme
form
communism
and
the
destruction
of
individual
character
which
they
would
bring
about
are
in
part
achieved
by
the
wholly
unregulated
competition
which
results
in
a
single
individual
or
corporation
rising
at
the
expense
of
all
others
until
his
or
its
rise
effectually
checks
all
competition
and
reduces
former
competitors
to
a
position
of
utter
inferiority
and
subordination
in
enacting
and
enforcing
such
legislation
as
this
congress
already
has
to
its
credit
we
are
working
on
a
coherent
plan
with
the
steady
endeavor
to
secure
the
needed
reform
by
the
joint
action
of
the
moderate
men
the
plain
men
who
do
not
wish
anything
hysterical
or
dangerous
but
who
do
intend
to
deal
in
resolute
commonsense
fashion
with
the
real
and
great
evils
of
the
present
system
the
reactionaries
and
the
violent
extremists
show
symptoms
of
joining
hands
against
us
both
assert
for
instance
that
if
logical
we
should
go
to
government
ownership
of
railroads
and
the
like
the
reactionaries
because
on
such
an
issue
they
think
the
people
would
stand
with
them
while
the
extremists
care
rather
to
preach
discontent
and
agitation
than
to
achieve
solid
results
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
position
is
as
remote
from
that
of
the
bourbon
reactionary
as
from
that
of
the
impracticable
or
sinister
visionary
we
hold
that
the
government
should
not
conduct
the
business
of
the
nation
but
that
it
should
exercise
such
supervision
as
will
insure
its
being
conducted
in
the
interest
of
the
nation

our
aim
is
so
far
as
may
be
to
secure
for
all
decent
hard
working
men
equality
of
opportunity
and
equality
of
burden
the
actual
working
of
our
laws
has
shown
that
the
effort
to
prohibit
all
combination
good
or
bad
is
noxious
where
it
is
not
ineffective
combination
of
capital
like
combination
of
labor
is
a
necessary
element
of
our
present
industrial
system
it
is
not
possible
completely
to
prevent
it
and
if
it
were
possible
such
complete
prevention
would
do
damage
to
the
body
politic
what
we
need
is
not
vainly
to
try
to
prevent
all
combination
but
to
secure
such
rigorous
and
adequate
control
and
supervision
of
the
combinations
as
to
prevent
their
injuring
the
public
or
existing
in
such
form
as
inevitably
to
threaten
injuryfor
the
mere
fact
that
a
combination
has
secured
practically
complete
control
of
a
necessary
of
life
would
under
any
circumstances
show
that
such
combination
was
to
be
presumed
to
be
adverse
to
the
public
interest
it
is
unfortunate
that
our
present
laws
should
forbid
all
combinations
instead
of
sharply
discriminating
between
those
combinations
which
do
good
and
those
combinations
which
do
evil
rebates
for
instance
are
as
often
due
to
the
pressure
of
big
shippers
as
was
shown
in
the
investigation
of
the
standard
oil
company
and
as
has
been
shown
since
by
the
investigation
of
the
tobacco
and
sugar
trusts
as
to
the
initiative
of
big
railroads
often
railroads
would
like
to
combine
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
big
shipper
from
maintaining
improper
advantages
at
the
expense
of
small
shippers
and
of
the
general
public
such
a
combination
instead
of
being
forbidden
by
law
should
be
favored
in
other
words
it
should
be
permitted
to
railroads
to
make
agreements
provided
these
agreements
were
sanctioned
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
were
published
with
these
two
conditions
complied
with
it
is
impossible
to
see
what
harm
such
a
combination
could
do
to
the
public
at
large
it
is
a
public
evil
to
have
on
the
statute
books
a
law
incapable
of
full
enforcement
because
both
judges
and
juries
realize
that
its
full
enforcement
would
destroy
the
business
of
the
country
for
the
result
is
to
make
decent
railroad
men
violators
of
the
law
against
their
will
and
to
put
a
premium
on
the
behavior
of
the
wilful
wrongdoers
such
a
result
in
turn
tends
to
throw
the
decent
man
and
the
wilful
wrongdoer
into
close
association
and
in
the
end
to
drag
down
the
former
to
the
latters
level
for
the
man
who
becomes
a
lawbreaker
in
one
way
unhappily
tends
to
lose
all
respect
for
law
and
to
be
willing
to
break
it
in
many
ways
no
more
scathing
condemnation
could
be
visited
upon
a
law
than
is
contained
in
the
words
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
in
commenting
upon
the
fact
that
the
numerous
joint
traffic
associations
do
technically
violate
the
law
they
say
the
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
transmissouri
case
and
the
joint
traffic
association
case
has
produced
no
practical
effect
upon
the
railway
operations
of
the
country
such
associations
in
fact
exist
now
as
they
did
before
these
decisions
and
with
the
same
general
effect
in
justice
to
all
parties
we
ought
probably
to
add
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
our
interstate
railways
could
be
operated
with
due
regard
to
the
interest
of
the
shipper
and
the
railway
without
concerted
action
of
the
kind
afforded
through
these
associations
this
means
that
the
law
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
is
such
that
the
business
of
the
country
can
not
be
conducted
without
breaking
it
i
recommend
that
you
give
careful
and
early
consideration
to
this
subject
and
if
you
find
the
opinion
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
justified
that
you
amend
the
law
so
as
to
obviate
the
evil
disclosed
the
question
of
taxation
is
difficult
in
any
country
but
it
is
especially
difficult
in
ours
with
its
federal
system
of
government
some
taxes
should
on
every
ground
be
levied
in
a
small
district
for
use
in
that
district
thus
the
taxation
of
real
estate
is
peculiarly
one
for
the
immediate
locality
in
which
the
real
estate
is
found
again
there
is
no
more
legitimate
tax
for
any
state
than
a
tax
on
the
franchises
conferred
by
that
state
upon
street
railroads
and
similar
corporations
which
operate
wholly
within
the
state
boundaries
sometimes
in
one
and
sometimes
in
several
municipalities
or
other
minor
divisions
of
the
state
but
there
are
many
kinds
of
taxes
which
can
only
be
levied
by
the
general
government
so
as
to
produce
the
best
results
because
among
other
reasons
the
attempt
to
impose
them
in
one
particular
state
too
often
results
merely
in
driving
the
corporation
or
individual
affected
to
some
other
locality
or
other
state
the
national
government
has
long
derived
its
chief
revenue
from
a
tariff
on
imports
and
from
an
internal
or
excise
tax
in
addition
to
these
there
is
every
reason
why
when
next
our
system
of
taxation
is
revised
the
national
government
should
impose
a
graduated
inheritance
tax
and
if
possible
a
graduated
income
tax
the
man
of
great
wealth
owes
a
peculiar
obligation
to
the
state
because
he
derives
special
advantages
from
the
mere
existence
of
government
not
only
should
he
recognize
this
obligation
in
the
way
he
leads
his
daily
life
and
in
the
way
he
earns
and
spends
his
money
but
it
should
also
be
recognized
by
the
way
in
which
he
pays
for
the
protection
the
state
gives
him
on
the
one
hand
it
is
desirable
that
he
should
assume
his
full
and
proper
share
of
the
burden
of
taxation
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
as
necessary
that
in
this
kind
of
taxation
where
the
men
who
vote
the
tax
pay
but
little
of
it
there
should
be
clear
recognition
of
the
danger
of
inaugurating
any
such
system
save
in
a
spirit
of
entire
justice
and
moderation
whenever
we
as
a
people
undertake
to
remodel
our
taxation
system
along
the
lines
suggested
we
must
make
it
clear
beyond
peradventure
that
our
aim
is
to
distribute
the
burden
of
supporting
the
government
more
equitably
than
at
present
that
we
intend
to
treat
rich
man
and
poor
man
on
a
basis
of
absolute
equality
and
that
we
regard
it
as
equally
fatal
to
true
democracy
to
do
or
permit
injustice
to
the
one
as
to
do
or
permit
injustice
to
the
other
i
am
well
aware
that
such
a
subject
as
this
needs
long
and
careful
study
in
order
that
the
people
may
become
familiar
with
what
is
proposed
to
be
done
may
clearly
see
the
necessity
of
proceeding
with
wisdom
and
selfrestraint
and
may
make
up
their
minds
just
how
far
they
are
willing
to
go
in
the
matter
while
only
trained
legislators
can
work
out
the
project
in
necessary
detail
but
i
feel
that
in
the
near
future
our
national
legislators
should
enact
a
law
providing
for
a
graduated
inheritance
tax
by
which
a
steadily
increasing
rate
of
duty
should
be
put
upon
all
moneys
or
other
valuables
coming
by
gift
bequest
or
devise
to
any
individual
or
corporation
it
may
be
well
to
make
the
tax
heavy
in
proportion
as
the
individual
benefited
is
remote
of
kin
in
any
event
in
my
judgment
the
pro
rata
of
the
tax
should
increase
very
heavily
with
the
increase
of
the
amount
left
to
any
one
individual
after
a
certain
point
has
been
reached
it
is
most
desirable
to
encourage
thrift
and
ambition
and
a
potent
source
of
thrift
and
ambition
is
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
breadwinner
to
leave
his
children
well
off
this
object
can
be
attained
by
making
the
tax
very
small
on
moderate
amounts
of
property
left
because
the
prime
object
should
be
to
put
a
constantly
increasing
burden
on
the
inheritance
of
those
swollen
fortunes
which
it
is
certainly
of
no
benefit
to
this
country
to
perpetuate
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
ethical
propriety
of
the
government
thus
determining
the
conditions
upon
which
any
gift
or
inheritance
should
be
received
exactly
how
far
the
inheritance
tax
would
as
an
incident
have
the
effect
of
limiting
the
transmission
by
devise
or
gift
of
the
enormous
fortunes
in
question
it
is
not
necessary
at
present
to
discuss
it
is
wise
that
progress
in
this
direction
should
be
gradual
at
first
a
permanent
national
inheritance
tax
while
it
might
be
more
substantial
than
any
such
tax
has
hitherto
been
need
not
approximate
either
in
amount
or
in
the
extent
of
the
increase
by
graduation
to
what
such
a
tax
should
ultimately
be
this
species
of
tax
has
again
and
again
been
imposed
although
only
temporarily
by
the
national
government
it
was
first
imposed
by
the
act
of
july
when
the
makers
of
the
constitution
were
alive
and
at
the
head
of
affairs
it
was
a
graduated
tax
though
small
in
amount
the
rate
was
increased
with
the
amount
left
to
any
individual
exceptions
being
made
in
the
case
of
certain
close
kin
a
similar
tax
was
again
imposed
by
the
act
of
july
a
minimum
sum
of
one
thousand
dollars
in
personal
property
being
excepted
from
taxation
the
tax
then
becoming
progressive
according
to
the
remoteness
of
kin
the
warrevenue
act
of
june
provided
for
an
inheritance
tax
on
any
sum
exceeding
the
value
of
ten
thousand
dollars
the
rate
of
the
tax
increasing
both
in
accordance
with
the
amounts
left
and
in
accordance
with
the
legatees
remoteness
of
kin
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
succession
tax
imposed
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war
was
not
a
direct
tax
but
an
impost
or
excise
which
was
both
constitutional
and
valid
more
recently
the
court
in
an
opinion
delivered
by
mr
justice
white
which
contained
an
exceedingly
able
and
elaborate
discussion
of
the
powers
of
the
congress
to
impose
death
duties
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
inheritancetax
feature
of
the
warrevenue
act
of
in
its
incidents
and
apart
from
the
main
purpose
of
raising
revenue
an
income
tax
stands
on
an
entirely
different
footing
from
an
inheritance
tax
because
it
involves
no
question
of
the
perpetuation
of
fortunes
swollen
to
an
unhealthy
size
the
question
is
in
its
essence
a
question
of
the
proper
adjustment
of
burdens
to
benefits
as
the
law
now
stands
it
is
undoubtedly
difficult
to
devise
a
national
income
tax
which
shall
be
constitutional
but
whether
it
is
absolutely
impossible
is
another
question
and
if
possible
it
is
most
certainly
desirable
the
f
irst
purely
incometax
law
was
past
by
the
congress
in
but
the
most
important
law
dealing
with
the
subject
was
that
of
this
the
court
held
to
be
unconstitutional
the
question
is
undoubtedly
very
intricate
delicate
and
troublesome
the
decision
of
the
court
was
only
reached
by
one
majority
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
and
of
course
is
accepted
as
such
and
loyally
obeyed
by
all
good
citizens
nevertheless
the
hesitation
evidently
felt
by
the
court
as
a
whole
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
when
considered
together
with
the
previous
decisions
on
the
subject
may
perhaps
indicate
the
possibility
of
devising
a
constitutional
incometax
law
which
shall
substantially
accomplish
the
results
aimed
at
the
difficulty
of
amending
the
constitution
is
so
great
that
only
real
necessity
can
justify
a
resort
thereto
every
effort
should
be
made
in
dealing
with
this
subject
as
with
the
subject
of
the
proper
control
by
the
national
government
over
the
use
of
corporate
wealth
in
interstate
business
to
devise
legislation
which
without
such
action
shall
attain
the
desired
end
but
if
this
fails
there
will
ultimately
be
no
alternative
to
a
constitutional
amendment
it
would
be
impossible
to
overstate
though
it
is
of
course
difficult
quantitatively
to
measure
the
effect
upon
a
nations
growth
to
greatness
of
what
may
be
called
organized
patriotism
which
necessarily
includes
the
substitution
of
a
national
feeling
for
mere
local
pride
with
as
a
resultant
a
high
ambition
for
the
whole
country
no
country
can
develop
its
full
strength
so
long
as
the
parts
which
make
up
the
whole
each
put
a
feeling
of
loyalty
to
the
part
above
the
feeling
of
loyalty
to
the
whole
this
is
true
of
sections
and
it
is
just
as
true
of
classes
the
industrial
and
agricultural
classes
must
work
together
capitalists
and
wageworkers
must
work
together
if
the
best
work
of
which
the
country
is
capable
is
to
be
done
it
is
probable
that
a
thoroughly
efficient
system
of
education
comes
next
to
the
influence
of
patriotism
in
bringing
about
national
success
of
this
kind
our
federal
form
of
government
so
fruitful
of
advantage
to
our
people
in
certain
ways
in
other
ways
undoubtedly
limits
our
national
effectiveness
it
is
not
possible
for
instance
for
the
national
government
to
take
the
lead
in
technical
industrial
education
to
see
that
the
public
school
system
of
this
country
develops
on
all
its
technical
industrial
scientific
and
commercial
sides
this
must
be
left
primarily
to
the
several
states
nevertheless
the
national
government
has
control
of
the
schools
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
it
should
see
that
these
schools
promote
and
encourage
the
fullest
development
of
the
scholars
in
both
commercial
and
industrial
training
the
commercial
training
should
in
one
of
its
branches
deal
with
foreign
trade
the
industrial
training
is
even
more
important
it
should
be
one
of
our
prime
objects
as
a
nation
so
far
as
feasible
constantly
to
work
toward
putting
the
mechanic
the
wageworker
who
works
with
his
hands
on
a
higher
plane
of
efficiency
and
reward
so
as
to
increase
his
effectiveness
in
the
economic
world
and
the
dignity
the
remuneration
and
the
power
of
his
position
in
the
social
world
unfortunately
at
present
the
effect
of
some
of
the
work
in
the
public
schools
is
in
the
exactly
opposite
direction
if
boys
and
girls
are
trained
merely
in
literary
accomplishments
to
the
total
exclusion
of
industrial
manual
and
technical
training
the
tendency
is
to
unfit
them
for
industrial
work
and
to
make
them
reluctant
to
go
into
it
or
unfitted
to
do
well
if
they
do
go
into
it
this
is
a
tendency
which
should
be
strenuously
combated
our
industrial
development
depends
largely
upon
technical
education
including
in
this
term
all
industrial
education
from
that
which
fits
a
man
to
be
a
good
mechanic
a
good
carpenter
or
blacksmith
to
that
which
fits
a
man
to
do
the
greatest
engineering
feat
the
skilled
mechanic
the
skilled
workman
can
best
become
such
by
technical
industrial
education
the
farreaching
usefulness
of
institutes
of
technology
and
schools
of
mines
or
of
engineering
is
now
universally
acknowledged
and
no
less
farreaching
is
the
effect
of
a
good
building
or
mechanical
trades
school
a
textile
or
watchmaking
or
engraving
school
all
such
training
must
develop
not
only
manual
dexterity
but
industrial
intelligence
in
international
rivalry
this
country
does
not
have
to
fear
the
competition
of
pauper
labor
as
much
as
it
has
to
fear
the
educated
labor
of
specially
trained
competitors
and
we
should
have
the
education
of
the
hand
eye
and
brain
which
will
fit
us
to
meet
such
competition
in
every
possible
way
we
should
help
the
wageworker
who
toils
with
his
hands
and
who
must
we
hope
in
a
constantly
increasing
measure
also
toil
with
his
brain
under
the
constitution
the
national
legislature
can
do
but
little
of
direct
importance
for
his
welfare
save
where
he
is
engaged
in
work
which
permits
it
to
act
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
and
this
is
one
reason
why
i
so
earnestly
hope
that
both
the
legislative
and
judicial
branches
of
the
government
will
construe
this
clause
of
the
constitution
in
the
broadest
possible
manner
we
can
however
in
such
a
matter
as
industrial
training
in
such
a
matter
as
child
labor
and
factory
laws
set
an
example
to
the
states
by
enacting
the
most
advanced
legislation
that
can
wisely
be
enacted
for
the
district
of
columbia
the
only
other
persons
whose
welfare
is
as
vital
to
the
welfare
of
the
whole
country
as
is
the
welfare
of
the
wageworkers
are
the
tillers
of
the
soil
the
farmers
it
is
a
mere
truism
to
say
that
no
growth
of
cities
no
growth
of
wealth
no
industrial
development
can
atone
for
any
falling
off
in
the
character
and
standing
of
the
farming
population
during
the
last
few
decades
this
fact
has
been
recognized
with
everincreasing
clearness
there
is
no
longer
any
failure
to
realize
that
farming
at
least
in
certain
branches
must
become
a
technical
and
scientific
profession
this
means
that
there
must
be
open
to
farmers
the
chance
for
technical
and
scientific
training
not
theoretical
merely
but
of
the
most
severely
practical
type
the
farmer
represents
a
peculiarly
high
type
of
american
citizenship
and
he
must
have
the
same
chance
to
rise
and
develop
as
other
american
citizens
have
moreover
it
is
exactly
as
true
of
the
farmer
as
it
is
of
the
business
man
and
the
wageworker
that
the
ultimate
success
of
the
nation
of
which
he
forms
a
part
must
be
founded
not
alone
on
material
prosperity
but
upon
high
moral
mental
and
physical
development
this
education
of
the
farmerselfeducation
by
preference
but
also
education
from
the
outside
as
with
all
other
menis
peculiarly
necessary
here
in
the
united
states
where
the
frontier
conditions
even
in
the
newest
states
have
now
nearly
vanished
where
there
must
be
a
substitution
of
a
more
intensive
system
of
cultivation
for
the
old
wasteful
farm
management
and
where
there
must
be
a
better
business
organization
among
the
farmers
themselves
several
factors
must
cooperate
in
the
improvement
of
the
farmers
condition
he
must
have
the
chance
to
be
educated
in
the
widest
possible
sensein
the
sense
which
keeps
ever
in
view
the
intimate
relationship
between
the
theory
of
education
and
the
facts
of
life
in
all
education
we
should
widen
our
aims
it
is
a
good
thing
to
produce
a
certain
number
of
trained
scholars
and
students
but
the
education
superintended
by
the
state
must
seek
rather
to
produce
a
hundred
good
citizens
than
merely
one
scholar
and
it
must
be
turned
now
and
then
from
the
class
book
to
the
study
of
the
great
book
of
nature
itself
this
is
especially
true
of
the
farmer
as
has
been
pointed
out
again
and
again
by
all
observers
most
competent
to
pass
practical
judgment
on
the
problems
of
our
country
life
all
students
now
realize
that
education
must
seek
to
train
the
executive
powers
of
young
people
and
to
confer
more
real
significance
upon
the
phrase
dignity
of
labor
and
to
prepare
the
pupils
so
that
in
addition
to
each
developing
in
the
highest
degree
his
individual
capacity
for
work
they
may
together
help
create
a
right
public
opinion
and
show
in
many
ways
social
and
cooperative
spirit
organization
has
become
necessary
in
the
business
world
and
it
has
accomplished
much
for
good
in
the
world
of
labor
it
is
no
less
necessary
for
farmers
such
a
movement
as
the
grange
movement
is
good
in
itself
and
is
capable
of
a
wellnigh
infinite
further
extension
for
good
so
long
as
it
is
kept
to
its
own
legitimate
business
the
benefits
to
be
derived
by
the
association
of
farmers
for
mutual
advantage
are
partly
economic
and
partly
sociological
moreover
while
in
the
long
run
voluntary
efforts
will
prove
more
efficacious
than
government
assistance
while
the
farmers
must
primarily
do
most
for
themselves
yet
the
government
can
also
do
much
the
department
of
agriculture
has
broken
new
ground
in
many
directions
and
year
by
year
it
finds
how
it
can
improve
its
methods
and
develop
fresh
usefulness
its
constant
effort
is
to
give
the
governmental
assistance
in
the
most
effective
way
that
is
through
associations
of
farmers
rather
than
to
or
through
individual
farmers
it
is
also
striving
to
coordinate
its
work
with
the
agricultural
departments
of
the
several
states
and
so
far
as
its
own
work
is
educational
to
coordinate
it
with
the
work
of
other
educational
authorities
agricultural
education
is
necessarily
based
upon
general
education
but
our
agricultural
educational
institutions
are
wisely
specializing
themselves
making
their
courses
relate
to
the
actual
teaching
of
the
agricultural
and
kindred
sciences
to
young
country
people
or
young
city
people
who
wish
to
live
in
the
country
great
progress
has
already
been
made
among
farmers
by
the
creation
of
farmers
institutes
of
dairy
associations
of
breeders
associations
horticultural
associations
and
the
like
a
striking
example
of
how
the
government
and
the
farmers
can
cooperate
is
shown
in
connection
with
the
menace
offered
to
the
cotton
growers
of
the
southern
states
by
the
advance
of
the
boll
weevil
the
department
is
doing

all
it
can
to
organize
the
farmers
in
the
threatened
districts
just
as
it
has
been
doing
all
it
can
to
organize
them
in
aid
of
its
work
to
eradicate
the
cattle
fever
tick
in
the
south
the
department
can
and
will
cooperate
with
all
such
associations
and
it
must
have
their
help
if
its
own
work
is
to
be
done
in
the
most
efficient
style
much
is
now
being
done
for
the
states
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
great
plains
through
the
development
of
the
national
policy
of
irrigation
and
forest
preservation
no
government
policy
for
the
betterment
of
our
internal
conditions
has
been
more
fruitful
of
good
than
this
the
forests
of
the
white
mountains
and
southern
appalachian
regions
should
also
be
preserved
and
they
can
not
be
unless
the
people
of
the
states
in
which
they
lie
through
their
representatives
in
the
congress
secure
vigorous
action
by
the
national
government
i
invite
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
estimate
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
an
appropriation
to
enable
him
to
begin
the
preliminary
work
for
the
construction
of
a
memorial
amphitheater
at
arlington
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
in
its
national
encampment
has
urged
the
erection
of
such
an
amphitheater
as
necessary
for
the
proper
observance
of
memorial
day
and
as
a
fitting
monument
to
the
soldier
and
sailor
dead
buried
there
in
this
i
heartily
concur
and
commend
the
matter
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
i
am
well
aware
of
how
difficult
it
is
to
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
nevertheless
in
my
judgment
the
whole
question
of
marriage
and
divorce
should
be
relegated
to
the
authority
of
the
national
congress
at
present
the
wide
differences
in
the
laws
of
the
different
states
on
this
subject
result
in
scandals
and
abuses
and
surely
there
is
nothing
so
vitally
essential
to
the
welfare
of
the
nation
nothing
around
which
the
nation
should
so
bend
itself
to
throw
every
safeguard
as
the
home
life
of
the
average
citizen
the
change
would
be
good
from
every
standpoint
in
particular
it
would
be
good
because
it
would
confer
on
the
congress
the
power
at
once
to
deal
radically
and
efficiently
with
polygamy
and
this
should
be
done
whether
or
not
marriage
and
divorce
are
dealt
with
it
is
neither
safe
nor
proper
to
leave
the
question
of
polygamy
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
several
states
power
to
deal
with
it
should
be
conferred
on
the
national
government
when
home
ties
are
loosened
when
men
and
women
cease
to
regard
a
worthy
family
life
with
all
its
duties
fully
performed
and
all
its
responsibilities
lived
up
to
as
the
life
best
worth
living
then
evil
days
for
the
commonwealth
are
at
hand
there
are
regions
in
our
land
and
classes
of
our
population
where
the
birth
rate
has
sunk
below
the
death
rate
surely
it
should
need
no
demonstration
to
show
that
wilful
sterility
is
from
the
standpoint
of
the
nation
from
the
standpoint
of
the
human
race
the
one
sin
for
which
the
penalty
is
national
death
race
death
a
sin
for
which
there
is
no
atonement
a
sin
which
is
the
more
dreadful
exactly
in
proportion
as
the
men
and
women
guilty
thereof
are
in
other
respects
in
character
and
bodily
and
mental
powers
those
whom
for
the
sake
of
the
state
it
would
be
well
to
see
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
many
healthy
children
well
brought
up
in
homes
made
happy
by
their
presence
no
man
no
woman
can
shirk
the
primary
duties
of
life
whether
for
love
of
ease
and
pleasure
or
for
any
other
cause
and
retain
his
or
her
selfrespect
let
me
once
again
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
two
subjects
concerning
which
i
have
frequently
before
communicated
with
them
one
is
the
question
of
developing
american
shipping
i
trust
that
a
law
embodying
in
substance
the
views
or
a
major
part
of
the
views
exprest
in
the
report
on
this
subject
laid
before
the
house
at
its
last
session
will
be
past
i
am
well
aware
that
in
former
years
objectionable
measures
have
been
proposed
in
reference
to
the
encouragement
of
american
shipping
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proposed
measure
is
as
nearly
unobjectionable
as
any
can
be
it
will
of
course
benefit
primarily
our
seaboard
states
such
as
maine
louisiana
and
washington
but
what
benefits
part
of
our
people
in
the
end
benefits
all
just
as
government
aid
to
irrigation
and
forestry
in
the
west
is
really
of
benefit
not
only
to
the
rocky
mountain
states
but
to
all
our
country
if
it
prove
impracticable
to
enact
a
law
for
the
encouragement
of
shipping
generally
then
at
least
provision
should
be
made
for
better
communication
with
south
america
notably
for
fast
mail
lines
to
the
chief
south
american
ports
it
is
discreditable
to
us
that
our
business
people
for
lack
of
direct
communication
in
the
shape
of
lines
of
steamers
with
south
america
should
in
that
great
sister
continent
be
at
a
disadvantage
compared
to
the
business
people
of
europe
i
especially
call
your
attention
to
the
second
subject
the
condition
of
our
currency
laws
the
national
bank
act
has
ably
served
a
great
purpose
in
aiding
the
enormous
business
development
of
the
country
and
within
ten
years
there
has
been
an
increase
in
circulation
per
capita
from
to
for
several
years
evidence
has
been
accumulating
that
additional
legislation
is
needed
the
recurrence
of
each
crop
season
emphasizes
the
defects
of
the
present
laws
there
must
soon
be
a
revision
of
them
because
to
leave
them
as
they
are
means
to
incur
liability
of
business
disaster
since
your
body
adjourned
there
has
been
a
fluctuation
in
the
interest
on
call
money
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
and
the
fluctuation
was
even
greater
during
the
preceding
six
months
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
to
step
in
and
by
wise
action
put
a
stop
to
the
most
violent
period
of
oscillation
even
worse
than
such
fluctuation
is
the
advance
in
commercial
rates
and
the
uncertainty
felt
in
the
sufficiency
of
credit
even
at
high
rates
all
commercial
interests
suffer
during
each
crop
period
excessive
rates
for
call
money
in
new
york
attract
money
from
the
interior
banks
into
the
speculative
field
this
depletes
the
fund
that
would
otherwise
be
available
for
commercial
uses
and
commercial
borrowers
are
forced
to
pay
abnormal
rates
so
that
each
fall
a
tax
in
the
shape
of
increased
interest
charges
is
placed
on
the
whole
commerce
of
the
country
the
mere
statement
of
these
has
shows
that
our
present
system
is
seriously
defective
there
is
need
of
a
change
unfortunately
however
many
of
the
proposed
changes
must
be
ruled
from
consideration
because
they
are
complicated
are
not
easy
of
comprehension
and
tend
to
disturb
existing
rights
and
interests
we
must
also
rule
out
any
plan
which
would
materially
impair
the
value
of
the
united
states
per
cent
bonds
now
pledged
to
secure
circulations
the
issue
of
which
was
made
under
conditions
peculiarly
creditable
to
the
treasury
i
do
not
press
any
especial
plan
various
plans
have
recently
been
proposed
by
expert
committees
of
bankers
among
the
plans
which
are
possibly
feasible
and
which
certainly
should
receive
your
consideration
is
that
repeatedly
brought
to
your
attention
by
the
present
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
essential
features
of
which
have
been
approved
by
many
prominent
bankers
and
business
men
according
to
this
plan
national
banks
should
be
permitted
to
issue
a
specified
proportion
of
their
capital
in
notes
of
a
given
kind
the
issue
to
be
taxed
at
so
high
a
rate
as
to
drive
the
notes
back
when
not
wanted
in
legitimate
trade
this
plan
would
not
permit
the
issue
of
currency
to
give
banks
additional
profits
but
to
meet
the
emergency
presented
by
times
of
stringency
i
do
not
say
that
this
is
the
right
system
i
only
advance
it
to
emphasize
my
belief
that
there
is
need
for
the
adoption
of
some
system
which
shall
be
automatic
and
open
to
all
sound
banks
so
as
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
discrimination
and
favoritism
such
a
plan
would
tend
to
prevent
the
spasms
of
high
money
and
speculation
which
now
obtain
in
the
new
york
market
for
at
present
there
is
too
much
currency
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
and
its
accumulation
at
new
york
tempts
bankers
to
lend
it
at
low
rates
for
speculative
purposes
whereas
at
other
times
when
the
crops
are
being
moved
there
is
urgent
need
for
a
large
but
temporary
increase
in
the
currency
supply
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
this
question
concerns
business
men
generally
quite
as
much
as
bankers
especially
is
this
true
of
stockmen
farmers
and
business
men
in
the
west
for
at
present
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
the
difference
in
interest
rates
between
the
east
and
the
west
is
from
to
per
cent
whereas
in
canada
the
corresponding
difference
is
but
per
cent
any
plan
must
of
course
guard
the
interests
of
western
and
southern
bankers
as
carefully
as
it
guards
the
interests
of
new
york
or
chicago
bankers
and
must
be
drawn
from
the
standpoints
of
the
farmer
and
the
merchant
no
less
than
from
the
standpoints
of
the
city
banker
and
the
country
banker
the
law
should
be
amended
so
as
specifically
to
provide
that
the
funds
derived
from
customs
duties
may
be
treated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
he
treats
funds
obtained
under
the
internalrevenue
laws
there
should
be
a
considerable
increase
in
bills
of
small
denominations
permission
should
be
given
banks
if
necessary
under
settled
restrictions
to
retire
their
circulation
to
a
larger
amount
than
three
millions
a
month
i
most
earnestly
hope
that
the
bill
to
provide
a
lower
tariff
for
or
else
absolute
free
trade
in
philippine
products
will
become
a
law
no
harm
will
come
to
any
american
industry
and
while
there
will
be
some
small
but
real
material
benefit
to
the
filipinos
the
main
benefit
will
come
by
the
showing
made
as
to
our
purpose
to
do
all
in
our
power
for
their
welfare
so
far
our
action
in
the
philippines
has
been
abundantly
justified
not
mainly
and
indeed
not
primarily
because
of
the
added
dignity
it
has
given
us
as
a
nation
by
proving
that
we
are
capable
honorably
and
efficiently
to
bear
the
international
burdens
which
a
mighty
people
should
bear
but
even
more
because
of
the
immense
benefit
that
has
come
to
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
in
these
islands
we
are
stead
ily
introducing
both
liberty
and
order
to
a
greater
degree
than
their
people
have
ever
before
known
we
have
secured
justice
we
have
provided
an
efficient
police
force
and
have
put
down
ladronism
only
in
the
islands
of
leyte
and
samar
is
the
authority
of
our
government
resisted
and
this
by
wild
mountain
tribes
under
the
superstitious
inspiration
of
fakirs
and
pseudoreligions
leaders
we
are
constantly
increasing
the
measure
of
liberty
accorded
the
islanders
and
next
spring
if
conditions
warrant
we
shall
take
a
great
stride
forward
in
testing
their
capacity
for
selfgovernment
by
summoning
the
first
filipino
legislative
assembly
and
the
way
in
which
they
stand
this
test
will
largely
determine
whether
the
selfgovernment
thus
granted
will
be
increased
or
decreased
for
if
we
have
erred
at
all
in
the
philippines
it
has
been
in
proceeding
too
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
granting
a
large
measure
of
selfgovernment
we
are
building
roads
we
have
for
the
immeasurable
good
of
the
people
arranged
for
the
building
of
railroads
let
us
also
see
to
it
that
they
are
given
free
access
to
our
markets
this
nation
owes
no
more
imperative
duty
to
itself
and
mankind
than
the
duty
of
managing
the
affairs
of
all
the
islands
under
the
american
flagthe
philippines
porto
rico
and
hawaiiso
as
to
make
it
evident
that
it
is
in
every
way
to
their
advantage
that
the
flag
should
fly
over
them
american
citizenship
should
be
conferred
on
the
citizens
of
porto
rico
the
harbor
of
san
juan
in
porto
rico
should
be
dredged
and
improved
the
expenses
of
the
federal
court
of
porto
rico
should
be
met
from
the
federal
treasury
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
porto
rico
together
with
those
of
the
philippines
hawaii
and
our
other
insular
possessions
should
all
be
directed
under
one
executive
department
by
preference
the
department
of
state
or
the
department
of
war
the
needs
of
hawaii
are
peculiar
every
aid
should
be
given
the
islands
and
our
efforts
should
be
unceasing
to
develop
them
along
the
lines
of
a
community
of
small
freeholders
not
of
great
planters
with
coolietilled
estates
situated
as
this
territory
is
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
there
are
duties
imposed
upon
this
small
community
which
do
not
fall
in
like
degree
or
manner
upon
any
other
american
community
this
warrants
our
treating
it
differently
from
the
way
in
which
we
treat
territories
contiguous
to
or
surrounded
by
sister
territories
or
other
states
and
justifies
the
setting
aside
of
a
portion
of
our
revenues
to
be
expended
for
educational
and
internal
improvements
therein
hawaii
is
now
making
an
effort
to
secure
immigration
fit
in
the
end
to
assume
the
duties
and
burdens
of
full
american
citizenship
and
whenever
the
leaders
in
the
various
industries
of
those
islands
finally
adopt
our
ideals
and
heartily
join
our
administration
in
endeavoring
to
develop
a
middle
class
of
substantial
citizens
a
way
will
then
be
found
to
deal
with
the
commercial
and
industrial
problems
which
now
appear
to
them
so
serious
the
best
americanism
is
that
which
aims
for
stability
and
permanency
of
prosperous
citizenship
rather
than
immediate
returns
on
large
masses
of
capital
alaskas
needs
have
been
partially
met
but
there
must
be
a
complete
reorganization
of
the
governmental
system
as
i
have
before
indicated
to
you
i
ask
your
especial
attention
to
this
our
fellowcitizens
who
dwell
on
the
shores
of
puget
sound
with
characteristic
energy
are
arranging
to
hold
in
seattle
the
alaska
yukon
pacific
exposition
its
special
aims
include
the
upbuilding
of
alaska
and
the
development
of
american
commerce
on
the
pacific
ocean
this
exposition
in
its
purposes
and
scope
should
appeal
not
only
to
the
people
of
the
pacific
slope
but
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
at
large
alaska
since
it
was
bought
has
yielded
to
the
government
eleven
millions
of
dollars
of
revenue
and
has
produced
nearly
three
hundred
millions
of
dollars
in
gold
furs
and
fish
when
properly
developed
it
will
become
in
large
degree
a
land
of
homes
the
countries
bordering
the
pacific
ocean
have
a
population
more
numerous
than
that
of
all
the
countries
of
europe
their
annual
foreign
commerce
amounts
to
over
three
billions
of
dollars
of
which
the
share
of
the
united
states
is
some
seven
hundred
millions
of
dollars
if
this
trade
were
thoroughly
understood
and
pushed
by
our
manufacturers
and
producers
the
industries
not
only
of
the
pacific
slope
but
of
all
our
country
and
particularly
of
our
cottongrowing
states
would
be
greatly
benefited
of
course
in
order
to
get
these
benefits
we
must
treat
fairly
the
countries
with
which
we
trade
it
is
a
mistake
and
it
betrays
a
spirit
of
foolish
cynicism
to
maintain
that
all
international
governmental
action
is
and
must
ever
be
based
upon
mere
selfishness
and
that
to
advance
ethical
reasons
for
such
action
is
always
a
sign
of
hypocrisy
this
is
no
more
necessarily
true
of
the
action
of
governments
than
of
the
action
of
individuals
it
is
a
sure
sign
of
a
base
nature
always
to
ascribe
base
motives
for
the
actions
of
others
unquestionably
no
nation
can
afford
to
disregard
proper
considerations
of
selfinterest
any
more
than
a
private
individual
can
so
do
but
it
is
equally
true
that
the
average
private
individual
in
any
really
decent
community
does
many
actions
with
reference
to
other
men
in
which
he
is
guided
not
by
selfinterest
but
by
public
spirit
by
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
by
a
disinterested
purpose
to
do
good
to
others
and
to
raise
the
tone
of
the
community
as
a
whole
similarly
a
really
great
nation
must
often
act
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
often
does
act
toward
other
nations
in
a
spirit
not
in
the
least
of
mere
selfinterest
but
paying
heed
chiefly
to
ethical
reasons
and
as
the
centuries
go
by
this
disinterestedness
in
international
action
this
tendency
of
the
individuals
comprising
a
nation
to
require
that
nation
to
act
with
justice
toward
its
neighbors
steadily
grows
and
strengthens
it
is
neither
wise
nor
right
for
a
nation
to
disregard
its
own
needs
and
it
is
foolishand
may
be
wickedto
think
that
other
nations
will
disregard
theirs
but
it
is
wicked
for
a
nation
only
to
regard
its
own
interest
and
foolish
to
believe
that
such
is
the
sole
motive
that
actuates
any
other
nation
it
should
be
our
steady
aim
to
raise
the
ethical
standard
of
national
action
just
as
we
strive
to
raise
the
ethical
standard
of
individual
action
not
only
must
we
treat
all
nations
fairly
but
we
must
treat
with
justice
and
good
will
all
immigrants
who
come
here
under
the
law
whether
they
are
catholic
or
protestant
jew
or
gentile
whether
they
come
from
england
or
germany
russia
japan
or
italy
matters
nothing
all
we
have
a
right
to
question
is
the
mans
conduct
if
he
is
honest
and
upright
in
his
dealings
with
his
neighbor
and
with
the
state
then
he
is
entitled
to
respect
and
good
treatment
especially
do
we
need
to
remember
our
duty
to
the
stranger
within
our
gates
it
is
the
sure
mark
of
a
low
civilization
a
low
morality
to
abuse
or
discriminate
against
or
in
any
way
humiliate
such
stranger
who
has
come
here
lawfully
and
who
is
conducting
himself
properly
to
remember
this
is
incumbent
on
every
american
citizen
and
it
is
of
course
peculiarly
incumbent
on
every
government
official
whether
of
the
nation
or
of
the
several
states
i
am
prompted
to
say
this
by
the
attitude
of
hostility
here
and
there
assumed
toward
the
japanese
in
this
country
this
hostility
is
sporadic
and
is
limited
to
a
very
few
places
nevertheless
it
is
most
discreditable
to
us
as
a
people
and
it
may
be
fraught
with
the
gravest
consequences
to
the
nation
the
friendship
between
the
united
states
and
japan
has
been
continuous
since
the
time
over
half
a
century
ago
when
commodore
perry
by
his
expedition
to
japan
first
opened
the
islands
to
western
civilization
since
then
the
growth
of
japan
has
been
literally
astounding
there
is
not
only
nothing
to
parallel
it
but
nothing
to
approach
it
in
the
history
of
civilized
mankind
japan
has
a
glorious
and
ancient
past
her
civilization
is
older
than
that
of
the
nations
of
northern
europethe
nations
from
whom
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
chiefly
sprung
but
fifty
years
ago
japans
development
was
still
that
of
the
middle
ages
during
that
fifty
years
the
progress
of
the
country
in
every
walk
in
life
has
been
a
marvel
to
mankind
and
she
now
stands
as
one
of
the
greatest
of
civilized
nations
great
in
the
arts
of
war
and
in
the
arts
of
peace
great
in
military
in
industrial
in
artistic
development
and
achievement
japanese
soldiers
and
sailors
have
shown
themselves
equal
in
combat
to
any
of
whom
history
makes
note
she
has
produced
great
generals
and
mighty
admirals
her
fighting
men
afloat
and
ashore
show
all
the
heroic
courage
the
unquestioning
unfaltering
loyalty
the
splendid
indifference
to
hardship
and
death
which
marked
the
loyal
ronins
and
they
show
also
that
they
possess
the
highest
ideal
of
patriotism
japanese
artists
of
every
kind
see
their
products
eagerly
sought
for
in
all
lands
the
industrial
and
commercial
development
of
japan
has
been
phenomenal
greater
than
that
of
any
other
country
during
the
same
period
at
the
same
time
the
advance
in
science
and
philosophy
is
no
less
marked
the
admirable
management
of
the
japanese
red
cross
during
the
late
war
the
efficiency
and
humanity
of
the
japanese
officials
nurses
and
doctors
won
the
respectful
admiration
of
all
acquainted
with
the
facts
through
the
red
cross
the
japanese
people
sent
over
to
the
sufferers
of
san
francisco
and
the
gift
was
accepted
with
gratitude
by
our
people
the
courtesy
of
the
japanese
nationally
and
individually
has
become
proverbial
to
no
other
country
has
there
been
such
an
increasing
number
of
visitors
from
this
land
as
to
japan
in
return
japanese
have
come
here
in
great
numbers
they
are
welcome
socially
and
intellectually
in
all
our
colleges
and
institutions
of
higher
learning
in
all
our
professional
and
social
bodies
the
japanese
have
won
in
a
single
generation
the
right
to
stand
abreast
of
the
foremost
and
most
enlightened
peoples
of
europe
and
america
they
have
won
on
their

own
merits
and
by
their
own
exertions
the
right
to
treatment
on
a
basis
of
full
and
frank
equality
the
overwhelming
mass
of
our
people
cherish
a
lively
regard
and
respect
for
the
people
of
japan
and
in
almost
every
quarter
of
the
union
the
stranger
from
japan
is
treated
as
he
deserves
that
is
he
is
treated
as
the
stranger
from
any
part
of
civilized
europe
is
and
deserves
to
be
treated
but
here
and
there
a
most
unworthy
feeling
has
manifested
itself
toward
the
japanesethe
feeling
that
has
been
shown
in
shutting
them
out
from
the
common
schools
in
san
francisco
and
in
mutterings
against
them
in
one
or
two
other
places
because
of
their
efficiency
as
workers
to
shut
them
out
from
the
public
schools
is
a
wicked
absurdity
when
there
are
no
firstclass
colleges
in
the
land
including
the
universities
and
colleges
of
california
which
do
not
gladly
welcome
japanese
students
and
on
which
japanese
students
do
not
reflect
credit
we
have
as
much
to
learn
from
japan
as
japan
has
to
learn
from
us
and
no
nation
is
fit
to
teach
unless
it
is
also
willing
to
learn
throughout
japan
americans
are
well
treated
and
any
failure
on
the
part
of
americans
at
home
to
treat
the
japanese
with
a
like
courtesy
and
consideration
is
by
just
so
much
a
confession
of
inferiority
in
our
civilization
our
nation
fronts
on
the
pacific
just
as
it
fronts
on
the
atlantic
we
hope
to
play
a
constantly
growing
part
in
the
great
ocean
of
the
orient
we
wish
as
we
ought
to
wish
for
a
great
commercial
development
in
our
dealings
with
asia
and
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
we
should
permanently
have
such
development
unless
we
freely
and
gladly
extend
to
other
nations
the
same
measure
of
justice
and
good
treatment
which
we
expect
to
receive
in
return
it
is
only
a
very
small
body
of
our
citizens
that
act
badly
where
the
federal
government
has
power
it
will
deal
summarily
with
any
such
where
the
several
states
have
power
i
earnestly
ask
that
they
also
deal
wisely
and
promptly
with
such
conduct
or
else
this
small
body
of
wrongdoers
may
bring
shame
upon
the
great
mass
of
their
innocent
and
rightthinking
fellowsthat
is
upon
our
nation
as
a
whole
good
manners
should
be
an
international
no
less
than
an
individual
attribute
i
ask
fair
treatment
for
the
japanese
as
i
would
ask
fair
treatment
for
germans
or
englishmen
frenchmen
russians
or
italians
i
ask
it
as
due
to
humanity
and
civilization
i
ask
it
as
due
to
ourselves
because
we
must
act
uprightly
toward
all
men
i
recommend
to
the
congress
that
an
act
be
past
specifically
providing
for
the
naturalization
of
japanese
who
come
here
intending
to
become
american
citizens
one
of
the
great
embarrassments
attending
the
performance
of
our
international
obligations
is
the
fact
that
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
are
entirely
inadequate
they
fail
to
give
to
the
national
government
sufficiently
ample
power
through
united
states
courts
and
by
the
use
of
the
army
and
navy
to
protect
aliens
in
the
rights
secured
to
them
under
solemn
treaties
which
are
the
law
of
the
land
i
therefore
earnestly
recommend
that
the
criminal
and
civil
statutes
of
the
united
states
be
so
amended
and
added
to
as
to
enable
the
president
acting
for
the
united
states
government
which
is
responsible
in
our
international
relations
to
enforce
the
rights
of
aliens
under
treaties
even
as
the
law
now
is
something
can
be
done
by
the
federal
government
toward
this
end
and
in
the
matter
now
before
me
affecting
the
japanese
everything
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
do
will
be
done
and
all
of
the
forces
military
and
civil
of
the
united
states
which
i
may
lawfully
employ
will
be
so
employed
there
should
however
be
no
particle
of
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
the
national
government
completely
to
perform
and
enforce
its
own
obligations
to
other
nations
the
mob
of
a
single
city
may
at
any
time
perform
acts
of
lawless
violence
against
some
class
of
foreigners
which
would
plunge
us
into
war
that
city
by
itself
would
be
powerless
to
make
defense
against
the
foreign
power
thus
assaulted
and
if
independent
of
this
government
it
would
never
venture
to
perform
or
permit
the
performance
of
the
acts
complained
of
the
entire
power
and
the
whole
duty
to
protect
the
offending
city
or
the
offending
community
lies
in
the
hands
of
the
united
states
government
it
is
unthinkable
that
we
should
continue
a
policy
under
which
a
given
locality
may
be
allowed
to
commit
a
crime
against
a
friendly
nation
and
the
united
states
government
limited
not
to
preventing
the
commission
of
the
crime
but
in
the
last
resort
to
defending
the
people
who
have
committed
it
against
the
consequences
of
their
own
wrongdoing
last
august
an
insurrection
broke
out
in
cuba
which
it
speedily
grew
evident
that
the
existing
cuban
government
was
powerless
to
quell
this
government
was
repeatedly
asked
by
the
then
cuban
government
to
intervene
and
finally
was
notified
by
the
president
of
cuba
that
he
intended
to
resign
that
his
decision
was
irrevocable
that
none
of
the
other
constitutional
officers
would
consent
to
carry
on
the
government
and
that
he
was
powerless
to
maintain
order
it
was
evident
that
chaos
was
impending
and
there
was
every
probability
that
if
steps
were
not
immediately
taken
by
this
government
to
try
to
restore
order
the
representatives
of
various
european
nations
in
the
island
would
apply
to
their
respective
governments
for
armed
intervention
in
order
to
protect
the
lives
and
property
of
their
citizens
thanks
to
the
preparedness
of
our
navy
i
was
able
immediately
to
send
enough
ships
to
cuba
to
prevent
the
situation
from
becoming
hopeless
and
i
furthermore
dispatched
to
cuba
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
in
order
that
they
might
grapple
with
the
situation
on
the
ground
all
efforts
to
secure
an
agreement
between
the
contending
factions
by
which
they
should
themselves
come
to
an
amicable
understanding
and
settle
upon
some
modus
vivendisome
provisional
government
of
their
ownfailed
finally
the
president
of
the
republic
resigned
the
quorum
of
congress
assembled
failed
by
deliberate
purpose
of
its
members
so
that
there
was
no
power
to
act
on
his
resignation
and
the
government
came
to
a
halt
in
accordance
with
the
socalled
platt
amendment
which
was
embodied
in
the
constitution
of
cuba
i
thereupon
proclaimed
a
provisional
government
for
the
island
the
secretary
of
war
acting
as
provisional
governor
until
he
could
be
replaced
by
mr
magoon
the
late
minister
to
panama
and
governor
of
the
canal
zone
on
the
isthmus
troops
were
sent
to
support
them
and
to
relieve
the
navy
the
expedition
being
handled
with
most
satisfactory
speed
and
efficiency
the
insurgent
chiefs
immediately
agreed
that
their
troops
should
lay
down
their
arms
and
disband
and
the
agreement
was
carried
out
the
provisional
government
has
left
the
personnel
of
the
old
government
and
the
old
laws
so
far
as
might
be
unchanged
and
will
thus
administer
the
island
for
a
few
months
until
tranquillity
can
be
restored
a
new
election
properly
held
and
a
new
government
inaugurated
peace
has
come
in
the
island
and
the
harvesting
of
the
sugarcane
crop
the
great
crop
of
the
island
is
about
to
proceed
when
the
election
has
been
held
and
the
new
government
inaugurated
in
peaceful
and
orderly
fashion
the
provisional
government
will
come
to
an
end
i
take
this
opportunity
of
expressing
upon
behalf
of
the
american
people
with
all
possible
solemnity
our
most
earnest
hope
that
the
people
of
cuba
will
realize
the
imperative
need
of
preserving
justice
and
keeping
order
in
the
island
the
united
states
wishes
nothing
of
cuba
except
that
it
shall
prosper
morally
and
materially
and
wishes
nothing
of
the
cubans
save
that
they
shall
be
able
to
preserve
order
among
themselves
and
therefore
to
preserve
their
independence
if
the
elections
become
a
farce
and
if
the
insurrectionary
habit
becomes
confirmed
in
the
island
it
is
absolutely
out
of
the
question
that
the
island
should
continue
independent
and
the
united
states
which
has
assumed
the
sponsorship
before
the
civilized
world
for
cubas
career
as
a
nation
would
again
have
to
intervene
and
to
see
that
the
government
was
managed
in
such
orderly
fashion
as
to
secure
the
safety
of
life
and
property
the
path
to
be
trodden
by
those
who
exercise
selfgovernment
is
always
hard
and
we
should
have
every
charity
and
patience
with
the
cubans
as
they
tread
this
difficult
path
i
have
the
utmost
sympathy
with
and
regard
for
them
but
i
most
earnestly
adjure
them
solemnly
to
weigh
their
responsibilities
and
to
see
that
when
their
new
government
is
started
it
shall
run
smoothly
and
with
freedom
from
flagrant
denial
of
right
on
the
one
hand
and
from
insurrectionary
disturbances
on
the
other
the
second
international
conference
of
american
republics
held
in
mexico
in
the
years
provided
for
the
holding
of
the
third
conference
within
five
years
and
committed
the
fixing
of
the
time
and
place
and
the
arrangements
for
the
conference
to
the
governing
board
of
the
bureau
of
american
republics
composed
of
the
representatives
of
all
the
american
nations
in
washington
that
board
discharged
the
duty
imposed
upon
it
with
marked
fidelity
and
painstaking
care
and
upon
the
courteous
invitation
of
the
united
states
of
brazil
the
conference
was
held
at
rio
de
janeiro
continuing
from
the
d
of
july
to
the
th
of
august
last
many
subjects
of
common
interest
to
all
the
american
nations
were
discust
by
the
conference
and
the
conclusions
reached
embodied
in
a
series
of
resolutions
and
proposed
conventions
will
be
laid
before
you
upon
the
coming
in
of
the
final
report
of
the
american
delegates
they
contain
many
matters
of
importance
relating
to
the
extension
of
trade
the
increase
of
communication
the
smoothing
away
of
barriers
to
free
intercourse
and
the
promotion
of
a
better
knowledge
and
good
understanding
between
the
different
countries
represented
the
meetings
of
the
conference
were
harmonious
and
the
conclusions
were
reached
with
substantial
unanimity
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
in
the
successive
conferences
which
have
been
held
the
representatives

of
the
different
american
nations
have
been
learning
to
work
together
effectively
for
while
the
first
conference
in
washington
in
and
the
second
conference
in
mexico
in
occupied
many
months
with
much
time
wasted
in
an
unregulated
and
fruitless
discussion
the
third
conference
at
rio
exhibited
much
of
the
facility
in
the
practical
dispatch
of
business
which
characterizes
permanent
deliberative
bodies
and
completed
its
labors
within
the
period
of
six
weeks
originally
allotted
for
its
sessions
quite
apart
from
the
specific
value
of
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
conference
the
example
of
the
representatives
of
all
the
american
nations
engaging
in
harmonious
and
kindly
consideration
and
discussion
of
subjects
of
common
interest
is
itself
of
great
and
substantial
value
for
the
promotion
of
reasonable
and
considerate
treatment
of
all
international
questions
the
thanks
of
this
country
are
due
to
the
government
of
brazil
and
to
the
people
of
rio
de
janeiro
for
the
generous
hospitality
with
which
our
delegates
in
common
with
the
others
were
received
entertained
and
facilitated
in
their
work
incidentally
to
the
meeting
of
the
conference
the
secretary
of
state
visited
the
city
of
rio
de
janeiro
and
was
cordially
received
by
the
conference
of
which
he
was
made
an
honorary
president
the
announcement
of
his
intention
to
make
this
visit
was
followed
by
most
courteous
and
urgent
invitations
from
nearly
all
the
countries
of
south
america
to
visit
them
as
the
guest
of
their
governments
it
was
deemed
that
by
the
acceptance
of
these
invitations
we
might
appropriately
express
the
real
respect
and
friendship
in
which
we
hold
our
sister
republics
of
the
southern
continent
and
the
secretary
accordingly
visited
brazil
uruguay
argentina
chile
peru
panama
and
colombia
he
refrained
from
visiting
paraguay
bolivia
and
ecuador
only
because
the
distance
of
their
capitals
from
the
seaboard
made
it
impracticable
with
the
time
at
his
disposal
he
carried
with
him
a
message
of
peace
and
friendship
and
of
strong
desire
for
good
understanding
and
mutual
helpfulness
and
he
was
everywhere
received
in
the
spirit
of
his
message
the
members
of
government
the
press
the
learned
professions
the
men
of
business
and
the
great
masses
of
the
people
united
everywhere
in
emphatic
response
to
his
friendly
expressions
and
in
doing
honor
to
the
country
and
cause
which
he
represented
in
many
parts
of
south
america
there
has
been
much
misunderstanding
of
the
attitude
and
purposes
of
the
united
states
towards
the
other
american
republics
an
idea
had
become
prevalent
that
our
assertion
of
the
monroe
doctrine
implied
or
carried
with
it
an
assumption
of
superiority
and
of
a
right
to
exercise
some
kind
of
protectorate
over
the
countries
to
whose
territory
that
doctrine
applies
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
yet
that
impression
continued
to
be
a
serious
barrier
to
good
understanding
to
friendly
intercourse
to
the
introduction
of
american
capital
and
the
extension
of
american
trade
the
impression
was
so
widespread
that
apparently
it
could
not
be
reached
by
any
ordinary
means
it
was
part
of
secretary
roots
mission
to
dispel
this
unfounded
impression
and
there
is
just
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
succeeded
in
an
address
to
the
third
conference
at
rio
on
the
st
of
julyan
address
of
such
note
that
i
send
it
in
together
with
this
messagehe
said
we
wish
for
no
victories
but
those
of
peace
for
no
territory
except
our
own
for
no
sovereignty
except
the
sovereignty
over
ourselves
we
deem
the
independence
and
equal
rights
of
the
smallest
and
weakest
member
of
the
family
of
nations
entitled
to
as
much
respect
as
those
of
the
greatest
empire
and
we
deem
the
observance
of
that
respect
the
chief
guaranty
of
the
weak
against
the
oppression
of
the
strong
we
neither
claim
nor
desire
any
rights
or
privileges
or
powers
that
we
do
not
freely
concede
to
every
american
republic
we
wish
to
increase
our
prosperity
to
extend
our
trade
to
grow
in
wealth
in
wisdom
and
in
spirit
but
our
conception
of
the
true
way
to
accomplish
this
is
not
to
pull
down
others
and
profit
by
their
ruin
but
to
help
all
friends
to
a
common
prosperity
and
a
common
growth
that
we
may
all
become
greater
and
stronger
together
within
a
few
months
for
the
first
time
the
recognized
possessors
of
every
foot
of
soil
upon
the
american
continents
can
be
and
i
hope
will
be
represented
with
the
acknowledged
rights
of
equal
sovereign
states
in
the
great
world
congress
at
the
hague
this
will
be
the
worlds
formal
and
final
acceptance
of
the
declaration
that
no
part
of
the
american
continents
is
to
be
deemed
subject
to
colonization
let
us
pledge
ourselves
to
aid
each
other
in
the
full
performance
of
the
duty
to
humanity
which
that
accepted
declaration
implies
so
that
in
time
the
weakest
and
most
unfortunate
of
our
republics
may
come
to
march
with
equal
step
by
the
side
of
the
stronger
and
more
fortunate
let
us
help
each
other
to
show
that
for
all
the
races
of
men
the
liberty
for
which
we
have
fought
and
labored
is
the
twin
sister
of
justice
and
peace
let
us
unite
in
creating
and
maintaining
and
making
effective
an
allamerican
public
opinion
whose
power
shall
influence
international
conduct
and
prevent
international
wrong
and
narrow
the
causes
of
war
and
forever
preserve
our
free
lands
from
the
burden
of
such
armaments
as
are
massed
behind
the
frontiers
of
europe
and
bring
us
ever
nearer
to
the
perfection
of
ordered
liberty
so
shall
come
security
and
prosperity
production
and
trade
wealth
learning
the
arts
and
happiness
for
us
all
these
words
appear
to
have
been
received
with
acclaim
in
every
part
of
south
america
they
have
my
hearty
approval
as
i
am
sure
they
will
have
yours
and
i
can
not
be
wrong
in
the
conviction
that
they
correctly
represent
the
sentiments
of
the
whole
american
people
i
can
not
better
characterize
the
true
attitude
of
the
united
states
in
its
assertion
of
the
monroe
doctrine
than
in
the
words
of
the
distinguished
former
minister
of
foreign
affairs
of
argentina
doctor
drago
in
his
speech
welcoming
mr
root
at
buenos
ayres
he
spoke
of
the
traditional
policy
of
the
united
states
which
without
accentuating
superiority
or
seeking
preponderance
condemned
the
oppression
of
the
nations
of
this
part
of
the
world
and
the
control
of
their
destinies
by
the
great
powers
of
europe
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
in
the
great
city
of
buenos
ayres
upon
the
arches
which
spanned
the
streets
entwined
with
argentine
and
american
flags
for
the
reception
of
our
representative
there
were
emblazoned
not
only
the
names
of
washington
and
jefferson
and
marshall
but
also
in
appreciative
recognition
of
their
services
to
the
cause
of
south
american
independence
the
names
of
james
monroe
john
quincy
adams
henry
clay
and
richard
rush
we
take
especial
pleasure
in
the
graceful
courtesy
of
the
government
of
brazil
which
has
given
to
the
beautiful
and
stately
building
first
used
for
the
meeting
of
the
conference
the
name
of
palacio
monroe
our
grateful
acknowledgments
are
due
to
the
governments
and
the
people
of
all
the
countries
visited
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
courtesy
the
friendship
and
the
honor
shown
to
our
country
in
their
generous
hospitality
to
him
in
my
message
to
you
on
the
th
of
december
i
called
your
attention
to
the
embarrassment
that
might
be
caused
to
this
government
by
the
assertion
by
foreign
nations
of
the
right
to
collect
by
force
of
arms
contract
debts
due
by
american
republics
to
citizens
of
the
collecting
nation
and
to
the
danger
that
the
process
of
compulsory
collection
might
result
in
the
occupation
of
territory
tending
to
become
permanent
i
then
said
our
own
government
has
always
refused
to
enforce
such
contractual
obligations
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
by
an
appeal
to
arms
it
is
much
to
be
wisht
that
all
foreign
governments
would
take
the
same
view
this
subject
was
one
of
the
topics
of
consideration
at
the
conference
at
rio
and
a
resolution
was
adopted
by
that
conference
recommending
to
the
respective
governments
represented
to
consider
the
advisability
of
asking
the
second
peace
conference
at
the
hague
to
examine
the
question
of
the
compulsory
collection
of
public
debts
and
in
general
means
tending
to
diminish
among
nations
conflicts
of
purely
pecuniary
origin
this
resolution
was
supported
by
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
the
following
instructions
it
has
long
been
the
established
policy
of
the
united
states
not
to
use
its
armed
forces
for
the
collection
of
ordinary
contract
debts
due
to
its
citizens
by
other
governments
we
have
not
considered
the
use
of
force
for
such
a
purpose
consistent
with
that
respect
for
the
independent
sovereignty
of
other
members
of
the
family
of
nations
which
is
the
most
important
principle
of
international
law
and
the
chief
protection
of
weak
nations
against
the
oppression
of
the
strong
it
seems
to
us
that
the
practise
is
injurious
in
its
general
effect
upon
the
relations
of
nations
and
upon
the
welfare
of
weak
and
disordered
states
whose
development
ought
to
be
encouraged
in
the
interests
of
civilization
that
it
offers
frequent
temptation
to
bullying
and
oppression
and
to
unnecessary
and
unjustifiable
warfare
we
regret
that
other
powers
whose
opinions
and
sense
of
justice
we
esteem
highly
have
at
times
taken
a
different
view
and
have
permitted
themselves
though
we
believe
with
reluctance
to
collect
such
debts
by
force
it
is
doubtless
true
that
the
nonpayment
of
public
debts
may
be
accompanied
by
such
circumstances
of
fraud
and
wrongdoing
or
violation
of
treaties
as
to
justify
the
use
of
force
this
government
would
be
glad
to
see
an
international
consideration
of
the
subject
which
shall
discriminate
between
such
cases
and
the
simple
nonperformance
of
a
contract
with
a
private
person
and
a
resolution
in
favor
of
reliance
upon
peaceful
means
in
cases
of
the
latter
class
it
is
not
felt
however
that
the
conference
at
rio
should
undertake
to
make
such
a
discrimination
or
to
resolve
upon
such
a
rule
most
of
the
american
countries
are
still
debtor
nations
while
the

countries
of
europe
are
the
creditors
if
the
rio
conference
therefore
were
to
take
such
action
it
would
have
the
appearance
of
a
meeting
of
debtors
resolving
how
their
creditors
should
act
and
this
would
not
inspire
respect
the
true
course
is
indicated
by
the
terms
of
the
program
which
proposes
to
request
the
second
hague
conference
where
both
creditors
and
debtors
will
be
assembled
to
consider
the
subject
last
june
trouble
which
had
existed
for
some
time
between
the
republics
of
salvador
guatemala
and
honduras
culminated
in
wara
war
which
threatened
to
be
ruinous
to
the
countries
involved
and
very
destructive
to
the
commercial
interests
of
americans
mexicans
and
other
foreigners
who
are
taking
an
important
part
in
the
development
of
these
countries
the
thoroughly
good
understanding
which
exists
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
enabled
this
government
and
that
of
mexico
to
unite
in
effective
mediation
between
the
warring
republics
which
mediation
resulted
not
without
longcontinued
and
patient
effort
in
bringing
about
a
meeting
of
the
representatives
of
the
hostile
powers
on
board
a
united
states
warship
as
neutral
territory
and
peace
was
there
concluded
a
peace
which
resulted
in
the
saving
of
thousands
of
lives
and
in
the
prevention
of
an
incalculable
amount
of
misery
and
the
destruction
of
property
and
of
the
means
of
livelihood
the
rio
conference
past
the
following
resolution
in
reference
to
this
action
that
the
third
international
american
conference
shall
address
to
the
presidents
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
of
the
united
states
of
mexico
a
note
in
which
the
conference
which
is
being
held
at
rio
expresses
its
satisfaction
at
the
happy
results
of
their
mediation
for
the
celebration
of
peace
between
the
republics
of
guatemala
honduras
and
salvador
this
affords
an
excellent
example
of
one
way
in
which
the
influence
of
the
united
states
can
properly
be
exercised
for
the
benefit
of
the
peoples
of
the
western
hemisphere
that
is
by
action
taken
in
concert
with
other
american
republics
and
therefore
free
from
those
suspicions
and
prejudices
which
might
attach
if
the
action
were
taken
by
one
alone
in
this
way
it
is
possible
to
exercise
a
powerful
influence
toward
the
substitution
of
considerate
action
in
the
spirit
of
justice
for
the
insurrectionary
or
international
violence
which
has
hitherto
been
so
great
a
hindrance
to
the
development
of
many
of
our
neighbors
repeated
examples
of
united
action
by
several
or
many
american
republics
in
favor
of
peace
by
urging
cool
and
reasonable
instead
of
excited
and
belligerent
treatment
of
international
controversies
can
not
fail
to
promote
the
growth
of
a
general
public
opinion
among
the
american
nations
which
will
elevate
the
standards
of
international
action
strengthen
the
sense
of
international
duty
among
governments
and
tell
in
favor
of
the
peace
of
mankind
i
have
just
returned
from
a
trip
to
panama
and
shall
report
to
you
at
length
later
on
the
whole
subject
of
the
panama
canal
the
algeciras
convention
which
was
signed
by
the
united
states
as
well
as
by
most
of
the
powers
of
europe
supersedes
the
previous
convention
of
which
was
also
signed
both
by
the
united
states
and
a
majority
of
the
european
powers
this
treaty
confers
upon
us
equal
commercial
rights
with
all
european
countries
and
does
not
entail
a
single
obligation
of
any
kind
upon
us
and
i
earnestly
hope
it
may
be
speedily
ratified
to
refuse
to
ratify
it
would
merely
mean
that
we
forfeited
our
commercial
rights
in
morocco
and
would
not
achieve
another
object
of
any
kind
in
the
event
of
such
refusal
we
would
be
left
for
the
first
time
in
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
without
any
commercial
treaty
with
morocco
and
this
at
a
time
when
we
are
everywhere
seeking
new
markets
and
outlets
for
trade
the
destruction
of
the
pribilof
islands
fur
seals
by
pelagic
sealing
still
continues
the
herd
which
according
to
the
surveys
made
in
by
direction
of
the
congress
numbered
and
which
according
to
the
survey
of
both
american
and
canadian
commissioners
in
amounted
to
has
now
been
reduced
to
about
this
result
has
been
brought
about
by
canadian
and
some
other
sealing
vessels
killing
the
female
seals
while
in
the
water
during
their
annual
pilgrimage
to
and
from
the
south
or
in
search
of
food
as
a
rule
the
female
seal
when
killed
is
pregnant
and
also
has
an
unweaned
pup
on
land
so
that
for
each
skin
taken
by
pelagic
sealing
as
a
rule
three
lives
are
destroyedthe
mother
the
unborn
offspring
and
the
nursing
pup
which
is
left
to
starve
to
death
no
damage
whatever
is
done
to
the
herd
by
the
carefully
regulated
killing
on
land
the
custom
of
pelagic
sealing
is
solely
responsible
for
all
of
the
present
evil
and
is
alike
indefensible
from
the
economic
standpoint
and
from
the
standpoint
of
humanity
in
over
young
seals
were
found
dead
from
starvation
on
the
pribilof
islands
in
it
was
estimated
that
since
pelagic
sealing
began
upward
of
adult
female
seals
had
been
killed
at
sea
and
over
young
seals
had
died
of
starvation
as
the
result
the
revolting
barbarity
of
such
a
practise
as
well
as
the
wasteful
destruction
which
it
involves
needs
no
demonstration
and
is
its
own
condemnation
the
bering
sea
tribunal
which
sat
in
paris
in
and
which
decided
against
the
claims
of
the
united
states
to
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
waters
of
bering
sea
and
to
a
property
right
in
the
fur
seals
when
outside
of
the
threemile
limit
determined
also
upon
certain
regulations
which
the
tribunal
considered
sufficient
for
the
proper
protection
and
preservation
of
the
fur
seal
in
or
habitually
resorting
to
the
bering
sea
the
tribunal
by
its
regulations
established
a
close
season
from
the
st
of
may
to
the
st
of
july
and
excluded
all
killing
in
the
waters
within
miles
around
the
pribilof
islands
they
also
provided
that
the
regulations
which
they
had
determined
upon
with
a
view
to
the
protection
and
preservation
of
the
seals
should
be
submitted
every
five
years
to
new
examination
so
as
to
enable
both
interested
governments
to
consider
whether
in
the
light
of
past
experience
there
was
occasion
for
any
modification
thereof
the
regulations
have
proved
plainly
inadequate
to
accomplish
the
object
of
protection
and
preservation
of
the
fur
seals
and
for
a
long
time
this
government
has
been
trying
in
vain
to
secure
from
great
britain
such
revision
and
modification
of
the
regulations
as
were
contemplated
and
provided
for
by
the
award
of
the
tribunal
of
paris
the
process
of
destruction
has
been
accelerated
during
recent
years
by
the
appearance
of
a
number
of
japanese
vessels
engaged
in
pelagic
sealing
as
these
vessels
have
not
been
bound
even
by
the
inadequate
limitations
prescribed
by
the
tribunal
of
paris
they
have
paid
no
attention
either
to
the
close
season
or
to
the
sixtymile
limit
imposed
upon
the
canadians
and
have
prosecuted
their
work
up
to
the
very
islands
themselves
on
july
and
the
crews
from
several
japanese
vessels
made
raids
upon
the
island
of
st
paul
and
before
they
were
beaten
off
by
the
very
meager
and
insufficiently
armed
guard
they
succeeded
in
killing
several
hundred
seals
and
carrying
off
the
skins
of
most
of
them
nearly
all
the
seals
killed
were
females
and
the
work
was
done
with
frightful
barbarity
many
of
the
seals
appear
to
have
been
skinned
alive
and
many
were
found
half
skinned
and
still
alive
the
raids
were
repelled
only
by
the
use
of
firearms
and
five
of
the
raiders
were
killed
two
were
wounded
and
twelve
captured
including
the
two
wounded
those
captured
have
since
been
tried
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
an
attack
of
this
kind
had
been
wholly
unlookt
for
but
such
provision
of
vessels
arms
and
ammunition
will
now
be
made
that
its
repetition
will
not
be
found
profitable
suitable
representations
regarding
the
incident
have
been
made
to
the
government
of
japan
and
we
are
assured
that
all
practicable
measures
will
be
taken
by
that
country
to
prevent
any
recurrence
of
the
outrage
on
our
part
the
guard
on
the
island
will
be
increased
and
better
equipped
and
organized
and
a
better
revenuecutter
patrol
service
about
the
islands
will
be
established
next
season
a
united
states
war
vessel
will
also
be
sent
there
we
have
not
relaxed
our
efforts
to
secure
an
agreement
with
great
britain
for
adequate
protection
of
the
seal
herd
and
negotiations
with
japan
for
the
same
purpose
are
in
progress
the
laws
for
the
protection
of
the
seals
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
need
revision
and
amendment
only
the
islands
of
st
paul
and
st
george
are
now
in
terms
included
in
the
government
reservation
and
the
other
islands
are
also
to
be
included
the
landing
of
aliens
as
well
as
citizens
upon
the
islands
without
a
permit
from
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
for
any
purpose
except
in
case
of
stress
of
weather
or
for
water
should
be
prohibited
under
adequate
penalties
the
approach
of
vessels
for
the
excepted
purposes
should
be
regulated
the
authority
of
the
government
agents
on
the
islands
should
be
enlarged
and
the
chief
agent
should
have
the
powers
of
a
committing
magistrate
the
entrance
of
a
vessel
into
the
territorial
waters
surrounding
the
islands
with
intent
to
take
seals
should
be
made
a
criminal
offense
and
cause
of
forfeiture
authority
for
seizures
in
such
cases
should
be
given
and
the
presence
on
any
such
vessel
of
seals
or
sealskins
or
the
paraphernalia
for
taking
them
should
be
made
prima
facie
evidence
of
such
intent
i
recommend
what
legislation
is
needed
to
accomplish
these
ends
and
i
commend
to
your
attention
the
report
of
mr
sims
of
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
on
this
subject
in
case
we
are
compelled
to
abandon
the
hope
of
making
arrangements
with
other
governments
to
put
an
end
to
the
hideous
cruelty
now
incident
to
pelagic
sealing
it
will
be
a
question
for
your
serious
consideration
how
far
we
should
continue
to
protect
and
maintain
the
seal
herd
on
land
with
the
result
of
continuing
such
a
practise
and
whether
it
is
not
better
to
end
the
practice
by
exterminating
the
herd
ourselves
in
the
most
humane
way
possible
in
my
last
message

i
advised
you
that
the
emperor
of
russia
had
taken
the
initiative
in
bringing
about
a
second
peace
conference
at
the
hague
under
the
guidance
of
russia
the
arrangement
of
the
preliminaries
for
such
a
conference
has
been
progressing
during
the
past
year
progress
has
necessarily
been
slow
owing
to
the
great
number
of
countries
to
be
consulted
upon
every
question
that
has
arisen
it
is
a
matter
of
satisfaction
that
all
of
the
american
republics
have
now
for
the
first
time
been
invited
to
join
in
the
proposed
conference
the
close
connection
between
the
subjects
to
be
taken
up
by
the
red
cross
conference
held
at
geneva
last
summer
and
the
subjects
which
naturally
would
come
before
the
hague
conference
made
it
apparent
that
it
was
desirable
to
have
the
work
of
the
red
cross
conference
completed
and
considered
by
the
different
powers
before
the
meeting
at
the
hague
the
red
cross
conference
ended
its
labors
on
the
th
day
of
july
and
the
revised
and
amended
convention
which
was
signed
by
the
american
delegates
will
be
promptly
laid
before
the
senate
by
the
special
and
highly
appreciated
courtesy
of
the
governments
of
russia
and
the
netherlands
a
proposal
to
call
the
hague
conference
together
at
a
time
which
would
conflict
with
the
conference
of
the
american
republics
at
rio
de
janeiro
in
august
was
laid
aside
no
other
date
has
yet
been
suggested
a
tentative
program
for
the
conference
has
been
proposed
by
the
government
of
russia
and
the
subjects
which
it
enumerates
are
undergoing
careful
examination
and
consideration
in
preparation
for
the
conference
it
must
ever
be
kept
in
mind
that
war
is
not
merely
justifiable
but
imperative
upon
honorable
men
upon
an
honorable
nation
where
peace
can
only
be
obtained
by
the
sacrifice
of
conscientious
conviction
or
of
national
welfare
peace
is
normally
a
great
good
and
normally
it
coincides
with
righteousness
but
it
is
righteousness
and
not
peace
which
should
bind
the
conscience
of
a
nation
as
it
should
bind
the
conscience
of
an
individual
and
neither
a
nation
nor
an
individual
can
surrender
conscience
to
anothers
keeping
neither
can
a
nation
which
is
an
entity
and
which
does
not
die
as
individuals
die
refrain
from
taking
thought
for
the
interest
of
the
generations
that
are
to
come
no
less
than
for
the
interest
of
the
generation
of
today
and
no
public
men
have
a
right
whether
from
shortsightedness
from
selfish
indifference
or
from
sentimentality
to
sacrifice
national
interests
which
are
vital
in
character
a
just
war
is
in
the
long
run
far
better
for
a
nations
soul
than
the
most
prosperous
peace
obtained
by
acquiescence
in
wrong
or
injustice
moreover
though
it
is
criminal
for
a
nation
not
to
prepare
for
war
so
that
it
may
escape
the
dreadful
consequences
of
being
defeated
in
war
yet
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
even
to
be
defeated
in
war
may
be
far
better
than
not
to
have
fought
at
all
as
has
been
well
and
finely
said
a
beaten
nation
is
not
necessarily
a
disgraced
nation
but
the
nation
or
man
is
disgraced
if
the
obligation
to
defend
right
is
shirked
we
should
as
a
nation
do
everything
in
our
power
for
the
cause
of
honorable
peace
it
is
morally
as
indefensible
for
a
nation
to
commit
a
wrong
upon
another
nation
strong
or
weak
as
for
an
individual
thus
to
wrong
his
fellows
we
should
do
all
in
our
power
to
hasten
the
day
when
there
shall
be
peace
among
the
nationsa
peace
based
upon
justice
and
not
upon
cowardly
submission
to
wrong
we
can
accomplish
a
good
deal
in
this
direction
but
we
can
not
accomplish
everything
and
the
penalty
of
attempting
to
do
too
much
would
almost
inevitably
be
to
do
worse
than
nothing
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
fantastic
extremists
are
not
in
reality
leaders
of
the
causes
which
they
espouse
but
are
ordinarily
those
who
do
most
to
hamper
the
real
leaders
of
the
cause
and
to
damage
the
cause
itself
as
yet
there
is
no
likelihood
of
establishing
any
kind
of
international
power
of
whatever
sort
which
can
effectively
check
wrongdoing
and
in
these
circumstances
it
would
be
both
a
foolish
and
an
evil
thing
for
a
great
and
free
nation
to
deprive
itself
of
the
power
to
protect
its
own
rights
and
even
in
exceptional
cases
to
stand
up
for
the
rights
of
others
nothing
would
more
promote
iniquity
nothing
would
further
defer
the
reign
upon
earth
of
peace
and
righteousness
than
for
the
free
and
enlightened
peoples
which
though
with
much
stumbling
and
many
shortcomings
nevertheless
strive
toward
justice
deliberately
to
render
themselves
powerless
while
leaving
every
despotism
and
barbarism
armed
and
able
to
work
their
wicked
will
the
chance
for
the
settlement
of
disputes
peacefully
by
arbitration
now
depends
mainly
upon
the
possession
by
the
nations
that
mean
to
do
right
of
sufficient
armed
strength
to
make
their
purpose
effective
the
united
states
navy
is
the
surest
guarantor
of
peace
which
this
country
possesses
it
is
earnestly
to
be
wisht
that
we
would
profit
by
the
teachings
of
history
in
this
matter
a
strong
and
wise
people
will
study
its
own
failures
no
less
than
its
triumphs
for
there
is
wisdom
to
be
learned
from
the
study
of
both
of
the
mistake
as
well
as
of
the
success
for
this
purpose
nothing
could
be
more
instructive
than
a
rational
study
of
the
war
of
as
it
is
told
for
instance
by
captain
mahan
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
that
war
could
have
been
avoided
if
during
the
preceding
twelve
years
a
navy
relatively
as
strong
as
that
which
this
country
now
has
had
been
built
up
and
an
army
provided
relatively
as
good
as
that
which
the
country
now
has
there
never
would
have
been
the
slightest
necessity
of
fighting
the
war
and
if
the
necessity
had
arisen
the
war
would
under
such
circumstances
have
ended
with
our
speedy
and
overwhelming
triumph
but
our
people
during
those
twelve
years
refused
to
make
any
preparations
whatever
regarding
either
the
army
or
the
navy
they
saved
a
million
or
two
of
dollars
by
so
doing
and
in
mere
money
paid
a
hundredfold
for
each
million
they
thus
saved
during
the
three
years
of
war
which
followeda
war
which
brought
untold
suffering
upon
our
people
which
at
one
time
threatened
the
gravest
national
disaster
and
which
in
spite
of
the
necessity
of
waging
it
resulted
merely
in
what
was
in
effect
a
drawn
battle
while
the
balance
of
defeat
and
triumph
was
almost
even
i
do
not
ask
that
we
continue
to
increase
our
navy
i
ask
merely
that
it
be
maintained
at
its
present
strength
and
this
can
be
done
only
if
we
replace
the
obsolete
and
outworn
ships
by
new
and
good
ones
the
equals
of
any
afloat
in
any
navy
to
stop
building
ships
for
one
year
means
that
for
that
year
the
navy
goes
back
instead
of
forward
the
old
battle
ship
texas
for
instance
would
now
be
of
little
service
in
a
standup
fight
with
a
powerful
adversary
the
old
doubleturret
monitors
have
outworn
their
usefulness
while
it
was
a
waste
of
money
to
build
the
modern
singleturret
monitors
all
these
ships
should
be
replaced
by
others
and
this
can
be
done
by
a
wellsettled
program
of
providing
for
the
building
each
year
of
at
least
one
firstclass
battle
ship
equal
in
size
and
speed
to
any
that
any
nation
is
at
the
same
time
building
the
armament
presumably
to
consist
of
as
large
a
number
as
possible
of
very
heavy
guns
of
one
caliber
together
with
smaller
guns
to
repel
torpedo
attack
while
there
should
be
heavy
armor
turbine
engines
and
in
short
every
modern
device
of
course
from
time
to
time
cruisers
colliers
torpedoboat
destroyers
or
torpedo
boats
will
have
to
be
built
also
all
this
be
it
remembered
would
not
increase
our
navy
but
would
merely
keep
it
at
its
present
strength
equally
of
course
the
ships
will
be
absolutely
useless
if
the
men
aboard
them
are
not
so
trained
that
they
can
get
the
best
possible
service
out
of
the
formidable
but
delicate
and
complicated
mechanisms
intrusted
to
their
care
the
marksmanship
of
our
men
has
so
improved
during
the
last
five
years
that
i
deem
it
within
bounds
to
say
that
the
navy
is
more
than
twice
as
efficient
ship
for
ship
as
half
a
decade
ago
the
navy
can
only
attain
proper
efficiency
if
enough
officers
and
men
are
provided
and
if
these
officers
and
men
are
given
the
chance
and
required
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
stay
continually
at
sea
and
to
exercise
the
fleets
singly
and
above
all
in
squadron
the
exercise
to
be
of
every
kind
and
to
include
unceasing
practise
at
the
guns
conducted
under
conditions
that
will
test
marksmanship
in
time
of
war
in
both
the
army
and
the
navy
there
is
urgent
need
that
everything
possible
should
be
done
to
maintain
the
highest
standard
for
the
personnel
alike
as
regards
the
officers
and
the
enlisted
men
i
do
not
believe
that
in
any
service
there
is
a
finer
body
of
enlisted
men
and
of
junior
officer
than
we
have
in
both
the
army
and
the
navy
including
the
marine
corps
all
possible
encouragement
to
the
enlisted
men
should
be
given
in
pay
and
otherwise
and
everything
practicable
done
to
render
the
service
attractive
to
men
of
the
right
type
they
should
be
held
to
the
strictest
discharge
of
their
duty
and
in
them
a
spirit
should
be
encouraged
which
demands
not
the
mere
performance
of
duty
but
the
performance
of
far
more
than
duty
if
it
conduces
to
the
honor
and
the
interest
of
the
american
nation
and
in
return
the
amplest
consideration
should
be
theirs
west
point
and
annapolis
already
turn
out
excellent
officers
we
do
not
need
to
have
these
schools
made
more
scholastic
on
the
contrary
we
should
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
aim
of
each
school
is
to
turn
out
a
man
who
shall
be
above
everything
else
a
fighting
man
in
the
army
in
particular
it
is
not
necessary
that
either
the
cavalry
or
infantry
officer
should
have
special
mathematical
ability
probably
in
both
schools
the
best
part
of
the
education
is
the
high
standard
of
character
and
of
professional
morale
which
it
confers
but
in
both
services
there
is
urgent
need
for
the
establishment
of
a
principle
of
selection
which
will
eliminate
men
after
a
certain
age
if
they
can
not
be
promoted
from
the
subordinate
ranks
and
which
will
bring
into
the
higher
ranks
fewer
men
and
these

at
an
earlier
age
this
principle
of
selection
will
be
objected
to
by
good
men
of
mediocre
capacity
who
are
fitted
to
do
well
while
young
in
the
lower
positions
but
who
are
not
fitted
to
do
well
when
at
an
advanced
age
they
come
into
positions
of
command
and
of
great
responsibility
but
the
desire
of
these
men
to
be
promoted
to
positions
which
they
are
not
competent
to
fill
should
not
weigh
against
the
interest
of
the
navy
and
the
country
at
present
our
men
especially
in
the
navy
are
kept
far
too
long
in
the
junior
grades
and
then
at
much
too
advanced
an
age
are
put
quickly
through
the
senior
grades
often
not
attaining
to
these
senior
grades
until
they
are
too
old
to
be
of
real
use
in
them
and
if
they
are
of
real
use
being
put
through
them
so
quickly
that
little
benefit
to
the
navy
comes
from
their
having
been
in
them
at
all
the
navy
has
one
great
advantage
over
the
army
in
the
fact
that
the
officers
of
high
rank
are
actually
trained
in
the
continual
performance
of
their
duties
that
is
in
the
management
of
the
battle
ships
and
armored
cruisers
gathered
into
fleets
this
is
not
true
of
the
army
officers
who
rarely
have
corresponding
chances
to
exercise
command
over
troops
under
service
conditions
the
conduct
of
the
spanish
war
showed
the
lamentable
loss
of
life
the
useless
extravagance
and
the
inefficiency
certain
to
result
if
during
peace
the
high
officials
of
the
war
and
navy
departments
are
praised
and
rewarded
only
if
they
save
money
at
no
matter
what
cost
to
the
efficiency
of
the
service
and
if
the
higher
officers
are
given
no
chance
whatever
to
exercise
and
practise
command
for
years
prior
to
the
spanish
war
the
secretaries
of
war
were
praised
chiefly
if
they
practised
economy
which
economy
especially
in
connection
with
the
quartermaster
commissary
and
medical
departments
was
directly
responsible
for
most
of
the
mismanagement
that
occurred
in
the
war
itselfand
parenthetically
be
it
observed
that
the
very
people
who
clamored
for
the
misdirected
economy
in
the
first
place
were
foremost
to
denounce
the
mismanagement
loss
and
suffering
which
were
primarily
due
to
this
same
misdirected
economy
and
to
the
lack
of
preparation
it
involved
there
should
soon
be
an
increase
in
the
number
of
men
for
our
coast
defenses
these
men
should
be
of
the
right
type
and
properly
trained
and
there
should
therefore
be
an
increase
of
pay
for
certain
skilled
grades
especially
in
the
coast
artillery
money
should
be
appropriated
to
permit
troops
to
be
massed
in
body
and
exercised
in
maneuvers
particularly
in
marching
such
exercise
during
the
summer
just
past
has
been
of
incalculable
benefit
to
the
army
and
should
under
no
circumstances
be
discontinued
if
on
these
practise
marches
and
in
these
maneuvers
elderly
officers
prove
unable
to
bear
the
strain
they
should
be
retired
at
once
for
the
fact
is
conclusive
as
to
their
unfitness
for
war
that
is
for
the
only
purpose
because
of
which
they
should
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
service
it
is
a
real
misfortune
to
have
scores
of
small
company
or
regimental
posts
scattered
throughout
the
country
the
army
should
be
gathered
in
a
few
brigade
or
division
posts
and
the
generals
should
be
practised
in
handling
the
men
in
masses
neglect
to
provide
for
all
of
this
means
to
incur
the
risk
of
future
disaster
and
disgrace
the
readiness
and
efficiency
of
both
the
army
and
navy
in
dealing
with
the
recent
sudden
crisis
in
cuba
illustrate
afresh
their
value
to
the
nation
this
readiness
and
efficiency
would
have
been
very
much
less
had
it
not
been
for
the
existence
of
the
general
staff
in
the
army
and
the
general
board
in
the
navy
both
are
essential
to
the
proper
development
and
use
of
our
military
forces
afloat
and
ashore
the
troops
that
were
sent
to
cuba
were
handled
flawlessly
it
was
the
swiftest
mobilization
and
dispatch
of
troops
over
sea
ever
accomplished
by
our
government
the
expedition
landed
completely
equipped
and
ready
for
immediate
service
several
of
its
organizations
hardly
remaining
in
havana
over
night
before
splitting
up
into
detachments
and
going
to
their
several
posts
it
was
a
fine
demonstration
of
the
value
and
efficiency
of
the
general
staff
similarly
it
was
owing
in
large
part
to
the
general
board
that
the
navy
was
able
at
the
outset
to
meet
the
cuban
crisis
with
such
instant
efficiency
ship
after
ship
appearing
on
the
shortest
notice
at
any
threatened
point
while
the
marine
corps
in
particular
performed
indispensable
service
the
army
and
navy
war
colleges
are
of
incalculable
value
to
the
two
services
and
they
cooperate
with
constantly
increasing
efficiency
and
importance
the
congress
has
most
wisely
provided
for
a
national
board
for
the
promotion
of
rifle
practise
excellent
results
have
already
come
from
this
law
but
it
does
not
go
far
enough
our
regular
army
is
so
small
that
in
any
great
war
we
should
have
to
trust
mainly
to
volunteers
and
in
such
event
these
volunteers
should
already
know
how
to
shoot
for
if
a
soldier
has
the
fighting
edge
and
ability
to
take
care
of
himself
in
the
open
his
efficiency
on
the
line
of
battle
is
almost
directly
proportionate
to
excellence
in
marksmanship
we
should
establish
shooting
galleries
in
all
the
large
public
and
military
schools
should
maintain
national
target
ranges
in
different
parts
of
the
country
and
should
in
every
way
encourage
the
formation
of
rifle
clubs
throughout
all
parts
of
the
land
the
little
republic
of
switzerland
offers
us
an
excellent
example
in
all
matters
connected
with
building
up
an
efficient
citizen
soldiery

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
people
of
this
country
continue
to
enjoy
great
prosperity
undoubtedly
there
will
be
ebb
and
flow
in
such
prosperity
and
this
ebb
and
flow
will
be
felt
more
or
less
by
all
members
of
the
community
both
by
the
deserving
and
the
undeserving
against
the
wrath
of
the
lord
the
wisdom
of
man
cannot
avail
in
time
of
flood
or
drought
human
ingenuity
can
but
partially
repair
the
disaster
a
general
failure
of
crops
would
hurt
all
of
us
again
if
the
folly
of
man
mars
the
general
wellbeing
then
those
who
are
innocent
of
the
folly
will
have
to
pay
part
of
the
penalty
incurred
by
those
who
are
guilty
of
the
folly
a
panic
brought
on
by
the
speculative
folly
of
part
of
the
business
community
would
hurt
the
whole
business
community
but
such
stoppage
of
welfare
though
it
might
be
severe
would
not
be
lasting
in
the
long
run
the
one
vital
factor
in
the
permanent
prosperity
of
the
country
is
the
high
individual
character
of
the
average
american
worker
the
average
american
citizen
no
matter
whether
his
work
be
mental
or
manual
whether
he
be
farmer
or
wageworker
business
man
or
professional
man
in
our
industrial
and
social
system
the
interests
of
all
men
are
so
closely
intertwined
that
in
the
immense
majority
of
cases
a
straightdealing
man
who
by
his
efficiency
by
his
ingenuity
and
industry
benefits
himself
must
also
benefit
others
normally
the
man
of
great
productive
capacity
who
becomes
rich
by
guiding
the
labor
of
many
other
men
does
so
by
enabling
them
to
produce
more
than
they
could
produce
without
his
guidance
and
both
he
and
they
share
in
the
benefit
which
comes
also
to
the
public
at
large
the
superficial
fact
that
the
sharing
may
be
unequal
must
never
blind
us
to
the
underlying
fact
that
there
is
this
sharing
and
that
the
benefit
comes
in
some
degree
to
each
man
concerned
normally
the
wageworker
the
man
of
small
means
and
the
average
consumer
as
well
as
the
average
producer
are
all
alike
helped
by
making
conditions
such
that
the
man
of
exceptional
business
ability
receives
an
exceptional
reward
for
his
ability
something
can
be
done
by
legislation
to
help
the
general
prosperity
but
no
such
help
of
a
permanently
beneficial
character
can
be
given
to
the
less
able
and
less
fortunate
save
as
the
results
of
a
policy
which
shall
inure
to
the
advantage
of
all
industrious
and
efficient
people
who
act
decently
and
this
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
any
benefit
which
comes
to
the
less
able
and
less
fortunate
must
of
necessity
come
even
more
to
the
more
able
and
more
fortunate
if
therefore
the
less
fortunate
man
is
moved
by
envy
of
his
more
fortunate
brother
to
strike
at
the
conditions
under
which
they
have
both
though
unequally
prospered
the
result
will
assuredly
be
that
while
danger
may
come
to
the
one
struck
at
it
will
visit
with
an
even
heavier
load
the
one
who
strikes
the
blow
taken
as
a
whole
we
must
all
go
up
or
down
together
yet
while
not
merely
admitting
but
insisting
upon
this
it
is
also
true
that
where
there
is
no
governmental
restraint
or
supervision
some
of
the
exceptional
men
use
their
energies
not
in
ways
that
are
for
the
common
good
but
in
ways
which
tell
against
this
common
good
the
fortunes
amassed
through
corporate
organization
are
now
so
large
and
vest
such
power
in
those
that
wield
them
as
to
make
it
a
matter
of
necessity
to
give
to
the
sovereignthat
is
to
the
government
which
represents
the
people
as
a
wholesome
effective
power
of
supervision
over
their
corporate
use
in
order
to
insure
a
healthy
social
and
industrial
life
every
big
corporation
should
be
held
responsible
by
and
be
accountable
to
some
sovereign
strong
enough
to
control
its
conduct
i
am
in
no
sense
hostile
to
corporations
this
is
an
age
of
combination
and
any
effort
to
prevent
all
combination
will
be
not
only
useless
but
in
the
end
vicious
because
of
the
contempt
for
law
which
the
failure
to
enforce
law
inevitably
produces
we
should
moreover
recognize
in
cordial
and
ample
fashion
the
immense
good
effected
by
corporate
agencies
in
a
country
such
as
ours
and
the
wealth
of
intellect
energy
and
fidelity
devoted
to
their
service
and
therefore
normally
to
the
service
of
the
public
by
their
officers
and
directors
the
corporation
has
come
to
stay
just
as
the
trade
union
has
come
to
stay
each
can
do
and
has
done
great
good
each
should
be
favored
so
long
as
it
does
good
but
each
should
be
sharply
checked
where
it
acts
against
law
and
justice
so
long
as
the
finances
of
the
nation
are
kept
upon
an
honest
basis
no
other
question
of
internal
economy
with
which
the
congress
has
the
power
to
deal
begins
to
approach
in
importance
the
matter
of
endeavoring
to
secure
proper
industrial
conditions
under
which
the
individualsand
especially
the
great
corporationsdoing
an
interstate
business
are
to
act
the
makers
of
our
national
constitution
provided
especially
that
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
should
come
within
the
sphere
of
the
general
government
the
arguments
in
favor
of
their
taking
this
stand
were
even
then
overwhelming
but
they
are
far
stronger
today
in
view
of
the
enormous
development
of
great
business
agencies
usually
corporate
in
form
experience
has
shown
conclusively
that
it
is
useless
to
try
to
get
any
adequate
regulation
and
supervision
of
these
great
corporations
by
state
action
such
regulation
and
supervision
can
only
be
effectively
exercised
by
a
sovereign
whose
jurisdiction
is
coextensive
with
the
field
of
work
of
the
corporationsthat
is
by
the
national
government
i
believe
that
this
regulation
and
supervision
can
be
obtained
by
the
enactment
of
law
by
the
congress
if
this
proves
impossible
it
will
certainly
be
necessary
ultimately
to
confer
in
fullest
form
such
power
upon
the
national
government
by
a
proper
amendment
of
the
constitution
it
would
obviously
be
unwise
to
endeavor
to
secure
such
an
amendment
until
it
is
certain
that
the
result
cannot
be
obtained
under
the
constitution
as
it
now
is
the
laws
of
the
congress
and
of
the
several
states
hitherto
as
passed
upon
by
the
courts
have
resulted
more
often
in
showing
that
the
states
have
no
power
in
the
matter
than
that
the
national
government
has
power
so
that
there
at
present
exists
a
very
unfortunate
condition
of
things
under
which
these
great
corporations
doing
an
interstate
business
occupy
the
position
of
subjects
without
a
sovereign
neither
any
state
government
nor
the
national
government
having
effective
control
over
them
our
steady
aim
should
be
by
legislation
cautiously
and
carefully
undertaken
but
resolutely
persevered
in
to
assert
the
sovereignty
of
the
national
government
by
affirmative
action
this
is
only
in
form
an
innovation
in
substance
it
is
merely
a
restoration
for
from
the
earliest
time
such
regulation
of
industrial
activities
has
been
recognized
in
the
action
of
the
lawmaking
bodies
and
all
that
i
propose
is
to
meet
the
changed
conditions
in
such
manner
as
will
prevent
the
commonwealth
abdicating
the
power
it
has
always
possessed
not
only
in
this
country
but
also
in
england
before
and
since
this
country
became
a
separate
nation
it
has
been
a
misfortune
that
the
national
laws
on
this
subject
have
hitherto
been
of
a
negative
or
prohibitive
rather
than
an
affirmative
kind
and
still
more
that
they
have
in
part
sought
to
prohibit
what
could
not
be
effectively
prohibited
and
have
in
part
in
their
prohibitions
confounded
what
should
be
allowed
and
what
should
not
be
allowed
it
is
generally
useless
to
try
to
prohibit
all
restraint
on
competition
whether
this
restraint
be
reasonable
or
unreasonable
and
where
it
is
not
useless
it
is
generally
hurtful
events
have
shown
that
it
is
not
possible
adequately
to
secure
the
enforcement
of
any
law
of
this
kind
by
incessant
appeal
to
the
courts
the
department
of
justice
has
for
the
last
four
years
devoted
more
attention
to
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
legislation
than
to
anything
else
much
has
been
accomplished
particularly
marked
has
been
the
moral
effect
of
the
prosecutions
but
it
is
increasingly
evident
that
there
will
be
a
very
insufficient
beneficial
result
in
the
way
of
economic
change
the
successful
prosecution
of
one
device
to
evade
the
law
immediately
develops
another
device
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
what
is
needed
is
not
sweeping
prohibition
of
every
arrangement
good
or
bad
which
may
tend
to
restrict
competition
but
such
adequate
supervision
and
regulation
as
will
prevent
any
restriction
of
competition
from
being
to
the
detriment
of
the
publicas
well
as
such
supervision
and
regulation
as
will
prevent
other
abuses
in
no
way
connected
with
restriction
of
competition
of
these
abuses
perhaps
the
chief
although
by
no
means
the
only
one
is
overcapitalizationgenerally
itself
the
result
of
dishonest
promotionbecause
of
the
myriad
evils
it
brings
in
its
train
for
such
overcapitalization
often
means
an
inflation
that
invites
business
panic
it
always
conceals
the
true
relation
of
the
profit
earned
to
the
capital
actually
invested
and
it
creates
a
burden
of
interest
payments
which
is
a
fertile
cause
of
improper
reduction
in
or
limitation
of
wages
it
damages
the
small
investor
discourages
thrift
and
encourages
gambling
and
speculation
while
perhaps
worst
of
all
is
the
trickiness
and
dishonesty
which
it
impliesfor
harm
to
morals
is
worse
than
any
possible
harm
to
material
interests
and
the
debauchery
of
politics
and
business
by
great
dishonest
corporations
is
far
worse
than
any
actual
material
evil
they
do
the
public
until
the
national
government
obtains
in
some
manner
which
the
wisdom
of
the
congress
may
suggest
proper
control
over
the
big
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commercethat
is
over
the
great
majority
of
the
big
corporationsit
will
be
impossible
to
deal
adequately
with
these
evils
i
am
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
of
the
legislation
that
i
am
suggesting
and
of
the
need
of
temperate
and
cautious
action
in
securing
it
i
should
emphatically
protest
against
improperly
radical
or
hasty
action
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
deal
with
the
great
corporations
engaged
in
the
business
of
int
erstate
transportation
as
i
said
in
my
message
of
december
last
the
immediate
and
most
pressing
need
so
far
as
legislation
is
concerned
is
the
enactment
into
law
of
some
scheme
to
secure
to
the
agents
of
the
government
such
supervision
and
regulation
of
the
rates
charged
by
the
railroads
of
the
country
engaged
in
interstate
traffic
as
shall
summarily
and
effectively
prevent
the
imposition
of
unjust
or
unreasonable
rates
it
must
include
putting
a
complete
stop
to
rebates
in
every
shape
and
form
this
power
to
regulate
rates
like
all
similar
powers
over
the
business
world
should
be
exercised
with
moderation
caution
and
selfrestraint
but
it
should
exist
so
that
it
can
be
effectively
exercised
when
the
need
arises
the
first
consideration
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that
the
power
should
be
affirmative
and
should
be
given
to
some
administrative
body
created
by
the
congress
if
given
to
the
present
interstate
commerce
commission
or
to
a
reorganized
interstate
commerce
commission
such
commission
should
be
made
unequivocally
administrative
i
do
not
believe
in
the
government
interfering
with
private
business
more
than
is
necessary
i
do
not
believe
in
the
government
undertaking
any
work
which
can
with
propriety
be
left
in
private
hands
but
neither
do
i
believe
in
the
government
flinching
from
overseeing
any
work
when
it
becomes
evident
that
abuses
are
sure
to
obtain
therein
unless
there
is
governmental
supervision
it
is
not
my
province
to
indicate
the
exact
terms
of
the
law
which
should
be
enacted
but
i
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
certain
existing
conditions
with
which
it
is
desirable
to
deal
in
my
judgment
the
most
important
provision
which
such
law
should
contain
is
that
conferring
upon
some
competent
administrative
body
the
power
to
decide
upon
the
case
being
brought
before
it
whether
a
given
rate
prescribed
by
a
railroad
is
reasonable
and
just
and
if
it
is
found
to
be
unreasonable
and
unjust
then
after
full
investigation
of
the
complaint
to
prescribe
the
limit
of
rate
beyond
which
it
shall
not
be
lawful
to
gothe
maximum
reasonable
rate
as
it
is
commonly
calledthis
decision
to
go
into
effect
within
a
reasonable
time
and
to
obtain
from
thence
onward
subject
to
review
by
the
courts
it
sometimes
happens
at
present
not
that
a
rate
is
too
high
but
that
a
favored
shipper
is
given
too
low
a
rate
in
such
case
the
commission
would
have
the
right
to
fix
this
already
established
minimum
rate
as
the
maximum
and
it
would
need
only
one
or
two
such
decisions
by
the
commission
to
cure
railroad
companies
of
the
practice
of
giving
improper
minimum
rates
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
my
proposal
is
not
to
give
the
commission
power
to
initiate
or
originate
rates
generally
but
to
regulate
a
rate
already
fixed
or
originated
by
the
roads
upon
complaint
and
after
investigation
a
heavy
penalty
should
be
exacted
from
any
corporation
which
fails
to
respect
an
order
of
the
commission
i
regard
this
power
to
establish
a
maximum
rate
as
being
essential
to
any
scheme
of
real
reform
in
the
matter
of
railway
regulation
the
first
necessity
is
to
secure
it
and
unless
it
is
granted
to
the
commission
there
is
little
use
in
touching
the
subject
at
all
illegal
transactions
often
occur
under
the
forms
of
law
it
has
often
occurred
that
a
shipper
has
been
told
by
a
traffic
officer
to
buy
a
large
quantity
of
some
commodity
and
then
after
it
has
been
bought
an
open
reduction
is
made
in
the
rate
to
take
effect
immediately
the
arrangement
resulting
to
the
profit
of
one
shipper
and
the
one
railroad
and
to
the
damage
of
all
their
competitors
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
big
shippers
are
at
least
as
much
to
blame
as
any
railroad
in
the
matter
of
rebates
the
law
should
make
it
clear
so
that
nobody
can
fail
to
understand
that
any
kind
of
commission
paid
on
freight
shipments
whether
in
this
form
or
in
the
form
of
fictitious
damages
or
of
a
concession
a
free
pass
reduced
passenger
rate
or
payment
of
brokerage
is
illegal
it
is
worth
while
considering
whether
it
would
not
be
wise
to
confer
on
the
government
the
right
of
civil
action
against
the
beneficiary
of
a
rebate
for
at
least
twice
the
value
of
the
rebate
this
would
help
stop
what
is
really
blackmail
elevator
allowances
should
be
stopped
for
they
have
now
grown
to
such
an
extent
that
they
are
demoralizing
and
are
used
as
rebates
the
best
possible
regulation
of
rates
would
of
course
be
that
regulation
secured
by
an
honest
agreement
among
the
railroads
themselves
to
carry
out
the
law
such
a
general
agreement
would
for
instance
at
once
put
a
stop
to
the
efforts
of
any
one
big
shipper
or
big
railroad
to
discriminate
against
or
secure
advantages
over
some
rival
and
such
agreement
would
make
the
railroads
themselves
agents
for
enforcing
the
law
the
power
vested
in
the
government
to
put
a
stop
to
agreements
to
the
detriment
of
the
public
should
in
my
judgment
be
accompanied
by
power
to
permit
under
specified
conditions
and
careful
supervision
agreements
clearly
in
the
interest
of
the
public
but
in
my
judgment
the
necessity
for
giving
this
further
power
is
by
no
means
as
great
as
the
necessity
for
giving
the
commission
or
administrative
body
the
other
powers
i
have
enumerated
above
and
it
may
well
be
inadvisable
to
attempt
to
vest
this
particular
power
in
the
commission
or
other
administrative
body
until
it
already
possesses
and
is
exercising
what
i
regard
as
by
far
the
most
important
of
all
the
powers
i
recommendas
indeed
the
vitally
important
powerthat
to
fix
a
given
maximum
rate
which
rate
after
the
lapse
of
a
reasonable
time
goes
into
full
effect
subject
to
review
by
the
courts
all
privatecar
lines
industrial
roads
refrigerator
charges
and
the
like
should
be
expressly
put
under
the
supervision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
some
similar
body
so
far
as
rates
and
agreements
practically
affecting
rates
are
concerned
the
private
car
owners
and
the
owners
of
industrial
railroads
are
entitled
to
a
fair
and
reasonable
compensation
on
their
investment
but
neither
private
cars
nor
industrial
railroads
nor
spur
tracks
should
be
utilized
as
devices
for
securing
preferential
rates
a
rebate
in
icing
charges
or
in
mileage
or
in
a
division
of
the
rate
for
refrigerating
charges
is
just
as
pernicious
as
a
rebate
in
any
other
way
no
lower
rate
should
apply
on
goods
imported
than
actually
obtains
on
domestic
goods
from
the
american
seaboard
to
destination
except
in
cases
where
water
competition
is
the
controlling
influence
there
should
be
publicity
of
the
accounts
of
common
carriers
no
common
carrier
engaged
in
interstate
business
should
keep
any
books
or
memoranda
other
than
those
reported
pursuant
to
law
or
regulation
and
these
books
or
memoranda
should
be
open
to
the
inspection
of
the
government
only
in
this
way
can
violations
or
evasions
of
the
law
be
surely
detected
a
system
of
examination
of
railroad
accounts
should
be
provided
similar
to
that
now
conducted
into
the
national
banks
by
the
bank
examiners
a
few
firstclass
railroad
accountants
if
they
had
proper
direction
and
proper
authority
to
inspect
books
and
papers
could
accomplish
much
in
preventing
willful
violations
of
the
law
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
them
to
examine
into
the
accounts
of
any
railroad
unless
for
good
reasons
they
were
directed
to
do
so
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
it
is
greatly
to
be
desired
that
some
way
might
be
found
by
which
an
agreement
as
to
transportation
within
a
state
intended
to
operate
as
a
fraud
upon
the
federal
interstate
commerce
laws
could
be
brought
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
authorities
at
present
it
occurs
that
large
shipments
of
interstate
traffic
are
controlled
by
concessions
on
purely
state
business
which
of
course
amounts
to
an
evasion
of
the
law
the
commission
should
have
power
to
enforce
fair
treatment
by
the
great
trunk
lines
of
lateral
and
branch
lines
i
urge
upon
the
congress
the
need
of
providing
for
expeditious
action
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
all
these
matters
whether
in
regulating
rates
for
transportation
or
for
storing
or
for
handling
property
or
commodities
in
transit
the
history
of
the
cases
litigated
under
the
present
commerce
act
shows
that
its
efficacy
has
been
to
a
great
degree
destroyed
by
the
weapon
of
delay
almost
the
most
formidable
weapon
in
the
hands
of
those
whose
purpose
it
is
to
violate
the
law
let
me
most
earnestly
say
that
these
recommendations
are
not
made
in
any
spirit
of
hostility
to
the
railroads
on
ethical
grounds
on
grounds
of
right
such
hostility
would
be
intolerable
and
on
grounds
of
mere
national
selfinterest
we
must
remember
that
such
hostility
would
tell
against
the
welfare
not
merely
of
some
few
rich
men
but
of
a
multitude
of
small
investors
a
multitude
of
railway
employes
wage
workers
and
most
severely
against
the
interest
of
the
public
as
a
whole
i
believe
that
on
the
whole
our
railroads
have
done
well
and
not
ill
but
the
railroad
men
who
wish
to
do
well
should
not
be
exposed
to
competition
with
those
who
have
no
such
desire
and
the
only
way
to
secure
this
end
is
to
give
to
some
government
tribunal
the
power
to
see
that
justice
is
done
by
the
unwilling
exactly
as
it
is
gladly
done
by
the
willing
moreover
if
some
government
body
is
given
increased
power
the
effect
will
be
to
furnish
authoritative
answer
on
behalf
of
the
railroad
whenever
irrational
clamor
against
it
is
raised
or
whenever
charges
made
against
it
are
disproved
i
ask
this
legislation
not
only
in
the
interest
of
the
public
but
in
the
interest
of
the
honest
railroad
man
and
the
honest
shipper
alike
for
it
is
they
who
are
chiefly
jeoparded
by
the
practices
of
their
dishonest
competitors
this
legislation
should
be
enacted
in
a
spirit
as
remote
as
possible
from
hysteria
and
rancor
if
we
of
the
american
body
politic
are
true
to
the
traditions
we
have
inherited
we
shall
always
scorn
any
effort
to
make
us
hate
any
man
because
he
is
rich
just
as
much
as
we
should
scorn
any
effort
to
make
us
look
down
upon
or
treat
contemptuously
any
man
because
he
is
poor
we
judge
a
man
by
his

conductthat
is
by
his
characterand
not
by
his
wealth
or
intellect
if
he
makes
his
fortune
honestly
there
is
no
just
cause
of
quarrel
with
him
indeed
we
have
nothing
but
the
kindliest
feelings
of
admiration
for
the
successful
business
man
who
behaves
decently
whether
he
has
made
his
success
by
building
or
managing
a
railroad
or
by
shipping
goods
over
that
railroad
the
big
railroad
men
and
big
shippers
are
simply
americans
of
the
ordinary
type
who
have
developed
to
an
extraordinary
degree
certain
great
business
qualities
they
are
neither
better
nor
worse
than
their
fellowcitizens
of
smaller
means
they
are
merely
more
able
in
certain
lines
and
therefore
exposed
to
certain
peculiarly
strong
temptations
these
temptations
have
not
sprung
newly
into
being
the
exceptionally
successful
among
mankind
have
always
been
exposed
to
them
but
they
have
grown
amazingly
in
power
as
a
result
of
the
extraordinary
development
of
industrialism
along
new
lines
and
under
these
new
conditions
which
the
lawmakers
of
old
could
not
foresee
and
therefore
could
not
provide
against
they
have
become
so
serious
and
menacing
as
to
demand
entirely
new
remedies
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
best
type
of
railroad
man
and
the
best
type
of
shipper
no
less
than
of
the
public
that
there
should
be
governmental
supervision
and
regulation
of
these
great
business
operations
for
the
same
reason
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
corporation
which
wishes
to
treat
its
employes
aright
that
there
should
be
an
effective
employers
liability
act
or
an
effective
system
of
factory
laws
to
prevent
the
abuse
of
women
and
children
all
such
legislation
frees
the
corporation
that
wishes
to
do
well
from
being
driven
into
doing
ill
in
order
to
compete
with
its
rival
which
prefers
to
do
ill
we
desire
to
set
up
a
moral
standard
there
can
be
no
delusion
more
fatal
to
the
nation
than
the
delusion
that
the
standard
of
profits
of
business
prosperity
is
sufficient
in
judging
any
business
or
political
questionfrom
rate
legislation
to
municipal
government
business
success
whether
for
the
individual
or
for
the
nation
is
a
good
thing
only
so
far
as
it
is
accompanied
by
and
develops
a
high
standard
of
conducthonor
integrity
civic
courage
the
kind
of
business
prosperity
that
blunts
the
standard
of
honor
that
puts
an
inordinate
value
on
mere
wealth
that
makes
a
man
ruthless
and
conscienceless
in
trade
and
weak
and
cowardly
in
citizenship
is
not
a
good
thing
at
all
but
a
very
bad
thing
for
the
nation
this
government
stands
for
manhood
first
and
for
business
only
as
an
adjunct
of
manhood
the
question
of
transportation
lies
at
the
root
of
all
industrial
success
and
the
revolution
in
transportation
which
has
taken
place
during
the
last
half
century
has
been
the
most
important
factor
in
the
growth
of
the
new
industrial
conditions
most
emphatically
we
do
not
wish
to
see
the
man
of
great
talents
refused
the
reward
for
his
talents
still
less
do
we
wish
to
see
him
penalized
but
we
do
desire
to
see
the
system
of
railroad
transportation
so
handled
that
the
strong
man
shall
be
given
no
advantage
over
the
weak
man
we
wish
to
insure
as
fair
treatment
for
the
small
town
as
for
the
big
city
for
the
small
shipper
as
for
the
big
shipper
in
the
old
days
the
highway
of
commerce
whether
by
water
or
by
a
road
on
land
was
open
to
all
it
belonged
to
the
public
and
the
traffic
along
it
was
free
at
present
the
railway
is
this
highway
and
we
must
do
our
best
to
see
that
it
is
kept
open
to
all
on
equal
terms
unlike
the
old
highway
it
is
a
very
difficult
and
complex
thing
to
manage
and
it
is
far
better
that
it
should
be
managed
by
private
individuals
than
by
the
government
but
it
can
only
be
so
managed
on
condition
that
justice
is
done
the
public
it
is
because
in
my
judgment
public
ownership
of
railroads
is
highly
undesirable
and
would
probably
in
this
country
entail
farreaching
disaster
but
i
wish
to
see
such
supervision
and
regulation
of
them
in
the
interest
of
the
public
as
will
make
it
evident
that
there
is
no
need
for
public
ownership
the
opponents
of
government
regulation
dwell
upon
the
difficulties
to
be
encountered
and
the
intricate
and
involved
nature
of
the
problem
their
contention
is
true
it
is
a
complicated
and
delicate
problem
and
all
kinds
of
difficulties
are
sure
to
arise
in
connection
with
any
plan
of
solution
while
no
plan
will
bring
all
the
benefits
hoped
for
by
its
more
optimistic
adherents
moreover
under
any
healthy
plan
the
benefits
will
develop
gradually
and
not
rapidly
finally
we
must
clearly
understand
that
the
public
servants
who
are
to
do
this
peculiarly
responsible
and
delicate
work
must
themselves
be
of
the
highest
type
both
as
regards
integrity
and
efficiency
they
must
be
well
paid
for
otherwise
able
men
cannot
in
the
long
run
be
secured
and
they
must
possess
a
lofty
probity
which
will
revolt
as
quickly
at
the
thought
of
pandering
to
any
gust
of
popular
prejudice
against
rich
men
as
at
the
thought
of
anything
even
remotely
resembling
subserviency
to
rich
men
but
while
i
fully
admit
the
difficulties
in
the
way
i
do
not
for
a
moment
admit
that
these
difficulties
warrant
us
in
stopping
in
our
effort
to
secure
a
wise
and
just
system
they
should
have
no
other
effect
than
to
spur
us
on
to
the
exercise
of
the
resolution
the
evenhanded
justice
and
the
fertility
of
resource
which
we
like
to
think
of
as
typically
american
and
which
will
in
the
end
achieve
good
results
in
this
as
in
other
fields
of
activity
the
task
is
a
great
one
and
underlies
the
task
of
dealing
with
the
whole
industrial
problem
but
the
fact
that
it
is
a
great
problem
does
not
warrant
us
in
shrinking
from
the
attempt
to
solve
it
at
present
we
face
such
utter
lack
of
supervision
such
freedom
from
the
restraints
of
law
that
excellent
men
have
often
been
literally
forced
into
doing
what
they
deplored
because
otherwise
they
were
left
at
the
mercy
of
unscrupulous
competitors
to
rail
at
and
assail
the
men
who
have
done
as
they
best
could
under
such
conditions
accomplishes
little
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
develop
an
orderly
system
and
such
a
system
can
only
come
through
the
gradually
increased
exercise
of
the
right
of
efficient
government
control
in
my
annual
message
to
the
fiftyeighth
congress
at
its
third
session
i
called
attention
to
the
necessity
for
legislation
requiring
the
use
of
block
signals
upon
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
the
number
of
serious
collisions
upon
unblocked
roads
that
have
occurred
within
the
past
year
adds
force
to
the
recommendation
then
made
the
congress
should
provide
by
appropriate
legislation
for
the
introduction
of
block
signals
upon
all
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
at
the
earliest
practicable
date
as
a
measure
of
increased
safety
to
the
traveling
public
through
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
the
lower
federal
courts
in
cases
brought
before
them
for
adjudication
the
safety
appliance
law
has
been
materially
strengthened
and
the
government
has
been
enabled
to
secure
its
effective
enforcement
in
almost
all
cases
with
the
result
that
the
condition
of
railroad
equipment
throughout
the
country
is
much
improved
and
railroad
employes
perform
their
duties
under
safer
conditions
than
heretofore
the
governments
most
effective
aid
in
arriving
at
this
result
has
been
its
inspection
service
and
that
these
improved
conditions
are
not
more
general
is
due
to
the
insufficient
number
of
inspectors
employed
the
inspection
service
has
fully
demonstrated
its
usefulness
and
in
appropriating
for
its
maintenance
the
congress
should
make
provision
for
an
increase
in
the
number
of
inspectors
the
excessive
hours
of
labor
to
which
railroad
employes
in
train
service
are
in
many
cases
subjected
is
also
a
matter
which
may
well
engage
the
serious
attention
of
the
congress
the
strain
both
mental
and
physical
upon
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
movement
and
operation
of
railroad
trains
under
modern
conditions
is
perhaps
greater
than
that
which
exists
in
any
other
industry
and
if
there
are
any
reasons
for
limiting
by
law
the
hours
of
labor
in
any
employment
they
certainly
apply
with
peculiar
force
to
the
employment
of
those
upon
whose
vigilance
and
alertness
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
the
safety
of
all
who
travel
by
rail
depends
in
my
annual
message
to
the
fiftyseventh
congress
at
its
second
session
i
recommended
the
passage
of
an
employers
liability
law
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
our
navy
yards
i
renewed
that
recommendation
in
my
message
to
the
fiftyeighth
congress
at
its
second
session
and
further
suggested
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
make
a
comprehensive
study
of
employers
liability
with
a
view
to
the
enactment
of
a
wise
and
constitutional
law
covering
the
subject
applicable
to
all
industries
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
power
i
hope
that
such
a
law
will
be
prepared
and
enacted
as
speedily
as
possible
the
national
government
has
as
a
rule
but
little
occasion
to
deal
with
the
formidable
group
of
problems
connected
more
or
less
directly
with
what
is
known
as
the
labor
question
for
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
these
problems
must
be
dealt
with
by
the
state
and
municipal
authorities
and
not
by
the
national
government
the
national
government
has
control
of
the
district
of
columbia
however
and
it
should
see
to
it
that
the
city
of
washington
is
made
a
model
city
in
all
respects
both
as
regards
parks
public
playgrounds
proper
regulation
of
the
system
of
housing
so
as
to
do
away
with
the
evils
of
alley
tenements
a
proper
system
of
education
a
proper
system
of
dealing
with
truancy
and
juvenile
offenders
a
proper
handling
of
the
charitable
work
of
the
district
moreover
there
should
be
proper
factory
laws
to
prevent
all
abuses
in
the
employment
of
women
and
children
in
the
district
these
will
be
useful
chiefly
as
object
lessons
but
even
this
limited
amount
of
usefulness
would
be
of
real
national
value
there
has
been
demand
for
depriving
courts
of
the
power
to
issue
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
such
special
limitation
of
the
equity
powers
of
our
courts
would
be
most
unwise

it
is
true
that
some
judges
have
misused
this
power
but
this
does
not
justify
a
denial
of
the
power
any
more
than
an
improper
exercise
of
the
power
to
call
a
strike
by
a
labor
leader
would
justify
the
denial
of
the
right
to
strike
the
remedy
is
to
regulate
the
procedure
by
requiring
the
judge
to
give
due
notice
to
the
adverse
parties
before
granting
the
writ
the
hearing
to
be
ex
parte
if
the
adverse
party
does
not
appear
at
the
time
and
place
ordered
what
is
due
notice
must
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
case
it
should
not
be
used
as
a
pretext
to
permit
violation
of
law
or
the
jeopardizing
of
life
or
property
of
course
this
would
not
authorize
the
issuing
of
a
restraining
order
or
injunction
in
any
case
in
which
it
is
not
already
authorized
by
existing
law
i
renew
the
recommendation
i
made
in
my
last
annual
message
for
an
investigation
by
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
of
general
labor
conditions
especial
attention
to
be
paid
to
the
conditions
of
child
labor
and
childlabor
legislation
in
the
several
states
such
an
investigation
should
take
into
account
the
various
problems
with
which
the
question
of
child
labor
is
connected
it
is
true
that
these
problems
can
be
actually
met
in
most
cases
only
by
the
states
themselves
but
it
would
be
well
for
the
nation
to
endeavor
to
secure
and
publish
comprehensive
information
as
to
the
conditions
of
the
labor
of
children
in
the
different
states
so
as
to
spur
up
those
that
are
behindhand
and
to
secure
approximately
uniform
legislation
of
a
high
character
among
the
several
states
in
such
a
republic
as
ours
the
one
thing
that
we
cannot
afford
to
neglect
is
the
problem
of
turning
out
decent
citizens
the
future
of
the
nation
depends
upon
the
citizenship
of
the
generations
to
come
the
children
of
today
are
those
who
tomorrow
will
shape
the
destiny
of
our
land
and
we
cannot
afford
to
neglect
them
the
legislature
of
colorado
has
recommended
that
the
national
government
provide
some
general
measure
for
the
protection
from
abuse
of
children
and
dumb
animals
throughout
the
united
states
i
lay
the
matter
before
you
for
what
i
trust
will
be
your
favorable
consideration
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
should
also
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
conditions
of
women
in
industry
over
five
million
american
women
are
now
engaged
in
gainful
occupations
yet
there
is
an
almost
complete
dearth
of
data
upon
which
to
base
any
trustworthy
conclusions
as
regards
a
subject
as
important
as
it
is
vast
and
complicated
there
is
need
of
full
knowledge
on
which
to
base
action
looking
toward
state
and
municipal
legislation
for
the
protection
of
working
women
the
introduction
of
women
into
industry
is
working
change
and
disturbance
in
the
domestic
and
social
life
of
the
nation
the
decrease
in
marriage
and
especially
in
the
birth
rate
has
been
coincident
with
it
we
must
face
accomplished
facts
and
the
adjustment
of
factory
conditions
must
be
made
but
surely
it
can
be
made
with
less
friction
and
less
harmful
effects
on
family
life
than
is
now
the
case
this
whole
matter
in
reality
forms
one
of
the
greatest
sociological
phenomena
of
our
time
it
is
a
social
question
of
the
first
importance
of
far
greater
importance
than
any
merely
political
or
economic
question
can
be
and
to
solve
it
we
need
ample
data
gathered
in
a
sane
and
scientific
spirit
in
the
course
of
an
exhaustive
investigation
in
any
great
labor
disturbance
not
only
are
employer
and
employe
interested
but
a
third
partythe
general
public
every
considerable
labor
difficulty
in
which
interstate
commerce
is
involved
should
be
investigated
by
the
government
and
the
facts
officially
reported
to
the
public
the
question
of
securing
a
healthy
selfrespecting
and
mutually
sympathetic
attitude
as
between
employer
and
employe
capitalist
and
wageworker
is
a
difficult
one
all
phases
of
the
labor
problem
prove
difficult
when
approached
but
the
underlying
principles
the
root
principles
in
accordance
with
which
the
problem
must
be
solved
are
entirely
simple
we
can
get
justice
and
right
dealing
only
if
we
put
as
of
paramount
importance
the
principle
of
treating
a
man
on
his
worth
as
a
man
rather
than
with
reference
to
his
social
position
his
occupation
or
the
class
to
which
he
belongs
there
are
selfish
and
brutal
men
in
all
ranks
of
life
if
they
are
capitalists
their
selfishness
and
brutality
may
take
the
form
of
hard
indifference
to
suffering
greedy
disregard
of
every
moral
restraint
which
interferes
with
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
coldblooded
exploitation
of
the
weak
or
if
they
are
laborers
the
form
of
laziness
of
sullen
envy
of
the
more
fortunate
and
of
willingness
to
perform
deeds
of
murderous
violence
such
conduct
is
just
as
reprehensible
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
and
all
honest
and
farseeing
men
should
join
in
warring
against
it
wherever
it
becomes
manifest
individual
capitalist
and
individual
wageworker
corporation
and
union
are
alike
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
law
and
must
alike
obey
the
law
moreover
in
addition
to
mere
obedience
to
the
law
each
man
if
he
be
really
a
good
citizen
must
show
broad
sympathy
for
his
neighbor
and
genuine
desire
to
look
at
any
question
arising
between
them
from
the
standpoint
of
that
neighbor
no
less
than
from
his
own
and
to
this
end
it
is
essential
that
capitalist
and
wageworker
should
consult
freely
one
with
the
other
should
each
strive
to
bring
closer
the
day
when
both
shall
realize
that
they
are
properly
partners
and
not
enemies
to
approach
the
questions
which
inevitably
arise
between
them
solely
from
the
standpoint
which
treats
each
side
in
the
mass
as
the
enemy
of
the
other
side
in
the
mass
is
both
wicked
and
foolish
in
the
past
the
most
direful
among
the
influences
which
have
brought
about
the
downfall
of
republics
has
ever
been
the
growth
of
the
class
spirit
the
growth
of
the
spirit
which
tends
to
make
a
man
subordinate
the
welfare
of
the
public
as
a
whole
to
the
welfare
of
the
particular
class
to
which
he
belongs
the
substitution
of
loyalty
to
a
class
for
loyalty
to
the
nation
this
inevitably
brings
about
a
tendency
to
treat
each
man
not
on
his
merits
as
an
individual
but
on
his
position
as
belonging
to
a
certain
class
in
the
community
if
such
a
spirit
grows
up
in
this
republic
it
will
ultimately
prove
fatal
to
us
as
in
the
past
it
has
proved
fatal
to
every
community
in
which
it
has
become
dominant
unless
we
continue
to
keep
a
quick
and
lively
sense
of
the
great
fundamental
truth
that
our
concern
is
with
the
individual
worth
of
the
individual
man
this
government
cannot
permanently
hold
the
place
which
it
has
achieved
among
the
nations
the
vital
lines
of
cleavage
among
our
people
do
not
correspond
and
indeed
run
at
right
angles
to
the
lines
of
cleavage
which
divide
occupation
from
occupation
which
divide
wageworkers
from
capitalists
farmers
from
bankers
men
of
small
means
from
men
of
large
means
men
who
live
in
the
towns
from
men
who
live
in
the
country
for
the
vital
line
of
cleavage
is
the
line
which
divides
the
honest
man
who
tries
to
do
well
by
his
neighbor
from
the
dishonest
man
who
does
ill
by
his
neighbor
in
other
words
the
standard
we
should
establish
is
the
standard
of
conduct
not
the
standard
of
occupation
of
means
or
of
social
position
it
is
the
mans
moral
quality
his
attitude
toward
the
great
questions
which
concern
all
humanity
his
cleanliness
of
life
his
power
to
do
his
duty
toward
himself
and
toward
others
which
really
count
and
if
we
substitute
for
the
standard
of
personal
judgment
which
treats
each
man
according
to
his
merits
another
standard
in
accordance
with
which
all
men
of
one
class
are
favored
and
all
men
of
another
class
discriminated
against
we
shall
do
irreparable
damage
to
the
body
politic
i
believe
that
our
people
are
too
sane
too
selfrespecting
too
fit
for
selfgovernment
ever
to
adopt
such
an
attitude
this
government
is
not
and
never
shall
be
government
by
a
plutocracy
this
government
is
not
and
never
shall
be
government
by
a
mob
it
shall
continue
to
be
in
the
future
what
it
has
been
in
the
past
a
government
based
on
the
theory
that
each
man
rich
or
poor
is
to
be
treated
simply
and
solely
on
his
worth
as
a
man
that
all
his
personal
and
property
rights
are
to
be
safeguarded
and
that
he
is
neither
to
wrong
others
nor
to
suffer
wrong
from
others
the
noblest
of
all
forms
of
government
is
selfgovernment
but
it
is
also
the
most
difficult
we
who
possess
this
priceless
boon
and
who
desire
to
hand
it
on
to
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
should
ever
bear
in
mind
the
thought
so
finely
expressed
by
burke
men
are
qualified
for
civil
liberty
in
exact
proportion
to
their
disposition
to
put
moral
chains
upon
their
own
appetites
in
proportion
as
they
are
disposed
to
listen
to
the
counsels
of
the
wise
and
good
in
preference
to
the
flattery
of
knaves
society
cannot
exist
unless
a
controlling
power
upon
will
and
appetite
be
placed
somewhere
and
the
less
of
it
there
be
within
the
more
there
must
be
without
it
is
ordained
in
the
eternal
constitution
of
things
that
men
of
intemperate
minds
cannot
be
free
their
passions
forge
their
fetters
the
great
insurance
companies
afford
striking
examples
of
corporations
whose
business
has
extended
so
far
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
which
created
them
as
to
preclude
strict
enforcement
of
supervision
and
regulation
by
the
parent
states
in
my
last
annual
message
i
recommended
that
the
congress
carefully
consider
whether
the
power
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
cannot
constitutionally
be
extended
to
cover
interstate
transactions
in
insurance
recent
events
have
emphasized
the
importance
of
an
early
and
exhaustive
consideration
of
this
question
to
see
whether
it
is
not
possible
to
furnish
better
safeguards
than
the
several
states
have
been
able
to
furnish
against
corruption
of
the
flagrant
kind
which
has
been
exposed
it
has
been
only
too
clearly
shown
that
certain
of
the
men
at
the
head
of
these
large
corporations
take
but
small
note
of
the
ethical
distinction
between
honesty
and
dishonesty
they
draw
the
line
only
this
side
of
what
may
be
called
l
awhonesty
the
kind
of
honesty
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
falling
into
the
clutches
of
the
law
of
course
the
only
complete
remedy
for
this
condition
must
be
found
in
an
aroused
public
conscience
a
higher
sense
of
ethical
conduct
in
the
community
at
large
and
especially
among
business
men
and
in
the
great
profession
of
the
law
and
in
the
growth
of
a
spirit
which
condemns
all
dishonesty
whether
in
rich
man
or
in
poor
man
whether
it
takes
the
shape
of
bribery
or
of
blackmail
but
much
can
be
done
by
legislation
which
is
not
only
drastic
but
practical
there
is
need
of
a
far
stricter
and
more
uniform
regulation
of
the
vast
insurance
interests
of
this
country
the
united
states
should
in
this
respect
follow
the
policy
of
other
nations
by
providing
adequate
national
supervision
of
commercial
interests
which
are
clearly
national
in
character
my
predecessors
have
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
foreign
business
of
these
companies
is
an
important
part
of
our
foreign
commercial
relations
during
the
administrations
of
presidents
cleveland
harrison
and
mckinley
the
state
department
exercised
its
influence
through
diplomatic
channels
to
prevent
unjust
discrimination
by
foreign
countries
against
american
insurance
companies
these
negotiations
illustrated
the
propriety
of
the
congress
recognizing
the
national
character
of
insurance
for
in
the
absence
of
federal
legislation
the
state
department
could
only
give
expression
to
the
wishes
of
the
authorities
of
the
several
states
whose
policy
was
ineffective
through
want
of
uniformity
i
repeat
my
previous
recommendation
that
the
congress
should
also
consider
whether
the
federal
government
has
any
power
or
owes
any
duty
with
respect
to
domestic
transactions
in
insurance
of
an
interstate
character
that
state
supervision
has
proved
inadequate
is
generally
conceded
the
burden
upon
insurance
companies
and
therefore
their
policy
holders
of
conflicting
regulations
of
many
states
is
unquestioned
while
but
little
effective
check
is
imposed
upon
any
able
and
unscrupulous
man
who
desires
to
exploit
the
company
in
his
own
interest
at
the
expense
of
the
policy
holders
and
of
the
public
the
inability
of
a
state
to
regulate
effectively
insurance
corporations
created
under
the
laws
of
other
states
and
transacting
the
larger
part
of
their
business
elsewhere
is
also
clear
as
a
remedy
for
this
evil
of
conflicting
ineffective
and
yet
burdensome
regulations
there
has
been
for
many
years
a
widespread
demand
for
federal
supervision
the
congress
has
already
recognized
that
interstate
insurance
may
be
a
proper
subject
for
federal
legislation
for
in
creating
the
bureau
of
corporations
it
authorized
it
to
publish
and
supply
useful
information
concerning
interstate
corporations
including
corporations
engaged
in
insurance
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
compilation
of
statistics
be
the
limit
of
the
federal
power
it
is
wholly
ineffective
to
regulate
this
form
of
commercial
intercourse
between
the
states
and
as
the
insurance
business
has
outgrown
in
magnitude
the
possibility
of
adequate
state
supervision
the
congress
should
carefully
consider
whether
further
legislation
can
be
bad
what
is
said
above
applies
with
equal
force
to
fraternal
and
benevolent
organizations
which
contract
for
life
insurance
there
is
more
need
of
stability
than
of
the
attempt
to
attain
an
ideal
perfection
in
the
methods
of
raising
revenue
and
the
shock
and
strain
to
the
business
world
certain
to
attend
any
serious
change
in
these
methods
render
such
change
inadvisable
unless
for
grave
reason
it
is
not
possible
to
lay
down
any
general
rule
by
which
to
determine
the
moment
when
the
reasons
for
will
outweigh
the
reasons
against
such
a
change
much
must
depend
not
merely
on
the
needs
but
on
the
desires
of
the
people
as
a
whole
for
needs
and
desires
are
not
necessarily
identical
of
course
no
change
can
be
made
on
lines
beneficial
to
or
desired
by
one
section
or
one
state
only
there
must
be
something
like
a
general
agreement
among
the
citizens
of
the
several
states
as
represented
in
the
congress
that
the
change
is
needed
and
desired
in
the
interest
of
the
people
as
a
whole
and
there
should
then
be
a
sincere
intelligent
and
disinterested
effort
to
make
it
in
such
shape
as
will
combine
so
far
as
possible
the
maximum
of
good
to
the
people
at
large
with
the
minimum
of
necessary
disregard
for
the
special
interests
of
localities
or
classes
but
in
time
of
peace
the
revenue
must
on
the
average
taking
a
series
of
years
together
equal
the
expenditures
or
else
the
revenues
must
be
increased
last
year
there
was
a
deficit
unless
our
expenditures
can
be
kept
within
the
revenues
then
our
revenue
laws
must
be
readjusted
it
is
as
yet
too
early
to
attempt
to
outline
what
shape
such
a
readjustment
should
take
for
it
is
as
yet
too
early
to
say
whether
there
will
be
need
for
it
it
should
be
considered
whether
it
is
not
desirable
that
the
tariff
laws
should
provide
for
applying
as
against
or
in
favor
of
any
other
nation
maximum
and
minimum
tariff
rates
established
by
the
congress
so
as
to
secure
a
certain
reciprocity
of
treatment
between
other
nations
and
ourselves
having
in
view
even
larger
considerations
of
policy
than
those
of
a
purely
economic
nature
it
would
in
my
judgment
be
well
to
endeavor
to
bring
about
closer
commercial
connections
with
the
other
peoples
of
this
continent
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
announce
to
you
that
russia
now
treats
us
on
the
mostfavorednation
basis
i
earnestly
recommend
to
congress
the
need
of
economy
and
to
this
end
of
a
rigid
scrutiny
of
appropriations
as
examples
merely
i
call
your
attention
to
one
or
two
specific
matters
all
unnecessary
offices
should
be
abolished
the
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
recommends
the
abolishment
of
the
office
of
receiver
of
public
moneys
for
the
united
states
land
office
this
will
effect
a
saving
of
about
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
as
the
business
of
the
nation
grows
it
is
inevitable
that
there
should
be
from
time
to
time
a
legitimate
increase
in
the
number
of
officials
and
this
fact
renders
it
all
the
more
important
that
when
offices
become
unnecessary
they
should
be
abolished
in
the
public
printing
also
a
large
saving
of
public
money
can
be
made
there
is
a
constantly
growing
tendency
to
publish
masses
of
unimportant
information
it
is
probably
not
unfair
to
say
that
many
tens
of
thousands
of
volumes
are
published
at
which
no
human
being
ever
looks
and
for
which
there
is
no
real
demand
whatever
yet
in
speaking
of
economy
i
must
in
no
wise
be
understood
as
advocating
the
false
economy
which
is
in
the
end
the
worst
extravagance
to
cut
down
on
the
navy
for
instance
would
be
a
crime
against
the
nation
to
fail
to
push
forward
all
work
on
the
panama
canal
would
be
as
great
a
folly
in
my
message
of
december
to
the
congress
i
said
interest
rates
are
a
potent
factor
in
business
activity
and
in
order
that
these
rates
may
be
equalized
to
meet
the
varying
needs
of
the
seasons
and
of
widely
separated
communities
and
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
financial
stringencies
which
injuriously
affect
legitimate
business
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
an
element
of
elasticity
in
our
monetary
system
banks
are
the
natural
servants
of
commerce
and
upon
them
should
be
placed
as
far
as
practicable
the
burden
of
furnishing
and
maintaining
a
circulation
adequate
to
supply
the
needs
of
our
diversified
industries
and
of
our
domestic
and
foreign
commerce
and
the
issue
of
this
should
be
so
regulated
that
a
sufficient
supply
should
be
always
available
for
the
business
interests
of
the
country
every
consideration
of
prudence
demands
the
addition
of
the
element
of
elasticity
to
our
currency
system
the
evil
does
not
consist
in
an
inadequate
volume
of
money
but
in
the
rigidity
of
this
volume
which
does
not
respond
as
it
should
to
the
varying
needs
of
communities
and
of
seasons
inflation
must
be
avoided
but
some
provision
should
be
made
that
will
insure
a
larger
volume
of
money
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
than
in
the
less
active
seasons
of
the
year
so
that
the
currency
will
contract
against
speculation
and
will
expand
for
the
needs
of
legitimate
business
at
present
the
treasury
department
is
at
irregularly
recurring
intervals
obliged
in
the
interest
of
the
business
worldthat
is
in
the
interests
of
the
american
publicto
try
to
avert
financial
crises
by
providing
a
remedy
which
should
be
provided
by
congressional
action
at
various
times
i
have
instituted
investigations
into
the
organization
and
conduct
of
the
business
of
the
executive
departments
while
none
of
these
inquiries
have
yet
progressed
far
enough
to
warrant
final
conclusions
they
have
already
confirmed
and
emphasized
the
general
impression
that
the
organization
of
the
departments
is
often
faulty
in
principle
and
wasteful
in
results
while
many
of
their
business
methods
are
antiquated
and
inefficient
there
is
every
reason
why
our
executive
governmental
machinery
should
be
at
least
as
well
planned
economical
and
efficient
as
the
best
machinery
of
the
great
business
organizations
which
at
present
is
not
the
case
to
make
it
so
is
a
task
of
complex
detail
and
essentially
executive
in
its
nature
probably
no
legislative
body
no
matter
how
wise
and
able
could
undertake
it
with
reasonable
prospect
of
success
i
recommend
that
the
congress
consider
this
subject
with
a
view
to
provide
by
legislation
for
the
transfer
distribution
consolidation
and
assignment
of
duties
and
executive
organizations
or
parts
of
organizations
and
for
the
changes
in
business
methods
within
or
between
the
several
departments
that
will
best
promote
the
economy
efficiency
and
high
character
of
the
government
work
in
my
last
annual
message
i
said
the
power
of
the
government
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
elections
of
its
own
officials
is
inherent
and
has
been
recognized
and
affirmed
by
repeated
declarations
of
the
supreme
court
there
is
no
enemy
of
free
government
more
dangerous
and
none
so
insidious
as
the
corruption
of
the
electorate
no
one
defends
or
excuses
corruption
and
it
would
seem
to
follow

that
none
would
oppose
vigorous
measures
to
eradicate
it
i
recommend
the
enactment
of
a
law
directed
against
bribery
and
corruption
in
federal
elections
the
details
of
such
a
law
may
be
safely
left
to
the
wise
discretion
of
the
congress
but
it
should
go
as
far
as
under
the
constitution
it
is
possible
to
go
and
should
include
severe
penalties
against
him
who
gives
or
receives
a
bribe
intended
to
influence
his
act
or
opinion
as
an
elector
and
provisions
for
the
publication
not
only
of
the
expenditures
for
nominations
and
elections
of
all
candidates
but
also
of
all
contributions
received
and
expenditures
made
by
political
committees
i
desire
to
repeat
this
recommendation
in
political
campaigns
in
a
country
as
large
and
populous
as
ours
it
is
inevitable
that
there
should
be
much
expense
of
an
entirely
legitimate
kind
this
of
course
means
that
many
contributions
and
some
of
them
of
large
size
must
be
made
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
any
big
political
contest
such
contributions
are
always
made
to
both
sides
it
is
entirely
proper
both
to
give
and
receive
them
unless
there
is
an
improper
motive
connected
with
either
gift
or
reception
if
they
are
extorted
by
any
kind
of
pressure
or
promise
express
or
implied
direct
or
indirect
in
the
way
of
favor
or
immunity
then
the
giving
or
receiving
becomes
not
only
improper
but
criminal
it
will
undoubtedly
be
difficult
as
a
matter
of
practical
detail
to
shape
an
act
which
shall
guard
with
reasonable
certainty
against
such
misconduct
but
if
it
is
possible
to
secure
by
law
the
full
and
verified
publication
in
detail
of
all
the
sums
contributed
to
and
expended
by
the
candidates
or
committees
of
any
political
parties
the
result
cannot
but
be
wholesome
all
contributions
by
corporations
to
any
political
committee
or
for
any
political
purpose
should
be
forbidden
by
law
directors
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
stockholders
money
for
such
purposes
and
moreover
a
prohibition
of
this
kind
would
be
as
far
as
it
went
an
effective
method
of
stopping
the
evils
aimed
at
in
corrupt
practices
acts
not
only
should
both
the
national
and
the
several
state
legislatures
forbid
any
officer
of
a
corporation
from
using
the
money
of
the
corporation
in
or
about
any
election
but
they
should
also
forbid
such
use
of
money
in
connection
with
any
legislation
save
by
the
employment
of
counsel
in
public
manner
for
distinctly
legal
services
the
first
conference
of
nations
held
at
the
hague
in
being
unable
to
dispose
of
all
the
business
before
it
recommended
the
consideration
and
settlement
of
a
number
of
important
questions
by
another
conference
to
be
called
subsequently
and
at
an
early
date
these
questions
were
the
following
the
rights
and
duties
of
neutrals
the
limitation
of
the
armed
forces
on
land
and
sea
and
of
military
budgets
the
use
of
new
types
and
calibres
of
military
and
naval
guns
the
inviolability
of
private
property
at
sea
in
times
of
war
the
bombardment
of
ports
cities
and
villages
by
naval
forces
in
october
at
the
instance
of
the
interparliamentary
union
which
at
a
conference
held
in
the
united
states
and
attended
by
the
lawmakers
of
fifteen
different
nations
had
reiterated
the
demand
for
a
second
conference
of
nations
i
issued
invitations
to
all
the
powers
signatory
to
the
hague
convention
to
send
delegates
to
such
a
conference
and
suggested
that
it
be
again
held
at
the
hague
in
its
note
of
december
the
united
states
government
communicated
to
the
representatives
of
foreign
governments
its
belief
that
the
conference
could
be
best
arranged
under
the
provisions
of
the
present
hague
treaty
from
all
the
powers
acceptance
was
received
coupled
in
some
cases
with
the
condition
that
we
should
wait
until
the
end
of
the
war
then
waging
between
russia
and
japan
the
emperor
of
russia
immediately
after
the
treaty
of
peace
which
so
happily
terminated
this
war
in
a
note
presented
to
the
president
on
september
through
ambassador
rosen
took
the
initiative
in
recommending
that
the
conference
be
now
called
the
united
states
government
in
response
expressed
its
cordial
acquiescence
and
stated
that
it
would
as
a
matter
of
course
take
part
in
the
new
conference
and
endeavor
to
further
its
aims
we
assume
that
all
civilized
governments
will
support
the
movement
and
that
the
conference
is
now
an
assured
fact
this
government
will
do
everything
in
its
power
to
secure
the
success
of
the
conference
to
the
end
that
substantial
progress
may
be
made
in
the
cause
of
international
peace
justice
and
good
will
this
renders
it
proper
at
this
time
to
say
something
as
to
the
general
attitude
of
this
government
toward
peace
more
and
more
war
is
coming
to
be
looked
upon
as
in
itself
a
lamentable
and
evil
thing
a
wanton
or
useless
war
or
a
war
of
mere
aggressionin
short
any
war
begun
or
carried
on
in
a
conscienceless
spirit
is
to
be
condemned
as
a
peculiarly
atrocious
crime
against
all
humanity
we
can
however
do
nothing
of
permanent
value
for
peace
unless
we
keep
ever
clearly
in
mind
the
ethical
element
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
problem
our
aim
is
righteousness
peace
is
normally
the
handmaiden
of
rightousness
but
when
peace
and
righteousness
conflict
then
a
great
and
upright
people
can
never
for
a
moment
hesitate
to
follow
the
path
which
leads
toward
righteousness
even
though
that
path
also
leads
to
war
there
are
persons
who
advocate
peace
at
any
price
there
are
others
who
following
a
false
analogy
think
that
because
it
is
no
longer
necessary
in
civilized
countries
for
individuals
to
protect
their
rights
with
a
strong
hand
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
for
nations
to
be
ready
to
defend
their
rights
these
persons
would
do
irreparable
harm
to
any
nation
that
adopted
their
principles
and
even
as
it
is
they
seriously
hamper
the
cause
which
they
advocate
by
tending
to
render
it
absurd
in
the
eyes
of
sensible
and
patriotic
men
there
can
be
no
worse
foe
of
mankind
in
general
and
of
his
own
country
in
particular
than
the
demagogue
of
war
the
man
who
in
mere
folly
or
to
serve
his
own
selfish
ends
continually
rails
at
and
abuses
other
nations
who
seeks
to
excite
his
countrymen
against
foreigners
on
insufficient
pretexts
who
excites
and
inflames
a
perverse
and
aggressive
national
vanity
and
who
may
on
occasions
wantonly
bring
on
conflict
between
his
nation
and
some
other
nation
but
there
are
demagogues
of
peace
just
as
there
are
demagogues
of
war
and
in
any
such
movement
as
this
for
the
hague
conference
it
is
essential
not
to
be
misled
by
one
set
of
extremists
any
more
than
by
the
other
whenever
it
is
possible
for
a
nation
or
an
individual
to
work
for
real
peace
assuredly
it
is
failure
of
duty
not
so
to
strive
but
if
war
is
necessary
and
righteous
then
either
the
man
or
the
nation
shrinking
from
it
forfeits
all
title
to
selfrespect
we
have
scant
sympathy
with
the
sentimentalist
who
dreads
oppression
less
than
physical
suffering
who
would
prefer
a
shameful
peace
to
the
pain
and
toil
sometimes
lamentably
necessary
in
order
to
secure
a
righteous
peace
as
yet
there
is
only
a
partial
and
imperfect
analogy
between
international
law
and
internal
or
municipal
law
because
there
is
no
sanction
of
force
for
executing
the
former
while
there
is
in
the
case
of
the
latter
the
private
citizen
is
protected
in
his
rights
by
the
law
because
the
law
rests
in
the
last
resort
upon
force
exercised
through
the
forms
of
law
a
man
does
not
have
to
defend
his
rights
with
his
own
hand
because
he
can
call
upon
the
police
upon
the
sheriffs
posse
upon
the
militia
or
in
certain
extreme
cases
upon
the
army
to
defend
him
but
there
is
no
such
sanction
of
force
for
international
law
at
present
there
could
be
no
greater
calamity
than
for
the
free
peoples
the
enlightened
independent
and
peaceloving
peoples
to
disarm
while
yet
leaving
it
open
to
any
barbarism
or
despotism
to
remain
armed
so
long
as
the
world
is
as
unorganized
as
now
the
armies
and
navies
of
those
peoples
who
on
the
whole
stand
for
justice
offer
not
only
the
best
but
the
only
possible
security
for
a
just
peace
for
instance
if
the
united
states
alone
or
in
company
only
with
the
other
nations
that
on
the
whole
tend
to
act
justly
disarmed
we
might
sometimes
avoid
bloodshed
but
we
would
cease
to
be
of
weight
in
securing
the
peace
of
justicethe
real
peace
for
which
the
most
lawabiding
and
highminded
men
must
at
times
be
willing
to
fight
as
the
world
is
now
only
that
nation
is
equipped
for
peace
that
knows
how
to
fight
and
that
will
not
shrink
from
fighting
if
ever
the
conditions
become
such
that
war
is
demanded
in
the
name
of
the
highest
morality
so
much
it
is
emphatically
necessary
to
say
in
order
both
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
may
not
be
misunderstood
and
that
a
genuine
effort
to
bring
nearer
the
day
of
the
peace
of
justice
among
the
nations
may
not
be
hampered
by
a
folly
which
in
striving
to
achieve
the
impossible
would
render
it
hopeless
to
attempt
the
achievement
of
the
practical
but
while
recognizing
most
clearly
all
above
set
forth
it
remains
our
clear
duty
to
strive
in
every
practicable
way
to
bring
nearer
the
time
when
the
sword
shall
not
be
the
arbiter
among
nations
at
present
the
practical
thing
to
do
is
to
try
to
minimize
the
number
of
cases
in
which
it
must
be
the
arbiter
and
to
offer
at
least
to
all
civilized
powers
some
substitute
for
war
which
will
be
available
in
at
least
a
considerable
number
of
instances
very
much
can
be
done
through
another
hague
conference
in
this
direction
and
i
most
earnestly
urge
that
this
nation
do
all
in
its
power
to
try
to
further
the
movement
and
to
make
the
result
of
the
decisions
of
the
hague
conference
effective
i
earnestly
hope
that
the
conference
may
be
able
to
devise
some
way
to
make
arbitration
between
nations
the
customary
way
of
settling
international
disputes
in
all
save
a
few
classes
of
cases
which
should
themselves
be
as
sharply
defined
and
rigidly
limited
as
the
present
governmental
and
social
development
of
the
world
will
permit
if
possible
there
should
be
a
general
arbitration
treaty
negotiated
among
all
the
nations
represented
at
the
conference
neutral

rights
and
property
should
be
protected
at
sea
as
they
are
protected
on
land
there
should
be
an
international
agreement
to
this
purpose
and
a
similar
agreement
defining
contraband
of
war
during
the
last
century
there
has
been
a
distinct
diminution
in
the
number
of
wars
between
the
most
civilized
nations
international
relations
have
become
closer
and
the
development
of
the
hague
tribunal
is
not
only
a
symptom
of
this
growing
closeness
of
relationship
but
is
a
means
by
which
the
growth
can
be
furthered
our
aim
should
be
from
time
to
time
to
take
such
steps
as
may
be
possible
toward
creating
something
like
an
organization
of
the
civilized
nations
because
as
the
world
becomes
more
highly
organized
the
need
for
navies
and
armies
will
diminish
it
is
not
possible
to
secure
anything
like
an
immediate
disarmament
because
it
would
first
be
necessary
to
settle
what
peoples
are
on
the
whole
a
menace
to
the
rest
of
mankind
and
to
provide
against
the
disarmament
of
the
rest
being
turned
into
a
movement
which
would
really
chiefly
benefit
these
obnoxious
peoples
but
it
may
be
possible
to
exercise
some
check
upon
the
tendency
to
swell
indefinitely
the
budgets
for
military
expenditure
of
course
such
an
effort
could
succeed
only
if
it
did
not
attempt
to
do
too
much
and
if
it
were
undertaken
in
a
spirit
of
sanity
as
far
removed
as
possible
from
a
merely
hysterical
pseudophilanthropy
it
is
worth
while
pointing
out
that
since
the
end
of
the
insurrection
in
the
philippines
this
nation
has
shown
its
practical
faith
in
the
policy
of
disarmament
by
reducing
its
little
army
onethird
but
disarmament
can
never
be
of
prime
importance
there
is
more
need
to
get
rid
of
the
causes
of
war
than
of
the
implements
of
war
i
have
dwelt
much
on
the
dangers
to
be
avoided
by
steering
clear
of
any
mere
foolish
sentimentality
because
my
wish
for
peace
is
so
genuine
and
earnest
because
i
have
a
real
and
great
desire
that
this
second
hague
conference
may
mark
a
long
stride
forward
in
the
direction
of
securing
the
peace
of
justice
throughout
the
world
no
object
is
better
worthy
the
attention
of
enlightened
statesmanship
than
the
establishment
of
a
surer
method
than
now
exists
of
securing
justice
as
between
nations
both
for
the
protection
of
the
little
nations
and
for
the
prevention
of
war
between
the
big
nations
to
this
aim
we
should
endeavor
not
only
to
avert
bloodshed
but
above
all
effectively
to
strengthen
the
forces
of
right
the
golden
rule
should
be
and
as
the
world
grows
in
morality
it
will
be
the
guiding
rule
of
conduct
among
nations
as
among
individuals
though
the
golden
rule
must
not
be
construed
in
fantastic
manner
as
forbidding
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
this
mighty
and
free
republic
should
ever
deal
with
all
other
states
great
or
small
on
a
basis
of
high
honor
respecting
their
rights
as
jealously
as
it
safeguards
its
own
one
of
the
most
effective
instruments
for
peace
is
the
monroe
doctrine
as
it
has
been
and
is
being
gradually
developed
by
this
nation
and
accepted
by
other
nations
no
other
policy
could
have
been
as
efficient
in
promoting
peace
in
the
western
hemisphere
and
in
giving
to
each
nation
thereon
the
chance
to
develop
along
its
own
lines
if
we
had
refused
to
apply
the
doctrine
to
changing
conditions
it
would
now
be
completely
outworn
would
not
meet
any
of
the
needs
of
the
present
day
and
indeed
would
probably
by
this
time
have
sunk
into
complete
oblivion
it
is
useful
at
home
and
is
meeting
with
recognition
abroad
because
we
have
adapted
our
application
of
it
to
meet
the
growing
and
changing
needs
of
the
hemisphere
when
we
announce
a
policy
such
as
the
monroe
doctrine
we
thereby
commit
ourselves
to
the
consequences
of
the
policy
and
those
consequences
from
time
to
time
alter
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
claim
a
right
and
yet
shirk
the
responsibility
for
its
exercise
not
only
we
but
all
american
republics
who
are
benefited
by
the
existence
of
the
doctrine
must
recognize
the
obligations
each
nation
is
under
as
regards
foreign
peoples
no
less
than
its
duty
to
insist
upon
its
own
rights
that
our
rights
and
interests
are
deeply
concerned
in
the
maintenance
of
the
doctrine
is
so
clear
as
hardly
to
need
argument
this
is
especially
true
in
view
of
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
as
a
mere
matter
of
selfdefense
we
must
exercise
a
close
watch
over
the
approaches
to
this
canal
and
this
means
that
we
must
be
thoroughly
alive
to
our
interests
in
the
caribbean
sea
there
are
certain
essential
points
which
must
never
be
forgotten
as
regards
the
monroe
doctrine
in
the
first
place
we
must
as
a
nation
make
it
evident
that
we
do
not
intend
to
treat
it
in
any
shape
or
way
as
an
excuse
for
aggrandizement
on
our
part
at
the
expense
of
the
republics
to
the
south
we
must
recognize
the
fact
that
in
some
south
american
countries
there
has
been
much
suspicion
lest
we
should
interpret
the
monroe
doctrine
as
in
some
way
inimical
to
their
interests
and
we
must
try
to
convince
all
the
other
nations
of
this
continent
once
and
for
all
that
no
just
and
orderly
government
has
anything
to
fear
from
us
there
are
certain
republics
to
the
south
of
us
which
have
already
reached
such
a
point
of
stability
order
and
prosperity
that
they
themselves
though
as
yet
hardly
consciously
are
among
the
guarantors
of
this
doctrine
these
republics
we
now
meet
not
only
on
a
basis
of
entire
equality
but
in
a
spirit
of
frank
and
respectful
friendship
which
we
hope
is
mutual
if
all
of
the
republics
to
the
south
of
us
will
only
grow
as
those
to
which
i
allude
have
already
grown
all
need
for
us
to
be
the
especial
champions
of
the
doctrine
will
disappear
for
no
stable
and
growing
american
republic
wishes
to
see
some
great
nonamerican
military
power
acquire
territory
in
its
neighborhood
all
that
this
country
desires
is
that
the
other
republics
on
this
continent
shall
be
happy
and
prosperous
and
they
cannot
be
happy
and
prosperous
unless
they
maintain
order
within
their
boundaries
and
behave
with
a
just
regard
for
their
obligations
toward
outsiders
it
must
be
understood
that
under
no
circumstances
will
the
united
states
use
the
monroe
doctrine
as
a
cloak
for
territorial
aggression
we
desire
peace
with
all
the
world
but
perhaps
most
of
all
with
the
other
peoples
of
the
american
continent
there
are
of
course
limits
to
the
wrongs
which
any
selfrespecting
nation
can
endure
it
is
always
possible
that
wrong
actions
toward
this
nation
or
toward
citizens
of
this
nation
in
some
state
unable
to
keep
order
among
its
own
people
unable
to
secure
justice
from
outsiders
and
unwilling
to
do
justice
to
those
outsiders
who
treat
it
well
may
result
in
our
having
to
take
action
to
protect
our
rights
but
such
action
will
not
be
taken
with
a
view
to
territorial
aggression
and
it
will
be
taken
at
all
only
with
extreme
reluctance
and
when
it
has
become
evident
that
every
other
resource
has
been
exhausted
moreover
we
must
make
it
evident
that
we
do
not
intend
to
permit
the
monroe
doctrine
to
be
used
by
any
nation
on
this
continent
as
a
shield
to
protect
it
from
the
consequences
of
its
own
misdeeds
against
foreign
nations
if
a
republic
to
the
south
of
us
commits
a
tort
against
a
foreign
nation
such
as
an
outrage
against
a
citizen
of
that
nation
then
the
monroe
doctrine
does
not
force
us
to
interfere
to
prevent
punishment
of
the
tort
save
to
see
that
the
punishment
does
not
assume
the
form
of
territorial
occupation
in
any
shape
the
case
is
more
difficult
when
it
refers
to
a
contractual
obligation
our
own
government
has
always
refused
to
enforce
such
contractual
obligations
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
by
an
appeal
to
arms
it
is
much
to
be
wished
that
all
foreign
governments
would
take
the
same
view
but
they
do
not
and
in
consequence
we
are
liable
at
any
time
to
be
brought
face
to
face
with
disagreeable
alternatives
on
the
one
hand
this
country
would
certainly
decline
to
go
to
war
to
prevent
a
foreign
government
from
collecting
a
just
debt
on
the
other
hand
it
is
very
inadvisable
to
permit
any
foreign
power
to
take
possession
even
temporarily
of
the
custom
houses
of
an
american
republic
in
order
to
enforce
the
payment
of
its
obligations
for
such
temporary
occupation
might
turn
into
a
permanent
occupation
the
only
escape
from
these
alternatives
may
at
any
time
be
that
we
must
ourselves
undertake
to
bring
about
some
arrangement
by
which
so
much
as
possible
of
a
just
obligation
shall
be
paid
it
is
far
better
that
this
country
should
put
through
such
an
arrangement
rather
than
allow
any
foreign
country
to
undertake
it
to
do
so
insures
the
defaulting
republic
from
having
to
pay
debt
of
an
improper
character
under
duress
while
it
also
insures
honest
creditors
of
the
republic
from
being
passed
by
in
the
interest
of
dishonest
or
grasping
creditors
moreover
for
the
united
states
to
take
such
a
position
offers
the
only
possible
way
of
insuring
us
against
a
clash
with
some
foreign
power
the
position
is
therefore
in
the
interest
of
peace
as
well
as
in
the
interest
of
justice
it
is
of
benefit
to
our
people
it
is
of
benefit
to
foreign
peoples
and
most
of
all
it
is
really
of
benefit
to
the
people
of
the
country
concerned
this
brings
me
to
what
should
be
one
of
the
fundamental
objects
of
the
monroe
doctrine
we
must
ourselves
in
good
faith
try
to
help
upward
toward
peace
and
order
those
of
our
sister
republics
which
need
such
help
just
as
there
has
been
a
gradual
growth
of
the
ethical
element
in
the
relations
of
one
individual
to
another
so
we
are
even
though
slowly
more
and
more
coming
to
recognize
the
duty
of
bearing
one
anothers
burdens
not
only
as
among
individuals
but
also
as
among
nations
santo
domingo
in
her
turn
has
now
made
an
appeal
to
us
to
help
her
and
not
only
every
principle
of
wisdom
but
every
generous
instinct
within
us
bids
us
respond
to
the
appeal
it
is
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
whether
we
grant
the
aid
needed
by
santo
domingo
as
an
incident
to
the
wise
development
of
the
monroe
doctrine
or
because
we
regard
the
case
of
santo
domingo
as
standing
wholly
by
itself
and
to
be
treated
as
such
and
not
on
general
pr
inciples
or
with
any
reference
to
the
monroe
doctrine
the
important
point
is
to
give
the
needed
aid
and
the
case
is
certainly
sufficiently
peculiar
to
deserve
to
be
judged
purely
on
its
own
merits
the
conditions
in
santo
domingo
have
for
a
number
of
years
grown
from
bad
to
worse
until
a
year
ago
all
society
was
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
fortunately
just
at
this
time
a
ruler
sprang
up
in
santo
domingo
who
with
his
colleagues
saw
the
dangers
threatening
their
country
and
appealed
to
the
friendship
of
the
only
great
and
powerful
neighbor
who
possessed
the
power
and
as
they
hoped
also
the
will
to
help
them
there
was
imminent
danger
of
foreign
intervention
the
previous
rulers
of
santo
domingo
had
recklessly
incurred
debts
and
owing
to
her
internal
disorders
she
had
ceased
to
be
able
to
provide
means
of
paying
the
debts
the
patience
of
her
foreign
creditors
had
become
exhausted
and
at
least
two
foreign
nations
were
on
the
point
of
intervention
and
were
only
prevented
from
intervening
by
the
unofficial
assurance
of
this
government
that
it
would
itself
strive
to
help
santo
domingo
in
her
hour
of
need
in
the
case
of
one
of
these
nations
only
the
actual
opening
of
negotiations
to
this
end
by
our
government
prevented
the
seizure
of
territory
in
santo
domingo
by
a
european
power
of
the
debts
incurred
some
were
just
while
some
were
not
of
a
character
which
really
renders
it
obligatory
on
or
proper
for
santo
domingo
to
pay
them
in
full
but
she
could
not
pay
any
of
them
unless
some
stability
was
assured
her
government
and
people
accordingly
the
executive
department
of
our
government
negotiated
a
treaty
under
which
we
are
to
try
to
help
the
dominican
people
to
straighten
out
their
finances
this
treaty
is
pending
before
the
senate
in
the
meantime
a
temporary
arrangement
has
been
made
which
will
last
until
the
senate
has
had
time
to
take
action
upon
the
treaty
under
this
arrangement
the
dominican
government
has
appointed
americans
to
all
the
important
positions
in
the
customs
service
and
they
are
seeing
to
the
honest
collection
of
the
revenues
turning
over
per
cent
to
the
government
for
running
expenses
and
putting
the
other
per
cent
into
a
safe
depository
for
equitable
division
in
case
the
treaty
shall
be
ratified
among
the
various
creditors
whether
european
or
american
the
custom
houses
offer
wellnigh
the
only
sources
of
revenue
in
santo
domingo
and
the
different
revolutions
usually
have
as
their
real
aim
the
obtaining
of
these
custom
houses
the
mere
fact
that
the
collectors
of
customs
are
americans
that
they
are
performing
their
duties
with
efficiency
and
honesty
and
that
the
treaty
is
pending
in
the
senate
gives
a
certain
moral
power
to
the
government
of
santo
domingo
which
it
has
not
had
before
this
has
completely
discouraged
all
revolutionary
movement
while
it
has
already
produced
such
an
increase
in
the
revenues
that
the
government
is
actually
getting
more
from
the
per
cent
that
the
american
collectors
turn
over
to
it
than
it
got
formerly
when
it
took
the
entire
revenue
it
is
enabling
the
poor
harassed
people
of
santo
domingo
once
more
to
turn
their
attention
to
industry
and
to
be
free
from
the
cure
of
interminable
revolutionary
disturbance
it
offers
to
all
bonafide
creditors
american
and
european
the
only
really
good
chance
to
obtain
that
to
which
they
are
justly
entitled
while
it
in
return
gives
to
santo
domingo
the
only
opportunity
of
defense
against
claims
which
it
ought
not
to
pay
for
now
if
it
meets
the
views
of
the
senate
we
shall
ourselves
thoroughly
examine
all
these
claims
whether
american
or
foreign
and
see
that
none
that
are
improper
are
paid
there
is
of
course
opposition
to
the
treaty
from
dishonest
creditors
foreign
and
american
and
from
the
professional
revolutionists
of
the
island
itself
we
have
already
reason
to
believe
that
some
of
the
creditors
who
do
not
dare
expose
their
claims
to
honest
scrutiny
are
endeavoring
to
stir
up
sedition
in
the
island
and
opposition
to
the
treaty
in
the
meantime
i
have
exercised
the
authority
vested
in
me
by
the
joint
resolution
of
the
congress
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
arms
into
the
island
for
revolutionary
purposes
under
the
course
taken
stability
and
order
and
all
the
benefits
of
peace
are
at
last
coming
to
santo
domingo
danger
of
foreign
intervention
has
been
suspended
and
there
is
at
last
a
prospect
that
all
creditors
will
get
justice
no
more
and
no
less
if
the
arrangement
is
terminated
by
the
failure
of
the
treaty
chaos
will
follow
and
if
chaos
follows
sooner
or
later
this
government
may
be
involved
in
serious
difficulties
with
foreign
governments
over
the
island
or
else
may
be
forced
itself
to
intervene
in
the
island
in
some
unpleasant
fashion
under
the
proposed
treaty
the
independence
of
the
island
is
scrupulously
respected
the
danger
of
violation
of
the
monroe
doctrine
by
the
intervention
of
foreign
powers
vanishes
and
the
interference
of
our
government
is
minimized
so
that
we
shall
only
act
in
conjunction
with
the
santo
domingo
authorities
to
secure
the
proper
administration
of

customs
and
therefore
to
secure
the
payment
of
just
debts
and
to
secure
the
dominican
government
against
demands
for
unjust
debts
the
proposed
method
will
give
the
people
of
santo
domingo
the
same
chance
to
move
onward
and
upward
which
we
have
already
given
to
the
people
of
cuba
it
will
be
doubly
to
our
discredit
as
a
nation
if
we
fail
to
take
advantage
of
this
chance
for
it
will
be
of
damage
to
ourselves
and
it
will
be
of
incalculable
damage
to
santo
domingo
every
consideration
of
wise
policy
and
above
all
every
consideration
of
large
generosity
bids
us
meet
the
request
of
santo
domingo
as
we
are
now
trying
to
meet
it
we
cannot
consider
the
question
of
our
foreign
policy
without
at
the
same
time
treating
of
the
army
and
the
navy
we
now
have
a
very
small
army
indeed
one
wellnigh
infinitesimal
when
compared
with
the
army
of
any
other
large
nation
of
course
the
army
we
do
have
should
be
as
nearly
perfect
of
its
kind
and
for
its
size
as
is
possible
i
do
not
believe
that
any
army
in
the
world
has
a
better
average
of
enlisted
men
or
a
better
type
of
junior
officer
but
the
army
should
be
trained
to
act
effectively
in
a
mass
provision
should
be
made
by
sufficient
appropriations
for
manoeuvers
of
a
practical
kind
so
that
the
troops
may
learn
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
under
actual
service
conditions
every
march
for
instance
being
made
with
the
soldier
loaded
exactly
as
he
would
be
in
active
campaign
the
generals
and
colonels
would
thereby
have
opportunity
of
handling
regiments
brigades
and
divisions
and
the
commissary
and
medical
departments
would
be
tested
in
the
field
provision
should
be
made
for
the
exercise
at
least
of
a
brigade
and
by
preference
of
a
division
in
marching
and
embarking
at
some
point
on
our
coast
and
disembarking
at
some
other
point
and
continuing
its
march
the
number
of
posts
in
which
the
army
is
kept
in
time
of
peace
should
be
materially
diminished
and
the
posts
that
are
left
made
correspondingly
larger
no
local
interests
should
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
assembling
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
which
would
at
need
form
our
field
armies
in
stations
of
such
size
as
will
permit
the
best
training
to
be
given
to
the
personnel
of
all
grades
including
the
high
officers
and
staff
officers
to
accomplish
this
end
we
must
have
not
company
or
regimental
garrisons
but
brigade
and
division
garrisons
promotion
by
mere
seniority
can
never
result
in
a
thoroughly
efficient
corps
of
officers
in
the
higher
ranks
unless
there
accompanies
it
a
vigorous
weedingout
process
such
a
weedingout
processthat
is
such
a
process
of
selectionis
a
chief
feature
of
the
four
years
course
of
the
young
officer
at
west
point
there
is
no
good
reason
why
it
should
stop
immediately
upon
his
graduation
while
at
west
point
he
is
dropped
unless
he
comes
up
to
a
certain
standard
of
excellence
and
when
he
graduates
he
takes
rank
in
the
army
according
to
his
rank
of
graduation
the
results
are
good
at
west
point
and
there
should
be
in
the
army
itself
something
that
will
achieve
the
same
end
after
a
certain
age
has
been
reached
the
average
officer
is
unfit
to
do
good
work
below
a
certain
grade
provision
should
be
made
for
the
promotion
of
exceptionally
meritorious
men
over
the
heads
of
their
comrades
and
for
the
retirement
of
all
men
who
have
reached
a
given
age
without
getting
beyond
a
given
rank
this
age
of
retirement
of
course
changing
from
rank
to
rank
in
both
the
army
and
the
navy
there
should
be
some
principle
of
selection
that
is
of
promotion
for
merit
and
there
should
be
a
resolute
effort
to
eliminate
the
aged
officers
of
reputable
character
who
possess
no
special
efficiency
there
should
be
an
increase
in
the
coast
artillery
force
so
that
our
coast
fortifications
can
be
in
some
degree
adequately
manned
there
is
special
need
for
an
increase
and
reorganization
of
the
medical
department
of
the
army
in
both
the
army
and
navy
there
must
be
the
same
thorough
training
for
duty
in
the
staff
corps
as
in
the
fighting
line
only
by
such
training
in
advance
can
we
be
sure
that
in
actual
war
field
operations
and
those
at
sea
will
be
carried
on
successfully
the
importance
of
this
was
shown
conclusively
in
the
spanishamerican
and
the
russojapanese
wars
the
work
of
the
medical
departments
in
the
japanese
army
and
navy
is
especially
worthy
of
study
i
renew
my
recommendation
of
january
as
to
the
medical
department
of
the
army
and
call
attention
to
the
equal
importance
of
the
needs
of
the
staff
corps
of
the
navy
in
the
medical
department
of
the
navy
the
first
in
importance
is
the
reorganization
of
the
hospital
corps
on
the
lines
of
the
gallinger
bill
s
february
and
the
reapportionment
of
the
different
grades
of
the
medical
officers
to
meet
service
requirements
it
seems
advisable
also
that
medical
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
should
have
similar
rank
and
pay
in
their
respective
grades
so
that
their
duties
can
be
carried
on
without
friction
when
they
are
brought
together
the
base
hospitals
of
the
navy
should
be
p
ut
in
condition
to
meet
modern
requirements
and
hospital
ships
be
provided
unless
we
now
provide
with
ample
forethought
for
the
medical
needs
of
the
army
and
navy
appalling
suffering
of
a
preventable
kind
is
sure
to
occur
if
ever
the
country
goes
to
war
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
successful
administration
in
time
of
war
of
a
department
which
lacks
a
third
of
the
number
of
officers
necessary
to
perform
the
medical
service
in
time
of
peace
we
need
men
who
are
not
merely
doctors
they
must
be
trained
in
the
administration
of
military
medical
service
our
navy
must
relatively
to
the
navies
of
other
nations
always
be
of
greater
size
than
our
army
we
have
most
wisely
continued
for
a
number
of
years
to
build
up
our
navy
and
it
has
now
reached
a
fairly
high
standard
of
efficiency
this
standard
of
efficiency
must
not
only
be
maintained
but
increased
it
does
not
seem
to
be
necessary
however
that
the
navy
shouldat
least
in
the
immediate
futurebe
increased
beyond
the
present
number
of
units
what
is
now
clearly
necessary
is
to
substitute
efficient
for
inefficient
units
as
the
latter
become
worn
out
or
as
it
becomes
apparent
that
they
are
useless
probably
the
result
would
be
attained
by
adding
a
single
battleship
to
our
navy
each
year
the
superseded
or
outworn
vessels
being
laid
up
or
broken
up
as
they
are
thus
replaced
the
four
singleturret
monitors
built
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
spanish
war
for
instance
are
vessels
which
would
be
of
but
little
use
in
the
event
of
war
the
money
spent
upon
them
could
have
been
more
usefully
spent
in
other
ways
thus
it
would
have
been
far
better
never
to
have
built
a
single
one
of
these
monitors
and
to
have
put
the
money
into
an
ample
supply
of
reserve
guns
most
of
the
smaller
cruisers
and
gunboats
though
they
serve
a
useful
purpose
so
far
as
they
are
needed
for
international
police
work
would
not
add
to
the
strength
of
our
navy
in
a
conflict
with
a
serious
foe
there
is
urgent
need
of
providing
a
large
increase
in
the
number
of
officers
and
especially
in
the
number
of
enlisted
men
recent
naval
history
has
emphasized
certain
lessons
which
ought
not
to
but
which
do
need
emphasis
seagoing
torpedo
boats
or
destroyers
are
indispensable
not
only
for
making
night
attacks
by
surprise
upon
an
enemy
but
even
in
battle
for
finishing
already
crippled
ships
under
exceptional
circumstances
submarine
boats
would
doubtless
be
of
use
fast
scouts
are
needed
the
main
strength
of
the
navy
however
lies
and
can
only
lie
in
the
great
battleships
the
heavily
armored
heavily
gunned
vessels
which
decide
the
mastery
of
the
seas
heavyarmed
cruisers
also
play
a
most
useful
part
and
unarmed
cruisers
if
swift
enough
are
very
useful
as
scouts
between
antagonists
of
approximately
equal
prowess
the
comparative
perfection
of
the
instruments
of
war
will
ordinarily
determine
the
fight
but
it
is
of
course
true
that
the
man
behind
the
gun
the
man
in
the
engine
room
and
the
man
in
the
conning
tower
considered
not
only
individually
but
especially
with
regard
to
the
way
in
which
they
work
together
are
even
more
important
than
the
weapons
with
which
they
work
the
most
formidable
battleship
is
of
course
helpless
against
even
a
light
cruiser
if
the
men
aboard
it
are
unable
to
hit
anything
with
their
guns
and
thoroughly
wellhandled
cruisers
may
count
seriously
in
an
engagement
with
much
superior
vessels
if
the
men
aboard
the
latter
are
ineffective
whether
from
lack
of
training
or
from
any
other
cause
modern
warships
are
most
formidable
mechanisms
when
well
handled
but
they
are
utterly
useless
when
not
well
handled
and
they
cannot
be
handled
at
all
without
long
and
careful
training
this
training
can
under
no
circumstance
be
given
when
once
war
has
broken
out
no
fighting
ship
of
the
first
class
should
ever
be
laid
up
save
for
necessary
repairs
and
her
crew
should
be
kept
constantly
exercised
on
the
high
seas
so
that
she
may
stand
at
the
highest
point
of
perfection
to
put
a
new
and
untrained
crew
upon
the
most
powerful
battleship
and
send
it
out
to
meet
a
formidable
enemy
is
not
only
to
invite
but
to
insure
disaster
and
disgrace
to
improvise
crews
at
the
outbreak
of
a
war
so
far
as
the
serious
fighting
craft
are
concerned
is
absolutely
hopeless
if
the
officers
and
men
are
not
thoroughly
skilled
in
and
have
not
been
thoroughly
trained
to
their
duties
it
would
be
far
better
to
keep
the
ships
in
port
during
hostilities
than
to
send
them
against
a
formidable
opponent
for
the
result
could
only
be
that
they
would
be
either
sunk
or
captured
the
marksmanship
of
our
navy
is
now
on
the
whole
in
a
gratifying
condition
and
there
has
been
a
great
improvement
in
fleet
practice
we
need
additional
seamen
we
need
a
large
store
of
reserve
guns
we
need
sufficient
money
for
ample
target
practice
ample
practice
of
every
kind
at
sea
we
should
substitute
for
comparatively
inefficient
typesthe
old
thirdclass
battleship
texas
the
singleturreted
monitors
above
mentioned
and
indeed
all
the
monitors
and
some
of
the
old
cruisersefficient
modern
seagoing
vessels
seagoing
torpedoboat
destroyers
should
be
substituted
for
some
of
the
smaller
torpedo
boats
during
the
present
congress
there
need
be
no
additions
to
the
aggregate
number
of
units
of
the
navy
our
navy
though
very
small
relatively
to
the
navies
of
other
nations
is
for
the
present
sufficient
in
point
of
numbers
for
our
needs
and
while
we
must
constantly
strive
to
make
its
efficiency
higher
there
need
be
no
additions
to
the
total
of
ships
now
built
and
building
save
in
the
way
of
substitution
as
above
outlined
i
recommend
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
the
careful
consideration
of
the
congress
especially
with
a
view
to
the
legislation
therein
advocated
during
the
past
year
evidence
has
accumulated
to
confirm
the
expressions
contained
in
my
last
two
annual
messages
as
to
the
importance
of
revising
by
appropriate
legislation
our
system
of
naturalizing
aliens
i
appointed
last
march
a
commission
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
our
naturalization
laws
and
to
suggest
appropriate
measures
to
avoid
the
notorious
abuses
resulting
from
the
improvident
of
unlawful
granting
of
citizenship
this
commission
composed
of
an
officer
of
the
department
of

of
the
department
of
justice
and
of
the
department

discharged
the
duty
imposed
upon
it
and
has
submitted
a
report
which
will
be
transmitted
to
the
congress
for
its
consideration
and
i
hope
for
its
favor
able
action
the
distinguishing
recommendations
of
the
commission

the

district
courts
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
naturalization
of
the
alien
residents
of

cities
in
my
last
message
i
asked
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
urgent
need
of
action
to
make
our
criminal
law
more
effective
and
i
most
earnestly
request
that
you
pay
heed
to
the
report
of
the
attorney
general
on
this
subject
centuries
ago
it
was
especially
needful
to
throw
every
safeguard
round
the
accused
the
danger
then
was
lest
he
should
be
wronged
by
the
state
the
danger
is
now
exactly
the
reverse
our
laws
and
customs
tell
immensely
in
favor
of
the
criminal
and
against
the
interests
of
the
public
he
has
wronged
some
antiquated
and
outworn
rules
which
once
safeguarded
the
threatened
rights
of
private
citizens
now
merely
work
harm
to
the
general
body
politic
the
criminal
law
of
the
united
states
stands
in
urgent
need
of
revision
the
criminal
process
of
any
court
of
the
united
states
should
run
throughout
the
entire
territorial
extent
of
our
country
the
delays
of
the
criminal
law
no
less
than
of
the
civil
now
amount
to
a
very
great
evil
there
seems
to
be
no
statute
of
the
united
states
which
provides
for
the
punishment
of
a
united
states
attorney
or
other
officer
of
the
government
who
corruptly
agrees
to
wrongfully
do
or
wrongfully
refrain
from
doing
any
act
when
the
consideration
for
such
corrupt
agreement
is
other
than
one
possessing
money
value
this
ought
to
be
remedied
by
appropriate
legislation
legislation
should
also
be
enacted
to
cover
explicitly
unequivocally
and
beyond
question
breach
of
trust
in
the
shape
of
prematurely
divulging
official
secrets
by
an
officer
or
employe
of
the
united
states
and
to
provide
a
suitable
penalty
therefor
such
officer
or
employe
owes
the
duty
to
the
united
states
to
guard
carefully
and
not
to
divulge
or
in
any
manner
use
prematurely
information
which
is
accessible
to
the
officer
or
employe
by
reason
of
his
official
position
most
breaches
of
public
trust
are
already
covered
by
the
law
and
this
one
should
be
it
is
impossible
no
matter
how
much
care
is
used
to
prevent
the
occasional
appointment
to
the
public
service
of
a
man
who
when
tempted
proves
unfaithful
but
every
means
should
be
provided
to
detect
and
every
effort
made
to
punish
the
wrongdoer
so
far
as
in
my
power
see
each
and
every
such
wrongdoer
shall
be
relentlessly
hunted
down
in
no
instance
in
the
past
has
he
been
spared
in
no
instance
in
the
future
shall
he
be
spared
his
crime
is
a
crime
against
every
honest
man
in
the
nation
for
it
is
a
crime
against
the
whole
body
politic
yet
in
dwelling
on
such
misdeeds
it
is
unjust
not
to
add
that
they
are
altogether
exceptional
and
that
on
the
whole
the
employes
of
the
government
render
upright
and
faithful
service
to
the
people
there
are
exceptions
notably
in
one
or
two
bra
nches
of
the
service
but
at
no
time
in
the
nations
history
has
the
public
service
of
the
nation
taken
as
a
whole
stood
on
a
higher
plane
than
now
alike
as
regards
honesty
and
as
regards
efficiency
once
again
i
call
your
attention
to
the
condition
of
the
public
land
laws
recent
developments
have
given
new
urgency
to
the
need
for
such
changes
as
will
fit
these
laws
to
actual
present
conditions
the
honest
disposal
and
right
use
of
the
remaining
public
lands
is
of
fundamental
importance
the
iniquitous
methods
by
which
the
monopolizing
of
the
public
lands
is
being
brought
about
under
the
present
laws
are
becoming
more
generally
known
but
the
existing
laws
do
not
furnish
effective
remedies
the
recommendations
of
the
public
lands
commission
upon
this
subject
are
wise
and
should
be
given
effect
the
creation
of
small
irrigated
farms
under
the
reclamation
act
is
a
powerful
offset
to
the
tendency
of
certain
other
laws
to
foster
or
permit
monopoly
of
the
land
under
that
act
the
construction
of
great
irrigation
works
has
been
proceeding
rapidly
and
successfully
the
lands
reclaimed
are
eagerly
taken
up
and
the
prospect
that
the
policy
of
national
irrigation
will
accomplish
all
that
was
expected
of
it
is
bright
the
act
should
be
extended
to
include
the
state
of
texas
the
reclamation
act
derives
much
of
its
value
from
the
fact
that
it
tends
to
secure
the
greatest
possible
number
of
homes
on
the
land
and
to
create
communities
of
freeholders
in
part
by
settlement
on
public
lands
in
part
by
forcing
the
subdivision
of
large
private
holdings
before
they
can
get
water
from
government
irrigation
works
the
law
requires
that
no
right
to
the
use
of
water
for
land
in
private
ownership
shall
be
sold
for
a
tract
exceeding
acres
to
any
one
land
owner
this
provision
has
excited
active
and
powerful
hostility
but
the
success
of
the
law
itself
depends
on
the
wise
and
firm
enforcement
of
it
we
cannot
afford
to
substitute
tenants
for
freeholders
on
the
public
domain
the
greater
part
of
the
remaining
public
lands
can
not
be
irrigated
they
are
at
present
and
will
probably
always
be
of
greater
value
for
grazing
than
for
any
other
purpose
this
fact
has
led
to
the
grazing
homestead
of
acres
in
nebraska
and
to
the
proposed
extension
of
it
to
other
states
it
is
argued
that
a
family
can
not
be
supported
on
acres
of
arid
grazing
land
this
is
obviously
true
but
neither
can
a
family
be
supported
on
acres
of
much
of
the
land
to
which
it
is
proposed
to
apply
the
grazing
homestead
to
establish
universally
any
such
arbitrary
limit
would
be
unwise
at
the
present
time
it
would
probably
result
on
the
one
hand
in
enlarging
the
holdings
of
some
of
the
great
land
owners
and
on
the
other
in
needless
suffering
and
failure
on
the
part
of
a
very
considerable
proportion
of
the
bona
fide
settlers
who
give
faith
to
the
implied
assurance
of
the
government
that
such
an
area
is
sufficient
the
best
use
of
the
public
grazing
lands
requires
the
careful
examination
and
classification
of
these
lands
in
order
to
give
each
settler
land
enough
to
support
his
family
and
no
more
while
this
work
is
being
done
and
until
the
lands
are
settled
the
government
should
take
control
of
the
open
range
under
reasonable
regulations
suited
to
local
needs
following
the
general
policy
already
in
successful
operation
on
the
forest
reserves
it
is
probable
that
the
present
grazing
value
of
the
open
public
range
is
scarcely
more
than
half
what
it
once
was
or
what
it
might
easily
be
again
under
careful
regulation
the
forest
policy
of
the
administration
appears
to
enjoy
the
unbroken
support
of
the
people
the
great
users
of
timber
are
themselves
forwarding
the
movement
for
forest
preservation
all
organized
opposition
to
the
forest
preserves
in
the
west
has
disappeared
since
the
consolidation
of
all
government
forest
work
in
the
national
forest
service
there
has
been
a
rapid
and
notable
gain
in
the
usefulness
of
the
forest
reserves
to
the
people
and
in
public
appreciation
of
their
value
the
national
parks
within
or
adjacent
to
forest
reserves
should
be
transferred
to
the
charge
of
the
forest
service
also
the
national
government
already
does
something
in
connection
with
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
the
great
system
of
levees
along
the
lower
course
of
the
mississippi
in
my
judgment
it
should
do
much
more
to
the
spread
of
our
trade
in
peace
and
the
defense
of
our
flag
in
war
a
great
and
prosperous
merchant
marine
is
indispensable
we
should
have
ships
of
our
own
and
seamen
of
our
own
to
convey
our
goods
to
neutral
markets
and
in
case
of
need
to
reinforce
our
battle
line
it
cannot
but
be
a
source
of
regret
and
uneasiness
to
us
that
the
lines
of
communication
with
our
sister
republics
of
south
america
should
be
chiefly
under
foreign
control
it
is
not
a
good
thing
that
american
merchants
and
manufacturers
should
have
to
send
their
goods
and
letters
to
south
america
via
europe
if
they
wish
security
and
dispatch
even
on
the
pacific
where
our
ships
have
held
their
own
better
than
on
the
atlantic
our
merchant
flag
is
now
threatened
through
the
liberal
aid
bestowed
by
other
governments
on
their
own
steam
lines
i
ask
your
earnest
consideration
of
the
report
with
which
the
merchant
marine
commission
has
followed
its
long
and
careful
inquiry
i
again
heartily
commend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
tercentennial
celebration
at
jamestown
va
appreciating
the
desirability
of
this
commemoration
the
congress
passed
an
act
march
authorizing
in
the
year
on
and
near
the
waters
of
hampton
roads
in
the
state
of
virginia
an
international
naval
marine
and
military
celebration
in
honor
of
this
event
by
the
authority
vested
in
me
by
this
act
i
have
made
proclamation
of
said
celebration
and
have
issued
in
conformity
with
its
instructions
invitations
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
to
participate
by
sending
their
naval
vessels
and
such
military
organizations
as
may
be
practicable
this
celebration
would
fail
of
its
full
purpose
unless
it
were
enduring
in
its
results
and
commensurate
with
the
importance
of
the
event
to
be
celebrated
the
event
from
which
our
nation
dates
its
birth
i
earnestly
hope
that
this
celebration
already
indorsed
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
by
the
legislatures
of
sixteen
states
since
the
action
of
the
congress
will
receive
such
additional
aid
at
your
hands
as
will
make
it
worthy
of
the
great
event
it
is
intended
to
celebrate
and
thereby
enable
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
make
provision
for
the
exhibition
of
its
own
resources
and
likewise
enable
our
people
who
have
undertaken
the
work
of
such
a
celebration
to
provide
suitable
and
proper
entertainment
and
instruction
in
the
historic
events
of
our
country
for
all
who
may
visit
the
exposition
and
to
whom
we
have
tendered
our
hospitality
it
is
a
matter
of
unmixed
satisfaction
once
more
to
call
attention
to
the
excellent
work
of
the
pension
bureau
for
the
veterans
of
the
civil
war
have
a
greater
claim
upon
us
than
any
other
class
of
our
citizens
to
them
first
of
all
among
our
people
honor
is
due
seven
years
ago
my
lamented
predecessor
president
mckinley
stated
that
the
time
had
come
for
the
nation
to
care
for
the
graves
of
the
confederate
dead
i
recommend
that
the
congress
take
action
toward
this
end
the
first
need
is
to
take
charge
of
the
graves
of
the
confederate
dead
who
died
in
northern
prisons
the
question
of
immigration
is
of
vital
interest
to
this
country
in
the
year
ending
june
there
came
to
the
united
states
alien
immigrants
in
other
words
in
the
single
year
that
has
just
elapsed
there
came
to
this
country
a
greater
number
of
people
than
came
here
during
the
one
hundred
and
sixtynine
years
of
our
colonial
life
which
intervened
between
the
first
landing
at
jamestown
and
the
declaration
of
independence
it
is
clearly
shown
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
general
of
immigration
that
while
much
of
this
enormous
immigration
is
undoubtedly
healthy
and
natural
a
considerable
proportion
is
undesirable
from
one
reason
or
another
moreover
a
considerable
proportion
of
it
probably
a
very
large
proportion
including
most
of
the
undesirable
class
does
not
come
here
of
its
own
initiative
but
because
of
the
activity
of
the
agents
of
the
great
transportation
companies
these
agents
are
distributed
throughout
europe
and
by
the
offer
of
all
kinds
of
inducements
they
wheedle
and
cajole
many
immigrants
often
against
their
best
interest
to
come
here
the
most
serious
obstacle
we
have
to
encounter
in
the
effort
to
secure
a
proper
regulation
of
the
immigration
to
these
shores
arises
from
the
determined
opposition
of
the
foreign
steamship
lines
who
have
no
interest
whatever
in
the
matter
save
to
increase
the
returns
on
their
capital
by
carrying
masses
of
immigrants
hither
in
the
steerage
quarters
of
their
ships
as
i
said
in
my
last
message
to
the
congress
we
cannot
have
too
much
immigration
of
the
right
sort
and
we
should
have
none
whatever
of
the
wrong
sort
of
course
it
is
desirable
that
even
the
right
kind
of
immigration
should
be
properly
distributed
in
this
country
we
need
more
of
such
immigration
for
the
south
and
special
effort
should
be
made
to
secure
it
perhaps
it
would
be
possible
to
limit
the
number
of
immigrants
allowed
to
come
in
any
one
year
to
new
york
and
other
northern
cities
while
leaving
unlimited
the
number
allowed
to
come
to
the
south
always
provided
however
that
a
stricter
effort
is
made
to
see
that
only
immigrants
of
the
right
kind
come
to
our
country
anywhere
in
actual
practice
it
has
proved
so
difficult
to
enforce
the
migration
laws
where
long
stretches
of
frontier
marked
by
an
imaginary
line
alone
intervene
between
us
and
our
neighbors
that
i
recommend
that
no
immigrants
be
allowed
to
come
in
from
canada
and
mexico
save
natives
of
the
two
countries
themselves
as
much
as
possible
should
be
done
to
distribute
the
immigrants
upon
the
land
and
keep
them
away
from
the
contested
tenementhouse
districts
of
the
great
cities
but
distribution
is
a
palliative
not
a
cure
the
prime
need
is
to
keep
out
all
immigrants
who
will
not
make
good
americ
an
citizens
the
laws
now
existing
for
the
exclusion
of
undesirable
immigrants
should
be
strengthened
adequate
means
should
be
adopted
enforced
by
sufficient
penalties
to
compel
steamship
companies
engaged
in
the
passenger
business
to
observe
in
good
faith
the
law
which
forbids
them
to
encourage
or
solicit
immigration
to
the
united
states
moreover
there
should
be
a
sharp
limitation
imposed
upon
all
vessels
coming
to
our
ports
as
to
the
number
of
immigrants
in
ratio
to
the
tonnage
which
each
vessel
can
carry
this
ratio
should
be
high
enough
to
insure
the
coming
hither
of
as
good
a
class
of
aliens
as
possible
provision
should
be
made
for
the
surer
punishment
of
those
who
induce
aliens
to
come
to
this
country
under
promise
or
assurance
of
employment
it
should
be
made
possible
to
inflict
a
sufficiently
heavy
penalty
on
any
employer
violating
this
law
to
deter
him
from
taking
the
risk
it
seems
to
me
wise
that
there
should
be
an
international
conference
held
to
deal
with
this
question
of
immigration
which
has
more
than
a
merely
national
significance
such
a
conference
could
among
other
things
enter
at
length
into
the
method
for
securing
a
thorough
inspection
of
wouldbe
immigrants
at
the
ports
from
which
they
desire
to
embark
before
permitting
them
to
embark
in
dealing
with
this
question
it
is
unwise
to
depart
from
the
old
american
tradition
and
to
discriminate
for
or
against
any
man
who
desires
to
come
here
and
become
a
citizen
save
on
the
ground
of
that
mans
fitness
for
citizenship
it
is
our
right
and
duty
to
consider
his
moral
and
social
quality
his
standard
of
living
should
be
such
that
he
will
not
by
pressure
of
competition
lower
the
standard
of
living
of
our
own
wageworkers
for
it
must
ever
be
a
prime
object
of
our
legislation
to
keep
high
their
standard
of
living
if
the
man
who
seeks
to
come
here
is
from
the
moral
and
social
standpoint
of
such
a
character
as
to
bid
fair
to
add
value
to
the
community
he
should
be
heartily
welcomed
we
cannot
afford
to
pay
heed
to
whether
he
is
of
one
creed
or
another
of
one
nation
or
another
we
cannot
afford
to
consider
whether
he
is
catholic
or
protestant
jew
or
gentile
whether
he
is
englishman
or
irishman
frenchman
or
german
japanese
italian
scandinavian
slav
or
magyar
what
we
should
desire
to
find
out
is
the
individual
quality
of
the
individual
man
in
my
judgment
with
this
end
in
view
we
shall
have
to
prepare
through
our
own
agents
a
far
more
rigid
inspection
in
the
countries
from
which
the
immigrants
come
it
will
be
a
great
deal
better
to
have
fewer
immigrants
but
all
of
the
right
kind
than
a
great
number
of
immigrants
many
of
whom
are
necessarily
of
the
wrong
kind
as
far
as
possible
we
wish
to
limit
the
immigration
to
this
country
to
persons
who
propose
to
become
citizens
of
this
country
and
we
can
well
afford
to
insist
upon
adequate
scrutiny
of
the
character
of
those
who
are
thus
proposed
for
future
citizenship
there
should
be
an
increase
in
the
stringency
of
the
laws
to
keep
out
insane
idiotic
epileptic
and
pauper
immigrants
but
this
is
by
no
means
enough
not
merely
the
anarchist
but
every
man
of
anarchistic
tendencies
all
violent
and
disorderly
people
all
people
of
bad
character
the
incompetent
the
lazy
the
vicious
the
physically
unfit
defective
or
degenerate
should
be
kept
out
the
stocks
out
of
which
american
citizenship
is
to
be
built
should
be
strong
and
healthy
sound
in
body
mind
and
character
if
it
be
objected
that
the
government
agents
would
not
always
select
well
the
answer
is
that
they
would
certainly
select
better
than
do
the
agents
and
brokers
of
foreign
steamship
companies
the
people
who
now
do
whatever
selection
is
done
the
questions
arising
in
connection
with
chinese
immigration
stand
by
themselves
the
conditions
in
china
are
such
that
the
entire
chinese
coolie
class
that
is
the
class
of
chinese
laborers
skilled
and
unskilled
legitimately
come
under
the
head
of
undesirable
immigrants
to
this
country
because
of
their
numbers
the
low
wages
for
which
they
work
and
their
low
standard
of
living
not
only
is
it
to
the
interest
of
this
country
to
keep
them
out
but
the
chinese
authorities
do
not
desire
that
they
should
be
admitted
at
present
their
entrance
is
prohibited
by
laws
amply
adequate
to
accomplish
this
purpose
these
laws
have
been
are
being
and
will
be
thoroughly
enforced
the
violations
of
them
are
so
few
in
number
as
to
be
infinitesimal
and
can
be
entirely
disregarded
this
is
no
serious
proposal
to
alter
the
immigration
law
as
regards
the
chinese
laborer
skilled
or
unskilled
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
any
man
feeling
or
affecting
to
feel
the
slightest
alarm
on
the
subject
but
in
the
effort
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
excluding
chinese
laborers
chinese
coolies
grave
injustice
and
wrong
have
been
done
by
this
nation
to
the
people
of
china
and
therefore
ultimately
to
this
nation
itself
chinese
students
business
and
professional
men
of
all
kindsnot
only
merchants
but
bankers
doctors
manufacturers
professors
travelers
and
the
likeshould
be
encouraged
to
come
here
and
treated
on
precisely
the
same
footing
that
we
treat
students
business
men
travelers
and
the
like
of
other
nations
our
laws
and
treaties
should
be
framed
not
so
as
to
put
these
people
in
the
excepted
classes
but
to
state
that
we
will
admit
all
chinese
except
chinese
of
the
coolie
class
chinese
skilled
or
unskilled
laborers
there
would
not
be
the
least
danger
that
any
such
provision
would
result
in
any
relaxation
of
the
law
about
laborers
these
will
under
all
conditions
be
kept
out
absolutely
but
it
will
be
more
easy
to
see
that
both
justice
and
courtesy
are
shown
as
they
ought
to
be
shown
to
other
chinese
if
the
law
or
treaty
is
framed
as
above
suggested
examinations
should
be
completed
at
the
port
of
departure
from
china
for
this
purpose
there
should
be
provided
a
more
adequate
consular
service
in
china
than
we
now
have
the
appropriations
both
for
the
offices
of
the
consuls
and
for
the
office
forces
in
the
consulates
should
be
increased
as
a
people
we
have
talked
much
of
the
open
door
in
china
and
we
expect
and
quite
rightly
intend
to
insist
upon
justice
being
shown
us
by
the
chinese
but
we
cannot
expect
to
receive
equity
unless
we
do
equity
we
cannot
ask
the
chinese
to
do
to
us
what
we
are
unwilling
to
do
to
them
they
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
exclude
our
laboring
men
if
our
laboring
men
threatened
to
come
into
their
country
in
such
numbers
as
to
jeopardize
the
wellbeing
of
the
chinese
population
and
as
mutatis
mutandis
these
were
the
conditions
with
which
chinese
immigration
actually
brought
this
people
face
to
face
we
had
and
have
a
perfect
right
which
the
chinese
government
in
no
way
contests
to
act
as
we
have
acted
in
the
matter
of
restricting
coolie
immigration
that
this
right
exists
for
each
country
was
explicitly
acknowledged
in
the
last
treaty
between
the
two
countries
but
we
must
treat
the
chinese
student
traveler
and
business
man
in
a
spirit
of
the
broadest
justice
and
courtesy
if
we
expect
similar
treatment
to
be
accorded
to
our
own
people
of
similar
rank
who
go
to
china
much
trouble
has
come
during
the
past
summer
from
the
organized
boycott
against
american
goods
which
has
been
started
in
china
the
main
factor
in
producing
this
boycott
has
been
the
resentment
felt
by
the
students
and
business
people
of
china
by
all
the
chinese
leaders
against
the
harshness
of
our
law
toward
educated
chinamen
of
the
professional
and
business
classes
this
government
has
the
friendliest
feeling
for
china
and
desires
chinas
wellbeing
we
cordially
sympathize
with
the
announced
purpose
of
japan
to
stand
for
the
integrity
of
china
such
an
attitude
tends
to
the
peace
of
the
world
the
civil
service
law
has
been
on
the
statute
books
for
twentytwo
years
every
president
and
a
vast
majority
of
heads
of
departments
who
have
been
in
office
during
that
period
have
favored
a
gradual
extension
of
the
merit
system
the
more
thoroughly
its
principles
have
been
understood
the
greater
has
been
the
favor
with
which
the
law
has
been
regarded
by
administration
officers
any
attempt
to
carry
on
the
great
executive
departments
of
the
government
without
this
law
would
inevitably
result
in
chaos
the
civil
service
commissioners
are
doing
excellent
work
and
their
compensation
is
inadequate
considering
the
service
they
perform
the
statement
that
the
examinations
are
not
practical
in
character
is
based
on
a
misapprehension
of
the
practice
of
the
commission
the
departments
are
invariably
consulted
as
to
the
requirements
desired
and
as
to
the
character
of
questions
that
shall
be
asked
general
invitations
are
frequently
sent
out
to
all
heads
of
departments
asking
whether
any
changes
in
the
scope
or
character
of
examinations
are
required
in
other
words
the
departments
prescribe
the
requirements
and
qualifications
desired
and
the
civil
service
commission
cooperates
with
them
in
securing
persons
with
these
qualifications
and
insuring
open
and
impartial
competition
in
a
large
number
of
examinations
as
for
example
those
for
trades
positions
there
are
no
educational
requirements
whatever
and
a
person
who
can
neither
read
nor
write
may
pass
with
a
high
average
vacancies
in
the
service
are
filled
with
reasonable
expedition
and
the
machinery
of
the
commission
which
reaches
every
part
of
the
country
is
the
best
agency
that
has
yet
been
devised
for
finding
people
with
the
most
suitable
qualifications
for
the
various
offices
to
be
filled
written
competitive
examinations
do
not
make
an
ideal
method
for
filling
positions
but
they
do
represent
an
immeasurable
advance
upon
the
spoils
method
under
which
outside
politicians
really
make
the
appointments
nominally
made
by
the
executive
officers
the
appointees
being
chosen
by
the
politicians
in
question
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
for
reasons
totally
unconnected
with
the
needs
of
the
service
or
of
the
public
statistics
gathered
by
the
census
bureau
show
that
the
tenure
of
office
in
the
government
service
does
not
differ
materially
from
that
enjoyed
by
employes
of
large
business
corporations
heads
of
execu
tive
departments
and
members
of
the
commission
have
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
rule
requiring
a
filing
of
charges
and
three
days
notice
before
an
employe
could
be
separated
from
the
service
for
inefficiency
has
served
no
good
purpose
whatever
because
that
is
not
a
matter
upon
which
a
hearing
of
the
employe
found
to
be
inefficient
can
be
of
any
value
and
in
practice
the
rule
providing
for
such
notice
and
hearing
has
merely
resulted
in
keeping
in
a
certain
number
of
incompetents
because
of
the
reluctance
of
the
heads
of
departments
and
bureau
chiefs
to
go
through
the
required
procedure
experience
has
shown
that
this
rule
is
wholly
ineffective
to
save
any
man
if
a
superior
for
improper
reasons
wishes
to
remove
him
and
is
mischievous
because
it
sometimes
serves
to
keep
in
the
service
incompetent
men
not
guilty
of
specific
wrongdoing
having
these
facts
in
view
the
rule
has
been
amended
by
providing
that
where
the
inefficiency
or
incapacity
comes
within
the
personal
knowledge
of
the
head
of
a
department
the
removal
may
be
made
without
notice
the
reasons
therefor
being
filed
and
made
a
record
of
the
department
the
absolute
right
of
the
removal
rests
where
it
always
has
rested
with
the
head
of
a
department
any
limitation
of
this
absolute
right
results
in
grave
injury
to
the
public
service
the
change
is
merely
one
of
procedure
it
was
much
needed
and
it
is
producing
good
results
the
civil
service
law
is
being
energetically
and
impartially
enforced
and
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
complaints
of
violations
of
either
the
law
or
rules
are
discovered
to
be
unfounded
in
this
respect
this
law
compares
very
favorably
with
any
other
federal
statute
the
question
of
politics
in
the
appointment
and
retention
of
the
men
engaged
in
merely
ministerial
work
has
been
practically
eliminated
in
almost
the
entire
field
of
government
employment
covered
by
the
civil
service
law
the
action
of
the
congress
in
providing
the
commission
with
its
own
force
instead
of
requiring
it
to
rely
on
detailed
clerks
has
been
justified
by
the
increased
work
done
at
a
smaller
cost
to
the
government
i
urge
upon
the
congress
a
careful
consideration
of
the
recommendations
contained
in
the
annual
report
of
the
commission
our
copyright
laws
urgently
need
revision
they
are
imperfect
in
definition
confused
and
inconsistent
in
expression
they
omit
provision
for
many
articles
which
under
modern
reproductive
processes
are
entitled
to
protection
they
impose
hardships
upon
the
copyright
proprietor
which
are
not
essential
to
the
fair
protection
of
the
public
they
are
difficult
for
the
courts
to
interpret
and
impossible
for
the
copyright
office
to
administer
with
satisfaction
to
the
public
attempts
to
improve
them
by
amendment
have
been
frequent
no
less
than
twelve
acts
for
the
purpose
having
been
passed
since
the
revised
statutes
to
perfect
them
by
further
amendment
seems
impracticable
a
complete
revision
of
them
is
essential
such
a
revision
to
meet
modern
conditions
has
been
found
necessary
in
germany
austria
sweden
and
other
foreign
countries
and
bills
embodying
it
are
pending
in
england
and
the
australian
colonies
it
has
been
urged
here
and
proposals
for
a
commission
to
undertake
it
have
from
time
to
time
been
pressed
upon
the
congress
the
inconveniences
of
the
present
conditions
being
so
great
an
attempt
to
frame
appropriate
legislation
has
been
made
by
the
copyright
office
which
has
called
conferences
of
the
various
interests
especially
and
practically
concerned
with
the
operation
of
the
copyright
laws
it
has
secured
from
them
suggestions
as
to
the
changes
necessary
it
has
added
from
its
own
experience
and
investigations
and
it
has
drafted
a
bill
which
embodies
such
of
these
changes
and
additions
as
after
full
discussion
and
expert
criticism
appeared
to
be
sound
and
safe
in
form
this
bill
would
replace
the
existing
insufficient
and
inconsistent
laws
by
one
general
copyright
statute
it
will
be
presented
to
the
congress
at
the
coming
session
it
deserves
prompt
consideration
i
recommend
that
a
law
be
enacted
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
in
misbranded
and
adulterated
foods
drinks
and
drugs
such
law
would
protect
legitimate
manufacture
and
commerce
and
would
tend
to
secure
the
health
and
welfare
of
the
consuming
public
traffic
in
foodstuffs
which
have
been
debased
or
adulterated
so
as
to
injure
health
or
to
deceive
purchasers
should
be
forbidden
the
law
forbidding
the
emission
of
dense
black
or
gray
smoke
in
the
city
of
washington
has
been
sustained
by
the
courts
something
has
been
accomplished
under
it
but
much
remains
to
be
done
if
we
would
preserve
the
capital
city
from
defacement
by
the
smoke
nuisance
repeated
prosecutions
under
the
law
have
not
had
the
desired
effect
i
recommend
that
it
be
made
more
stringent
by
increasing
both
the
minimum
and
maximum
fine
by
providing
for
imprisonment
in
cases
of
repeated
violation
and
by
affording
the
remedy
of
injunction
against
the
continuation
of
the
operation
of
plants
which
are
persistent
offenders
i
recommend
also
an
increase
in
the
number
of
inspectors
whose
duty
it
shall
be
to
detect
violations
of
the
act
i
call
your
attention
to
the
generous
act
of
the
state
of
california
in
conferring
upon
the
united
states
government
the
ownership
of
the
yosemite
valley
and
the
mariposa
big
tree
grove
there
should
be
no
delay
in
accepting
the
gift
and
appropriations
should
be
made
for
the
including
thereof
in
the
yosemite
national
park
and
for
the
care
and
policing
of
the
park
california
has
acted
most
wisely
as
well
as
with
great
magnanimity
in
the
matter
there
are
certain
mighty
natural
features
of
our
land
which
should
be
preserved
in
perpetuity
for
our
children
and
our
childrens
children
in
my
judgment
the
grand
canyon
of
the
colorado
should
be
made
into
a
national
park
it
is
greatly
to
be
wished
that
the
state
of
new
york
should
copy
as
regards
niagara
what
the
state
of
california
has
done
as
regards
the
yosemite
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
preservation
of
niagara
falls
in
all
their
beauty
and
majesty
if
the
state
cannot
see
to
this
then
it
is
earnestly
to
be
wished
that
she
should
be
willing
to
turn
it
over
to
the
national
government
which
should
in
such
case
if
possible
in
conjunction
with
the
canadian
government
assume
the
burden
and
responsibility
of
preserving
unharmed
niagara
falls
just
as
it
should
gladly
assume
a
similar
burden
and
responsibility
for
the
yosemite
national
park
and
as
it
has
already
assumed
them
for
the
yellowstone
national
park
adequate
provision
should
be
made
by
the
congress
for
the
proper
care
and
supervision
of
all
these
national
parks
the
boundaries
of
the
yellowstone
national
park
should
be
extended
to
the
south
and
east
to
take
in
such
portions
of
the
abutting
forest
reservations
as
will
enable
the
government
to
protect
the
elk
on
their
winter
range
the
most
characteristic
animal
of
the
western
plains
was
the
great
shaggymaned
wild
ox
the
bison
commonly
known
as
buffalo
small
fragments
of
herds
exist
in
a
domesticated
state
here
and
there
a
few
of
them
in
the
yellowstone
park
such
a
herd
as
that
on
the
flathead
reservation
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
out
of
existence
either
on
some
reservation
or
on
some
forest
reserve
like
the
wichita
reserve
and
game
refuge
provision
should
be
made
for
the
preservation
of
such
a
herd
i
believe
that
the
scheme
would
be
of
economic
advantage
for
the
robe
of
the
buffalo
is
of
high
market
value
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
robe
of
the
crossbred
animals
i
call
your
especial
attention
to
the
desirability
of
giving
to
the
members
of
the
life
saving
service
pensions
such
as
are
given
to
firemen
and
policemen
in
all
our
great
cities
the
men
in
the
life
saving
service
continually
and
in
the
most
matter
of
fact
way
do
deeds
such
as
make
americans
proud
of
their
country
they
have
no
political
influence
and
they
live
in
such
remote
places
that
the
really
heroic
services
they
continually
render
receive
the
scantiest
recognition
from
the
public
it
is
unjust
for
a
great
nation
like
this
to
permit
these
men
to
become
totally
disabled
or
to
meet
death
in
the
performance
of
their
hazardous
duty
and
yet
to
give
them
no
sort
of
reward
if
one
of
them
serves
thirty
years
of
his
life
in
such
a
position
he
should
surely
be
entitled
to
retire
on
half
pay
as
a
fireman
or
policeman
does
and
if
he
becomes
totally
incapacitated
through
accident
or
sickness
or
loses
his
health
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
he
or
his
family
should
receive
a
pension
just
as
any
soldier
should
i
call
your
attention
with
especial
earnestness
to
this
matter
because
it
appeals
not
only
to
our
judgment
but
to
our
sympathy
for
the
people
on
whose
behalf
i
ask
it
are
comparatively
few
in
number
render
incalculable
service
of
a
particularly
dangerous
kind
and
have
no
one
to
speak
for
them
during
the
year
just
past
the
phase
of
the
indian
question
which
has
been
most
sharply
brought
to
public
attention
is
the
larger
legal
significance
of
the
indians
induction
into
citizenship
this
has
made
itself
manifest
not
only
in
a
great
access
of
litigation
in
which
the
citizen
indian
figures
as
a
party
defendant
and
in
a
more
widespread
disposition
to
levy
local
taxation
upon
his
personalty
but
in
a
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
which
struck
away
the
main
prop
on
which
has
hitherto
rested
the
governments
benevolent
effort
to
protect
him
against
the
evils
of
intemperance
the
court
holds
in
effect
that
when
an
indian
becomes
by
virtue
of
an
allotment
of
land
to
him
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
which
his
land
is
situated
he
passes
from
under
federal
control
in
such
matters
as
this
and
the
acts
of
the
congress
prohibiting
the
sale
or
gift
to
him
of
intoxicants
become
substantially
inoperative
it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
the
states
and
municipalities
of
the
west
which
have
most
at
stake
in
the
welfare
of
the
indians
are
taking
up
this
subject
and
are
trying
to
supply
in
a
measure
at
least
the
abdication
of
its
trusteeship
forced
upon
the
federal
government
nevertheless
i
would
urgently
pr
ess
upon
the
attention
of
the
congress
the
question
whether
some
amendment
of
the
internal
revenue
laws
might
not
be
of
aid
in
prosecuting
those
malefactors
known
in
the
indian
country
as
bootleggers
who
are
engaged
at
once
in
defrauding
the
united
states
treasury
of
taxes
and
what
is
far
more
important
in
debauching
the
indians
by
carrying
liquors
illicitly
into
territory
still
completely
under
federal
jurisdiction
among
the
crying
present
needs
of
the
indians
are
more
day
schools
situated
in
the
midst
of
their
settlements
more
effective
instruction
in
the
industries
pursued
on
their
own
farms
and
a
more
liberal
tension
of
the
fieldmatron
service
which
means
the
education
of
the
indian
women
in
the
arts
of
home
making
until
the
mothers
are
well
started
in
the
right
direction
we
cannot
reasonably
expect
much
from
the
children
who
are
soon
to
form
an
integral
part
of
our
american
citizenship
moreover
the
excuse
continually
advanced
by
male
adult
indians
for
refusing
offers
of
remunerative
employment
at
a
distance
from
their
homes
is
that
they
dare
not
leave
their
families
too
long
out
of
their
sight
one
effectual
remedy
for
this
state
of
things
is
to
employ
the
minds
and
strengthen
the
moral
fibre
of
the
indian
womenthe
end
to
which
the
work
of
the
field
matron
is
especially
directed
i
trust
that
the
congress
will
make
its
appropriations
for
indian
day
schools
and
field
matrons
as
generous
as
may
consist
with
the
other
pressing
demands
upon
its
providence
during
the
last
year
the
philippine
islands
have
been
slowly
recovering
from
the
series
of
disasters
which
since
american
occupation
have
greatly
reduced
the
amount
of
agricultural
products
below
what
was
produced
in
spanish
times
the
war
the
rinderpest
the
locusts
the
drought
and
the
cholera
have
been
united
as
causes
to
prevent
a
return
of
the
prosperity
much
needed
in
the
islands
the
most
serious
is
the
destruction
by
the
rinderpest
of
more
than
per
cent
of
the
draught
cattle
because
it
will
take
several
years
of
breeding
to
restore
the
necessary
number
of
these
indispensable
aids
to
agriculture
the
commission
attempted
to
supply
by
purchase
from
adjoining
countries
the
needed
cattle
but
the
experiments
made
were
unsuccessful
most
of
the
cattle
imported
were
unable
to
withstand
the
change
of
climate
and
the
rigors
of
the
voyage
and
died
from
other
diseases
than
rinderpest
the
income
of
the
philippine
government
has
necessarily
been
reduced
by
reason
of
the
business
and
agricultural
depression
in
the
islands
and
the
government
has
been
obliged
to
exercise
great
economy
to
cut
down
its
expenses
to
reduce
salaries
and
in
every
way
to
avoid
a
deficit
it
has
adopted
an
internal
revenue
law
imposing
taxes
on
cigars
cigarettes
and
distilled
liquors
and
abolishing
the
old
spanish
industrial
taxes
the
law
has
not
operated
as
smoothly
as
was
hoped
and
although
its
principle
is
undoubtedly
correct
it
may
need
amendments
for
the
purpose
of
reconciling
the
people
to
its
provisions
the
income
derived
from
it
has
partly
made
up
for
the
reduction
in
customs
revenue
there
has
been
a
marked
increase
in
the
number
of
filipinos
employed
in
the
civil
service
and
a
corresponding
decrease
in
the
number
of
americans
the
government
in
every
one
of
its
departments
has
been
rendered
more
efficient
by
elimination
of
undesirable
material
and
the
promotion
of
deserving
public
servants
improvements
of
harbors
roads
and
bridges
continue
although
the
cutting
down
of
the
revenue
forbids
the
expenditure
of
any
great
amount
from
current
income
for
these
purposes
steps
are
being
taken
by
advertisement
for
competitive
bids
to
secure
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
miles
of
railway
by
private
corporations
under
the
recent
enabling
legislation
of
the
congress
the
transfer
of
the
friar
lands
in
accordance
with
the
contract
made
some
two
years
ago
has
been
completely
effected
and
the
purchase
money
paid
provision
has
just
been
made
by
statute
for
the
speedy
settlement
in
a
special
proceeding
in
the
supreme
court
of
controversies
over
the
possession
and
title
of
church
buildings
and
rectories
arising
between
the
roman
catholic
church
and
schismatics
claiming
under
ancient
municipalities
negotiations
and
hearings
for
the
settlement
of
the
amount
due
to
the
roman
catholic
church
for
rent
and
occupation
of
churches
and
rectories
by
the
army
of
the
united
states
are
in
progress
and
it
is
hoped
a
satisfactory
conclusion
may
be
submitted
to
the
congress
before
the
end
of
the
session
tranquillity
has
existed
during
the
past
year
throughout
the
archipelago
except
in
the
province
of
cavite
the
province
of
batangas
and
the
province
of
samar
and
in
the
island
of
jolo
among
the
moros
the
jolo
disturbance
was
put
an
end
to
by
several
sharp
and
short
engagements
and
now
peace
prevails
in
the
moro
province
cavite
the
mother
of
ladrones
in
the
spanish
times
is
so
permeated
with
the
traditional
sympathy
of
the
people
for
ladronism
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
stamp
out
the
disease
batangas
was
only
disturbed
by
reason
of
the
fugitive
ladrones
from
cavite
samar
was
thrown
into
disturbance
by
the
uneducated
and
partly
savage
peoples
living
in
the
mountains
who
having
been
given
by
the
municipal
code
more
power
than
they
were
able
to
exercise
discreetly
elected
municipal
officers
who
abused
their
trusts
compelled
the
people
raising
hemp
to
sell
it
at
a
much
less
price
than
it
was
worth
and
by
their
abuses
drove
their
people
into
resistance
to
constituted
authority
cavite
and
samar
are
instances
of
reposing
too
much
confidence
in
the
selfgoverning
power
of
a
people
the
disturbances
have
all
now
been
suppressed
and
it
is
hoped
that
with
these
lessons
local
governments
can
be
formed
which
will
secure
quiet
and
peace
to
the
deserving
inhabitants
the
incident
is
another
proof
of
the
fact
that
if
there
has
been
any
error
as
regards
giving
selfgovernment
in
the
philippines
it
has
been
in
the
direction
of
giving
it
too
quickly
not
too
slowly
a
year
from
next
april
the
first
legislative
assembly
for
the
islands
will
be
held
on
the
sanity
and
selfrestraint
of
this
body
much
will
depend
so
far
as
the
future
selfgovernment
of
the
islands
is
concerned
the
most
encouraging
feature
of
the
whole
situation
has
been
the
very
great
interest
taken
by
the
common
people
in
education
and
the
great
increase
in
the
number
of
enrolled
students
in
the
public
schools
the
increase
was
from
to
half
a
million
pupils
the
average
attendance
is
about
per
cent
the
only
limit
upon
the
number
of
pupils
seems
to
be
the
capacity
of
the
government
to
furnish
teachers
and
school
houses
the
agricultural
conditions
of
the
islands
enforce
more
strongly
than
ever
the
argument
in
favor
of
reducing
the
tariff
on
the
products
of
the
philippine
islands
entering
the
united
states
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
tariff
now
imposed
by
the
dingley
bill
upon
the
products
of
the
philippine
islands
be
entirely
removed
except
the
tariff
on
sugar
and
tobacco
and
that
that
tariff
be
reduced
to
per
cent
of
the
present
rates
under
the
dingley
act
that
after
july
the
tariff
upon
tobacco
and
sugar
produced
in
the
philippine
islands
be
entirely
removed
and
that
free
trade
between
the
islands
and
the
united
states
in
the
products
of
each
country
then
be
provided
for
by
law
a
statute
in
force
enacted
april
suspends
the
operation
of
the
coastwise
laws
of
the
united
states
upon
the
trade
between
the
philippine
islands
and
the
united
states
until
july
i
earnestly
recommend
that
this
suspension
be
postponed
until
july
i
think
it
of
doubtful
utility
to
apply
the
coastwise
laws
to
the
trade
between
the
united
states
and
the
philippines
under
any
circumstances
because
i
am
convinced
that
it
will
do
no
good
whatever
to
american
bottoms
and
will
only
interfere
and
be
an
obstacle
to
the
trade
between
the
philippines
and
the
united
states
but
if
the
coastwise
law
must
be
thus
applied
certainly
it
ought
not
to
have
effect
until
free
trade
is
enjoyed
between
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
in
their
respective
products
i
do
not
anticipate
that
free
trade
between
the
islands
and
the
united
states
will
produce
a
revolution
in
the
sugar
and
tobacco
production
of
the
philippine
islands
so
primitive
are
the
methods
of
agriculture
in
the
philippine
islands
so
slow
is
capital
in
going
to
the
islands
so
many
difficulties
surround
a
large
agricultural
enterprise
in
the
islands
that
it
will
be
many
many
years
before
the
products
of
those
islands
will
have
any
effect
whatever
upon
the
markets
of
the
united
states
the
problem
of
labor
is
also
a
formidable
one
with
the
sugar
and
tobacco
producers
in
the
islands
the
best
friends
of
the
filipino
people
and
the
people
themselves
are
utterly
opposed
to
the
admission
of
chinese
coolie
labor
hence
the
only
solution
is
the
training
of
filipino
labor
and
this
will
take
a
long
time
the
enactment
of
a
law
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
making
provision
for
free
trade
between
the
islands
and
the
united
states
however
will
be
of
great
importance
from
a
political
and
sentimental
standpoint
and
while
its
actual
benefit
has
doubtless
been
exaggerated
by
the
people
of
the
islands
they
will
accept
this
measure
of
justice
as
an
indication
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
anxious
to
aid
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
in
every
way
and
especially
in
the
agricultural
development
of
their
archipelago
it
will
aid
the
filipinos
without
injuring
interests
in
america
in
my
judgment
immediate
steps
should
be
taken
for
the
fortification
of
hawaii
this
is
the
most
important
point
in
the
pacific
to
fortify
in
order
to
conserve
the
interests
of
this
country
it
would
be
hard
to
overstate
the
importance
of
this
need
hawaii
is
too
heavily
taxed
laws
should
be
enacted
setting
aside
for
a
period
of
say
twenty
years
per
cent
of
the
internal
revenue
and
customs
receipts
from
hawaii
as
a
special
fund
to
be
expended
in
the
islands
for
educational
and
public
buildings
and
for
harbor
improvements
and
military
and
naval
defenses
it
cannot
b
e
too
often
repeated
that
our
aim
must
be
to
develop
the
territory
of
hawaii
on
traditional
american
lines
that
territory
has
serious
commercial
and
industrial
problems
to
reckon
with
but
no
measure
of
relief
can
be
considered
which
looks
to
legislation
admitting
chinese
and
restricting
them
by
statute
to
field
labor
and
domestic
service
the
status
of
servility
can
never
again
be
tolerated
on
american
soil
we
cannot
concede
that
the
proper
solution
of
its
problems
is
special
legislation
admitting
to
hawaii
a
class
of
laborers
denied
admission
to
the
other
states
and
territories
there
are
obstacles
and
great
obstacles
in
the
way
of
building
up
a
representative
american
community
in
the
hawaiian
islands
but
it
is
not
in
the
american
character
to
give
up
in
the
face
of
difficulty
many
an
american
commonwealth
has
been
built
up
against
odds
equal
to
those
that
now
confront
hawaii
no
merely
halfhearted
effort
to
meet
its
problems
as
other
american
communities
have
met
theirs
can
be
accepted
as
final
hawaii
shall
never
become
a
territory
in
which
a
governing
class
of
rich
planters
exists
by
means
of
coolie
labor
even
if
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
territory
is
thereby
rendered
slower
the
growth
must
only
take
place
by
the
admission
of
immigrants
fit
in
the
end
to
assume
the
duties
and
burdens
of
full
american
citizenship
our
aim
must
be
to
develop
the
territory
on
the
same
basis
of
stable
citizenship
as
exists
on
this
continent
i
earnestly
advocate
the
adoption
of
legislation
which
will
explicitly
confer
american
citizenship
on
all
citizens
of
porto
rico
there
is
in
my
judgment
no
excuse
for
failure
to
do
this
the
harbor
of
san
juan
should
be
dredged
and
improved
the
expenses
of
the
federal
court
of
porto
rico
should
be
met
from
the
federal
treasury
and
not
from
the
porto
rican
treasury
the
elections
in
porto
rico
should
take
place
every
four
years
and
the
legislature
should
meet
in
session
every
two
years
the
present
form
of
government
in
porto
rico
which
provides
for
the
appointment
by
the
president
of
the
members
of
the
executive
council
or
upper
house
of
the
legislature
has
proved
satisfactory
and
has
inspired
confidence
in
property
owners
and
investors
i
do
not
deem
it
advisable
at
the
present
time
to
change
this
form
in
any
material
feature
the
problems
and
needs
of
the
island
are
industrial
and
commercial
rather
than
political
i
wish
to
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
one
question
which
affects
our
insular
possessions
generally
namely
the
need
of
an
increased
liberality
in
the
treatment
of
the
whole
franchise
question
in
these
islands
in
the
proper
desire
to
prevent
the
islands
being
exploited
by
speculators
and
to
have
them
develop
in
the
interests
of
their
own
people
an
error
has
been
made
in
refusing
to
grant
sufficiently
liberal
terms
to
induce
the
investment
of
american
capital
in
the
philippines
and
in
porto
rico
elsewhere
in
this
message
i
have
spoken
strongly
against
the
jealousy
of
mere
wealth
and
especially
of
corporate
wealth
as
such
but
it
is
particularly
regrettable
to
allow
any
such
jealousy
to
be
developed
when
we
are
dealing
either
with
our
insular
or
with
foreign
affairs
the
big
corporation
has
achieved
its
present
position
in
the
business
world
simply
because
it
is
the
most
effective
instrument
in
business
competition
in
foreign
affairs
we
cannot
afford
to
put
our
people
at
a
disadvantage
with
their
competitors
by
in
any
way
discriminating
against
the
efficiency
of
our
business
organizations
in
the
same
way
we
cannot
afford
to
allow
our
insular
possessions
to
lag
behind
in
industrial
development
from
any
twisted
jealousy
of
business
success
it
is
of
course
a
mere
truism
to
say
that
the
business
interests
of
the
islands
will
only
be
developed
if
it
becomes
the
financial
interest
of
somebody
to
develop
them
yet
this
development
is
one
of
the
things
most
earnestly
to
be
wished
for
in
the
interest
of
the
islands
themselves
we
have
been
paying
all
possible
heed
to
the
political
and
educational
interests
of
the
islands
but
important
though
these
objects
are
it
is
not
less
important
that
we
should
favor
their
industrial
development
the
government
can
in
certain
ways
help
this
directly
as
by
building
good
roads
but
the
fundamental
and
vital
help
must
be
given
through
the
development
of
the
industries
of
the
islands
and
a
most
efficient
means
to
this
end
is
to
encourage
big
american
corporations
to
start
industries
in
them
and
this
means
to
make
it
advantageous
for
them
to
do
so
to
limit
the
ownership
of
mining
claims
as
has
been
done
in
the
philippines
is
absurd
in
both
the
philippines
and
porto
rico
the
limit
of
holdings
of
land
should
be
largely
raised
i
earnestly
ask
that
alaska
be
given
an
elective
delegate
some
person
should
be
chosen
who
can
speak
with
authority
of
the
needs
of
the
territory
the
government
should
aid
in
the
construction
of
a
railroad
from
the
gulf
of
alaska
to
the
yukon
river
in
american
territory
in
my
last
two
messages
i
advocated
certain
additional
action
on
behalf
of
alaska
i
shall
not
now
repeat
those
recommendations
but
i
shall
lay
all
my
stress
upon
the
one
recommendation
of
giving
to
alaska
some
one
authorized
to
speak
for
it
i
should
prefer
that
the
delegate
was
made
elective
but
if
this
is
not
deemed
wise
then
make
him
appointive
at
any
rate
give
alaska
some
person
whose
business
it
shall
be
to
speak
with
authority
on
her
behalf
to
the
congress
the
natural
resources
of
alaska
are
great
some
of
the
chief
needs
of
the
peculiarly
energetic
selfreliant
and
typically
american
white
population
of
alaska
were
set
forth
in
my
last
message
i
also
earnestly
ask
your
attention
to
the
needs
of
the
alaskan
indians
all
indians
who
are
competent
should
receive
the
full
rights
of
american
citizenship
it
is
for
instance
a
gross
and
indefensible
wrong
to
deny
to
such
hardworking
decentliving
indians
as
the
metlakahtlas
the
right
to
obtain
licenses
as
captains
pilots
and
engineers
the
right
to
enter
mining
claims
and
to
profit
by
the
homestead
law
these
particular
indians
are
civilized
and
are
competent
and
entitled
to
be
put
on
the
same
basis
with
the
white
men
round
about
them
i
recommend
that
indian
territory
and
oklahoma
be
admitted
as
one
state
and
that
new
mexico
and
arizona
be
admitted
as
one
state
there
is
no
obligation
upon
us
to
treat
territorial
subdivisions
which
are
matters
of
convenience
only
as
binding
us
on
the
question
of
admission
to
statehood
nothing
has
taken
up
more
time
in
the
congress
during
the
past
few
years
than
the
question
as
to
the
statehood
to
be
granted
to
the
four
territories
above
mentioned
and
after
careful
consideration
of
all
that
has
been
developed
in
the
discussions
of
the
question
i
recommend
that
they
be
immediately
admitted
as
two
states
there
is
no
justification
for
further
delay
and
the
advisability
of
making
the
four
territories
into
two
states
has
been
clearly
established
in
some
of
the
territories
the
legislative
assemblies
issue
licenses
for
gambling
the
congress
should
by
law
forbid
this
practice
the
harmful
results
of
which
are
obvious
at
a
glance
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
panama
under
which
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
was
made
possible
went
into
effect
with
its
ratification
by
the
united
states
senate
on
february
the
canal
properties
of
the
french
canal
company
were
transferred
to
the

on

on

during

two
points
about

have
ceased

be

to
debate

the
question

the

be

the
question
of
feasibility
there
are
no
physical
obstacles
on
this
route
that
american
engineering
skill
will
not
be
able
to
overcome
without
serious
difficulty
or
that
will
prevent
the
completion
of
the
canal
within
a
reasonable
time
and
at
a
reasonable
cost
this
is
virtually
the
unanimous
testimony
of
the
engineers
who
have
investigated
the
matter
for
the
government
the
point
which
remains
unsettled
is
the
question
of
type
whether
the
canal
shall
be
one
of
several
locks
above
sea
level
or
at
sea
level
with
a
single
tide
lock
on
this
point
i
hope
to
lay
before
the
congress
at
an
early
day
the
findings
of
the
advisory
board
of
american
and
european
engineers
that
at
my
invitation
have
been
considering
the
subject
together
with
the
report
of
the
commission
thereon
and
such
comments
thereon
or
recommendations
in
reference
thereto
as
may
seem
necessary
the
american
people
is
pledged
to
the
speediest
possible
construction
of
a
canal
adequate
to
meet
the
demands
which
the
commerce
of
the
world
will
make
upon
it
and
i
appeal
most
earnestly
to
the
congress
to
aid
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
pledge
gratifying
progress
has
been
made
during
the
past
year
and
especially
during
the
past
four
months
the
greater
part
of
the
necessary
preliminary
work
has
been
done
actual
work
of
excavation
could
be
begun
only
on
a
limited
scale
till
the
canal
zone
was
made
a
healthful
place
to
live
in
and
to
work
in
the
isthmus
had
to
be
sanitated
first
this
task
has
been
so
thoroughly
accomplished
that
yellow
fever
has
been
virtually
extirpated
from
the
isthmus
and
general
health
conditions
vastly
improved
the
same
methods
which
converted
the
island
of
cuba
from
a
pest
hole
which
menaced
the
health
of
the
world
into
a
healthful
place
of
abode
have
been
applied
on
the
isthmus
with
satisfactory
results
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
when
the
plans
for
water
supply
paving
and
sewerage
of
panama
and
colon
and
the
large
labor
camps
have
been
fully
carried
out
the
isthmus
will
be
for
the
tropics
an
unusually
healthy
place
of
abode
the
work
is
so
far
advanced
now
that
the
he
alth
of
all
those
employed
in
canal
work
is
as
well
guarded
as
it
is
on
similar
work
in
this
country
and
elsewhere
in
addition
to
sanitating
the
isthmus
satisfactory
quarters
are
being
provided
for
employes
and
an
adequate
system
of
supplying
them
with
wholesome
food
at
reasonable
prices
has
been
created
hospitals
have
been
established
and
equipped
that
are
without
their
superiors
of
their
kind
anywhere
the
country
has
thus
been
made
fit
to
work
in
and
provision
has
been
made
for
the
welfare
and
comfort
of
those
who
are
to
do
the
work
during
the
past
year
a
large
portion
of
the
plant
with
which
the
work
is
to
be
done
has
been
ordered
it
is
confidently
believed
that
by
the
middle
of
the
approaching
year
a
sufficient
proportion
of
this
plant
will
have
been
installed
to
enable
us
to
resume
the
work
of
excavation
on
a
large
scale
what
is
needed
now
and
without
delay
is
an
appropriation
by
the
congress
to
meet
the
current
and
accruing
expenses
of
the
commission
the
first
appropriation
of
out
of
the
authorized
by
the
spooner
act
was
made
three
years
ago
it
is
nearly
exhausted
there
is
barely
enough
of
it
remaining
to
carry
the
commission
to
the
end
of
the
year
unless
the
congress
shall
appropriate
before
that
time
all
work
must
cease
to
arrest
progress
for
any
length
of
time
now
when
matters
are
advancing
so
satisfactorily
would
be
deplorable
there
will
be
no
money
with
which
to
meet
pay
roll
obligations
and
none
with
which
to
meet
bills
coming
due
for
materials
and
supplies
and
there
will
be
demoralization
of
the
forces
here
and
on
the
isthmus
now
working
so
harmoniously
and
effectively
if
there
is
delay
in
granting
an
emergency
appropriation
estimates
of
the
amount
necessary
will
be
found
in
the
accompanying
reports
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
commission
i
recommend
more
adequate
provision
than
has
been
made
heretofore
for
the
work
of
the
department
of
state
within
a
few
years
there
has
been
a
very
great
increase
in
the
amount
and
importance
of
the
work
to
be
done
by
that
department
both
in
washington
and
abroad
this
has
been
caused
by
the
great
increase
of
our
foreign
trade
the
increase
of
wealth
among
our
people
which
enables
them
to
travel
more
generally
than
heretofore
the
increase
of
american
capital
which
is
seeking
investment
in
foreign
countries
and
the
growth
of
our
power
and
weight
in
the
councils
of
the
civilized
world
there
has
been
no
corresponding
increase
of
facilities
for
doing
the
work
afforded
to
the
department
having
charge
of
our
foreign
relations
neither
at
home
nor
abroad
is
there
a
sufficient
working
force
to
do
the
business
properly
in
many
respects
the
system
which
was
adequate
to
the
work
of
twentyfive
years
or
even
ten
years
ago
is
inadequate
now
and
should
be
changed
our
consular
force
should
be
classified
and
appointments
should
be
made
to
the
several
classes
with
authority
to
the
executive
to
assign
the
members
of
each
class
to
duty
at
such
posts
as
the
interests
of
the
service
require
instead
of
the
appointments
being
made
as
at
present
to
specified
posts
there
should
be
an
adequate
inspection
service
so
that
the
department
may
be
able
to
inform
itself
how
the
business
of
each
consulate
is
being
done
instead
of
depending
upon
casual
private
information
or
rumor
the
fee
system
should
be
entirely
abolished
and
a
due
equivalent
made
in
salary
to
the
officers
who
now
eke
out
their
subsistence
by
means
of
fees
sufficient
provision
should
be
made
for
a
clerical
force
in
every
consulate
composed
entirely
of
americans
instead
of
the
insufficient
provision
now
made
which
compels
the
employment
of
great
numbers
of
citizens
of
foreign
countries
whose
services
can
be
obtained
for
less
money
at
a
large
part
of
our
consulates
the
office
quarters
and
the
clerical
force
are
inadequate
to
the
performance
of
the
onerous
duties
imposed
by
the
recent
provisions
of
our
immigration
laws
as
well
as
by
our
increasing
trade
in
many
parts
of
the
world
the
lack
of
suitable
quarters
for
our
embassies
legations
and
consulates
detracts
from
the
respect
in
which
our
officers
ought
to
be
held
and
seriously
impairs
their
weight
and
influence
suitable
provision
should
be
made
for
the
expense
of
keeping
our
diplomatic
officers
more
fully
informed
of
what
is
being
done
from
day
to
day
in
the
progress
of
our
diplomatic
affairs
with
other
countries
the
lack
of
such
information
caused
by
insufficient
appropriations
available
for
cable
tolls
and
for
clerical
and
messenger
service
frequently
puts
our
officers
at
a
great
disadvantage
and
detracts
from
their
usefulness
the
salary
list
should
be
readjusted
it
does
not
now
correspond
either
to
the
importance
of
the
service
to
be
rendered
and
the
degrees
of
ability
and
experience
required
in
the
different
positions
or
to
the
differences
in
the
cost
of
living
in
many
cases
the
salaries
are
quite
inadequate

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
nation
continues
to
enjoy
noteworthy
prosperity
such
prosperity
is
of
course
primarily
due
to
the
high
individual
average
of
our
citizenship
taken
together
with
our
great
natural
resources
but
an
important
factor
therein
is
the
working
of
our
longcontinued
governmental
policies
the
people
have
emphatically
expressed
their
approval
of
the
principles
underlying
these
policies
and
their
desire
that
these
principles
be
kept
substantially
unchanged
although
of
course
applied
in
a
progressive
spirit
to
meet
changing
conditions
the
enlargement
of
scope
of
the
functions
of
the
national
government
required
by
our
development
as
a
nation
involves
of
course
increase
of
expense
and
the
period
of
prosperity
through
which
the
country
is
passing
justifies
expenditures
for
permanent
improvements
far
greater
than
would
be
wise
in
hard
times
battle
ships
and
forts
public
buildings
and
improved
waterways
are
investments
which
should
be
made
when
we
have
the
money
but
abundant
revenues
and
a
large
surplus
always
invite
extravagance
and
constant
care
should
be
taken
to
guard
against
unnecessary
increase
of
the
ordinary
expenses
of
government
the
cost
of
doing
government
business
should
be
regulated
with
the
same
rigid
scrutiny
as
the
cost
of
doing
a
private
business
in
the
vast
and
complicated
mechanism
of
our
modern
civilized
life
the
dominant
note
is
the
note
of
industrialism
and
the
relations
of
capital
and
labor
and
especially
of
organized
capital
and
organized
labor
to
each
other
and
to
the
public
at
large
come
second
in
importance
only
to
the
intimate
questions
of
family
life
our
peculiar
form
of
government
with
its
sharp
division
of
authority
between
the
nation
and
the
several
states
has
been
on
the
whole
far
more
advantageous
to
our
development
than
a
more
strongly
centralized
government
but
it
is
undoubtedly
responsible
for
much
of
the
difficulty
of
meeting
with
adequate
legislation
the
new
problems
presented
by
the
total
change
in
industrial
conditions
on
this
continent
during
the
last
half
century
in
actual
practice
it
has
proved
exceedingly
difficult
and
in
many
cases
impossible
to
get
unanimity
of
wise
action
among
the
various
states
on
these
subjects
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
this
is
especially
true
of
the
laws
affecting
the
employment
of
capital
in
huge
masses
with
regard
to
labor
the
problem
is
no
less
important
but
it
is
simpler
as
long
as
the
states
retain
the
primary
control
of
the
police
power
the
circumstances
must
be
altogether
extreme
which
require
interference
by
the
federal
authorities
whether
in
the
way
of
safeguarding
the
rights
of
labor
or
in
the
way
of
seeing
that
wrong
is
not
done
by
unruly
persons
who
shield
themselves
behind
the
name
of
labor
if
there
is
resistance
to
the
federal
courts
interference
with
the
mails
or
interstate
commerce
or
molestation
of
federal
property
or
if
the
state
authorities
in
some
crisis
which
they
are
unable
to
face
call
for
help
then
the
federal
government
may
interfere
but
though
such
interference
may
be
caused
by
a
condition
of
things
arising
out
of
trouble
connected
with
some
question
of
labor
the
interference
itself
simply
takes
the
form
of
restoring
order
without
regard
to
the
questions
which
have
caused
the
breach
of
orderfor
to
keep
order
is
a
primary
duty
and
in
a
time
of
disorder
and
violence
all
other
questions
sink
into
abeyance
until
order
has
been
restored
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
territories
the
federal
law
covers
the
entire
field
of
government
but
the
labor
question
is
only
acute
in
populous
centers
of
commerce
manufactures
or
mining
nevertheless
both
in
the
enactment
and
in
the
enforcement
of
law
the
federal
government
within
its
restricted
sphere
should
set
an
example
to
the
state
governments
especially
in
a
matter
so
vital
as
this
affecting
labor
i
believe
that
under
modern
industrial
conditions
it
is
often
necessary
and
even
where
not
necessary
it
is
yet
often
wise
that
there
should
be
organization
of
labor
in
order
better
to
secure
the
rights
of
the
individual
wageworker
all
encouragement
should
be
given
to
any
such
organization
so
long
as
it
is
conducted
with
a
due
and
decent
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
there
are
in
this
country
some
labor
unions
which
have
habitually
and
other
labor
unions
which
have
often
been
among
the
most
effective
agents
in
working
for
good
citizenship
and
for
uplifting
the
condition
of
those
whose
welfare
should
be
closest
to
our
hearts
but
when
any
labor
union
seeks
improper
ends
or
seeks
to
achieve
proper
ends
by
improper
means
all
good
citizens
and
more
especially
all
honorable
public
servants
must
oppose
the
wrongdoing
as
resolutely
as
they
would
oppose
the
wrongdoing
of
any
great
corporation
of
course
any
violence
brutality
or
corruption
should
not
for
one
moment
be
tolerated
wageworkers
have
an
entire
right
to
organize
and
by
all
peaceful
and
honorable
means
to
endeavor
to
persuade
their
fellows
to
join
with
them
in
organizations
they
have
a
legal
right
which
according
to
circumstances
may
or
may
not
be
a
moral
right
to
refuse
to
work
in
company
with
men
who
decline
to
join
their
organizations
they
have
under
no
circumstances
the
right
to
commit
violence
upon
these
whether
capitalists
or
wageworkers
who
refuse
to
support
their
organizations
or
who
side
with
those
with
whom
they
are
at
odds
for
mob
rule
is
intolerable
in
any
form
the
wageworkers
are
peculiarly
entitled
to
the
protection
and
the
encouragement
of
the
law
from
the
very
nature
of
their
occupation
railroad
men
for
instance
are
liable
to
be
maimed
in
doing
the
legitimate
work
of
their
profession
unless
the
railroad
companies
are
required
by
law
to
make
ample
provision
for
their
safety
the
administration
has
been
zealous
in
enforcing
the
existing
law
for
this
purpose
that
law
should
be
amended
and
strengthened
wherever
the
national
government
has
power
there
should
be
a
stringent
employers
liability
law
which
should
apply
to
the
government
itself
where
the
government
is
an
employer
of
labor
in
my
message
to
the
fiftyseventh
congress
at
its
second
session
i
urged
the
passage
of
an
employers
liability
law
for
the
district
of
columbia
i
now
renew
that
recommendation
and
further
recommend
that
the
congress
appoint
a
commission
to
make
a
comprehensive
study
of
employers
liability
with
the
view
of
extending
the
provisions
of
a
great
and
constitutional
law
to
all
employments
within
the
scope
of
federal
power
the
government
has
recognized
heroism
upon
the
water
and
bestows
medals
of
honor
upon
those
persons
who
by
extreme
and
heroic
daring
have
endangered
their
lives
in
saving
or
endeavoring
to
save
lives
from
the
perils
of
the
sea
in
the
waters
over
which
the
united
states
has
jurisdiction
or
upon
an
american
vessel
this
recognition
should
be
extended
to
cover
cases
of
conspicuous
bravery
and
selfsacrifice
in
the
saving
of
life
in
private
employments
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
particularly
in
the
land
commerce
of
the
nation
the
everincreasing
casualty
list
upon
our
railroads
is
a
matter
of
grave
public
concern
and
urgently
calls
for
action
by
the
congress
in
the
matter
of
speed
and
comfort
of
railway
travel
our
railroads
give
at
least
as
good
service
as
those
of
any
other
nation
and
there
is
no
reason
why
this
service
should
not
also
be
as
safe
as
human
ingenuity
can
make
it
many
of
our
leading
roads
have
been
foremost
in
the
adoption
of
the
most
approved
safeguards
for
the
protection
of
travelers
and
employees
yet
the
list
of
clearly
avoidable
accidents
continues
unduly
large
the
passage
of
a
law
requiring
the
adoption
of
a
blocksignal
system
has
been
proposed
to
the
congress
i
earnestly
concur
in
that
recommendation
and
would
also
point
out
to
the
congress
the
urgent
need
of
legislation
in
the
interest
of
the
public
safety
limiting
the
hours
of
labor
for
railroad
employees
in
train
service
upon
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
providing
that
only
trained
and
experienced
persons
be
employed
in
positions
of
responsibility
connected
with
the
operation
of
trains
of
course
nothing
can
ever
prevent
accidents
caused
by
human
weakness
or
misconduct
and
there
should
be
drastic
punishment
for
any
railroad
employee
whether
officer
or
man
who
by
issuance
of
wrong
orders
or
by
disobedience
of
orders
causes
disaster
the
law
of
requiring
interstate
railroads
to
make
monthly
reports
of
all
accidents
to
passengers
and
employees
on
duty
should
also
be
amended
so
as
to
empower
the
government
to
make
a
personal
investigation
through
proper
officers
of
all
accidents
involving
loss
of
life
which
seem
to
require
investigation
with
a
requirement
that
the
results
of
such
investigation
be
made
public
the
safetyappliance
law
as
amended
by
the
act
of
march
has
proved
beneficial
to
railway
employees
and
in
order
that
its
provisions
may
be
properly
carried
out
the
force
of
inspectors
provided
for
by
appropriation
should
be
largely
increased
this
service
is
analogous
to
the
steamboatinspection
service
and
deals
with
even
more
important
interests
it
has
passed
the
experimental
stage
and
demonstrated
its
utility
and
should
receive
generous
recognition
by
the
congress
there
is
no
objection
to
employees
of
the
government
forming
or
belonging
to
unions
but
the
government
can
neither
discriminate
for
nor
discriminate
against
nonunion
men
who
are
in
its
employment
or
who
seek
to
be
employed
under
it
moreover
it
is
a
very
grave
impropriety
for
government
employees
to
band
themselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
extorting
improperly
high
salaries
from
the
government
especially
is
this
true
of
those
within
the
classified
service
the
letter
carriers
both
municipal
and
rural
are
as
a
whole
an
excellent
body
of
public
servants
they
should
be
amply
paid
but
their
payment
must
be
obtained
by
arguing
their
claims
fairly
and
honorably
before
the
congress
and
not
by
banding
together
for
the
defeat
of
those
congressmen
who
refuse
to
give
promises
which
they
can
not
in
conscience
give
the
administration
has
alread
y
taken
steps
to
prevent
and
punish
abuses
of
this
nature
but
it
will
be
wise
for
the
congress
to
supplement
this
action
by
legislation
much
can
be
done
by
the
government
in
labor
matters
merely
by
giving
publicity
to
certain
conditions
the
bureau
of
labor
has
done
excellent
work
of
this
kind
in
many
different
directions
i
shall
shortly
lay
before
you
in
a
special
message
the
full
report
of
the
investigation
of
the
bureau
of
labor
into
the
colorado
mining
strike
as
this
was
a
strike
in
which
certain
very
evil
forces
which
are
more
or
less
at
work
everywhere
under
the
conditions
of
modern
industrialism
became
startlingly
prominent
it
is
greatly
to
be
wished
that
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
through
the
labor
bureau
should
compile
and
arrange
for
the
congress
a
list
of
the
labor
laws
of
the
various
states
and
should
be
given
the
means
to
investigate
and
report
to
the
congress
upon
the
labor
conditions
in
the
manufacturing
and
mining
regions
throughout
the
country
both
as
to
wages
as
to
hours
of
labor
as
to
the
labor
of
women
and
children
and
as
to
the
effect
in
the
various
labor
centers
of
immigration
from
abroad
in
this
investigation
especial
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
conditions
of
child
labor
and
childlabor
legislation
in
the
several
states
such
an
investigation
must
necessarily
take
into
account
many
of
the
problems
with
which
this
question
of
child
labor
is
connected
these
problems
can
be
actually
met
in
most
cases
only
by
the
states
themselves
but
the
lack
of
proper
legislation
in
one
state
in
such
a
matter
as
child
labor
often
renders
it
excessively
difficult
to
establish
protective
restriction
upon
the
work
in
another
state
having
the
same
industries
so
that
the
worst
tends
to
drag
down
the
better
for
this
reason
it
would
be
well
for
the
nation
at
least
to
endeavor
to
secure
comprehensive
information
as
to
the
conditions
of
labor
of
children
in
the
different
states
such
investigation
and
publication
by
the
national
government
would
tend
toward
the
securing
of
approximately
uniform
legislation
of
the
proper
character
among
the
several
states
when
we
come
to
deal
with
great
corporations
the
need
for
the
government
to
act
directly
is
far
greater
than
in
the
case
of
labor
because
great
corporations
can
become
such
only
by
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
is
peculiarly
the
field
of
the
general
government
it
is
an
absurdity
to
expect
to
eliminate
the
abuses
in
great
corporations
by
state
action
it
is
difficult
to
be
patient
with
an
argument
that
such
matters
should
be
left
to
the
states
because
more
than
one
state
pursues
the
policy
of
creating
on
easy
terms
corporations
which
are
never
operated
within
that
state
at
all
but
in
other
states
whose
laws
they
ignore
the
national
government
alone
can
deal
adequately
with
these
great
corporations
to
try
to
deal
with
them
in
an
intemperate
destructive
or
demagogic
spirit
would
in
all
probability
mean
that
nothing
whatever
would
be
accomplished
and
with
absolute
certainty
that
if
anything
were
accomplished
it
would
be
of
a
harmful
nature
the
american
people
need
to
continue
to
show
the
very
qualities
that
they
have
shownthat
is
moderation
good
sense
the
earnest
desire
to
avoid
doing
any
damage
and
yet
the
quiet
determination
to
proceed
step
by
step
without
halt
and
without
hurry
in
eliminating
or
at
least
in
minimizing
whatever
of
mischief
or
evil
there
is
to
interstate
commerce
in
the
conduct
of
great
corporations
they
are
acting
in
no
spirit
of
hostility
to
wealth
either
individual
or
corporate
they
are
not
against
the
rich
man
any
more
than
against
the
poor
man
on
the
contrary
they
are
friendly
alike
toward
rich
man
and
toward
poor
man
provided
only
that
each
acts
in
a
spirit
of
justice
and
decency
toward
his
fellows
great
corporations
are
necessary
and
only
men
of
great
and
singular
mental
power
can
manage
such
corporations
successfully
and
such
men
must
have
great
rewards
but
these
corporations
should
be
managed
with
due
regard
to
the
interest
of
the
public
as
a
whole
where
this
can
be
done
under
the
present
laws
it
must
be
done
where
these
laws
come
short
others
should
be
enacted
to
supplement
them
yet
we
must
never
forget
the
determining
factor
in
every
kind
of
work
of
head
or
hand
must
be
the
mans
own
good
sense
courage
and
kindliness
more
important
than
any
legislation
is
the
gradual
growth
of
a
feeling
of
responsibility
and
forbearance
among
capitalists
and
wageworkers
alike
a
feeling
of
respect
on
the
part
of
each
man
for
the
rights
of
others
a
feeling
of
broad
community
of
interest
not
merely
of
capitalists
among
themselves
and
of
wageworkers
among
themselves
but
of
capitalists
and
wageworkers
in
their
relations
to
each
other
and
of
both
in
their
relations
to
their
fellows
who
with
them
make
up
the
body
politic
there
are
many
captains
of
industry
many
labor
leaders
who
realize
this
a
recent
speech
by
the
president
of
one
of
our
great
railroad
systems
to
the
employees
of
that
system
contains
sound
common
sense
it
rims
in
part
as
follows
it
is
my
belief
we
can
better
serve
each
other
better
understand
the
man
as
well
as
his
business
when
meeting
face
to
face
exchanging
views
and
realizing
from
personal
contact
we
serve
but
one
interest
that
of
our
mutual
prosperity
serious
misunderstandings
can
not
occur
where
personal
good
will
exists
and
opportunity
for
personal
explanation
is
present
in
my
early
business
life
i
had
experience
with
men
of
affairs
of
a
character
to
make
me
desire
to
avoid
creating
a
like
feeling
of
resentment
to
myself
and
the
interests
in
my
charge
should
fortune
ever
place
me
in
authority
and
i
am
solicitous
of
a
measure
of
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
public
and
our
employees
that
i
shall
hope
may
be
warranted
by
the
fairness
and
good
fellowship
i
intend
shall
prevail
in
our
relationship
but
do
not
feel
i
am
disposed
to
grant
unreasonable
requests
spend
the
money
of
our
company
unnecessarily
or
without
value
received
nor
expect
the
days
of
mistakes
are
disappearing
or
that
cause
for
complaint
will
not
continually
occur
simply
to
correct
such
abuses
as
may
be
discovered
to
better
conditions
as
fast
as
reasonably
may
be
expected
constantly
striving
with
varying
success
for
that
improvement
we
all
desire
to
convince
you
there
is
a
force
at
work
in
the
right
direction
all
the
time
making
progressis
the
disposition
with
which
i
have
come
among
you
asking
your
good
will
and
encouragement
the
day
has
gone
by
when
a
corporation
can
be
handled
successfully
in
defiance
of
the
public
will
even
though
that
will
be
unreasonable
and
wrong
a
public
may
be
led
but
not
driven
and
i
prefer
to
go
with
it
and
shape
or
modify
in
a
measure
its
opinion
rather
than
be
swept
from
my
bearings
with
loss
to
myself
and
the
interests
in
my
charge
violent
prejudice
exists
towards
corporate
activity
and
capital
today
much
of
it
founded
in
reason
more
in
apprehension
and
a
large
measure
is
due
to
the
personal
traits
of
arbitrary
unreasonable
incompetent
and
offensive
men
in
positions
of
authority
the
accomplishment
of
results
by
indirection
the
endeavor
to
thwart
the
intention
if
not
the
expressed
letter
of
the
law
the
will
of
the
people
a
disregard
of
the
rights
of
others
a
disposition
to
withhold
what
is
due
to
force
by
main
strength
or
inactivity
a
result
not
justified
depending
upon
the
weakness
of
the
claimant
and
his
indisposition
to
become
involved
in
litigation
has
created
a
sentiment
harmful
in
the
extreme
and
a
disposition
to
consider
anything
fair
that
gives
gain
to
the
individual
at
the
expense
of
the
company
if
corporations
are
to
continue
to
do
the
worlds
work
as
they
are
best
fitted
to
these
qualities
in
their
representatives
that
have
resulted
in
the
present
prejudice
against
them
must
be
relegated
to
the
background
the
corporations
must
come
out
into
the
open
and
see
and
be
seen
they
must
take
the
public
into
their
confidence
and
ask
for
what
they
want
and
no
more
and
be
prepared
to
explain
satisfactorily
what
advantage
will
accrue
to
the
public
if
they
are
given
their
desires
for
they
are
permitted
to
exist
not
that
they
may
make
money
solely
but
that
they
may
effectively
serve
those
from
whom
they
derive
their
power
publicity
and
not
secrecy
will
win
hereafter
and
laws
be
construed
by
their
intent
and
not
by
their
letter
otherwise
public
utilities
will
be
owned
and
operated
by
the
public
which
created
them
even
though
the
service
be
less
efficient
and
the
result
less
satisfactory
from
a
financial
standpoint
the
bureau
of
corporations
has
made
careful
preliminary
investigation
of
many
important
corporations
it
will
make
a
special
report
on
the
beef
industry
the
policy
of
the
bureau
is
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
its
creation
by
cooperation
not
antagonism
by
making
constructive
legislation
not
destructive
prosecution
the
immediate
object
of
its
inquiries
by
conservative
investigation
of
law
and
fact
and
by
refusal
to
issue
incomplete
and
hence
necessarily
inaccurate
reports
its
policy
being
thus
one
of
open
inquiry
into
and
not
attack
upon
business
the
bureau
has
been
able
to
gain
not
only
the
confidence
but
better
still
the
cooperation
of
men
engaged
in
legitimate
business
the
bureau
offers
to
the
congress
the
means
of
getting
at
the
cost
of
production
of
our
various
great
staples
of
commerce
of
necessity
the
careful
investigation
of
special
corporations
will
afford
the
commissioner
knowledge
of
certain
business
facts
the
publication
of
which
might
be
an
improper
infringement
of
private
rights
the
method
of
making
public
the
results
of
these
investigations
affords
under
the
law
a
means
for
the
protection
of
private
rights
the
congress
will
have
all
facts
except
such
as
would
give
to
another
corporation
information
which
would
injure
the
legitimate
business
of
a
competitor
and
destroy
the
incentive
for
individual
superiority
and
thrift
the
bureau
has
also
made
exhaustive
examinations
into
the
legal
condition
under
which
corporate
business
is
carried
on
in
the
various
states
into
all
judicial
decisions
on
the
subj
ect
and
into
the
various
systems
of
corporate
taxation
in
use
i
call
special
attention
to
the
report
of
the
chief
of
the
bureau
and
i
earnestly
ask
that
the
congress
carefully
consider
the
report
and
recommendations
of
the
commissioner
on
this
subject
the
business
of
insurance
vitally
affects
the
great
mass
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
is
national
and
not
local
in
its
application
it
involves
a
multitude
of
transactions
among
the
people
of
the
different
states
and
between
american
companies
and
foreign
governments
i
urge
that
the
congress
carefully
consider
whether
the
power
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
can
not
constitutionally
be
extended
to
cover
interstate
transactions
in
insurance
above
all
else
we
must
strive
to
keep
the
highways
of
commerce
open
to
all
on
equal
terms
and
to
do
this
it
is
necessary
to
put
a
complete
stop
to
all
rebates
whether
the
shipper
or
the
railroad
is
to
blame
makes
no
difference
the
rebate
must
be
stopped
the
abuses
of
the
private
car
and
private
terminaltrack
and
sidetrack
systems
must
be
stopped
and
the
legislation
of
the
fiftyeighth
congress
which
declares
it
to
be
unlawful
for
any
person
or
corporation
to
offer
grant
give
solicit
accept
or
receive
any
rebate
concession
or
discrimination
in
respect
of
the
transportation
of
any
property
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
whereby
such
property
shall
by
any
device
whatever
be
transported
at
a
less
rate
than
that
named
in
the
tariffs
published
by
the
carrier
must
be
enforced
for
some
time
after
the
enactment
of
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
it
remained
a
mooted
question
whether
that
act
conferred
upon
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
power
after
it
had
found
a
challenged
rate
to
be
unreasonable
to
declare
what
thereafter
should
prima
facie
be
the
reasonable
maximum
rate
for
the
transportation
in
dispute
the
supreme
court
finally
resolved
that
question
in
the
negative
so
that
as
the
law
now
stands
the
commission
simply
possess
the
bare
power
to
denounce
a
particular
rate
as
unreasonable
while
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
at
present
it
would
be
undesirable
if
it
were
not
impracticable
finally
to
clothe
the
commission
with
general
authority
to
fix
railroad
rates
i
do
believe
that
as
a
fair
security
to
shippers
the
commission
should
be
vested
with
the
power
where
a
given
rate
has
been
challenged
and
after
full
hearing
found
to
be
unreasonable
to
decide
subject
to
judicial
review
what
shall
be
a
reasonable
rate
to
take
its
place
the
ruling
of
the
commission
to
take
effect
immediately
and
to
obtain
unless
and
until
it
is
reversed
by
the
court
of
review
the
government
must
in
increasing
degree
supervise
and
regulate
the
workings
of
the
railways
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
such
increased
supervision
is
the
only
alternative
to
an
increase
of
the
present
evils
on
the
one
hand
or
a
still
more
radical
policy
on
the
other
in
my
judgment
the
most
important
legislative
act
now
needed
as
regards
the
regulation
of
corporations
is
this
act
to
confer
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
power
to
revise
rates
and
regulations
the
revised
rate
to
at
once
go
into
effect
and
stay
in
effect
unless
and
until
the
court
of
review
reverses
it
steamship
companies
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
protected
in
our
coastwise
trade
should
be
held
to
a
strict
observance
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
pursuing
the
set
plan
to
make
the
city
of
washington
an
example
to
other
american
municipalities
several
points
should
be
kept
in
mind
by
the
legislators
in
the
first
place
the
people
of
this
country
should
clearly
understand
that
no
amount
of
industrial
prosperity
and
above
all
no
leadership
in
international
industrial
competition
can
in
any
way
atone
for
the
sapping
of
the
vitality
of
those
who
are
usually
spoken
of
as
the
working
classes
the
farmers
the
mechanics
the
skilled
and
unskilled
laborers
the
small
shop
keepers
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
population
of
any
country
and
upon
their
wellbeing
generation
after
generation
the
wellbeing
of
the
country
and
the
race
depends
rapid
development
in
wealth
and
industrial
leadership
is
a
good
thing
but
only
if
it
goes
hand
in
hand
with
improvement
and
not
deterioration
physical
and
moral
the
overcrowding
of
cities
and
the
draining
of
country
districts
are
unhealthy
and
even
dangerous
symptoms
in
our
modern
life
we
should
not
permit
overcrowding
in
cities
in
certain
european
cities
it
is
provided
by
law
that
the
population
of
towns
shall
not
be
allowed
to
exceed
a
very
limited
density
for
a
given
area
so
that
the
increase
in
density
must
be
continually
pushed
back
into
a
broad
zone
around
the
center
of
the
town
this
zone
having
great
avenues
or
parks
within
it
the
deathrate
statistics
show
a
terrible
increase
in
mortality
and
especially
in
infant
mortality
in
overcrowded
tenements
the
poorest
families
in
tenement
houses
live
in
one
room
and
it
appears
that
in
these
oneroom
tenements
the
average
death
rate
for
a
number
of
given
cities
at
home
and
abroad
is
about
twice
what
it
is
in
a
tworoom
tenement
four
times
what
it
is
in
a
threeroom
tenement
and
eight
times
what
it
is
in
a
tenement
consisting
of
four
rooms
or
over
these
figures
vary
somewhat
for
different
cities
but
they
approximate
in

those
given
above
and
in
all
cases
the
increase
of
mortality
and
especially
of
infant
mortality
with
the
decrease
in
the
number
of
rooms
used
by
the
family
and
with
the
consequent
overcrowding
is
startling
the
slum
exacts
a
heavy
total
of
death
from
those
who
dwell
therein
and
this
is
the
case
not
merely
in
the
great
crowded
slums
of
high
buildings
in
new
york
and
chicago
but
in
the
alley
slums
of
washington
in
washington
people
can
not
afford
to
ignore
the
harm
that
this
causes
no
christian
and
civilized
community
can
afford
to
show
a
happygolucky
lack
of
concern
for
the
youth
of
today
for
if
so
the
community
will
have
to
pay
a
terrible
penalty
of
financial
burden
and
social
degradation
in
the
tomorrow
there
should
be
severe
childlabor
and
factoryinspection
laws
it
is
very
desirable
that
married
women
should
not
work
in
factories
the
prime
duty
of
the
man
is
to
work
to
be
the
breadwinner
the
prime
duty
of
the
woman
is
to
be
the
mother
the
housewife
all
questions
of
tariff
and
finance
sink
into
utter
insignificance
when
compared
with
the
tremendous
the
vital
importance
of
trying
to
shape
conditions
so
that
these
two
duties
of
the
man
and
of
the
woman
can
be
fulfilled
under
reasonably
favorable
circumstances
if
a
race
does
not
have
plenty
of
children
or
if
the
children
do
not
grow
up
or
if
when
they
grow
up
they
are
unhealthy
in
body
and
stunted
or
vicious
in
mind
then
that
race
is
decadent
and
no
heaping
up
of
wealth
no
splendor
of
momentary
material
prosperity
can
avail
in
any
degree
as
offsets
the
congress
has
the
same
power
of
legislation
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
the
state
legislatures
have
for
the
various
states
the
problems
incident
to
our
highly
complex
modern
industrial
civilization
with
its
manifold
and
perplexing
tendencies
both
for
good
and
for
evil
are
far
less
sharply
accentuated
in
the
city
of
washington
than
in
most
other
cities
for
this
very
reason
it
is
easier
to
deal
with
the
various
phases
of
these
problems
in
washington
and
the
district
of
columbia
government
should
be
a
model
for
the
other
municipal
governments
of
the
nation
in
all
such
matters
as
supervision
of
the
housing
of
the
poor
the
creation
of
small
parks
in
the
districts
inhabited
by
the
poor
in
laws
affecting
labor
in
laws
providing
for
the
taking
care
of
the
children
in
truant
laws
and
in
providing
schools
in
the
vital
matter
of
taking
care
of
children
much
advantage
could
be
gained
by
a
careful
study
of
what
has
been
accomplished
in
such
states
as
illinois
and
colorado
by
the
juvenile
courts
the
work
of
the
juvenile
court
is
really
a
work
of
character
building
it
is
now
generally
recognized
that
young
boys
and
young
girls
who
go
wrong
should
not
be
treated
as
criminals
not
even
necessarily
as
needing
reformation
but
rather
as
needing
to
have
their
characters
formed
and
for
this
end
to
have
them
tested
and
developed
by
a
system
of
probation
much
admirable
work
has
been
done
in
many
of
our
commonwealths
by
earnest
men
and
women
who
have
made
a
special
study
of
the
needs
of
those
classes
of
children
which
furnish
the
greatest
number
of
juvenile
offenders
and
therefore
the
greatest
number
of
adult
offenders
and
by
their
aid
and
by
profiting
by
the
experiences
of
the
different
states
and
cities
in
these
matters
it
would
be
easy
to
provide
a
good
code
for
the
district
of
columbia
several
considerations
suggest
the
need
for
a
systematic
investigation
into
and
improvement
of
housing
conditions
in
washington
the
hidden
residential
alleys
are
breeding
grounds
of
vice
and
disease
and
should
be
opened
into
minor
streets
for
a
number
of
years
influential
citizens
have
joined
with
the
district
commissioners
in
the
vain
endeavor
to
secure
laws
permitting
the
condemnation
of
insanitary
dwellings
the
local
death
rates
especially
from
preventable
diseases
are
so
unduly
high
as
to
suggest
that
the
exceptional
wholesomeness
of
washingtons
better
sections
is
offset
by
bad
conditions
in
her
poorer
neighborhoods
a
special
commission
on
housing
and
health
conditions
in
the
national
capital
would
not
only
bring
about
the
reformation
of
existing
evils
but
would
also
formulate
an
appropriate
building
code
to
protect
the
city
from
mammoth
brick
tenements
and
other
evils
which
threaten
to
develop
here
as
they
have
in
other
cities
that
the
nations
capital
should
be
made
a
model
for
other
municipalities
is
an
ideal
which
appeals
to
all
patriotic
citizens
everywhere
and
such
a
special
commission
might
map
out
and
organize
the
citys
future
development
in
lines
of
civic
social
service
just
as
major
lenfant
and
the
recent
park
commission
planned
the
arrangement
of
her
streets
and
parks
it
is
mortifying
to
remember
that
washington
has
no
compulsory
school
attendance
law
and
that
careful
inquiries
indicate
the
habitual
absence
from
school
of
some
twen
ty
per
cent
of
all
children
between
the
ages
of
eight
and
fourteen
it
must
be
evident
to
all
who
consider
the
problems
of
neglected
child
life
or
the
benefits
of
compulsory
education
in
other
cities
that
one
of
the
most
urgent
needs
of
the
national
capital
is
a
law
requiring
the
school
attendance
of
all
children
this
law
to
be
enforced
by
attendance
agents
directed
by
the
board
of
education
public
play
grounds
are
necessary
means
for
the
development
of
wholesome
citizenship
in
modern
cities
it
is
important
that
the
work
inaugurated
here
through
voluntary
efforts
should
be
taken
up
and
extended
through
congressional
appropriation
of
funds
sufficient
to
equip
and
maintain
numerous
convenient
small
play
grounds
upon
land
which
can
be
secured
without
purchase
or
rental
it
is
also
desirable
that
small
vacant
places
be
purchased
and
reserved
as
smallpark
play
grounds
in
densely
settled
sections
of
the
city
which
now
have
no
public
open
spaces
and
are
destined
soon
to
be
built
up
solidly
all
these
needs
should
be
met
immediately
to
meet
them
would
entail
expenses
but
a
corresponding
saving
could
be
made
by
stopping
the
building
of
streets
and
levelling
of
ground
for
purposes
largely
speculative
in
outlying
parts
of
the
city
there
are
certain
offenders
whose
criminality
takes
the
shape
of
brutality
and
cruelty
towards
the
weak
who
need
a
special
type
of
punishment
the
wifebeater
for
example
is
inadequately
punished
by
imprisonment
for
imprisonment
may
often
mean
nothing
to
him
while
it
may
cause
hunger
and
want
to
the
wife
and
children
who
have
been
the
victims
of
his
brutality
probably
some
form
of
corporal
punishment
would
be
the
most
adequate
way
of
meeting
this
kind
of
crime
the

are
being
made
to
import
from

such

as
are
suitable
to
our
varying

seven
years
ago
we
bought
threefourths
of
our

by
helping
the
rice
growers
on
the
gulf
coast
to
secure
seeds
from
the

by
studying
methods
of

which
have
been
quite
successful
we
are
helping
our

growers
by
importing
varieties
that
ripen
earlier

been
raising
thereby
lengthening
the

season
the
cotton
crop
of
the

is
threatened
with
root
rot
the
bollworm
and
the

weevil
our
pathologists
will
find
immune
varieties
that
will
resist
the
root
disease
and
the
bollworm
can
be
dealt
with
but
the
boll
weevil
is
a
serious
menace
to
the
cotton
crop
it
is
a
central
american
insect
that
has
become
acclimated
in

has
found
the

being
kept
in

by
an
ant
which
has
been
brought
to
our
cotton
fields
for
observation
it
is
hoped
that
it
may
serve
a
good
purpose
the

standpoint
and
interesting

it
will
be
only
a
question
of

will
be
paid
to

it
has
arrangements
with

so
that
our

may
know
as
nearly
as
possible
with
what
they
must
compete
during
the
two
and
a
half
years
that
have
elapsed
since
the
passage
of
the

act
rapid
progress
has
been
made
in
the
surveys
and
examinations
of
the
opportunities
for
reclamation
in
the
thirteen
states
and
three
territories
of
the
arid
west
construction
has
already
been
begun
on
the
largest
and
most
important
of
the
irrigation
works
and
plans
are
being
completed
for
works
which
will
utilize
the
funds
now
available
the
operations
are
being
carried
on
by
the
reclamation
service
a
corps
of
engineers
selected
through
competitive
civilservice
examinations
this
corps
includes
experienced
consulting
and
constructing
engineers
as
well
as
various
experts
in
mechanical
and
legal
matters
and
is
composed
largely
of
men
who
have
spent
most
of
their
lives
in
practical
affairs
connected
with
irrigation
the
larger
problems
have
been
solved
and
it
now
remains
to
execute
with
care
economy
and
thoroughness
the
work
which
has
been
laid
out
all
important
details
are
being
carefully
considered
by
boards
of
consulting
engineers
selected
for
their
thorough
knowledge
and
practical
experience
each
project
is
taken
up
on
the
ground
by
competent
men
and
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
creation
of
prosperous
homes
and
of
promptly
refunding
to
the
treasury
the
cost
of
construction
the
reclamation
act
has
been
found
to
be
remarkably
complete
and
effective
and
so
broad
in
its
provisions
that
a
wide
range
of
undertakings
has
been
possible
under
it
at
the
same
time
economy
is
guaranteed
by
the
fact
that
the
funds
must
ultimately
be
returned
to
be
used
over
again
it
is
the
cardinal
principle
of
the
forestreserve
policy
of
this
administration
that
th
e
reserves
are
for
use
whatever
interferes
with
the
use
of
their
resources
is
to
be
avoided
by
every
possible
means
but
these
resources
must
be
used
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
permanent
the
forest
policy
of
the
government
is
just
now
a
subject
of
vivid
public
interest
throughout
the
west
and
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
general
the
forest
reserves
themselves
are
of
extreme
value
to
the
present
as
well
as
to
the
future
welfare
of
all
the
western
publicland
states
they
powerfully
affect
the
use
and
disposal
of
the
public
lands
they
are
of
special
importance
because
they
preserve
the
water
supply
and
the
supply
of
timber
for
domestic
purposes
and
so
promote
settlement
under
the
reclamation
act
indeed
they
are
essential
to
the
welfare
of
every
one
of
the
great
interests
of
the
west
forest
reserves
are
created
for
two
principal
purposes
the
first
is
to
preserve
the
water
supply
this
is
their
most
important
use
the
principal
users
of
the
water
thus
preserved
are
irrigation
ranchers
and
settlers
cities
and
towns
to
whom
their
municipal
water
supplies
are
of
the
very
first
importance
users
and
furnishers
of
water
power
and
the
users
of
water
for
domestic
manufacturing
mining
and
other
purposes
all
these
are
directly
dependent
upon
the
forest
reserves
the
second
reason
for
which
forest
reserves
are
created
is
to
preserve
the
timber
supply
for
various
classes
of
wood
users
among
the
more
important
of
these
are
settlers
under
the
reclamation
act
and
other
acts
for
whom
a
cheap
and
accessible
supply
of
timber
for
domestic
uses
is
absolutely
necessary
miners
and
prospectors
who
are
in
serious
danger
of
losing
their
timber
supply
by
fire
or
through
export
by
lumber
companies
when
timber
lands
adjacent
to
their
mines
pass
into
private
ownership
lumbermen
transportation
companies
builders
and
commercial
interests
in
general
although
the
wisdom
of
creating
forest
reserves
is
nearly
everywhere
heartily
recognized
yet
in
a
few
localities
there
has
been
misunderstanding
and
complaint
the
following
statement
is
therefore
desirable
the
forest
reserve
policy
can
be
successful
only
when
it
has
the
full
support
of
the
people
of
the
west
it
can
not
safely
and
should
not
in
any
case
be
imposed
upon
them
against
their
will
but
neither
can
we
accept
the
views
of
those
whose
only
interest
in
the
forest
is
temporary
who
are
anxious
to
reap
what
they
have
not
sown
and
then
move
away
leaving
desolation
behind
them
on
the
contrary
it
is
everywhere
and
always
the
interest
of
the
permanent
settler
and
the
permanent
business
man
the
man
with
a
stake
in
the
country
which
must
be
considered
and
which
must
decide
the
making
of
forest
reserves
within
railroad
and
wagonroad
landgrant
limits
will
hereafter
as
for
the
past
three
years
be
so
managed
as
to
prevent
the
issue
under
the
act
of
june
of
base
for
exchange
or
lieu
selection
usually
called
scrip
in
all
cases
where
forest
reserves
within
areas
covered
by
land
grants
appear
to
be
essential
to
the
prosperity
of
settlers
miners
or
others
the
government
lands
within
such
proposed
forest
reserves
will
as
in
the
recent
past
be
withdrawn
from
sale
or
entry
pending
the
completion
of
such
negotiations
with
the
owners
of
the
land
grants
as
will
prevent
the
creation
of
socalled
scrip
it
was
formerly
the
custom
to
make
forest
reserves
without
first
getting
definite
and
detailed
information
as
to
the
character
of
land
and
timber
within
their
boundaries
this
method
of
action
often
resulted
in
badly
chosen
boundaries
and
consequent
injustice
to
settlers
and
others
therefore
this
administration
adopted
the
present
method
of
first
withdrawing
the
land
from
disposal
followed
by
careful
examination
on
the
ground
and
the
preparation
of
detailed
maps
and
descriptions
before
any
forest
reserve
is
created
i
have
repeatedly
called
attention
to
the
confusion
which
exists
in
government
forest
matters
because
the
work
is
scattered
among
three
independent
organizations
the
united
states
is
the
only
one
of
the
great
nations
in
which
the
forest
work
of
the
government
is
not
concentrated
under
one
department
in
consonance
with
the
plainest
dictates
of
good
administration
and
common
sense
the
present
arrangement
is
bad
from
every
point
of
view
merely
to
mention
it
is
to
prove
that
it
should
be
terminated
at
once
as
i
have
repeatedly
recommended
all
the
forest
work
of
the
government
should
be
concentrated
in
the
department
of
agriculture
where
the
larger
part
of
that
work
is
already
done
where
practically
all
of
the
trained
foresters
of
the
government
are
employed
where
chiefly
in
washington
there
is
comprehensive
firstclass
knowledge
of
the
problems
of
the
reserves
acquired
on
the
ground
where
all
problems
relating
to
growth
from
the
soil
are
already
gathered
and
where
all
the
sciences
auxiliary
to
forestry
are
at
hand
for
prompt
and
effective
cooperation
these
reasons
are
decisive
in
themselves
but
it
should
be
added
that
the
great
organizations
of
citizens
whose
interests
are
affected
by
the
forestreserves
such
as
the
national
live
stock
association
the
national
wool
growers
association
the
american
mining
congress
the
national
irrigation
congress
and
the
national
board
of
trade
have
uniformly
emphatically
and
most
of
them
repeatedly
expressed
themselves
in
favor
of
placing
all
government
forest
work
in
the
department
of
agriculture
because
of
the
peculiar
adaptation
of
that
department
for
it
it
is
true
also
that
the
forest
services
of
nearly
all
the
great
nations
of
the
world
are
under
the
respective
departments
of
agriculture
while
in
but
two
of
the
smaller
nations
and
in
one
colony
are
they
under
the
department
of
the
interior
this
is
the
result
of
long
and
varied
experience
and
it
agrees
fully
with
the
requirements
of
good
administration
in
our
own
case
the
creation
of
a
forest
service
in
the
department
of
agriculture
will
have
for
its
important
results
first
a
better
handling
of
all
forest
work
because
it
will
be
under
a
single
head
and
because
the
vast
and
indispensable
experience
of
the
department
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
forest
reserves
to
forestry
in
general
and
to
other
forms
of
production
from
the
soil
will
be
easily
and
rapidly
accessible
second
the
reserves
themselves
being
handled
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
man
in
the
field
instead
of
the
man
in
the
office
will
be
more
easily
and
more
widely
useful
to
the
people
of
the
west
than
has
been
the
case
hitherto
third
within
a
comparatively
short
time
the
reserves
will
become
selfsupporting
this
is
important
because
continually
and
rapidly
increasing
appropriations
will
be
necessary
for
the
proper
care
of
this
exceedingly
important
interest
of
the
nation
and
they
can
and
should
he
offset
by
returns
from
the
national
forests
under
similar
circumstances
the
forest
possessions
of
other
great
nations
form
an
important
source
of
revenue
to
their
governments
every
administrative
officer
concerned
is
convinced
of
the
necessity
for
the
proposed
consolidation
of
forest
work
in
the
department
of
agriculture
and
i
myself
have
urged
it
more
than
once
in
former
messages
again
i
commend
it
to
the
early
and
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
the
interests
of
the
nation
at
large
and
of
the
west
in
particular
have
suffered
greatly
because
of
the
delay
i
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
again
to
the
report
and
recommendation
of
the
commission
on
the
public
lands
forwarded
by
me
to
the
second
session
of
the
present
congress
the
commission
has
prosecuted
its
investigations
actively
during
the
past
season
and
a
second
report
is
now
in
an
advanced
stage
of
preparation
in
connection
with
the
work
of
the
forest
reserves
i
desire
again
to
urge
upon
the
congress
the
importance
of
authorizing
the
president
to
set
aside
certain
portions
of
these
reserves
or
other
public
lands
as
game
refuges
for
the
preservation
of
the
bison
the
wapiti
and
other
large
beasts
once
so
abundant
in
our
woods
and
mountains
and
on
our
great
plains
and
now
tending
toward
extinction
every
support
should
be
given
to
the
authorities
of
the
yellowstone
park
in
their
successful
efforts
at
preserving
the
large
creatures
therein
and
at
very
little
expense
portions
of
the
public
domain
in
other
regions
which
are
wholly
unsuited
to
agricultural
settlement
could
be
similarly
utilized
we
owe
it
to
future
generations
to
keep
alive
the
noble
and
beautiful
creatures
which
by
their
presence
add
such
distinctive
character
to
the
american
wilderness
the
limits
of
the
yellowstone
park
should
be
extended
southwards
the
canyon
of
the
colorado
should
be
made
a
national
park
and
the
nationalpark
system
should
include
the
yosemite
and
as
many
as
possible
of
the
groves
of
giant
trees
in
california
the
veterans
of
the
civil
war
have
a
claim
upon
the
nation
such
as
no
other
body
of
our
citizens
possess
the
pension
bureau
has
never
in
its
history
been
managed
in
a
more
satisfactory
manner
than
is
now
the
case
the
progress
of
the
indians
toward
civilization
though
not
rapid
is
perhaps
all
that
could
be
hoped
for
in
view
of
the
circumstances
within
the
past
year
many
tribes
have
shown
in
a
degree
greater
than
ever
before
an
appreciation
of
the
necessity
of
work
this
changed
attitude
is
in
part
due
to
the
policy
recently
pursued
of
reducing
the
amount
of
subsistence
to
the
indians
and
thus
forcing
them
through
sheer
necessity
to
work
for
a
livelihood
the
policy
though
severe
is
a
useful
one
but
it
is
to
be
exercised
only
with
judgment
and
with
a
full
understanding
of
the
conditions
which
exist
in
each
community
for
which
it
is
intended
on
or
near
the
indian
reservations
there
is
usually
very
little
demand
for
labor
and
if
the
indians
are
to
earn
their
living
and
when
work
can
not
be
furnished
from
outside
which
is
always
preferable
then
it
must
be
furnished
by
the
government
practical
instruction
of
this
kind
would
in
a
few
years
result
in
the
forming
of
habits
of
regular
industry
which
would
render
the
indian
a
producer
and
would
effect
a
great
reduction
in
the
cost
of
his
maintenance
it
is
commonly
declared
that
the

slow
advance
of
the
indians
is
due
to
the
unsatisfactory
character
of
the
men
appointed
to
take
immediate
charge
of
them
and
to
some
extent
this
is
true
while
the
standard
of
the
employees
in
the
indian
service
shows
great
improvement
over
that
of
bygone
years
and
while
actual
corruption
or
flagrant
dishonesty
is
now
the
rare
exception
it
is
nevertheless
the
fact
that
the
salaries
paid
indian
agents
are
not
large
enough
to
attract
the
best
men
to
that
field
of
work
to
achieve
satisfactory
results
the
official
in
charge
of
an
indian
tribe
should
possess
the
high
qualifications
which
are
required
in
the
manager
of
a
large
business
but
only
in
exceptional
cases
is
it
possible
to
secure
men
of
such
a
type
for
these
positions
much
better
service
however
might
be
obtained
from
those
now
holding
the
places
were
it
practicable
to
get
out
of
them
the
best
that
is
in
them
and
this
should
be
done
by
bringing
them
constantly
into
closer
touch
with
their
superior
officers
an
agent
who
has
been
content
to
draw
his
salary
giving
in
return
the
least
possible
equivalent
in
effort
and
service
may
by
proper
treatment
by
suggestion
and
encouragement
or
persistent
urging
be
stimulated
to
greater
effort
and
induced
to
take
a
more
active
personal
interest
in
his
work
under
existing
conditions
an
indian
agent
in
the
distant
west
may
be
wholly
out
of
touch
with
the
office
of
the
indian
bureau
he
may
very
well
feel
that
no
one
takes
a
personal
interest
in
him
or
his
efforts
certain
routine
duties
in
the
way
of
reports
and
accounts
are
required
of
him
but
there
is
no
one
with
whom
he
may
intelligently
consult
on
matters
vital
to
his
work
except
after
long
delay
such
a
man
would
be
greatly
encouraged
and
aided
by
personal
contact
with
some
one
whose
interest
in
indian
affairs
and
whose
authority
in
the
indian
bureau
were
greater
than
his
own
and
such
contact
would
be
certain
to
arouse
and
constantly
increase
the
interest
he
takes
in
his
work
the
distance
which
separates
the
agentsthe
workers
in
the
fieldfrom
the
indian
office
in
washington
is
a
chief
obstacle
to
indian
progress
whatever
shall
more
closely
unite
these
two
branches
of
the
indian
service
and
shall
enable
them
to
cooperate
more
heartily
and
more
effectively
will
be
for
the
increased
efficiency
of
the
work
and
the
betterment
of
the
race
for
whose
improvement
the
indian
bureau
was
established
the
appointment
of
a
field
assistant
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
would
be
certain
to
insure
this
good
end
such
an
official
if
possessed
of
the
requisite
energy
and
deep
interest
in
the
work
would
be
a
most
efficient
factor
in
bringing
into
closer
relationship
and
a
more
direct
union
of
effort
the
bureau
in
washington
and
its
agents
in
the
field
and
with
the
cooperation
of
its
branches
thus
secured
the
indian
bureau
would
in
measure
fuller
than
ever
before
lift
up
the
savage
toward
that
selfhelp
and
selfreliance
which
constitute
the
man
in
there
will
be
held
at
hampton
roads
the
tricentennial
celebration
of
the
settlement
at
jamestown
virginia
with
which
the
history
of
what
has
now
become
the
united
states
really
begins
i
commend
this
to
your
favorable
consideration
it
is
an
event
of
prime
historic
significance
in
which
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
should
feel
and
should
show
great
and
general
interest
in
the
postoffice
department
the
service
has
increased
in
efficiency
and
conditions
as
to
revenue
and
expenditure
continue
satisfactory
the
increase
of
revenue
during
the
year
was
or
per
cent
the
total
receipts
amounting
to
the
expenditures
were
an
increase
of
about
per
cent
over
the
previous
year
being
thus
in
excess
of
the
current
revenue
included
in
these
expenditures
was
a
total
appropriation
of
for
the
continuation
and
extension
of
the
rural
freedelivery
service
which
was
an
increase
of
over
the
amount
expended
for
this
purpose
in
the
preceding
fiscal
year
large
as
this
expenditure
has
been
the
beneficent
results
attained
in
extending
the
free
distribution
of
mails
to
the
residents
of
rural
districts
have
justified
the
wisdom
of
the
outlay
statistics
brought
down
to
the
st
of
october
show
that
on
that
date
there
were
rural
routes
established
serving
approximately
of
people
in
rural
districts
remote
from
postoffices
and
that
there
were
pending
at
that
time
petitions
for
the
establishment
of
new
rural
routes
unquestionably
some
part
of
the
general
increase
in
receipts
is
due
to
the
increased
postal
facilities
which
the
rural
service
has
afforded
the
revenues
have
also
been
aided
greatly
by
amendments
in
the
classification
of
mail
matter
and
the
curtailment
of
abuses
of
the
secondclass
mailing
privilege
the
average
increase
in
the
volume
of
mail
matter
for
the
period
beginning
with
and
ending
june
that
portion
for
being
estimated
is
per
cent
as
compared
with
per
cent
for
the
period
immediately
preceding
and
for
the
fouryear
period
immediately
preceding
that
our
consular
system
needs
improvement
salaries
should
be
substituted
for
fees
and
the
proper
classification
grading
and
transfer
of
consular
officers
should
be
provided
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
a
competitive
system
of
examinations
for
appointment
would
work
well
but
by
law
it
should
be
provided
that
consuls
should
be
familiar
according
to
places
for
which
they
apply
with
the
french
german
or
spanish
languages
and
should
possess
acquaintance
with
the
resources
of
the
united
states
the
collection
of
objects
of
art
contemplated
in
section
of
the
revised
statutes
should
be
designated
and
established
as
a
national
gallery
of
art
and
the
smithsonian
institution
should
be
authorized
to
accept
any
additions
to
said
collection
that
may
be
received
by
gift
bequest
or
devise
it
is
desirable
to
enact
a
proper
national
quarantine
law
it
is
most
undesirable
that
a
state
should
on
its
own
initiative
enforce
quarantine
regulations
which
are
in
effect
a
restriction
upon
interstate
and
international
commerce
the
question
should
properly
be
assumed
by
the
government
alone
the
surgeongeneral
of
the
national
public
health
and
marinehospital
service
has
repeatedly
and
convincingly
set
forth
the
need
for
such
legislation
i
call
your
attention
to
the
great
extravagance
in
printing
and
binding
government
publications
and
especially
to
the
fact
that
altogether
too
many
of
these
publications
are
printed
there
is
a
constant
tendency
to
increase
their
number
and
their
volume
it
is
an
understatement
to
say
that
no
appreciable
harm
would
be
caused
by
and
substantial
benefit
would
accrue
from
decreasing
the
amount
of
printing
now
done
by
at
least
onehalf
probably
the
great
majority
of
the
government
reports
and
the
like
now
printed
are
never
read
at
all
and
furthermore
the
printing
of
much
of
the
material
contained
in
many
of
the
remaining
ones
serves
no
useful
purpose
whatever
the
attention
of
the
congress
should
be
especially
given
to
the
currency
question
and
that
the
standing
committees
on
the
matter
in
the
two
houses
charged
with
the
duty
take
up
the
matter
of
our
currency
and
see
whether
it
is
not
possible
to
secure
an
agreement
in
the
business
world
for
bettering
the
system
the
committees
should
consider
the
question
of
the
retirement
of
the
greenbacks
and
the
problem
of
securing
in
our
currency
such
elasticity
as
is
consistent
with
safety
every
silver
dollar
should
be
made
by
law
redeemable
in
gold
at
the
option
of
the
holder
i
especially
commend
to
your
immediate
attention
the
encouragement
of
our
merchant
marine
by
appropriate
legislation
the
growing
importance
of
the
orient
as
a
field
for
american
exports
drew
from
my
predecessor
president
mckinley
an
urgent
request
for
its
special
consideration
by
the
congress
in
his
message
of
he
stated
in
this
relation
as
showing
the
peculiar
volume
and
value
of
our
trade
with
china
and
the
peculiarly
favorable
conditions
which
exist
for
their
expansion
in
the
normal
course
of
trade
i
refer
to
the
communication
addressed
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
the
th
of
last
june
with
its
accompanying
letter
of
the
secretary
of
state
recommending
an
appropriation
for
a
commission
to
study
the
industrial
and
commercial
conditions
in
the
chinese
empire
and
to
report
as
to
the
opportunities
for
and
the
obstacles
to
the
enlargement
of
markets
in
china
for
the
raw
products
and
manufactures
of
the
united
states
action
was
not
taken
thereon
during
the
last
session
i
cordially
urge
that
the
recommendation
receive
at
your
hands
the
consideration
which
its
importance
and
timeliness
merit
in
his
annual
message
of
he
again
called
attention
to
this
recommendation
quoting
it
and
stated
further
i
now
renew
this
recommendation
as
the
importance
of
the
subject
has
steadily
grown
since
it
was
first
submitted
to
you
and
no
time
should
be
lost
in
studying
for
ourselves
the
resources
of
this
great
field
for
american
trade
and
enterprise
the
importance
of
securing
proper
information
and
data
with
a
view
to
the
enlargement
of
our
trade
with
asia
is
undiminished
our
consular
representatives
in
china
have
strongly
urged
a
place
for
permanent
display
of
american
products
in
some
prominent
trade
center
of
that
empire
under
government
control
and
management
as
an
effective
means
of
advancing
our
export
trade
therein
i
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
desirability
of
carrying
out
these
suggestions
in
dealing
with
the
questions
of
immigration
and
naturalization
it
is
indispensable
to
keep
certain
facts
ever
before
the
minds
of
those
who
share
in
enacting
the
laws
first
and
foremost
let
us
remember
that
the
question
of
being
a
good
american
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
a
mans
birthplace
any
more
than
it
has
to
do
with
his
creed
in
every
generation
from
the
time
this
government
was
founded
men
of
foreign
birth
have
stood
in
the
very
foremost
rank
of
good
citizenship
and
that
not
merely
in
one
but
in
every
field
of
american
activity
while
to
try
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
man
whose
parents
came
to
this
country
and
the
man
whose
ancestors
came
to
it
several
generations

back
is
a
mere
absurdity
good
americanism
is
a
matter
of
heart
of
conscience
of
lofty
aspiration
of
sound
common
sense
but
not
of
birthplace
or
of
creed
the
medal
of
honor
the
highest
prize
to
be
won
by
those
who
serve
in
the
army
and
the
navy
of
the
united
states
decorates
men
born
here
and
it
also
decorates
men
born
in
great
britain
and
ireland
in
germany
in
scandinavia
in
france
and
doubtless
in
other
countries
also
in
the
field
of
statesmanship
in
the
field
of
business
in
the
field
of
philanthropic
endeavor
it
is
equally
true
that
among
the
men
of
whom
we
are
most
proud
as
americans
no
distinction
whatever
can
be
drawn
between
those
who
themselves
or
whose
parents
came
over
in
sailing
ship
or
steamer
from
across
the
water
and
those
whose
ancestors
stepped
ashore
into
the
wooded
wilderness
at
plymouth
or
at
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
the
delaware
or
the
james
nearly
three
centuries
ago
no
fellowcitizen
of
ours
is
entitled
to
any
peculiar
regard
because
of
the
way
in
which
he
worships
his
maker
or
because
of
the
birthplace
of
himself
or
his
parents
nor
should
he
be
in
any
way
discriminated
against
therefor
each
must
stand
on
his
worth
as
a
man
and
each
is
entitled
to
be
judged
solely
thereby
there
is
no
danger
of
having
too
many
immigrants
of
the
right
kind
it
makes
no
difference
from
what
country
they
come
if
they
are
sound
in
body
and
in
mind
and
above
all
if
they
are
of
good
character
so
that
we
can
rest
assured
that
their
children
and
grandchildren
will
be
worthy
fellowcitizens
of
our
children
and
grandchildren
then
we
should
welcome
them
with
cordial
hospitality
but
the
citizenship
of
this
country
should
not
be
debased
it
is
vital
that
we
should
keep
high
the
standard
of
wellbeing
among
our
wageworkers
and
therefore
we
should
not
admit
masses
of
men
whose
standards
of
living
and
whose
personal
customs
and
habits
are
such
that
they
tend
to
lower
the
level
of
the
american
wageworker
and
above
all
we
should
not
admit
any
man
of
an
unworthy
type
any
man
concerning
whom
we
can
say
that
he
will
himself
be
a
bad
citizen
or
that
his
children
and
grandchildren
will
detract
from
instead
of
adding
to
the
sum
of
the
good
citizenship
of
the
country
similarly
we
should
take
the
greatest
care
about
naturalization
fraudulent
naturalization
the
naturalization
of
improper
persons
is
a
curse
to
our
government
and
it
is
the
affair
of
every
honest
voter
wherever
born
to
see
that
no
fraudulent
voting
is
allowed
that
no
fraud
in
connection
with
naturalization
is
permitted
in
the
past
year
the
cases
of
false
fraudulent
and
improper
naturalization
of
aliens
coming
to
the
attention
of
the
executive
branches
of
the
government
have
increased
to
an
alarming
degree
extensive
sales
of
forged
certificates
of
naturalization
have
been
discovered
as
well
as
many
cases
of
naturalization
secured
by
perjury
and
fraud
and
in
addition
instances
have
accumulated
showing
that
many
courts
issue
certificates
of
naturalization
carelessly
and
upon
insufficient
evidence
under
the
constitution
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
congress
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization
and
numerous
laws
have
from
time
to
time
been
enacted
for
that
purpose
which
have
been
supplemented
in
a
few
states
by
state
laws
having
special
application
the
federal
statutes
permit
naturalization
by
any
court
of
record
in
the
united
states
having
commonlaw
jurisdiction
and
a
seal
and
clerk
except
the
police
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
nearly
all
these
courts
exercise
this
important
function
it
results
that
where
so
many
courts
of
such
varying
grades
have
jurisdiction
there
is
lack
of
uniformity
in
the
rules
applied
in
conferring
naturalization
some
courts
are
strict
and
others
lax
an
alien
who
may
secure
naturalization
in
one
place
might
be
denied
it
in
another
and
the
intent
of
the
constitutional
provision
is
in
fact
defeated
furthermore
the
certificates
of
naturalization
issued
by
the
courts
differ
widely
in
wording
and
appearance
and
when
they
are
brought
into
use
in
foreign
countries
are
frequently
subject
to
suspicion
there
should
be
a
comprehensive
revision
of
the
naturalization
laws
the
courts
having
power
to
naturalize
should
be
definitely
named
by
national
authority
the
testimony
upon
which
naturalization
may
be
conferred
should
be
definitely
prescribed
publication
of
impending
naturalization
applications
should
be
required
in
advance
of
their
hearing
in
court
the
form
and
wording
of
all
certificates
issued
should
be
uniform
throughout
the
country
and
the
courts
should
be
required
to
make
returns
to
the
secretary
of
state
at
stated
periods
of
all
naturalizations
conferred
not
only
are
the
laws
relating
to
naturalization
now
defective
but
those
relating
to
citizenship
of
the
united
states
ought
also
to
be
made
the
subject
of
scientific
inquiry
with
a
view
to
probable
further
legislation
by
what
acts
expatriation
may
be
assumed
to
have
been
accomplished
how
long
an
american
citizen
may
reside
abroad
and
receive
the
protection
of
our
passport
whether
any
degree
of
protection
should
be
extended
to
one
who
has
made
the
declaration
of
intention
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
but
has
not
secured
naturalization
are
questions
of
serious
import
involving
personal
rights
and
often
producing
friction
between
this
government
and
foreign
governments
yet
upon
these
question
our
laws
are
silent
i
recommend
that
an
examination
be
made
into
the
subjects
of
citizenship
expatriation
and
protection
of
americans
abroad
with
a
view
to
appropriate
legislation
the
power
of
the
government
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
elections
of
its
own
officials
is
inherent
and
has
been
recognized
and
affirmed
by
repeated
declarations
of
the
supreme
court
there
is
no
enemy
of
free
government
more
dangerous
and
none
so
insidious
as
the
corruption
of
the
electorate
no
one
defends
or
excuses
corruption
and
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
none
would
oppose
vigorous
measures
to
eradicate
it
i
recommend
the
enactment
of
a
law
directed
against
bribery
and
corruption
in
federal
elections
the
details
of
such
a
law
may
be
safely
left
to
the
wise
discretion
of
the
congress
but
it
should
go
as
far
as
under
the
constitution
it
is
possible
to
go
and
should
include
severe
penalties
against
him
who
gives
or
receives
a
bribe
intended
to
influence
his
act
or
opinion
as
an
elector
and
provisions
for
the
publication
not
only
of
the
expenditures
for
nominations
and
elections
of
all
candidates
but
also
of
all
contributions
received
and
expenditures
made
by
political
committees
no
subject
is
better
worthy
the
attention
of
the
congress
than
that
portion
of
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
dealing
with
the
long
delays
and
the
great
obstruction
to
justice
experienced
in
the
cases
of
beavers
green
and
gaynor
and
benson
were
these
isolated
and
special
cases
i
should
not
call
your
attention
to
them
but
the
difficulties
encountered
as
regards
these
men
who
have
been
indicted
for
criminal
practices
are
not
exceptional
they
are
precisely
similar
in
kind
to
what
occurs
again
and
again
in
the
case
of
criminals
who
have
sufficient
means
to
enable
them
to
take
advantage
of
a
system
of
procedure
which
has
grown
up
in
the
federal
courts
and
which
amounts
in
effect
to
making
the
law
easy
of
enforcement
against
the
man
who
has
no
money
and
difficult
of
enforcement
even
to
the
point
of
sometimes
securing
immunity
as
regards
the
man
who
has
money
in
criminal
cases
the
writ
of
the
united
states
should
run
throughout
its
borders
the
wheels
of
justice
should
not
be
clogged
as
they
have
been
clogged
in
the
cases
above
mentioned
where
it
has
proved
absolutely
impossible
to
bring
the
accused
to
the
place
appointed
by
the
constitution
for
his
trial
of
recent
years
there
has
been
grave
and
increasing
complaint
of
the
difficulty
of
bringing
to
justice
those
criminals
whose
criminality
instead
of
being
against
one
person
in
the
republic
is
against
all
persons
in
the
republic
because
it
is
against
the
republic
itself
under
any
circumstance
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
it
is
often
exceedingly
difficult
to
secure
proper
punishment
of
those
who
have
been
guilty
of
wrongdoing
against
the
government
by
the
time
the
offender
can
be
brought
into
court
the
popular
wrath
against
him
has
generally
subsided
and
there
is
in
most
instances
very
slight
danger
indeed
of
any
prejudice
existing
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
against
him
at
present
the
interests
of
the
innocent
man
are
amply
safeguarded
but
the
interests
of
the
government
that
is
the
interests
of
honest
administration
that
is
the
interests
of
the
people
are
not
recognized
as
they
should
be
no
subject
better
warrants
the
attention
of
the
congress
indeed
no
subject
better
warrants
the
attention
of
the
bench
and
the
bar
throughout
the
united
states
alaska
like
all
our
territorial
acquisitions
has
proved
resourceful
beyond
the
expectations
of
those
who
made
the
purchase
it
has
become
the
home
of
many
hardy
industrious
and
thrifty
american
citizens
towns
of
a
permanent
character
have
been
built
the
extent
of
its
wealth
in
minerals
timber
fisheries
and
agriculture
while
great
is
probably
not
comprehended
yet
in
any
just
measure
by
our
people
we
do
know
however
that
from
a
very
small
beginning
its
products
have
grown
until
they
are
a
steady
and
material
contribution
to
the
wealth
of
the
nation
owing
to
the
immensity
of
alaska
and
its
location
in
the
far
north
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
provide
many
things
essential
to
its
growth
and
to
the
happiness
and
comfort
of
its
people
by
private
enterprise
alone
it
should
therefore
receive
reasonable
aid
from
the
government
the
government
has
already
done
excellent
work
for
alaska
in
laying
cables
and
building
telegraph
lines
this
work
has
been
done
in
the
most
economical
and
efficient
way
by
the
signal
corps
of
the
army
in
some
respects
it
has
outgrown
its
present
laws
while
in
others
those
laws
have
been
found
to
be
inadequate
in
order
to
obtain
information
upon
which
i
could
rely
i
caused
an
official
of
the
department
of
justice
in
whose
judgment
i
have

confidence
to
visit
alaska
during
the
past
summer
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
how
government
is
administered
there
and
what
legislation
is
actually
needed
at
present
a
statement
of
the
conditions
found
to
exist
together
with
some
recommendations
and
the
reasons
therefor
in
which
i
strongly
concur
will
be
found
in
the
annual
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
in
some
instances
i
feel
that
the
legislation
suggested
is
so
imperatively
needed
that
i
am
moved
briefly
to
emphasize
the
attorneygenerals
proposals
under
the
code
of
alaska
as
it
now
stands
many
purely
administrative
powers
and
duties
including
by
far
the
most
important
devolve
upon
the
district
judges
or
upon
the
clerks
of
the
district
court
acting
under
the
direction
of
the
judges
while
the
governor
upon
whom
these
powers
and
duties
should
logically
fall
has
nothing
specific
to
do
except
to
make
annual
reports
issue
thanksgiving
day
proclamations
and
appoint
indian
policemen
and
notaries
public
i
believe
it
essential
to
good
government
in
alaska
and
therefore
recommend
that
the
congress
divest
the
district
judges
and
the
clerks
of
their
courts
of
the
administrative
or
executive
functions
that
they
now
exercise
and
cast
them
upon
the
governor
this
would
not
be
an
innovation
it
would
simply
conform
the
government
of
alaska
to
fundamental
principles
making
the
governorship
a
real
instead
of
a
merely
nominal
office
and
leaving
the
judges
free
to
give
their
entire
attention
to
their
judicial
duties
and
at
the
same
time
removing
them
from
a
great
deal
of
the
strife
that
now
embarrasses
the
judicial
office
in
alaska
i
also
recommend
that
the
salaries
of
the
district
judges
and
district
attorneys
in
alaska
be
increased
so
as
to
make
them
equal
to
those
received
by
corresponding
officers
in
the
united
states
after
deducting
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
living
that
the
district
attorneys
should
be
prohibited
from
engaging
in
private
practice
that
united
states
commissioners
be
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
territory
instead
of
by
the
district
judges
and
that
a
fixed
salary
be
provided
for
them
to
take
the
place
of
the
discredited
fee
system
which
should
be
abolished
in
all
offices
that
a
mounted
constabulary
be
created
to
police
the
territory
outside
the
limits
of
incorporated
townsa
vast
section
now
wholly
without
police
protection
and
that
some
provision
be
made
to
at
least
lessen
the
oppressive
delays
and
costs
that
now
attend
the
prosecution
of
appeals
from
the
district
court
of
alaska
there
should
be
a
division
of
the
existing
judicial
districts
and
an
increase
in
the
number
of
judges
alaska
should
have
a
delegate
in
the
congress
where
possible
the
congress
should
aid
in
the
construction
of
needed
wagon
roads
additional
lighthouses
should
be
provided
in
my
judgment
it
is
especially
important
to
aid
in
such
manner
as
seems
just
and
feasible
in
the
construction
of
a
trunk
line
of
railway
to
connect
the
gulf
of
alaska
with
the
yukon
river
through
american
territory
this
would
be
most
beneficial
to
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
territory
and
to
the
comfort
and
welfare
of
its
people
salmon
hatcheries
should
be
established
in
many
different
streams
so
as
to
secure
the
preservation
of
this
valuable
food
fish
salmon
fisheries
and
canneries
should
be
prohibited
on
certain
of
the
rivers
where
the
mass
of
those
indians
dwell
who
live
almost
exclusively
on
fish
the
alaskan
natives
are
kindly
intelligent
anxious
to
learn
and
willing
to
work
those
who
have
come
under
the
influence
of
civilization
even
for
a
limited
period
have
proved
their
capability
of
becoming
selfsupporting
selfrespecting

only
for
the
just
enforcement
of

and
intelligent
instruction
and
supervision
others
living
in

remote
regions
primitive

fisher
folk
who

the

of

confronted
with
twentiethcentury
civilization
with
all
of
its
complexities
their

being
overrun
by
strangers
the

slaughtered
and
driven
away
the
streams
depleted
of

and
hitherto
unknown

fatal
diseases
brought
to
them
all
of
which
combine
to
produce
a
state
of
abject
poverty
and
want
which
must
result
in
their
extinction
action
in
their
interest
is
demanded
by
every
consideration
of
justice
and
humanity
the
needs
of
these
people
are
the
abolition
of
the
present
fee
system
whereby
the
native
is
degraded
imposed
upon
and
taught
the
injustice
of
law
the
establishment
of
hospitals
at
central
points
so
that
contagious
diseases
that
are
brought
to
them
continually
by
incoming
whites
may
be
localized
and
not
allowed
to
become
epidemic
to
spread
death
and
destitution
over
great
areas
the
development
of
the
educational
system
in
the
form
of
practical
training
in
such
industries
as
will
assure
the
indians
selfsupport
under
the
changed
conditions
in
which
they
will
have
to
live
the
duties
of
the
office
of
the
governor
should
be
extended
to
include
the
supervision
of
indian
affairs
with
necessary
assistants
in
different
districts
he
should
be
provided
with
the
means
and
the
power
to
protect
and
advise
the
native
people
to
furnish
medical
treatment
in
time
of
epidemics
and
to
extend
material
relief
in
periods
of
famine
and
extreme
destitution
the
alaskan
natives
should
be
given
the
right
to
acquire

and
dispose
of
property
upon
the

conditions
as
given
other

and
the
privilege
of

should
be
given
to
such
as
may
be

in

congress
should
give

power
to

the
harbor
of
honolulu
should
be
dredged
the

should
be

in

i
ask
special
consideration
for
the
report
and
recommendation
of
the
governor
of
porto
rico
in
treating
of
our
foreign
policy
and
of
the
attitude
that
this
great
nation
should
assume
in
the
world
at
large
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
consider
the
army
and
the
navy
and
the
congress
through
which
the
thought
of
the
nation
finds
its
expression
should
keep
ever
vividly
in
mind
the
fundamental
fact
that
it
is
impossible
to
treat
our
foreign
policy
whether
this
policy
takes
shape
in
the
effort
to
secure
justice
for
others
or
justice
for
ourselves
save
as
conditioned
upon
the
attitude
we
are
willing
to
take
toward
our
army
and
especially
toward
our
navy
it
is
not
merely
unwise
it
is
contemptible
for
a
nation
as
for
an
individual
to
use
highsounding
language
to
proclaim
its
purposes
or
to
take
positions
which
are
ridiculous
if
unsupported
by
potential
force
and
then
to
refuse
to
provide
this
force
if
there
is
no
intention
of
providing
and
of
keeping
the
force
necessary
to
back
up
a
strong
attitude
then
it
is
far
better
not
to
assume
such
an
attitude
the
steady
aim
of
this
nation
as
of
all
enlightened
nations
should
be
to
strive
to
bring
ever
nearer
the
day
when
there
shall
prevail
throughout
the
world
the
peace
of
justice
there
are
kinds
of
peace
which
are
highly
undesirable
which
are
in
the
long
run
as
destructive
as
any
war
tyrants
and
oppressors
have
many
times
made
a
wilderness
and
called
it
peace
many
times
peoples
who
were
slothful
or
timid
or
shortsighted
who
had
been
enervated
by
ease
or
by
luxury
or
misled
by
false
teachings
have
shrunk
in
unmanly
fashion
from
doing
duty
that
was
stern
and
that
needed
selfsacrifice
and
have
sought
to
hide
from
their
own
minds
their
shortcomings
their
ignoble
motives
by
calling
them
love
of
peace
the
peace
of
tyrannous
terror
the
peace
of
craven
weakness
the
peace
of
injustice
all
these
should
be
shunned
as
we
shun
unrighteous
war
the
goal
to
set
before
us
as
a
nation
the
goal
which
should
be
set
before
all
mankind
is
the
attainment
of
the
peace
of
justice
of
the
peace
which
comes
when
each
nation
is
not
merely
safeguarded
in
its
own
rights
but
scrupulously
recognizes
and
performs
its
duty
toward
others
generally
peace
tells
for
righteousness
but
if
there
is
conflict
between
the
two
then
our
fealty
is
duefirst
to
the
cause
of
righteousness
unrighteous
wars
are
common
and
unrighteous
peace
is
rare
but
both
should
be
shunned
the
right
of
freedom
and
the
responsibility
for
the
exercise
of
that
right
can
not
be
divorced
one
of
our
great
poets
has
well
and
finely
said
that
freedom
is
not
a
gift
that
tarries
long
in
the
hands
of
cowards
neither
does
it
tarry
long
in
the
hands
of
those
too
slothful
too
dishonest
or
too
unintelligent
to
exercise
it
the
eternal
vigilance
which
is
the
price
of
liberty
must
be
exercised
sometimes
to
guard
against
outside
foes
although
of
course
far
more
often
to
guard
against
our
own
selfish
or
thoughtless
shortcomings
if
these
selfevident
truths
are
kept
before
us
and
only
if
they
are
so
kept
before
us
we
shall
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
our
foreign
policy
in
its
larger
aspects
should
be
it
is
our
duty
to
remember
that
a
nation
has
no
more
right
to
do
injustice
to
another
nation
strong
or
weak
than
an
individual
has
to
do
injustice
to
another
individual
that
the
same
moral
law
applies
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
but
we
must
also
remember
that
it
is
as
much
the
duty
of
the
nation
to
guard
its
own
rights
and
its
own
interests
as
it
is
the
duty
of
the
individual
so
to
do
within
the
nation
the
individual
has
now
delegated
this
right
to
the
state
that
is
to
the
representative
of
all
the
individuals
and
it
is
a
maxim
of
the
law
that
for
every
wrong
there
is
a
remedy
but
in
international
law
we
have
not
advanced
by
any
means
as
far
as
we
have
advanced
in
municipal
law
there
is
as
yet
no
judicial
way
of
enforcing
a
right
in
international
law
when
one
nation
wrongs
another
or
wrongs
many
others
there
is
no
tribunal
before
which
the
wrongdoer
can
be
brought
either
it
is
necessary
supinely
to
acquiesce
in
the
wrong
and
thus
put
a
premium
upon
brutality
and
aggression
or
else
it
is
necessary
for
the
aggrieved
nation
valiantly
to
stand
up
for
its
rights
until
some
method
is
devised
by
which
there
shall
be
a
degree
of
international
control
over
offending
nations
it
would
be
a
wicke
d
thing
for
the
most
civilized
powers
for
those
with
most
sense
of
international
obligations
and
with
keenest
and
most
generous
appreciation
of
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
to
disarm
if
the
great
civilized
nations
of
the
present
day
should
completely
disarm
the
result
would
mean
an
immediate
recrudescence
of
barbarism
in
one
form
or
another
under
any
circumstances
a
sufficient
armament
would
have
to
be
kept
up
to
serve
the
purposes
of
international
police
and
until
international
cohesion
and
the
sense
of
international
duties
and
rights
are
far
more
advanced
than
at
present
a
nation
desirous
both
of
securing
respect
for
itself
and
of
doing
good
to
others
must
have
a
force
adequate
for
the
work
which
it
feels
is
allotted
to
it
as
its
part
of
the
general
world
duty
therefore
it
follows
that
a
selfrespecting
just
and
farseeing
nation
should
on
the
one
hand
endeavor
by
every
means
to
aid
in
the
development
of
the
various
movements
which
tend
to
provide
substitutes
for
war
which
tend
to
render
nations
in
their
actions
toward
one
another
and
indeed
toward
their
own
peoples
more
responsive
to
the
general
sentiment
of
humane
and
civilized
mankind
and
on
the
other
hand
that
it
should
keep
prepared
while
scrupulously
avoiding
wrongdoing
itself
to
repel
any
wrong
and
in
exceptional
cases
to
take
action
which
in
a
more
advanced
stage
of
international
relations
would
come
under
the
head
of
the
exercise
of
the
international
police
a
great
free
people
owes
it
to
itself
and
to
all
mankind
not
to
sink
into
helplessness
before
the
powers
of
evil
we
are
in
every
way
endeavoring
to
help
on
with
cordial
good
will
every
movement
which
will
tend
to
bring
us
into
more
friendly
relations
with
the
rest
of
mankind
in
pursuance
of
this
policy
i
shall
shortly
lay
before
the
senate
treaties
of
arbitration
with
all
powers
which
are
willing
to
enter
into
these
treaties
with
us
it
is
not
possible
at
this
period
of
the
worlds
development
to
agree
to
arbitrate
all
matters
but
there
are
many
matters
of
possible
difference
between
us
and
other
nations
which
can
be
thus
arbitrated
furthermore
at
the
request
of
the
interparliamentary
union
an
eminent
body
composed
of
practical
statesmen
from
all
countries
i
have
asked
the
powers
to
join
with
this
government
in
a
second
hague
conference
at
which
it
is
hoped
that
the
work
already
so
happily
begun
at
the
hague
may
be
carried
some
steps
further
toward
completion
this
carries
out
the
desire
expressed
by
the
first
hague
conference
itself
it
is
not
true
that
the
united
states
feels
any
land
hunger
or
entertains
any
projects
as
regards
the
other
nations
of
the
western
hemisphere
save
such
as
are
for
their
welfare
all
that
this
country
desires
is
to
see
the
neighboring
countries
stable
orderly
and
prosperous
any
country
whose
people
conduct
themselves
well
can
count
upon
our
hearty
friendship
if
a
nation
shows
that
it
knows
how
to
act
with
reasonable
efficiency
and
decency
in
social
and
political
matters
if
it
keeps
order
and
pays
its
obligations
it
need
fear
no
interference
from
the
united
states
chronic
wrongdoing
or
an
impotence
which
results
in
a
general
loosening
of
the
ties
of
civilized
society
may
in
america
as
elsewhere
ultimately
require
intervention
by
some
civilized
nation
and
in
the
western
hemisphere
the
adherence
of
the
united
states
to
the
monroe
doctrine
may
force
the
united
states
however
reluctantly
in
flagrant
cases
of
such
wrongdoing
or
impotence
to
the
exercise
of
an
international
police
power
if
every
country
washed
by
the
caribbean
sea
would
show
the
progress
in
stable
and
just
civilization
which
with
the
aid
of
the
platt
amendment
cuba
has
shown
since
our
troops
left
the
island
and
which
so
many
of
the
republics
in
both
americas
are
constantly
and
brilliantly
showing
all
question
of
interference
by
this
nation
with
their
affairs
would
be
at
an
end
our
interests
and
those
of
our
southern
neighbors
are
in
reality
identical
they
have
great
natural
riches
and
if
within
their
borders
the
reign
of
law
and
justice
obtains
prosperity
is
sure
to
come
to
them
while
they
thus
obey
the
primary
laws
of
civilized
society
they
may
rest
assured
that
they
will
be
treated
by
us
in
a
spirit
of
cordial
and
helpful
sympathy
we
would
interfere
with
them
only
in
the
last
resort
and
then
only
if
it
became
evident
that
their
inability
or
unwillingness
to
do
justice
at
home
and
abroad
had
violated
the
rights
of
the
united
states
or
had
invited
foreign
aggression
to
the
detriment
of
the
entire
body
of
american
nations
it
is
a
mere
truism
to
say
that
every
nation
whether
in
america
or
anywhere
else
which
desires
to
maintain
its
freedom
its
independence
must
ultimately
realize
that
the
right
of
such
independence
can
not
be
separated
from
the
responsibility
of
making
good
use
of
it
in
asserting
the
monroe
doctrine
in
taking
such
steps
as
we
have
taken
in
regard
to
cuba
venezuela
and
panama
and
in
endeavoring
to
circumscribe
the
theater
of
war
in
the
far
east
and
to
secure
the
open
door
in
china
we
have
acted
in
our
own
interest
as
well
as
in
the
interest
of
humanity
at
large
there
are
however
cases
in
which
while
our
own
interests
are
not
greatly
involved
strong
appeal
is
made
to
our
sympathies
ordinarily
it
is
very
much
wiser
and
more
useful
for
us
to
concern
ourselves
with
striving
for
our
own
moral
and
material
betterment
here
at
home
than
to
concern
ourselves
with
trying
to
better
the
condition
of
things
in
other
nations
we
have
plenty
of
sins
of
our
own
to
war
against
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
we
can
do
more
for
the
general
uplifting
of
humanity
by
striving
with
heart
and
soul
to
put
a
stop
to
civic
corruption
to
brutal
lawlessness
and
violent
race
prejudices
here
at
home
than
by
passing
resolutions
about
wrongdoing
elsewhere
nevertheless
there
are
occasional
crimes
committed
on
so
vast
a
scale
and
of
such
peculiar
horror
as
to
make
us
doubt
whether
it
is
not
our
manifest
duty
to
endeavor
at
least
to
show
our
disapproval
of
the
deed
and
our
sympathy
with
those
who
have
suffered
by
it
the
cases
must
be
extreme
in
which
such
a
course
is
justifiable
there
must
be
no
effort
made
to
remove
the
mote
from
our
brothers
eye
if
we
refuse
to
remove
the
beam
from
our
own
but
in
extreme
cases
action
may
be
justifiable
and
proper
what
form
the
action
shall
take
must
depend
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
case
that
is
upon
the
degree
of
the
atrocity
and
upon
our
power
to
remedy
it
the
cases
in
which
we
could
interfere
by
force
of
arms
as
we
interfered
to
put
a
stop
to
intolerable
conditions
in
cuba
are
necessarily
very
few
yet
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
a
people
like
ours
which
in
spite
of
certain
very
obvious
shortcomings
nevertheless
as
a
whole
shows
by
its
consistent
practice
its
belief
in
the
principles
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
of
orderly
freedom
a
people
among
whom
even
the
worst
crime
like
the
crime
of
lynching
is
never
more
than
sporadic
so
that
individuals
and
not
classes
are
molested
in
their
fundamental
rightsit
is
inevitable
that
such
a
nation
should
desire
eagerly
to
give
expression
to
its
horror
on
an
occasion
like
that
of
the
massacre
of
the
jews
in
kishenef
or
when
it
witnesses
such
systematic
and
longextended
cruelty
and
oppression
as
the
cruelty
and
oppression
of
which
the
armenians
have
been
the
victims
and
which
have
won
for
them
the
indignant
pity
of
the
civilized
world
even
where
it
is
not
possible
to
secure
in
other
nations
the
observance
of
the
principles
which
we
accept
as
axiomatic
it
is
necessary
for
us
firmly
to
insist
upon
the
rights
of
our
own
citizens
without
regard
to
their
creed
or
race
without
regard
to
whether
they
were
born
here
or
born
abroad
it
has
proved
very
difficult
to
secure
from
russia
the
right
for
our
jewish
fellowcitizens
to
receive
passports
and
travel
through
russian
territory
such
conduct
is
not
only
unjust
and
irritating
toward
us
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
its
wisdom
from
russias
standpoint
no
conceivable
good
is
accomplished
by
it
if
an
american
jew
or
an
american
christian
misbehaves
himself
in
russia
he
can
at
once
be
driven
out
but
the
ordinary
american
jew
like
the
ordinary
american
christian
would
behave
just
about
as
he
behaves
here
that
is
behave
as
any
good
citizen
ought
to
behave
and
where
this
is
the
case
it
is
a
wrong
against
which
we
are
entitled
to
protest
to
refuse
him
his
passport
without
regard
to
his
conduct
and
character
merely
on
racial
and
religious
grounds
in
turkey
our
difficulties
arise
less
from
the
way
in
which
our
citizens
are
sometimes
treated
than
from
the
indignation
inevitably
excited
in
seeing
such
fearful
misrule
as
has
been
witnessed
both
in
armenia
and
macedonia
the
strong
arm
of
the
government
in
enforcing
respect
for
its
just
rights
in
international
matters
is
the
navy
of
the
united
states
i
most
earnestly
recommend
that
there
be
no
halt
in
the
work
of
upbuilding
the
american
navy
there
is
no
more
patriotic
duty
before
us
a
people
than
to
keep
the
navy
adequate
to
the
needs
of
this
countrys
position
we
have
undertaken
to
build
the
isthmian
canal
we
have
undertaken
to
secure
for
ourselves
our
just
share
in
the
trade
of
the
orient
we
have
undertaken
to
protect
our
citizens
from
proper
treatment
in
foreign
lands
we
continue
steadily
to
insist
on
the
application
of
the
monroe
doctrine
to
the
western
hemisphere
unless
our
attitude
in
these
and
all
similar
matters
is
to
be
a
mere
boastful
sham
we
can
not
afford
to
abandon
our
naval
programme
our
voice
is
now
potent
for
peace
and
is
so
potent
because
we
are
not
afraid
of
war
but
our
protestations
upon
behalf
of
peace
would
neither
receive
nor
deserve
the
slightest
attention
if
we
were
impotent
to
make
them
good
the
war
which
now
unfortunately
rages
in
the
far
east
has
emphasized
in
striking
fashion
the
new
possibilities
of
naval
warfare
the
lessons
taught
are
both
strategic
and
tactical
and
are
political
as
well
as
military
the
experiences
of
the
war
have
shown
in
conclusive
fashion
that
while
seagoing
and
seakeeping
torpedo
destroyers
are
indispensable
and
fast
li
ghtly
armed
and
armored
cruisers
very
useful
yet
that
the
main
reliance
the
main
standby
in
any
navy
worthy
the
name
must
be
the
great
battle
ships
heavily
armored
and
heavily
gunned
not
a
russian
or
japanese
battle
ship
has
been
sunk
by
a
torpedo
boat
or
by
gunfire
while
among
the
less
protected
ships
cruiser
after
cruiser
has
been
destroyed
whenever
the
hostile
squadrons
have
gotten
within
range
of
one
anothers
weapons
there
will
always
be
a
large
field
of
usefulness
for
cruisers
especially
of
the
more
formidable
type
we
need
to
increase
the
number
of
torpedoboat
destroyers
paying
less
heed
to
their
having
a
knot
or
two
extra
speed
than
to
their
capacity
to
keep
the
seas
for
weeks
and
if
necessary
for
months
at
a
time
it
is
wise
to
build
submarine
torpedo
boats
as
under
certain
circumstances
they
might
be
very
useful
but
most
of
all
we
need
to
continue
building
our
fleet
of
battle
ships
or
ships
so
powerfully
armed
that
they
can
inflict
the
maximum
of
damage
upon
our
opponents
and
so
well
protected
that
they
can
suffer
a
severe
hammering
in
return
without
fatal
impairment
of
their
ability
to
fight
and
maneuver
of
course
ample
means
must
be
provided
for
enabling
the
personnel
of
the
navy
to
be
brought
to
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
our
great
fighting
ships
and
torpedo
boats
must
be
ceaselessly
trained
and
maneuvered
in
squadrons
the
officers
and
men
can
only
learn
their
trade
thoroughly
by
ceaseless
practice
on
the
high
seas
in
the
event
of
war
it
would
be
far
better
to
have
no
ships
at
all
than
to
have
ships
of
a
poor
and
ineffective
type
or
ships
which
however
good
were
yet
manned
by
untrained
and
unskillful
crews
the
best
officers
and
men
in
a
poor
ship
could
do
nothing
against
fairly
good
opponents
and
on
the
other
hand
a
modern
war
ship
is
useless
unless
the
officers
and
men
aboard
her
have
become
adepts
in
their
duties
the
marksmanship
in
our
navy
has
improved
in
an
extraordinary
degree
during
the
last
three
years
and
on
the
whole
the
types
of
our
battleships
are
improving
but
much
remains
to
be
done
sooner
or
later
we
shall
have
to
provide
for
some
method
by
which
there
will
be
promotions
for
merit
as
well
as
for
seniority
or
else
retirement
all
those
who
after
a
certain
age
have
not
advanced
beyond
a
certain
grade
while
no
effort
must
be
spared
to
make
the
service
attractive
to
the
enlisted
men
in
order
that
they
may
be
kept
as
long
as
possible
in
it
reservation
public
schools
should
be
provided
wherever
there
are
navyyards
within
the
last
three
years
the
united
states
has
set
an
example
in
disarmament
where
disarmament
was
proper
by
law
our
army
is
fixed
at
a
maximum
of
one
hundred
thousand
and
a
minimum
of
sixty
thousand
men
when
there
was
insurrection
in
the
philippines
we
kept
the
army
at
the
maximum
peace
came
in
the
philippines
and
now
our
army
has
been
reduced
to
the
minimum
at
which
it
is
possible
to
keep
it
with
due
regard
to
its
efficiency
the
guns
now
mounted
require
twentyeight
thousand
men
if
the
coast
fortifications
are
to
be
adequately
manned
relatively
to
the
nation
it
is
not
now
so
large
as
the
police
force
of
new
york
or
chicago
relatively
to
the
population
of
either
city
we
need
more
officers
there
are
not
enough
to
perform
the
regular
army
work
it
is
very
important
that
the
officers
of
the
army
should
be
accustomed
to
handle
their
men
in
masses
as
it
is
also
important
that
the
national
guard
of
the
several
states
should
be
accustomed
to
actual
field
maneuvering
especially
in
connection
with
the
regulars
for
this
reason
we
are
to
be
congratulated
upon
the
success
of
the
field
maneuvers
at
manassas
last
fall
maneuvers
in
which
a
larger
number
of
regulars
and
national
guard
took
part
than
was
ever
before
assembled
together
in
time
of
peace
no
other
civilized
nation
has
relatively
to
its
population
such
a
diminutive
army
as
ours
and
while
the
army
is
so
small
we
are
not
to
be
excused
if
we
fail
to
keep
it
at
a
very
high
grade
of
proficiency
it
must
be
incessantly
practiced
the
standard
for
the
enlisted
men
should
be
kept
very
high
while
at
the
same
time
the
service
should
be
made
as
attractive
as
possible
and
the
standard
for
the
officers
should
be
kept
even
higherwhich
as
regards
the
upper
ranks
can
best
be
done
by
introducing
some
system
of
selection
and
rejection
into
the
promotions
we
should
be
able
in
the
event
of
some
sudden
emergency
to
put
into
the
field
one
firstclass
army
corps
which
should
be
as
a
whole
at
least
the
equal
of
any
body
of
troops
of
like
number
belonging
to
any
other
nation
great
progress
has
been
made
in
protecting
our
coasts
by
adequate
fortifications
with
sufficient
guns
we
should
however
pay
much
more
heed
than
at
present
to
the
development
of
an
extensive
system
of
floating
mines
for
use
in
all
our
more
important
harbors
these
mines
have
been
proved
to
be
a
most
formidable
safeguard
against
hostile
fleets
i
earnestly
call
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
need
of
amending
the
existing
law
relating
to
the
award
of
congressional
medals
of
honor
in
the
navy
so
as
to
provide
that
they
may
be
awarded
to
commissioned
officers
and
warrant
officers
as
well
as
to
enlisted
men
these
justly
prized
medals
are
given
in
the
army
alike
to
the
officers
and
the
enlisted
men
and
it
is
most
unjust
that
the
commissioned
officers
and
warrant
officers
of
the
navy
should
not
in
this
respect
have
the
same
rights
as
their
brethren
in
the
army
and
as
the
enlisted
men
of
the
navy
in
the
philippine
islands
there
has
been
during
the
past
year
a
continuation
of
the
steady
progress
which
has
obtained
ever
since
our
troops
definitely
got
the
upper
hand
of
the
insurgents
the
philippine
people
or
to
speak
more
accurately
the
many
tribes
and
even
races
sundered
from
one
another
more
or
less
sharply
who
go
to
make
up
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
contain
many
elements
of
good
and
some
elements
which
we
have
a
right
to
hope
stand
for
progress
at
present
they
are
utterly
incapable
of
existing
in
independence
at
all
or
of
building
up
a
civilization
of
their
own
i
firmly
believe
that
we
can
help
them
to
rise
higher
and
higher
in
the
scale
of
civilization
and
of
capacity
for
selfgovernment
and
i
most
earnestly
hope
that
in
the
end
they
will
be
able
to
stand
if
not
entirely
alone
yet
in
some
such
relation
to
the
united
states
as
cuba
now
stands
this
end
is
not
yet
in
sight
and
it
may
be
indefinitely
postponed
if
our
people
are
foolish
enough
to
turn
the
attention
of
the
filipinos
away
from
the
problems
of
achieving
moral
and
material
prosperity
of
working
for
a
stable
orderly
and
just
government
and
toward
foolish
and
dangerous
intrigues
for
a
complete
independence
for
which
they
are
as
yet
totally
unfit
on
the
other
hand
our
people
must
keep
steadily
before
their
minds
the
fact
that
the
justification
for
our
stay
in
the
philippines
must
ultimately
rest
chiefly
upon
the
good
we
are
able
to
do
in
the
islands
i
do
not
overlook
the
fact
that
in
the
development
of
our
interests
in
the
pacific
ocean
and
along
its
coasts
the
philippines
have
played
and
will
play
an
important
part
and
that
our
interests
have
been
served
in
more
than
one
way
by
the
possession
of
the
islands
but
our
chief
reason
for
continuing
to
hold
them
must
be
that
we
ought
in
good
faith
to
try
to
do
our
share
of
the
worlds
work
and
this
particular
piece
of
work
has
been
imposed
upon
us
by
the
results
of
the
war
with
spain
the
problem
presented
to
us
in
the
philippine
islands
is
akin
to
but
not
exactly
like
the
problems
presented
to
the
other
great
civilized
powers
which
have
possessions
in
the
orient
there
are
points
of
resemblance
in
our
work
to
the
work
which
is
being
done
by
the
british
in
india
and
egypt
by
the
french
in
algiers
by
the
dutch
in
java
by
the
russians
in
turkestan
by
the
japanese
in
formosa
but
more
distinctly
than
any
of
these
powers
we
are
endeavoring
to
develop
the
natives
themselves
so
that
they
shall
take
an
everincreasing
share
in
their
own
government
and
as
far
as
is
prudent
we
are
already
admitting
their
representatives
to
a
governmental
equality
with
our
own
there
are
commissioners
judges
and
governors
in
the
islands
who
are
filipinos
and
who
have
exactly
the
same
share
in
the
government
of
the
islands
as
have
their
colleagues
who
are
americans
while
in
the
lower
ranks
of
course
the
great
majority
of
the
public
servants
are
filipinos
within
two
years
we
shall
be
trying
the
experiment
of
an
elective
lower
house
in
the
philippine
legislature
it
may
be
that
the
filipinos
will
misuse
this
legislature
and
they
certainly
will
misuse
it
if
they
are
misled
by
foolish
persons
here
at
home
into
starting
an
agitation
for
their
own
independence
or
into
any
factious
or
improper
action
in
such
case
they
will
do
themselves
no
good
and
will
stop
for
the
time
being
all
further
effort
to
advance
them
and
give
them
a
greater
share
in
their
own
government
but
if
they
act
with
wisdom
and
selfrestraint
if
they
show
that
they
are
capable
of
electing
a
legislature
which
in
its
turn
is
capable
of
taking
a
sane
and
efficient
part
in
the
actual
work
of
government
they
can
rest
assured
that
a
full
and
increasing
measure
of
recognition
will
be
given
them
above
all
they
should
remember
that
their
prime
needs
are
moral
and
industrial
not
political
it
is
a
good
thing
to
try
the
experiment
of
giving
them
a
legislature
but
it
is
a
far
better
thing
to
give
them
schools
good
roads
railroads
which
will
enable
them
to
get
their
products
to
market
honest
courts
an
honest
and
efficient
constabulary
and
all
that
tends
to
produce
order
peace
fair
dealing
as
between
man
and
man
and
habits
of
intelligent
industry
and
thrift
if
they
are
safeguarded
against
oppression
and
if
their
real
wants
material
and
spiritual
are
studied
intelligently
and
in
a
spirit
of
friendly
sympathy
much
more
good
will
be
done
them
than
by
any
effort
to
give
them
political
power
though
this
effort
may
in
its
own
proper
time
and
place
be
proper
enough
meanwhile
our
own
people
should
remember
that
there
is
need
for
the
highest
standard
of
conduct
among
the
americ
ans
sent
to
the
philippine
islands
not
only
among
the
public
servants
but
among
the
private
individuals
who
go
to
them
it
is
because
i
feel
this
so
deeply
that
in
the
administration
of
these
islands
i
have
positively
refused
to
permit
any
discrimination
whatsoever
for
political
reasons
and
have
insisted
that
in
choosing
the
public
servants
consideration
should
be
paid
solely
to
the
worth
of
the
men
chosen
and
to
the
needs
of
the
islands
there
is
no
higher
body
of
men
in
our
public
service
than
we
have
in
the
philippine
islands
under
governor
wright
and
his
associates
so
far
as
possible
these
men
should
be
given
a
free
hand
and
their
suggestions
should
receive
the
hearty
backing
both
of
the
executive
and
of
the
congress
there
is
need
of
a
vigilant
and
disinterested
support
of
our
public
servants
in
the
philippines
by
good
citizens
here
in
the
united
states
unfortunately
hitherto
those
of
our
people
here
at
home
who
have
specially
claimed
to
be
the
champions
of
the
filipinos
have
in
reality
been
their
worst
enemies
this
will
continue
to
be
the
case
as
long
as
they
strive
to
make
the
filipinos
independent
and
stop
all
industrial
development
of
the
islands
by
crying
out
against
the
laws
which
would
bring
it
on
the
ground
that
capitalists
must
not
exploit
the
islands
such
proceedings
are
not
only
unwise
but
are
most
harmful
to
the
filipinos
who
do
not
need
independence
at
all
but
who
do
need
good
laws
good
public
servants
and
the
industrial
development
that
can
only
come
if
the
investment
of
american
and
foreign
capital
in
the
islands
is
favored
in
all
legitimate
ways
every
measure
taken
concerning
the
islands
should
be
taken
primarily
with
a
view
to
their
advantage
we
should
certainly
give
them
lower
tariff
rates
on
their
exports
to
the
united
states
if
this
is
not
done
it
will
be
a
wrong
to
extend
our
shipping
laws
to
them
i
earnestly
hope
for
the
immediate
enactment
into
law
of
the
legislation
now
pending
to
encourage
american
capital
to
seek
investment
in
the
islands
in
railroads
in
factories
in
plantations
and
in
lumbering
and
mining

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
country
is
to
be
congratulated
on
the
amount
of
substantial
achievement
which
has
marked
the
past
year
both
as
regards
our
foreign
and
as
regards
our
domestic
policy
with
a
nation
as
with
a
man
the
most
important
things
are
those
of
the
household
and
therefore
the
country
is
especially
to
be
congratulated
on
what
has
been
accomplished
in
the
direction
of
providing
for
the
exercise
of
supervision
over
the
great
corporations
and
combinations
of
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
the
congress
has
created
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
including
the
bureau
of
corporations
with
for
the
first
time
authority
to
secure
proper
publicity
of
such
proceedings
of
these
great
corporations
as
the
public
has
the
right
to
know
it
has
provided
for
the
expediting
of
suits
for
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
antitrust
law
and
by
another
law
it
has
secured
equal
treatment
to
all
producers
in
the
transportation
of
their
goods
thus
taking
a
long
stride
forward
in
making
effective
the
work
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
establishment
of
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
with
the
bureau
of
corporations
thereunder
marks
a
real
advance
in
the
direction
of
doing
all
that
is
possible
for
the
solution
of
the
questions
vitally
affecting
capitalists
and
wageworkers
the
act
creating
department
was
approved
on
february
and
two
days
later
the
head
of
the
department
was
nominated
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
since
then
the
work
of
organization
has
been
pushed
as
rapidly
as
the
initial
appropriations
permitted
and
with
due
regard
to
thoroughness
and
the
broad
purposes
which
the
department
is
designed
to
serve
after
the
transfer
of
the
various
bureaus
and
branches
to
the
department
at
the
beginning
of
the
current
fiscal
year
as
provided
for
in
the
act
the
personnel
comprised
employees
in
washington
and
in
the
country
at
large
the
scope
of
the
departments
duty
and
authority
embraces
the
commercial
and
industrial
interests
of
the
nation
it
is
not
designed
to
restrict
or
control
the
fullest
liberty
of
legitimate
business
action
but
to
secure
exact
and
authentic
information
which
will
aid
the
executive
in
enforcing
existing
laws
and
which
will
enable
the
congress
to
enact
additional
legislation
if
any
should
be
found
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
few
from
obtaining
privileges
at
the
expense
of
diminished
opportunities
for
the
many
the
preliminary
work
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
in
the
department
has
shown
the
wisdom
of
its
creation
publicity
in
corporate
affairs
will
tend
to
do
away
with
ignorance
and
will
afford
facts
upon
which
intelligent
action
may
be
taken
systematic
intelligent
investigation
is
already
developing
facts
the
knowledge
of
which
is
essential
to
a
right
understanding
of
the
needs
and
duties
of
the
business
world
the
corporation
which
is
honestly
and
fairly
organized
whose
managers
in
the
conduct
of
its
business
recognize
their
obligation
to
deal
squarely
with
their
stockholders
their
competitors
and
the
public
has
nothing
to
fear
from
such
supervision
the
purpose
of
this
bureau
is
not
to
embarrass
or
assail
legitimate
business
but
to
aid
in
bringing
about
a
better
industrial
conditiona
condition
under
which
there
shall
be
obedience
to
law
and
recognition
of
public
obligation
by
all
corporations
great
or
small
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
will
be
not
only
the
clearing
house
for
information
regarding
the
business
transactions
of
the
nation
but
the
executive
arm
of
the
government
to
aid
in
strengthening
our
domestic
and
foreign
markets
in
perfecting
our
transportation
facilities
in
building
up
our
merchant
marine
in
preventing
the
entrance
of
undesirable
immigrants
in
improving
commercial
and
industrial
conditions
and
in
bringing
together
on
common
ground
those
necessary
partners
in
industrial
progresscapital
and
labor
commerce
between
the
nations
is
steadily
growing
in
volume
and
the
tendency
of
the
times
is
toward
closer
trade
relations
constant
watchfulness
is
needed
to
secure
to
americans
the
chance
to
participate
to
the
best
advantage
in
foreign
trade
and
we
may
confidently
expect
that
the
new
department
will
justify
the
expectation
of
its
creators
by
the
exercise
of
this
watchfulness
as
well
as
by
the
businesslike
administration
of
such
laws
relating
to
our
internal
affairs
as
are
intrusted
to
its
care
in
enacting
the
laws
above
enumerated
the
congress
proceeded
on
sane
and
conservative
lines
nothing
revolutionary
was
attempted
but
a
commonsense
and
successful
effort
was
made
in
the
direction
of
seeing
that
corporations
are
so
handled
as
to
subserve
the
public
good
the
legislation
was
moderate
it
was
characterized
throughout
by
the
idea
that
we
were
not
attacking
corporations
but
endeavoring
to
provide
for
doing
away
with
any
evil
in
them
that
we
drew
the
line
against
misconduct
not
against
wealth
gladly
recognizing
the
great
good
done
by
the
capitalist
who
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
his
fellows
does
his
work
along
proper
and
legitimate
lines
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
which
purpose
will
undoubtedly
be
fulfilled
was
to
favor
such
a
man
when
he
does
well
and
to
supervise
his
action
only
to
prevent
him
from
doing
ill
publicity
can
do
no
harm
to
the
honest
corporation
the
only
corporation
that
has
cause
to
dread
it
is
the
corporation
which
shrinks
from
the
light
and
about
the
welfare
of
such
corporations
we
need
not
be
oversensitive
the
work
of
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
has
been
conditioned
upon
this
theory
of
securing
fair
treatment
alike
for
labor
and
for
capital
the
consistent
policy
of
the
national
government
so
far
as
it
has
the
power
is
to
hold
in
check
the
unscrupulous
man
whether
employer
or
employee
but
to
refuse
to
weaken
individual
initiative
or
to
hamper
or
cramp
the
industrial
development
of
the
country
we
recognize
that
this
is
an
era
of
federation
and
combination
in
which
great
capitalistic
corporations
and
labor
unions
have
become
factors
of
tremendous
importance
in
all
industrial
centers
hearty
recognition
is
given
the
farreaching
beneficent
work
which
has
been
accomplished
through
both
corporations
and
unions
and
the
line
as
between
different
corporations
as
between
different
unions
is
drawn
as
it
is
between
different
individuals
that
is
it
is
drawn
on
conduct
the
effort
being
to
treat
both
organized
capital
and
organized
labor
alike
asking
nothing
save
that
the
interest
of
each
shall
be
brought
into
harmony
with
the
interest
of
the
general
public
and
that
the
conduct
of
each
shall
conform
to
the
fundamental
rules
of
obedience
to
law
of
individual
freedom
and
of
justice
and
fair
dealing
towards
all
whenever
either
corporation
labor
union
or
individual
disregards
the
law
or
acts
in
a
spirit
of
arbitrary
and
tyrannous
interference
with
the
rights
of
others
whether
corporations
or
individuals
then
where
the
federal
government
has
jurisdiction
it
will
see
to
it
that
the
misconduct
is
stopped
paying
not
the
slightest
heed
to
the
position
or
power
of
the
corporation
the
union
or
the
individual
but
only
to
one
vital
factthat
is
the
question
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
individual
or
aggregate
of
individuals
is
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
land
every
man
must
be
guaranteed
his
liberty
and
his
right
to
do
as
he
likes
with
his
property
or
his
labor
so
long
as
he
does
not
infringe
the
rights
of
others
no
man
is
above
the
law
and
no
man
is
below
it
nor
do
we
ask
any
mans
permission
when
we
require
him
to
obey
it
obedience
to
the
law
is
demanded
as
a
right
not
asked
as
a
favor
we
have
cause
as
a
nation
to
be
thankful
for
the
steps
that
have
been
so
successfully
taken
to
put
these
principles
into
effect
the
progress
has
been
by
evolution
not
by
revolution
nothing
radical
has
been
done
the
action
has
been
both
moderate
and
resolute
therefore
the
work
will
stand
there
shall
be
no
backward
step
if
in
the
working
of
the
laws
it
proves
desirable
that
they
shall
at
any
point
be
expanded
or
amplified
the
amendment
can
be
made
as
its
desirability
is
shown
meanwhile
they
are
being
administered
with
judgment
but
with
insistence
upon
obedience
to
them
and
their
need
has
been
emphasized
in
signal
fashion
by
the
events
of
the
past
year
from
all
sources
exclusive
of
the
postal
service
the
receipts
of
the
government
for
the
last
fiscal
year
aggregated
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
the
surplus
for
the
fiscal
year
being
the
indications
are
that
the
surplus
for
the
present
fiscal
year
will
be
very
small
if
indeed
there
be
any
surplus
from
july
to
november
the
receipts
from
customs
were
approximately
nine
million
dollars
less
than
the
receipts
from
the
same
source
for
a
corresponding
portion
of
last
year
should
this
decrease
continue
at
the
same
ratio
throughout
the
fiscal
year
the
surplus
would
be
reduced
by
approximately
thirty
million
dollars
should
the
revenue
from
customs
suffer
much
further
decrease
during
the
fiscal
year
the
surplus
would
vanish
a
large
surplus
is
certainly
undesirable
two
years
ago
the
war
taxes
were
taken
off
with
the
express
intention
of
equalizing
the
governmental
receipts
and
expenditures
and
though
the
first
year
thereafter
still
showed
a
surplus
it
now
seems
likely
that
a
substantial
equality
of
revenue
and
expenditure
will
be
attained
such
being
the
case
it
is
of
great
moment
both
to
exercise
care
and
economy
in
appropriations
and
to
scan
sharply
any
change
in
our
fiscal
revenue
system
which
may
reduce
our
income
the
need
of
strict
economy
in
our
expenditures
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
we
can
not
afford
to
be
parsimonious
in
providing
for
what
is
essential
to
our
national
wellbeing
careful
economy
wherever
possible
will
alone
prevent
our
income
from
falling
below
the
point
required
in
order
to
meet
our
genuine
needs
the
integrity
of
our
currency
is
beyond
question
and
under
present
conditions
it
would
be
unwise
and
unnecessary
to
attempt
a
reconstruction
of
our
entire
monetary
system
the
same
liberty
should
be
granted
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
deposit
customs
receipts
as
is
gran
ted
him
in
the
deposit
of
receipts
from
other
sources
in
my
message
of
december
i
called
attention
to
certain
needs
of
the
financial
situation
and
i
again
ask
the
consideration
of
the
congress
for
these
questions
during
the
last
session
of
the
congress
at
the
suggestion
of
a
joint
note
from
the
republic
of
mexico
and
the
imperial
government
of
china
and
in
harmony
with
an
act
of
the
congress
appropriating
to
pay
the
expenses
thereof
a
commission
was
appointed
to
confer
with
the
principal
european
countries
in
the
hope
that
some
plan
might
be
devised
whereby
a
fixed
rate
of
exchange
could
be
assured
between
the
goldstandard
countries
and
the
silverstandard
countries
this
commission
has
filed
its
preliminary
report
which
has
been
made
public
i
deem
it
important
that
the
commission
be
continued
and
that
a
sum
of
money
be
appropriated
sufficient
to
pay
the
expenses
of
its
further
labors
a
majority
of
our
people
desire
that
steps
be
taken
in
the
interests
of
american
shipping
so
that
we
may
once
more
resume
our
former
position
in
the
ocean
carrying
trade
but
hitherto
the
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
proper
method
of
reaching
this
end
have
been
so
wide
that
it
has
proved
impossible
to
secure
the
adoption
of
any
particular
scheme
having
in
view
these
facts
i
recommend
that
the
congress
direct
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
postmastergeneral
and
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
associated
with
such
a
representation
from
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
as
the
congress
in
its
wisdom
may
designate
to
serve
as
a
commission
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
and
reporting
to
the
congress
at
its
next
session
what
legislation
is
desirable
or
necessary
for
the
development
of
the
american
merchant
marine
and
american
commerce
and
incidentally
of
a
national
ocean
mail
service
of
adequate
auxiliary
naval
crusiers
and
naval
reserves
while
such
a
measure
is
desirable
in
any
event
it
is
especially
desirable
at
this
time
in
view
of
the
fact
that
our
present
governmental
contract
for
ocean
mail
with
the
american
line
will
expire
in
our
ocean
mail
act
was
passed
in
in
our
knot
transatlantic
mail
line
was
equal
to
any
foreign
line
since
then
the
germans
have
put
on
knot
steamers
and
the
british
have
contracted
for
knot
steamers
our
service
should
equal
the
best
if
it
does
not
the
commercial
public
will
abandon
it
if
we
are
to
stay
in
the
business
it
ought
to
be
with
a
full
understanding
of
the
advantages
to
the
country
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
with
exact
knowledge
of
the
cost
and
proper
methods
of
carrying
it
on
moreover
lines
of
cargo
ships
are
of
even
more
importance
than
fast
mail
lines
save
so
far
as
the
latter
can
be
depended
upon
to
furnish
swift
auxiliary
cruisers
in
time
of
war
the
establishment
of
new
lines
of
cargo
ships
to
south
america
to
asia
and
elsewhere
would
be
much
in
the
interest
of
our
commercial
expansion
we
can
not
have
too
much
immigration
of
the
right
kind
and
we
should
have
none
at
all
of
the
wrong
kind
the
need
is
to
devise
some
system
by
which
undesirable
immigrants
shall
be
kept
out
entirely
while
desirable
immigrants
are
properly
distributed
throughout
the
country
at
present
some
districts
which
need
immigrants
have
none
and
in
others
where
the
population
is
already
congested
immigrants
come
in
such
numbers
as
to
depress
the
conditions
of
life
for
those
already
there
during
the
last
two
years
the
immigration
service
at
new
york
has
been
greatly
improved
and
the
corruption
and
inefficiency
which
formerly
obtained
there
have
been
eradicated
this
service
has
just
been
investigated
by
a
committee
of
new
york
citizens
of
high
standing
messrs
arthur
v
briesen
lee
k
frankel
eugene
a
philbin
thomas
w
hynes
and
ralph
trautman
their
report
deals
with
the
whole
situation
at
length
and
concludes
with
certain
recommendations
for
administrative
and
legislative
action
it
is
now
receiving
the
attention
of
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
the
special
investigation
of
the
subject
of
naturalization
under
the
direction
of
the
attorneygeneral
and
the
consequent
prosecutions
reveal
a
condition
of
affairs
calling
for
the
immediate
attention
of
the
congress
forgeries
and
perjuries
of
shameless
and
flagrant
character
have
been
perpetrated
not
only
in
the
dense
centers
of
population
but
throughout
the
country
and
it
is
established
beyond
doubt
that
very
many
socalled
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
no
title
whatever
to
that
right
and
are
asserting
and
enjoying
the
benefits
of
the
same
through
the
grossest
frauds
it
is
never
to
be
forgotten
that
citizenship
is
to
quote
the
words
recently
used
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
an
inestimable
heritage
whether
it
proceeds
from
birth
within
the
country
or
is
obtained
by
naturalization
and
we
poison
the
sources
of
our
national
character
and
strength
at
the
fountain
if
the
privilege
is
claimed
and
exercised
without
right
and
by
means
of
fraud
and
corruption
the
body
politic
can
not
be
sound
and
healthy
if
many
of
its
constituent
members
claim
their
standing
through
the
prostitution
of
the
high
right
and
calling
of
citizenship
it
should
mean
something
to
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
process
no
loophole
whatever
should
be
left
open
to
fraud
the
methods
by
which
these
fraudsnow
under
full
investigation
with
a
view
to
meting
out
punishment
and
providing
adequate
remediesare
perpetrated
include
many
variations
of
procedure
by
which
false
certificates
of
citizenship
are
forged
in
their
entirety
or
genuine
certificates
fraudulently
or
collusively
obtained
in
blank
are
filled
in
by
the
criminal
conspirators
or
certificates
are
obtained
on
fraudulent
statements
as
to
the
time
of
arrival
and
residence
in
this
country
or
imposition
and
substitution
of
another
party
for
the
real
petitioner
occur
in
court
or
certificates
are
made
the
subject
of
barter
and
sale
and
transferred
from
the
rightful
holder
to
those
not
entitled
to
them
or
certificates
are
forged
by
erasure
of
the
original
names
and
the
insertion
of
the
names
of
other
persons
not
entitled
to
the
same
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
refer
here
at
large
to
the
causes
leading
to
this
state
of
affairs
the
desire
for
naturalization
is
heartily
to
be
commended
where
it
springs
from
a
sincere
and
permanent
intention
to
become
citizens
and
a
real
appreciation
of
the
privilege
but
it
is
a
source
of
untold
evil
and
trouble
where
it
is
traceable
to
selfish
and
dishonest
motives
such
as
the
effort
by
artificial
and
improper
means
in
wholesale
fashion
to
create
voters
who
are
readymade
tools
of
corrupt
politicians
or
the
desire
to
evade
certain
labor
laws
creating
discriminations
against
alien
labor
all
good
citizens
whether
naturalized
or
native
born
are
equally
interested
in
protecting
our
citizenship
against
fraud
in
any
form
and
on
the
other
hand
in
affording
every
facility
for
naturalization
to
those
who
in
good
faith
desire
to
share
alike
our
privileges
and
our
responsibilities
the
federal
grand
jury
lately
in
session
in
new
york
city
dealt
with
this
subject
and
made
a
presentment
which
states
the
situation
briefly
and
forcibly
and
contains
important
suggestions
for
the
consideration
of
the
congress
this
presentment
is
included
as
an
appendix
to
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
in
my
last
annual
message
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
the
due
regulation
of
combinations
of
capital
which
are
or
may
become
injurious
to
the
public
i
recommend
a
special
appropriation
for
the
better
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
law
as
it
now
stands
to
be
extended
under
the
direction
of
the
attorneygeneral
accordingly
by
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
appropriation
act
of
february
stat
the
congress
appropriated
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
various
federal
trust
and
interstatecommerce
laws
the
sum
of
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
be
expended
under
the
direction
of
the
attorneygeneral
in
the
employment
of
special
counsel
and
agents
in
the
department
of
justice
to
conduct
proceedings
and
prosecutions
under
said
laws
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
i
now
recommend
as
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
and
urgency
the
extension
of
the
purposes
of
this
appropriation
so
that
it
may
be
available
under
the
direction
of
the
attorneygeneral
and
until
used
for
the
due
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
general
and
especially
of
the
civil
and
criminal
laws
relating
to
public
lands
and
the
laws
relating
to
postal
crimes
and
offenses
and
the
subject
of
naturalization
recent
investigations
have
shown
a
deplorable
state
of
affairs
in
these
three
matters
of
vital
concern
by
various
frauds
and
by
forgeries
and
perjuries
thousands
of
acres
of
the
public
domain
embracing
lands
of
different
character
and
extending
through
various
sections
of
the
country
have
been
dishonestly
acquired
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
urge
the
importance
of
recovering
these
dishonest
acquisitions
stolen
from
the
people
and
of
promptly
and
duly
punishing
the
offenders
i
speak
in
another
part
of
this
message
of
the
widespread
crimes
by
which
the
sacred
right
of
citizenship
is
falsely
asserted
and
that
inestimable
heritage
perverted
to
base
ends
by
similar
meansthat
is
through
frauds
forgeries
and
perjuries
and
by
shameless
briberiesthe
laws
relating
to
the
proper
conduct
of
the
public
service
in
general
and
to
the
due
administration
of
the
postoffice
department
have
been
notoriously
violated
and
many
indictments
have
been
found
and
the
consequent
prosecutions
are
in
course
of
hearing
or
on
the
eve
thereof
for
the
reasons
thus
indicated
and
so
that
the
government
may
be
prepared
to
enforce
promptly
and
with
the
greatest
effect
the
due
penalties
for
such
violations
of
law
and
to
this
end
may
be
furnished
with
sufficient
instrumentalities
and
competent
legal
assistance
for
the
investigations
and
trials
which
will
be
necessary
at
many
different
points
of
the
country
i
urge
upon
the
congress
the
necessity
of
making
the
said
appropriation
available
for
immediate
use
for
all
such
purposes
to
be
expended
under
the
direction
of
the
attorneygeneral
s
teps
have
been
taken
by
the
state
department
looking
to
the
making
of
bribery
an
extraditable
offense
with
foreign
powers
the
need
of
more
effective
treaties
covering
this
crime
is
manifest
the
exposures
and
prosecutions
of
official
corruption
in
st
louis
mo
and
other
cities
and
states
have
resulted
in
a
number
of
givers
and
takers
of
bribes
becoming
fugitives
in
foreign
lands
bribery
has
not
been
included
in
extradition
treaties
heretofore
as
the
necessity
for
it
has
not
arisen
while
there
may
have
been
as
much
official
corruption
in
former
years
there
has
been
more
developed
and
brought
to
light
in
the
immediate
past
than
in
the
preceding
century
of
our
countrys
history
it
should
be
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
leave
no
place
on
earth
where
a
corrupt
man
fleeing
from
this
country
can
rest
in
peace
there
is
no
reason
why
bribery
should
not
be
included
in
all
treaties
as
extraditable
the
recent
amended
treaty
with
mexico
whereby
this
crime
was
put
in
the
list
of
extraditable
offenses
has
established
a
salutary
precedent
in
this
regard
under
this
treaty
the
state
department
has
asked
and
mexico
has
granted
the
extradition
of
one
of
the
st
louis
bribe
givers
there
can
be
no
crime
more
serious
than
bribery
other
offenses
violate
one
law
while
corruption
strikes
at
the
foundation
of
all
law
under
our
form
of
government
all
authority
is
vested
in
the
people
and
by
them
delegated
to
those
who
represent
them
in
official
capacity
there
can
be
no
offense
heavier
than
that
of
him
in
whom
such
a
sacred
trust
has
been
reposed
who
sells
it
for
his
own
gain
and
enrichment
and
no
less
heavy
is
the
offense
of
the
bribe
giver
he
is
worse
than
the
thief
for
the
thief
robs
the
individual
while
the
corrupt
official
plunders
an
entire
city
or
state
he
is
as
wicked
as
the
murderer
for
the
murderer
may
only
take
one
life
against
the
law
while
the
corrupt
official
and
the
man
who
corrupts
the
official
alike
aim
at
the
assassination
of
the
commonwealth
itself
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
will
perish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
if
bribery
is
tolerated
the
givers
and
takers
of
bribes
stand
on
an
evil
preeminence
of
infamy
the
exposure
and
punishment
of
public
corruption
is
an
honor
to
a
nation
not
a
disgrace
the
shame
lies
in
toleration
not
in
correction
no
city
or
state
still
less
the
nation
can
be
injured
by
the
enforcement
of
law
as
long
as
public
plunderers
when
detected
can
find
a
haven
of
refuge
in
any
foreign
land
and
avoid
punishment
just
so
long
encouragement
is
given
them
to
continue
their
practices
if
we
fail
to
do
all
that
in
us
lies
to
stamp
out
corruption
we
can
not
escape
our
share
of
responsibility
for
the
guilt
the
first
requisite
of
successful
selfgovernment
is
unflinching
enforcement
of
the
law
and
the
cutting
out
of
corruption
for
several
years
past
the
rapid
development
of
alaska
and
the
establishment
of
growing
american
interests
in
regions
theretofore
unsurveyed
and
imperfectly
known
brought
into
prominence
the
urgent
necessity
of
a
practical
demarcation
of
the
boundaries
between
the
jurisdictions
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain
although
the
treaty
of
between
great
britain
and
russia
the
provisions
of
which
were
copied
in
the
treaty
of
whereby
russia
conveyed
alaska
to
the
united
states
was
positive
as
to
the
control
first
by
russia
and
later
by
the
united
states
of
a
strip
of
territory
along
the
continental
mainland
from
the
western
shore
of
portland
canal
to
mount
st
elias
following
and
surrounding
the
indentations
of
the
coast
and
including
the
islands
to
the
westward
its
description
of
the
landward
margin
of
the
strip
was
indefinite
resting
on
the
supposed
existence
of
a
continuous
ridge
or
range
of
mountains
skirting
the
coast
as
figured
in
the
charts
of
the
early
navigators
it
had
at
no
time
been
possible
for
either
party
in
interest
to
lay
down
under
the
authority
of
the
treaty
a
line
so
obviously
exact
according
to
its
provisions
as
to
command
the
assent
of
the
other
for
nearly
threefourths
of
a
century
the
absence
of
tangible
local
interests
demanding
the
exercise
of
positive
jurisdiction
on
either
side
of
the
border
left
the
question
dormant
in
questions
of
revenue
administration
on
the
stikine
river
led
to
the
establishment
of
a
provisional
demarcation
crossing
the
channel
between
two
high
peaks
on
either
side
about
twentyfour
miles
above
the
river
mouth
in
similar
questions
growing
out
of
the
extraordinary
development
of
mining
interests
in
the
region
about
the
head
of
lynn
canal
brought
about
a
temporary
modus
vivendi
by
which
a
convenient
separation
was
made
at
the
watershed
divides
of
the
white
and
chilkoot
passes
and
to
the
north
of
klukwan
on
the
klehini
river
these
partial
and
tentative
adjustments
could
not
in
the
very
nature
of
things
be
satisfactory
or
lasting
a
permanent
disposition
of
the
matter
became
imperative
after
unavailing
attempts
to
reach
an
understanding
through
a
joint
high
commission
followed
by
prolonged
negotiations
conducted
in
an
amicable
spirit
a
convention
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
was
signed
january
providing
for
an
examination
of
the
subject
by
a
mixed
tribunal
of
six
members
three
on
a
side
with
a
view
to
its
final
disposition
ratifications
were
exchanged
on
march
last
whereupon
the
two

appointed

marked
by
a

and
conscientious
spirit
the

presented

issues

reached
and
signed
an
agreement
on
all
the
questions
submitted
by
the
terms
of
the
convention
by
this
award
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
the
control
of
a
continuous
strip
or
border
of
the
mainland
shore
skirting
all
the
tidewater
inlets
and
sinuosities
of
the
coast
is
confirmed
the
entrance
to
portland
canal
concerning
which
legitimate
doubt
appeared
is
defined
as
passing
by
tongass
inlet
and
to
the
northwestward
of
wales
and
pearse
islands
a
line
is
drawn
from
the
head
of
portland
canal
to
the
fiftysixth
degree
of
north
latitude
and
the
interior
border
line
of
the
strip
is
fixed
by
lines
connecting
certain
mountain
summits
lying
between
portland
canal
and
mount
st

and
running
along
the
crest
of
the
divide
separating
the
coast
slope
from
the
inland
watershed
at
the
only
part
of
the
frontier
where
the
drainage
ridge
approaches
the
coast
within
the
distance
of
ten

leagues
stipulated
by
the
treaty
as
the
extreme
width
of
the
strip
around
the
heads
of

its
branches
while
the
line
so
traced
follows
the
provisional
demarcation

crossing
of

that
of
at
the
summits

passes
it
runs
much
farther
inland
from
the
klehini
than
the
temporary
line
of
the
later
modus
vivendi
and
leaves
the
entire
mining
district
of
the
porcupine
river
and
glacier
creek
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
the
result
is
satisfactory
in
every
way
it
is
of
great
material
advantage
to
our
people
in
the
far
northwest
it
has
removed
from
the
field
of
discussion
and
possible
danger
a
question
liable
to
become
more
acutely
accentuated
with
each
passing
year
finally
it
has
furnished
a
signal
proof
of
the
fairness
and
good
will
with
which
two
friendly
nations
can
approach
and
determine
issues
involving
national
sovereignty
and
by
their
nature
incapable
of
submission
to
a
third
power
for
adjudication
the
award
is
selfexecuting
on
the
vital
points
to
make
it
effective
as
regards
the
others
it
only
remains
for
the
two
governments
to
appoint
each
on
its
own
behalf
one
or
more
scientific
experts
who
shall
with
all
convenient
speed
proceed
together
to
lay
down
the
boundary
line
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
majority
of
the
tribunal
i
recommend
that
the
congress
make
adequate
provision
for
the
appointment
compensation
and
expenses
of
the
members
to
serve
on
this
joint
boundary
commission
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
it
will
be
remembered
that
during
the
second
session
of
the
last
congress
great
britain
germany
and
italy
formed
an
alliance
for
the
purpose
of
blockading
the
ports
of
venezuela
and
using
such
other
means
of
pressure
as
would
secure
a
settlement
of
claims
due
as
they
alleged
to
certain
of
their
subjects
their
employment
of
force
for
the
collection
of
these
claims
was
terminated
by
an
agreement
brought
about
through
the
offices
of
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
united
states
at
caracas
and
the
government
at
washington
thereby
ending
a
situation
which
was
bound
to
cause
increasing
friction
and
which
jeoparded
the
peace
of
the
continent
under
this
agreement
venezuela
agreed
to
set
apart
a
certain
percentage
of
the
customs
receipts
of
two
of
her
ports
to
be
applied
to
the
payment
of
whatever
obligations
might
be
ascertained
by
mixed
commissions
appointed
for
that
purpose
to
be
due
from
her
not
only
to
the
three
powers
already
mentioned
whose
proceedings
against
her
had
resulted
in
a
state
of
war
but
also
to
the
united
states
france
spain
belgium
the
netherland
sweden
and
norway
and
mexico
who
had
not
employed
force
for
the
collection
of
the
claims
alleged
to
be
due
to
certain
of
their
citizens
a
demand
was
then
made
by
the
socalled
blockading
powers
that
the
sums
ascertained
to
be
due
to
their
citizens
by
such
mixed
commissions
should
be
accorded
payment
in
full
before
anything
was
paid
upon
the
claims
of
any
of
the
socalled
peace
powers
venezuela
on
the
other
hand
insisted
that
all
her
creditors
should
be
paid
upon
a
basis
of
exact
equality
during
the
e
fforts
to
adjust
this
dispute
it
was
suggested
by
the
powers
in
interest
that
it
should
be
referred
to
me
for
decision
but
i
was
clearly
of
the
opinion
that
a
far
wiser
course
would
be
to
submit
the
question
to
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
at
the
hague
it
seemed
to
me
to
offer
an
admirable
opportunity
to
advance
the
practice
of
the
peaceful
settlement
of
disputes
between
nations
and
to
secure
for
the
hague
tribunal
a
memorable
increase
of
its
practical
importance
the
nations
interested
in
the
controversy
were
so
numerous
and
in
many
instances
so
powerful
as
to
make
it
evident
that
beneficent
results
would
follow
from
their
appearance
at
the
same
time
before
the
bar
of
that
august
tribunal
of
peace
our
hopes
in
that
regard
have
been
realized
russia
and
austria
are
represented
in
the
persons
of
the
learned
and
distinguished
jurists
who
compose
the
tribunal
while
great
britain
germany
france
spain
italy
belgium
the
netherlands
sweden
and
norway
mexico
the
united
states
and
venezuela
are
represented
by
their
respective
agents
and
counsel
such
an
imposing
concourse
of
nations
presenting
their
arguments
to
and
invoking
the
decision
of
that
high
court
of
international
justice
and
international
peace
can
hardly
fail
to
secure
a
like
submission
of
many
future
controversies
the
nations
now
appearing
there
will
find
it
far
easier
to
appear
there
a
second
time
while
no
nation
can
imagine
its
just
pride
will
be
lessened
by
following
the
example
now
presented
this
triumph
of
the
principle
of
international
arbitration
is
a
subject
of
warm
congratulation
and
offers
a
happy
augury
for
the
peace
of
the
world
there
seems
good
ground
for
the
belief
that
there
has
been
a
real
growth
among
the
civilized
nations
of
a
sentiment
which
will
permit
a
gradual
substitution
of
other
methods
than
the
method
of
war
in
the
settlement
of
disputes
it
is
not
pretended
that
as
yet
we
are
near
a
position
in
which
it
will
be
possible
wholly
to
prevent
war
or
that
a
just
regard
for
national
interest
and
honor
will
in
all
cases
permit
of
the
settlement
of
international
disputes
by
arbitration
but
by
a
mixture
of
prudence
and
firmness
with
wisdom
we
think
it
is
possible
to
do
away
with
much
of
the
provocation
and
excuse
for
war
and
at
least
in
many
cases
to
substitute
some
other
and
more
rational
method
for
the
settlement
of
disputes
the
hague
court
offers
so
good
an
example
of
what
can
be
done
in
the
direction
of
such
settlement
that
it
should
be
encouraged
in
every
way
further
steps
should
be
taken
in
president
mckinleys
annual
message
of
december
he
made
the
following
recommendation
the
experiences
of
the
last
year
bring
forcibly
home
to
us
a
sense
of
the
burdens
and
the
waste
of
war
we
desire
in
common
with
most
civilized
nations
to
reduce
to
the
lowest
possible
point
the
damage
sustained
in
time
of
war
by
peaceable
trade
and
commerce
it
is
true
we
may
suffer
in
such
cases
less
than
other
communities
but
all
nations
are
damaged
more
or
less
by
the
state
of
uneasiness
and
apprehension
into
which
an
outbreak
of
hostilities
throws
the
entire
commercial
world
it
should
be
our
object
therefore
to
minimize
so
far
as
practicable
this
inevitable
loss
and
disturbance
this
purpose
can
probably
best
be
accomplished
by
an
international
agreement
to
regard
all
private
property
at
sea
as
exempt
from
capture
or
destruction
by
the
forces
of
belligerent
powers
the
united
states
government
has
for
many
years
advocated
this
humane
and
beneficent
principle
and
is
now
in
a
position
to
recommend
it
to
other
powers
without
the
imputation
of
selfish
motives
i
therefore
suggest
for
your
consideration
that
the
executive
be
authorized
to
correspond
with
the
governments
of
the
principal
maritime
powers
with
a
view
of
incorporating
into
the
permanent
law
of
civilized
nations
the
principle
of
the
exemption
of
all
private
property
at
sea
not
contraband
of
war
from
capture
or
destruction
by
belligerent
powers
i
cordially
renew
this
recommendation
the
supreme
court
speaking
on
december
through
peckham
j
said
it
is
we
think
historically
accurate
to
say
that
this
government
has
always
been
in
its
views
among
the
most
advanced
of
the
governments
of
the
world
in
favor
of
mitigating
as
to
all
noncombatants
the
hardships
and
horrors
of
war
to
accomplish
that
object
it
has
always
advocated
those
rules
which
would
in
most
cases
do
away
with
the
right
to
capture
the
private
property
of
an
enemy
on
the
high
seas
i
advocate
this
as
a
matter
of
humanity
and
morals
it
is
anachronistic
when
private
property
is
respected
on
land
that
it
should
not
be
respected
at
sea
moreover
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
shipping
represents
internationally
speaking
a
much
more
generalized
species
of
private
property
than
is
the
case
with
ordinary
property
on
landthat
is
property
found
at
sea
is
much
less
apt
than
is
the
case
with
property
found
on
land
really
to
belong
to
any
one
nation
under
the
modern
system
of
corporate
ownership
the
flag
of
a
vessel
often
differs
from
the
flag
which
would
mark
the
nationality
of
the
real
ownership
and
money
control
of
the
vessel
and
the
cargo
may
belong
to
individuals
of
yet
a
different
nationality
much
american
capital
is
now
invested
in
foreign
ships
and
among
foreign
nations
it
often
happens
that
the
capital
of
one
is
largely
invested
in
the
shipping
of
another
furthermore
as
a
practical
matter
it
may
be
mentioned
that
while
commerce
destroying
may
cause
serious
loss
and
great
annoyance
it
can
never
be
more
than
a
subsidiary
factor
in
bringing
to
terms
a
resolute
foe
this
is
now
well
recognized
by
all
of
our
naval
experts
the
fighting
ship
not
the
commerce
destroyer
is
the
vessel
whose
feats
add
renown
to
a
nations
history
and
establish
her
place
among
the
great
powers
of
the
world
last
year
the
interparliamentary
union
for
international
arbitration
met
at
vienna
six
hundred
members
of
the
different
legislatures
of
civilized
countries
attending
it
was
provided
that
the
next
meeting
should
be
in
at
st
louis
subject
to
our
congress
extending
an
invitation
like
the
hague
tribunal
this
interparliamentary
union
is
one
of
the
forces
tending
towards
peace
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
it
is
entitled
to
our
support
i
trust
the
invitation
can
be
extended
early
in
july
having
received
intelligence
which
happily
turned
out
to
be
erroneous
of
the
assassination
of
our
viceconsul
at
beirut
i
dispatched
a
small
squadron
to
that
port
for
such
service
as
might
be
found
necessary
on
arrival
although
the
attempt
on
the
life
of
our
viceconsul
had
not
been
successful
yet
the
outrage
was
symptomatic
of
a
state
of
excitement
and
disorder
which
demanded
immediate
attention
the
arrival
of
the
vessels
had
the
happiest
result
a
feeling
of
security
at
once
took
the
place
of
the
former
alarm
and
disquiet
our
officers
were
cordially
welcomed
by
the
consular
body
and
the
leading
merchants
and
ordinary
business
resumed
its
activity
the
government
of
the
sultan
gave
a
considerate
hearing
to
the
representations
of
our
minister
the
official
who
was
regarded
as
responsible
for
the
disturbed
condition
of
affairs
was
removed
our
relations
with
the
turkish
government
remain
friendly
our
claims
rounded
on
inequitable
treatment
of
some
of
our
schools
and
missions
appear
to
be
in
process
of
amicable
adjustment
the
signing
of
a
new
commercial
treaty
with
china
which
took
place
at
shanghai
on
the
th
of
october
is
a
cause
for
satisfaction
this
act
the
result
of
long
discussion
and
negotiation
places
our
commercial
relations
with
the
great
oriental
empire
on
a
more
satisfactory
footing
than
they
have
ever
heretofore
enjoyed
it
provides
not
only
for
the
ordinary
rights
and
privileges
of
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
but
also
for
an
important
extension
of
our
commerce
by
increased
facility
of
access
to
chinese
ports
and
for
the
relief
of
trade
by
the
removal
of
some
of
the
obstacles
which
have
embarrassed
it
in
the
past
the
chinese
government
engages
on
fair
and
equitable
conditions
which
will
probably
be
accepted
by
the
principal
commercial
nations
to
abandon
the
levy
of
liken
and
other
transit
dues
throughout
the
empire
and
to
introduce
other
desirable
administrative
reforms
larger
facilities
are
to
be
given
to
our
citizens
who
desire
to
carry
on
mining
enterprises
in
china
we
have
secured
for
our
missionaries
a
valuable
privilege
the
recognition
of
their
right
to
rent
and
lease
in
perpetuity
such
property
as
their
religious
societies
may
need
in
all
parts
of
the
empire
and
what
was
an
indispensable
condition
for
the
advance
and
development
of
our
commerce
in
manchuria
china
by
treaty
with
us
has
opened
to
foreign
commerce
the
cities
of
mukden
the
capital
of
the
province
of
manchuria
and
antung
an
important
port
on
the
yalu
river
on
the
road
to
korea
the
full
measure
of
development
which
our
commerce
may
rightfully
expect
can
hardly
be
looked
for
until
the
settlement
of
the
present
abnormal
state
of
things
in
the
empire
but
the
foundation
for
such
development
has
at
last
been
laid
i
call
your
attention
to
the
reduced
cost
in
maintaining
the
consular
service
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
as
shown
in
the
annual
report
of
the
auditor
for
the
state
and
other
departments
as
compared
with
the
year
previous
for
the
year
under
consideration
the
excess
of
expenditures
over
receipts
on
account
of
the
consular
service
amounted
to
as
against
for
the
year
ending
june
and
for
the
year
ending
june
this
is
the
best
showing
in
this
respect
for
the
consular
service
for
the
past
fourteen
years
and
the
reduction
in
the
cost
of
the
service
to
the
government
has
been
made
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
expenditures
for
the
year
in
question
were
more
than
greater
than
for
the
previous
year
the
rural
freedelivery
service
has
been
steadily
extended
the
attention
of
the
congress
is
asked
to
the
question
of
the
compensation
of
the
letter
carriers
and
clerks
engaged
in
the
postal
service
especially
on
the
new
rural
freedelivery
routes
more
routes
have
been
installed
since
the
first
of
july
last
than
in
any
like
period
in
th
e
departments
history
while
a
due
regard
to
economy
must
be
kept
in
mind
in
the
establishment
of
new
routes
yet
the
extension
of
the
rural
freedelivery
system
must
be
continued
for
reasons
of
sound
public
policy
no
governmental
movement
of
recent
years
has
resulted
in
greater
immediate
benefit
to
the
people
of
the
country
districts
rural
free
delivery
taken
in
connection
with
the
telephone
the
bicycle
and
the
trolley
accomplishes
much
toward
lessening
the
isolation
of
farm
life
and
making
it
brighter
and
more
attractive
in
the
immediate
past
the
lack
of
just
such
facilities
as
these
has
driven
many
of
the
more
active
and
restless
young
men
and
women
from
the
farms
to
the
cities
for
they
rebelled
at
loneliness
and
lack
of
mental
companionship
it
is
unhealthy
and
undesirable
for
the
cities
to
grow
at
the
expense
of
the
country
and
rural
free
delivery
is
not
only
a
good
thing
in
itself
but
is
good
because
it
is
one
of
the
causes
which
check
this
unwholesome
tendency
towards
the
urban
concentration
of
our
population
at
the
expense
of
the
country
districts
it
is
for
the
same
reason
that
we
sympathize
with
and
approve
of
the
policy
of
building
good
roads
the
movement
for
good
roads
is
one
fraught
with
the
greatest
benefit
to
the
country
districts
i
trust
that
the
congress
will
continue
to
favor
in
all
proper
ways
the
louisiana
purchase
exposition
this
exposition
commemorates
the
louisiana
purchase
which
was
the
first
great
step
in
the
expansion
which
made
us
a
continental
nation
the
expedition
of
lewis
and
clark
across
the
continent
followed
thereon
and
marked
the
beginning
of
the
process
of
exploration
and
colonization
which
thrust
our
national
boundaries
to
the
pacific
the
acquisition
of
the
oregon
country
including
the
present
states
of
oregon
and
washington
was
a
fact
of
immense
importance
in
our
history
first
giving
us
our
place
on
the
pacific
seaboard
and
making
ready
the
way
for
our
ascendency
in
the
commerce
of
the
greatest
of
the
oceans
the
centennial
of
our
establishment
upon
the
western
coast
by
the
expedition
of
lewis
and
clark
is
to
be
celebrated
at
portland
oregon
by
an
exposition
in
the
summer
of
and
this
event
should
receive
recognition
and
support
from
the
national
government
i
call
your
special
attention
to
the
territory
of
alaska
the
country
is
developing
rapidly
and
it
has
an
assured
future
the
mineral
wealth
is
great
and
has
as
yet
hardly
been
tapped
the
fisheries
if
wisely
handled
and
kept
under
national
control
will
be
a
business
as
permanent
as
any
other
and
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
people
the
forests
if
properly
guarded
will
form
another
great
source
of
wealth
portions
of
alaska
are
fitted
for
farming
and
stock
raising
although
the
methods
must
be
adapted
to
the
peculiar
conditions
of
the
country
alaska
is
situated
in
the
far
north
but
so
are
norway
and
sweden
and
finland
and
alaska
can
prosper
and
play
its
part
in
the
new
world
just
as
those
nations
have
prospered
and
played
their
parts
in
the
old
world
proper
land
laws
should
be
enacted
and
the
survey
of
the
public
lands
immediately
begun
coalland
laws
should
be
provided
whereby
the
coalland
entryman
may
make
his
location
and
secure
patent
under
methods
kindred
to
those
now
prescribed
for
homestead
and
mineral
entrymen
salmon
hatcheries
exclusively
under
government
control
should
be
established
the
cable
should
be
extended
from
sitka
westward
wagon
roads
and
trails
should
be
built
and
the
building
of
railroads
promoted
in
all
legitimate
ways
lighthouses
should
be
built
along
the
coast
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
needs
of
the
alaska
indians
provision
should
be
made
for
an
officer
with
deputies
to
study
their
needs
relieve
their
immediate
wants
and
help
them
adapt
themselves
to
the
new
conditions
the
commission
appointed
to
investigate
during
the
season
of
the
condition
and
needs
of
the
alaskan
salmon
fisheries
has
finished
its
work
in
the
field
and
is
preparing
a
detailed
report
thereon
a
preliminary
report
reciting
the
measures
immediately
required
for
the
protection
and
preservation
of
the
salmon
industry
has
already
been
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
for
his
attention
and
for
the
needed
action
i
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
for
building
lighthouses
in
hawaii
and
taking
possession
of
those
already
built
the
territory
should
be
reimbursed
for
whatever
amounts
it
has
already
expended
for
lighthouses
the
governor
should
be
empowered
to
suspend
or
remove
any
official
appointed
by
him
without
submitting
the
matter
to
the
legislature
of
our
insular
possessions
the
philippines
and
porto
rico
it
is
gratifying
to
say
that
their
steady
progress
has
been
such
as
to
make
it
unnecessary
to
spend
much
time
in
discussing
them
yet
the
congress
should
ever
keep
in
mind
that
a
peculiar
obligation
rests
upon
us
to
further
in
every
way
the
welfare
of
these
communities
the
philippines
should
be
knit
closer
to
us
by
tariff
arrangements
it
would
of
course
be
impossible
suddenly
to
raise
the
people
of
the
islands
to
the
high
pitch
of
industrial
prosperity
and
of
governmental
efficiency
to
which
they
will
in
the
end
by
degrees
attain
and
the
caution
and
moderation
shown
in
developing
them
have
been
among
the
main
reasons
why
this
development
has
hitherto
gone
on
so
smoothly
scrupulous
care
has
been
taken
in
the
choice
of
governmental
agents
and
the
entire
elimination
of
partisan
politics
from
the
public
service
the
condition
of
the
islanders
is
in
material
things
far
better
than
ever
before
while
their
governmental
intellectual
and
moral
advance
has
kept
pace
with
their
material
advance
no
one
people
ever
benefited
another
people
more
than
we
have
benefited
the
filipinos
by
taking
possession
of
the
islands
the
cash
receipts
of
the
general
land
office
for
the
last
fiscal
year
were
an
increase
of
over
the
preceding
year
of
this
sum
approximately
will
go
to
the
credit
of
the
fund
for
the
reclamation
of
arid
land
making
the
total
of
this
fund
up
to
the
th
of
june
approximately
a
gratifying
disposition
has
been
evinced
by
those
having
unlawful
inclosures
of
public
land
to
remove
their
fences
nearly
two
million
acres
so
inclosed
have
been
thrown
open
on
demand
in
but
comparatively
few
cases
has
it
been
necessary
to
go
into
court
to
accomplish
this
purpose
this
work
will
be
vigorously
prosecuted
until
all
unlawful
inclosures
have
been
removed
experience
has
shown
that
in
the
western
states
themselves
as
well
as
in
the
rest
of
the
country
there
is
widespread
conviction
that
certain
of
the
publicland
laws
and
the
resulting
administrative
practice
no
longer
meet
the
present
needs
the
character
and
uses
of
the
remaining
public
lands
differ
widely
from
those
of
the
public
lands
which
congress
had
especially
in
view
when
these
laws
were
passed
the
rapidly
increasing
rate
of
disposal
of
the
public
lands
is
not
followed
by
a
corresponding
increase
in
home
building
there
is
a
tendency
to
mass
in
large
holdings
public
lands
especially
timber
and
grazing
lands
and
thereby
to
retard
settlement
i
renew
and
emphasize
my
recommendation
of
last
year
that
so
far
as
they
are
available
for
agriculture
in
its
broadest
sense
and
to
whatever
extent
they
may
be
reclaimed
under
the
national
irrigation
law
the
remaining
public
lands
should
be
held
rigidly
for
the
home
builder
the
attention
of
the
congress
is
especially
directed
to
the
timber
and
stone
law
the
desertland
law
and
the
commutation
clause
of
the
homestead
law
which
in
their
operation
have
in
many
respects
conflicted
with
wise
publicland
policy
the
discussions
in
the
congress
and
elsewhere
have
made
it
evident
that
there
is
a
wide
divergence
of
opinions
between
those
holding
opposite
views
on
these
subjects
and
that
the
opposing
sides
have
strong
and
convinced
representatives
of
weight
both
within
and
without
the
congress
the
differences
being
not
only
as
to
matters
of
opinion
but
as
to
matters
of
fact
in
order
that
definite
information
may
be
available
for
the
use
of
the
congress
i
have
appointed
a
commission
composed
of
w
a
richards
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
gifford
pinchot
chief
of
the
bureau
of
forestry
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
f
h
newell
chief
hydrographer
of
the
geological
survey
to
report
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
upon
the
condition
operation
and
effect
of
the
present
land
laws
and
on
the
use
condition
disposal
and
settlement
of
the
public
lands
the
commission
will
report
especially
what
changes
in
organization
laws
regulations
and
practice
affecting
the
public
lands
are
needed
to
effect
the
largest
practicable
disposition
of
the
public
lands
to
actual
settlers
who
will
build
permanent
homes
upon
them
and
to
secure
in
permanence
the
fullest
and
most
effective
use
of
the
resources
of
the
public
lands
and
it
will
make
such
other
reports
and
recommendations
as
its
study
of
these
questions
may
suggest
the
commission
is
to
report
immediately
upon
those
points
concerning
which
its
judgment
is
clear
on
any
point
upon
which
it
has
doubt
it
will
take
the
time
necessary
to
make
investigation
and
reach
a
final
judgment
the
work
of
reclamation
of
the
arid
lands
of
the
west
is
progressing
steadily
and
satisfactorily
under
the
terms
of
the
law
setting
aside
the
proceeds
from
the
disposal
of
public
lands
the
corps
of
engineers
known
as
the
reclamation
service
which
is
conducting
the
surveys
and
examinations
has
been
thoroughly
organized
especial
pains
being
taken
to
secure
under
the
civilservice
rules
a
body
of
skilled
experienced
and
efficient
men
surveys
and
examinations
are
progressing
throughout
the
arid
states
and
territories
plans
for
reclaiming
works
being
prepared
and
passed
upon
by
boards
of
engineers
before
approval
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
arizona
and
nevada
in
localities
where
such
work
is
preeminently
needed
construction
has
already
been
begun
in
other
parts
of
the
arid
west
various
projects
are
well
advanced
towards
the
drawing
up
of
contracts
these
being
delayed
in
part
by
necessities
of
reaching
agreements
or
understanding
as
regards
righ
ts
of
way
or
acquisition
of
real
estate
most
of
the
works
contemplated
for
construction
are
of
national
importance
involving
interstate
questions
or
the
securing
of
stable
selfsupporting
communities
in
the
midst
of
vast
tracts
of
vacant
land
the
nation
as
a
whole
is
of
course
the
gainer
by
the
creation
of
these

and
stability
of
the

furnishing

market
for
the
products

the
east
and
south
the
reclamation
law
while
perhaps
not
ideal
appears
at
present
to
answer
the
larger
needs
for
which
it
is
designed
further
legislation
is
not
recommended
until
the
necessities
of
change
are
more
apparent
the
study
of
the
opportunities
of
reclamation
of
the
vast
extent
of
arid
land
shows
that
whether
this
reclamation
is
done
by
individuals
corporations
or
the
state
the
sources
of
water
supply
must
be
effectively
protected
and
the
reservoirs
guarded
by
the
preservation
of
the
forests
at
the
headwaters
of
the
streams
the
engineers
making
the
preliminary
examinations
continually
emphasize
this
need
and
urge
that
the
remaining
public
lands
at
the
headwaters
of
the
important
streams
of
the
west
be
reserved
to
insure
permanency
of
water
supply
for
irrigation
much
progress
in
forestry
has
been
made
during
the
past
year
the
necessity
for
perpetuating
our
forest
resources
whether
in
public
or
private
hands
is
recognized
now
as
never
before
the
demand
for
forest
reserves
has
become
insistent
in
the
west
because
the
west
must
use
the
water
wood
and
summer
range
which
only
such
reserves
can
supply
progressive
lumbermen
are
striving
through
forestry
to
give
their
business
permanence
other
great
business
interests
are
awakening
to
the
need
of
forest
preservation
as
a
business
matter
the
governments
forest
work
should
receive
from
the
congress
hearty
support
and
especially
support
adequate
for
the
protection
of
the
forest
reserves
against
fire
the
forestreserve
policy
of
the
government
has
passed
beyond
the
experimental
stage
and
has
reached
a
condition
where
scientific
methods
are
essential
to
its
successful
prosecution
the
administrative
features
of
forest
reserves
are
at
present
unsatisfactory
being
divided
between
three
bureaus
of
two
departments
it
is
therefore
recommended
that
all
matters
pertaining
to
forest
reserves
except
those
involving
or
pertaining
to
land
titles
be
consolidated
in
the
bureau
of
forestry
of
the
department
of
agriculture
the
cottongrowing
states
have
recently
been
invaded
by
a
weevil
that
has
done
much
damage
and
threatens
the
entire
cotton
industry
i
suggest
to
the
congress
the
prompt
enactment
of
such
remedial
legislation
as
its
judgment
may
approve
in
granting
patents
to
foreigners
the
proper
course
for
this
country
to
follow
is
to
give
the
same
advantages
to
foreigners
here
that
the
countries
in
which
these
foreigners
dwell
extend
in
return
to
our
citizens
that
is
to
extend
the
benefits
of
our
patent
laws
on
inventions
and
the
like
where
in
return
the
articles
would
be
patentable
in
the
foreign
countries
concernedwhere
an
american
could
get
a
corresponding
patent
in
such
countries
the
indian
agents
should
not
be
dependent
for
their
appointment
or
tenure
of
office
upon
considerations
of
partisan
politics
the
practice
of
appointing
when
possible
exarmy
officers
or
bonded
superintendents
to
the
vacancies
that
occur
is
working
well
attention
is
invited
to
the
widespread
illiteracy
due
to
lack
of
public
schools
in
the
indian
territory
prompt
heed
should
be
paid
to
the
need
of
education
for
the
children
in
this
territory
in
my
last
annual
message
the
attention
of
the
congress
was
called
to
the
necessity
of
enlarging
the
safetyappliance
law
and
it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
this
law
was
amended
in
important
respects
with
the
increasing
railway
mileage
of
the
country
the
greater
number
of
men
employed
and
the
use
of
larger
and
heavier
equipment
the
urgency
for
renewed
effort
to
prevent
the
loss
of
life
and
limb
upon
the
railroads
of
the
country
particularly
to
employees
is
apparent
for
the
inspection
of
water
craft
and
the
lifesaving
service
upon
the
water
the
congress
has
built
up
an
elaborate
body
of
protective
legislation
and
a
thorough
method
of
inspection
and
is
annually
spending
large
sums
of
money
it
is
encouraging
to
observe
that
the
congress
is
alive
to
the
interests
of
those
who
are
employed
upon
our
wonderful
arteries
of
commercethe
railroadswho
so
safely
transport
millions
of
passengers
and
billions
of
tons
of
freight
the
federal
inspection
of
safety
appliances
for
which
the
congress
is
now
making
appropriations
is
a
service
analogous
to
that
which
the
government
has
upheld
for
generations
in
regard
to
vessels
and
it
is
believed
will
prove
of
great
practical
benefit
both
to
railroad
employees
and
the
traveling
public
as
the
greater
part
of
commerce
is
interstate
and
exclusively
under
the
control
of
the
congress
the
needed
safety
and
uniformity
must
be
secured
by
national
legislation
no
other
class
of
our
citizens
deserves
so
well
of
the
nation
as
those
to
whom
the
nation
owes
its
very
being
the
veterans
of
the
civil
war
special
attention
is
asked
to
the
excellent
work
of
the
pension
bureau
in
expediting
and
disposing
of
pension
claims
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
july
the
bureau
settled
claims
an
average
of
claims
for
each
working
day
of
the
year
the
number
of
settlements
since
july
has
been
in
excess
of
last
years
average
approaching
claims
for
each
working
day
and
it
is
believed
that
the
work
of
the
bureau
will
be
current
at
the
close
of
the
present
fiscal
year
during
the
year
ended
june
last
persons
were
appointed
through
competitive
examinations
under
the
civilservice
rules
this
was
more
than
during
the
preceding
year
and
per
cent
of
those
who
passed
the
examinations
this
abnormal
growth
was
largely
occasioned
by
the
extension
of
classification
to
the
rural
freedelivery
service
and
the
appointment
last
year
of
over
rural
carriers
a
revision
of
the
civilservice
rules
took
effect
on
april
last
which
has
greatly
improved
their
operation
the
completion
of
the
reform
of
the
civil
service
is
recognized
by
good
citizens
everywhere
as
a
matter
of
the
highest
public
importance
and
the
success
of
the
merit
system
largely
depends
upon
the
effectiveness
of
the
rules
and
the
machinery
provided
for
their
enforcement
a
very
gratifying
spirit
of
friendly
cooperation
exists
in
all
the
departments
of
the
government
in
the
enforcement
and
uniform
observance
of
both
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
civilservice
act
executive
orders
of
july
march
and
july
require
that
appointments
of
all
unclassified
laborers
both
in
the
departments
at
washington
and
in
the
field
service
shall
be
made
with
the
assistance
of
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
under
a
system
of
registration
to
test
the
relative
fitness
of
applicants
for
appointment
or
employment
this
system
is
competitive
and
is
open
to
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
qualified
in
respect
to
age
physical
ability
moral
character
industry
and
adaptability
for
manual
labor
except
that
in
case
of
veterans
of
the
civil
war
the
element
of
age
is
omitted
this
system
of
appointment
is
distinct
from
the
classified
service
and
does
not
classify
positions
of
mere
laborer
under
the
civilservice
act
and
rules
regulations
in
aid
thereof
have
been
put
in
operation
in
several
of
the
departments
and
are
being
gradually
extended
in
other
parts
of
the
service
the
results
have
been
very
satisfactory
as
extravagance
has
been
checked
by
decreasing
the
number
of
unnecessary
positions
and
by
increasing
the
efficiency
of
the
employees
remaining
the
congress
as
the
result
of
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
charities
and
reformatory
institutions
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
a
joint
select
committee
of
the
two
houses
which
made
its
report
in
march
created
in
the
act
approved
june
a
board
of
charities
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
consist
of
five
residents
of
the
district
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
each
for
a
term
of
three
years
to
serve
without
compensation
president
mckinley
appointed
five
men
who
had
been
active
and
prominent
in
the
public
charities
in
washington
all
of
whom
upon
taking
office
july
resigned
from
the
different
charities
with
which
they
had
been
connected
the
members
of
the
board
have
been
reappointed
in
successive
years
the
board
serves
under
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia
the
board
gave
its
first
year
to
a
careful
and
impartial
study
of
the
special
problems
before
it
and
has
continued
that
study
every
year
in
the
light
of
the
best
practice
in
public
charities
elsewhere
its
recommendations
in
its
annual
reports
to
the
congress
through
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
economical
and
efficient
administration
of
the
charities
and
reformatories
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
required
by
the
act
creating
it
have
been
based
upon
the
principles
commended
by
the
joint
select
committee
of
the
congress
in
its
report
of
march
and
approved
by
the
best
administrators
of
public
charities
and
make
for
the
desired
systematization
and
improvement
of
the
affairs
under
its
supervision
they
are
worthy
of
favorable
consideration
by
the
congress
the
effect
of
the
laws
providing
a
general
staff
for
the
army
and
for
the
more
effective
use
of
the
national
guard
has
been
excellent
great
improvement
has
been
made
in
the
efficiency
of
our
army
in
recent
years
such
schools
as
those
erected
at
fort
leavenworth
and
fort
riley
and
the
institution
of
fall
maneuver
work
accomplish
satisfactory
results
the
good
effect
of
these
maneuvers
upon
the
national
guard
is
marked
and
ample
appropriation
should
be
made
to
enable
the
guardsmen
of
the
several
states
to
share
in
the
benefit
the
government
should
as
soon
as
possible
secure
suitable
permanent
camp
sites
for
military
maneuvers
in
the
various
sections
of
the
country
the
service
thereby
rendered
not
only
to
the
regular
army
but
to
the
national
guard
of
the
several
states
will
be
so
great
as
to
repay

many
times
over
the
relatively
small
expense
we
should
not
rest
satisfied
with
what
has
been
done
however
the
only
people
who
are
contented
with
a
system
of
promotion
by
mere
seniority
are
those
who
are
contented
with
the
triumph
of
mediocrity
over
excellence
on
the
other
hand
a
system
which
encouraged
the
exercise
of
social
or
political
favoritism
in
promotions
would
be
even
worse
but
it
would
surely
be
easy
to
devise
a
method
of
promotion
from
grade
to
grade
in
which
the
opinion
of
the
higher
officers
of
the
service
upon
the
candidates
should
be
decisive
upon
the
standing
and
promotion
of
the
latter
just
such
a
system
now
obtains
at
west
point
the
quality
of
each
years
work
determines
the
standing
of
that
years
class
the
man
being
dropped
or
graduated
into
the
next
class
in
the
relative
position
which
his
military
superiors
decide
to
be
warranted
by
his
merit
in
other
words
ability
energy
fidelity
and
all
other
similar
qualities
determine
the
rank
of
a
man
year
after
year
in
west
point
and
his
standing
in
the
army
when
he
graduates
from
west
point
but
from
that
time
on
all
effort
to
find
which
man
is
best
or
worst
and
reward
or
punish
him
accordingly
is
abandoned
no
brilliancy
no
amount
of
hard
work
no
eagerness
in
the
performance
of
duty
can
advance
him
and
no
slackness
or
indifference
that
falls
short
of
a
courtmartial
offense
can
retard
him
until
this
system
is
changed
we
can
not
hope
that
our
officers
will
be
of
as
high
grade
as
we
have
a
right
to
expect
considering
the
material
upon
which
we
draw
moreover
when
a
man
renders
such
service
as
captain
pershing
rendered
last
spring
in
the
moro
campaign
it
ought
to
be
possible
to
reward
him
without
at
once
jumping
him
to
the
grade
of
brigadiergeneral
shortly
after
the
enunciation
of
that
famous
principle
of
american
foreign
policy
now
known
as
the
monroe
doctrine
president
monroe
in
a
special
message
to
congress
on
january
spoke
as
follows
the
navy
is
the
arm
from
which
our
government
will
always
derive
most
aid
in
support
of
our
rights
every
power
engaged
in
war
will
know
the
strength
of
our
naval
power
the
number
of
our
ships
of
each
class
their
condition
and
the
promptitude
with
which
we
may
bring
them
into
service
and
will
pay
due
consideration
to
that
argument
i
heartily
congratulate
the
congress
upon
the
steady
progress
in
building
up
the
american
navy
we
can
not
afford
a
letup
in
this
great
work
to
stand
still
means
to
go
back
there
should
be
no
cessation
in
adding
to
the
effective
units
of
the
fighting
strength
of
the
fleet
meanwhile
the
navy
department
and
the
officers
of
the
navy
are
doing
well
their
part
by
providing
constant
service
at
sea
under
conditions
akin
to
those
of
actual
warfare
our
officers
and
enlisted
men
are
learning
to
handle
the
battleships
cruisers
and
torpedo
boats
with
high
efficiency
in
fleet
and
squadron
formations
and
the
standard
of
marksmanship
is
being
steadily
raised
the
best
work
ashore
is
indispensable
but
the
highest
duty
of
a
naval
officer
is
to
exercise
command
at
sea
the
establishment
of
a
naval
base
in
the
philippines
ought
not
to
be
longer
postponed
such
a
base
is
desirable
in
time
of
peace
in
time
of
war
it
would
be
indispensable
and
its
lack
would
be
ruinous
without
it
our
fleet
would
be
helpless
our
naval
experts
are
agreed
that
subig
bay
is
the
proper
place
for
the
purpose
the
national
interests
require
that
the
work
of
fortification
and
development
of
a
naval
station
at
subig
bay
be
begun
at
an
early
date
for
under
the
best
conditions
it
is
a
work
which
will
consume
much
time
it
is
eminently
desirable
however
that
there
should
be
provided
a
naval
general
staff
on
lines
similar
to
those
of
the
general
staff
lately
created
for
the
army
within
the
navy
department
itself
the
needs
of
the
service
have
brought
about
a
system
under
which
the
duties
of
a
general
staff
are
partially
performed
for
the
bureau
of
navigation
has
under
its
direction
the
war
college
the
office
of
naval
intelligence
and
the
board
of
inspection
and
has
been
in
close
touch
with
the
general
board
of
the
navy
but
though
under
the
excellent
officers
at
their
head
these
boards
and
bureaus
do
good
work
they
have
not
the
authority
of
a
general
staff
and
have
not
sufficient
scope
to
insure
a
proper
readiness
for
emergencies
we
need
the
establishment
by
law
of
a
body
of
trained
officers
who
shall
exercise
a
systematic
control
of
the
military
affairs
of
the
navy
and
be
authorized
advisers
of
the
secretary
concerning
it
by
the
act
of
june
the
congress
authorized
the
president
to
enter
into
treaty
with
colombia
for
the
building
of
the
canal
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
it
being
provided
that
in
the
event
of
failure
to
secure
such
treaty
after
the
lapse
of
a
reasonable
time
recourse
should
be
had
to
building
a
canal
through
nicaragua
it
has
not
been
necessary
to
consider
this
alternative
as
i
am
enabled
to
lay
before
the
senate
a
treaty
providing
for
the
building
of
the
canal
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
this
was
the
route
which
commended
itself
to
the
deliberate
judgment
of
the
congress
and
we
can
now
acquire
by
treaty
the
right
to
construct
the
canal
over
this
route
the
question
now
therefore
is
not
by
which
route
the
isthmian
canal
shall
be
built
for
that
question
has
been
definitely
and
irrevocably
decided
the
question
is
simply
whether
or
not
we
shall
have
an
isthmian
canal
when
the
congress
directed
that
we
should
take
the
panama
route
under
treaty
with
colombia
the
essence
of
the
condition
of
course
referred
not
to
the
government
which
controlled
that
route
but
to
the
route
itself
to
the
territory
across
which
the
route
lay
not
to
the
name
which
for
the
moment
the
territory
bore
on
the
map
the
purpose
of
the
law
was
to
authorize
the
president
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
power
in
actual
control
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
this
purpose
has
been
fulfilled
in
the
year
this
government
entered
into
a
treaty
with
new
granada
the
predecessor
upon
the
isthmus
of
the
republic
of
colombia
and
of
the
present
republic
of
panama
by
which
treaty
it
was
provided
that
the
government
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
should
always
have
free
and
open
right
of
way
or
transit
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
by
any
modes
of
communication
that
might
be
constructed
while
in
turn
our
government
guaranteed
the
perfect
neutrality
of
the
abovementioned
isthmus
with
the
view
that
the
free
transit
from
the
one
to
the
other
sea
might
not
be
interrupted
or
embarrassed
the
treaty
vested
in
the
united
states
a
substantial
property
right
carved
out
of
the
rights
of
sovereignty
and
property
which
new
granada
then
had
and
possessed
over
the
said
territory
the
name
of
new
granada
has
passed
away
and
its
territory
has
been
divided
its
successor
the
government
of
colombia
has
ceased
to
own
any
property
in
the
isthmus
a
new
republic
that
of
panama
which
was
at
one
time
a
sovereign
state
and
at
another
time
a
mere
department
of
the
successive
confederations
known
as
new
granada
and
columbia
has
now
succeeded
to
the
rights
which
first
one
and
then
the
other
formerly
exercised
over
the
isthmus
but
as
long
as
the
isthmus
endures
the
mere
geographical
fact
of
its
existence
and
the
peculiar
interest
therein
which
is
required
by
our
position
perpetuate
the
solemn
contract
which
binds
the
holders
of
the
territory
to
respect
our
right
to
freedom
of
transit
across
it
and
binds
us
in
return
to
safeguard
for
the
isthmus
and
the
world
the
exercise
of
that
inestimable
privilege
the
true
interpretation
of
the
obligations
upon
which
the
united
states
entered
in
this
treaty
of
has
been
given
repeatedly
in
the
utterances
of
presidents
and
secretaries
of
state
secretary
cuss
in
officially
stated
the
position
of
this
government
as
follows
the
progress
of
events
has
rendered
the
interoceanic
route
across
the
narrow
portion
of
central
america
vastly
important
to
the
commercial
world
and
especially
to
the
united
states
whose
possessions
extend
along
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
and
demand
the
speediest
and
easiest
modes
of
communication
while
the
rights
of
sovereignty
of
the
states
occupying
this
region
should
always
be
respected
we
shall
expect
that
these
rights
be
exercised
in
a
spirit
befitting
the
occasion
and
the
wants
and
circumstances
that
have
arisen
sovereignty
has
its
duties
as
well
as
its
rights
and
none
of
these
local
governments
even
if
administered
with
more
regard
to
the
just
demands
of
other
nations
than
they
have
been
would
be
permitted
in
a
spirit
of
eastern
isolation
to
close
the
gates
of
intercourse
on
the
great
highways
of
the
world
and
justify
the
act
by
the
pretension
that
these
avenues
of
trade
and
travel
belong
to
them
and
that
they
choose
to
shut
them
or
what
is
almost
equivalent
to
encumber
them
with
such
unjust
relations
as
would
prevent
their
general
use
seven
years
later
in
mr
seward
in
different
communications
took
the
following
position
the
united
states
have
taken
and
will
take
no
interest
in
any
question
of
internal
revolution
in
the
state
of
panama
or
any
state
of
the
united
states
of
colombia
but
will
maintain
a
perfect
neutrality
in
connection
with
such
domestic
altercations
the
united
states
will
nevertheless
hold
themselves
ready
to
protect
the
transit
trade
across
the
isthmus
against
invasion
of
either
domestic
or
foreign
disturbers
of
the
peace
of
the
state
of
panama
neither
the
text
nor
the
spirit
of
the
stipulation
in
that
article
by
which
the
united
states
engages
to
preserve
the
neutrality
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
imposes
an
obligation
on
this
government
to
comply
with
the
requisition
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
colombia
for
a
force
to
protect
the
isthmus
of
panama
from
a
body
of
insurgents
of
that
country
the
purpose
of
the
stipulation
was
to
guarantee
the
isthmus
against
seizure
or
invasion
by
a
foreign
power
only
attorneygeneral
speed
under
date
of
november
advised
secretary
seward
as
follows
from
this
treaty
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
new
granada
invited
the
united
states
to
become
a
party
to
the
intestine
troubles
of
that
government
nor
did
the
united

states
become
bound
to
take
sides
in
the
domestic
broils
of
new
granada
the
united
states
did
guarantee
new
granada
in
the
sovereignty
and
property
over
the
territory
this
was
as
against
other
and
foreign
governments
for
four
hundred
years
ever
since
shortly
after
the
discovery
of
this
hemisphere
the
canal
across
the
isthmus
has
been
planned
for
two
score
years
it
has
been
worked
at
when
made
it
is
to
last
for
the
ages
it
is
to
alter
the
geography
of
a
continent
and
the
trade
routes
of
the
world
we
have
shown
by
every
treaty
we
have
negotiated
or
attempted
to
negotiate
with
the
peoples
in
control
of
the
isthmus
and
with
foreign
nations
in
reference
thereto
our
consistent
good
faith
in
observing
our
obligations
on
the
one
hand
to
the
peoples
of
the
isthmus
and
on
the
other
hand
to
the
civilized
world
whose
commercial
rights
we
are
safeguarding
and
guaranteeing
by
our
action
we
have
done
our
duty
to
others
in
letter
and
in
spirit
and
we
have
shown
the
utmost
forbearance
in
exacting
our
own
rights
last
spring
under
the
act
above
referred
to
a
treaty
concluded
between
the
representatives
of
the
republic
of
colombia
and
of
our
government
was
ratified
by
the
senate
this
treaty
was
entered
into
at
the
urgent
solicitation
of
the
people
of
colombia
and
after
a
body
of
experts
appointed
by
our
government
especially
to
go
into
the
matter
of
the
routes
across
the
isthmus
had
pronounced
unanimously
in
favor
of
the
panama
route
in
drawing
up
this
treaty
every
concession
was
made
to
the
people
and
to
the
government
of
colombia
we
were
more
than
just
in
dealing
with
them
our
generosity
was
such
as
to
make
it
a
serious
question
whether
we
had
not
gone
too
far
in
their
interest
at
the
expense
of
our
own
for
in
our
scrupulous
desire
to
pay
all
possible
heed
not
merely
to
the
real
but
even
to
the
fancied
rights
of
our
weaker
neighbor
who
already
owed
so
much
to
our
protection
and
forbearance
we
yielded
in
all
possible
ways
to
her
desires
in
drawing
up
the
treaty
nevertheless
the
government
of
colombia
not
merely
repudiated
the
treaty
but
repudiated
it
in
such
manner
as
to
make
it
evident
by
the
time
the
colombian
congress
adjourned
that
not
the
scantiest
hope
remained
of
ever
getting
a
satisfactory
treaty
from
them
the
government
of
colombia
made
the
treaty
and
yet
when
the
colombian
congress
was
called
to
ratify
it
the
vote
against
ratification
was
unanimous
it
does
not
appear
that
the
government
made
any
real
effort
to
secure
ratification
immediately
after
the
adjournment
of
the
congress
a
revolution
broke
out
in
panama
the
people
of
panama
had
long
been
discontented
with
the
republic
of
colombia
and
they
had
been
kept
quiet
only
by
the
prospect
of
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
which
was
to
them
a
matter
of
vital
concern
when
it
became
evident
that
the
treaty
was
hopelessly
lost
the
people
of
panama
rose
literally
as
one
man
not
a
shot
was
fired
by
a
single
man
on
the
isthmus
in
the
interest
of
the
colombian
government
not
a
life
was
lost
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
revolution
the
colombian
troops
stationed
on
the
isthmus
who
had
long
been
unpaid
made
common
cause
with
the
people
of
panama
and
with
astonishing
unanimity
the
new
republic
was
started
the
duty
of
the
united
states
in
the
premises
was
clear
in
strict
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down
by
secretaries
cass
and
seward
in
the
official
documents
above
quoted
the
united
states
gave
notice
that
it
would
permit
the
landing
of
no
expeditionary
force
the
arrival
of
which
would
mean
chaos
and
destruction
along
the
line
of
the
railroad
and
of
the
proposed
canal
and
an
interruption
of
transit
as
an
inevitable
consequence
the
de
facto
government
of
panama
was
recognized
in
the
following
telegram
to
mr
ehrman
the
people
of
panama
have
by
apparently
unanimous
movement
dissolved
their
political
connection
with
the
republic
of
colombia
and
resumed
their
independence
when
you
are
satisfied
that
a
de
facto
government
republican
in
form
and
without
substantial
opposition
from
its
own
people
has
been
established
in
the
state
of
panama
you
will
enter
into
relations
with
it
as
the
responsible
government
of
the
territory
and
look
to
it
for
all
due
action
to
protect
the
persons
and
property
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
to
keep
open
the
isthmian
transit
in
accordance
with
the
obligations
of
existing
treaties
governing
the
relations
of
the
united
states
to
that
territory
the
government
of
colombia
was
notified
of
our
action
by
the
following
telegram
to
mr
beaupre
the
people
of
panama
having
by
an
apparently
unanimous
movement
dissolved
their
political
connection
with
the
republic
of
colombia
and
resumed
their
independence
and
having
adopted
a
government
of
their
own
republican
in
form
with
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
has
entered
into
relations
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
the
ties
of
friendship
which
have
so
long
and
so
happily
existed
between
the
respective
nations
most
earnestly
commends
to
the
governments
of
colombia
and
of
panama
the
peaceful
and
equitable
settlement
of
all
questions
at
issue
between
them
he
holds
that
he
is
bound
not
merely
by
treaty
obligations
but
by
the
interests
of
civilization
to
see
that
the
peaceful
traffic
of
the
world
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
shall
not
longer
be
disturbed
by
a
constant
succession
of
unnecessary
and
wasteful
civil
wars

these
events
happened
fiftyseven
years

elapsed

the

its
treaty
with

during
that
time
the
governments
of

been
in

the

a

of
the

rebellions
insurrections

and
other
outbreaks
that
have
occurred
during
the
period
in
question
yet
they
number
for
the
years
it
will
be
noted
that
one
of
them
lasted
for
nearly
three
years
before
it
was
quelled
another
for
nearly
a
year
in
short
the
experience
of
over
half
a
century
has
shown
colombia
to
be
utterly
incapable
of
keeping
order
on
the
isthmus
only
the
active
interference
of
the
united
states
has
enabled
her
to
preserve
so
much
as
a
semblance
of
sovereignty
had
it
not
been
for
the
exercise
by
the
united
states
of
the
police
power
in
her
interest
her
connection
with
the
isthmus
would
have
been
sundered
long
ago
in
in
in
in
in
and
again
in
sailors
and
marines
from
united
states
war
ships
were
forced
to
land
in
order
to
patrol
the
isthmus
to
protect
life
and
property
and
to
see
that
the
transit
across
the
isthmus
was
kept
open
in
in
in
and
in
the
colombian
government
asked
that
the
united
states
government
would
land
troops
to
protect
its
interests
and
maintain
order
on
the
isthmus
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
request
is
that
which
has
just
been
received
and
which
runs
as
follows
knowing
that
revolution
has
already
commenced
in
panama
an
eminent
colombian
says
that
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
will
land
troops
to
preserve
colombian
sovereignty
and
the
transit
if
requested
by
colombian
charge
daffaires
this
government
will
declare
martial
law
and
by
virtue
of
vested
constitutional
authority
when
public
order
is
disturbed
will
approve
by
decree
ratification
of
the
canal
treaty
as
signed
or
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
prefers
will
call
extra
session
of
the
congresswith
new
and
friendly
membersnext
may
to
approve
the
treaty
an
eminent
colombian
has
the
perfect
confidence
of
vicepresident
he
says
and
if
it
became
necessary
will
go
to
the
isthmus
or
send
representatives
there
to
adjust
matters
along
above
lines
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
there
this
dispatch
is
noteworthy
from
two
standpoints
its
offer
of
immediately
guaranteeing
the
treaty
to
us
is
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
positive
and
contemptuous
refusal
of
the
congress
which
has
just
closed
its
sessions
to
consider
favorably

such
a
treaty
it
shows
that
the
government
which
made
the
treaty
really
had
absolute
control
over
the
situation
but
did
not
choose
to
exercise
this
control
the
dispatch
further
calls
on
us
to
restore
order
and
secure
colombian
supremacy
in
the
isthmus
from
which
the
colombian
government
has
just
by
its
action
decided
to
bar
us
by
preventing
the
construction
of
the
canal
the
control
in
the
interest
of
the
commerce
and
traffic
of
the
whole
civilized
world
of
the
means
of
undisturbed
transit
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
has
become
of
transcendent
importance
to
the
united
states
we
have
repeatedly
exercised
this
control
by
intervening
in
the
course
of
domestic
dissension
and
by
protecting
the
territory
from
foreign
invasion
in
mr
everett
assured
the
peruvian
minister
that
we
should
not
hesitate
to
maintain
the
neutrality
of
the
isthmus
in
the
case
of
war
between
peru
and
colombia
in
colombia
which
has
always
been
vigilant
to
avail
itself
of
its
privileges
conferred
by
the
treaty
expressed
its
expectation
that
in
the
event
of
war
between
peru
and
spain
the
united
states
would
carry
into
effect
the
guaranty
of
neutrality
there
have
been
few
administrations
of
the
state
department
in
which
this
treaty
has
not
either
by
the
one
side
or
the
other
been
used
as
a
basis
of
more
or
less
important
demands
it
was
said
by
mr
fish
in
that
the
department
of
state
had
reason
to
believe
that
an
attack
upon
colombian
sovereignty
on
the
isthmus
had
on
several
occasions
been
averted
by
warning
from
this
government
in
when
colombia
was
under
the
menace
of
hostilities
from
italy
in
the
cerruti
case
mr
bayard
expressed
the
serious
concern
that
the
united
states
could
not
but
feel
that
a
european
power
should
resort
to
force
against
a
sister
republic
of
this
hemisphere
as
to
the
sovereign
and
uninterrupted
use
of
a
part
of
whose
territory
we
are
guarantors
under
the
solemn
faith
of
a
treaty
the
above
recital
of
facts
establishes
beyond
question
first
that
the
united
states
has
for
over
half
a
century
patiently
and
in
good
faith
carried
out
its
obligations
under
the
treaty
of
second
that
when
for
the
first
time
it
became
possible
for
colombia
to
do
anything
in
requital
of
the
services
thus
repeatedly
rendered
to
it
for
fiftyseven
years
by
the
united
states
the
colombian
government
peremptorily
and
offensively
refused
thus
to
do
its
part
even
though
to
do
so
would
have
been
to
its
advantage
and
immeasurably
to
the
advantage
of
the
state
of
panama
at
that
time
under
its
jurisdiction
third
that
throughout
this
period
revolutions
riots
and
factional
disturbances
of
every
kind
have
occurred
one
after
the
other
in
almost
uninterrupted
succession
some
of
them
lasting
for
months
and
even
for
years
while
the
central
government
was
unable
to
put
them
down
or
to
make
peace
with
the
rebels
fourth
that
these
disturbances
instead
of
showing
any
sign
of
abating
have
tended
to
grow
more
numerous
and
more
serious
in
the
immediate
past
fifth
that
the
control
of
colombia
over
the
isthmus
of
panama
could
not
be
maintained
without
the
armed
intervention
and
assistance
of
the
united
states
in
other
words
the
government
of
colombia
though
wholly
unable
to
maintain
order
on
the
isthmus
has
nevertheless
declined
to
ratify
a
treaty
the
conclusion
of
which
opened
the
only
chance
to
secure
its
own
stability
and
to
guarantee
permanent
peace
on
and
the
construction
of
a
canal
across
the
isthmus
under
such
circumstances
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
have
been
guilty
of
folly
and
weakness
amounting
in
their
sum
to
a
crime
against
the
nation
had
it
acted
otherwise
than
it
did
when
the
revolution
of
november
last
took
place
in
panama
this
great
enterprise
of
building
the
interoceanic
canal
can
not
be
held
up
to
gratify
the
whims
or
out
of
respect
to
the
governmental
impotence
or
to
the
even
more
sinister
and
evil
political
peculiarities
of
people
who
though
they
dwell
afar
off
yet
against
the
wish
of
the
actual
dwellers
on
the
isthmus
assert
an
unreal
supremacy
over
the
territory
the
possession
of
a
territory
fraught
with
such
peculiar
capacities
as
the
isthmus
in
question
carries
with
it
obligations
to
mankind
the
course
of
events
has
shown
that
this
canal
can
not
be
built
by
private
enterprise
or
by
any
other
nation
than
our
own
therefore
it
must
be
built
by
the
united
states
every
effort
has
been
made
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
persuade
colombia
to
follow
a
course
which
was
essentially
not
only
to
our
interests
and
to
the
interests
of
the
world
but
to
the
interests
of
colombia
itself
these
efforts
have
failed
and
colombia
by
her
persistence
in
repulsing
the
advances
that
have
been
made
has
forced
us
for
the
sake
of
our
own
honor
and
of
the
interest
and
wellbeing
not
merely
of
our
own
people
but
of
the
people
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
and
the
people
of
the
civilized
countries
of
the
world
to
take
decisive
steps
to
bring
to
an
end
a
condition
of
affairs
which
had
become
intolerable
the
new
republic
of
panama
immediately
offered
to
negotiate
a
treaty
with
us
this
treaty
i
herewith
submit
by
it
our
interests
are
better
safeguarded
than
in
the
treaty
with
colombia
which
was
ratified
by
the
senate
at
its
last
session
it
is
better
in
its
terms
than
the
treaties
offered
to
us
by
the
republics
of
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
at
last
the
right
to
begin
this
great
undertaking
is
made
available
panama
has
done
her
part
all
that
remains
is
for
the
american
congress
to
do
its
part
and
forthwith
this
republic
will
enter
upon
the
execution
of
a
project
colossal
in
its
size
and
of
wellnigh
incalculable
possibilities
for
the
good
of
this
country
and
the
nations
of
mankind
by
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
the
united
states
guarantees
and
will
maintain
the
independence
of
the
republic
of
panama
there
is
granted
to
the
united
states
in
perpetuity
the
use
occupation
and
control
of
a
strip
ten
miles
wide
and
extending
three
nautical
miles
into
the
sea
at
either
terminal
with
all
lands
lying
outside
of
the
zone
necessary
for
the
construction
of
the
canal
or
for
its
auxiliary
works
and
with
the
islands
in
the
bay
of
panama
the
cities
of
panama
and
colon
are
not
embraced
in
the
canal
zone
but
the
united
states
assumes
their
sanitation
and
in
case
of
need
the
maintenance
of
order
therein
the
united
states
enjoys
within
the
granted
limits
all
the
rights
power
and
authority
which
it
would
possess
were
it
the
sovereign
of
the
territory
to
the
exclusion
of
the
exercise
of
sovereign
rights
by
the
republic
all
railway
and
canal
property
rights
belonging
to
panama
and
needed
for
the
canal
pass
to
the
united
states
including
any
property
of
the
respective
companies
in
the
cities
of
panama
and
colon
the
works
property
and
personnel
of
the
canal
and
railways
are
exempted
from
taxation
as
well
in
the
cities
of
panama
and
colon
as
in
the
canal
zone
and
its
dependencies
free
immigration
of
the
personnel
and
importation
of
supplies
for
the
construction
and
operation
of
the
canal
are
granted
provision
is
made
for
the
use
of
military
force
and
the
building
of
fortifications
by
the
united
states
for
the
protection
of
the
transit
in
other
details
particularly
as
to
the
acquisition
of
the
interests
of
the
new
panama
canal
company
and
the
panama
railway
by
the
united
states
and
the
condemnation
of
private
property
for
the
uses
of
the
canal
the
stipulations
of
the
hayherran
treaty
are
closely
followed
while
the
compensation
to
be
given
for
these
enlarged
grants
remains
the
same
being
ten
millions
of
dollars
payable
on
exchange
of
ratifications
and
beginning
nine
years
from
that
date
an
annual
payment
of
during
the
life
of
the
convention

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
we
still
continue
in
a
period
of
unbounded
prosperity
this
prosperity
is
not
the
creature
of
law
but
undoubtedly
the
laws
under
which
we
work
have
been
instrumental
in
creating
the
conditions
which
made
it
possible
and
by
unwise
legislation
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
destroy
it
there
will
undoubtedly
be
periods
of
depression
the
wave
will
recede
but
the
tide
will
advance
this
nation
is
seated
on
a
continent
flanked
by
two
great
oceans
it
is
composed
of
men
the
descendants
of
pioneers
or
in
a
sense
pioneers
themselves
of
men
winnowed
out
from
among
the
nations
of
the
old
world
by
the
energy
boldness
and
love
of
adventure
found
in
their
own
eager
hearts
such
a
nation
so
placed
will
surely
wrest
success
from
fortune
as
a
people
we
have
played
a
large
part
in
the
world
and
we
are
bent
upon
making
our
future
even
larger
than
the
past
in
particular
the
events
of
the
last
four
years
have
definitely
decided
that
for
woe
or
for
weal
our
place
must
be
great
among
the
nations
we
may
either
fall
greatly
or
succeed
greatly
but
we
can
not
avoid
the
endeavor
from
which
either
great
failure
or
great
success
must
come
even
if
we
would
we
can
not
play
a
small
part
if
we
should
try
all
that
would
follow
would
be
that
we
should
play
a
large
part
ignobly
and
shamefully
but
our
people
the
sons
of
the
men
of
the
civil
war
the
sons
of
the
men
who
had
iron
in
their
blood
rejoice
in
the
present
and
face
the
future
high
of
heart
and
resolute
of
will
ours
is
not
the
creed
of
the
weakling
and
the
coward
ours
is
the
gospel
of
hope
and
of
triumphant
endeavor
we
do
not
shrink
from
the
struggle
before
us
there
are
many
problems
for
us
to
face
at
the
outset
of
the
twentieth
centurygrave
problems
abroad
and
still
graver
at
home
but
we
know
that
we
can
solve
them
and
solve
them
well
provided
only
that
we
bring
to
the
solution
the
qualities
of
head
and
heart
which
were
shown
by
the
men
who
in
the
days
of
washington
rounded
this
government
and
in
the
days
of
lincoln
preserved
it
no
country
has
ever
occupied
a
higher
plane
of
material
wellbeing
than
ours
at
the
present
moment
this
wellbeing
is
due
to
no
sudden
or
accidental
causes
but
to
the
play
of
the
economic
forces
in
this
country
for
over
a
century
to
our
laws
our
sustained
and
continuous
policies
above
all
to
the
high
individual
average
of
our
citizenship
great
fortunes
have
been
won
by
those
who
have
taken
the
lead
in
this
phenomenal
industrial
development
and
most
of
these
fortunes
have
been
won
not
by
doing
evil
but
as
an
incident
to
action
which
has
benefited
the
community
as
a
whole
never
before
has
material
wellbeing
been
so
widely
diffused
among
our
people
great
fortunes
have
been
accumulated
and
yet
in
the
aggregate
these
fortunes
are
small
indeed
when
compared
to
the
wealth
of
the
people
as
a
whole
the
plain
people
are
better
off
than
they
have
ever
been
before
the
insurance
companies
which
are
practically
mutual
benefit
societiesespecially
helpful
to
men
of
moderate
meansrepresent
accumulations
of
capital
which
are
among
the
largest
in
this
country
there
are
more
deposits
in
the
savings
banks
more
owners
of
farms
more
wellpaid
wageworkers
in
this
country
now
than
ever
before
in
our
history
of
course
when
the
conditions
have
favored
the
growth
of
so
much
that
was
good
they
have
also
favored
somewhat
the
growth
of
what
was
evil
it
is
eminently
necessary
that
we
should
endeavor
to
cut
out
this
evil
but
let
us
keep
a
due
sense
of
proportion
let
us
not
in
fixing
our
gaze
upon
the
lesser
evil
forget
the
greater
good
the
evils
are
real
and
some
of
them
are
menacing
but
they
are
the
outgrowth
not
of
misery
or
decadence
but
of
prosperityof
the
progress
of
our
gigantic
industrial
development
this
industrial
development
must
not
be
checked
but
side
by
side
with
it
should
go
such
progressive
regulation
as
will
diminish
the
evils
we
should
fail
in
our
duty
if
we
did
not
try
to
remedy
the
evils
but
we
shall
succeed
only
if
we
proceed
patiently
with
practical
common
sense
as
well
as
resolution
separating
the
good
from
the
bad
and
holding
on
to
the
former
while
endeavoring
to
get
rid
of
the
latter
in
my
message
to
the
present
congress
at
its
first
session
i
discussed
at
length
the
question
of
the
regulation
of
those
big
corporations
commonly
doing
an
interstate
business
often
with
some
tendency
to
monopoly
which
are
popularly
known
as
trusts
the
experience
of
the
past
year
has
emphasized
in
my
opinion
the
desirability
of
the
steps
i
then
proposed
a
fundamental
requisite
of
social
efficiency
is
a
high
standard
of
individual
energy
and
excellence
but
this
is
in
no
wise
inconsistent
with
power
to
act
in
combination
for
aims
which
can
not
so
well
be
achieved
by
the
individual
acting
alone
a
fundamental
base
of
civilization
is
the
inviolability
of
property
but
this
is
in
no
wise
inconsistent
with
the
right
of
society
to
regulate
the
exercise
of
the
artificial
powers
which
it
confers
upon
the
owners
of
property
under
the
name
of
corporate
franchises
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
the
misuse
of
these
powers
corporations
and
especially
combinations
of
corporations
should
be
managed
under
public
regulation
experience
has
shown
that
under
our
system
of
government
the
necessary
supervision
can
not
be
obtained
by
state
action
it
must
therefore
be
achieved
by
national
action
our
aim
is
not
to
do
away
with
corporations
on
the
contrary
these
big
aggregations
are
an
inevitable
development
of
modern
industrialism
and
the
effort
to
destroy
them
would
be
futile
unless
accomplished
in
ways
that
would
work
the
utmost
mischief
to
the
entire
body
politic
we
can
do
nothing
of
good
in
the
way
of
regulating
and
supervising
these
corporations
until
we
fix
clearly
in
our
minds
that
we
are
not
attacking
the
corporations
but
endeavoring
to
do
away
with
any
evil
in
them
we
are
not
hostile
to
them
we
are
merely
determined
that
they
shall
be
so
handled
as
to
subserve
the
public
good
we
draw
the
line
against
misconduct
not
against
wealth
the
capitalist
who
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
his
fellows
performs
some
great
industrial
feat
by
which
he
wins
money
is
a
welldoer
not
a
wrongdoer
provided
only
he
works
in
proper
and
legitimate
lines
we
wish
to
favor
such
a
man
when
he
does
well
we
wish
to
supervise
and
control
his
actions
only
to
prevent
him
from
doing
ill
publicity
can
do
no
harm
to
the
honest
corporation
and
we
need
not
be
over
tender
about
sparing
the
dishonest
corporation
in
curbing
and
regulating
the
combinations
of
capital
which
are
or
may
become
injurious
to
the
public
we
must
be
careful
not
to
stop
the
great
enterprises
which
have
legitimately
reduced
the
cost
of
production
not
to
abandon
the
place
which
our
country
has
won
in
the
leadership
of
the
international
industrial
world
not
to
strike
down
wealth
with
the
result
of
closing
factories
and
mines
of
turning
the
wageworker
idle
in
the
streets
and
leaving
the
farmer
without
a
market
for
what
he
grows
insistence
upon
the
impossible
means
delay
in
achieving
the
possible
exactly
as
on
the
other
hand
the
stubborn
defense
alike
of
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
in
the
existing
system
the
resolute
effort
to
obstruct
any
attempt
at
betterment
betrays
blindness
to
the
historic
truth
that
wise
evolution
is
the
sure
safeguard
against
revolution
no
more
important
subject
can
come
before
the
congress
than
this
of
the
regulation
of
interstate
business
this
country
can
not
afford
to
sit
supine
on
the
plea
that
under
our
peculiar
system
of
government
we
are
helpless
in
the
presence
of
the
new
conditions
and
unable
to
grapple
with
them
or
to
cut
out
whatever
of
evil
has
arisen
in
connection
with
them
the
power
of
the
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
is
an
absolute
and
unqualified
grant
and
without
limitations
other
than
those
prescribed
by
the
constitution
the
congress
has
constitutional
authority
to
make
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
for
executing
this
power
and
i
am
satisfied
that
this
power
has
not
been
exhausted
by
any
legislation
now
on
the
statute
books
it
is
evident
therefore
that
evils
restrictive
of
commercial
freedom
and
entailing
restraint
upon
national
commerce
fall
within
the
regulative
power
of
the
congress
and
that
a
wise
and
reasonable
law
would
be
a
necessary
and
proper
exercise
of
congressional
authority
to
the
end
that
such
evils
should
be
eradicated
i
believe
that
monopolies
unjust
discriminations
which
prevent
or
cripple
competition
fraudulent
overcapitalization
and
other
evils
in
trust
organizations
and
practices
which
injuriously
affect
interstate
trade
can
be
prevented
under
the
power
of
the
congress
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states
through
regulations
and
requirements
operating
directly
upon
such
commerce
the
instrumentalities
thereof
and
those
engaged
therein
i
earnestly
recommend
this
subject
to
the
consideration
of
the
congress
with
a
view
to
the
passage
of
a
law
reasonable
in
its
provisions
and
effective
in
its
operations
upon
which
the
questions
can
be
finally
adjudicated
that
now
raise
doubts
as
to
the
necessity
of
constitutional
amendment
if
it
prove
impossible
to
accomplish
the
purposes
above
set
forth
by
such
a
law
then
assuredly
we
should
not
shrink
from
amending
the
constitution
so
as
to
secure
beyond
peradventure
the
power
sought
the
congress
has
not
heretofore
made
any
appropriation
for
the
better
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
law
as
it
now
stands
very
much
has
been
done
by
the
department
of
justice
in
securing
the
enforcement
of
this
law
but
much
more
could
be
done
if
the
congress
would
make
a
special
appropriation
for
this
purpose
to
be
expended
under
the
direction
of
the
attorneygeneral
one
proposition
advocated
has
been
the
reduction
of
the
tariff
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
evils
of
the
trusts
which
fall
within
the
category
i
have
described
not
merely
would
this
be
wholly
ineffective
but
the
diversion
of
our
efforts
in
such
a
direction
would
mean
the
abandonment
of
all
intelligent
attempt
to
do
away
with
these
evils
many
of
the
largest
corporations
many
of
th
ose
which
should
certainly
be
included
in
any
proper
scheme
of
regulation
would
not
be
affected
in
the
slightest
degree
by
a
change
in
the
tariff
save
as
such
change
interfered
with
the
general
prosperity
of
the
country
the
only
relation
of
the
tariff
to
big
corporations
as
a
whole
is
that
the
tariff
makes
manufactures
profitable
and
the
tariff
remedy
proposed
would
be
in
effect
simply
to
make
manufactures
unprofitable
to
remove
the
tariff
as
a
punitive
measure
directed
against
trusts
would
inevitably
result
in
ruin
to
the
weaker
competitors
who
are
struggling
against
them
our
aim
should
be
not
by
unwise
tariff
changes
to
give
foreign
products
the
advantage
over
domestic
products
but
by
proper
regulation
to
give
domestic
competition
a
fair
chance
and
this
end
can
not
be
reached
by
any
tariff
changes
which
would
affect
unfavorably
all
domestic
competitors
good
and
bad
alike
the
question
of
regulation
of
the
trusts
stands
apart
from
the
question
of
tariff
revision
stability
of
economic
policy
must
always
be
the
prime
economic
need
of
this
country
this
stability
should
not
be
fossilization
the
country
has
acquiesced
in
the
wisdom
of
the
protectivetariff
principle
it
is
exceedingly
undesirable
that
this
system
should
be
destroyed
or
that
there
should
be
violent
and
radical
changes
therein
our
past
experience
shows
that
great
prosperity
in
this
country
has
always
come
under
a
protective
tariff
and
that
the
country
can
not
prosper
under
fitful
tariff
changes
at
short
intervals
moreover
if
the
tariff
laws
as
a
whole
work
well
and
if
business
has
prospered
under
them
and
is
prospering
it
is
better
to
endure
for
a
time
slight
inconveniences
and
inequalities
in
some
schedules
than
to
upset
business
by
too
quick
and
too
radical
changes
it
is
most
earnestly
to
be
wished
that
we
could
treat
the
tariff
from
the
standpoint
solely
of
our
business
needs
it
is
perhaps
too
much
to
hope
that
partisanship
may
be
entirely
excluded
from
consideration
of
the
subject
but
at
least
it
can
be
made
secondary
to
the
business
interests
of
the
countrythat
is
to
the
interests
of
our
people
as
a
whole
unquestionably
these
business
interests
will
best
be
served
if
together
with
fixity
of
principle
as
regards
the
tariff
we
combine
a
system
which
will
permit
us
from
time
to
time
to
make
the
necessary
reapplication
of
the
principle
to
the
shifting
national
needs
we
must
take
scrupulous
care
that
the
reapplication
shall
be
made
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
not
amount
to
a
dislocation
of
our
system
the
mere
threat
of
which
not
to
speak
of
the
performance
would
produce
paralysis
in
the
business
energies
of
the
community
the
first
consideration
in
making
these
changes
would
of
course
be
to
preserve
the
principle
which
underlies
our
whole
tariff
systemthat
is
the
principle
of
putting
american
business
interests
at
least
on
a
full
equality
with
interests
abroad
and
of
always
allowing
a
sufficient
rate
of
duty
to
more
than
cover
the
difference
between
the
labor
cost
here
and
abroad
the
wellbeing
of
the
wageworker
like
the
wellbeing
of
the
tiller
of
the
soil
should
be
treated
as
an
essential
in
shaping
our
whole
economic
policy
there
must
never
be
any
change
which
will
jeopardize
the
standard
of
comfort
the
standard
of
wages
of
the
american
wageworker
one
way
in
which
the
readjustment
sought
can
be
reached
is
by
reciprocity
treaties
it
is
greatly
to
be
desired
that
such
treaties
may
be
adopted
they
can
be
used
to
widen
our
markets
and
to
give
a
greater
field
for
the
activities
of
our
producers
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
to
secure
in
practical
shape
the
lowering
of
duties
when
they
are
no
longer
needed
for
protection
among
our
own
people
or
when
the
minimum
of
damage
done
may
be
disregarded
for
the
sake
of
the
maximum
of
good
accomplished
if
it
prove
impossible
to
ratify
the
pending
treaties
and
if
there
seem
to
be
no
warrant
for
the
endeavor
to
execute
others
or
to
amend
the
pending
treaties
so
that
they
can
be
ratified
then
the
same
endto
secure
reciprocityshould
be
met
by
direct
legislation
wherever
the
tariff
conditions
are
such
that
a
needed
change
can
not
with
advantage
be
made
by
the
application
of
the
reciprocity
idea
then
it
can
be
made
outright
by
a
lowering
of
duties
on
a
given
product
if
possible
such
change
should
be
made
only
after
the
fullest
consideration
by
practical
experts
who
should
approach
the
subject
from
a
business
standpoint
having
in
view
both
the
particular
interests
affected
and
the
commercial
wellbeing
of
the
people
as
a
whole
the
machinery
for
providing
such
careful
investigation
can
readily
be
supplied
the
executive
department
has
already
at
its
disposal
methods
of
collecting
facts
and
figures
and
if
the
congress
desires
additional
consideration
to
that
which
will
be
given
the
subject
by
its
own
committees
then
a
commission
of
business
experts
can
be
appointed
whose
duty
it
should
be
to
recommend
action
by
the
congress
after
a
deliberate
and
scientific
examination
of
the
various
schedules
as
they
are
affected
by
the
changed
and
changing
conditions
the
unhurried
and
unbiased
report
of
this
commission
would
show
what
changes
should
be
made
in
the
various
schedules
and
how
far
these
changes
could
go
without
also
changing
the
great
prosperity
which
this
country
is
now
enjoying
or
upsetting
its
fixed
economic
policy
the
cases
in
which
the
tariff
can
produce
a
monopoly
are
so
few
as
to
constitute
an
inconsiderable
factor
in
the
question
but
of
course
if
in
any
case
it
be
found
that
a
given
rate
of
duty
does
promote
a
monopoly
which
works
ill
no
protectionist
would
object
to
such
reduction
of
the
duty
as
would
equalize
competition
in
my
judgment
the
tariff
on
anthracite
coal
should
be
removed
and
anthracite
put
actually
where
it
now
is
nominally
on
the
free
list
this
would
have
no
effect
at
all
save
in
crises
but
in
crises
it
might
be
of
service
to
the
people
interest
rates
are
a
potent
factor
in
business
activity
and
in
order
that
these
rates
may
be
equalized
to
meet
the
varying
needs
of
the
seasons
and
of
widely
separated
communities
and
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
financial
stringencies
which
injuriously
affect
legitimate
business
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
an
element
of
elasticity
in
our
monetary
system
banks
are
the
natural
servants
of
commerce
and
upon
them
should
be
placed
as
far
as
practicable
the
burden
of
furnishing
and
maintaining
a
circulation
adequate
to
supply
the
needs
of
our
diversified
industries
and
of
our
domestic
and
foreign
commerce
and
the
issue
of
this
should
be
so
regulated
that
a
sufficient
supply
should
be
always
available
for
the
business
interests
of
the
country
it
would
be
both
unwise
and
unnecessary
at
this
time
to
attempt
to
reconstruct
our
financial
system
which
has
been
the
growth
of
a
century
but
some
additional
legislation
is
i
think
desirable
the
mere
outline
of
any
plan
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
meet
these
requirements
would
transgress
the
appropriate
limits
of
this
communication
it
is
suggested
however
that
all
future
legislation
on
the
subject
should
be
with
the
view
of
encouraging
the
use
of
such
instrumentalities
as
will
automatically
supply
every
legitimate
demand
of
productive
industries
and
of
commerce
not
only
in
the
amount
but
in
the
character
of
circulation
and
of
making
all
kinds
of
money
interchangeable
and
at
the
will
of
the
holder
convertible
into
the
established
gold
standard
i
again
call
your
attention
to
the
need
of
passing
a
proper
immigration
law
covering
the
points
outlined
in
my
message
to
you
at
the
first
session
of
the
present
congress
substantially
such
a
bill
has
already
passed
the
house
how
to
secure
fair
treatment
alike
for
labor
and
for
capital
how
to
hold
in
check
the
unscrupulous
man
whether
employer
or
employee
without
weakening
individual
initiative
without
hampering
and
cramping
the
industrial
development
of
the
country
is
a
problem
fraught
with
great
difficulties
and
one
which
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
solve
on
lines
of
sanity
and
farsighted
common
sense
as
well
as
of
devotion
to
the
right
this
is
an
era
of
federation
and
combination
exactly
as
business
men
find
they
must
often
work
through
corporations
and
as
it
is
a
constant
tendency
of
these
corporations
to
grow
larger
so
it
is
often
necessary
for
laboring
men
to
work
in
federations
and
these
have
become
important
factors
of
modern
industrial
life
both
kinds
of
federation
capitalistic
and
labor
can
do
much
good
and
as
a
necessary
corollary
they
can
both
do
evil
opposition
to
each
kind
of
organization
should
take
the
form
of
opposition
to
whatever
is
bad
in
the
conduct
of
any
given
corporation
or
unionnot
of
attacks
upon
corporations
as
such
nor
upon
unions
as
such
for
some
of
the
most
farreaching
beneficent
work
for
our
people
has
been
accomplished
through
both
corporations
and
unions
each
must
refrain
from
arbitrary
or
tyrannous
interference
with
the
rights
of
others
organized
capital
and
organized
labor
alike
should
remember
that
in
the
long
run
the
interest
of
each
must
be
brought
into
harmony
with
the
interest
of
the
general
public
and
the
conduct
of
each
must
conform
to
the
fundamental
rules
of
obedience
to
the
law
of
individual
freedom
and
of
justice
and
fair
dealing
toward
all
each
should
remember
that
in
addition
to
power
it
must
strive
after
the
realization
of
healthy
lofty
and
generous
ideals
every
employer
every
wageworker
must
be
guaranteed
his
liberty
and
his
right
to
do
as
he
likes
with
his
property
or
his
labor
so
long
as
he
does
not
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
others
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
employer
and
employee
alike
should
endeavor
to
appreciate
each
the
viewpoint
of
the
other
and
the
sure
disaster
that
will
come
upon
both
in
the
long
run
if
either
grows
to
take
as
habitual
an
attitude
of
sour
hostility
and
distrust
toward
the
other
few
people
deserve
better
of
the
country
than
those
representatives
both
of
capital
and
laborand
there
are
many
suchwho
work
continually
to
bring
about
a
good
understanding
of
this
kind
based
upon
wisdom
and
upon
bro
ad
and
kindly
sympathy
between
employers
and
employed
above
all
we
need
to
remember
that
any
kind
of
class
animosity
in
the
political
world
is
if
possible
even
more
wicked
even
more
destructive
to
national
welfare
than
sectional
race
or
religious
animosity
we
can
get
good
government
only
upon
condition
that
we
keep
true
to
the
principles
upon
which
this
nation
was
founded
and
judge
each
man
not
as
a
part
of
a
class
but
upon
his
individual
merits
all
that
we
have
a
right
to
ask
of
any
man
rich
or
poor
whatever
his
creed
his
occupation
his
birthplace
or
his
residence
is
that
he
shall
act
well
and
honorably
by
his
neighbor
and
by
his
country
we
are
neither
for
the
rich
man
as
such
nor
for
the
poor
man
as
such
we
are
for
the
upright
man
rich
or
poor
so
far
as
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
national
government
touch
these
matters
of
general
and
vital
moment
to
the
nation
they
should
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
the
principles
above
set
forth
it
is
earnestly
hoped
that
a
secretary
of
commerce
may
be
created
with
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
the
rapid
multiplication
of
questions
affecting
labor
and
capital
the
growth
and
complexity
of
the
organizations
through
which
both
labor
and
capital
now
find
expression
the
steady
tendency
toward
the
employment
of
capital
in
huge
corporations
and
the
wonderful
strides
of
this
country
toward
leadership
in
the
international
business
world
justify
an
urgent
demand
for
the
creation
of
such
a
position
substantially
all
the
leading
commercial
bodies
in
this
country
have
united
in
requesting
its
creation
it
is
desirable
that
some
such
measure
as
that
which
has
already
passed
the
senate
be
enacted
into
law
the
creation
of
such
a
department
would
in
itself
be
an
advance
toward
dealing
with
and
exercising
supervision
over
the
whole
subject
of
the
great
corporations
doing
an
interstate
business
and
with
this
end
in
view
the
congress
should
endow
the
department
with
large
powers
which
could
be
increased
as
experience
might
show
the
need
i
hope
soon
to
submit
to
the
senate
a
reciprocity
treaty
with
cuba
on
may
last
the
united
states
kept
its
promise
to
the
island
by
formally
vacating
cuban
soil
and
turning
cuba
over
to
those
whom
her
own
people
had
chosen
as
the
first
officials
of
the
new
republic
cuba
lies
at
our
doors
and
whatever
affects
her
for
good
or
for
ill
affects
us
also
so
much
have
our
people
felt
this
that
in
the
platt
amendment
we
definitely
took
the
ground
that
cuba
must
hereafter
have
closer
political
relations
with
us
than
with
any
other
power
thus
in
a
sense
cuba
has
become
a
part
of
our
international
political
system
this
makes
it
necessary
that
in
return
she
should
be
given
some
of
the
benefits
of
becoming
part
of
our
economic
system
it
is
from
our
own
standpoint
a
shortsighted
and
mischievous
policy
to
fail
to
recognize
this
need
moreover
it
is
unworthy
of
a
mighty
and
generous
nation
itself
the
greatest
and
most
successful
republic
in
history
to
refuse
to
stretch
out
a
helping
hand
to
a
young
and
weak
sister
republic
just
entering
upon
its
career
of
independence
we
should
always
fearlessly
insist
upon
our
rights
in
the
face
of
the
strong
and
we
should
with
ungrudging
hand
do
our
generous
duty
by
the
weak
i
urge
the
adoption
of
reciprocity
with
cuba
not
only
because
it
is
eminently
for
our
own
interests
to
control
the
cuban
market
and
by
every
means
to
foster
our
supremacy
in
the
tropical
lands
and
waters
south
of
us
but
also
because
we
of
the
giant
republic
of
the
north
should
make
all
our
sister
nations
of
the
american
continent
feel
that
whenever
they
will
permit
it
we
desire
to
show
ourselves
disinterestedly
and
effectively
their
friend
a
convention
with
great
britain
has
been
concluded
which
will
be
at
once
laid
before
the
senate
for
ratification
providing
for
reciprocal
trade
arrangements
between
the
united
states
and
newfoundland
on
substantially
the
lines
of
the
convention
formerly
negotiated
by
the
secretary
of
state
mr
blaine
i
believe
reciprocal
trade
relations
will
be
greatly
to
the
advantage
of
both
countries
as
civilization
grows
warfare
becomes
less
and
less
the
normal
condition
of
foreign
relations
the
last
century
has
seen
a
marked
diminution
of
wars
between
civilized
powers
wars
with
uncivilized
powers
are
largely
mere
matters
of
international
police
duty
essential
for
the
welfare
of
the
world
wherever
possible
arbitration
or
some
similar
method
should
be
employed
in
lieu
of
war
to
settle
difficulties
between
civilized
nations
although
as
yet
the
world
has
not
progressed
sufficiently
to
render
it
possible
or
necessarily
desirable
to
invoke
arbitration
in
every
case
the
formation
of
the
international
tribunal
which
sits
at
the
hague
is
an
event
of
good
omen
from
which
great
consequences
for
the
welfare
of
all
mankind
may
flow
it
is
far
better
where
possible
to
invoke
such
a
permanent
tribunal
than
to
create
special
arbitrators
for
a
given
purpose
it
is
a
matter
of
sincere
congratulation
to
our
country
that
the
united
states
and
mexico
should
have
been
the
first
to
use
the
good
offices
of
the
hague
court
this
was
done
last
summer
with
most
satisfactory
results
in
the
case
of
a
claim
at
issue
between
us
and
our
sister
republic
it
is
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
this
first
case
will
serve
as
a
precedent
for
others
in
which
not
only
the
united
states
but
foreign
nations
may
take
advantage
of
the
machinery
already
in
existence
at
the
hague
i
commend
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
the
hawaiian
fire
claims
which
were
the
subject
of
careful
investigation
during
the
last
session
the
congress
has
wisely
provided
that
we
shall
build
at
once
an
isthmian
canal
if
possible
at
panama
the
attorneygeneral
reports
that
we
can
undoubtedly
acquire
good
title
from
the
french
panama
canal
company
negotiations
are
now
pending
with
colombia
to
secure
her
assent
to
our
building
the
canal
this
canal
will
be
one
of
the
greatest
engineering
feats
of
the
twentieth
century
a
greater
engineering
feat
than
has
yet
been
accomplished
during
the
history
of
mankind
the
work
should
be
carried
out
as
a
continuing
policy
without
regard
to
change
of
administration
and
it
should
be
begun
under
circumstances
which
will
make
it
a
matter
of
pride
for
all
administrations
to
continue
the
policy
the
canal
will
be
of
great
benefit
to
america
and
of
importance
to
all
the
world
it
will
be
of
advantage
to
us
industrially
and
also
as
improving
our
military
position
it
will
be
of
advantage
to
the
countries
of
tropical
america
it
is
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
all
of
these
countries
will
do
as
some
of
them
have
already
done
with
signal
success
and
will
invite
to
their
shores
commerce
and
improve
their
material
conditions
by
recognizing
that
stability
and
order
are
the
prerequisites
of
successful
development
no
independent
nation
in
america
need
have
the
slightest
fear
of
aggression
from
the
united
states
it
behoves
each
one
to
maintain
order
within
its
own
borders
and
to
discharge
its
just
obligations
to
foreigners
when
this
is
done
they
can
rest
assured
that
be
they
strong
or
weak
they
have
nothing
to
dread
from
outside
interference
more
and
more
the
increasing
interdependence
and
complexity
of
international
political
and
economic
relations
render
it
incumbent
on
all
civilized
and
orderly
powers
to
insist
on
the
proper
policing
of
the
world
during
the
fall
of
a
communication
was
addressed
to
the
secretary
of
state
asking
whether
permission
would
be
granted
by
the
president
to
a
corporation
to
lay
a
cable
from
a
point
on
the
california
coast
to
the
philippine
islands
by
way
of
hawaii
a
statement
of
conditions
or
terms
upon
which
such
corporation
would
undertake
to
lay
and
operate
a
cable
was
volunteered
inasmuch
as
the
congress
was
shortly
to
convene
and
pacificcable
legislation
had
been
the
subject
of
consideration
by
the
congress
for
several
years
it
seemed
to
me
wise
to
defer
action
upon
the
application
until
the
congress
had
first
an
opportunity
to
act
the
congress
adjourned
without
taking
any
action
leaving
the
matter
in
exactly
the
same
condition
in
which
it
stood
when
the
congress
convened
meanwhile
it
appears
that
the
commercial
pacific
cable
company
had
promptly
proceeded
with
preparations
for
laying
its
cable
it
also
made
application
to
the
president
for
access
to
and
use
of
soundings
taken
by
the
u
s
s
nero
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
a
practicable
route
for
a
transpacific
cable
the
company
urging
that
with
access
to
these
soundings
it
could
complete
its
cable
much
sooner
than
if
it
were
required
to
take
soundings
upon
its
own
account
pending
consideration
of
this
subject
it
appeared
important
and
desirable
to
attach
certain
conditions
to
the
permission
to
examine
and
use
the
soundings
if
it
should
be
granted
in
consequence
of
this
solicitation
of
the
cable
company
certain
conditions
were
formulated
upon
which
the
president
was
willing
to
allow
access
to
these
soundings
and
to
consent
to
the
landing
and
laying
of
the
cable
subject
to
any
alterations
or
additions
thereto
imposed
by
the
congress
this
was
deemed
proper
especially
as
it
was
clear
that
a
cable
connection
of
some
kind
with
china
a
foreign
country
was
a
part
of
the
companys
plan
this
course
was
moreover
in
accordance
with
a
line
of
precedents
including
president
grants
action
in
the
case
of
the
first
french
cable
explained
to
the
congress
in
his
annual
message
of
december
and
the
instance
occurring
in
of
the
second
french
cable
from
brest
to
st
pierre
with
a
branch
to
cape
cod
these
conditions
prescribed
among
other
things
a
maximum
rate
for
commercial
messages
and
that
the
company
should
construct
a
line
from
the
philippine
islands
to
china
there
being
at
present
as
is
well
known
a
british
line
from
manila
to
hongkong
the
representatives
of
the
cable
company
kept
these
conditions
long
under
consideration
continuing
in
the
meantime
to
prepare
for
laying
the
cable
they
have
however
at
length
acceded
to
them
and
an
allamerican
line
between
our
pacific
coast
and
the
chinese
empire
by
way
of
honolulu
and
the
philippine
island
s
is
thus
provided
for
and
is
expected
within
a
few
months
to
be
ready
for
business
among
the
conditions
is
one
reserving
the
power
of
the
congress
to
modify
or
repeal
any
or
all
of
them
a
copy
of
the
conditions
is
herewith
transmitted
of
porto
rico
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
the
prosperity
of
the
island
and
the
wisdom
with
which
it
has
been
governed
have
been
such
as
to
make
it
serve
as
an
example
of
all
that
is
best
in
insular
administration
on
july
last
on
the
one
hundred
and
twentysixth
anniversary
of
the
declaration
of
our
independence
peace
and
amnesty
were
promulgated
in
the
philippine
islands
some
trouble
has
since
from
time
to
time
threatened
with
the
mohammedan
moros
but
with
the
late
insurrectionary
filipinos
the
war
has
entirely
ceased
civil
government
has
now
been
introduced
not
only
does
each
filipino
enjoy
such
rights
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
as
he
has
never
before
known
during
the
recorded
history
of
the
islands
but
the
people
taken
as
a
whole
now
enjoy
a
measure
of
selfgovernment
greater
than
that
granted
to
any
other
orientals
by
any
foreign
power
and
greater
than
that
enjoyed
by
any
other
orientals
under
their
own
governments
save
the
japanese
alone
we
have
not
gone
too
far
in
granting
these
rights
of
liberty
and
selfgovernment
but
we
have
certainly
gone
to
the
limit
that
in
the
interests
of
the
philippine
people
themselves
it
was
wise
or
just
to
go
to
hurry
matters
to
go
faster
than
we
are
now
going
would
entail
calamity
on
the
people
of
the
islands
no
policy
ever
entered
into
by
the
american
people
has
vindicated
itself
in
more
signal
manner
than
the
policy
of
holding
the
philippines
the
triumph
of
our
arms
above
all
the
triumph
of
our
laws
and
principles
has
come
sooner
than
we
had
any
right
to
expect
too
much
praise
can
not
be
given
to
the
army
for
what
it
has
done
in
the
philippines
both
in
warfare
and
from
an
administrative
standpoint
in
preparing
the
way
for
civil
government
and
similar
credit
belongs
to
the
civil
authorities
for
the
way
in
which
they
have
planted
the
seeds
of
selfgovernment
in
the
ground
thus
made
ready
for
them
the
courage
the
unflinching
endurance
the
high
soldierly
efficiency
and
the
general
kindheartedness
and
humanity
of
our
troops
have
been
strikingly
manifested
there
now
remain
only
some
fifteen
thousand
troops
in
the
islands
all
told
over
one
hundred
thousand
have
been
sent
there
of
course
there
have
been
individual
instances
of
wrongdoing
among
them
they
warred
under
fearful
difficulties
of
climate
and
surroundings
and
under
the
strain
of
the
terrible
provocations
which
they
continually
received
from
their
foes
occasional
instances
of
cruel
retaliation
occurred
every
effort
has
been
made
to
prevent
such
cruelties
and
finally
these
efforts
have
been
completely
successful
every
effort
has
also
been
made
to
detect
and
punish
the
wrongdoers
after
making
all
allowance
for
these
misdeeds
it
remains
true
that
few
indeed
have
been
the
instances
in
which
war
has
been
waged
by
a
civilized
power
against
semicivilized
or
barbarous
forces
where
there
has
been
so
little
wrongdoing
by
the
victors
as
in
the
philippine
islands
on
the
other
hand
the
amount
of
difficult
important
and
beneficent
work
which
has
been
done
is
wellnigh
incalculable
taking
the
work
of
the
army
and
the
civil
authorities
together
it
may
be
questioned
whether
anywhere
else
in
modern
times
the
world
has
seen
a
better
example
of
real
constructive
statesmanship
than
our
people
have
given
in
the
philippine
islands
high
praise
should
also
be
given
those
filipinos
in
the
aggregate
very
numerous
who
have
accepted
the
new
conditions
and
joined
with
our
representatives
to
work
with
hearty
good
will
for
the
welfare
of
the
islands
the
army
has
been
reduced
to
the
minimum
allowed
by
law
it
is
very
small
for
the
size
of
the
nation
and
most
certainly
should
be
kept
at
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
the
senior
officers
are
given
scant
chance
under
ordinary
conditions
to
exercise
commands
commensurate
with
their
rank
under
circumstances
which
would
fit
them
to
do
their
duty
in
time
of
actual
war
a
system
of
maneuvering
our
army
in
bodies
of
some
little
size
has
been
begun
and
should
be
steadily
continued
without
such
maneuvers
it
is
folly
to
expect
that
in
the
event
of
hostilities
with
any
serious
foe
even
a
small
army
corps
could
be
handled
to
advantage
both
our
officers
and
enlisted
men
are
such
that
we
can
take
hearty
pride
in
them
no
better
material
can
be
found
but
they
must
be
thoroughly
trained
both
as
individuals
and
in
the
mass
the
marksmanship
of
the
men
must
receive
special
attention
in
the
circumstances
of
modern
warfare
the
man
must
act
far
more
on
his
own
individual
responsibility
than
ever
before
and
the
high
individual
efficiency
of
the
unit
is
of
the
utmost
importance
formerly
this
unit
was
the
regiment
it
is
now
not
the
regiment
not
even
the
troop
or
company
it
is
the
individual
soldier
every
effort
must
be
made
to
develop
every
workmanlike
and
soldierly
quality
in
both
the
officer
and
the
enlisted
man
i
urgently
call
your
attention
to
the
need
of
passing
a
bill
providing
for
a
general
staff
and
for
the
reorganization
of
the
supply
departments
on
the
lines
of
the
bill
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
war
last
year
when
the
young
officers
enter
the
army
from
west
point
they
probably
stand
above
their
compeers
in
any
other
military
service
every
effort
should
be
made
by
training
by
reward
of
merit
by
scrutiny
into
their
careers
and
capacity
to
keep
them
of
the
same
high
relative
excellence
throughout
their
careers
the
measure
providing
for
the
reorganization
of
the
militia
system
and
for
securing
the
highest
efficiency
in
the
national
guard
which
has
already
passed
the
house
should
receive
prompt
attention
and
action
it
is
of
great
importance
that
the
relation
of
the
national
guard
to
the
militia
and
volunteer
forces
of
the
united
states
should
be
defined
and
that
in
place
of
our
present
obsolete
laws
a
practical
and
efficient
system
should
be
adopted
provision
should
be
made
to
enable
the
secretary
of
war
to
keep
cavalry
and
artillery
horses
wornout
in
long
performance
of
duty
such
horses
fetch
but
a
trifle
when
sold
and
rather
than
turn
them
out
to
the
misery
awaiting
them
when
thus
disposed
of
it
would
be
better
to
employ
them
at
light
work
around
the
posts
and
when
necessary
to
put
them
painlessly
to
death
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
naval
maneuvers
on
a
large
scale
are
being
held
under
the
immediate
command
of
the
admiral
of
the
navy
constantly
increasing
attention
is
being
paid
to
the
gunnery
of
the
navy
but
it
is
yet
far
from
what
it
should
be
i
earnestly
urge
that
the
increase
asked
for
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
the
appropriation
for
improving
the
markmanship
be
granted
in
battle
the
only
shots
that
count
are
the
shots
that
hit
it
is
necessary
to
provide
ample
funds
for
practice
with
the
great
guns
in
time
of
peace
these
funds
must
provide
not
only
for
the
purchase
of
projectiles
but
for
allowances
for
prizes
to
encourage
the
gun
crews
and
especially
the
gun
pointers
and
for
perfecting
an
intelligent
system
under
which
alone
it
is
possible
to
get
good
practice
there
should
be
no
halt
in
the
work
of
building
up
the
navy
providing
every
year
additional
fighting
craft
we
are
a
very
rich
country
vast
in
extent
of
territory
and
great
in
population
a
country
moreover
which
has
an
army
diminutive
indeed
when
compared
with
that
of
any
other
firstclass
power
we
have
deliberately
made
our
own
certain
foreign
policies
which
demand
the
possession
of
a
firstclass
navy
the
isthmian
canal
will
greatly
increase
the
efficiency
of
our
navy
if
the
navy
is
of
sufficient
size
but
if
we
have
an
inadequate
navy
then
the
building
of
the
canal
would
be
merely
giving
a
hostage
to
any
power
of
superior
strength
the
monroe
doctrine
should
be
treated
as
the
cardinal
feature
of
american
foreign
policy
but
it
would
be
worse
than
idle
to
assert
it
unless
we
intended
to
back
it
up
and
it
can
be
backed
up
only
by
a
thoroughly
good
navy
a
good
navy
is
not
a
provocative
of
war
it
is
the
surest
guaranty
of
peace
each
individual
unit
of
our
navy
should
be
the
most
efficient
of
its
kind
as
regards
both
material
and
personnel
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
world
i
call
your
special
attention
to
the
need
of
providing
for
the
manning
of
the
ships
serious
trouble
threatens
us
if
we
can
not
do
better
than
we
are
now
doing
as
regards
securing
the
services
of
a
sufficient
number
of
the
highest
type
of
sailormen
of
sea
mechanics
the
veteran
seamen
of
our
war
ships
are
of
as
high
a
type
as
can
be
found
in
any
navy
which
rides
the
waters
of
the
world
they
are
unsurpassed
in
daring
in
resolution
in
readiness
in
thorough
knowledge
of
their
profession
they
deserve
every
consideration
that
can
be
shown
them
but
there
are
not
enough
of
them
it
is
no
more
possible
to
improvise
a
crew
than
it
is
possible
to
improvise
a
war
ship
to
build
the
finest
ship
with
the
deadliest
battery
and
to
send
it
afloat
with
a
raw
crew
no
matter
how
brave
they
were
individually
would
be
to
insure
disaster
if
a
foe
of
average
capacity
were
encountered
neither
ships
nor
men
can
be
improvised
when
war
has
begun
we
need
a
thousand
additional
officers
in
order
to
properly
man
the
ships
now
provided
for
and
under
construction
the
classes
at
the
naval
school
at
annapolis
should
be
greatly
enlarged
at
the
same
time
that
we
thus
add
the
officers
where
we
need
them
we
should
facilitate
the
retirement
of
those
at
the
head
of
the
list
whose
usefulness
has
become
impaired
promotion
must
be
fostered
if
the
service
is
to
be
kept
efficient
the
lamentable
scarcity
of
officers
and
the
large
number
of
recruits
and
of
unskilled
men
necessarily
put
aboard
the
new
vessels
as
they
have
been
commissioned
has
thrown
upon
our
officers
and
especially
on
the
lieutenants
and
junior
grades
unusual
labor
and
fatigue
and
has
gravely
strained
their
powers
of
endurance
nor
is
there
sign
of
any
immediate
letup
in
this
strain
it
must
continue
for
some
time
longer
until
mo
re
officers
are
graduated
from
annapolis
and
until
the
recruits
become
trained
and
skillful
in
their
duties
in
these
difficulties
incident
upon
the
development
of
our
war
fleet
the
conduct
of
all
our
officers
has
been
creditable
to
the
service
and
the
lieutenants
and
junior
grades
in
particular
have
displayed
an
ability
and
a
steadfast
cheerfulness
which
entitles
them
to
the
ungrudging
thanks
of
all
who
realize
the
disheartening
trials
and
fatigues
to
which
they
are
of
necessity
subjected
there
is
not
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
at
present
there
seems
not
the
slightest
chance
of
trouble
with
a
foreign
power
we
most
earnestly
hope
that
this
state
of
things
may
continue
and
the
way
to
insure
its
continuance
is
to
provide
for
a
thoroughly
efficient
navy
the
refusal
to
maintain
such
a
navy
would
invite
trouble
and
if
trouble
came
would
insure
disaster
fatuous
selfcomplacency
or
vanity
or
shortsightedness
in
refusing
to
prepare
for
danger
is
both
foolish
and
wicked
in
such
a
nation
as
ours
and
past
experience
has
shown
that
such
fatuity
in
refusing
to
recognize
or
prepare
for
any
crisis
in
advance
is
usually
succeeded
by
a
mad
panic
of
hysterical
fear
once
the
crisis
has
actually
arrived
the
striking
increase
in
the
revenues
of
the
postoffice
department
shows
clearly
the
prosperity
of
our
people
and
the
increasing
activity
of
the
business
of
the
country
the
receipts
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
last
amounted
to
an
increase
of
over
the
preceding
year
the
largest
increase
known
in
the
history
of
the
postal
service
the
magnitude
of
this
increase
will
best
appear
from
the
fact
that
the
entire
postal
receipts
for
the
year
amounted
to
but
rural
freedelivery
service
is
no
longer
in
the
experimental
stage
it
has
become
a
fixed
policy
the
results
following
its
introduction
have
fully
justified
the
congress
in
the
large
appropriations
made
for
its
establishment
and
extension
the
average
yearly
increase
in
postoffice
receipts
in
the
rural
districts
of
the
country
is
about
two
per
cent
we
are
now
able
by
actual
results
to
show
that
where
rural
freedelivery
service
has
been
established
to
such
an
extent
as
to
enable
us
to
make
comparisons
the
yearly
increase
has
been
upward
of
ten
per
cent
on
november
rural
freedelivery
routes
had
been
established
and
were
in
operation
covering
about
onethird
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
available
for
rural
freedelivery
service
there
are
now
awaiting
the
action
of
the
department
petitions
and
applications
for
the
establishment
of
additional
routes
this
shows
conclusively
the
want
which
the
establishment
of
the
service
has
met
and
the
need
of
further
extending
it
as
rapidly
as
possible
it
is
justified
both
by
the
financial
results
and
by
the
practical
benefits
to
our
rural
population
it
brings
the
men
who
live
on
the
soil
into
close
relations
with
the
active
business
world
it
keeps
the
farmer
in
daily
touch
with
the
markets
it
is
a
potential
educational
force
it
enhances
the
value
of
farm
property
makes
farm
life
far
pleasanter
and
less
isolated
and
will
do
much
to
check
the
undesirable
current
from
country
to
city
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
congress
will
make
liberal
appropriations
for
the
continuance
of
the
service
already
established
and
for
its
further
extension
few
subjects
of
more
importance
have
been
taken
up
by
the
congress
in
recent
years
than
the
inauguration
of
the
system
of
nationallyaided
irrigation
for
the
arid
regions
of
the
far
west
a
good
beginning
therein
has
been
made
now
that
this
policy
of
national
irrigation
has
been
adopted
the
need
of
thorough
and
scientific
forest
protection
will
grow
more
rapidly
than
ever
throughout
the
publicland
states
legislation
should
be
provided
for
the
protection
of
the
game
and
the
wild
creatures
generally
on
the
forest
reserves
the
senseless
slaughter
of
game
which
can
by
judicious
protection
be
permanently
preserved
on
our
national
reserves
for
the
people
as
a
whole
should
be
stopped
at
once
it
is
for
instance
a
serious
count
against
our
national
good
sense
to
permit
the
present
practice
of
butchering
off
such
a
stately
and
beautiful
creature
as
the
elk
for
its
antlers
or
tusks
so
far
as
they
are
available
for
agriculture
and
to
whatever
extent
they
may
be
reclaimed
under
the
national
irrigation
law
the
remaining
public
lands
should
be
held
rigidly
for
the
home
builder
the
settler
who
lives
on
his
land
and
for
no
one
else
in
their
actual
use
the
desertland
law
the
timber
and
stone
law
and
the
commutation
clause
of
the
homestead
law
have
been
so
perverted
from
the
intention
with
which
they
were
enacted
as
to
permit
the
acquisition
of
large
areas
of
the
public
domain
for
other
than
actual
settlers
and
the
consequent
prevention
of
settlement
moreover
the
approaching
exhaustion
of
the
public
ranges
has
of
late
led
to
much
discussion
as
to
the
best
manner
of
using
these
public
lands
in
the
west
which
are
suitable
chiefly
or
only
for
grazing
the
sound
and
steady
development
of
the
west
depends
upon
the
building
up
of
homes
therein
much
of
our
prosperity
as
a
nation
has
been
due
to
the
operation
of
the
homestead
law
on
the
other
hand
we
should
recognize
the
fact
that
in
the
grazing
region
the
man
who
corresponds
to
the
homesteader
may
be
unable
to
settle
permanently
if
only
allowed
to
use
the
same
amount
of
pasture
land
that
his
brother
the
homesteader
is
allowed
to
use
of
arable
land
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
fairly
rich
and
wellwatered
soil
or
a
much
smaller
amount
of
irrigated
land
may
keep
a
family
in
plenty
whereas
no
one
could
get
a
living
from
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
dry
pasture
land
capable
of
supporting
at
the
outside
only
one
head
of
cattle
to
every
ten
acres
in
the
past
great
tracts
of
the
public
domain
have
been
fenced
in
by
persons
having
no
title
thereto
in
direct
defiance
of
the
law
forbidding
the
maintenance
or
construction
of
any
such
unlawful
inclosure
of
public
land
for
various
reasons
there
has
been
little
interference
with
such
inclosures
in
the
past
but
ample
notice
has
now
been
given
the
trespassers
and
all
the
resources
at
the
command
of
the
government
will
hereafter
be
used
to
put
a
stop
to
such
trespassing
in
view
of
the
capital
importance
of
these
matters
i
commend
them
to
the
earnest
consideration
of
the
congress
and
if
the
congress
finds
difficulty
in
dealing
with
them
from
lack
of
thorough
knowledge
of
the
subject
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
a
commission
of
experts
specially
to
investigate
and
report
upon
the
complicated
questions
involved
i
especially
urge
upon
the
congress
the
need
of
wise
legislation
for
alaska
it
is
not
to
our
credit
as
a
nation
that
alaska
which
has
been
ours
for
thirtyfive
years
should
still
have
as
poor
a
system
of
laws
as
is
the
case
no
country
has
a
more
valuable
possessionin
mineral
wealth
in
fisheries
furs
forests
and
also
in
land
available
for
certain
kinds
of
farming
and
stockgrowing
it
is
a
territory
of
great
size
and
varied
resources
well
fitted
to
support
a
large
permanent
population
alaska
needs
a
good
land
law
and
such
provisions
for
homesteads
and
preemptions
as
will
encourage
permanent
settlement
we
should
shape
legislation
with
a
view
not
to
the
exploiting
and
abandoning
of
the
territory
but
to
the
building
up
of
homes
therein
the
land
laws
should
be
liberal
in
type
so
as
to
hold
out
inducements
to
the
actual
settler
whom
we
most
desire
to
see
take
possession
of
the
country
the
forests
of
alaska
should
be
protected
and
as
a
secondary
but
still
important
matter
the
game
also
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
imperative
that
the
settlers
should
be
allowed
to
cut
timber
under
proper
regulations
for
their
own
use
laws
should
be
enacted
to
protect
the
alaskan
salmon
fisheries
against
the
greed
which
would
destroy
them
they
should
be
preserved
as
a
permanent
industry
and
food
supply
their
management
and
control
should
be
turned
over
to
the
commission
of
fish
and
fisheries
alaska
should
have
a
delegate
in
the
congress
it
would
be
well
if
a
congressional
committee
could
visit
alaska
and
investigate
its
needs
on
the
ground
in
dealing
with
the
indians
our
aim
should
be
their
ultimate
absorption
into
the
body
of
our
people
but
in
many
cases
this
absorption
must
and
should
be
very
slow
in
portions
of
the
indian
territory
the
mixture
of
blood
has
gone
on
at
the
same
time
with
progress
in
wealth
and
education
so
that
there
are
plenty
of
men
with
varying
degrees
of
purity
of
indian
blood
who
are
absolutely
indistinguishable
in
point
of
social
political
and
economic
ability
from
their
white
associates
there
are
other
tribes
which
have
as
yet
made
no
perceptible
advance
toward
such
equality
to
try
to
force
such
tribes
too
fast
is
to
prevent
their
going
forward
at
all
moreover
the
tribes
live
under
widely
different
conditions
where
a
tribe
has
made
considerable
advance
and
lives
on
fertile
farming
soil
it
is
possible
to
allot
the
members
lands
in
severalty
much
as
is
the
case
with
white
settlers
there
are
other
tribes
where
such
a
course
is
not
desirable
on
the
arid
prairie
lands
the
effort
should
be
to
induce
the
indians
to
lead
pastoral
rather
than
agricultural
lives
and
to
permit
them
to
settle
in
villages
rather
than
to
force
them
into
isolation
the
large
indian
schools
situated
remote
from
any
indian
reservation
do
a
special
and
peculiar
work
of
great
importance
but
excellent
though
these
are
an
immense
amount
of
additional
work
must
be
done
on
the
reservations
themselves
among
the
old
and
above
all
among
the
young
indians
the
first
and
most
important
step
toward
the
absorption
of
the
indian
is
to
teach
him
to
earn
his
living
yet
it
is
not
necessarily
to
be
assumed
that
in
each
community
all
indians
must
become
either
tillers
of
the
soil
or
stock
raisers
their
industries
may
properly
be
diversified
and
those
who
show
special
desire
or
adaptability
for
industrial
or
even
commercial
pursuits
should
be
encouraged
so
far
as
practicable
to
follow
out
each
his
own
bent
every
effort
should
be
made
to
develop
the
indian
along
the
lines
of
natural
apt
itude
and
to
encourage
the
existing
native
industries
peculiar
to
certain
tribes
such
as
the
various
kinds
of
basket
weaving
canoe
building
smith
work
and
blanket
work
above
all
the
indian
boys
and
girls
should
be
given
confident
command
of
colloquial
english
and
should
ordinarily
be
prepared
for
a
vigorous
struggle
with
the
conditions
under
which
their
people
live
rather
than
for
immediate
absorption
into
some
more
highly
developed
community
the
officials
who
represent
the
government
in
dealing
with
the
indians
work
under
hard
conditions
and
also
under
conditions
which
render
it
easy
to
do
wrong
and
very
difficult
to
detect
wrong
consequently
they
should
be
amply
paid
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
a
particularly
high
standard
of
conduct
should
be
demanded
from
them
and
where
misconduct
can
be
proved
the
punishment
should
be
exemplary
in
no
department
of
governmental
work
in
recent
years
has
there
been
greater
success
than
in
that
of
giving
scientific
aid
to
the
farming
population
thereby
showing
them
how
most
efficiently
to
help
themselves
there
is
no
need
of
insisting
upon
its
importance
for
the
welfare
of
the
farmer
is
fundamentally
necessary
to
the
welfare
of
the
republic
as
a
whole
in
addition
to
such
work
as
quarantine
against
animal
and
vegetable
plagues
and
warring
against
them
when
here
introduced
much
efficient
help
has
been
rendered
to
the
farmer
by
the
introduction
of
new
plants
specially
fitted
for
cultivation
under
the
peculiar
conditions
existing
in
different
portions
of
the
country
new
cereals
have
been
established
in
the
semiarid
west
for
instance
the
practicability
of
producing
the
best
types
of
macaroni
wheats
in
regions
of
an
annual
rainfall
of
only
ten
inches
or
thereabouts
has
been
conclusively
demonstrated
through
the
introduction
of
new
rices
in
louisiana
and
texas
the
production
of
rice
in
this
country
has
been
made
to
about
equal
the
home
demand
in
the
southwest
the
possibility
of
regrassing
overstocked
range
lands
has
been
demonstrated
in
the
north
many
new
forage
crops
have
been
introduced
while
in
the
east
it
has
been
shown
that
some
of
our
choicest
fruits
can
be
stored
and
shipped
in
such
a
way
as
to
find
a
profitable
market
abroad
i
again
recommend
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
the
plans
of
the
smithsonian
institution
for
making
the
museum
under
its
charge
worthy
of
the
nation
and
for
preserving
at
the
national
capital
not
only
records
of
the
vanishing
races
of
men
but
of
the
animals
of
this
continent
which
like
the
buffalo
will
soon
become
extinct
unless
specimens
from
which
their
representatives
may
be
renewed
are
sought
in
their
native
regions
and
maintained
there
in
safety
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
only
part
of
our
territory
in
which
the
national
government
exercises
local
or
municipal
functions
and
where
in
consequence
the
government
has
a
free
hand
in
reference
to
certain
types
of
social
and
economic
legislation
which
must
be
essentially
local
or
municipal
in
their
character
the
government
should
see
to
it
for
instance
that
the
hygienic
and
sanitary
legislation
affecting
washington
is
of
a
high
character
the
evils
of
slum
dwellings
whether
in
the
shape
of
crowded
and
congested
tenementhouse
districts
or
of
the
backalley
type
should
never
be
permitted
to
grow
up
in
washington
the
city
should
be
a
model
in
every
respect
for
all
the
cities
of
the
country
the
charitable
and
correctional
systems
of
the
district
should
receive
consideration
at
the
hands
of
the
congress
to
the
end
that
they
may
embody
the
results
of
the
most
advanced
thought
in
these
fields
moreover
while
washington
is
not
a
great
industrial
city
there
is
some
industrialism
here
and
our
labor
legislation
while
it
would
not
be
important
in
itself
might
be
made
a
model
for
the
rest
of
the
nation
we
should
pass
for
instance
a
wise
employersliability
act
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
we
need
such
an
act
in
our
navyyards
railroad
companies
in
the
district
ought
to
be
required
by
law
to
block
their
frogs
the
safetyappliance
law
for
the
better
protection
of
the
lives
and
limbs
of
railway
employees
which
was
passed
in
went
into
full
effect
on
august
it
has
resulted
in
averting
thousands
of
casualties
experience
shows
however
the
necessity
of
additional
legislation
to
perfect
this
law
a
bill
to
provide
for
this
passed
the
senate
at
the
last
session
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
some
such
measure
may
now
be
enacted
into
law
there
is
a
growing
tendency
to
provide
for
the
publication
of
masses
of
documents
for
which
there
is
no
public
demand
and
for
the
printing
of
which
there
is
no
real
necessity
large
numbers
of
volumes
are
turned
out
by
the
government
printing
presses
for
which
there
is
no
justification
nothing
should
be
printed
by
any
of
the
departments
unless
it
contains
something
of
permanent
value
and
the
congress
could
with
advantage
cut
down
very
materially
on
all
the
printing
which
it
has
now
become
customary
to
provide
the
excessive
cost
of
government
printing
is
a
strong
argument
against
the
position
of
those
who
are
inclined
on
abstract
grounds
to
advocate
the
governments
doing
any
work
which
can
with
propriety
be
left
in
private
hands
gratifying
progress
has
been
made
during
the
year
in
the
extension
of
the
merit
system
of
making
appointments
in
the
government
service
it
should
be
extended
by
law
to
the
district
of
columbia
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
our
consular
system
be
established
by
law
on
a
basis
providing
for
appointment
and
promotion
only
in
consequence
of
proved
fitness
through
a
wise
provision
of
the
congress
at
its
last
session
the
white
house
which
had
become
disfigured
by
incongruous
additions
and
changes
has
now
been
restored
to
what
it
was
planned
to
be
by
washington
in
making
the
restorations
the
utmost
care
has
been
exercised
to
come
as
near
as
possible
to
the
early
plans
and
to
supplement
these
plans
by
a
careful
study
of
such
buildings
as
that
of
the
university
of
virginia
which
was
built
by
jefferson
the
white
house
is
the
property
of
the
nation
and
so
far
as
is
compatible
with
living
therein
it
should
be
kept
as
it
originally
was
for
the
same
reasons
that
we
keep
mount
vernon
as
it
originally
was
the
stately
simplicity
of
its
architecture
is
an
expression
of
the
character
of
the
period
in
which
it
was
built
and
is
in
accord
with
the
purposes
it
was
designed
to
serve
it
is
a
good
thing
to
preserve
such
buildings
as
historic
monuments
which
keep
alive
our
sense
of
continuity
with
the
nations
past
the
reports
of
the
several
executive
departments
are
submitted
to
the
congress
with
this
communication

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
congress
assembles
this
year
under
the
shadow
of
a
great
calamity
on
the
sixth
of
september
president
mckinley
was
shot
by
an
anarchist
while
attending
the
panamerican
exposition
at
buffalo
and
died
in
that
city
on
the
fourteenth
of
that
month
of
the
last
seven
elected
presidents
he
is
the
third
who
has
been
murdered
and
the
bare
recital
of
this
fact
is
sufficient
to
justify
grave
alarm
among
all
loyal
american
citizens
moreover
the
circumstances
of
this
the
third
assassination
of
an
american
president
have
a
peculiarly
sinister
significance
both
president
lincoln
and
president
garfield
were
killed
by
assassins
of
types
unfortunately
not
uncommon
in
history
president
lincoln
falling
a
victim
to
the
terrible
passions
aroused
by
four
years
of
civil
war
and
president
garfield
to
the
revengeful
vanity
of
a
disappointed
officeseeker
president
mckinley
was
killed
by
an
utterly
depraved
criminal
belonging
to
that
body
of
criminals
who
object
to
all
governments
good
and
bad
alike
who
are
against
any
form
of
popular
liberty
if
it
is
guaranteed
by
even
the
most
just
and
liberal
laws
and
who
are
as
hostile
to
the
upright
exponent
of
a
free
peoples
sober
will
as
to
the
tyrannical
and
irresponsible
despot
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
president
mckinleys
death
he
was
the
most
widely
loved
man
in
all
the
united
states
while
we
have
never
had
any
public
man
of
his
position
who
has
been
so
wholly
free
from
the
bitter
animosities
incident
to
public
life
his
political
opponents
were
the
first
to
bear
the
heartiest
and
most
generous
tribute
to
the
broad
kindliness
of
nature
the
sweetness
and
gentleness
of
character
which
so
endeared
him
to
his
close
associates
to
a
standard
of
lofty
integrity
in
public
life
he
united
the
tender
affections
and
home
virtues
which
are
allimportant
in
the
makeup
of
national
character
a
gallant
soldier
in
the
great
war
for
the
union
he
also
shone
as
an
example
to
all
our
people
because
of
his
conduct
in
the
most
sacred
and
intimate
of
home
relations
there
could
be
no
personal
hatred
of
him
for
he
never
acted
with
aught
but
consideration
for
the
welfare
of
others
no
one
could
fail
to
respect
him
who
knew
him
in
public
or
private
life
the
defenders
of
those
murderous
criminals
who
seek
to
excuse
their
criminality
by
asserting
that
it
is
exercised
for
political
ends
inveigh
against
wealth
and
irresponsible
power
but
for
this
assassination
even
this
base
apology
cannot
be
urged
president
mckinley
was
a
man
of
moderate
means
a
man
whose
stock
sprang
from
the
sturdy
tillers
of
the
soil
who
had
himself
belonged
among
the
wageworkers
who
had
entered
the
army
as
a
private
soldier
wealth
was
not
struck
at
when
the
president
was
assassinated
but
the
honest
toil
which
is
content
with
moderate
gains
after
a
lifetime
of
unremitting
labor
largely
in
the
service
of
the
public
still
less
was
power
struck
at
in
the
sense
that
power
is
irresponsible
or
centered
in
the
hands
of
any
one
individual
the
blow
was
not
aimed
at
tyranny
or
wealth
it
was
aimed
at
one
of
the
strongest
champions
the
wageworker
has
ever
had
at
one
of
the
most
faithful
representatives
of
the
system
of
public
rights
and
representative
government
who
has
ever
risen
to
public
office
president
mckinley
filled
that
political
office
for
which
the
entire
people
vote
and
no
president
not
even
lincoln
himselfwas
ever
more
earnestly
anxious
to
represent
the
well
thoughtout
wishes
of
the
people
his
one
anxiety
in
every
crisis
was
to
keep
in
closest
touch
with
the
peopleto
find
out
what
they
thought
and
to
endeavor
to
give
expression
to
their
thought
after
having
endeavored
to
guide
that
thought
aright
he
had
just
been
reelected
to
the
presidency
because
the
majority
of
our
citizens
the
majority
of
our
farmers
and
wageworkers
believed
that
he
had
faithfully
upheld
their
interests
for
four
years
they
felt
themselves
in
close
and
intimate
touch
with
him
they
felt
that
he
represented
so
well
and
so
honorably
all
their
ideals
and
aspirations
that
they
wished
him
to
continue
for
another
four
years
to
represent
them
and
this
was
the
man
at
whom
the
assassin
struck
that
there
might
be
nothing
lacking
to
complete
the
judaslike
infamy
of
his
act
he
took
advantage
of
an
occasion
when
the
president
was
meeting
the
people
generally
and
advancing
as
if
to
take
the
hand
outstretched
to
him
in
kindly
and
brotherly
fellowship
he
turned
the
noble
and
generous
confidence
of
the
victim
into
an
opportunity
to
strike
the
fatal
blow
there
is
no
baser
deed
in
all
the
annals
of
crime
the
shock
the
grief
of
the
country
are
bitter
in
the
minds
of
all
who
saw
the
dark
days
while
the
president
yet
hovered
between
life
and
death
at
last
the
light
was
stilled
in
the
kindly
eyes
and
the
breath
went
from
the
lips
that
even
in
mortal
agony
uttered
no
words
save
of
forgiveness
to
his
murderer
of
love
for
his
friends
and
of
faltering
trust
in
the
will
of
the
most
high
such
a
death
crowning
the
glory
of
such
a
life
leaves
us
with
infinite
sorrow
but
with
such
pride
in
what
he
had
accomplished
and
in
his
own
personal
character
that
we
feel
the
blow
not
as
struck
at
him
but
as
struck
at
the
nation
we
mourn
a
good
and
great
president
who
is
dead
but
while
we
mourn
we
are
lifted
up
by
the
splendid
achievements
of
his
life
and
the
grand
heroism
with
which
he
met
his
death
when
we
turn
from
the
man
to
the
nation
the
harm
done
is
so
great
as
to
excite
our
gravest
apprehensions
and
to
demand
our
wisest
and
most
resolute
action
this
criminal
was
a
professed
anarchist
inflamed
by
the
teachings
of
professed
anarchists
and
probably
also
by
the
reckless
utterances
of
those
who
on
the
stump
and
in
the
public
press
appeal
to
the
dark
and
evil
spirits
of
malice
and
greed
envy
and
sullen
hatred
the
wind
is
sowed
by
the
men
who
preach
such
doctrines
and
they
cannot
escape
their
share
of
responsibility
for
the
whirlwind
that
is
reaped
this
applies
alike
to
the
deliberate
demagogue
to
the
exploiter
of
sensationalism
and
to
the
crude
and
foolish
visionary
who
for
whatever
reason
apologizes
for
crime
or
excites
aimless
discontent
the
blow
was
aimed
not
at
this
president
but
at
all
presidents
at
every
symbol
of
government
president
mckinley
was
as
emphatically
the
embodiment
of
the
popular
will
of
the
nation
expressed
through
the
forms
of
law
as
a
new
england
town
meeting
is
in
similar
fashion
the
embodiment
of
the
lawabiding
purpose
and
practice
of
the
people
of
the
town
on
no
conceivable
theory
could
the
murder
of
the
president
be
accepted
as
due
to
protest
against
inequalities
in
the
social
order
save
as
the
murder
of
all
the
freemen
engaged
in
a
town
meeting
could
be
accepted
as
a
protest
against
that
social
inequality
which
puts
a
malefactor
in
jail
anarchy
is
no
more
an
expression
of
social
discontent
than
picking
pockets
or
wifebeating
the
anarchist
and
especially
the
anarchist
in
the
united
states
is
merely
one
type
of
criminal
more
dangerous
than
any
other
because
he
represents
the
same
depravity
in
a
greater
degree
the
man
who
advocates
anarchy
directly
or
indirectly
in
any
shape
or
fashion
or
the
man
who
apologizes
for
anarchists
and
their
deeds
makes
himself
morally
accessory
to
murder
before
the
fact
the
anarchist
is
a
criminal
whose
perverted
instincts
lead
him
to
prefer
confusion
and
chaos
to
the
most
beneficent
form
of
social
order
his
protest
of
concern
for
workingmen
is
outrageous
in
its
impudent
falsity
for
if
the
political
institutions
of
this
country
do
not
afford
opportunity
to
every
honest
and
intelligent
son
of
toil
then
the
door
of
hope
is
forever
closed
against
him
the
anarchist
is
everywhere
not
merely
the
enemy
of
system
and
of
progress
but
the
deadly
foe
of
liberty
if
ever
anarchy
is
triumphant
its
triumph
will
last
for
but
one
red
moment
to
be
succeeded
for
ages
by
the
gloomy
night
of
despotism
for
the
anarchist
himself
whether
he
preaches
or
practices
his
doctrines
we
need
not
have
one
particle
more
concern
than
for
any
ordinary
murderer
he
is
not
the
victim
of
social
or
political
injustice
there
are
no
wrongs
to
remedy
in
his
case
the
cause
of
his
criminality
is
to
be
found
in
his
own
evil
passions
and
in
the
evil
conduct
of
those
who
urge
him
on
not
in
any
failure
by
others
or
by
the
state
to
do
justice
to
him
or
his
he
is
a
malefactor
and
nothing
else
he
is
in
no
sense
in
no
shape
or
way
a
product
of
social
conditions
save
as
a
highwayman
is
produced
by
the
fact
than
an
unarmed
man
happens
to
have
a
purse
it
is
a
travesty
upon
the
great
and
holy
names
of
liberty
and
freedom
to
permit
them
to
be
invoked
in
such
a
cause
no
man
or
body
of
men
preaching
anarchistic
doctrines
should
be
allowed
at
large
any
more
than
if
preaching
the
murder
of
some
specified
private
individual
anarchistic
speeches
writings
and
meetings
are
essentially
seditious
and
treasonable
i
earnestly
recommend
to
the
congress
that
in
the
exercise
of
its
wise
discretion
it
should
take
into
consideration
the
coming
to
this
country
of
anarchists
or
persons
professing
principles
hostile
to
all
government
and
justifying
the
murder
of
those
placed
in
authority
such
individuals
as
those
who
not
long
ago
gathered
in
open
meeting
to
glorify
the
murder
of
king
humbert
of
italy
perpetrate
a
crime
and
the
law
should
ensure
their
rigorous
punishment
they
and
those
like
them
should
be
kept
out
of
this
country
and
if
found
here
they
should
be
promptly
deported
to
the
country
whence
they
came
and
farreaching
provision
should
be
made
for
the
punishment
of
those
who
stay
no
matter
calls
more
urgently
for
the
wisest
thought
of
the
congress
the
federal
courts
should
be
given
jurisdiction
over
any
man
who
kills
or
attempts
to
kill
the
president
or
any
man
who
by
the
constitution
or
by
law
is
in
line
of
succession
for
the
presidency
while
the
punishment
for
an
unsuccessful
attempt
should
be
proportioned
to
the
enormity
of
the
offense
against
our
institutions
anarchy
is
a
crime
against
the
whole
human
race
and
all
mankind
should
band
against
the
anarchist
his
crime
should
be
ma
de
an
offense
against
the
law
of
nations
like
piracy
and
that
form
of
manstealing
known
as
the
slave
trade
for
it
is
of
far
blacker
infamy
than
either
it
should
be
so
declared
by
treaties
among
all
civilized
powers
such
treaties
would
give
to
the
federal
government
the
power
of
dealing
with
the
crime
a
grim
commentary
upon
the
folly
of
the
anarchist
position
was
afforded
by
the
attitude
of
the
law
toward
this
very
criminal
who
had
just
taken
the
life
of
the
president
the
people
would
have
torn
him
limb
from
limb
if
it
had
not
been
that
the
law
he
defied
was
at
once
invoked
in
his
behalf
so
far
from
his
deed
being
committed
on
behalf
of
the
people
against
the
government
the
government
was
obliged
at
once
to
exert
its
full
police
power
to
save
him
from
instant
death
at
the
hands
of
the
people
moreover
his
deed
worked
not
the
slightest
dislocation
in
our
governmental
system
and
the
danger
of
a
recurrence
of
such
deeds
no
matter
how
great
it
might
grow
would
work
only
in
the
direction
of
strengthening
and
giving
harshness
to
the
forces
of
order
no
man
will
ever
be
restrained
from
becoming
president
by
any
fear
as
to
his
personal
safety
if
the
risk
to
the
presidents
life
became
great
it
would
mean
that
the
office
would
more
and
more
come
to
be
filled
by
men
of
a
spirit
which
would
make
them
resolute
and
merciless
in
dealing
with
every
friend
of
disorder
this
great
country
will
not
fall
into
anarchy
and
if
anarchists
should
ever
become
a
serious
menace
to
its
institutions
they
would
not
merely
be
stamped
out
but
would
involve
in
their
own
ruin
every
active
or
passive
sympathizer
with
their
doctrines
the
american
people
are
slow
to
wrath
but
when
their
wrath
is
once
kindled
it
burns
like
a
consuming
flame
during
the
last
five
years
business
confidence
has
been
restored
and
the
nation
is
to
be
congratulated
because
of
its
present
abounding
prosperity
such
prosperity
can
never
be
created
by
law
alone
although
it
is
easy
enough
to
destroy
it
by
mischievous
laws
if
the
hand
of
the
lord
is
heavy
upon
any
country
if
flood
or
drought
comes
human
wisdom
is
powerless
to
avert
the
calamity
moreover
no
law
can
guard
us
against
the
consequences
of
our
own
folly
the
men
who
are
idle
or
credulous
the
men
who
seek
gains
not
by
genuine
work
with
head
or
hand
but
by
gambling
in
any
form
are
always
a
source
of
menace
not
only
to
themselves
but
to
others
if
the
business
world
loses
its
head
it
loses
what
legislation
cannot
supply
fundamentally
the
welfare
of
each
citizen
and
therefore
the
welfare
of
the
aggregate
of
citizens
which
makes
the
nation
must
rest
upon
individual
thrift
and
energy
resolution
and
intelligence
nothing
can
take
the
place
of
this
individual
capacity
but
wise
legislation
and
honest
and
intelligent
administration
can
give
it
the
fullest
scope
the
largest
opportunity
to
work
to
good
effect
the
tremendous
and
highly
complex
industrial
development
which
went
on
with
ever
accelerated
rapidity
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
brings
us
face
to
face
at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
with
very
serious
social
problems
the
old
laws
and
the
old
customs
which
had
almost
the
binding
force
of
law
were
once
quite
sufficient
to
regulate
the
accumulation
and
distribution
of
wealth
since
the
industrial
changes
which
have
so
enormously
increased
the
productive
power
of
mankind
they
are
no
longer
sufficient
the
growth
of
cities
has
gone
on
beyond
comparison
faster
than
the
growth
of
the
country
and
the
upbuilding
of
the
great
industrial
centers
has
meant
a
startling
increase
not
merely
in
the
aggregate
of
wealth
but
in
the
number
of
very
large
individual
and
especially
of
very
large
corporate
fortunes
the
creation
of
these
great
corporate
fortunes
has
not
been
due
to
the
tariff
nor
to
any
other
governmental
action
but
to
natural
causes
in
the
business
world
operating
in
other
countries
as
they
operate
in
our
own
the
process
has
aroused
much
antagonism
a
great
part
of
which
is
wholly
without
warrant
it
is
not
true
that
as
the
rich
have
grown
richer
the
poor
have
grown
poorer
on
the
contrary
never
before
has
the
average
man
the
wageworker
the
farmer
the
small
trader
been
so
well
off
as
in
this
country
and
at
the
present
time
there
have
been
abuses
connected
with
the
accumulation
of
wealth
yet
it
remains
true
that
a
fortune
accumulated
in
legitimate
business
can
be
accumulated
by
the
person
specially
benefited
only
on
condition
of
conferring
immense
incidental
benefits
upon
others
successful
enterprise
of
the
type
which
benefits
all
mankind
can
only
exist
if
the
conditions
are
such
as
to
offer
great
prizes
as
the
rewards
of
success
the
captains
of
industry
who
have
driven
the
railway
systems
across
this
continent
who
have
built
up
our
commerce
who
have
developed
our
manufactures
have
on
the
whole
done
great
good
to
our
people
without
them
the
material
development
of
which
we
are
so
justly
proud
could
never
have
taken
place
moreover
we
should
recognize
the
immense
importance
of
this
material
development
of
leaving
as
unhampered
as
is
compatible
with
the
public
good
the
strong
and
forceful
men
upon
whom
the
success
of
business
operations
inevitably
rests
the
slightest
study
of
business
conditions
will
satisfy
anyone
capable
of
forming
a
judgment
that
the
personal
equation
is
the
most
important
factor
in
a
business
operation
that
the
business
ability
of
the
man
at
the
head
of
any
business
concern
big
or
little
is
usually
the
factor
which
fixes
the
gulf
between
striking
success
and
hopeless
failure
an
additional
reason
for
caution
in
dealing
with
corporations
is
to
be
found
in
the
international
commercial
conditions
of
today
the
same
business
conditions
which
have
produced
the
great
aggregations
of
corporate
and
individual
wealth
have
made
them
very
potent
factors
in
international
commercial
competition
business
concerns
which
have
the
largest
means
at
their
disposal
and
are
managed
by
the
ablest
men
are
naturally
those
which
take
the
lead
in
the
strife
for
commercial
supremacy
among
the
nations
of
the
world
america
has
only
just
begun
to
assume
that
commanding
position
in
the
international
business
world
which
we
believe
will
more
and
more
be
hers
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
this
position
be
not
jeoparded
especially
at
a
time
when
the
overflowing
abundance
of
our
own
natural
resources
and
the
skill
business
energy
and
mechanical
aptitude
of
our
people
make
foreign
markets
essential
under
such
conditions
it
would
be
most
unwise
to
cramp
or
to
fetter
the
youthful
strength
of
our
nation
moreover
it
cannot
too
often
be
pointed
out
that
to
strike
with
ignorant
violence
at
the
interests
of
one
set
of
men
almost
inevitably
endangers
the
interests
of
all
the
fundamental
rule
in
our
national
lifethe
rule
which
underlies
all
othersis
that
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
we
shall
go
up
or
down
together
there
are
exceptions
and
in
times
of
prosperity
some
will
prosper
far
more
and
in
times
of
adversity
some
will
suffer
far
more
than
others
but
speaking
generally
a
period
of
good
times
means
that
all
share
more
or
less
in
them
and
in
a
period
of
hard
times
all
feel
the
stress
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
it
surely
ought
not
to
be
necessary
to
enter
into
any
proof
of
this
statement
the
memory
of
the
lean
years
which
began
in
is
still
vivid
and
we
can
contrast
them
with
the
conditions
in
this
very
year
which
is
now
closing
disaster
to
great
business
enterprises
can
never
have
its
effects
limited
to
the
men
at
the
top
it
spreads
throughout
and
while
it
is
bad
for
everybody
it
is
worst
for
those
farthest
down
the
capitalist
may
be
shorn
of
his
luxuries
but
the
wageworker
may
be
deprived
of
even
bare
necessities
the
mechanism
of
modern
business
is
so
delicate
that
extreme
care
must
be
taken
not
to
interfere
with
it
in
a
spirit
of
rashness
or
ignorance
many
of
those
who
have
made
it
their
vocation
to
denounce
the
great
industrial
combinations
which
are
popularly
although
with
technical
inaccuracy
known
as
trusts
appeal
especially
to
hatred
and
fear
these
are
precisely
the
two
emotions
particularly
when
combined
with
ignorance
which
unfit
men
for
the
exercise
of
cool
and
steady
judgment
in
facing
new
industrial
conditions
the
whole
history
of
the
world
shows
that
legislation
will
generally
be
both
unwise
and
ineffective
unless
undertaken
after
calm
inquiry
and
with
sober
selfrestraint
much
of
the
legislation
directed
at
the
trusts
would
have
been
exceedingly
mischievous
had
it
not
also
been
entirely
ineffective
in
accordance
with
a
wellknown
sociological
law
the
ignorant
or
reckless
agitator
has
been
the
really
effective
friend
of
the
evils
which
he
has
been
nominally
opposing
in
dealing
with
business
interests
for
the
government
to
undertake
by
crude
and
illconsidered
legislation
to
do
what
may
turn
out
to
be
bad
would
be
to
incur
the
risk
of
such
farreaching
national
disaster
that
it
would
be
preferable
to
undertake
nothing
at
all
the
men
who
demand
the
impossible
or
the
undesirable
serve
as
the
allies
of
the
forces
with
which
they
are
nominally
at
war
for
they
hamper
those
who
would
endeavor
to
find
out
in
rational
fashion
what
the
wrongs
really
are
and
to
what
extent
and
in
what
manner
it
is
practicable
to
apply
remedies
all
this
is
true
and
yet
it
is
also
true
that
there
are
real
and
grave
evils
one
of
the
chief
being
overcapitalization
because
of
its
many
baleful
consequences
and
a
resolute
and
practical
effort
must
be
made
to
correct
these
evils
there
is
a
widespread
conviction
in
the
minds
of
the
american
people
that
the
great
corporations
known
as
trusts
are
in
certain
of
their
features
and
tendencies
hurtful
to
the
general
welfare
this
springs
from
no
spirit
of
envy
or
uncharitableness
nor
lack
of
pride
in
the
great
industrial
achievements
that
have
placed
this
country
at
the
head
of
the
nations
struggling
for
commercial
supremacy
it
does
not
rest
upon
a
lack
of
intelligent
appreciation
of
the
necessity
of
meeting
changing
and
changed
conditions
of
trade
with
new
methods
nor
upon
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
combination
of
ca
pital
in
the
effort
to
accomplish
great
things
is
necessary
when
the
worlds
progress
demands
that
great
things
be
done
it
is
based
upon
sincere
conviction
that
combination
and
concentration
should
be
not
prohibited
but
supervised
and
within
reasonable
limits
controlled
and
in
my
judgment
this
conviction
is
right
it
is
no
limitation
upon
property
rights
or
freedom
of
contract
to
require
that
when
men
receive
from
government
the
privilege
of
doing
business
under
corporate
form
which
frees
them
from
individual
responsibility
and
enables
them
to
call
into
their
enterprises
the
capital
of
the
public
they
shall
do
so
upon
absolutely
truthful
representations
as
to
the
value
of
the
property
in
which
the
capital
is
to
be
invested
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
should
be
regulated
if
they
are
found
to
exercise
a
license
working
to
the
public
injury
it
should
be
as
much
the
aim
of
those
who
seek
for
social
betterment
to
rid
the
business
world
of
crimes
of
cunning
as
to
rid
the
entire
body
politic
of
crimes
of
violence
great
corporations
exist
only
because
they
are
created
and
safeguarded
by
our
institutions
and
it
is
therefore
our
right
and
our
duty
to
see
that
they
work
in
harmony
with
these
institutions
the
first
essential
in
determining
how
to
deal
with
the
great
industrial
combinations
is
knowledge
of
the
factspublicity
in
the
interest
of
the
public
the
government
should
have
the
right
to
inspect
and
examine
the
workings
of
the
great
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
business
publicity
is
the
only
sure
remedy
which
we
can
now
invoke
what
further
remedies
are
needed
in
the
way
of
governmental
regulation
or
taxation
can
only
be
determined
after
publicity
has
been
obtained
by
process
of
law
and
in
the
course
of
administration
the
first
requisite
is
knowledge
full
and
completeknowledge
which
may
be
made
public
to
the
world
artificial
bodies
such
as
corporations
and
joint
stock
or
other
associations
depending
upon
any
statutory
law
for
their
existence
or
privileges
should
be
subject
to
proper
governmental
supervision
and
full
and
accurate
information
as
to
their
operations
should
be
made
public
regularly
at
reasonable
intervals
the
large
corporations
commonly
called
trusts
though
organized
in
one
state
always
do
business
in
many
states
often
doing
very
little
business
in
the
state
where
they
are
incorporated
there
is
utter
lack
of
uniformity
in
the
state
laws
about
them
and
as
no
state
has
any
exclusive
interest
in
or
power
over
their
acts
it
has
in
practice
proved
impossible
to
get
adequate
regulation
through
state
action
therefore
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
people
the
nation
should
without
interfering
with
the
power
of
the
states
in
the
matter
itself
also
assume
power
of
supervision
and
regulation
over
all
corporations
doing
an
interstate
business
this
is
especially
true
where
the
corporation
derives
a
portion
of
its
wealth
from
the
existence
of
some
monopolistic
element
or
tendency
in
its
business
there
would
be
no
hardship
in
such
supervision
banks
are
subject
to
it
and
in
their
case
it
is
now
accepted
as
a
simple
matter
of
course
indeed
it
is
probable
that
supervision
of
corporations
by
the
national
government
need
not
go
so
far
as
is
now
the
case
with
the
supervision
exercised
over
them
by
so
conservative
a
state
as
massachusetts
in
order
to
produce
excellent
results
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
no
human
wisdom
could
foretell
the
sweeping
changes
alike
in
industrial
and
political
conditions
which
were
to
take
place
by
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
at
that
time
it
was
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
several
states
were
the
proper
authorities
to
regulate
so
far
as
was
then
necessary
the
comparatively
insignificant
and
strictly
localized
corporate
bodies
of
the
day
the
conditions
are
now
wholly
different
and
wholly
different
action
is
called
for
i
believe
that
a
law
can
be
framed
which
will
enable
the
national
government
to
exercise
control
along
the
lines
above
indicated
profiting
by
the
experience
gained
through
the
passage
and
administration
of
the
interstatecommerce
act
if
however
the
judgment
of
the
congress
is
that
it
lacks
the
constitutional
power
to
pass
such
an
act
then
a
constitutional
amendment
should
be
submitted
to
confer
the
power
there
should
be
created
a
cabinet
officer
to
be
known
as
secretary
of
commerce
and
industries
as
provided
in
the
bill
introduced
at
the
last
session
of
the
congress
it
should
be
his
province
to
deal
with
commerce
in
its
broadest
sense
including
among
many
other
things
whatever
concerns
labor
and
all
matters
affecting
the
great
business
corporations
and
our
merchant
marine
the
course
proposed
is
one
phase
of
what
should
be
a
comprehensive
and
farreaching
scheme
of
constructive
statesmanship
for
the
purpose
of
broadening
our
markets
securing
our
business
interests
on
a
safe
basis
and
making
firm
our
new
position
in
the
international
industrial
world
while
scrupulously
safeguarding
the
rights
of
wageworker
and
capitalist
of
investor
and
private
citizen
so
as
to
secure
equity
as
between
man
and
man
in
this
republic
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
farming
interest
no
one
matter
is
of
such
vital
moment
to
our
whole
people
as
the
welfare
of
the
wageworkers
if
the
farmer
and
the
wageworker
are
well
off
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
all
others
will
be
well
off
too
it
is
therefore
a
matter
for
hearty
congratulation
that
on
the
whole
wages
are
higher
today
in
the
united
states
than
ever
before
in
our
history
and
far
higher
than
in
any
other
country
the
standard
of
living
is
also
higher
than
ever
before
every
effort
of
legislator
and
administrator
should
be
bent
to
secure
the
permanency
of
this
condition
of
things
and
its
improvement
wherever
possible
not
only
must
our
labor
be
protected
by
the
tariff
but
it
should
also
be
protected
so
far
as
it
is
possible
from
the
presence
in
this
country
of
any
laborers
brought
over
by
contract
or
of
those
who
coming
freely
yet
represent
a
standard
of
living
so
depressed
that
they
can
undersell
our
men
in
the
labor
market
and
drag
them
to
a
lower
level
i
regard
it
as
necessary
with
this
end
in
view
to
reenact
immediately
the
law
excluding
chinese
laborers
and
to
strengthen
it
wherever
necessary
in
order
to
make
its
enforcement
entirely
effective
the
national
government
should
demand
the
highest
quality
of
service
from
its
employees
and
in
return
it
should
be
a
good
employer
if
possible
legislation
should
be
passed
in
connection
with
the
interstate
commerce
law
which
will
render
effective
the
efforts
of
different
states
to
do
away
with
the
competition
of
convict
contract
labor
in
the
open
labor
market
so
far
as
practicable
under
the
conditions
of
government
work
provision
should
be
made
to
render
the
enforcement
of
the
eighthour
law
easy
and
certain
in
all
industries
carried
on
directly
or
indirectly
for
the
united
states
government
women
and
children
should
be
protected
from
excessive
hours
of
labor
from
night
work
and
from
work
under
unsanitary
conditions
the
government
should
provide
in
its
contracts
that
all
work
should
be
done
under
fair
conditions
and
in
addition
to
setting
a
high
standard
should
uphold
it
by
proper
inspection
extending
if
necessary
to
the
subcontractors
the
government
should
forbid
all
night
work
for
women
and
children
as
well
as
excessive
overtime
for
the
district
of
columbia
a
good
factory
law
should
be
passed
and
as
a
powerful
indirect
aid
to
such
laws
provision
should
be
made
to
turn
the
inhabited
alleys
the
existence
of
which
is
a
reproach
to
our
capital
city
into
minor
streets
where
the
inhabitants
can
live
under
conditions
favorable
to
health
and
morals
american
wageworkers
work
with
their
heads
as
well
as
their
hands
moreover
they
take
a
keen
pride
in
what
they
are
doing
so
that
independent
of
the
reward
they
wish
to
turn
out
a
perfect
job
this
is
the
great
secret
of
our
success
in
competition
with
the
labor
of
foreign
countries
the
most
vital
problem
with
which
this
country
and
for
that
matter
the
whole
civilized
world
has
to
deal
is
the
problem
which
has
for
one
side
the
betterment
of
social
conditions
moral
and
physical
in
large
cities
and
for
another
side
the
effort
to
deal
with
that
tangle
of
farreaching
questions
which
we
group
together
when
we
speak
of
labor
the
chief
factor
in
the
success
of
each
manwageworker
farmer
and
capitalist
alikemust
ever
be
the
sum
total
of
his
own
individual
qualities
and
abilities
second
only
to
this
comes
the
power
of
acting
in
combination
or
association
with
others
very
great
good
has
been
and
will
be
accomplished
by
associations
or
unions
of
wageworkers
when
managed
with
forethought
and
when
they
combine
insistence
upon
their
own
rights
with
lawabiding
respect
for
the
rights
of
others
the
display
of
these
qualities
in
such
bodies
is
a
duty
to
the
nation
no
less
than
to
the
associations
themselves
finally
there
must
also
in
many
cases
be
action
by
the
government
in
order
to
safeguard
the
rights
and
interests
of
all
under
our
constitution
there
is
much
more
scope
for
such
action
by
the
state
and
the
municipality
than
by
the
nation
but
on
points
such
as
those
touched
on
above
the
national
government
can
act
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
rule
of
brotherhood
remains
as
the
indispensable
prerequisite
to
success
in
the
kind
of
national
life
for
which
we
strive
each
man
must
work
for
himself
and
unless
he
so
works
no
outside
help
can
avail
him
but
each
man
must
remember
also
that
he
is
indeed
his
brothers
keeper
and
that
while
no
man
who
refuses
to
walk
can
be
carried
with
advantage
to
himself
or
anyone
else
yet
that
each
at
times
stumbles
or
halts
that
each
at
times
needs
to
have
the
helping
hand
outstretched
to
him
to
be
permanently
effective
aid
must
always
take
the
form
of
helping
a
man
to
help
himself
and
we
can
all
best
help
ourselves
by
joining
together
in
the
work
that
is
of
common
interest
to
all
our
present
immigration
laws
are
unsatisfactory
we
need
every
honest
and
efficient
immigrant
fitted
to
become
an
am
erican
citizen
every
immigrant
who
comes
here
to
stay
who
brings
here
a
strong
body
a
stout
heart
a
good
head
and
a
resolute
purpose
to
do
his
duty
well
in
every
way
and
to
bring
up
his
children
as
lawabiding
and
godfearing
members
of
the
community
but
there
should
be
a
comprehensive
law
enacted
with
the
object
of
working
a
threefold
improvement
over
our
present
system
first
we
should
aim
to
exclude
absolutely
not
only
all
persons
who
are
known
to
be
believers
in
anarchistic
principles
or
members
of
anarchistic
societies
but
also
all
persons
who
are
of
a
low
moral
tendency
or
of
unsavory
reputation
this
means
that
we
should
require
a
more
thorough
system
of
inspection
abroad
and
a
more
rigid
system
of
examination
at
our
immigration
ports
the
former
being
especially
necessary
the
second
object
of
a
proper
immigration
law
ought
to
be
to
secure
by
a
careful
and
not
merely
perfunctory
educational
test
some
intelligent
capacity
to
appreciate
american
institutions
and
act
sanely
as
american
citizens
this
would
not
keep
out
all
anarchists
for
many
of
them
belong
to
the
intelligent
criminal
class
but
it
would
do
what
is
also
in
point
that
is
tend
to
decrease
the
sum
of
ignorance
so
potent
in
producing
the
envy
suspicion
malignant
passion
and
hatred
of
order
out
of
which
anarchistic
sentiment
inevitably
springs
finally
all
persons
should
be
excluded
who
are
below
a
certain
standard
of
economic
fitness
to
enter
our
industrial
field
as
competitors
with
american
labor
there
should
be
proper
proof
of
personal
capacity
to
earn
an
american
living
and
enough
money
to
insure
a
decent
start
under
american
conditions
this
would
stop
the
influx
of
cheap
labor
and
the
resulting
competition
which
gives
rise
to
so
much
of
bitterness
in
american
industrial
life
and
it
would
dry
up
the
springs
of
the
pestilential
social
conditions
in
our
great
cities
where
anarchistic
organizations
have
their
greatest
possibility
of
growth
both
the
educational
and
economic
tests
in
a
wise
immigration
law
should
be
designed
to
protect
and
elevate
the
general
body
politic
and
social
a
very
close
supervision
should
be
exercised
over
the
steamship
companies
which
mainly
bring
over
the
immigrants
and
they
should
be
held
to
a
strict
accountability
for
any
infraction
of
the
law
there
is
general
acquiescence
in
our
present
tariff
system
as
a
national
policy
the
first
requisite
to
our
prosperity
is
the
continuity
and
stability
of
this
economic
policy
nothing
could
be
more
unwise
than
to
disturb
the
business
interests
of
the
country
by
any
general
tariff
change
at
this
time
doubt
apprehension
uncertainty
are
exactly
what
we
most
wish
to
avoid
in
the
interest
of
our
commercial
and
material
wellbeing
our
experience
in
the
past
has
shown
that
sweeping
revisions
of
the
tariff
are
apt
to
produce
conditions
closely
approaching
panic
in
the
business
world
yet
it
is
not
only
possible
but
eminently
desirable
to
combine
with
the
stability
of
our
economic
system
a
supplementary
system
of
reciprocal
benefit
and
obligation
with
other
nations
such
reciprocity
is
an
incident
and
result
of
the
firm
establishment
and
preservation
of
our
present
economic
policy
it
was
specially
provided
for
in
the
present
tariff
law
reciprocity
must
be
treated
as
the
handmaiden
of
protection
our
first
duty
is
to
see
that
the
protection
granted
by
the
tariff
in
every
case
where
it
is
needed
is
maintained
and
that
reciprocity
be
sought
for
so
far
as
it
can
safely
be
done
without
injury
to
our
home
industries
just
how
far
this
is
must
be
determined
according
to
the
individual
case
remembering
always
that
every
application
of
our
tariff
policy
to
meet
our
shifting
national
needs
must
be
conditioned
upon
the
cardinal
fact
that
the
duties
must
never
be
reduced
below
the
point
that
will
cover
the
difference
between
the
labor
cost
here
and
abroad
the
wellbeing
of
the
wageworker
is
a
prime
consideration
of
our
entire
policy
of
economic
legislation
subject
to
this
proviso
of
the
proper
protection
necessary
to
our
industrial
wellbeing
at
home
the
principle
of
reciprocity
must
command
our
hearty
support
the
phenomenal
growth
of
our
export
trade
emphasizes
the
urgency
of
the
need
for
wider
markets
and
for
a
liberal
policy
in
dealing
with
foreign
nations
whatever
is
merely
petty
and
vexatious
in
the
way
of
trade
restrictions
should
be
avoided
the
customers
to
whom
we
dispose
of
our
surplus
products
in
the
long
run
directly
or
indirectly
purchase
those
surplus
products
by
giving
us
something
in
return
their
ability
to
purchase
our
products
should
as
far
as
possible
be
secured
by
so
arranging
our
tariff
as
to
enable
us
to
take
from
them
those
products
which
we
can
use
without
harm
to
our
own
industries
and
labor
or
the
use
of
which
will
be
of
marked
benefit
to
us
it
is
most
important
that
we
should
maintain
the
high
level
of
our
present
prosperity
we
have
now
reached
the
point
in
the
development
of
our
interests
where
we
are
not
only
able
to
supply
our
own
markets
but
to
produce
a
constantly
growing
surplus
for
which
we
must
find
markets
abroad
to
secure
these
markets
we
can
utilize
existing
duties
in
any
case
where
they
are
no
longer
needed
for
the
purpose
of
protection
or
in
any
case
where
the
article
is
not
produced
here
and
the
duty
is
no
longer
necessary
for
revenue
as
giving
us
something
to
offer
in
exchange
for
what
we
ask
the
cordial
relations
with
other
nations
which
are
so
desirable
will
naturally
be
promoted
by
the
course
thus
required
by
our
own
interests
the
natural
line
of
development
for
a
policy
of
reciprocity
will
be
in
connection
with
those
of
our
productions
which
no
longer
require
all
of
the
support
once
needed
to
establish
them
upon
a
sound
basis
and
with
those
others
where
either
because
of
natural
or
of
economic
causes
we
are
beyond
the
reach
of
successful
competition
i
ask
the
attention
of
the
senate
to
the
reciprocity
treaties
laid
before
it
by
my
predecessor
the
condition
of
the
american
merchant
marine
is
such
as
to
call
for
immediate
remedial
action
by
the
congress
it
is
discreditable
to
us
as
a
nation
that
our
merchant
marine
should
be
utterly
insignificant
in
comparison
to
that
of
other
nations
which
we
overtop
in
other
forms
of
business
we
should
not
longer
submit
to
conditions
under
which
only
a
trifling
portion
of
our
great
commerce
is
carried
in
our
own
ships
to
remedy
this
state
of
things
would
not
merely
serve
to
build
up
our
shipping
interests
but
it
would
also
result
in
benefit
to
all
who
are
interested
in
the
permanent
establishment
of
a
wider
market
for
american
products
and
would
provide
an
auxiliary
force
for
the
navy
ships
work
for
their
own
countries
just
as
railroads
work
for
their
terminal
points
shipping
lines
if
established
to
the
principal
countries
with
which
we
have
dealings
would
be
of
political
as
well
as
commercial
benefit
from
every
standpoint
it
is
unwise
for
the
united
states
to
continue
to
rely
upon
the
ships
of
competing
nations
for
the
distribution
of
our
goods
it
should
be
made
advantageous
to
carry
american
goods
in
americanbuilt
ships
at
present
american
shipping
is
under
certain
great
disadvantages
when
put
in
competition
with
the
shipping
of
foreign
countries
many
of
the
fast
foreign
steamships
at
a
speed
of
fourteen
knots
or
above
are
subsidized
and
all
our
ships
sailing
vessels
and
steamers
alike
cargo
carriers
of
slow
speed
and
mail
carriers
of
high
speed
have
to
meet
the
fact
that
the
original
cost
of
building
american
ships
is
greater
than
is
the
case
abroad
that
the
wages
paid
american
officers
and
seamen
are
very
much
higher
than
those
paid
the
officers
and
seamen
of
foreign
competing
countries
and
that
the
standard
of
living
on
our
ships
is
far
superior
to
the
standard
of
living
on
the
ships
of
our
commercial
rivals
our
government
should
take
such
action
as
will
remedy
these
inequalities
the
american
merchant
marine
should
be
restored
to
the
ocean
the
act
of
march
intended
unequivocally
to
establish
gold
as
the
standard
money
and
to
maintain
at
a
parity
therewith
all
forms
of
money
medium
in
use
with
us
has
been
shown
to
be
timely
and
judicious
the
price
of
our
government
bonds
in
the
worlds
market
when
compared
with
the
price
of
similar
obligations
issued
by
other
nations
is
a
flattering
tribute
to
our
public
credit
this
condition
it
is
evidently
desirable
to
maintain
in
many
respects
the
national
banking
law
furnishes
sufficient
liberty
for
the
proper
exercise
of
the
banking
function
but
there
seems
to
be
need
of
better
safeguards
against
the
deranging
influence
of
commercial
crises
and
financial
panics
moreover
the
currency
of
the
country
should
be
made
responsive
to
the
demands
of
our
domestic
trade
and
commerce
the
collections
from
duties
on
imports
and
internal
taxes
continue
to
exceed
the
ordinary
expenditures
of
the
government
thanks
mainly
to
the
reduced
army
expenditures
the
utmost
care
should
be
taken
not
to
reduce
the
revenues
so
that
there
will
be
any
possibility
of
a
deficit
but
after
providing
against
any
such
contingency
means
should
be
adopted
which
will
bring
the
revenues
more
nearly
within
the
limit
of
our
actual
needs
in
his
report
to
the
congress
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
considers
all
these
questions
at
length
and
i
ask
your
attention
to
the
report
and
recommendations
i
call
special
attention
to
the
need
of
strict
economy
in
expenditures
the
fact
that
our
national
needs
forbid
us
to
be
niggardly
in
providing
whatever
is
actually
necessary
to
our
wellbeing
should
make
us
doubly
careful
to
husband
our
national
resources
as
each
of
us
husbands
his
private
resources
by
scrupulous
avoidance
of
anything
like
wasteful
or
reckless
expenditure
only
by
avoidance
of
spending
money
on
what
is
needless
or
unjustifiable
can
we
legitimately
keep
our
income
to
the
point
required
to
meet
our
needs
that
are
genuine
in
a
measure
was
enacted
for
the
regulation
of
interstate
railways
commonly
known
as
the
interstate
commerce
act
the
cardinal
provisions
of
that
act
were
that
railway
rates
should
be
just
and
reasonable
and
that
all
sh
ippers
localities
and
commodities
should
be
accorded
equal
treatment
a
commission
was
created
and
endowed
with
what
were
supposed
to
be
the
necessary
powers
to
execute
the
provisions
of
this
act
that
law
was
largely
an
experiment
experience
has
shown
the
wisdom
of
its
purposes
but
has
also
shown
possibly
that
some
of
its
requirements
are
wrong
certainly
that
the
means
devised
for
the
enforcement
of
its
provisions
are
defective
those
who
complain
of
the
management
of
the
railways
allege
that
established
rates
are
not
maintained
that
rebates
and
similar
devices
are
habitually
resorted
to
that
these
preferences
are
usually
in
favor
of
the
large
shipper
that
they
drive
out
of
business
the
smaller
competitor
that
while
many
rates
are
too
low
many
others
are
excessive
and
that
gross
preferences
are
made
affecting
both
localities
and
commodities
upon
the
other
hand
the
railways
assert
that
the
law
by
its
very
terms
tends
to
produce
many
of
these
illegal
practices
by
depriving
carriers
of
that
right
of
concerted
action
which
they
claim
is
necessary
to
establish
and
maintain
nondiscriminating
rates
the
act
should
be
amended
the
railway
is
a
public
servant
its
rates
should
be
just
to
and
open
to
all
shippers
alike
the
government
should
see
to
it
that
within
its
jurisdiction
this
is
so
and
should
provide
a
speedy
inexpensive
and
effective
remedy
to
that
end
at
the
same
time
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
our
railways
are
the
arteries
through
which
the
commercial
lifeblood
of
this
nation
flows
nothing
could
be
more
foolish
than
the
enactment
of
legislation
which
would
unnecessarily
interfere
with
the
development
and
operation
of
these
commercial
agencies
the
subject
is
one
of
great
importance
and
calls
for
the
earnest
attention
of
the
congress
the
department
of
agriculture
during
the
past
fifteen
years
has
steadily
broadened
its
work
on
economic
lines
and
has
accomplished
results
of
real
value
in
upbuilding
domestic
and
foreign
trade
it
has
gone
into
new
fields
until
it
is
now
in
touch
with
all
sections
of
our
country
and
with
two
of
the
island
groups
that
have
lately
come
under
our
jurisdiction
whose
people
must
look
to
agriculture
as
a
livelihood
it
is
searching
the
world
for
grains
grasses
fruits
and
vegetables
specially
fitted
for
introduction
into
localities
in
the
several
states
and
territories
where
they
may
add
materially
to
our
resources
by
scientific
attention
to
soil
survey
and
possible
new
crops
to
breeding
of
new
varieties
of
plants
to
experimental
shipments
to
animal
industry
and
applied
chemistry
very
practical
aid
has
been
given
our
farming
and
stockgrowing
interests
the
products
of
the
farm
have
taken
an
unprecedented
place
in
our
export
trade
during
the
year
that
has
just
closed
public
opinion
throughout
the
united
states
has
moved
steadily
toward
a
just
appreciation
of
the
value
of
forests
whether
planted
or
of
natural
growth
the
great
part
played
by
them
in
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
the
national
wealth
is
now
more
fully
realized
than
ever
before
wise
forest
protection
does
not
mean
the
withdrawal
of
forest
resources
whether
of
wood
water
or
grass
from
contributing
their
full
share
to
the
welfare
of
the
people
but
on
the
contrary
gives
the
assurance
of
larger
and
more
certain
supplies
the
fundamental
idea
of
forestry
is
the
perpetuation
of
forests
by
use
forest
protection
is
not
an
end
of
itself
it
is
a
means
to
increase
and
sustain
the
resources
of
our
country
and
the
industries
which
depend
upon
them
the
preservation
of
our
forests
is
an
imperative
business
necessity
we
have
come
to
see
clearly
that
whatever
destroys
the
forest
except
to
make
way
for
agriculture
threatens
our
well
being
the
practical
usefulness
of
the
national
forest
reserves
to
the
mining
grazing
irrigation
and
other
interests
of
the
regions
in
which
the
reserves
lie
has
led
to
a
widespread
demand
by
the
people
of
the
west
for
their
protection
and
extension
the
forest
reserves
will
inevitably
be
of
still
greater
use
in
the
future
than
in
the
past
additions
should
be
made
to
them
whenever
practicable
and
their
usefulness
should
be
increased
by
a
thoroughly
businesslike
management
at
present
the
protection
of
the
forest
reserves
rests
with
the
general
land
office
the
mapping
and
description
of
their
timber
with
the
united
states
geological
survey
and
the
preparation
of
plans
for
their
conservative
use
with
the
bureau
of
forestry
which
is
also
charged
with
the
general
advancement
of
practical
forestry
in
the
united
states
these
various
functions
should
be
united
in
the
bureau
of
forestry
to
which
they
properly
belong
the
present
diffusion
of
responsibility
is
bad
from
every
standpoint
it
prevents
that
effective
cooperation
between
the
government
and
the
men
who
utilize
the
resources
of
the
reserves
without
which
the
interests
of
both
must
suffer
the
scientific
bureaus
generally
should
be
put
under
the
department
of
agriculture
the
president
should
have
by
law
the
power
of
transferring
lands
for
use
as
forest
reserves
to
the
department
of
agriculture
he
already
has
such
power
in
the
case
of
lands
needed
by
the
departments
of
war
and
the
navy
the
wise
administration
of
the
forest
reserves
will
be
not
less
helpful
to
the
interests
which
depend
on
water
than
to
those
which
depend
on
wood
and
grass
the
water
supply
itself
depends
upon
the
forest
in
the
arid
region
it
is
water
not
land
which
measures
production
the
western
half
of
the
united
states
would
sustain
a
population
greater
than
that
of
our
whole
country
today
if
the
waters
that
now
run
to
waste
were
saved
and
used
for
irrigation
the
forest
and
water
problems
are
perhaps
the
most
vital
internal
questions
of
the
united
states
certain
of
the
forest
reserves
should
also
be
made
preserves
for
the
wild
forest
creatures
all
of
the
reserves
should
be
better
protected
from
fires
many
of
them
need
special
protection
because
of
the
great
injury
done
by
live
stock
above
all
by
sheep
the
increase
in
deer
elk
and
other
animals
in
the
yellowstone
park
shows
what
may
be
expected
when
other
mountain
forests
are
properly
protected
by
law
and
properly
guarded
some
of
these
areas
have
been
so
denuded
of
surface
vegetation
by
overgrazing
that
the
ground
breeding
birds
including
grouse
and
quail
and
many
mammals
including
deer
have
been
exterminated
or
driven
away
at
the
same
time
the
waterstoring
capacity
of
the
surface
has
been
decreased
or
destroyed
thus
promoting
floods
in
times
of
rain
and
diminishing
the
flow
of
streams
between
rains
in
cases
where
natural
conditions
have
been
restored
for
a
few
years
vegetation
has
again
carpeted
the
ground
birds
and
deer
are
coming
back
and
hundreds
of
persons
especially
from
the
immediate
neighborhood
come
each
summer
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
camping
some
at
least
of
the
forest
reserves
should
afford
perpetual
protection
to
the
native
fauna
and
flora
safe
havens
of
refuge
to
our
rapidly
diminishing
wild
animals
of
the
larger
kinds
and
free
camping
grounds
for
the
everincreasing
numbers
of
men
and
women
who
have
learned
to
find
rest
health
and
recreation
in
the
splendid
forests
and
flowerclad
meadows
of
our
mountains
the
forest
reserves
should
be
set
apart
forever
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
our
people
as
a
whole
and
not
sacrificed
to
the
shortsighted
greed
of
a
few
the
forests
are
natural
reservoirs
by
restraining
the
streams
in
flood
and
replenishing
them
in
drought
they
make
possible
the
use
of
waters
otherwise
wasted
they
prevent
the
soil
from
washing
and
so
protect
the
storage
reservoirs
from
filling
up
with
silt
forest
conservation
is
therefore
an
essential
condition
of
water
conservation
the
forests
alone
cannot
however
fully
regulate
and
conserve
the
waters
of
the
arid
region
great
storage
works
are
necessary
to
equalize
the
flow
of
streams
and
to
save
the
flood
waters
their
construction
has
been
conclusively
shown
to
be
an
undertaking
too
vast
for
private
effort
nor
can
it
be
best
accomplished
by
the
individual
states
acting
alone
farreaching
interstate
problems
are
involved
and
the
resources
of
single
states
would
often
be
inadequate
it
is
properly
a
national
function
at
least
in
some
of
its
features
it
is
as
right
for
the
national
government
to
make
the
streams
and
rivers
of
the
arid
region
useful
by
engineering
works
for
water
storage
as
to
make
useful
the
rivers
and
harbors
of
the
humid
region
by
engineering
works
of
another
kind
the
storing
of
the
floods
in
reservoirs
at
the
headwaters
of
our
rivers
is
but
an
enlargement
of
our
present
policy
of
river
control
under
which
levees
are
built
on
the
lower
reaches
of
the
same
streams
the
government
should
construct
and
maintain
these
reservoirs
as
it
does
other
public
works
where
their
purpose
is
to
regulate
the
flow
of
streams
the
water
should
be
turned
freely
into
the
channels
in
the
dry
season
to
take
the
same
course
under
the
same
laws
as
the
natural
flow
the
reclamation
of
the
unsettled
arid
public
lands
presents
a
different
problem
here
it
is
not
enough
to
regulate
the
flow
of
streams
the
object
of
the
government
is
to
dispose
of
the
land
to
settlers
who
will
build
homes
upon
it
to
accomplish
this
object
water
must
be
brought
within
their
reach
the
pioneer
settlers
on
the
arid
public
domain
chose
their
homes
along
streams
from
which
they
could
themselves
divert
the
water
to
reclaim
their
holdings
such
opportunities
are
practically
gone
there
remain
however
vast
areas
of
public
land
which
can
be
made
available
for
homestead
settlement
but
only
by
reservoirs
and
mainline
canals
impracticable
for
private
enterprise
these
irrigation
works
should
be
built
by
the
national
government
the
lands
reclaimed
by
them
should
be
reserved
by
the
government
for
actual
settlers
and
the
cost
of
construction
should
so
far
as
possible
be
repaid
by
the
land
reclaimed
the
distribution
of
the
water
the
division
of
the
streams
among
irrigators
should
be
left
to
the
settlers
themselves
in
conformity
with
state
laws
and
without
interference
with
those
laws
or
with
vested
fights
the
policy
of
the
national
government
sho
uld
be
to
aid
irrigation
in
the
several
states
and
territories
in
such
manner
as
will
enable
the
people
in
the
local
communities
to
help
themselves
and
as
will
stimulate
needed
reforms
in
the
state
laws
and
regulations
governing
irrigation
the
reclamation
and
settlement
of
the
arid
lands
will
enrich
every
portion
of
our
country
just
as
the
settlement
of
the
ohio
and
mississippi
valleys
brought
prosperity
to
the
atlantic
states
the
increased
demand
for
manufactured
articles
will
stimulate
industrial
production
while
wider
home
markets
and
the
trade
of
asia
will
consume
the
larger
food
supplies
and
effectually
prevent
western
competition
with
eastern
agriculture
indeed
the
products
of
irrigation
will
be
consumed
chiefly
in
upbuilding
local
centers
of
mining
and
other
industries
which
would
otherwise
not
come
into
existence
at
all
our
people
as
a
whole
will
profit
for
successful
homemaking
is
but
another
name
for
the
upbuilding
of
the
nation
the
necessary
foundation
has
already
been
laid
for
the
inauguration
of
the
policy
just
described
it
would
be
unwise
to
begin
by
doing
too
much
for
a
great
deal
will
doubtless
be
learned
both
as
to
what
can
and
what
cannot
be
safely
attempted
by
the
early
efforts
which
must
of
necessity
be
partly
experimental
in
character
at
the
very
beginning
the
government
should
make
clear
beyond
shadow
of
doubt
its
intention
to
pursue
this
policy
on
lines
of
the
broadest
public
interest
no
reservoir
or
canal
should
ever
be
built
to
satisfy
selfish
personal
or
local
interests
but
only
in
accordance
with
the
advice
of
trained
experts
after
long
investigation
has
shown
the
locality
where
all
the
conditions
combine
to
make
the
work
most
needed
and
fraught
with
the
greatest
usefulness
to
the
community
as
a
whole
there
should
be
no
extravagance
and
the
believers
in
the
need
of
irrigation
will
most
benefit
their
cause
by
seeing
to
it
that
it
is
free
from
the
least
taint
of
excessive
or
reckless
expenditure
of
the
public
moneys
whatever
the
nation
does
for
the
extension
of
irrigation
should
harmonize
with
and
tend
to
improve
the
condition
of
those
now
living
on
irrigated
land
we
are
not
at
the
starting
point
of
this
development
over
two
hundred
millions
of
private
capital
has
already
been
expended
in
the
construction
of
irrigation
works
and
many
million
acres
of
arid
land
reclaimed
a
high
degree
of
enterprise
and
ability
has
been
shown
in
the
work
itself
but
as
much
cannot
be
said
in
reference
to
the
laws
relating
thereto
the
security
and
value
of
the
homes
created
depend
largely
on
the
stability
of
titles
to
water
but
the
majority
of
these
rest
on
the
uncertain
foundation
of
court
decisions
rendered
in
ordinary
suits
at
law
with
a
few
creditable
exceptions
the
arid
states
have
failed
to
provide
for
the
certain
and
just
division
of
streams
in
times
of
scarcity
lax
and
uncertain
laws
have
made
it
possible
to
establish
rights
to
water
in
excess
of
actual
uses
or
necessities
and
many
streams
have
already
passed
into
private
ownership
or
a
control
equivalent
to
ownership
whoever
controls
a
stream
practically
controls
the
land
it
renders
productive
and
the
doctrine
of
private
ownership
of
water
apart
from
land
cannot
prevail
without
causing
enduring
wrong
the
recognition
of
such
ownership
which
has
been
permitted
to
grow
up
in
the
arid
regions
should
give
way
to
a
more
enlightened
and
larger
recognition
of
the
rights
of
the
public
in
the
control
and
disposal
of
the
public
water
supplies
laws
founded
upon
conditions
obtaining
in
humid
regions
where
water
is
too
abundant
to
justify
hoarding
it
have
no
proper
application
in
a
dry
country
in
the
arid
states
the
only
right
to
water
which
should
be
recognized
is
that
of
use
in
irrigation
this
right
should
attach
to
the
land
reclaimed
and
be
inseparable
therefrom
granting
perpetual
water
rights
to
others
than
users
without
compensation
to
the
public
is
open
to
all
the
objections
which
apply
to
giving
away
perpetual
franchises
to
the
public
utilities
of
cities
a
few
of
the
western
states
have
already
recognized
this
and
have
incorporated
in
their
constitutions
the
doctrine
of
perpetual
state
ownership
of
water
the
benefits
which
have
followed
the
unaided
development
of
the
past
justify
the
nations
aid
and
cooperation
in
the
more
difficult
and
important
work
yet
to
be
accomplished
laws
so
vitally
affecting
homes
as
those
which
control
the
water
supply
will
only
be
effective
when
they
have
the
sanction
of
the
irrigators
reforms
can
only
be
final
and
satisfactory
when
they
come
through
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
most
concerned
the
larger
development
which
national
aid
insures
should
however
awaken
in
every
arid
state
the
determination
to
make
its
irrigation
system
equal
in
justice
and
effectiveness
that
of
any
country
in
the
civilized
world
nothing
could
be
more
unwise
than
for
isolated
communities
to
continue
to
learn
everything
experimentally
instead
of
profiting
by
what
is
already
known
elsewhere
we
are
dealing
with
a
new
and
momentous
question
in
the
pregnant
years
while
institutions
are
forming
and
what
we
do
will
affect
not
only
the
present
but
future
generations
our
aim
should
be
not
simply
to
reclaim
the
largest
area
of
land
and
provide
homes
for
the
largest
number
of
people
but
to
create
for
this
new
industry
the
best
possible
social
and
industrial
conditions
and
this
requires
that
we
not
only
understand
the
existing
situation
but
avail
ourselves
of
the
best
experience
of
the
time
in
the
solution
of
its
problems
a
careful
study
should
be
made
both
by
the
nation
and
the
states
of
the
irrigation
laws
and
conditions
here
and
abroad
ultimately
it
will
probably
be
necessary
for
the
nation
to
cooperate
with
the
several
arid
states
in
proportion
as
these
states
by
their
legislation
and
administration
show
themselves
fit
to
receive
it
in
hawaii
our
aim
must
be
to
develop
the
territory
on
the
traditional
american
lines
we
do
not
wish
a
region
of
large
estates
tilled
by
cheap
labor
we
wish
a
healthy
american
community
of
men
who
themselves
till
the
farms
they
own
all
our
legislation
for
the
islands
should
be
shaped
with
this
end
in
view
the
wellbeing
of
the
average
homemaker
must
afford
the
true
test
of
the
healthy
development
of
the
islands
the
land
policy
should
as
nearly
as
possible
be
modeled
on
our
homestead
system
it
is
a
pleasure
to
say
that
it
is
hardly
more
necessary
to
report
as
to
puerto
rico
than
as
to
any
state
or
territory
within
our
continental
limits
the
island
is
thriving
as
never
before
and
it
is
being
administered
efficiently
and
honestly
its
people
are
now
enjoying
liberty
and
order
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states
and
upon
this
fact
we
congratulate
them
and
ourselves
their
material
welfare
must
be
as
carefully
and
jealously
considered
as
the
welfare
of
any
other
portion
of
our
country
we
have
given
them
the
great
gift
of
free
access
for
their
products
to
the
markets
of
the
united
states
i
ask
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
need
of
legislation
concerning
the
public
lands
of
puerto
rico
in
cuba
such
progress
has
been
made
toward
putting
the
independent
government
of
the
island
upon
a
firm
footing
that
before
the
present
session
of
the
congress
closes
this
will
be
an
accomplished
fact
cuba
will
then
start
as
her
own
mistress
and
to
the
beautiful
queen
of
the
antilles
as
she
unfolds
this
new
page
of
her
destiny
we
extend
our
heartiest
greetings
and
good
wishes
elsewhere
i
have
discussed
the
question
of
reciprocity
in
the
case
of
cuba
however
there
are
weighty
reasons
of
morality
and
of
national
interest
why
the
policy
should
be
held
to
have
a
peculiar
application
and
i
most
earnestly
ask
your
attention
to
the
wisdom
indeed
to
the
vital
need
of
providing
for
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
tariff
duties
on
cuban
imports
into
the
united
states
cuba
has
in
her
constitution
affirmed
what
we
desired
that
she
should
stand
in
international
matters
in
closer
and
more
friendly
relations
with
us
than
with
any
other
power
and
we
are
bound
by
every
consideration
of
honor
and
expediency
to
pass
commercial
measures
in
the
interest
of
her
material
wellbeing
in
the
philippines
our
problem
is
larger
they
are
very
rich
tropical
islands
inhabited
by
many
varying
tribes
representing
widely
different
stages
of
progress
toward
civilization
our
earnest
effort
is
to
help
these
people
upward
along
the
stony
and
difficult
path
that
leads
to
selfgovernment
we
hope
to
make
our
administration
of
the
islands
honorable
to
our
nation
by
making
it
of
the
highest
benefit
to
the
filipinos
themselves
and
as
an
earnest
of
what
we
intend
to
do
we
point
to
what
we
have
done
already
a
greater
measure
of
material
prosperity
and
of
governmental
honesty
and
efficiency
has
been
attained
in
the
philippines
than
ever
before
in
their
history
it
is
no
light
task
for
a
nation
to
achieve
the
temperamental
qualities
without
which
the
institutions
of
free
government
are
but
an
empty
mockery
our
people
are
now
successfully
governing
themselves
because
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
they
have
been
slowly
fitting
themselves
sometimes
consciously
sometimes
unconsciously
toward
this
end
what
has
taken
us
thirty
generations
to
achieve
we
cannot
expect
to
have
another
race
accomplish
out
of
hand
especially
when
large
portions
of
that
race
start
very
far
behind
the
point
which
our
ancestors
had
reached
even
thirty
generations
ago
in
dealing
with
the
philippine
people
we
must
show
both
patience
and
strength
forbearance
and
steadfast
resolution
our
aim
is
high
we
do
not
desire
to
do
for
the
islanders
merely
what
has
elsewhere
been
done
for
tropic
peoples
by
even
the
best
foreign
governments
we
hope
to
do
for
them
what
has
never
before
been
done
for
any
people
of
the
tropicsto
make
them
fit
for
selfgovernment
after
the
fashion
of
the
really
free
nations
history
may
safely
be
challenged
to
show
a
single
instance
in
which
a
masterful
race
such
as
ours
having
been
forced
by
the
exigencies
of
war
to
take
possession
of
an
alien
land
has
behaved
to
its
inhabitants
with
the
disinterested
zeal
fo
r
their
progress
that
our
people
have
shown
in
the
philippines
to
leave
the
islands
at
this
time
would
mean
that
they
would
fall
into
a
welter
of
murderous
anarchy
such
desertion
of
duty
on
our
part
would
be
a
crime
against
humanity
the
character
of
governor
taft
and
of
his
associates
and
subordinates
is
a
proof
if
such
be
needed
of
the
sincerity
of
our
effort
to
give
the
islanders
a
constantly
increasing
measure
of
selfgovernment
exactly
as
fast
as
they
show
themselves
fit
to
exercise
it
since
the
civil
government
was
established
not
an
appointment
has
been
made
in
the
islands
with
any
reference
to
considerations
of
political
influence
or
to
aught
else
save
the
fitness
of
the
man
and
the
needs
of
the
service
in
our
anxiety
for
the
welfare
and
progress
of
the
philippines
may
be
that
here
and
there
we
have
gone
too
rapidly
in
giving
them
local
selfgovernment
it
is
on
this
side
that
our
error
if
any
has
been
committed
no
competent
observer
sincerely
desirous
of
finding
out
the
facts
and
influenced
only
by
a
desire
for
the
welfare
of
the
natives
can
assert
that
we
have
not
gone
far
enough
we
have
gone
to
the
very
verge
of
safety
in
hastening
the
process
to
have
taken
a
single
step
farther
or
faster
in
advance
would
have
been
folly
and
weakness
and
might
well
have
been
crime
we
are
extremely
anxious
that
the
natives
shall
show
the
power
of
governing
themselves
we
are
anxious
first
for
their
sakes
and
next
because
it
relieves
us
of
a
great
burden
there
need
not
be
the
slightest
fear
of
our
not
continuing
to
give
them
all
the
liberty
for
which
they
are
fit
the
only
fear
is
test
in
our
overanxiety
we
give
them
a
degree
of
independence
for
which
they
are
unfit
thereby
inviting
reaction
and
disaster
as
fast
as
there
is
any
reasonable
hope
that
in
a
given
district
the
people
can
govern
themselves
selfgovernment
has
been
given
in
that
district
there
is
not
a
locality
fitted
for
selfgovernment
which
has
not
received
it
but
it
may
well
be
that
in
certain
cases
it
will
have
to
be
withdrawn
because
the
inhabitants
show
themselves
unfit
to
exercise
it
such
instances
have
already
occurred
in
other
words
there
is
not
the
slightest
chance
of
our
failing
to
show
a
sufficiently
humanitarian
spirit
the
danger
comes
in
the
opposite
direction
there
are
still
troubles
ahead
in
the
islands
the
insurrection
has
become
an
affair
of
local
banditti
and
marauders
who
deserve
no
higher
regard
than
the
brigands
of
portions
of
the
old
world
encouragement
direct
or
indirect
to
these
insurrectors
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
encouragement
to
hostile
indians
in
the
days
when
we
still
had
indian
wars
exactly
as
our
aim
is
to
give
to
the
indian
who
remains
peaceful
the
fullest
and
amplest
consideration
but
to
have
it
understood
that
we
will
show
no
weakness
if
he
goes
on
the
warpath
so
we
must
make
it
evident
unless
we
are
false
to
our
own
traditions
and
to
the
demands
of
civilization
and
humanity
that
while
we
will
do
everything
in
our
power
for
the
filipino
who
is
peaceful
we
will
take
the
sternest
measures
with
the
filipino
who
follows
the
path
of
the
insurrecto
and
the
ladrone
the
heartiest
praise
is
due
to
large
numbers
of
the
natives
of
the
islands
for
their
steadfast
loyalty
the
macabebes
have
been
conspicuous
for
their
courage
and
devotion
to
the
flag
i
recommend
that
the
secretary
of
war
be
empowered
to
take
some
systematic
action
in
the
way
of
aiding
those
of
these
men
who
are
crippled
in
the
service
and
the
families
of
those
who
are
killed
the
time
has
come
when
there
should
be
additional
legislation
for
the
philippines
nothing
better
can
be
done
for
the
islands
than
to
introduce
industrial
enterprises
nothing
would
benefit
them
so
much
as
throwing
them
open
to
industrial
development
the
connection
between
idleness
and
mischief
is
proverbial
and
the
opportunity
to
do
remunerative
work
is
one
of
the
surest
preventatives
of
war
of
course
no
business
man
will
go
into
the
philippines
unless
it
is
to
his
interest
to
do
so
and
it
is
immensely
to
the
interest
of
the
islands
that
he
should
go
in
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
the
congress
should
pass
laws
by
which
the
resources
of
the
islands
can
be
developed
so
that
franchises
for
limited
terms
of
years
can
be
granted
to
companies
doing
business
in
them
and
every
encouragement
be
given
to
the
incoming
of
business
men
of
every
kind
not
to
permit
this
is
to
do
a
wrong
to
the
philippines
the
franchises
must
be
granted
and
the
business
permitted
only
under
regulations
which
will
guarantee
the
islands
against
any
kind
of
improper
exploitation
but
the
vast
natural
wealth
of
the
islands
must
be
developed
and
the
capital
willing
to
develop
it
must
be
given
the
opportunity
the
field
must
be
thrown
open
to
individual
enterprise
which
has
been
the
real
factor
in
the
development
of
every
region
over
which
our
flag
has
flown
it
is
urgently
necessary
to
enact
suitable
laws
dealing
with
general
transportation
mining
banking
currency
homesteads
and
the
use
and
ownership
of
the
lands
and
timber
these
laws
will
give
free
play
to
industrial
enterprise
and
the
commercial
development
which
will
surely
follow
will
accord
to
the
people
of
the
islands
the
best
proofs
of
the
sincerity
of
our
desire
to
aid
them
i
call
your
attention
most
earnestly
to
the
crying
need
of
a
cable
to
hawaii
and
the
philippines
to
be
continued
from
the
philippines
to
points
in
asia
we
should
not
defer
a
day
longer
than
necessary
the
construction
of
such
a
cable
it
is
demanded
not
merely
for
commercial
but
for
political
and
military
considerations
either
the
congress
should
immediately
provide
for
the
construction
of
a
government
cable
or
else
an
arrangement
should
be
made
by
which
like
advantages
to
those
accruing
from
a
government
cable
may
be
secured
to
the
government
by
contract
with
a
private
cable
company
no
single
great
material
work
which
remains
to
be
undertaken
on
this
continent
is
of
such
consequence
to
the
american
people
as
the
building
of
a
canal
across
the
isthmus
connecting
north
and
south
america
its
importance
to
the
nation
is
by
no
means
limited
merely
to
its
material
effects
upon
our
business
prosperity
and
yet
with
view
to
these
effects
alone
it
would
be
to
the
last
degree
important
for
us
immediately
to
begin
it
while
its
beneficial
effects
would
perhaps
be
most
marked
upon
the
pacific
coast
and
the
gulf
and
south
atlantic
states
it
would
also
greatly
benefit
other
sections
it
is
emphatically
a
work
which
it
is
for
the
interest
of
the
entire
country
to
begin
and
complete
as
soon
as
possible
it
is
one
of
those
great
works
which
only
a
great
nation
can
undertake
with
prospects
of
success
and
which
when
done
are
not
only
permanent
assets
in
the
nations
material
interests
but
standing
monuments
to
its
constructive
ability
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
announce
to
you
that
our
negotiations
on
this
subject
with
great
britain
conducted
on
both
sides
in
a
spirit
of
friendliness
and
mutual
good
will
and
respect
have
resulted
in
my
being
able
to
lay
before
the
senate
a
treaty
which
if
ratified
will
enable
us
to
begin
preparations
for
an
isthmian
canal
at
any
time
and
which
guarantees
to
this
nation
every
right
that
it
has
ever
asked
in
connection
with
the
canal
in
this
treaty
the
old
claytonbulwer
treaty
so
long
recognized
as
inadequate
to
supply
the
base
for
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
a
necessarily
american
ship
canal
is
abrogated
it
specifically
provides
that
the
united
states
alone
shall
do
the
work
of
building
and
assume
the
responsibility
of
safeguarding
the
canal
and
shall
regulate
its
neutral
use
by
all
nations
on
terms
of
equality
without
the
guaranty
or
interference
of
any
outside
nation
from
any
quarter
the
signed
treaty
will
at
once
be
laid
before
the
senate
and
if
approved
the
congress
can
then
proceed
to
give
effect
to
the
advantages
it
secures
us
by
providing
for
the
building
of
the
canal
the
true
end
of
every
great
and
free
people
should
be
selfrespecting
peace
and
this
nation
most
earnestly
desires
sincere
and
cordial
friendship
with
all
others
over
the
entire
world
of
recent
years
wars
between
the
great
civilized
powers
have
become
less
and
less
frequent
wars
with
barbarous
or
semibarbarous
peoples
come
in
an
entirely
different
category
being
merely
a
most
regrettable
but
necessary
international
police
duty
which
must
be
performed
for
the
sake
of
the
welfare
of
mankind
peace
can
only
be
kept
with
certainty
where
both
sides
wish
to
keep
it
but
more
and
more
the
civilized
peoples
are
realizing
the
wicked
folly
of
war
and
are
attaining
that
condition
of
just
and
intelligent
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
which
will
in
the
end
as
we
hope
and
believe
make
worldwide
peace
possible
the
peace
conference
at
the
hague
gave
definite
expression
to
this
hope
and
belief
and
marked
a
stride
toward
their
attainment
this
same
peace
conference
acquiesced
in
our
statement
of
the
monroe
doctrine
as
compatible
with
the
purposes
and
aims
of
the
conference
the
monroe
doctrine
should
be
the
cardinal
feature
of
the
foreign
policy
of
all
the
nations
of
the
two
americas
as
it
is
of
the
united
states
just
seventyeight
years
have
passed
since
president
monroe
in
his
annual
message
announced
that
the
american
continents
are
henceforth
not
to
be
considered
as
subjects
for
future
colonization
by
any
european
power
in
other
words
the
monroe
doctrine
is
a
declaration
that
there
must
be
no
territorial
aggrandizement
by
any
nonamerican
power
at
the
expense
of
any
american
power
on
american
soil
it
is
in
no
wise
intended
as
hostile
to
any
nation
in
the
old
world
still
less
is
it
intended
to
give
cover
to
any
aggression
by
one
new
world
power
at
the
expense
of
any
other
it
is
simply
a
step
and
a
long
step
toward
assuring
the
universal
peace
of
the
world
by
securing
the
possibility
of
permanent
peace
on
this
hemisphere
during
the
past
century
other
influences
have
established
the
permanence
and
independence
of
the
smaller
states
of
europe
through
the
monroe
doctrine
we
hope
to
be
able
to
safeguard
like
independence
and
secure
like
permanence
for

the
lesser
among
the
new
world
nations
this
doctrine
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
commercial
relations
of
any
american
power
save
that
it
in
truth
allows
each
of
them
to
form
such
as
it
desires
in
other
words
it
is
really
a
guaranty
of
the
commercial
independence
of
the
americas
we
do
not
ask
under
this
doctrine
for
any
exclusive
commercial
dealings
with
any
other
american
state
we
do
not
guarantee
any
state
against
punishment
if
it
misconducts
itself
provided
that
punishment
does
not
take
the
form
of
the
acquisition
of
territory
by
any
nonamerican
power
our
attitude
in
cuba
is
a
sufficient
guaranty
of
our
own
good
faith
we
have
not
the
slightest
desire
to
secure
any
territory
at
the
expense
of
any
of
our
neighbors
we
wish
to
work
with
them
hand
in
hand
so
that
all
of
us
may
be
uplifted
together
and
we
rejoice
over
the
good
fortune
of
any
of
them
we
gladly
hail
their
material
prosperity
and
political
stability
and
are
concerned
and
alarmed
if
any
of
them
fall
into
industrial
or
political
chaos
we
do
not
wish
to
see
any
old
world
military
power
grow
up
on
this
continent
or
to
be
compelled
to
become
a
military
power
ourselves
the
peoples
of
the
americas
can
prosper
best
if
left
to
work
out
their
own
salvation
in
their
own
way
the
work
of
upbuilding
the
navy
must
be
steadily
continued
no
one
point
of
our
policy
foreign
or
domestic
is
more
important
than
this
to
the
honor
and
material
welfare
and
above
all
to
the
peace
of
our
nation
in
the
future
whether
we
desire
it
or
not
we
must
henceforth
recognize
that
we
have
international
duties
no
less
than
international
rights
even
if
our
flag
were
hauled
down
in
the
philippines
and
puerto
rico
even
if
we
decided
not
to
build
the
isthmian
canal
we
should
need
a
thoroughly
trained
navy
of
adequate
size
or
else
be
prepared
definitely
and
for
all
time
to
abandon
the
idea
that
our
nation
is
among
those
whose
sons
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
unless
our
commerce
is
always
to
be
carried
in
foreign
bottoms
we
must
have
war
craft
to
protect
it
inasmuch
however
as
the
american
people
have
no
thought
of
abandoning
the
path
upon
which
they
have
entered
and
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
building
of
the
isthmian
canal
is
fast
becoming
one
of
the
matters
which
the
whole
people
are
united
in
demanding
it
is
imperative
that
our
navy
should
be
put
and
kept
in
the
highest
state
of
efficiency
and
should
be
made
to
answer
to
our
growing
needs
so
far
from
being
in
any
way
a
provocation
to
war
an
adequate
and
highly
trained
navy
is
the
best
guaranty
against
war
the
cheapest
and
most
effective
peace
insurance
the
cost
of
building
and
maintaining
such
a
navy
represents
the
very
lightest
premium
for
insuring
peace
which
this
nation
can
possibly
pay
probably
no
other
great
nation
in
the
world
is
so
anxious
for
peace
as
we
are
there
is
not
a
single
civilized
power
which
has
anything
whatever
to
fear
from
aggressiveness
on
our
part
all
we
want
is
peace
and
toward
this
end
we
wish
to
be
able
to
secure
the
same
respect
for
our
rights
from
others
which
we
are
eager
and
anxious
to
extend
to
their
rights
in
return
to
insure
fair
treatment
to
us
commercially
and
to
guarantee
the
safety
of
the
american
people
our
people
intend
to
abide
by
the
monroe
doctrine
and
to
insist
upon
it
as
the
one
sure
means
of
securing
the
peace
of
the
western
hemisphere
the
navy
offers
us
the
only
means
of
making
our
insistence
upon
the
monroe
doctrine
anything
but
a
subject
of
derision
to
whatever
nation
chooses
to
disregard
it
we
desire
the
peace
which
comes
as
of
right
to
the
just
man
armed
not
the
peace
granted
on
terms
of
ignominy
to
the
craven
and
the
weakling
it
is
not
possible
to
improvise
a
navy
after
war
breaks
out
the
ships
must
be
built
and
the
men
trained
long
in
advance
some
auxiliary
vessels
can
be
turned
into
makeshifts
which
will
do
in
default
of
any
better
for
the
minor
work
and
a
proportion
of
raw
men
can
be
mixed
with
the
highly
trained
their
shortcomings
being
made
good
by
the
skill
of
their
fellows
but
the
efficient
fighting
force
of
the
navy
when
pitted
against
an
equal
opponent
will
be
found
almost
exclusively
in
the
war
ships
that
have
been
regularly
built
and
in
the
officers
and
men
who
through
years
of
faithful
performance
of
sea
duty
have
been
trained
to
handle
their
formidable
but
complex
and
delicate
weapons
with
the
highest
efficiency
in
the
late
war
with
spain
the
ships
that
dealt
the
decisive
blows
at
manila
and
santiago
had
been
launched
from
two
to
fourteen
years
and
they
were
able
to
do
as
they
did
because
the
men
in
the
conning
towers
the
gun
turrets
and
the
enginerooms
had
through
long
years
of
practice
at
sea
learned
how
to
do
their
duty
our
present
navy
was
begun
in
at
that
period
our
navy
consisted
of
a
collection
of
antiquated
wooden
ships
already
almost
as
out
of
place
against
modern
war
vessels
as
the
galleys
of
alcibiades
and
hamilcarcertainly
as
the
ships
of
tromp
and
blake
nor
at
that
time
did
we
have
men
fit
to
handle
a
modern
manofwar
under
the
wise
legislation
of
the
congress
and
the
successful
administration
of
a
succession
of
patriotic
secretaries
of
the
navy
belonging
to
both
political
parties
the
work
of
upbuilding
the
navy
went
on
and
ships
equal
to
any
in
the
world
of
their
kind
were
continually
added
and
what
was
even
more
important
these
ships
were
exercised
at
sea
singly
and
in
squadrons
until
the
men
aboard
them
were
able
to
get
the
best
possible
service
out
of
them
the
result
was
seen
in
the
short
war
with
spain
which
was
decided
with
such
rapidity
because
of
the
infinitely
greater
preparedness
of
our
navy
than
of
the
spanish
navy
while
awarding
the
fullest
honor
to
the
men
who
actually
commanded
and
manned
the
ships
which
destroyed
the
spanish
sea
forces
in
the
philippines
and
in
cuba
we
must
not
forget
that
an
equal
meed
of
praise
belongs
to
those
without
whom
neither
blow
could
have
been
struck
the
congressmen
who
voted
years
in
advance
the
money
to
lay
down
the
ships
to
build
the
guns
to
buy
the
armorplate
the
department
officials
and
the
business
men
and
wageworkers
who
furnished
what
the
congress
had
authorized
the
secretaries
of
the
navy
who
asked
for
and
expended
the
appropriations
and
finally
the
officers
who
in
fair
weather
and
foul
on
actual
sea
service
trained
and
disciplined
the
crews
of
the
ships
when
there
was
no
war
in
sightall
are
entitled
to
a
full
share
in
the
glory
of
manila
and
santiago
and
the
respect
accorded
by
every
true
american
to
those
who
wrought
such
signal
triumph
for
our
country
it
was
forethought
and
preparation
which
secured
us
the
overwhelming
triumph
of
if
we
fail
to
show
forethought
and
preparation
now
there
may
come
a
time
when
disaster
will
befall
us
instead
of
triumph
and
should
this
time
come
the
fault
will
rest
primarily
not
upon
those
whom
the
accident
of
events
puts
in
supreme
command
at
the
moment
but
upon
those
who
have
failed
to
prepare
in
advance
there
should
be
no
cessation
in
the
work
of
completing
our
navy
so
far
ingenuity
has
been
wholly
unable
to
devise
a
substitute
for
the
great
war
craft
whose
hammering
guns
beat
out
the
mastery
of
the
high
seas
it
is
unsafe
and
unwise
not
to
provide
this
year
for
several
additional
battle
ships
and
heavy
armored
cruisers
with
auxiliary
and
lighter
craft
in
proportion
for
the
exact
numbers
and
character
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
but
there
is
something
we
need
even
more
than
additional
ships
and
this
is
additional
officers
and
men
to
provide
battle
ships
and
cruisers
and
then
lay
them
up
with
the
expectation
of
leaving
them
unmanned
until
they
are
needed
in
actual
war
would
be
worse
than
folly
it
would
be
a
crime
against
the
nation
to
send
any
war
ship
against
a
competent
enemy
unless
those
aboard
it
have
been
trained
by
years
of
actual
sea
service
including
incessant
gunnery
practice
would
be
to
invite
not
merely
disaster
but
the
bitterest
shame
and
humiliation
four
thousand
additional
seamen
and
one
thousand
additional
marines
should
be
provided
and
an
increase
in
the
officers
should
be
provided
by
making
a
large
addition
to
the
classes
at
annapolis
there
is
one
small
matter
which
should
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
annapolis
the
pretentious
and
unmeaning
title
of
naval
cadet
should
be
abolished
the
title
of
midshipman
full
of
historic
association
should
be
restored
even
in
time
of
peace
a
war
ship
should
be
used
until
it
wears
out
for
only
so
can
it
be
kept
fit
to
respond
to
any
emergency
the
officers
and
men
alike
should
be
kept
as
much
as
possible
on
blue
water
for
it
is
there
only
they
can
learn
their
duties
as
they
should
be
learned
the
big
vessels
should
be
manoeuvred
in
squadrons
containing
not
merely
battle
ships
but
the
necessary
proportion
of
cruisers
and
scouts
the
torpedo
boats
should
be
handled
by
the
younger
officers
in
such
manner
as
will
best
fit
the
latter
to
take
responsibility
and
meet
the
emergencies
of
actual
warfare
every
detail
ashore
which
can
be
performed
by
a
civilian
should
be
so
performed
the
officer
being
kept
for
his
special
duty
in
the
sea
service
above
all
gunnery
practice
should
be
unceasing
it
is
important
to
have
our
navy
of
adequate
size
but
it
is
even
more
important
that
ship
for
ship
it
should
equal
in
efficiency
any
navy
in
the
world
this
is
possible
only
with
highly
drilled
crews
and
officers
and
this
in
turn
imperatively
demands
continuous
and
progressive
instruction
in
target
practice
ship
handling
squadron
tactics
and
general
discipline
our
ships
must
be
assembled
in
squadrons
actively
cruising
away
from
harbors
and
never
long
at
anchor
the
resulting
wear
upon
engines
and
hulls
must
be
endured
a
battle
ship
worn
out
in
long
training
of
officers
and
men
is
well
paid
for
by
the
results
while
on
the
other
hand
no
matter
in
how
excellent
condition
it
is
useless
if
the
crew
be
not
expert
we
now
have
seventeen
battle
ships
appropriated
for
of
which
nine
are
completed
and
have
been
commissioned
for
actual
service
the
remaining
eight
will
be
ready
in
from
two
to
four
years
but
it
will
take
at
least
that

time
to
recruit
and
train
the
men
to
fight
them
it
is
of
vast
concern
that
we
have
trained
crews
ready
for
the
vessels
by
the
time
they
are
commissioned
good
ships
and
good
guns
are
simply
good
weapons
and
the
best
weapons
are
useless
save
in
the
hands
of
men
who
know
how
to
fight
with
them
the
men
must
be
trained
and
drilled
under
a
thorough
and
wellplanned
system
of
progressive
instruction
while
the
recruiting
must
be
carried
on
with
still
greater
vigor
every
effort
must
be
made
to
exalt
the
main
function
of
the
officerthe
command
of
men
the
leading
graduates
of
the
naval
academy
should
be
assigned
to
the
combatant
branches
the
line
and
marines
many
of
the
essentials
of
success
are
already
recognized
by
the
general
board
which
as
the
central
office
of
a
growing
staff
is
moving
steadily
toward
a
proper
war
efficiency
and
a
proper
efficiency
of
the
whole
navy
under
the
secretary
this
general
board
by
fostering
the
creation
of
a
general
staff
is
providing
for
the
official
and
then
the
general
recognition
of
our
altered
conditions
as
a
nation
and
of
the
true
meaning
of
a
great
war
fleet
which
meaning
is

and
second
the
best

p
the
naval

forces
are
state
organizations
and
are
trained
for
coast
service
and
in
event
of
war
they
will
constitute
the
inner
line
of
defense
they
should
receive
hearty
encouragement
from
the
general
government
but
in
addition
we
should
at
once
provide
for
a
national
naval
reserve
organized
and
trained
under
the
direction
of
the
navy
department
and
subject
to
the
call
of
the
chief
executive
whenever
war
becomes
imminent
it
should
be
a
real
auxiliary
to
the

peace
establishment
and
offer
material
to
be
drawn
on
at
once
for
manning
our

in

it
should
be
composed
of

of

of

longshore
schooners

vessels
and
steam
yachts
together
with
the
coast
population
about
such
centers
as
lifesaving
stations
and
lighthouses
the
american
people
must
either
build
and
maintain
an
adequate
navy
or
else
make
up
their
minds
definitely
to
accept
a
secondary
position
in
international
affairs
not
merely
in
political
but
in
commercial
matters
it
has
been
well
said
that
there
is
no
surer
way
of
courting
national
disaster
than
to
be
opulent
aggressive
and
unarmed
it
is
not
necessary
to
increase
our
army
beyond
its
present
size
at
this
time
but
it
is
necessary
to
keep
it
at
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
the
individual
units
who
as
officers
and
enlisted
men
compose
this
army
are
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
at
least
as
efficient
as
those
of
any
other
army
in
the
entire
world
it
is
our
duty
to
see
that
their
training
is
of
a
kind
to
insure
the
highest
possible
expression
of
power
to
these
units
when
acting
in
combination
the
conditions
of
modern
war
are
such
as
to
make
an
infinitely
heavier
demand
than
ever
before
upon
the
individual
character
and
capacity
of
the
officer
and
the
enlisted
man
and
to
make
it
far
more
difficult
for
men
to
act
together
with
effect
at
present
the
fighting
must
be
done
in
extended
order
which
means
that
each
man
must
act
for
himself
and
at
the
same
time
act
in
combination
with
others
with
whom
he
is
no
longer
in
the
oldfashioned
elbowtoelbow
touch
under
such
conditions
a
few
men
of
the
highest
excellence
are
worth
more
than
many
men
without
the
special
skill
which
is
only
found
as
the
result
of
special
training
applied
to
men
of
exceptional
physique
and
morale
but
nowadays
the
most
valuable
fighting
man
and
the
most
difficult
to
perfect
is
the
rifleman
who
is
also
a
skillful
and
daring
rider
the
proportion
of
our
cavalry
regiments
has
wisely
been
increased
the
american
cavalryman
trained
to
manoeuvre
and
fight
with
equal
facility
on
foot
and
on
horseback
is
the
best
type
of
soldier
for
general
purposes
now
to
be
found
in
the
world
the
ideal
cavalryman
of
the
present
day
is
a
man
who
can
fight
on
foot
as
effectively
as
the
best
infantryman
and
who
is
in
addition
unsurpassed
in
the
care
and
management
of
his
horse
and
in
his
ability
to
fight
on
horseback
a
general
staff
should
be
created
as
for
the
present
staff
and
supply
departments
they
should
be
filled
by
details
from
the
line
the
men
so
detailed
returning
after
a
while
to
their
line
duties
it
is
very
undesirable
to
have
the
senior
grades
of
the
army
composed
of
men
who
have
come
to
fill
the
positions
by
the
mere
fact
of
seniority
a
system
should
be
adopted
by
which
there
shall
be
an
elimination
grade
by
grade
of
those
who
seem
unfit
to
render
the
best
service
in
the
next
grade
justice
to
the
veterans
of
the
civil
war
who
are
still
in
the
army
would
seem
to
require
that
in
the
matter
of
retirements
they
be
given
by
law
the
same
privileges
accorded
to
their
comrades
in
the
navy
the
process
of
elimination
of
the
least
fit
should
be
conducted
in
a
manner
that
would
render
it
practically
impossible
to
apply
political
or
social
pressure
on
behalf
of
any
candidate
so
that
each
man
may
be
judged
purely
on
his
own
merits
pressure
for
the
promotion
of
civil
officials
for
political
reasons
is
bad
enough
but
it
is
tenfold
worse
where
applied
on
behalf
of
officers
of
the
army
or
navy
every
promotion
and
every
detail
under
the
war
department
must
be
made
solely
with
regard
to
the
good
of
the
service
and
to
the
capacity
and
merit
of
the
man
himself
no
pressure
political
social
or
personal
of
any
kind
will
be
permitted
to
exercise
the
least
effect
in
any
question
of
promotion
or
detail
and
if
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
such
pressure
is
exercised
at
the
instigation
of
the
officer
concerned
it
will
be
held
to
militate
against
him
in
our
army
we
cannot
afford
to
have
rewards
or
duties
distributed
save
on
the
simple
ground
that
those
who
by
their
own
merits
are
entitled
to
the
rewards
get
them
and
that
those
who
are
peculiarly
fit
to
do
the
duties
are
chosen
to
perform
them
every
effort
should
be
made
to
bring
the
army
to
a
constantly
increasing
state
of
efficiency
when
on
actual
service
no
work
save
that
directly
in
the
line
of
such
service
should
be
required
the
paper
work
in
the
army
as
in
the
navy
should
be
greatly
reduced
what
is
needed
is
proved
power
of
command
and
capacity
to
work
well
in
the
field
constant
care
is
necessary
to
prevent
dry
rot
in
the
transportation
and
commissary
departments
our
army
is
so
small
and
so
much
scattered
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
give
the
higher
officers
as
well
as
the
lower
officers
and
the
enlisted
men
a
chance
to
practice
manoeuvres
in
mass
and
on
a
comparatively
large
scale
in
time
of
need
no
amount
of
individual
excellence
would
avail
against
the
paralysis
which
would
follow
inability
to
work
as
a
coherent
whole
under
skillful
and
daring
leadership
the
congress
should
provide
means
whereby
it
will
be
possible
to
have
field
exercises
by
at
least
a
division
of
regulars
and
if
possible
also
a
division
of
national
guardsmen
once
a
year
these
exercises
might
take
the
form
of
field
manoeuvres
or
if
on
the
gulf
coast
or
the
pacific
or
atlantic
seaboard
or
in
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
the
army
corps
when
assembled
could
be
marched
from
some
inland
point
to
some
point
on
the
water
there
embarked
disembarked
after
a
couple
of
days
journey
at
some
other
point
and
again
marched
inland
only
by
actual
handling
and
providing
for
men
in
masses
while
they
are
marching
camping
embarking
and
disembarking
will
it
be
possible
to
train
the
higher
officers
to
perform
their
duties
well
and
smoothly
a
great
debt
is
owing
from
the
public
to
the
men
of
the
army
and
navy
they
should
be
so
treated
as
to
enable
them
to
reach
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
so
that
they
may
be
able
to
respond
instantly
to
any
demand
made
upon
them
to
sustain
the
interests
of
the
nation
and
the
honor
of
the
flag
the
individual
american
enlisted
man
is
probably
on
the
whole
a
more
formidable
fighting
man
than
the
regular
of
any
other
army
every
consideration
should
be
shown
him
and
in
return
the
highest
standard
of
usefulness
should
be
exacted
from
him
it
is
well
worth
while
for
the
congress
to
consider
whether
the
pay
of
enlisted
men
upon
second
and
subsequent
enlistments
should
not
be
increased
to
correspond
with
the
increased
value
of
the
veteran
soldier
much
good
has
already
come
from
the
act
reorganizing
the
army
passed
early
in
the
present
year
the
three
prime
reforms
all
of
them
of
literally
inestimable
value
are
first
the
substitution
of
fouryear
details
from
the
line
for
permanent
appointments
in
the
socalled
staff
divisions
second
the
establishment
of
a
corps
of
artillery
with
a
chief
at
the
head
third
the
establishment
of
a
maximum
and
minimum
limit
for
the
army
it
would
be
difficult
to
overestimate
the
improvement
in
the
efficiency
of
our
army
which
these
three
reforms
are
making
and
have
in
part
already
effected
the
reorganization
provided
for
by
the
act
has
been
substantially
accomplished
the
improved
conditions
in
the
philippines
have
enabled
the
war
department
materially
to
reduce
the
military
charge
upon
our
revenue
and
to
arrange
the
number
of
soldiers
so
as
to
bring
this
number
much
nearer
to
the
minimum
than
to
the
maximum
limit
established
by
law
there
is
however
need
of
supplementary
legislation
thorough
military
education
must
be
provided
and
in
addition
to
the
regulars
the
advantages
of
this
education
should
be
given
to
the
officers
of
the
national
guard
and
others
in
civil
life
who
desire
intelligently
to
fit
themselves
for
possible
military
duty
the
officers
should
be
given
the
chance
to
perfect
themselves
by
study
in
the
higher
branches
of
this
art
at
west
point
the
education
should
be
of
the
kind
most
apt
to
turn
out
men
who
are
good
in
actual
field
service
too
much
stress
should
not
be
laid
on
mathematics
nor
should
proficiency
therein
be
held
to
establish
the
right
of
entry
to
a
corps
delite
the
typical
american
officer
of
the
best
kind
need
not
be
a
good
mathematician
but
he
must
be
able
to
master
h
imself
to
control
others
and
to
show
boldness
and
fertility
of
resource
in
every
emergency
action
should
be
taken
in
reference
to
the
militia
and
to
the
raising
of
volunteer
forces
our
militia
law
is
obsolete
and
worthless
the
organization
and
armament
of
the
national
guard
of
the
several
states
which
are
treated
as
militia
in
the
appropriations
by
the
congress
should
be
made
identical
with
those
provided
for
the
regular
forces
the
obligations
and
duties
of
the
guard
in
time
of
war
should
be
carefully
defined
and
a
system
established
by
law
under
which
the
method
of
procedure
of
raising
volunteer
forces
should
be
prescribed
in
advance
it
is
utterly
impossible
in
the
excitement
and
haste
of
impending
war
to
do
this
satisfactorily
if
the
arrangements
have
not
been
made
long
beforehand
provision
should
be
made
for
utilizing
in
the
first
volunteer
organizations
called
out
the
training
of
those
citizens
who
have
already
had
experience
under
arms
and
especially
for
the
selection
in
advance
of
the
officers
of
any
force
which
may
be
raised
for
careful
selection
of
the
kind
necessary
is
impossible
after
the
outbreak
of
war
that
the
army
is
not
at
all
a
mere
instrument
of
destruction
has
been
shown
during
the
last
three
years
in
the
philippines
cuba
and
puerto
rico
it
has
proved
itself
a
great
constructive
force
a
most
potent
implement
for
the
upbuilding
of
a
peaceful
civilization
no
other
citizens
deserve
so
well
of
the
republic
as
the
veterans
the
survivors
of
those
who
saved
the
union
they
did
the
one
deed
which
if
left
undone
would
have
meant
that
all
else
in
our
history
went
for
nothing
but
for
their
steadfast
prowess
in
the
greatest
crisis
of
our
history
all
our
annals
would
be
meaningless
and
our
great
experiment
in
popular
freedom
and
selfgovernment
a
gloomy
failure
moreover
they
not
only
left
us
a
united
nation
but
they
left
us
also
as
a
heritage
the
memory
of
the
mighty
deeds
by
which
the
nation
was
kept
united
we
are
now
indeed
one
nation
one
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
we
are
united
in
our
devotion
to
the
flag
which
is
the
symbol
of
national
greatness
and
unity
and
the
very
completeness
of
our
union
enables
us
all
in
every
part
of
the
country
to
glory
in
the
valor
shown
alike
by
the
sons
of
the
north
and
the
sons
of
the
south
in
the
times
that
tried
mens
souls
the
men
who
in
the
last
three
years
have
done
so
well
in
the
east
and
the
west
indies
and
on
the
mainland
of
asia
have
shown
that
this
remembrance
is
not
lost
in
any
serious
crisis
the
united
states
must
rely
for
the
great
mass
of
its
fighting
men
upon
the
volunteer
soldiery
who
do
not
make
a
permanent
profession
of
the
military
career
and
whenever
such
a
crisis
arises
the
deathless
memories
of
the
civil
war
will
give
to
americans
the
lift
of
lofty
purpose
which
comes
to
those
whose
fathers
have
stood
valiantly
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
the
merit
system
of
making
appointments
is
in
its
essence
as
democratic
and
american
as
the
common
school
system
itself
it
simply
means
that
in
clerical
and
other
positions
where
the
duties
are
entirely
nonpolitical
all
applicants
should
have
a
fair
field
and
no
favor
each
standing
on
his
merits
as
he
is
able
to
show
them
by
practical
test
written
competitive
examinations
offer
the
only
available
means
in
many
cases
for
applying
this
system
in
other
cases
as
where
laborers
are
employed
a
system
of
registration
undoubtedly
can
be
widely
extended
there
are
of
course
places
where
the
written
competitive
examination
cannot
be
applied
and
others
where
it
offers
by
no
means
an
ideal
solution
but
where
under
existing
political
conditions
it
is
though
an
imperfect
means
yet
the
best
present
means
of
getting
satisfactory
results
wherever
the
conditions
have
permitted
the
application
of
the
merit
system
in
its
fullest
and
widest
sense
the
gain
to
the
government
has
been
immense
the
navyyards
and
postal
service
illustrate
probably
better
than
any
other
branches
of
the
government
the
great
gain
in
economy
efficiency
and
honesty
due
to
the
enforcement
of
this
principle
i
recommend
the
passage
of
a
law
which
will
extend
the
classified
service
to
the
district
of
columbia
or
will
at
least
enable
the
president
thus
to
extend
it
in
my
judgment
all
laws
providing
for
the
temporary
employment
of
clerks
should
hereafter
contain
a
provision
that
they
be
selected
under
the
civil
service
law
it
is
important
to
have
this
system
obtain
at
home
but
it
is
even
more
important
to
have
it
applied
rigidly
in
our
insular
possessions
not
an
office
should
be
filled
in
the
philippines
or
puerto
rico
with
any
regard
to
the
mans
partisan
affiliations
or
services
with
any
regard
to
the
political
social
or
personal
influence
which
he
may
have
at
his
command
in
short
heed
should
be
paid
to
absolutely
nothing
save
the
mans
own
character
and
capacity
and
the
needs
of
the
service
the
administration
of
these
islands
should
be
as
wholly
free
from
the
suspicion
of
partisan
politics
as
the
administration
of
the
army
and
navy
all
that
we
ask
from
the
public
servant
in
the
philippines
or
puerto
rico
is
that
he
reflect
honor
on
his
country
by
the
way
in
which
he
makes
that
countrys
rule
a
benefit
to
the
peoples
who
have
come
under
it
this
is
all
that
we
should
ask
and
we
cannot
afford
to
be
content
with
less
the
merit
system
is
simply
one
method
of
securing
honest
and
efficient
administration
of
the
government
and
in
the
long
run
the
sole
justification
of
any
type
of
government
lies
in
its
proving
itself
both
honest
and
efficient
the
consular
service
is
now
organized
under
the
provisions
of
a
law
passed
in
which
is
entirely
inadequate
to
existing
conditions
the
interest
shown
by
so
many
commercial
bodies
throughout
the
country
in
the
reorganization
of
the
service
is
heartily
commended
to
your
attention
several
bills
providing
for
a
new
consular
service
have
in
recent
years
been
submitted
to
the
congress
they
are
based
upon
the
just
principle
that
appointments
to
the
service
should
be
made
only
after
a
practical
test
of
the
applicants
fitness
that
promotions
should
be
governed
by
trustworthiness
adaptability
and
zeal
in
the
performance
of
duty
and
that
the
tenure
of
office
should
be
unaffected
by
partisan
considerations
the
guardianship
and
fostering
of
our
rapidly
expanding
foreign
commerce
the
protection
of
american
citizens
resorting
to
foreign
countries
in
lawful
pursuit
of
their
affairs
and
the
maintenance
of
the
dignity
of
the
nation
abroad
combine
to
make
it
essential
that
our
consuls
should
be
men
of
character
knowledge
and
enterprise
it
is
true
that
the
service
is
now
in
the
main
efficient
but
a
standard
of
excellence
cannot
be
permanently
maintained
until
the
principles
set
forth
in
the
bills
heretofore
submitted
to
the
congress
on
this
subject
are
enacted
into
law
in
my
judgment
the
time
has
arrived
when
we
should
definitely
make
up
our
minds
to
recognize
the
indian
as
an
individual
and
not
as
a
member
of
a
tribe
the
general
allotment
act
is
a
mighty
pulverizing
engine
to
break
up
the
tribal
mass
it
acts
directly
upon
the
family
and
the
individual
under
its
provisions
some
sixty
thousand
indians
have
already
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
we
should
now
break
up
the
tribal
funds
doing
for
them
what
allotment
does
for
the
tribal
lands
that
is
they
should
be
divided
into
individual
holdings
there
will
be
a
transition
period
during
which
the
funds
will
in
many
cases
have
to
be
held
in
trust
this
is
the
case
also
with
the
lands
a
stop
should
be
put
upon
the
indiscriminate
permission
to
indians
to
lease
their
allotments
the
effort
should
be
steadily
to
make
the
indian
work
like
any
other
man
on
his
own
ground
the
marriage
laws
of
the
indians
should
be
made
the
same
as
those
of
the
whites
in
the
schools
the
education
should
be
elementary
and
largely
industrial
the
need
of
higher
education
among
the
indians
is
very
very
limited
on
the
reservations
care
should
be
taken
to
try
to
suit
the
teaching
to
the
needs
of
the
particular
indian
there
is
no
use
in
attempting
to
induce
agriculture
in
a
country
suited
only
for
cattle
raising
where
the
indian
should
be
made
a
stock
grower
the
ration
system
which
is
merely
the
corral
and
the
reservation
system
is
highly
detrimental
to
the
indians
it
promotes
beggary
perpetuates
pauperism
and
stifles
industry
it
is
an
effectual
barrier
to
progress
it
must
continue
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
as
long
as
tribes
are
herded
on
reservations
and
have
everything
in
common
the
indian
should
be
treated
as
an
individuallike
the
white
man
during
the
change
of
treatment
inevitable
hardships
will
occur
every
effort
should
be
made
to
minimize
these
hardships
but
we
should
not
because
of
them
hesitate
to
make
the
change
there
should
be
a
continuous
reduction
in
the
number
of
agencies
in
dealing
with
the
aboriginal
races
few
things
are
more
important
than
to
preserve
them
from
the
terrible
physical
and
moral
degradation
resulting
from
the
liquor
traffic
we
are
doing
all
we
can
to
save
our
own
indian
tribes
from
this
evil
wherever
by
international
agreement
this
same
end
can
be
attained
as
regards
races
where
we
do
not
possess
exclusive
control
every
effort
should
be
made
to
bring
it
about
i
bespeak
the
most
cordial
support
from
the
congress
and
the
people
for
the
st
louis
exposition
to
commemorate
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
louisiana
purchase
this
purchase
was
the
greatest
instance
of
expansion
in
our
history
it
definitely
decided
that
we
were
to
become
a
great
continental
republic
by
far
the
foremost
power
in
the
western
hemisphere
it
is
one
of
three
or
four
great
landmarks
in
our
historythe
great
turning
points
in
our
development
it
is
eminently
fitting
that
all
our
people
should
join
with
heartiest
good
will
in
commemorating
it
and
the
citizens
of
st
louis
of
missouri
of
all
the
adjacent
region
are
entitled
to
every
aid
in
making
the
celebration
a
noteworthy
event
in
our
annals
we
earnestly
hope
that
foreign
nations
will
appreciate
the
deep
interest
our
country
takes
in
this
exposition
and
our
view
of
its
importance
from
every

standpoint
and
that
they
will
participate
in
securing
its
success
the
national
government
should
be
represented
by
a
full
and
complete
set
of
exhibits
the
people
of
charleston
with
great
energy
and
civic
spirit
are
carrying
on
an
exposition
which
will
continue
throughout
most
of
the
present
session
of
the
congress
i
heartily
commend
this
exposition
to
the
good
will
of
the
people
it
deserves
all
the
encouragement
that
can
be
given
it
the
managers
of
the
charleston
exposition
have
requested
the
cabinet
officers
to
place
thereat
the
government
exhibits
which
have
been
at
buffalo
promising
to
pay
the
necessary
expenses
i
have
taken
the
responsibility
of
directing
that
this
be
done
for
i
feel
that
it
is
due
to
charleston
to
help
her
in
her
praiseworthy
effort
in
my
opinion
the
management
should
not
be
required
to
pay
all
these
expenses
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
congress
appropriate
at
once
the
small
sum
necessary
for
this
purpose
the
panamerican
exposition
at
buffalo
has
just
closed
both
from
the
industrial
and
the
artistic
standpoint
this
exposition
has
been
in
a
high
degree
creditable
and
useful
not
merely
to
buffalo
but
to
the
united
states
the
terrible
tragedy
of
the
presidents
assassination
interfered
materially
with
its
being
a
financial
success
the
exposition
was
peculiarly
in
harmony
with
the
trend
of
our
public
policy
because
it
represented
an
effort
to
bring
into
closer
touch
all
the
peoples
of
the
western
hemisphere
and
give
them
an
increasing
sense
of
unity
such
an
effort
was
a
genuine
service
to
the
entire
american
public
the
advancement
of
the
highest
interests
of
national
science
and
learning
and
the
custody
of
objects
of
art
and
of
the
valuable
results
of
scientific
expeditions
conducted
by
the
united
states
have
been
committed
to
the
smithsonian
institution
in
furtherance
of
its
declared
purposefor
the
increase
and
diffusion
of
knowledge
among
menthe
congress
has
from
time
to
time
given
it
other
important
functions
such
trusts
have
been
executed
by
the
institution
with
notable
fidelity
there
should
be
no
halt
in
the
work
of
the
institution
in
accordance
with
the
plans
which
its
secretary
has
presented
for
the
preservation
of
the
vanishing
races
of
great
north
american
animals
in
the
national
zoological
park
the
urgent
needs
of
the
national
museum
are
recommended
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
the
congress
perhaps
the
most
characteristic
educational
movement
of
the
past
fifty
years
is
that
which
has
created
the
modern
public
library
and
developed
it
into
broad
and
active
service
there
are
now
over
five
thousand
public
libraries
in
the
united
states
the
product
of
this
period
in
addition
to
accumulating
material
they
are
also
striving
by
organization
by
improvement
in
method
and
by
cooperation
to
give
greater
efficiency
to
the
material
they
hold
to
make
it
more
widely
useful
and
by
avoidance
of
unnecessary
duplication
in
process
to
reduce
the
cost
of
its
administration
in
these
efforts
they
naturally
look
for
assistance
to
the
federal
library
which
though
still
the
library
of
congress
and
so
entitled
is
the
one
national
library
of
the
united
states
already
the
largest
single
collection
of
books
on
the
western
hemisphere
and
certain
to
increase
more
rapidly
than
any
other
through
purchase
exchange
and
the
operation
of
the
copyright
law
this
library
has
a
unique
opportunity
to
render
to
the
libraries
of
this
countryto
american
scholarshipservice
of
the
highest
importance
it
is
housed
in
a
building
which
is
the
largest
and
most
magnificent
yet
erected
for
library
uses
resources
are
now
being
provided
which
will
develop
the
collection
properly
equip
it
with
the
apparatus
and
service
necessary
to
its
effective
use
render
its
bibliographic
work
widely
available
and
enable
it
to
become
not
merely
a
center
of
research
but
the
chief
factor
in
great
cooperative
efforts
for
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
and
the
advancement
of
learning
for
the
sake
of
good
administration
sound
economy
and
the
advancement
of
science
the
census
office
as
now
constituted
should
be
made
a
permanent
government
bureau
this
would
insure
better
cheaper
and
more
satisfactory
work
in
the
interest
not
only
of
our
business
but
of
statistic
economic
and
social
science
the
remarkable
growth
of
the
postal
service
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
its
revenues
have
doubled
and
its
expenditures
have
nearly
doubled
within
twelve
years
its
progressive
development
compels
constantly
increasing
outlay
but
in
this
period
of
business
energy
and
prosperity
its
receipts
grow
so
much
faster
than
its
expenses
that
the
annual
deficit
has
been
steadily
reduced
from
in
to
in
among
recent
postal
advances
the
success
of
rural
free
delivery
wherever
established
has
been
so
marked
and
actual
experience
has
made
its
benefits
so
plain
that
the
demand
for
its
extension
is
general
and
urgent
it
is
just
that
the
great
agricultural
population
should
share
in
the
improvement
of
the
service
the
number
of
rural
routes
now
in
operation
is
practically
all
established
within
three
years
and
there
are
applications
awaiting
action
it
is
expected
that
the
number
in
operation
at
the
close
of
the
current
fiscal
year
will
reach
the
mail
will
then
be
daily
carried
to
the
doors
of
of
our
people
who
have
heretofore
been
dependent
upon
distant
offices
and
onethird
of
all
that
portion
of
the
country
which
is
adapted
to
it
will
be
covered
by
this
kind
of
service
the
full
measure
of
postal
progress
which
might
be
realized
has
long
been
hampered
and
obstructed
by
the
heavy
burden
imposed
on
the
government
through
the
intrenched
and
wellunderstood
abuses
which
have
grown
up
in
connection
with
secondclass
mail
matter
the
extent
of
this
burden
appears
when
it
is
stated
that
while
the
secondclass
matter
makes
nearly
threefifths
of
the
weight
of
all
the
mail
it
paid
for
the
last
fiscal
year
only
of
the
aggregate
postal
revenue
of
if
the
pound
rate
of
postage
which
produces
the
large
loss
thus
entailed
and
which
was
fixed
by
the
congress
with
the
purpose
of
encouraging
the
dissemination
of
public
information
were
limited
to
the
legitimate
newspapers
and
periodicals
actually
contemplated
by
the
law
no
just
exception
could
be
taken
that
expense
would
be
the
recognized
and
accepted
cost
of
a
liberal
public
policy
deliberately
adopted
for
a
justifiable
end
but
much
of
the
matter
which
enjoys
the
privileged
rate
is
wholly
outside
of
the
intent
of
the
law
and
has
secured
admission
only
through
an
evasion
of
its
requirements
or
through
lax
construction
the
proportion
of
such
wrongly
included
matter
is
estimated
by
postal
experts
to
be
onehalf
of
the
whole
volume
of
secondclass
mail
if
it
be
only
onethird
or
onequarter
the
magnitude
of
the
burden
is
apparent
the
postoffice
department
has
now
undertaken
to
remove
the
abuses
so
far
as
is
possible
by
a
stricter
application
of
the
law
and
it
should
be
sustained
in
its
effort
owing
to
the
rapid
growth
of
our
power
and
our
interests
on
the
pacific
whatever
happens
in
china
must
be
of
the
keenest
national
concern
to
us
the
general
terms
of
the
settlement
of
the
questions
growing
out
of
the
antiforeign

will
and
leaving
no
effort
untried
to
work
out
the
great
policy
of
full
and
fair
intercourse
between
china
and
the
nations
on
a
footing
of
equal
rights
and
advantages
to
all
we
advocate
the
open
door
with
all
that
it
implies
not
merely
the
procurement
of
enlarged
commercial
opportunities
on
the
coasts
but
access
to
the
interior
by
the
waterways
with
which
china
has
been
so
extraordinarily
favored
only
by
bringing
the
people
of
china
into
peaceful
and
friendly
community
of
trade
with
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
can
the
work
now
auspiciously
begun
be
carried
to
fruition
in
the
attainment
of
this
purpose
we
necessarily
claim
parity
of
treatment
under
the
conventions
throughout
the
empire
for
our
trade
and
our
citizens
with
those
of
all
other
powers
we
view
with
lively
interest
and
keen
hopes
of
beneficial
results
the
proceedings
of
the
panamerican
congress
convoked
at
the
invitation
of
mexico
and
now
sitting
at
the
mexican
capital
the
delegates
of
the
united
states
are
under
the
most
liberal
instructions
to
cooperate
with
their
colleagues
in
all
matters
promising
advantage
to
the
great
family
of
american
commonwealths
as
well
in
their
relations
among
themselves
as
in
their
domestic
advancement
and
in
their
intercourse
with
the
world
at
large
my
predecessor
communicated
to
the
congress
the
fact
that
the
weil
and
la
abra
awards
against
mexico
have
been
adjudged
by
the
highest
courts
of
our
country
to
have
been
obtained
through
fraud
and
perjury
on
the
part
of
the
claimants
and
that
in
accordance
with
the
acts
of
the
congress
the
money
remaining
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
state
on
these
awards
has
been
returned
to
mexico
a
considerable
portion
of
the
money
received
from
mexico
on
these
awards
had
been
paid
by
this
government
to
the
claimants
before
the
decision
of
the
courts
was
rendered
my
judgment
is
that
the
congress
should
return
to
mexico
an
amount
equal
to
the
sums
thus
already
paid
to
the
claimants
the
death
of
queen
victoria
caused
the
people
of
the
united
states
deep
and
heartfelt
sorrow
to
which
the
government
gave
full
expression
when
president
mckinley
died
our
nation
in
turn
received
from
every
quarter
of
the
british
empire
expressions
of
grief
and
sympathy
no
less
sincere
the
death
of
the
empress
dowager
frederick
of
germany
also
aroused
the
genuine
sympathy
of
the
american
people
and
this
sympathy
was
cordially
reciprocated
by
germany
when
the
president
was
assassinated
indeed
from
every
quarter
of
the
civilized
world
we
received
at
the
time
of
the
presidents
death
assurances
of
such
grief
and
regard
as
to
touch
the
hearts
of
our
people
in
the
midst
of
our
affliction
we
reverently
thank
the
almighty
that
we
are
at
peace
with
the
nations
of
mankind
and
we
firmly
intend
that
our
policy
shall
be
such
as
to
continue
unbroken
these
international
relations
of
mutual
respect
and
good
will

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
at
the
outgoing
of
the
old
and
the
incoming
of
the
new
century
you
begin
the
last
session
of
the
fiftysixth
congress
with
evidences
on
every
hand
of
individual
and
national
prosperity
and
with
proof
of
the
growing
strength
and
increasing
power
for
good
of
republican
institutions
your
countrymen
will
join
with
you
in
felicitation
that
american
liberty
is
more
firmly
established
than
ever
before
and
that
love
for
it
and
the
determination
to
preserve
it
are
more
universal
than
at
any
former
period
of
our
history
the
republic
was
never
so
strong
because
never
so
strongly
entrenched
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
as
now
the
constitution
with
few
amendments
exists
as
it
left
the
hands
of
its
authors
the
additions
which
have
been
made
to
it
proclaim
larger
freedom
and
more
extended
citizenship
popular
government
has
demonstrated
in
its
one
hundred
and
twentyfour
years
of
trial
here
its
stability
and
security
and
its
efficiency
as
the
best
instrument
of
national
development
and
the
best
safeguard
to
human
rights
when
the
sixth
congress
assembled
in
november
the
population
of
the
united
states
was
it
is
now
then
we
had
sixteen
states
now
we
have
fortyfive
then
our
territory
consisted
of
square
miles
it
is
now
square
miles
education
religion
and
morality
have
kept
pace
with
our
advancement
in
other
directions
and
while
extending
its
power
the
government
has
adhered
to
its
foundation
principles
and
abated
none
of
them
in
dealing
with
our
new
peoples
and
possessions
a
nation
so
preserved
and
blessed
gives
reverent
thanks
to
god
and
invokes
his
guidance
and
the
continuance
of
his
care
and
favor
in
our
foreign
intercourse
the
dominant
question
has
been
the
treatment
of
the
chinese
problem
apart
from
this
our
relations
with
the
powers
have
been
happy
the
recent
troubles
in
china
spring
from
the
antiforeign
agitation
which
for
the
past
three
years
has
gained
strength
in
the
northern
provinces
their
origin
lies
deep
in
the
character
of
the
chinese
races
and
in
the
traditions
of
their
government
the
taiping
rebellion
and
the
opening
of
chinese
ports
to
foreign
trade
and
settlement
disturbed
alike
the
homogeneity
and
the
seclusion
of
china
meanwhile
foreign
activity
made
itself
felt
in
all
quarters
not
alone
on
the
coast
but
along
the
great
river
arteries
and
in
the
remoter
districts
carrying
new
ideas
and
introducing
new
associations
among
a
primitive
people
which
had
pursued
for
centuries
a
national
policy
of
isolation
the
telegraph
and
the
railway
spreading
over
their
land
the
steamers
plying
on
their
waterways
the
merchant
and
the
missionary
penetrating
year
by
year
farther
to
the
interior
became
to
the
chinese
mind
types
of
an
alien
invasion
changing
the
course
of
their
national
life
and
fraught
with
vague
forebodings
of
disaster
to
their
beliefs
and
their
selfcontrol
for
several
years
before
the
present
troubles
all
the
resources
of
foreign
diplomacy
backed
by
moral
demonstrations
of
the
physical
force
of
fleets
and
arms
have
been
needed
to
secure
due
respect
for
the
treaty
rights
of
foreigners
and
to
obtain
satisfaction
from
the
responsible
authorities
for
the
sporadic
outrages
upon
the
persons
and
property
of
unoffending
sojourners
which
from
time
to
time
occurred
at
widely
separated
points
in
the
northern
provinces
as
in
the
case
of
the
outbreaks
in
szechuen
and
shantung
posting
of
antiforeign
placards
became
a
daily
occurrence
which
the
repeated
reprobation
of
the
imperial
power
failed
to
check
or
punish
these
inflammatory
appeals
to
the
ignorance
and
superstition
of
the
masses
mendacious
and
absurd
in
their
accusations
and
deeply
hostile
in
their
spirit
could
not
but
work
cumulative
harm
they
aimed
at
no
particular
class
of
foreigners
they
were
impartial
in
attacking
everything
foreign
an
outbreak
in
shantung
in
which
german
missionaries
were
slain
was
the
too
natural
result
of
these
malevolent
teachings
the
posting
of
seditious
placards
exhorting
to
the
utter
destruction
of
foreigners
and
of
every
foreign
thing
continued
unrebuked
hostile
demonstrations
toward
the
stranger
gained
strength
by
organization
the
sect
commonly
styled
the
boxers
developed
greatly
in
the
provinces
north
of
the
yangtse
and
with
the
collusion
of
many
notable
officials
including
some
in
the
immediate
councils
of
the
throne
itself
became
alarmingly
aggressive
no
foreigners
life
outside
of
the
protected
treaty
ports
was
safe
no
foreign
interest
was
secure
from
spoliation
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
powers
in
peking
strove
in
vain
to
check
this
movement
protest
was
followed
by
demand
and
demand
by
renewed
protest
to
be
met
with
perfunctory
edicts
from
the
palace
and
evasive
and
futile
assurances
from
the
tsungli
yamen
the
circle
of
the
boxer
influence
narrowed
about
peking
and
while
nominally
stigmatized
as
seditious
it
was
felt
that
its
spirit
pervaded
the
capital
itself
that
the
imperial
forces
were
imbued
with
its
doctrines
and
that
the
immediate
counselors
of
the
empress
dowager
were
in
full
sympathy
with
the
antiforeign
movement
the
increasing
gravity
of
the
conditions
in
china
and
the
imminence
of
peril
to
our
own
diversified
interests
in
the
empire
as
well
as
to
those
of
all
the
other
treaty
governments
were
soon
appreciated
by
this
government
causing
it
profound
solicitude
the
united
states
from
the
earliest
days
of
foreign
intercourse
with
china
had
followed
a
policy
of
peace
omitting
no
occasions
to
testify
good
will
to
further
the
extension
of
lawful
trade
to
respect
the
sovereignty
of
its
government
and
to
insure
by
all
legitimate
and
kindly
but
earnest
means
the
fullest
measure
of
protection
for
the
lives
and
property
of
our
lawabiding
citizens
and
for
the
exercise
of
their
beneficent
callings
among
the
chinese
people
mindful
of
this
it
was
felt
to
be
appropriate
that
our
purposes
should
be
pronounced
in
favor
of
such
course
as
would
hasten
united
action
of
the
powers
at
peking
to
promote
the
administrative
reforms
so
greatly
needed
for
strengthening
the
imperial
government
and
maintaining
the
integrity
of
china
in
which
we
believed
the
whole
western
world
to
be
alike
concerned
to
these
ends
i
caused
to
be
addressed
to
the
several
powers
occupying
territory
and
maintaining
spheres
of
influence
in
china
the
circular
proposals
of
inviting
from
them
declarations
of
their
intentions
and
views
as
to
the
desirability
of
the
adoption
of
measures
insuring
the
benefits
of
equality
of
treatment
of
all
foreign
trade
throughout
china
with
gratifying
unanimity
the
responses
coincided
in
this
common
policy
enabling
me
to
see
in
the
successful
termination
of
these
negotiations
proof
of
the
friendly
spirit
which
animates
the
various
powers
interested
in
the
untrammeled
development
of
commerce
and
industry
in
the
chinese
empire
as
a
source
of
vast
benefit
to
the
whole
commercial
world
in
this
conclusion
which
i
had
the
gratification
to
announce
as
a
completed
engagement
to
the
interested
powers
on
march
i
hopefully
discerned
a
potential
factor
for
the
abatement
of
the
distrust
of
foreign
purposes
which
for
a
year
past
had
appeared
to
inspire
the
policy
of
the
imperial
government
and
for
the
effective
exertion
by
it
of
power
and
authority
to
quell
the
critical
antiforeign
movement
in
the
northern
provinces
most
immediately
influenced
by
the
manchu
sentiment
seeking
to
testify
confidence
in
the
willingness
and
ability
of
the
imperial
administration
to
redress
the
wrongs
and
prevent
the
evils
we
suffered
and
feared
the
marine
guard
which
had
been
sent
to
peking
in
the
autumn
of
for
the
protection
of
the
legation
was
withdrawn
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
and
all
pending
questions
were
remitted
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
to
the
ordinary
resorts
of
diplomatic
intercourse
the
chinese
government
proved
however
unable
to
check
the
rising
strength
of
the
boxers
and
appeared
to
be
a
prey
to
internal
dissensions
in
the
unequal
contest
the
antiforeign
influences
soon
gained
the
ascendancy
under
the
leadership
of
prince
tuan
organized
armies
of
boxers
with
which
the
imperial
forces
affiliated
held
the
country
between
peking
and
the
coast
penetrated
into
manchuria
up
to
the
russian
borders
and
through
their
emissaries
threatened
a
like
rising
throughout
northern
china
attacks
upon
foreigners
destruction
of
their
property
and
slaughter
of
native
converts
were
reported
from
all
sides
the
tsungli
yamen
already
permeated
with
hostile
sympathies
could
make
no
effective
response
to
the
appeals
of
the
legations
at
this
critical
juncture
in
the
early
spring
of
this
year
a
proposal
was
made
by
the
other
powers
that
a
combined
fleet
should
be
assembled
in
chinese
waters
as
a
moral
demonstration
under
cover
of
which
to
exact
of
the
chinese
government
respect
for
foreign
treaty
rights
and
the
suppression
of
the
boxers
the
united
states
while
not
participating
in
the
joint
demonstration
promptly
sent
from
the
philippines
all
ships
that
could
be
spared
for
service
on
the
chinese
coast
a
small
force
of
marines
was
landed
at
taku
and
sent
to
peking
for
the
protection
of
the
american
legation
other
powers
took
similar
action
until
some
four
hundred
men
were
assembled
in
the
capital
as
legation
guards
still
the
peril
increased
the
legations
reported
the
development
of
the
seditious
movement
in
peking
and
the
need
of
increased
provision
for
defense
against
it
while
preparations
were
in
progress
for
a
larger
expedition
to
strengthen
the
legation
guards
and
keep
the
railway
open
an
attempt
of
the
foreign
ships
to
make
a
landing
at
taku
was
met
by
a
fire
from
the
chinese
forts
the
forts
were
thereupon
shelled
by
the
foreign
vessels
the
american
admiral
taking
no
part
in
the
attack
on
the
ground
that
we
were
not
at
war
with
china
and
that
a
hostile
demonstration
might
consolidate
the
antiforeign
elements
and
strengthen
the
boxers
to
oppose
the
relieving
column
two
days
later
the
taku
forts
were
captured
after
a
sanguinary
conflict
severance
of
communication
with
peking
followed
and
a
combined
force
of
additional
guards
which
was

advancing
to
peking
by
the
peiho
was
checked
at
langfang
the
isolation
of
the
legations
was
complete
the
siege
and
the
relief
of
the
legations
has
passed
into
undying
history
in
all
the
stirring
chapter
which
records
the
heroism
of
the
devoted
band
clinging
to
hope
in
the
face
of
despair
and
the
undaunted
spirit
that
led
their
relievers
through
battle
and
suffering
to
the
goal
it
is
a
memory
of
which
my
countrymen
may
be
justly
proud
that
the
honor
of
our
flag
was
maintained
alike
in
the
siege
and
the
rescue
and
that
stout
american
hearts
have
again
set
high
in
fervent
emulation
with
true
men
of
other
race
and
language
the
indomitable
courage
that
ever
strives
for
the
cause
of
right
and
justice
by
june
the
legations
were
cut
off
an

note
from
the
yamen

each
minister
to
leave
peking
under
a
promised
escort
within
twentyfour
hours
to
gain
time
they
replied

four
hundred

there
was
scarcely
an

during
which
there
was
not

from

was
placed
around

thousands
of

five
quarts
of

in
an
hour
in

were
made
to
burn

by
setting
neighboring
houses
on
fire

the
flames
were
successfully
fought
off
although
the
austrian
belgian

to
the
last
and
proved
an
invaluable
acquisition
because
commanding
the

gate
through
which
the
relief
column
entered
during
the
siege
the
defenders
lost
killed
wounded
and
by
disease
the
last
all
children
on
july
the
besieged
had
their
first
communication
with
the
tsungli
yamen
from
whom
a
message
came
inviting
to
a
conference
which
was
declined
correspondence
however
ensued
and
a
sort
of
armistice
was
agreed
upon
which
stopped
the
bombardment
and
lessened
the
rifle
fire
for
a
time
even
then
no
protection
whatever
was
afforded
nor
any
aid
given
save
to
send
to
the
legations
a
small
supply
of
fruit
and
three
sacks
of
flour
indeed
the
only
communication
had
with
the
chinese
government
related
to
the
occasional
delivery
or
dispatch
of
a
telegram
or
to
the
demands
of
the
tsungli
yamen
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
legations
to
the
coast
under
escort
not
only
are
the
protestations
of
the
chinese
government
that
it
protected
and
succored
the
legations
positively
contradicted
but
irresistible
proof
accumulates
that
the
attacks
upon
them
were
made
by
imperial
troops
regularly
uniformed
armed
and
officered
belonging
to
the
command
of
jung
lu
the
imperial
commander
in
chief
decrees
encouraging
the
boxers
organizing
them
tinder
prominent
imperial
officers
provisioning
them
and
even
granting
them
large
sums
in
the
name
of
the
empress
dowager
are
known
to
exist
members
of
the
tsungli
yamen
who
counseled
protection
of
the
foreigners
were
beheaded
even
in
the
distant
provinces
men
suspected
of
foreign
sympathy
were
put
to
death
prominent
among
these
being
chang
yenhoon
formerly
chinese
minister
in
washington
with
the
negotiation
of
the
partial
armistice
of
july
a
proceeding
which
was
doubtless
promoted
by
the
representations
of
the
chinese
envoy
in
washington
the
way
was
opened
for
the
conveyance
to
mr
conger
of
a
test
message
sent
by
the
secretary
of
state
through
the
kind
offices
of
minister
wu
tingfang
mr
congers
reply
dispatched
from
peking
on
july
through
the
same
channel
afforded
to
the
outside
world
the
first
tidings
that
the
inmates
of
the
legations
were
still
alive
and
hoping
for
succor
this
news
stimulated
the
preparations
for
a
joint
relief
expedition
in
numbers
sufficient
to
overcome
the
resistance
which
for
a
month
had
been
organizing
between
taku
and
the
capital
reinforcements
sent
by
all
the
cooperating
governments
were
constantly
arriving
the
united
states
contingent
hastily
assembled
from
the
philippines
or
dispatched
from
this
country
amounted
to
some
men
under
the
able
command
first
of
the
lamented
colonel
liscurn
and
afterwards
of
general
chaffee
toward
the
end
of
july
the
movement
began
a
severe
conflict
followed
at
tientsin
in
which
colonel
liscurn
was
killed
the
city
was
stormed
and
partly
destroyed
its
capture
afforded
the
base
of
operations
from
which
to
make
the
final
advance
which
began
in
the
first
days
of
august
the
expedition
being
made
up
of
japanese
russian
british
and
american
troops
at
the
outset
another
battle
was
fought
and
won
at
yangtsun
thereafter
the
disheartened
chinese
troops
offered
little
show
of
resistance
a
few
days
later
the
important
position
of
hosiwoo
was
taken
a
rapid
march
brought
the
united
forces
to
the
populous
city
of
tung
chow
which
capitulated
without
a
contest
on
august
the
capital
was
reached
after
a
brief
conflict
beneath
the
walls
the
relief
column
entered
and
the
legations
were
saved
the
united
states
soldiers
sailors
and
marines
officers
and
men
alike
in
those
distant
climes
and
unusual
surroundings
showed
the
same
valor
discipline
and
good
conduct
and
gave
proof
of
the
same
high
degree
of
intelligence
and
efficiency
which
have
distinguished
them
in
every
emergency
the
imperial
family
and
the
government
had
fled
a
few
days
before
the
city
was
without
visible
control
the
remaining
imperial
soldiery
had
made
on
the
night
of
the
th
a
last
attempt
to
exterminate
the
besieged
which
was
gallantly
repelled
it
fell
to
the
occupying
forces
to
restore
order
and
organize
a
provisional
administration
happily
the
acute
disturbances
were
confined
to
the
northern
provinces
it
is
a
relief
to
recall
and
a
pleasure
to
record
the
loyal
conduct
of
the
viceroys
and
local
authorities
of
the
southern
and
eastern
provinces
their
efforts
were
continuously
directed
to
the
pacific
control
of
the
vast
populations
under
their
rule
and
to
the
scrupulous
observance
of
foreign
treaty
rights
at
critical
moments
they
did
not
hesitate
to
memorialize
the
throne
urging
the
protection
of
the
legations
the
restoration
of
communication
and
the
assertion
of
the
imperial
authority
against
the
subversive
elements
they
maintained
excellent
relations
with
the
official
representatives
of
foreign
powers
to
their
kindly
disposition
is
largely
due
the
success
of
the
consuls
in
removing
many
of
the
missionaries
from
the
interior
to
places
of
safety
in
this
relation
the
action
of
the
consuls
should
be
highly
commended
in
shantung
and
eastern
chili
the
task
was
difficult
but
thanks
to
their
energy
and
the
cooperation
of
american
and
foreign
naval
commanders
hundreds
of
foreigners
including
those
of
other
nationalities
than
ours
were
rescued
from
imminent
peril
the
policy
of
the
united
states
through
all
this
trying
period
was
clearly
announced
and
scrupulously
carried
out
a
circular
note
to
the
powers
dated
july
proclaimed
our
attitude
treating
the
condition
in
the
north
as
one
of
virtual
anarchy
in
which
the
great
provinces
of
the
south
and
southeast
had
no
share
we
regarded
the
local
authorities
in
the
latter
quarters
as
representing
the
chinese
people
with
whom
we
sought
to
remain
in
peace
and
friendship
our
declared
aims
involved
no
war
against
the
chinese
nation
we
adhered
to
the
legitimate
office
of
rescuing
the
imperiled
legation
obtaining
redress
for
wrongs
already
suffered
securing
wherever
possible
the
safety
of
american
life
and
property
in
china
and
preventing
a
spread
of
the
disorders
or
their
recurrence
as
was
then
said
the
policy
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
to
seek
a
solution
which
may
bring
about
permanent
safety
and
peace
to
china
preserve
chinese
territorial
and
administrative
entity
protect
all
rights
guaranteed
to
friendly
powers
by
treaty
and
international
law
and
safeguard
for
the
world
the
principle
of
equal
and
impartial
trade
with
all
parts
of
the
chinese
empire
faithful
to
those
professions
which
as
it
proved
reflected
the
views
and
purposes
of
the
other
cooperating
governments
all
our
efforts
have
been
directed
toward
ending
the
anomalous
situation
in
china
by
negotiations
for
a
settlement
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
as
soon
as
the
sacred
duty
of
relieving
our
legat
ion
and
its
dependents
was
accomplished
we
withdrew
from
active
hostilities
leaving
our
legation
under
an
adequate
guard
in
peking
as
a
channel
of
negotiation
and
settlementa
course
adopted
by
others
of
the
interested
powers
overtures
of
the
empowered
representatives
of
the
chinese
emperor
have
been
considerately
entertained
the
russian
proposition
looking
to
the
restoration
of
the
imperial
power
in
peking
has
been
accepted
as
in
full
consonance
with
our
own
desires
for
we
have
held
and
hold
that
effective
reparation
for
wrongs
suffered
and
an
enduring
settlement
that
will
make
their
recurrence
impossible
can
best
be
brought
about
under
an
authority
which
the
chinese
nation
reverences
and
obeys
while
so
doing
we
forego
no
jot
of
our
undoubted
right
to
exact
exemplary
and
deterrent
punishment
of
the
responsible
authors
and
abettors
of
the
criminal
acts
whereby
we
and
other
nations
have
suffered
grievous
injury
for
the
real
culprits
the
evil
counselors
who
have
misled
the
imperial
judgment
and
diverted
the
sovereign
authority
to
their
own
guilty
ends
full
expiation
becomes
imperative
within
the
rational
limits
of
retributive
justice
regarding
this
as
the
initial
condition
of
an
acceptable
settlement
between
china
and
the
powers
i
said
in
my
message
of
october
to
the
chinese
emperor
i
trust
that
negotiations
may
begin
so
soon
as
we
and
the
other
offended
governments
shall
be
effectively
satisfied
of
your
majestys
ability
and
power
to
treat
with
just
sternness
the
principal
offenders
who
are
doubly
culpable
not
alone
toward
the
foreigners
but
toward
your
majesty
under
whose
rule
the
purpose
of
china
to
dwell
in
concord
with
the
world
had
hitherto
found
expression
in
the
welcome
and
protection
assured
to
strangers
taking
as
a
point
of
departure
the
imperial
edict
appointing
earl
li
hung
chang
and
prince
ching
plenipotentiaries
to
arrange
a
settlement
and
the
edict
of
september
whereby
certain
high
officials
were
designated
for
punishment
this
government
has
moved
in
concert
with
the
other
powers
toward
the
opening
of
negotiations
which
mr
conger
assisted
by
mr
rockhill
has
been
authorized
to
conduct
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
general
bases
of
negotiation
formulated
by
the
government
of
the
french
republic
have
been
accepted
with
certain
reservations
as
to
details
made
necessary
by
our
own
circumstances
but
like
similar
reservations
by
other
powers
open
to
discussion
in
the
progress
of
the
negotiations
the
disposition
of
the
emperors
government
to
admit
liability
for
wrongs
done
to
foreign
governments
and
their
nationals
and
to
act
upon
such
additional
designation
of
the
guilty
persons
as
the
foreign
ministers
at
peking
may
be
in
a
position
to
make
gives
hope
of
a
complete
settlement
of
all
questions
involved
assuring
foreign
rights
of
residence
and
intercourse
on
terms
of
equality
for
all
the
world
i
regard
as
one
of
the
essential
factors
of
a
durable
adjustment
the
securement
of
adequate
guarantees
for
liberty
of
faith
since
insecurity
of
those
natives
who
may
embrace
alien
creeds
is
a
scarcely
less
effectual
assault
upon
the
rights
of
foreign
worship
and
teaching
than
would
be
the
direct
invasion
thereof
the
matter
of
indemnity
for
our
wronged
citizens
is
a
question
of
grave
concern
measured
in
money
alone
a
sufficient
reparation
may
prove
to
be
beyond
the
ability
of
china
to
meet
all
the
powers
concur
in
emphatic
disclaimers
of
any
purpose
of
aggrandizement
through
the
dismemberment
of
the
empire
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
due
compensation
may
be
made
in
part
by
increased
guarantees
of
security
for
foreign
rights
and
immunities
and
most
important
of
all
by
the
opening
of
china
to
the
equal
commerce
of
all
the
world
these
views
have
been
and
will
be
earnestly
advocated
by
our
representatives
the
government
of
russia
has
put
forward
a
suggestion
that
in
the
event
of
protracted
divergence
of
views
in
regard
to
indemnities
the
matter
may
be
relegated
to
the
court
of
arbitration
at
the
hague
i
favorably
incline
to
this
believing
that
high
tribunal
could
not
fail
to
reach
a
solution
no
less
conducive
to
the
stability
and
enlarged
prosperity
of
china
itself
than
immediately
beneficial
to
the
powers
ratifications
of
a
treaty
of
extradition
with
the
argentine
republic
were
exchanged
on
june
last
while
the
austrohungarian
government
has
in
the
many
cases
that
have
been
reported
of
the
arrest
of
our
naturalized
citizens
for
alleged
evasion
of
military
service
faithfully
observed
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
and
released
such
persons
from
military
obligations
it
has
in
some
instances
expelled
those
whose
presence
in
the
community
of
their
origin
was
asserted
to
have
a
pernicious
influence
representations
have
been
made
against
this
course
whenever
its
adoption
has
appeared
unduly
onerous
we
have
been
urgently
solicited
by
belgium
to
ratify
the
international
convention
of
june
amendatory
of
the
previous
convention
of
in
respect
to
the
regulation
of
the
liquor
trade
in
africa
compliance
was
necessarily
withheld
in
the
absence
of
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
thereto
the
principle
involved
has
the
cordial
sympathy
of
this
government
which
in
the
reversionary
negotiations
advocated
more
drastic
measures
and
i
would
gladly
see
its
extension
by
international
agreement
to
the
restriction
of
the
liquor
traffic
with
all
uncivilized
peoples
especially
in
the
western
pacific
a
conference
will
be
held
at
brussels
december
under
the
convention
for
the
protection
of
industrial
property
concluded
at
paris
march
to
which
delegates
from
this
country
have
been
appointed
any
lessening
of
the
difficulties
that
our
inventors
encounter
in
obtaining
patents
abroad
for
their
inventions
and
that
our
farmers
manufacturers
and
merchants
may
have
in
the
protection
of
their
trademarks
is
worthy
of
careful
consideration
and
your
attention
will
be
called
to
the
results
of
the
conference
at
the
proper
time
in
the
interest
of
expanding
trade
between
this
country
and
south
america
efforts
have
been
made
during
the
past
year
to
conclude
conventions
with
the
southern
republics
for
the
enlargement
of
postal
facilities
two
such
agreements
signed
with
bolivia
on
april
of
which
that
establishing
the
moneyorder
system
is
undergoing
certain
changes
suggested
by
the
postoffice
department
have
not
yet
been
ratified
by
this
government
a
treaty
of
extradition
with
that
country
signed
on
the
same
day
is
before
the
senate
a
boundary
dispute
between
brazil
and
bolivia
over
the
territory
of
acre
is
in
a
fair
way
of
friendly
adjustment
a
protocol
signed
in
december
having
agreed
on
a
definite
frontier
and
provided
for
its
demarcation
by
a
joint
commission
conditions
in
brazil
have
weighed
heavily
on
our
export
trade
to
that
country
in
marked
contrast
to
the
favorable
conditions
upon
which
brazilian
products
are
admitted
into
our
markets
urgent
representations
have
been
made
to
that
government
on
the
subject
and
some
amelioration
has
been
effected
we
rely
upon
the
reciprocal
justice
and
good
will
of
that
government
to
assure
to
us
a
further
improvement
in
our
commercial
relations
the
convention
signed
may
for
the
final
settlement
of
claims
left
in
abeyance
upon
the
dissolution
of
the
commission
of
was
at
length
ratified
by
the
chilean
congress
and
the
supplemental
commission
has
been
organized
it
remains
for
the
congress
to
appropriate
for
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
commission
the
insurrectionary
movement
which
disturbed
colombia
in
the
latter
part
of
has
been
practically
suppressed
although
guerrillas
still
operate
in
some
departments
the
executive
power
of
that
republic
changed
hands
in
august
last
by
the
act
of
vicepresident
marroquin
in
assuming
the
reins
of
government
during
the
absence
of
president
san
clemente
from
the
capital
the
change
met
with
no
serious
opposition
and
following
the
precedents
in
such
cases
the
united
states
minister
entered
into
relations
with
the
new
defacto
government
on
september
it
is
gratifying
to
announce
that
the
residual
questions
between
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
growing
out
of
the
award
of
president
cleveland
in
have
been
adjusted
through
the
choice
of
an
american
engineer
general
e
p
alexander
as
umpire
to
run
the
disputed
line
his
task
has
been
accomplished
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
contestants
a
revolution
in
the
dominican
republic
toward
the
close
of
last
year
resulted
in
the
installation
of
president
jimenez
whose
government
was
formally
recognized
in
january
since
then
final
payment
has
been
made
of
the
american
claim
in
regard
to
the
ozama
bridge
the
year
of
the
exposition
has
been
fruitful
in
occasions
for
displaying
the
good
will
that
exists
between
this
country
and
france
this
great
competition
brought
together
from
every
nation
the
best
in
natural
productions
industry
science
and
the
arts
submitted
in
generous
rivalry
to
a
judgment
made
all
the
more
searching
because
of
that
rivalry
the
extraordinary
increase
of
exportations
from
this
country
during
the
past
three
years
and
the
activity
with
which
our
inventions
and
wares
had
invaded
new
markets
caused
much
interest
to
center
upon
the
american
exhibit
and
every
encouragement
was
offered
in
the
way
of
space
and
facilities
to
permit
of
its
being
comprehensive
as
a
whole
and
complete
in
every
part
it
was
however
not
an
easy
task
to
assemble
exhibits
that
could
fitly
illustrate
our
diversified
resources
and
manufactures
singularly
enough
our
national
prosperity
lessened
the
incentive
to
exhibit
the
dealer
in
raw
materials
knew
that
the
user
must
come
to
him
the
great
factories
were
contented
with
the
phenomenal
demand
for
their
output
not
alone
at
home
but
also
abroad
where
merit
had
already
won
a
profitable
trade
appeals
had
to
be
made
to
the
patriotism
of
exhibitors
to
induce
them
to
incur
outlays
promising
no
immediate
return
this
was
especially
the
case
where
it
became
needful
to
complete
an
industrial
sequence
or
illustrate
a
class
of
processes
one
manufacturer
after
another
had
to
be
visited
and
importuned
and
at
times
after
a
promise
to
exhibit
in
a
partic
ular
section
had
been
obtained
it
would
be
withdrawn
owing
to
pressure
of
trade
orders
and
a
new
quest
would
have
to
be
made
the
installation
of
exhibits
too
encountered
many
obstacles
and
involved
unexpected
cost
the
exposition
was
far
from
ready
at
the
date
fixed
for
its
opening
the
french
transportation
lines
were
congested
with
offered
freight
belated
goods
had
to
be
hastily
installed
in
unfinished
quarters
with
whatever
labor
could
be
obtained
in
the
prevailing
confusion
nor
was
the
task
of
the
commission
lightened
by
the
fact
that
owing
to
the
scheme
of
classification
adopted
it
was
impossible
to
have
the
entire
exhibit
of
any
one
country
in
the
same
building
or
more
than
one
group
of
exhibits
in
the
same
part
of
any
building
our
installations
were
scattered
on
both
sides
of
the
seine
and
in
widely
remote
suburbs
of
paris
so
that
additional
assistants
were
needed
for
the
work
of
supervision
and
arrangement
despite
all
these
drawbacks
the
contribution
of
the
united
states
was
not
only
the
largest
foreign
display
but
was
among
the
earliest
in
place
and
the
most
orderly
in
arrangement
our
exhibits
were
shown
in
one
hundred
and
one
out
of
one
hundred
and
twentyone
classes
and
more
completely
covered
the
entire
classification
than
those
of
any
other
nation
in
total
number
they
ranked
next
after
those
of
france
and
the
attractive
form
in
which
they
were
presented
secured
general
attention
a
criterion
of
the
extent
and
success
of
our
participation
and
of
the
thoroughness
with
which
our
exhibits
were
organized
is
seen
in
the
awards
granted
to
american
exhibitors
by
the
international
jury
namely
grand
prizes
gold
medals
silver
medals
bronze
medals
and
honorable
mentions
in
all
being
the
greatest
total
number
given
to
the
exhibit
of
any
exhibiting
nation
as
well
as
the
largest
number
in
each
grade
this
significant
recognition
of
merit
in
competition
with
the
chosen
exhibits
of
all
other
nations
and
at
the
hands
of
juries
almost
wholly
made
up
of
representatives
of
france
and
other
competing
countries
is
not
only
most
gratifying
but
is
especially
valuable
since
it
sets
us
to
the
front
in
international
questions
of
supply
and
demand
while
the
large
proportion
of
awards
in
the
classes
of
art
and
artistic
manufactures
afforded
unexpected
proof
of
the
stimulation
of
national
culture
by
the
prosperity
that
flows
from
natural
productiveness
joined
to
industrial
excellence
apart
from
the
exposition
several
occasions
for
showing
international
good
will
occurred
the
inauguration
in
paris
of
the
lafayette
monument
presented
by
the
school
children
of
the
united
states
and
the
designing
of
a
commemorative
coin
by
our
mint
and
the
presentation
of
the
first
piece
struck
to
the
president
of
the
republic
were
marked
by
appropriate
ceremonies
and
the
fourth
of
july
was
especially
observed
in
the
french
capital
good
will
prevails
in
our
relations
with
the
german
empire
an
amicable
adjustment
of
the
longpending
question
of
the
admission
of
our
lifeinsurance
companies
to
do
business
in
prussia
has
been
reached
one
of
the
principal
companies
has
already
been
readmitted
and
the
way
is
opened
for
the
others
to
share
the
privilege
the
settlement
of
the
samoan
problem
to
which
i
adverted
in
my
last
message
has
accomplished
good
results
peace
and
contentment
prevail
in
the
islands
especially
in
tutuila
where
a
convenient
administration
that
has
won
the
confidence
and
esteem
of
the
kindly
disposed
natives
has
been
organized
under

direction
of

been

while
it
may

there
is
still
great
uncertainty
as
to
whether
our
wellnigh
extinguished
german
trade
in
meat
products
can
revive

its
new
burdens
much
will
depend
upon
regulations
not
yet
promulgated
which
we
confidently
hope
will
be
free
from
the

which
attended

the

in
the
new
lines
of

telegraphic
communication
between
the

and

has
recently
been
completed
affording
a
gratifying
occasion

friendly
congratulations
with

the

in
southern

introduced
important
questions
a
condition
unusual
in
international
wars
was
presented
in
that
while
one
belligerent
had
control
of
the
seas
the
other
had
no
ports
shipping
or
direct
trade
but
was
only
accessible
through
the
territory
of
a
neutral
vexatious
questions
arose
through
great
britains
action
in
respect
to
neutral
cargoes
not
contraband
in
their
own
nature
shipped
to
portuguese
south
africa
on
the
score
of
probable
or
suspected
ultimate
destination
to

states
such
consignments
in
british
ships
by
which
alone
direct
trade
is
kept
up
between
our
ports
and

were
seized
in
application
of
a
municipal
law
prohibiting
british

from
trading
with
the
enemy
without
regard
to
any
contraband
character
of

goods
while
cargoes
shipped
to

bay
in
neutral
bottoms
were
arrested
on
the
ground
of
alleged
destination
to
enemys
country
appropriate
representations
on
our
part
resulted
in
the
british
government
agreeing
to
purchase
outright
all
such
goods
shown
to
be
the
actual
property
of
american
citizens
thus
closing
the
incident
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
immediately
interested
parties

unfortunately
without

completed
by
a
joint
survey
in

last
the
modus
vivendi
has
so
far
worked
without
friction
and
the
dominion
government
has
provided
rules
and
regulations
for
securing
to
our
citizens
the
benefit
of
the
reciprocal
stipulation
that
the
citizens
or
subjects
of
either
power
found
by
that
arrangement
within
the
temporary
jurisdiction
of
the
other
shall
suffer
no
diminution
of
the
rights
and
privileges
they
have
hitherto
enjoyed
but
however
necessary
such
an
expedient
may
have
been
to
tide
over
the
grave
emergencies
of
the
situation
it
is
at
best
but
an
unsatisfactory
makeshift
which
should
not
be
suffered
to
delay
the
speedy
and
complete
establishment
of
the
frontier
line
to
which
we
are
entitled
under
the
russoamerican
treaty
for
the
cession
of
alaska
in
this
relation
i
may
refer
again
to
the
need
of
definitely
marking
the
alaskan
boundary
where
it
follows
the
one
hundred
and
fortyfirst
meridian
a
convention
to
that
end
has
been
before
the
senate
for
some
two
years
but
as
no
action
has
been
taken
i
contemplate
negotiating
a
new
convention
for
a
joint
determination
of
the
meridian
by
telegraphic
observations
these
it
is
believed
will
give
more
accurate
and
unquestionable
results
than
the
sidereal
methods
heretofore
independently
followed
which
as
is
known
proved
discrepant
at
several
points
on
the
line
although
not
varying

any
place

of

various
american
claims
against

have
been
or
are
being

with
the
government
of
honduras
in
regard
to
the
indemnity
demanded
for
the
murder
of
frank
h
pears
in
honduras
that
government
has
paid
in
settlement
of
the
claim
of
the
heirs
the
assassination
of
king
humbert
called
forth
sincere
expressions
of
sorrow
from
this
government
and
people
and
occasion
was
fitly
taken
to
testify
to
the
italian
nation
the
high
regard
here
felt
for
the
memory
of
the
lamented
ruler
in
my
last
message
i
referred
at
considerable
length
to
the
lynching
of
five
italians
at
tallulah
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
the
federal
government
the
production
of
evidence
tending
to
inculpate
the
authors
of
this
grievous
offense
against
our
civilization
and
the
repeated
inquests
set
on
foot
by
the
authorities
of
the
state
of
louisiana
no
punishments
have
followed
successive
grand
juries
have
failed
to
indict
the
representations
of
the
italian
government
in
the
face
of
this
miscarriage
have
been
most
temperate
and
just
setting
the
principle
at
issue
high
above
all
consideration
of
merely
pecuniary
indemnification
such
as
this
government
made
in
the
three
previous
cases
italy
has
solemnly
invoked
the
pledges
of
existing
treaty
and
asked
that
the
justice
to
which
she
is
entitled
shall
be
meted
in
regard
to
her
unfortunate
countrymen
in
our
territory
with
the
same
full
measure
she
herself
would
give
to
any
american
were
his
reciprocal
treaty
rights
contemned
i
renew
the
urgent
recommendations
i
made
last
year
that
the
congress
appropriately
confer
upon
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
in
this
class
of
international
cases
where
the
ultimate
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
may
be
involved
and
i
invite
action
upon
the
bills
to
accomplish
this
which
were
introduced
in
the
sen
ate
and
house
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
to
remedy
the
statutory
omission
which
has
led
and
may
again
lead
to
such
untoward
results
i
have
pointed
out
the
necessity
and
the
precedent
for
legislation
of
this
character
its
enactment
is
a
simple
measure
of
previsory
justice
toward
the
nations
with
which
we
as
a
sovereign
equal
make
treaties
requiring
reciprocal
observance
while
the
italian
government
naturally
regards
such
action
as
the
primary
and
indeed
the
most
essential
element
in
the
disposal
of
the
tallulah
incident
i
advise
that
in
accordance
with
precedent
and
in
view
of
the
improbability
of
that
particular
case
being
reached
by
the
bill
now
pending
congress
make
gracious
provision
for
indemnity
to
the
italian
sufferers
in
the
same
form
and
proporti
on
as
heretofore
in
my
inaugural
address
i
referred
to
the
general
subject
of
lynching
in
these
words
lynching
must
not
be
tolerated
in
a
great
and
civilized
country
like
the
united
states
courts
not
mobs
must
execute
the
penalties
of
the
law
the
preservation
of
public
order
the
right
of
discussion
the
integrity
of
courts
and
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
must
continue
forever
the
rock
of
safety
upon
which
our
government
securely
rests
this
i
most
urgently
reiterate
and
again
invite
the
attention
of
my
countrymen
to
this
reproach
upon
our
civilization
the
closing
year
has
witnessed
a
decided
strengthening
of
japans
relations
to
other
states
the
development
of
her
independent
judicial
and
administrative
functions
under
the
treaties
which
took
effect
july
has
proceeded
without
international
friction
showing
the
competence
of
the
japanese
to
hold
a
foremost
place
among
modern
peoples
in
the
treatment
of
the
difficult
chinese
problems
japan
has
acted
in
harmonious
concert
with
the
other
powers
and
her
generous
cooperation
materially
aided
in
the
joint
relief
of
the
beleaguered
legations
in
peking
and
in
bringing
about
an
understanding
preliminary
to
a
settlement
of
the
issues
between
the
powers
and
china
japans
declarations
in
favor
of
the
integrity
of
the
chinese
empire
and
the
conservation
of

trade
therewith
have
been
frank
and
positive
as
a
factor
for
promoting
the
general
interests
of
peace
order
and
fair
commerce
in
the
far
east
the
influence
of
japan
can
hardly
be
overestimated
the
valuable
aid
and
kindly
courtesies
extended
by
the
japanese
government
and
naval
officers
to
the
battle
ship
oregon
are
gratefully
appreciated
complaint
was
made
last
summer
of
the
discriminatory
enforcement
of

of

district
of
nicaragua
early
in
the
insurgents
forcibly
collected
from
american
merchants
duties
upon
imports
on
the
restoration
of
order
the
nicaraguan
authorities
demanded
a
second
payment
of
such
duties
on
the
ground
that
they
were
due
to
the
titular
government
and
that
their
diversion
had
aided
the
revolt
this
position
was
not
accepted
by
us
after
prolonged
discussion
a
compromise
was
effected
under
which
the
amount
of
the
second
payments
was
deposited
with
the
british
consul
at
san
juan
del
norte
in
trust
until
the
two
governments
should
determine
whether
the
first
payments
had
been
made
under
compulsion
to
a
de
facto
authority
agreement
as
to
this
was
not
reached
and
the
point
was
waived
by
the
act
of
the
nicaraguan
government
in
requesting
the
british
consul
to
return
the
deposits
to
the
merchants
menacing
differences
between
several
of

central
american
states

been
accommodated
our
ministers
rendering
good
offices
toward
an
understanding
the
allimportant
matter
of
an
interoceanic
canal
has
assumed
a
new
phase
adhering
to
its
refusal
to
reopen
the
question
of
the
forfeiture
of
the
contract
of
the
maritime
canal
company
which
was
terminated
for
alleged
nonexecution
in
october
the
government
of
nicaragua
has
since
supplemented
that
action
by
declaring
the
so
styled
eyrecragin
option
void
for
nonpayment
of
the
stipulated
advance
protests
in
relation
to
these
acts
have
been
filed
in
the
state
department
and
are
under
consideration
deeming
itself
relieved
from
existing
engagements
the
nicaraguan
government
shows
a
disposition
to
deal
freely
with
the
canal
question
either
in
the
way
of
negotiations
with
the
united
states
or
by
taking
measures
to
promote
the
waterway
overtures
for
a
convention
to
effect
the
building
of
a
canal
under
the
auspices
of
the

are
under
consideration
in

the
views
of
the

upon

general
subject

of
the
report
of
the
commission
appointed
to
examine
the
comparative
merits
of
the
various
transisthmian
shipcanal
projects
may
be
awaited
i
commend
to
the
early
attention
of
the
senate
the
convention
with
great
britain
to
facilitate
the
construction
of
such
a
canal
and
to
remove
any
objection
which
might
arise
out
of
the
convention
commonly
called
the
claytonbulwer
treaty
the
longstanding
contention
with
portugal
growing
out
of
the
seizure
of
the
delagoa
bay
railway
has
been
at
last
determined
by
a
favorable
award
of
the
tribunal
of

at
berne
to
which
it
was
submitted
the
amount
of
the
award
which
was
deposited
in
london
awaiting
arrangements
by

with
peru
as
amended
by
the
senate
has
been
ratified
by
the
peruvian
congress
another
illustration
of
the
policy
of
this
government
to
refer
international
disputes
to
impartial
arbitration
is
seen
in
the
agreement
reached
with
russia
to
submit
the
claims
on
behalf
of
american
sealing

seized
in

a
distinguished
statesman
and
jurist
of
the
netherlands
thanks
are
due
to
the
imperial
russian
government
for
the
kindly
aid
rendered
by
its
authorities
in
eastern
siberia
to
american
missionaries
fleeing
from
manchuria
satisfactory
progress
has
been
made
toward
the
conclusion
of
a
general
treaty
of
friendship
and
intercourse
with
spain
in
replacement
of
the
old
treaty
which
passed
into
abeyance
by
reason
of
the
late
war
a
new
convention
of
extradition
is
approaching
completion
and
i
should
be
much
pleased
were
a
commercial
arrangement
to
follow
i
feel
that
we
should
not
suffer
to
pass
any
opportunity
to
reaffirm
the
cordial
ties
that
existed
between
us
and
spain
from
the
time
of
our
earliest
independence
and
to
enhance
the
mutual
benefits
of
that
commercial
intercourse
which
is
natural
between
the
two
countries
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
peace
the
line
bounding
the
ceded
philippine
group
in
the
southwest
failed
to
include
several
small
islands
lying
westward
of
the
sulus
which
have
always
been
recognized
as
under
spanish
control
the
occupation
of
sibutd
and
cagayan
sulu
by
our
naval
forces
elicited
a
claim
on
the
part
of
spain
the
essential
equity
of
which
could
not
be
gainsaid
in
order
to
cure
the
defect
of
the
treaty
by
removing
all
possible
ground
of
future
misunderstanding
respecting
the
interpretation
of
its
third
article
i
directed
the
negotiation
of
a
supplementary
treaty
which
will
be
forthwith
laid
before
the
senate
whereby
spain
quits
all
title
and
claim
of
title
to
the
islands
named
as
well
as
to
any
and
all
islands
belonging
to
the
philippine
archipelago
lying
outside
the
lines
described
in
said
third
article
and
agrees
that
all
such
islands
shall
be
comprehended
in
the
cession
of
the
archipelago
as
fully
as
if
they
had
been
expressly
included
within
those
lines
in
consideration
of
this
cession
the
united
states
is
to
pay
to
spain
the
sum
of
a
bill
is
now
pending
to
effect
the
recommendation
made
in
my
last
annual
message
that
appropriate
legislation
be
had
to
carry
into
execution
article
vii
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
spain
by
which
the
united
states
assumed
the
payment
of
certain
claims
for
indemnity
of
its
citizens
against
spain
i
ask
that
action
be
taken
to
fulfill
this
obligation
the
king
of
sweden
and
norway
has
accepted
the
joint
invitation
of
the
united
states
germany
and
great
britain
to
arbitrate
claims
growing
out
of
losses
sustained
in
the
samoan
islands
in
the
course
of
military
operations
made
necessary
by
the
disturbances
in
our
claims
upon
the
government
of
the
sultan
for
reparation
for
injuries
suffered
by
american
citizens
in
armenia
and
elsewhere
give
promise
of
early
and
satisfactory
settlement
his
majestys
good
disposition
in
this
regard
has
been
evinced
by
the
issuance
of
an
irade
for
rebuilding
the
american
college
at
harpoot
the
failure
of
action
by
the
senate
at
its
last
session
upon
the
commercial
conventions
then
submitted
for
its
consideration
and
approval
although
caused
by
the
great
pressure
of
other
legislative
busine
ss
has
caused
much
disappointment
to
the
agricultural
and
industrial
interests
of
the
country
which
hoped
to
profit
by
their
provisions
the
conventional
periods
for
their
ratification
having
expired
it
became
necessary
to
sign
additional
articles
extending
the
time
for
that
purpose
this
was
requested
on
our
part
and
the
other
governments
interested
have
concurred
with
the
exception
of
one
convention
in
respect
to
which
no
formal
reply
has
been
received
since
my
last
communication
to
the
congress
on
this
subject
special
commercial
agreements
under
the
third
section
of
the
tariff
act
have
been
proclaimed
with
portugal
with
italy
and
with
germany
commercial
conventions
tinder
the
general
limitations
of
the
fourth
section
of
the
same
act
have
been
concluded
with
nicaragua
with
ecuador
with
the
dominican
republic
with
great
britain
on
behalf
of
the
island
of
trinidad
and
with
denmark
on
behalf
of
the
island
of
st
croix
these
will
be
early
communicated
to
the
senate
negotiations
with
other
governments
are
in
progress
for
the
improvement
and
security
of
our
commercial
relations
the
policy
of
reciprocity
so
manifestly
rests
upon
the
principles
of
international
equity
and
has
been
so
repeatedly
approved
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
there
ought
to
be
no
hesitation
in
either
branch
of
the
congress
in
giving
to
it
full
effect
this
government
desires
to
preserve
the
most
just
and
amicable
commercial
relations
with
all
foreign
countries
unmoved
by
the
industrial
rivalries
necessarily
developed
in
the
expansion
of
international
trade
it
is
believed
that
the
foreign
governments
generally
entertain
the
same
purpose
although
in
some
instances
there
are
clamorous
demands
upon
them
for
legislation
specifically
hostile
to
american
interests
should
these
demands
prevail
i
shall
communicate
with
the
congress
with
the
view
of
advising
such
legislation
as
may
be
necessary
to
meet
the
emergency
the
exposition
of
the
resources
and
products
of
the
western
hemisphere
to
be
held
at
buffalo
next
year
promises
important
results
not
only
for
the
united
states
but
for
the
other
participating
countries
it
is
gratifying
that
the
latinamerican
states
have
evinced
the
liveliest
interest
and
the
fact
that
an
international
american
congress
will
be
held
in
the
city
of
mexico
while
the
exposition
is
in
progress
encourages
the
hope
of
a
larger
display
at
buffalo
than
might
otherwise
be
practicable
the
work
of
preparing
an
exhibit
of
our
national
resources
is
making
satisfactory
progress
under
the
direction
of
different
officials
of
the
federal
government
and
the
various
states
of
the
union
have
shown
a
disposition
toward
the
most
liberal
participation
in
the
enterprise
the
bureau
of
the
american
republics
continues
to
discharge
with
the
happiest
results
the
important
work
of
promoting
cordial
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
latinamerican
countries
all
of
which
are
now
active
members
of
the
international
union
the
bureau
has
been
instrumental
in
bringing
about
the
agreement
for
another
international
american
congress
which
is
to
meet
in
the
city
of
mexico
in
october
the
bureaus
future
for
another
term
of
ten
years
is
assured
by
the
international
compact
but
the
congress
will
doubtless
have
much
to
do
with
shaping
new
lines
of
work
and
a
general
policy
its
usefulness
to
the
interests
of
latinamerican
trade
is
widely
appreciated
and
shows
a
gratifying
development
the
practical
utility
of
the
consular
service
in
obtaining
a
wide
range
of
information
as
to
the
industries
and
commerce
of
other
countries
and
the
opportunities
thereby
afforded
for
introducing
the
sale
of
our
goods
have
kept
steadily
in
advance
of
the
notable
expansion
of
our
foreign
trade
and
abundant
evidence
has
been
furnished
both
at
home
and
abroad
of
the
fact
that
the
consular
reports
including
many
from
our
diplomatic
representatives
have
to
a
considerable
extent
pointed
out
ways
and
means
of
disposing
of
a
great
variety
of
manufactured
goods
which
otherwise
might
not
have
found
sale
abroad
testimony
of
foreign
observers
to
the
commercial
efficiency
of
the
consular
corps
seems
to
be
conclusive
and
our
own
manufacturers
and
exporters
highly
appreciate
the
value
of
the
services
rendered
not
only
in
the
printed
reports
but
also
in
the
individual
efforts
of
consular
officers
to
promote
american
trade
an
increasing
part
of
the
work
of
the
bureau
of
foreign
commerce
whose
primary
duty
it
is
to
compile
and
print
the
reports
is
to
answer
inquiries
from
trade
organizations
business
houses
etc
as
to
conditions
in
various
parts
of
the
world
and
notwithstanding
the
smallness
of
the
force
employed
the
work
has
been
so
systematized
that
responses
are
made
with
such
promptitude
and
accuracy
as
to
elicit
flattering
encomiums
the
experiment
of
printing
the
consular
reports
daily
for
immediate
use
by
trade
bodies
exporters
and
the
press
which
was
begun
in
january
continues
to
give
general
satisfaction
it
is
gratifying
to
be
able
to
state
that
the
surplus
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
were
for
the
six
preceding
years
we
had
only
deficits
the
aggregate
of
which
from
to
inclusive
amounted
to
the
receipts
for
the
year
from
all
sources
exclusive
of
postal
revenues
aggregated
and
expenditures
for
all
purposes
except
for
the
administration
of
the
postal
department
aggregated
the
receipts
from
customs
were
an
increase
over
the
preceding
year
of
the
receipts
from
internal
revenue
were
an
increase
of
over
the
receipts
from
miscellaneous
sources
were
as
against
for
the
previous
year
it
is
gratifying
also
to
note
that
during
the
year
a
considerable
reduction
is
shown
in
the
expenditures
of
the
government
the
war
department
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
were
a
reduction
of
over
those
of
in
the
navy
department
the
expenditures
were
for
the
year
as
against
for
the
preceding
year
a
decrease
of
in
the
expenditures
on
account
of
indians
there
was
a
decrease
in
over
of
and
in
the
civil
and
miscellaneous
expenses
for
there
was
a
reduction
of
because
of
the
excess
of
revenues
over
expenditures
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
enabled
to
apply
bonds
and
other
securities
to
the
sinking
fund
to
the
amount
of
the
details
of
the
sinking
fund
are
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
which
i
invite
attention
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
estimates
that
the
receipts
for
the
current
fiscal
year
will
aggregate
and
the
expenditures
leaving
an
excess
of
revenues
over
expenditures
of
the
present
condition
of
the
treasury
is
one
of
undoubted
strength
the
available
cash
balance
november
was
under
the
form
of
statement
prior
to
the
financial
law
of
march
last
there
would
have
been
included
in
the
statement
of
available
cash
gold
coin
and
bullion
held
for
the
redemption
of
united
states
notes
if
this
form
were
pursued
the
cash
balance
including
the
present
gold
reserve
of
would
be
such
balance
november
was
in
the
general
fund
which
is
wholly
separate
from
the
reserve
and
trust
funds
there
was
on
november
in
gold
coin
and
bullion
to
which
should
be
added
in
gold
certificates
subject
to
issue
against
which
there
is
held
in
the
division
of
redemption
gold
coin
and
bullion
making
a
total
holding
of
free
gold
amounting
to
it
will
be
the
duty
as
i
am
sure
it
will
be
the
disposition
of
the
congress
to
provide
whatever
further
legislation
is
needed
to
insure
the
continued
parity
under
all
conditions
between
our
two
forms
of
metallic
money
silver
and
gold
our
surplus
revenues
have
permitted
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
since
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
to
call
in
the
funded
loan
of
continued
at
per
cent
in
the
sum
of
to
and
including
november
of
these
bonds
have
been
paid
this
sum
together
with
the
amount
which
may
accrue
from
further
redemptions
under
the
call
will
be
applied
to
the
sinking
fund
the
law
of
march
provided
for
refunding
into
per
cent
thirtyyear
bonds
payable
principal
and
interest
in
gold
coin
of
the
present
standard
value
that
portion
of
the
public
debt
represented
by
the
per
cent
bonds
of
the
percents
of
and
the
percents
of
of
which
there
was
outstanding
at
the
date
of
said
law
the
holders
of
the
old
bonds
presented
them
for
exchange
between
march
and
november
to
the
amount
of
the
net
saving
to
the
government
on
these
transactions
aggregates
another
effect
of
the
operation
as
stated
by
the
secretary
is
to
reduce
the
charge
upon
the
treasury
for
the
payment
of
interest
from
the
dates
of
refunding
to
february
by
the
sum
of
more
than
seven
million
dollars
annually
from
february
to
july
the
annual
interest
charge
will
be
reduced
by
the
sum
of
more
than
five
millions
and
for
the
thirteen
months
ending
august
by
about
one
million
the
full
details
of
the
refunding
are
given
in
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
beneficial
effect
of
the
financial
act
of
so
far
as
it
relates
to
a
modification
of
the
national
banking
act
is
already
apparent
the
provision
for
the
incorporation
of
national
banks
with
a
capital
of
not
less
than
in
places
not
exceeding
three
thousand
inhabitants
has
resulted
in
the
extension
of
banking
facilities
to
many
small
communities
hitherto
unable
to
provide
themselves
with
banking
institutions
under
the
national
system
there
were
organized
from
the
enactment
of
the
law
up
to
and
including
november
national
banks
of
which
were
with
capital
less
than
and
with
capital
of
or
more
it
is
worthy
of
mention
that
the
greater
number
of
banks
being
organized
under
the
new
law
are
in
sections
where
the
need
of
banking
facilities
has
been
most
pronounced
iowa
stands
first
with
banks
of
the
smaller
class
while
texas
oklahoma
indian
territory
and
the
middle
and
western
sections
of
the
country
have
also
availed
themselves
largely
of
the
privileges
under
the
new
law
a
large
increase
in
national
banknote
circulation
has
resulted
from
the
provision
of
the
act
which
permits
national
banks
to
issue
circulating
notes
to
the
par
value
of
the
united
states
bonds
deposited
as
security
instead
of
only
go
per
cent
thereof
as
heretofore
the
increase
in
circulating
no
tes
from
march
to
november
is
the
party
in
power
is
committed
to
such
legislation
as
will
better
make
the
currency
responsive
to
the
varying
needs
of
business
at
all
seasons
and
in
all
sections
our
foreign
trade
shows
a
remarkable
record
of
commercial
and
industrial
progress
the
total
of
imports
and
exports
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
country
exceeded
two
billions
of
dollars
the
exports
are
greater
than
they
have
ever
been
before
the
total
for
the
fiscal
year
being
an
increase
over
of
an
increase
over
of
over
of
and
greater
than
by
the
growth
of
manufactures
in
the
united
states
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
exports
of
manufactured
products
largely
exceed
those
of
any
previous
year
their
value
for
being
against
in
an
increase
of
per
cent
agricultural
products
were
also
exported
during
in
greater
volume
than
in
the
total
for
the
year
being
against
in
the
imports
for
the
year
amounted
to
an
increase
over
of
this
increase
is
largely
in
materials
for
manufacture
and
is
in
response
to
the
rapid
development
of
manufacturing
in
the
united
states
while
there
was
imported
for
use
in
manufactures
in
material
to
the
value
of
in
excess
of
it
is
reassuring
to
observe
that
there
is
a
tendency
toward
decrease
in
the
importation
of
articles
manufactured
ready
for
consumption
which
in
formed
per
cent
of
the
total
imports
against
per
cent
in
and
per
cent
in
i
recommend
that
the
congress
at
its
present
session
reduce
the
internalrevenue
taxes
imposed
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
war
with
spain
in
the
sum
of
thirty
millions
of
dollars
this
reduction
should
be
secured
by
the
remission
of
those
taxes
which
experience
has
shown
to
be
the
most
burdensome
to
the
industries
of
the
people
i
specially
urge
that
there
be
included
in
whatever
reduction
is
made
the
legacy
tax
on
bequests
for
public
uses
of
a
literary
educational
or
charitable
character
american
vessels
during
the
past
three
years
have
carried
about
per
cent
of
our
exports
and
imports
foreign
ships
should
carry
the
least
not
the
greatest
part
of
american
trade
the
remarkable
growth
of
our
steel
industries
the
progress
of
shipbuilding
for
the
domestic
trade
and
our
steadily
maintained
expenditures
for
the
navy
have
created
an
opportunity
to
place
the
united
states
in
the
first
rank
of
commercial
maritime
powers
besides
realizing
a
proper
national
aspiration
this
will
mean
the
establishment
and
healthy
growth
along
all
our
coasts
of
a
distinctive
national
industry
expanding
the
field
for
the
profitable
employment
of
labor
and
capital
it
will
increase
the
transportation
facilities
and
reduce
freight
charges
on
the
vast
volume
of
products
brought
from
the
interior
to
the
seaboard
for
export
and
will
strengthen
an
arm
of
the
national
defense
upon
which
the
founders
of
the
government
and
their
successors
have
relied
in
again
urging
immediate
action
by
the
congress
on
measures
to
promote
american
shipping
and
foreign
trade
i
direct
attention
to
the
recommendations
on
the
subject
in
previous
messages
and
particularly
to
the
opinion
expressed
in
the
message
of
i
am
satisfied
the
judgment
of
the
country
favors
the
policy
of
aid
to
our
merchant
marine
which
will
broaden
our
commerce
and
markets
and
upbuild
our
seacarrying
capacity
for
the
products
of
agriculture
and
manufacture
which
with
the
increase
of
our
navy
mean
more
work
and
wages
to
our
countrymen
as
well
as
a
safeguard
to
american
interests
in
every
part
of
the
world
the
attention
of
the
congress
is
invited
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
annual
report
for
legislation
in
behalf
of
the
revenuecutter
service
and
favorable
action
is
urged
in
my
last
annual
message
to
the
congress
i
called
attention
to
the
necessity
for
early
action
to
remedy
such
evils
as
might
be
found
to
exist
in
connection
with
combinations
of
capital
organized
into
trusts
and
again
invite
attention
to
my
discussion
of
the
subject
at
that
time
which
concluded
with
these
words
it
is
apparent
that
uniformity
of
legislation
upon
this
subject
in
the
several
states
is
much
to
be
desired
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
such
uniformity
founded
in
a
wise
and
just
discrimination
between
what
is
injurious
and
what
is
useful
and
necessary
in
business
operations
may
be
obtained
and
that
means
may
be
found
for
the
congress
within
the
limitations
of
its
constitutional
power
so
to
supplement
an
effective
code
of
state
legislation
as
to
make
a
complete
system
of
laws
throughout
the
united
states
adequate
to
compel
a
general
observance
of
the
salutary
rules
to
which
i
have
referred
the
whole
question
is
so
important
and
farreaching
that
i
am
sure
no
part
of
it
will
be
lightly
considered
but
every
phase
of
it
will
have
the
studied
deliberation
of
the
congress
resulting
in
wise
and
judicious
action
restraint
upon
such
combinations
as
are
injurious
and
which
are
within
federal
jurisdiction
should
be
promptly
applied
by
the
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
i
dwelt
at
some
length
upon
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
philippines
while
seeking
to
impress
upon
you
that
the
grave
responsibility
of
the
future
government
of
those
islands
rests
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states
i
abstained
from
recommending
at
that
time
a
specific
and
final
form
of
government
for
the
territory
actually
held
by
the
united
states
forces
and
in
which
as
long
as
insurrection
continues
the
military
arm
must
necessarily
be
supreme
i
stated
my
purpose
until
the
congress
shall
have
made
the
formal
expression
of
its
will
to
use
the
authority
vested
in
me
by
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
to
uphold
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
in
those
distant
islands
as
in
all
other
places
where
our
flag
rightfully
floats
placing
to
that
end
at
the
disposal
of
the
army
and
navy
all
the
means
which
the
liberality
of
the
congress
and
the
people
have
provided
no
contrary
expression
of
the
will
of
the
congress
having
been
made
i
have
steadfastly
pursued
the
purpose
so
declared
employing
the
civil
arm
as
well
toward
the
accomplishment
of
pacification
and
the
institution
of
local
governments
within
the
lines
of
authority
and
law
progress
in
the
hopedfor
direction
has
been
favorable
our
forces
have
successfully
controlled
the
greater
part
of
the
islands
overcoming
the
organized
forces
of
the
insurgents
and
carrying
order
and
administrative
regularity
to
all
quarters
what
opposition
remains
is
for
the
most
part
scattered
obeying
no
concerted
plan
of
strategic
action
operating
only
by
the
methods
common
to
the
traditions
of
guerrilla
warfare
which
while
ineffective
to
alter
the
general
control
now
established
are
still
sufficient
to
beget
insecurity
among
the
populations
that
have
felt
the
good
results
of
our
control
and
thus
delay
the
conferment
upon
them
of
the
fuller
measures
of
local
selfgovernment
of
education
and
of
industrial
and
agricultural
development
which
we
stand
ready
to
give
to
them
by
the
spring
of
this
year
the
effective
opposition
of
the
dissatisfied
tagals
to
the
authority
of
the
united
states
was
virtually
ended
thus
opening
the
door
for
the
extension
of
a
stable
administration
over
much
of
the
territory
of
the
archipelago
desiring
to
bring
this
about
i
appointed
in
march
last
a
civil
commission
composed
of
the
hon
william
h
taft
of
ohio
prof
dean
c
worcester
of
michigan
the
hon
luke
i
wright
of
tennessee
the
hon
henry
c
ide
of
vermont
and
prof
bernard
moses
of
california
the
aims
of
their
mission
and
the
scope
of
their
authority
are
clearly
set
forth
in
my
instructions
of
april
addressed
to
the
secretary
of
war
to
be
transmitted
to
them
in
the
message
transmitted
to
the
congress
on
the
th
of
december
i
said
speaking
of
the
philippine
islands
as
long
as
the
insurrection
continues
the
military
arm
must
necessarily
be
supreme
but
there
is
no
reason
why
steps
should
not
be
taken
from
time
to
time
to
inaugurate
governments
essentially
popular
in
their
form
as
fast
as
territory
is
held
and
controlled
by
our
troops
to
this
end
i
am
considering
the
advisability
of
the
return
of
the
commission
or
such
of
the
members
thereof
as
can
be
secured
to
aid
the
existing
authorities
and
facilitate
this
work
throughout
the
islands
to
give
effect
to
the
intention
thus
expressed
i
have
appointed
hon
william
h
taft
of
ohio
prof
dean
c
worcester
of
michigan
non
luke
i
wright
of
tennessee
hon
henry
c
ide
of
vermont
and
prof
bernard
moses
of
california
commissioners
to
the
philippine
islands
to
continue
and
perfect
the
work
of
organizing
and
establishing
civil
government
already
commenced
by
the
military
authorities
subject
in
all
respects
to
any
laws
which
congress
may
hereafter
enact
the
commissioners
named
will
meet
and
act
as
a
board
and
the
hon
william
h
taft
t
is
designated
as
president
of
the
board
it
is
probable
that
the
transfer
of
authority
from
military
commanders
to
civil
officers
will
be
gradual
and
will
occupy
a
considerable
period
its
successful
accomplishment
and
the
maintenance
of
peace
and
order
in
the
meantime
will
require
the
most
perfect
cooperation
between
the
civil
and
military
authorities
in
the
islands
and
both
should
be
directed
during
the
transition
period
by
the
same
executive
department
the
commission
will
therefore
report
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
all
their
action
will
be
subject
to
your
approval
and
control
you
will
instruct
the
commission
to
proceed
to
the
city
of
manila
where
they
will
make
their
principal
office
and
to
communicate
with
the
military
governor
of
the
philippine
islands
whom
you
will
at
the
same
time
direct
to
render
to
them
every
assistance
within
his
power
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
without
hampering
them
by
too
specific
instructions
they
should
in
general
be
enjoined
after
making
themselves
familiar
with
the
conditions
and
needs
of
the
country
to
devote
their
attention
in
the
first
instance
to
the
establishment
of
municipal
governments
in
which
the
natives
of
the
islands
both
in
the
cities
and
in
the
rural
communities
shall
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
manage
their
own
local
affairs
to
the
fullest
extent
of
which
they
are
capable
a
nd
subject
to
the
least
degree
of
supervision
and
control
which
a
careful
study
of
their
capacities
and
observation
of
the
workings
of
native
control
show
to
be
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
law
order
and
loyalty
the
next
subject
in
order
of
importance
should
be
the
organization
of
government
in
the
larger
administrative
divisions
corresponding
to
counties
departments
or
provinces
in
which
the
common
interests
of
many
or
several
municipalities
falling
within
the
same
tribal
lines
or
the
same
natural
geographical
limits
may
best
be
subserved
by
a
common
administration
whenever
the
commission
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
islands
is
such
that
the
central
administration
may
safely
be
transferred
from
military
to
civil
control
they
will
report
that
conclusion
to
you
with
their
recommendations
as
to
the
form
of
central
government
to
be
established
for
the
purpose
of
taking
over
the
control
beginning
with
the
st
day
of
september
the
authority
to
exercise
subject
to
my
approval
through
the
secretary
of
war
that
part
of
the
power
of
government
in
the
philippine
islands
which
is
of
a
legislative
nature
is
to
be
transferred
from
the
military
governor
of
the
islands
to
this
commission
to
be
thereafter
exercised
by
them
in
the
place
and
stead
of
the
military
governor
under
such
rules
and
regulations
as
you
shall
prescribe
until
the
establishment
of
the
civil
central
government
for
the
islands
contemplated
in
the
last
foregoing
paragraph
or
until
congress
shall
otherwise
provide
exercise
of
this
legislative
authority
will
include
the
making
of
rules
and
orders
having
the
effect
of
law
for
the
raising
of
revenue
by
taxes
customs
duties
and
imposts
the
appropriation
and
expenditure
of
public
funds
of
the
islands
the
establishment
of
an
educational
system
throughout
the
islands
the
establishment
of
a
system
to
secure
an
efficient
civil
service
the
organization
and
establishment
of
courts
the
organization
and
establishment
of
municipal
and
departmental
governments
and
all
other
matters
of
a
civil
nature
for
which
the
military
governor
is
now
competent
to
provide
by
rules
or
orders
of
a
legislative
character
the
commission
will
also
have
power
during
the
same
period
to
appoint
to
office
such
officers
under
the
judicial
educational
and
civilservice
systems
and
in
the
municipal
and
departmental
governments
as
shall
be
provided
for
until
the
complete
transfer
of
control
the
military
governor
will
remain
the
chief
executive
head
of
the
government
of
the
islands
and
will
exercise
the
executive
authority
now
possessed
by
him
and
not
herein
expressly
assigned
to
the
commission
subject
however
to
the
rules
and
orders
enacted
by
the
commission
in
the
exercise
of
the
legislative
powers
conferred
upon
them
in
the
meantime
the
municipal
and
departmental
governments
will
continue
to
report
to
the
military
governor
and
be
subject
to
his
administrative
supervision
and
control
under
your
direction
but
that
supervision
and
control
will
be
confined
within
the
narrowest
limits
consistent
with
the
requirement
that
the
powers
of
government
in
the
municipalities
and
departments
shall
be
honestly
and
effectively
exercised
and
that
law
and
order
and
individual
freedom
shall
be
maintained
all
legislative
rules
and
orders
establishments
of
government
and
appointments
to
office
by
the
commission
will
take
effect
immediately
or
at
such
times
as
they
shall
designate
subject
to
your
approval
and
action
upon
the
coming
in
of
the
commissions
reports
which
are
to
be
made
from
time
to
time
as
their
action
is
taken
wherever
civil
governments
are
constituted
under
the
direction
of
the
commission
such
military
posts
garrisons
and
forces
will
be
continued
for
the
suppression
of
insurrection
and
brigandage
and
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
as
the
military
commander
shall
deem
requisite
and
the
military
forces
shall
be
at
all
times
subject
under
his
orders
to
the
call
of
the
civil
authorities
for
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
and
the
enforcement
of
their
authority
in
the
establishment
of
municipal
governments
the
commission
will
take
as
the
basis
of
their
work
the
governments
established
by
the
military
governor
under
his
order
of
august
and
under
the
report
of
the
board
constituted
by
the
military
governor
by
his
order
of
january
to
formulate
and
report
a
plan
of
municipal
government
of
which
his
honor
cayetano
arellano
president
of
the
audiencia
was
chairman
and
they
will
give
to
the
conclusions
of
that
board
the
weight
and
consideration
which
the
high
character
and
distinguished
abilities
of
its
members
justify
in
the
constitution
of
departmental
or
provincial
governments
they
will
give
especial
attention
to
the
existing
government
of
the
island
of
negros
constituted
with
the
approval
of
the
people
of
that
island
under
the
order
of
the
military
governor
of
july
and
after
verifying
so
far
as
may
be
practicable
the
reports
of
the
successful
working
of
that
government
they
will
be
guided
by
the
experience
thus
acquired
so
far
as
it
may
be
applicable
to
the
condition
existing
in
other
portions
of
the
philippines
they
will
avail
themselves
to
the
fullest
degree
practicable
of
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
previous
commission
to
the
philippines
in
the
distribution
of
powers
among
the
governments
organized
by
the
commission
the
presumption
is
always
to
be
in
favor
of
the
smaller
subdivision
so
that
all
the
powers
which
can
properly
be
exercised
by
the
municipal
government
shall
be
vested
in
that
government
and
all
the
powers
of
a
more
general
character
which
can
be
exercised
by
the
departmental
government
shall
be
vested
in
that
government
and
so
that
in
the
governmental
system
which
is
the
result
of
the
process
the
central
government
of
the
islands
following
the
example
of
the
distribution
of
the
powers
between
the
states
and
the
national
government
of
the
united
states
shall
have
no
direct
administration
except
of
matters
of
purely
general
concern
and
shall
have
only
such
supervision
and
control
over
local
governments
as
may
be
necessary
to
secure
and
enforce
faithful
and
efficient
administration
by
local
officers
the
many
different
degrees
of
civilization
and
varieties
of
custom
and
capacity
among
the
people
of
the
different
islands
preclude
very
definite
instruction
as
to
the
part
which
the
people
shall
take
in
the
selection
of
their
own
officers
but
these
general
rules
are
to
be
observed
that
in
all
cases
the
municipal
officers
who
administer
the
local
affairs
of
the
people
are
to
be
selected
by
the
people
and
that
wherever
officers
of
more
extended
jurisdiction
are
to
be
selected
in
any
way
natives
of
the
islands
are
to
be
preferred
and
if
they
can
be
found
competent
and
willing
to
perform
the
duties
they
are
to
receive
the
offices
in
preference
to
any
others
it
will
be
necessary
to
fill
some
offices
for
the
present
with
americans
which
after
a
time
may
well
be
filled
by
natives
of
the
islands
as
soon
as
practicable
a
system
for
ascertaining
the
merit
and
fitness
of
candidates
for
civil
office
should
be
put
in
force
an
indispensable
qualification
for
all
offices
and
positions
of
trust
and
authority
in
the
islands
must
be
absolute
and
unconditional
loyalty
to
the
united
states
and
absolute
and
unhampered
authority
and
power
to
remove
and
punish
any
officer
deviating
from
that
standard
must
at
all
times
be
retained
in
the
hands
of
the
central
authority
of
the
islands
in
all
the
forms
of
government
and
administrative
provisions
which
they
are
authorized
to
prescribe
the
commission
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
government
which
they
are
establishing
is
designed
not
for
our
satisfaction
or
for
the
expression
of
our
theoretical
views
but
for
the
happiness
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
and
the
measures
adopted
should
be
made
to
conform
to
their
customs
their
habits
and
even
heir
prejudices
to
the
fullest
extent
consistent
with
the
accomplishment
of
the
indispensable
requisites
of
just
and
effective
government
at
the
same
time
the
commission
should
bear
in
mind
and
the
people
of
the
islands
should
be
made
plainly
to
understand
that
there
are
certain
great
principles
of
government
which
have
been
made
the
basis
of
our
governmental
system
which
we
deem
essential
to
the
rule
of
law
and
the
maintenance
of
individual
freedom
and
of
which
they
have
unfortunately
been
denied
the
experience
possessed
by
us
that
there
are
also
certain
practical
rules
of
government
which
we
have
found
to
be
essential
to
the
preservation
of
these
great
principles
of
liberty
and
law
and
that
these
principles
and
these
rules
of
government
must
be
established
and
maintained
in
their
islands
for
the
sake
of
their
liberty
and
happiness
however
much
they
may
conflict
with
the
customs
or
laws
of
procedure
with
which
they
are
familiar
it
is
evident
that
the
most
enlightened
thought
of
the
philippine
islands
fully
appreciates
the
importance
of
these
principles
and
rules
and
they
will
inevitably
within
a
short
time
command
universal
assent
upon
every
division
and
branch
of
the
government
of
the
philippines
therefore
must
be
imposed
these
inviolable
rules
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process

is
done
to
have
regard
for
substantial
rights
and
equity
disregarding
technicalities
so
far
as
substantial
right
permits
and
to
observe
the
following
rules
that
the
provision
of
the
treaty
of
paris
pledging
the
united
states
to
the
protection
of
all
rights
of
property
in
the
islands
and
as
well
the
principle
of
our
own
government
which
prohibits
the
taking
of
private
property
without
due
process
of
law
shall
not
be
violated
that
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
islands
which
should
be
a
paramount
consideration
shall
be
attained
consistently
with
this
rule
of
property
right
that
if
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
public
interest
of
the
people
of
the
islands
to
dispose
of
claims
to
property
which
the
commission
finds
to
be
not
lawfully
acquired
and
held
disposition
shall
be
made
thereof
by
due
legal
procedure
in
which
there
shall
be
full
opportunity
for
fair
and
impartial
hearing
and
judgment
that
if
the
same
public
interests
require
the
extinguishment
of
property
rights
lawfully
acquired
and
held
due
compensation
shall
be
made
out
of
the
public
treasury
therefore
that
no
form
of
religion
and
no
minister
of
religion
shall
be
forced
upon
any
community
or
upon
any
citizen
of
the
islands
that
upon
the
other
hand
no
minister
of
religion
shall
be
interfered
with
or
molested
in
following
his
calling
and
that
the
separation
between
state
and
church
shall
be
real
entire
and
absolute
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
promote
and
extend
and
as
they
find
occasion
to
improve
the
system
of
education
already
inaugurated
by
the
military
authorities
in
doing
this
they
should
regard
as
of
first
importance
the
extension
of
a
system
of
primary
education
which
shall
be
free
to
all
and
which
shall
tend
to
fit
the
people
for
the
duties
of
citizenship
and
for
the
ordinary
avocations
of
a
civilized
community
this
instruction
should
be
given
in
the
first
instance
in
every
part
of
the
islands
in
the
language
of
the
people
in
view
of
the
great
number
of
languages
spoken
by
the
different
tribes
it
is
especially
important
to
the
prosperity
of
the
islands
that
a
common
medium
of
communication
may
be
established
and
it
is
obviously
desirable
that
this
medium
should
be
the
english
language
especial
attention
should
be
at
once
given
to
affording
full
opportunity
to
all
the
people
of
the
islands
to
acquire
the
use
of
the
english
language
it
may
be
well
that
the
main
changes
which
should
be
made
in
the
system
of
taxation
and
in
the
body
of
the
laws
under
which
the
people
are
governed
except
such
changes
as
have
already
been
made
by
the
military
government
should
be
relegated
to
the
civil
government
which
is
to
be
established
under
the
auspices
of
the
commission
it
will
however
be
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
inquire
diligently
as
to
whether
there
are
any
further
changes
which
ought
not
to
be
delayed
and
if
so
they
are
authorized
to
make
such
changes
subject
to
your
approval
in
doing
so
they
are
to
bear
in
mind
that
taxes
which
tend
penalize
or
repress
industry
and
enterprise
are
to
be
avoided
that
provisions
for
taxation
should
be
simple
so
that
they
may
be
understood
by
the
people
that
they
should
affect
the
fewest
practicable
subjects
of
taxation
which
will
serve
for
the
general
distribution
of
the
burden
the
main
body
of
the
laws
which
regulate
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
people
should
be
maintained
with
as
little
interference
as
possible
changes
made
should
be
mainly
in
procedure
and
in
the
criminal
laws
to
secure
speedy
and
impartial
trials
and
at
the
same
time
effective
administration
and
respect
for
individual
rights
in
dealing
with
the
uncivilized
tribes
of
the
islands
the
commission
should
adopt
the
same
course
followed
by
congress
in
permitting
the
tribes
of
our
north
american
indians
to
maintain
their
tribal
organization
and
government
and
under
which
many
of
those
tribes
are
now
living
in
peace
and
contentment
surrounded
by
a
civilization
to
which
they
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
conform
such
tribal
governments
should
however
be
subjected
to
wise
and
firm
regulation
and
without
undue
or
petty
interference
constant
and
active
effort
should
be
exercised
to
prevent
barbarous
practices
and
introduce
civilized
customs
upon
all
officers
and
employees
of
the
united
states
both
civil
and
military
should
be
impressed
a
sense
of
the
duty
to
observe
not
merely
the
material
but
the
personal
and
social
rights
of
the
people
of
the
islands
and
to
treat
them
with
the
same
courtesy
and
respect
for
their
personal
dignity
which
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
accustomed
w
require
from
each
other
the
articles
of
capitulation
of
the
city
of
manila
on
the
th
of
august
concluded
with
these
words
this
city
its
inhabitants
its
churches
and
religious
worship
its
educational
establishments
and
its
private
property
of
all
descriptions
are
placed
under
the
special
safeguard
of
the
faith
and
honor
of
the
american
army
i
believe
that
this
pledge
has
been
faithfully
kept
as
high
and
sacred
an
obligation
rests
upon
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
give
protection
for
property
and
life
civil
and
religious
freedom
and
wise
firm
and
unselfish
guidance
in
the
paths
of
peace
and
prosperity
to
all
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
i
charge
this
commission
to
labor
for
the
full
performance
of
this
obligation
which
concerns
the
honor
and
conscience
of
their
country
in
the
firm
hope
that
through
their
labors
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippine
islands
may
come
to
look
back
with
gratitude
to
the
day
when
god
gave
victory
to
american
arms
at
manila
and
set
their
land
under
the
sovereignty
and
the
protection
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
coincidently
with
the
entrance
of
the
commission
upon
its
labors
i
caused
to
be
issued
by
general
macarthur
the
military
governor
of
the
philippines
on
june
a
proclamation
of
amnesty
in
generous
terms
of
which
many
of
the
insurgents
took
advantage
among
them
a
number
of
important
leaders
this
commission
composed
of
eminent
citizens
representing
the
diverse
geographical
and
political
interests
of
the
country
and
bringing
to
their
task
the
ripe
fruits
of
long
and
intelligent
service
in
educational
administrative
and
judicial
careers
made
great
progress
from
the
outset
as
early
as
august
it
submitted
a
preliminary
report
which
will
be
laid
before
the
congress
and
from
which
it
appears
that
already
the
good
effects
of
returning
order
are
felt
that
business
interrupted
by
hostilities
is
improving
as
peace
extends
that
a
larger
area
is
under
sugar
cultivation
than
ever
before
that
the
customs
revenues
are
greater
than
at
any
time
during
the
spanish
rule
that
economy
and
efficiency
in
the
military
administration
have
created
a
surplus
fund
of
available
for
needed
public
improvements
that
a
stringent
civilservice
law
is
in
preparation
that
railroad
communications
are
expanding
opening
up
rich
districts
and
that
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
education
is
being
organized
later
reports
from
the
commission
show
yet
more
encouraging
advance
toward
insuring
the
benefits
of
liberty
and
good
government
to
the
filipinos
in
the
interest
of
humanity
and
with
the
aim
of
building
up
an
enduring
selfsupporting
and
selfadministering
community
in
those
far
eastern
seas
i
would
impress
upon
the
congress
that
whatever
legislation
may
be
enacted
in
respect
to
the
philippine
islands
should
be
along
these
generous
lines
the
fortune
of
war
has
thrown
upon
this
nation
an
unsought
trust
which
should
be
unselfishly
discharged
and
devolved
upon
this
government
a
moral
as
well
as
material
responsibility
toward
these
millions
whom
we
have
freed
from
an
oppressive
yoke
i
have
on
another
occasion
called
the
filipinos
the
wards
of
the
nation
our
obligation
as
guardian
was
not
lightly
assumed
it
must
not
be
otherwise
than
honestly
fulfilled
aiming
first
of
all
to
benefit
those
who
have
come
under
our
fostering
care
it
is
our
duty
so
to
treat
them
that
our
flag
may
be
no
less
beloved
in
the
mountains
of
luzon
and
the
fertile
zones
of
mindanao
and
negros
than
it
is
at
home
that
there
as
here
it
shall
be
the
revered
symbol
of
liberty
enlightenment
and
progress
in
every
avenue
of
development
the
filipinos
are
a
race
quick
to
learn
and
to
profit
by
knowledge
he
would
be
rash
who
with
the
teachings
of
contemporaneous
history
in
view
would
fix
a
limit
to
the
degree
of
culture
and
advancement
yet
within
the
reach
of
these
people
if
our
duty
toward
them
be
faithfully
performed
the
civil
government
of
puerto

provided
for
by
the

and
the

conferring
upon
the
secretary
of
the
interior
supervision
over
the
public
lands
in

puerto

of
spain
at
the

and
that

be
prescribed
by

on

i
directed
that
a
call
be

for
an

a
basis
for
a
stable
and
independent
government
in
the
island
in

thereof
the
military
governor
issued
the
following
instructions

declared
that

are
and
of

hereby
disclaims
any
disposition
or
intention
to
exercise
sovereignty
jurisdiction
or
control
over
said
island
except
for
the
pacification
thereof
and
asserts
its
determination
when
that
is
accomplished
to
leave
the
government
and
control
of
the
island
to
its
people
and
whereas
the
people
of
cuba
have
established
municipal
governments
deriving
their
authority
from
the
suffrages
of
the
people
given
under
just
and
equal
laws
and
are
now
ready
in
like
manner
to
proceed
to
the
establishment
of
a
general
government
which
shall
assume
and
exercise
sovereignty
jurisdiction
and
control
over
the
island
therefore
it
is
ordered
that
a
general
election
be
held
in
the
island
of
cuba
on
the
third
saturday
of
september
in
the
year
nineteen
hundred
to
elect
delegates
to
a
convention
to
meet
in
the
city
of
havana
at
twelve
oclock
noon
on
the
first
monday
of
november
in
the
year
nineteen
hundred
to
frame
and
adopt
a
constitution
for
the
people
of
cuba
and
as
a
part
thereof
to
provide
for
and
agree
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
upon
the
relations
to
exist
between
that
government
and
the
government
of
cuba
and
to
provide
for
the
election
by
the
people
of
officers
under
such
constitution
and
the
transfer
of
government
to
the
officers
so
elected
the
election
will
be
held
in
the
several
voting
precincts
of
the
island
under
and
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
electoral
law
of
april
and
the
amendments
thereof
the
election
was
held
on
the
th
of
september
and
the
convention
assembled
on
the
th
of
november
and
is
now
in
session
in
calling
the
convention
to
order
the
military
governor
of
cuba
made
the
following
statement
as
military
governor
of
the
island
representing
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
call
this
convention
to
order
it
will
be
your
duty
first
to
frame
and
adopt
a
constitution
for
cuba
and
when
that
has
been
done
to
formulate
what
in
your
opinion
ought
to
be
the
relations
between
cuba
and
the
united
states
the
constitution
must
be
adequate
to
secure
a
stable
orderly
and
free
government
when
you
have
formulated
the
relations
which
in
your
opinion
ought
to
exist
between
cuba
and
the
united
states
the
government
of
the
united
states
will
doubtless
take
such
action
on
its
part
as
shall
lead
to
a
final
and
authoritative
agreement
between
the
people
of
the
two
countries
to
the
promotion
of
their
common
interests
all
friends
of
cuba
will
follow
your
deliberations
with
the
deepest
interest
earnestly
desiring
that
you
shall
reach
just
conclusions
and
that
by
the
dignity
individual
selfrestraint
and
wise
conservatism
which
shall
characterize
your
proceedings
the
capacity
of
the
cuban
people
for
representative
government
may
be
signally
illustrated
the
fundamental
distinction
between
true
representative
government
and
dictatorship
is
that
in
the
former
every
representative
of
the
people
in
whatever
office
confines
himself
strictly
within
the
limits
of
his
defined
powers
without
such
restraint
there
can
be
no
free
constitutional
government
under
the
order
pursuant
to
which
you
have
been
elected
and
convened
you
have
no
duty
and
no
authority
to
take
part
in
the
present
government
of
the
island
your
powers
are
strictly
limited
by
the
terms
of
that
order
when
the
convention
concludes
its
labors
i
will
transmit
to
the
congress
the
constitution
as
framed
by
the
convention
for
its
consideration
and
for
such
action
as
it
may
deem
advisable
i
renew
the
recommendation
made
in
my
special
message
of
february
as
to
the
necessity
for
cable
communication
between
the
united
states
and
hawaii
with
extension
to
manila
since
then
circumstances
have
strikingly
emphasized
this
need
surveys
have
shown
the
entire
feasibility
of
a
chain
of
cables
which
at
each
stopping
place
shall
touch
on
american
territory
so
that
the
system
shall
be
under
our
own
complete
control
manila
once
within
telegraphic
reach
connection
with
the
systems
of
the
asiatic
coast
would
open
increased
and
profitable
opportunities
for
a
more
direct
cable
route
from
our
shores
to
the
orient
than
is
now
afforded
by
the
transatlantic
continental
and
transasian
lines
i
urge
attention
to
this
important
matter
the
present
strength
of
the
army
is
men
regulars
and
volunteers
under
the
act
of
march
on
the
th
of
june
next
the
present
volunteer
force
will
be
discharged
and
the
regular
army
will
be
reduced
to
officers
and
enlisted
men
in
a
board
of
officers
convened
by
president
cleveland
adopted
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
coastdefense
fortifications
which
involved
the
outlay
of
something
over
one
hundred
million
dollars
this
plan
received
the
approval
of
the
congress
and
since
then
regular
appropriations
have
been
made
and
the
work
of
fortification
has
steadily
progressed
more
than
sixty
millions
of
dollars
have
been
invested
in
a
great
number
of
forts
and
guns
with
all
the
complicated
and
scientific
machinery
and
electrical
appliances
necessary
for
their
use
the
proper
care
of
this
defensive
machinery
requires
men
trained
in
its
use
the
number
of
men
necessary
to
perform
this
duty
alone
is
ascertained
by
the
war
department
at
a
minimum
allowance
to
be
there
are
fiftyeight
or
more
military
posts
in
the
united
states
other
than
the
coastdefense
fortifications
the
number
of
these
posts
is
being
constantly
increased
by
the
congress
more
than
have
been
expended
in
building
and
equipment
and
they
can
only
be
cared
for
by
the
regular
army
the
posts
now
in
existence
and
others
to
be
built
provide
for
accommodations
for
and
if
fully
garrisoned
require
troops
many
of
these
posts
are
along
our
frontier
or
at
important
strategic
points
the
occupation
of
which
is
necessary
we
have
in
cuba
between
and
troops
for
the
present
our
troops
in
that
island
cannot
be
withdrawn
or
materially
diminished
and
certainly
not
until
the
conclusion
of
the
labors
of
the
constitutional
convention
now
in
session
and
a
government
provided
by
the
new
constitution
shall
have
been
established
and
its
stability
assured
in
puerto
rico
we
have
reduced
the
garrisons
to
which
includes
native
troops
there
is
no
room
for
further
reduction
here
we
will
be
required
to
keep
a
considerable
force
in
the
philippine
islands
for
some
time
to
come
from
the
best
information
obtainable
we
will
need
there
for
the
immediate
future
from
to
men
i
am
sure
the
number
may
be
reduced
as
the
insurgents
shall
come
to
acknowledge
the
authority
of
the
united
states
of
which
there
are
assuring
indications
it
must
be
apparent
that
we
will
require
an
army
of
about
and
that
during
present
conditions
in
cuba
and
the
philippines
the
president
should
have
authority
to
increase
the
force
to
the
present
number
of
included
in
this
number
authority
should
be
given
to
raise
native
troops
in
the
philippines
up
to
which
the
taft
commission
believe
will
be
more
effective
in
detecting
and
suppressing
guerrillas
assassins
and
ladrones
than
our
own
soldiers
the
full
discussion
of
this
subject
by
the
secretary
of
war
in
his
annual
report
is
called
to
your
earnest
attention
i
renew
the
recommendation
made
in
my
last
annual
message
that
the
congress
provide
a
special
medal
of
honor
for
the
volunteers
regulars
sailors
and
marines
on
duty
in
the
philippines
who
voluntarily
remained
in
the
service
after
their
terms
of
enlistment
had
expired
i
favor
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
the
detail
oil
officers
from
the
line
of
the
army
when
vacancies
occur
in
the
adjutantgenerals
department
inspectorgenerals
department
quartermasters
department
subsistence
department
pay
department
ordnance
department
and
signal
corps
the
army
cannot
be
too
highly
commended
for
its
faithful
and
effective
service
in
active
military
operations
in
the
field
and
the
difficult
work
of
civil
administration
the
continued
and
rapid
growth
of
the
postal
service
is
a
sure
index
of
the
great
and
increasing
business
activity
of
the
country
its
most
striking
new
development
is
the
extension
of
rural
free
delivery
this
has
come
almost
wholly
within
the
last
year
at
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
the
number
of
routes
in
operation
was
only
and
most
of
these
had
been
running
less
than
twelve
months
on
the
th
of
november
the
number
had
increased
to
reaching
into
fortyfour
states
and
territories
and
serving
a
population
of
the
number
of
applications
now
pending
and
awaiting
action
nearly
equals
all
those
granted
up
to
the
present
time
and
by
the
close
of
the
current
fiscal
year
about
routes
will
have
been
established
providing
for
the
daily
delivery
of
mails
at
the
scattered
homes
of
about
three
and
a
half
millions
of
rural
population
this
service
ameliorates
the
isolation
of
farm
life
conduces
to
good
roads
and
quickens
and
extends
the
dissemination
of
general
information
experience
thus
far
has
tended
to
allay
the
apprehension
that
it
would
be
so
expensive
as
to
forbid
its
general
adoption
or
make
it
a
serious
burden
its
actual
application
has
shown
that
it
increases
postal
receipts
and
can
be
accompanied
by
reductions
in
other
branches
of
the
service
so
that
the
augmented
revenues
and
the
accomplished
savings
together
materially
reduce
the
net
cost
the
evidences
which
point
to
these
conclusions
are
presented
in
detail
in
the
annual
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
which
with
its
recommendations
is
commended
to
t
he
consideration
of
the
congress
the
full
development
of
this
special
service
however
requires
such
a
large
outlay
of
money
that
it
should
be
undertaken
only
after
a
careful
study
and
thorough
understanding
of
all
that
it
involves
very
efficient
service
has
been
rendered
by
the
navy
in
connection
with
the
insurrection
in
the
philippines
and
the
recent
disturbance
in
china
a
very
satisfactory
settlement
has
been
made
of
the
longpending
question
of
the
manufacture
of
armor
plate
a
reasonable
price
has
been
secured
and
the
necessity
for
a
government
armor
plant
avoided
i
approve
of
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
for
new
vessels
and
for
additional
officers
and
men
which
the
required
increase
of
the
navy
makes
necessary
i
commend
to
the
favorable
action
of
the
congress
the
measure
now
pending
for
the
erection
of
a
statue
to
the
memory
of
the
late
admiral
david
d
porter
i
commend
also
the
establishment
of
a
national
naval
reserve
and
of
the
grade
of
viceadmiral
provision
should
be
made
as
recommended
by
the
secretary
for
suitable
rewards
for
special
merit
many
officers
who
rendered
the
most
distinguished
service
during
the
recent
war
with
spain
have
received
in
return
no
recognition
from
the
congress
the
total
area
of
public
lands
as
given
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
approximately
acres
of
which
acres
are
undisposed
of
and
acres
have
been
reserved
for
various
purposes
the
public
lands
disposed
of
during
the
year
amount
to
acres
including
acres
of
indian
lands
an
increase
of
over
the
preceding
year
the
total
receipts
from
the
sale
of
public
lands
during
the
fiscal
year
were
an
increase
of
over
the
preceding
year
the
results
obtained
from
our
forest
policy
have
demonstrated
its
wisdom
and
the
necessity
in
the
interest
of
the
public
for
its
continuance
and
increased
appropriations
by
the
congress
for
the
carrying
on
of
the
work

believes
that
by
the
operations
of
this
act
the
number
of
persons
pensioned
under
it
will
increase
and
the

the
governor
of

recommends
legislation
looking
to
the
development
of
such
water
supply
as
may
exist
on
the
public
lands
with
a
view
of
promoting
land
settlement
the
earnest
consideration
of
the
congress
is
invited
to
this
important
recommendation
and
others
as
embodied
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
director
of
the
census
states
that
the
work
in
connection
with
the
twelfth
census
is
progressing
favorably
this
national
undertaking
ordered
by
the
congress
each
decade
has
finally
resulted
in
the
collection
of
an
aggregation
of
statistical
facts
to
determine
the
industrial
growth
of
the
country
its
manufacturing
and
mechanical
resources
its
richness
in
mines
and
forests
the
number
of
its
agriculturists
their
farms
and
products
its
educational
and
religious
opportunities
as
well
as
questions
pertaining
to
sociological
conditions
the
labors
of
the
officials
in
charge
of
the
bureau
indicate
that
the
four
important
and
most
desired
subjects
namely
population
agricultural
manufacturing
and
vital
statistics
will
be
completed
within
the
limit
prescribed
by
the
law
of
march
the
field
work
incident
to
the
above
inquiries
is
now
practically
finished
and
as
a
result
the
population
of
the
states
and
territories
including
the
hawaiian
islands
and
alaska
has
been
announced
the
growth
of
population
during
the
last
decade
amounts
to
over
a
greater
numerical
increase
than
in
any
previous
census
in
the
history
of
the
country
bulletins
will
be
issued
as
rapidly
as
possible
giving
the
population
by
states
and
territories
by
minor
civil
divisions
several
announcements
of
this
kind
have
already
been
made
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
list
will
be
completed
by
january
other
bulletins
giving
the
results
of
the
manufacturing
and
agricultural
inquiries
will
be
given
to
the
public
as
rapidly
as
circumstances
will
admit
the
director
while
confident
of
his
ability
to
complete
the
different
branches
of
the
undertaking
in
the
allotted
time
finds
himself
embarrassed
by
the
lack
of
a
trained
force
properly
equipped
for
statistical
work
thus
raising
the
question
whether
in
the
interest
of
economy
and
a
thorough
execution
of
the
census
work
there
should
not
be
retained
in
the
government
employ
a
certain
number
of
experts
not
only
to
aid
in
the
preliminary
organization
prior
to
the
taking
of
the
decennial
census
but
in
addition
to
have
the
advantage
in
the
field
and
office
work
of
the
bureau
of
trained
assistants
to
facilitate
the
early
completion
of
this
enormous
undertaking
i
recommend
that
the
congress
at
its
present
session
apportion
representation
among
the
several
states
as
provided
by
the
constitution
the
department
of
agriculture
has
been
extending
its
work
during
the
past
year
reaching
farther
for
new
varieties
of
seeds
and
plants
cooperating
more
fully
with
the
states
and
territories
in
research
along
useful
lines
making
progress
in
meteorological
work
relating
to
lines
of
wireless

preservation
and
intelligent
harvesting
of

that
producers
may
cultivate
with
better
knowledge
of
conditions
and
helping
to
clothe
desert
places
with
grasses
suitable
to
our
and
regions
our
island
possessions
are
being
considered
that
their
peoples
may
be
helped
to
produce
the
tropical
products
now
so
extensively
brought
into
the
united
states
inquiry
into
methods
of
improving
our
roads
has
been
active
during
the
year
help
has
been
given
to
many
localities
and
scientific
investigation
of
material
in
the
states
and
territories
has
been
inaugurated
irrigation
problems
in
our
semiarid
regions
are
receiving
careful
and
increased
consideration
an
extensive
exhibit
at
paris
of
the
products
of
agriculture
has
made
the
peoples
of
many
countries
more
familiar
with
the
varied
products
of
our
fields
and
their
comparative
excellence
the
collection
of
statistics
regarding
our
crops
is
being
improved
and
sources
of
information
are
being
enlarged
to
the
end
that
producers
may
have
the
earliest
advices
regarding
crop
conditions
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
those
for
whom
it
was
established
have
shown
more
appreciation
of
the
services
of
the
department
in
my
annual
message
of
december
i
called
attention
to
the
necessity
for
some
amendment
of
the
alien
contract
law
there
still
remain
important
features
of
the
rightful
application
of
the
eighthour
law
for
the
benefit
of
labor
and
of
the
principle
of
arbitration
and
i
again
commend
these
subjects
to
the
careful
attention
of
the
congress
that
there
may
be
secured
the
best
service
possible
in
the
philippine
islands
i
have
issued
under
date
of
november
the
following
order
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
is
directed
to
render
such
assistance
as
may
be
practicable
to
the
civil
service
board
created
under
the
act
of
the
united
states
philippine
commission
for
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
an
honest
and
efficient
civil
service
in
the
philippine
islands
and
for
that
purpose
to
conduct
examinations
for
the
civi
l
service
of
the
philippine
islands
upon
the
request
of
the
civil
service
board
of
said
islands
under
such
regulations
as
may
be
agreed
upon
by
the
said
board
and
the
said
united
states
civil
service
commission
the
civil
service
commission
is
greatly
embarrassed
in
its
work
for
want
of
an
adequate
permanent
force
for
clerical
and
other
assistance
its
needs
are
fully
set
forth
in
its
report
i
invite
attention
to
the
report
and
especially
urge
upon
the
congress
that
this
important
bureau
of
the
public
service
which
passes
upon
the
qualifications
and
character
of
so
large
a
number
of
the
officers
and
employees
of
the
government
should
be
supported
by
all
needed
appropriations
to
secure
promptness
and
efficiency
i
am
very
much
impressed
with
the
statement
made
by
the
heads
of
all
the
departments
of
the
urgent
necessity
of
a
hall
of
public
records
in
every
departmental
building
in
washington
so
far
as
i
am
informed
the
space
for
official
records
is
not
only
exhausted
but
the
walls
of
rooms
are
lined
with
shelves
the
middle
floor
space
of
many
rooms
is
filled
with
the
cases
and
garrets
and
basements
which
were
never
intended
and
are
unfitted
for
their
accommodation
are
crowded
with
them
aside
from
the
inconvenience
there
is
great
danger
not
only
from
fire
but
from
the
weight
of
these
records
upon
timbers
not
intended
for
their
support
there
should
be
a
separate
building
especially
designed
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
and
preserving
the
annually
accumulating
archives
of
the
several
executive
departments
such
a
hall
need
not
be
a
costly
structure
but
should
be
so
arranged
as
to
admit
of

i
urgently
recommend
that
the
congress
take
early
action
in
this
matter
i
transmit
to
the

a
resolution
adopted
at
a
recent
meeting

american
bar
association
concerning
the

day
february
fitting
exercises
have
been

and
it
is
earnestly
desired
by
the
committee
that
the
congress
may
participate
in
this
movement
to
honor
the
memory
of
the
great
jurist
the
transfer
of
the
government
to
this
city
is
a
fact
of
great
historical
interest
among
the
people
there
is
a
feeling
of
genuine
pride
in
the
capital
of
the
republic
it
is
a
matter
of
interest
in
this
connection
that
in
the
population
of
the
district
of
columbia
was
today
it
is
the
population
of
the
city
of
washington
was
then
today
it
is
the
congress
having
provided
for
an
appropriate
national
celebration
of
the
centennial
anniversary
of
the
establishment
of
the
seat
of
the
government
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
committees
authorized
by
it
have
prepared
a
programme
for
the
th
of
december
which
date
has
been
selected
as
the
anniversary
day
deep
interest
has
been
shown
in
the
arrangements
for
the
celebration
by
the
members
of
the
committees
of
the
senate
and

of
representatives
the
committee
of

appointed
by
the
president
and
the

appointed
by
the
citizens

inhabitants
of
the
district

columbia
generally
the
programme
in
addition
to
a
reception
and
other
exercises
at

commemorative
exercises
to
be
held
jointly
by

a
reception
in

at
the
corcoran
gallery
of
art
in
honor
of
the
governors
of
the
states
and
territories
in
our
great
prosperity
we
must
guard
against
the
danger
it
invites
of
extravagance
in
government
expenditures
and
appropriations
and
the
chosen
representatives
of
the
people
will
i
doubt
not
furnish
an
example
in
their
legislation
of
that
wise
economy
which
in
a
season
of
plenty
husbands
for
the
future
in
this
era
of
great
business
activity
and
opportunity
caution
is
not
untimely
it
will
not
abate
but
strengthen
confidence
it
will
not
retard
but
promote
legitimate
industrial
and
commercial
expansion
our
growing
power
brings
with
it
temptations
and
perils
requiring
constant
vigilance
to
avoid
it
must
not
be
used
to
invite
conflicts
nor
for
oppression
but
for
the
more
effective
maintenance
of
those
principles
of
equality
and
justice
upon
which
our
institutions
and
happiness
depend
let
us
keep
always
in
mind
that
the
foundation
of
our
government
is
liberty
its
superstructure
peace

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
at
the
threshold
of
your
deliberations
you
are
called
to
mourn
with
your
countrymen
the
death
of
vicepresident
hobart
who
passed
from
this
life
on
the
morning
of
november
last
his
great
soul
now
rests
in
eternal
peace
his
private
life
was
pure
and
elevated
while
his
public
career
was
ever
distinguished
by
large
capacity
stainless
integrity
and
exalted
motives
he
has
been
removed
from
the
high
office
which
he
honored
and
dignified
but
his
lofty
character
his
devotion
to
duty
his
honesty
of
purpose
and
noble
virtues
remain
with
us
as
a
priceless
legacy
and
example
the
fiftysixth
congress
convenes
in
its
first
regular
session
with
the
country
in
a
condition
of
unusual
prosperity
of
universal
good
will
among
the
people
at
home
and
in
relations
of
peace
and
friendship
with
every
government
of
the
world
our
foreign
commerce
has
shown
great
increase
in
volume
and
value
the
combined
imports
and
exports
for
the
year
are
the
largest
ever
shown
by
a
single
year
in
all
our
history
our
exports
for
alone
exceeded
by
more
than
a
billion
dollars
our
imports
and
exports
combined
in
the
imports
per
capita
are
per
cent
less
than
in
while
the
exports
per
capita
are
per
cent
more
than
in
showing
the
enlarged
capacity
of
the
united
states
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
its
own
increasing
population
as
well
as
to
contribute
to
those
of
the
peoples
of
other
nations
exports
of
agricultural
products
were
of
manufactured
products
we
exported
in
value
being
larger
than
any
previous
year
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
the
only
years
in
all
our
history
when
the
products
of
our
manufactories
sold
abroad
exceeded
those
bought
abroad
were
and
government
receipts
from
all
sources
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
including
part
payment
of
the
central
pacific
railroad
indebtedness
aggregated
customs
receipts
were
and
those
from
internal
revenue
for
the
fiscal
year
the
expenditures
were
leaving
a
deficit
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
estimates
that
the
receipts
for
the
current
fiscal
year
will
aggregate
and
upon
the
basis
of
present
appropriations
the
expenditures
will
aggregate
leaving
a
surplus
of
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
the
internalrevenue
receipts
were
increased
about
the
present
gratifying
strength
of
the
treasury
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
on
december
the
available
cash
balance
was
of
which
was
in
gold
coin
and
bullion
the
conditions
of
confidence
which
prevail
throughout
the
country
have
brought
gold
into
more
general
use
and
customs
receipts
are
now
almost
entirely
paid
in
that
coin
the
strong
position
of
the
treasury
with
respect
to
cash
on
hand
and
the
favorable
showing
made
by
the
revenues
have
made
it
possible
for
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
take
action
under
the
provisions
of
section
revised
statutes
relating
to
the
sinking
fund
receipts
exceeded
expenditures
for
the
first
five
months
of
the
current
fiscal
year
by
and
as
mentioned
above
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
estimates
that
there
will
be
a
surplus
of
approximately
at
the
end
of
the
year
under
such
conditions
it
was
deemed
advisable
and
proper
to
resume
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
sinkingfund
law
which
for
eight
years
has
not
been
done
because
of
deficiencies
in
the
revenues
the
treasury
department
therefore
offered
to
purchase
during
november
of
the
per
cent
loan
of
or
the
per
cent
funded
loan
of
at
the
current
market
price
the
amount
offered
and
purchased
during
november
was
the
premium
paid
by
the
government
on
such
purchases
was
and
the
net
saving
in
interest
was
about
the
success
of
this
operation
was
sufficient
to
induce
the
government
to
continue
the
offer
to
purchase
bonds
to
and
including
the
d
day
of
december
instant
unless
the
remainder
of
the
called
for
should
be
presented
in
the
meantime
for
redemption
increased
activity
in
industry
with
its
welcome
attendanta
larger
employment
for
labor
at
higher
wagesgives
to
the
body
of
the
people
a
larger
power
to
absorb
the
circulating
medium
it
is
further
true
that
year
by
year
with
larger
areas
of
land
under
cultivation
the
increasing
volume
of
agricultural
products
cotton
corn
and
wheat
calls
for
a
larger
volume
of
money
supply
this
is
especially
noticeable
at
the
cropharvesting
and
cropmoving
period
in
its
earlier
history
the
national
banking
act
seemed
to
prove
a
reasonable
avenue
through
which
needful
additions
to
the
circulation
could
from
time
to
time
be
made
changing
conditions
have
apparently
rendered
it
now
inoperative
to
that
end
the
high
margin
in
bond
securities
required
resulting
from
large
premiums
which
government
bonds
command
in
the
market
or
the
tax
on
note
issues
or
both
operating
together
appear
to
be
the
influences
which
impair
its
public
utility
the
attention
of
congress
is
respectfully
invited
to
this
important
matter
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
or
not
such
reasonable
modifications
can
be
made
in
the
national
banking
act
as
will
render
its
service
in
the
particulars
here
referred
to
more
responsive
to
the
peoples
needs
i
again
urge
that
national
banks
be
authorized
to
organize
with
a
capital
of
i
urgently
recommend
that
to
support
the
existing
gold
standard
and
to
maintain
the
parity
in
value
of
the
coins
of
the
two
metals
gold
and
silver
and
the
equal
power
of
every
dollar
at
all
times
in
the
market
and
in
the
payment
of
debts
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
be
given
additional
power
and
charged
with
the
duty
to
sell
united
states
bonds
and
to
employ
such
other
effective
means
as
may
be
necessary
to
these
ends
the
authority
should
include
the
power
to
sell
bonds
on
long
and
short
time
as
conditions
may
require
and
should
provide
for
a
rate
of
interest
lower
than
that
fixed
by
the
act
of
january
while
there
is
now
no
commercial
fright
which
withdraws
gold
from
the
government
but
on
the
contrary
such
widespread
confidence
that
gold
seeks
the
treasury
demanding
paper
money
in
exchange
yet
the
very
situation
points
to
the
present
as
the
most
fitting
time
to
make
adequate
provision
to
insure
the
continuance
of
the
gold
standard
and
of
public
confidence
in
the
ability
and
purpose
of
the
government
to
meet
all
its
obligations
in
the
money
which
the
civilized
world
recognizes
as
the
best
the
financial
transactions
of
the
government
are
conducted
upon
a
gold
basis
we
receive
gold
when
we
sell
united
states
bonds
and
use
gold
for
their
payment
we
are
maintaining
the
parity
of
all
the
money
issued
or
coined
by
authority
of
the
government
we
are
doing
these
things
with
the
means
at
hand
happily
at
the
present
time
we
are
not
compelled
to
resort
to
loans
to
supply
gold
it
has
been
done
in
the
past
however
and
may
have
to
be
done
in
the
future
it
behooves
us
therefore
to
provide
at
once
the
best
means
to
meet
the
emergency
when
it
arises
and
the
best
means
are
those
which
are
the
most
certain
and
economical
those
now
authorized
have
the
virtue
neither
of
directness
nor
economy
we
have
already
eliminated
one
of
the
causes
of
our
financial
plight
and
embarrassment
during
the
years
and
our
receipts
now
equal
our
expenditures
deficient
revenues
no
longer
create
alarm
let
us
remove
the
only
remaining
cause
by
conferring
the
full
and
necessary
power
on
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
impose
upon
him
the
duty
to
uphold
the
present
gold
standard
and
preserve
the
coins
of
the
two
metals
on
a
parity
with
each
other
which
is
the
repeatedly
declared
policy
of
the
united
states
in
this
connection
i
repeat
my
former
recommendations
that
a
portion
of
the
gold
holdings
shall
be
placed
in
a
trust
fund
from
which
greenbacks
shall
be
redeemed
upon
presentation
but
when
once
redeemed
shall
not
thereafter
be
paid
out
except
for
gold
the
value
of
an
american
merchant
marine
to
the
extension
of
our
commercial
trade
and
the
strengthening
of
our
power
upon
the
sea
invites
the
immediate
action
of
the
congress
our
national
development
will
be
onesided
and
unsatisfactory
so
long
as
the
remarkable
growth
of
our
inland
industries
remains
unaccompanied
by
progress
on
the
seas
there
is
no
lack
of
constitutional
authority
for
legislation
which
shall
give
to
the
country
maritime
strength
commensurate
with
its
industrial
achievements
and
with
its
rank
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
the
past
year
has
recorded
exceptional
activity
in
our
shipyards
and
the
promises
of
continual
prosperity
in
shipbuilding
are
abundant
advanced
legislation
for
the
protection
of
our
seamen
has
been
enacted
our
coast
trade
under
regulations
wisely
framed
at
the
beginning
of
the
government
and
since
shows
results
for
the
past
fiscal
year
unequaled
in
our
records
or
those
of
any
other
power
we
shall
fail
to
realize
our
opportunities
however
if
we
complacently
regard
only
matters
at
home
and
blind
ourselves
to
the
necessity
of
securing
our
share
in
the
valuable
carrying
trade
of
the
world
last
year
american
vessels
transported
a
smaller
share
of
our
exports
and
imports
than
during
any
former
year
in
all
our
history
and
the
measure
of
our
dependence
upon
foreign
shipping
was
painfully
manifested
to
our
people
without
any
choice
of
our
own
but
from
necessity
the
departments
of
the
government
charged
with
military
and
naval
operations
in
the
east
and
west
indies
had
to
obtain
from
foreign
flags
merchant
vessels
essential
for
those
operations
the
other
great
nations
have
not
hesitated
to
adopt
the
required
means
to
develop
their
shipping
as
a
factor
in
national
defense
and
as
one
of
the
surest
and
speediest
means
of
obtaining
for
their
producers
a
share
in
foreign
markets
like
vigilance
and
effort
on
our
part
cannot
fail
to
improve
our
situation
which
is
regarded
with
humiliation
at
home
and
with
surprise
abroad
even
the
seeming
sacrifices
which
at
the
beginning
may
be
involved
will
be
offset
later
by
more
than
equivalent
gains
the
expense
is
as
nothing
compared
to
the
advantage
to
be
achieved
the
reestablishment
of
our
merchant
marine
involves
in
a
large
measure
our
continued
industrial
progress
and
the
extension
of
our
commercial
triumphs
i
am
satisfied
the
judgment
of
the
country
favors
the
policy
of
aid
to
ou
r
merchant
marine
which
will
broaden
our
commerce
and
markets
and
upbuild
our
seacarrying
capacity
for
the
products
of
agriculture
and
manufacture
which
with
the
increase
of
our
navy
mean
more
work
and
wages
to
our
countrymen
as
well
as
a
safeguard
to
american
interests
in
every
part
of
the
world
combinations
of
capital
organized
into
trusts
to
control
the
conditions
of
trade
among
our
citizens
to
stifle
competition
limit
production
and
determine
the
prices
of
products
used
and
consumed
by
the
people
are
justly
provoking
public
discussion
and
should
early
claim
the
attention
of
the
congress
the
industrial
commission
created
by
the
act
of
the
congress
of
june
has
been
engaged
in
extended
hearings
upon
the
disputed
questions
involved
in
the
subject
of
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
and
competition
they
have
not
yet
completed
their
investigation
of
this
subject
and
the
conclusions
and
recommendations
at
which
they
may
arrive
are
undetermined
the
subject
is
one
giving
rise
to
many
divergent
views
as
to
the
nature
and
variety
or
cause
and
extent
of
the
injuries
to
the
public
which
may
result
from
large
combinations
concentrating
more
or
less
numerous
enterprises
and
establishments
which
previously
to
the
formation
of
the
combination
were
carried
on
separately
it
is
universally
conceded
that
combinations
which
engross
or
control
the
market
of
any
particular
kind
of
merchandise
or
commodity
necessary
to
the
general
community
by
suppressing
natural
and
ordinary
competition
whereby
prices
are
unduly
enhanced
to
the
general
consumer
are
obnoxious
not
only
to
the
common
law
but
also
to
the
public
welfare
there
must
be
a
remedy
for
the
evils
involved
in
such
organizations
if
the
present
law
can
be
extended
more
certainly
to
control
or
check
these
monopolies
or
trusts
it
should
be
done
without
delay
whatever
power
the
congress
possesses
over
this
most
important
subject
should
be
promptly
ascertained
and
asserted
president
harrison
in
his
annual
message
of
december
says
earnest
attention
should
be
given
by
congress
to
a
consideration
of
the
question
how
far
the
restraint
of
those
combinations
of
capital
commonly
called
trusts
is
matter
of
federal
jurisdiction
when
organized
as
they
often
are
to
crush
out
all
healthy
competition
and
to
monopolize
the
production
or
sale
of
an
article
of
commerce
and
general
necessity
they
are
dangerous
conspiracies
against
the
public
good
and
should
be
made
the
subject
of
prohibitory
and
even
penal
legislation
an
act
to
protect
trade
and
commerce
against
unlawful
restraints
and
monopolies
was
passed
by
congress
on
the
d
of
july
the
provisions
of
this
statute
are
comprehensive
and
stringent
it
declares
every
contract
or
combination
in
the
form
of
a
trust
or
otherwise
or
conspiracy
in
the
restraint
of
trade
or
commerce
among
the
several
states
or
with
foreign
nations
to
be
unlawful
it
denominates
as
a
criminal
every
person
who
makes
any
such
contract
or
engages
in
any
such
combination
or
conspiracy
and
provides
a
punishment
by
fine
or
imprisonment
it
invests
the
several
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
with
jurisdiction
to
prevent
and
restrain
violations
of
the
act
and
makes
it
the
duty
of
the
several
united
states
district
attorneys
under
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general
to
institute
proceedings
in
equity
to
prevent

by
reason
of

the
united
states
without
respect
to
the
amount
in
controversy
and
to
recover
threefold
the
damages
by
him
sustained
and
the
costs
of
the
suit
including
reasonable
attorney
fees
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
act
is
aimed
at
every
kind
of
combination
in
the
nature
of
a
trust
or
monopoly
in
restraint
of
interstate
or
international
commerce
the
prosecution
by
the
united
states
of
offenses
under
the
act
of
has
been
frequently
resorted
to
in
the
federal
courts
and
notable
efforts
in
the
restraint
of
interstate
commerce
such
as
the
transmissouri
freight
association
and
the
joint
traffic
association
have
been
successfully
opposed
and
suppressed
president
cleveland
in
his
annual
message
of
december
more
than
six
years
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
this
lawafter
stating
the
evils
of
these
trust
combinations
says
though
congress
has
attempted
to
deal
with
this
matter
by
legislation
the
laws
passed
for
that
purpose
thus
far
have
proved
ineffective
not
because
of
any
lack
of
disposition
or
attempt
to
enforce
them
but
simply
because
the
laws
themselves
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
do
not
reach
the
difficulty
if
the
insufficiencies
of
existing
laws
can
be
remedied
by
further
legislation
it
should
be
done
the
fact
must
be
recognized
however
that
all
federal
legislation
on
this
subject
may
fall
short
of
its
purpose
because
of
inherent
obstacles
and
also
because
of
the
complex
character
of
our
governmental
system
which
while
making
the
federal
authority
supreme
within
its
sphere
has
carefully
limited
that
sphere
by
metes
and
bounds
which
cannot
be
transgressed
the
decision
of
our
highest
court
on
this
precise
question
renders
it
quite
doubtful
whether
the
evils
of
trusts
and
monopolies
may
be
adequately
treated
through
federal
action
unless
they
seek
directly
and
purposely
to
include
in
their
objects
transportation
or
intercourse
between
states
or
between
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries
it
does
not
follow
however
that
this
is
the
limit
of
the
remedy
that
may
be
applied
even
though
it
may
be
found
that
federal
authority
is
not
broad
enough
to
fully
reach
the
case
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
power
of
the
several
states
to
act
effectively
in
the
premises
and
there
should
be
no
reason
to
doubt
their
willingness
to
judiciously
exercise
such
power
the
state
legislation
to
which
president
cleveland
looked
for
relief
from
the
evils
of
trusts
has
failed
to
accomplish
fully
that
object
this
is
probably
due
to
a
great
extent
to
the
fact
that
different
states
take
different
views
as
to
the
proper
way
to
discriminate
between
evil
and
injurious
combinations
and
those
associations
which
are
beneficial
and
necessary
to
the
business
prosperity
of
the
country
the
great
diversity
of
treatment
in
different
states
arising
from
this
cause
and
the
intimate
relations
of
all
parts
of
the
country
to
each
other
without
regarding
state
lines
in
the
conduct
of
business
have
made
the
enforcement
of
state
laws
difficult
it
is
apparent
that
uniformity
of
legislation
upon
this
subject
in
the
several
states
is
much
to
be
desired
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
such
uniformity
founded
in
a
wise
and
just
discrimination
between
what
is
injurious
and
what
is
useful
and
necessary
in
business
operations
may
be
obtained
and
that
means
may
be
found
for
the
congress
within
the
limitations
of
its
constitutional
power
so
to
supplement
an
effective
code
of
state
legislation
as
to
make
a
complete
system
of
laws
throughout
the
united
states
adequate
to
compel
a
general
observance
of
the
salutary
rules
to
which
i
have
referred
the
whole
question
is
so
important
and
farreaching
that
i
am
sure
no
part
of
it
will
be
lightly
considered
but
every
phase
of
it
will
have
the
studied
deliberation
of
the
congress
resulting
in
wise
and
judicious
action
a
review
of
our
relations
with
foreign
states
is
presented
with
such
recommendations
as
are
deemed
appropriate
the
longpending
boundary
dispute
between
the
argentine
republic
and
chile
was
settled
in
march
last
by
the
award
of
an
arbitral
commission
on
which
the
united
states
minister
at
buenos
ayres
served
as
umpire
progress
has
been
made
toward
the
conclusion
of
a
convention
of
extradition
with
the
argentine
republic
having
been
advised
and
consented
to
by
the
united
states
senate
and
ratified
by
argentina
it
only
awaits
the
adjustment
of
some
slight
changes
in
the
text
before
exchange
in
my
last
annual
message
i
adverted
to
the
claim
of
the
austrohungarian
government
for
indemnity
for
the
killing
of
certain
austrian
and
hungarian
subjects
by
the
authorities
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
at
lattimer
while
suppressing
an
unlawful
tumult
of
miners
september
in
view
of
the
verdict
of
acquittal
rendered
by
the
court
before
which
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
were
tried
for
murder
and
following
the
established
doctrine
that
the
government
may
not
be
held
accountable
for
injuries
suffered
by
individuals
at
the
hands
of
the
public
authorities
while
acting
in
the
line
of
duty
in
suppressing
disturbance
of
the
public
peace
this
government
after
due
consideration
of
the
claim
advanced
by
the
austrohungarian
government
was
constrained
to
decline
liability
to
indemnify
the
sufferers
it
is
gratifying
to
be
able
to
announce
that
the
belgian
government
has
mitigated
the
restrictions
on
the
importation
of
cattle
from
the
united
states
to
which
i
referred
in
my
last
annual
message
having
been
invited
by
belgium
to
participate
in
a
congress
held
at
brussels
to
revise
the
provisions
of
the
general
act
of
july
for
the
repression
of
the
african
slave
trade
to
which
the
united
states
was
a
signatory
party
this
government
preferred
not
to
be
represented
by
a
plenipotentiary
but
reserved
the
right
of
accession
to
the
result
notable
changes
were
made
those
especially
concerning
this
country
being
in
the
line
of
the
increased
restriction
of
the
deleterious
trade
in
spirituous
liquors
with
the
native
tribes
which
this
government
has
from
the
outset
urgently
advocated
the
amended
general
act
will
be
laid
before
the
senate
with
a
view
to
its
advice
and
consent
early
in
the
year
the
peace
of
bolivia
was
disturbed
by
a
successful
insurrection
the
united
states
minister
remained
at
his
post
attending
to
the
american
interests
in
that
quarter
and
using
besides
his
good
offices
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
british
subjects
in
the
absence
of
their
national
representative
on
the
establishment
of
the
new
government
our
minister
was
directed
to
enter
into
re
lations
therewith
general
pando
was
elected
president
of
bolivia
on
october
our
representative
has
been
instructed
to
use
all
permissible
friendly
endeavors
to
induce
the
government
of
bolivia
to
amend
its
marriage
laws
so
as
to
give
legal
status
to
the
noncatholic
and
civil
marriages
of
aliens
within
its
jurisdiction
and
strong
hopes
are
entertained
that
the
bolivian
law
in
this
regard
will
be
brought
as
was
that
of
peru
some
years
ago
into
harmony
with
the
general
practice
of
modern
states
a
convention
of
extradition
with
brazil
signed
may
has
been
ratified
by
the
brazilian
legislature
during
the
past
summer
two
national
ships
of
the
united
states
have
visited
brazilian
ports
on
a
friendly
mission
and
been
cordially
received
the
voyage
of
the
wilmington
up
the
amazon
river
gave
rise
to
a
passing
misunderstanding
owing
to
confusion
in
obtaining
permission
to
visit
the
interior
and
make
surveys
in
the
general
interest
of
navigation
but
the
incident
found
a
ready
adjustment
in
harmony
with
the
close
relations
of
amity
which
this
government
has
always
sedulously
sought
to
cultivate
with
the
commonwealths
of
the
western
continent
the
claim
growing
out
of
the
seizure
of
the
americanowned
newspaper
the
panama
star
and
herald
by
the
authorities
of
colombia
has
been
settled
after
a
controversy
of
several
years
by
an
agreement
assessing
at
the
indemnity
to
be
paid
by
the
colombian
government
in
three
installments
of
each
the
good
will
of
colombia
toward
our
country
has
been
testified
anew
by
the
cordial
extension
of
facilities
to
the
nicaraguan
canal
commission
in
their
approaching
investigation
of
the
panama
canal
and
other
projected
routes
across
the
isthmus
of
darien
toward
the
end
of
october
an
insurrectionary
disturbance
developed
in
the
colombian
republic
this
movement
has
thus
far
not
attained
any
decisive
result
and
is
still
in
progress
discussion
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
action
of
denmark
in
imposing
restrictions
on
the
importation
of
american
meats
has
continued
without
substantial
result
in
our
favor
the
neighboring
island
republic
of
santo
domingo
has
lately
been
the
scene
of
revolution
following
a
long
period
of
tranquility
it
began
with
the
killing
of
president
heureaux
in
july
last
and
culminated
in
the
relinquishment
by
the
succeeding
vicepresident
of
the
reins
of
government
to
the
insurgents
the
first
act
of
the
provisional
government
was
the
calling
of
a
presidential
and
constituent
election
juan

having
been

was
inaugurated
on
the
th
of

have
been
entered
into
with
the
newly
established
government
the
experimental
association
of
nicaragua
honduras
and
salvador
tinder
the
title
of
the
greater
republic
of
central
america
when
apparently
on
the
threshold
of
a
complete
federal
organization
by
the
adoption
of
a
constitution
and
the
formation
of
a
national
legislature
was
disrupted
in
the
last
days
of
november
by
the
withdrawal
of
salvador
thereupon
nicaragua
and
honduras
abandoned
the
joint
compact
each
resuming
its
former
independent
sovereignty
this
was
followed
by
the
reception
of
minister
merry
by
the
republics
of
nicaragua
and
salvador
while
minister
hunter
in
turn
presented
his
credentials
to
the
government
of
honduras
thus
reverting
to
the
old
distribution
of
the
diplomatic
agencies
of
the
united
states
in
central
america
for
which
our
existing
statutes
provide
a
nicaraguan
envoy
has
been
accredited
to
the
united
states
an
insurrectionary
movement
under
general
reyes
broke
out
at
bluefields
in
february
last
and
for
a
time
exercised
actual
control
in
the
mosquito
territory
the
detroit
was
promptly
sent
thither
for
the
protection
of
american
interests
after
a
few
weeks
the
reyes
government
renounced
the
conflict
giving
place
to
the
restored
supremacy
of
nicaragua
during
the
interregnum
certain
public
dues
accruing
under
nicaraguan
law
were
collected
from
american
merchants
by
the
authorities
for
the
time
being
in
effective
administrative
control
upon
the
titular
government
regaining
power
a
second
payment
of
these
dues
was
demanded
controversy
arose
touching
the
validity
of
the
original
payment
of
the
debt
to
the
de
facto
regent
of
the
territory
an
arrangement
was
effected
in
april
last
by
the
united
states
minister
and
the
foreign
secretary
of
nicaragua
whereby
the
amounts
of
the
duplicate
payments
were
deposited
with
the
british
consul
pending
an
adjustment
of
the
matter
by
direct
agreement
between
the
governments
of
the
united
states
and
nicaragua
the
controversy
is
still
unsettled
the
contract
of
the
maritime
canal
company
of
nicaragua
was
declared
forfeited
by
the
nicaraguan
government
on
the
tenth
of
october
on
the
ground
of
nonfulfillment
within
the
ten
years
term
stipulated
in
the
contract
the
maritime
canal
company
has
lodged
a
protest
against
this
action
alleging
rights
in
the
premises
which
appear
worthy
of
consideration
this
government
expects
that
nicaragua
will
afford
the
protestants
a
full
and
fair
hearing
upon
the
merits
of
the
case
the
nicaragua
canal
commission
which
had
been
engaged
upon
the
work
of
examination
and
survey
for
a
shipcanal
route
across
nicaragua
having
completed
its
labors
and
made
its
report
was
dissolved
on
may
p
and
on
june
to
a
new
commission
known
as
the
isthmian
canal
commission
was
organized
under
the
terms
of
the
act
approved
march
for
the
purpose
of
examining
the
american
isthmus
with
a
view
to
determining
the
most
practicable
and
feasible
route
for
a
ship
canal
across
that
isthmus
with
its
probable
cost
and
other
essential
details
this
commission
under
the
presidency
of
rearadmiral
john
g
walker
u
s
n
retired
entered
promptly
upon
the
work
intrusted
to
it
and
is
now
carrying
on
examinations
in
nicaragua
along
the
route
of
the
panama
canal
and
in
darien
from
the
atlantic
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
atrato
river
to
the
bay
of
panama
on
the
pacific
side
good
progress
has
been
made
but
under
the
law
a
comprehensive
and
complete
investigation
is
called
for
which
will
require
much
labor
and
considerable
time
for
its
accomplishment
the
work
will
be
prosecuted
as
expeditiously
as
possible
and
a
report
made
at
the
earliest
practicable
date
the
great
importance
of
this
work
cannot
be
too
often
or
too
strongly
pressed
upon
the
attention
of
the
congress
in
my
message
of
a
year
ago
i
expressed
my
views
of
the
necessity
of
a
canal
which
would
link
the
two
great
oceans
to
which
i
again
invite
your
consideration
the
reasons
then
presented
for
early
action
are
even
stronger
now
a
pleasing
incident
in
the
relations
of
this
government
with
that
of
chile
occurred
in
the
generous
assistance
given
to
the
war
ship
newark
when
in
distress
in
chilean
waters
not
alone
in
this
way
has
the
friendly
disposition
of
chile
found
expression
that
country
has
acceded
to
the
convention
for
the
establishment
of
the
bureau
of
the
american
republics
in
which
organization
every
independent
state
of
the
continent
now
shares
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of
a
convention
for
the
revival
of
the
united
states
and
chilean
claims
commission
and
for
the
adjudication
of
claims
heretofore
presented
but
not
determined
during
the
life
of
the
previous
commission
has
been
delayed
by
reason
of
the
necessity
for
fresh
action
by
the
chilean
senate
upon
the
amendments
attached
to
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
by
the
united
states
senate
this
formality
is
soon
to
be
accomplished
in
view
of
disturbances
in
the
populous
provinces
of
northern
china
where
are
many
of
our
citizens
and
of
the
imminence
of
disorder
near
the
capital
and
toward
the
seaboard
a
guard
of
marines
was
landed
from
the
boston
and
stationed
during
last
winter
in
the
legation
compound
at
peking
with
the
restoration
of
order
this
protection
was
withdrawn
the
interests
of
our
citizens
in
that
vast
empire
have
not
been
neglected
during
the
past
year
adequate
protection
has
been
secured
for
our
missionaries
and
some
injuries
to
their
property
have
been
redressed
american
capital
has
sought
and
found
various
opportunities
of
competing
to
carry
out
the
internal
improvements
which
the
imperial
government
is
wisely
encouraging
and
to
develop
the
natural
resources
of
the
empire
our
trade
with
china
has
continued
to
grow
and
our
commercial
rights
under
existing
treaties
have
been
everywhere
maintained
during
the
past
year
as
they
will
be
in
the
future
the
extension
of
the
area
open
to
international
foreign
settlement
at
shanghai
and
the
opening
of
the
ports
of
nanking
tsingtao
kiao
chao
and
talienwan
to
foreign
trade
and
settlement
will
doubtless
afford
american
enterprise
additional
facilities
and
new
fields
of
which
it
will
not
be
slow
to
take
advantage
in
my
message
to
congress
of
december
i
urged
that
the
recommendation
which
had
been
made
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
the
th
of
june
for
an
appropriation
for
a
commission
to
study
the
commercial
and
industrial
conditions
in
the
chinese
empire
and
report
as
to
the
opportunities
for
and
obstacles
to
the
enlargement
of
markets
in
china
for
the
raw
products
and
manufactures
of
the
united
states
should
receive
at
your
hands
the
consideration
which
its
importance
and
timeliness
merited
but
the
congress
failed
to
take
action
i
now
renew
this
recommendation
as
the
importance
of
the
subject
has
steadily
grown
since
it
was
first
submitted
to
you
and
no
time
should
be
lost
in
studying
for
ourselves
the
resources
of
this
great
field
for
american
trade
and
enterprise
the
death
of
president
faure
in
february
last
called
forth
those
sincere
expressions
of
sympathy
which
befit
the
relations
of
two
republics
as
closely
allied
by
unbroken
historic
ties
as
are
the
united
states
and
france
preparations
for
the
representation
of
the
industries
arts
and
products
of
the
united
states
at
the
worlds
exposition
to
be
held
in
paris
next
year
continue
on
an
elaborate
and
comprehensive
scale
thanks
to
the
generous
appropriation
provided
by
congress
and
to
the
friendly
interest
the
french
government
has
shown
in
furthering
a

typical
exhibit
of
american
progress
there
has
been
allotted
to
the
united
states
a
considerable
addition
of
space
which
while
placing
our
country
in
the
first
rant
among
exhibitors
does
not
suffice
to
meet
the
increasingly
urgent
demands
of
our
manufacturers
the
efforts
of
the
commissioner
general
are
ably
directed
toward
a
strictly
representative
display
of
all
that
most
characteristically
marks
american
achievement
in
the
inventive
arts
and
most
adequately
shows
the
excellence
of
our
natural
productions
in
this
age
of
keen
rivalry
among
nations
for
mastery
in
commerce
the
doctrine
of
evolution
and
the
rule
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
must
be
as
inexorable
in
their
operation
as
they
are
positive
in
the
results
they
bring
about
the
place
won
in
the
struggle
by
an
industrial
people
can
only
be
held
by
unrelaxed
endeavor
and
constant
advance
in
achievement
the
present
extraordinary
impetus
in
every
line
of
american
exportation
and
the
astounding
increase
in
the
volume
and
value
of
our
share
in
the
worlds
markets
may
not
be
attributed
to
accidental
conditions
the
reasons
are
not
far
to
seek
they
lie
deep
in
our
national
character
and
find
expression
year
by
year
in
every
branch
of
handicraft
in
every
new
device
whereby
the
materials
we
so
abundantly
produce
are
subdued
to
the
artisans
will
and
made
to
yield
the
largest
most
practical
and
most
beneficial
return
the
american
exhibit
at
paris
should
and
i
am
confident
will
be
an
open
volume
whose
lessons
of
skillfully
directed
endeavor
unfaltering
energy
and
consummate
performance
may
be
read
by
all
on
every
page
thus
spreading
abroad
a
clearer
knowledge
of
the
worth
of
our
productions
and
the
justice
of
our
claim
to
an
important
place
in
the
marts
of
the
world
to
accomplish
this
by
judicious
selection
by
recognition
of
paramount
merit
in
whatever
walk
of
trade
or
manufacture
it
may
appear
and
by
orderly
classification
and
attractive
installation
is
the
task
of
our
commission
the
united
states
government
building
is
approaching
completion
and
no
effort
will
be
spared
to
make
it
worthy
in
beauty
of
architectural
plan
and
in
completeness
of
display
to
represent
our
nation
it
has
been
suggested
that
a
permanent
building
of
similar
or
appropriate
design
be
erected
on
a
convenient
site
already
given
by
the
municipality
near
the
exposition
grounds
to
serve
in
commemoration
of
the
part
taken
by
this
country
in
this
great
enterprise
as
an
american
national
institute
for
our
countrymen
resorting
to
paris
for
study
i
am
informed
by
our
commissionergeneral
that
we
shall
have
in
the
american
sections
at
paris
over
exhibitors
from
every
state
ill
our
country
a
number
ten
times
as
great
as
those
which
were
represented
at
vienna
in
six
times
as
many
as
those
in
paris
in
and
four
times
as
many
as
those
who
exhibited
in
paris
in
this
statement
does
not
include
the
exhibits
from
either
cuba
puerto
rico
or
hawaii
for
which
arrangements
have
been
made
a
number
of
important
international
congresses
on
special
topics
affecting
public
interests
are
proposed
to
be
held
in
paris
next
summer
in
connection
with
the
exposition
effort
will
be
made
to
have
the
several
technical
branches
of
our
administration
efficiently
represented
at
those
conferences
each
in
its
special
line
and
to
procure
the
largest
possible
concourse
of
state
representatives
particularly
at
the
congresses
of
public
charity
and
medicine
our
relations
with
germany
continue
to
be
most
cordial
the
increasing
intimacy
of
direct
association
has
been
marked
during
the
year
by
the
granting
permission
in
april
for
the
landing
on
our
shores
of
a
cable
from
borkum
emden
on
the
north
sea
by
way
of
the
azores
and
also
by
the
conclusion
on
september
of
a
parcels
post
convention
with
the
german
empire
in
all
that
promises
closer
relations
of
intercourse
and
commerce
and
a
better
understanding
between
two
races
having
so
many
traits
in
common
germany
can
be
assured
of
the
most
cordial
cooperation
of
this
government
and
people
we
may
be
rivals
in
many
material
paths
but
our
rivalry
should
be
generous
and
open
ever
aiming
toward
the
attainment
of
larger
results
and
the
mutually
beneficial
advancement
of
each
in
the
line
of
its
especial
adaptabilities
the
several
governments
of
the
empire
seem
reluctant
to
admit
the
natural
excellence
of
our
food
productions
and
to
accept
the
evidence
we
constantly
tender
of
the
care
with
which
their
purity
is
guarded
by
rigid
inspection
from
the
farm
through
the
slaughterhouse
and
the
packing
establishments
to
the
port
of
shipment
our
system
of
control
over
exported
food
staples
invites
examination
from
any
quarter
and
challenges
respect
by
its
efficient
thoroughness
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
in
time
the
two
governments
will
act
in
common
accord
toward
the
realization
of
their
common
purpose
to
safeguard
the
public
health
and
to
insure
the
purity
and
wholesomeness
of
all
food
products
imported
by
either
country
from
the
other
were
the
congress
to
authorize
an
invitation
to
germany
in
connection
with
the
pending
reciprocity
negotiations
for
the
constitution
of
a
joint
commission
of
scientific
experts
and
practical
men
of
affairs
to
conduct
a
searching
investigation
of
food
production
and
exportation
in
both
countries
and
report
to
their
respective
legislatures
for
the
adoption
of
such
remedial
measures
as
they
might
recommend
for
either
the
way
might
be
opened
for
the
desirable
result
indicated
efforts
to
obtain
for
american
life
insurance
companies
a
full
hearing
as
to
their
business
operations
in
prussia
have
after
several
years
of
patient
representation
happily
succeeded
and
one
of
the
most
important
american
companies
has
been
granted
a
concession
to
continue
business
in
that
kingdom
i
am
also
glad
to
announce
that
the
german
insurance
companies
have
been
readmitted
by
the
superintendent
of
insurance
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
new
york
subsequent
to
the
exchange
of
our
peace
treaty
with
spain
germany
acquired
the
caroline
islands
by
purchase
paying
therefore
assurances
have
been
received
from
the
german
government
that
the
rights
of
american
missionaries
and
traders
there
will
be
considerately
observed
in
my
last
annual
message
i
referred
to
the
pending
negotiations
with
great
britain
in
respect
to
the
dominion
of
canada
by
means
of
an
executive
agreement
a
joint
high
commission
had
been
created
for
the
purpose
of
adjusting
all
unsettled
questions
between
the
united
states
and
canada
embracing
twelve
subjects
among
which
were
the
questions
of
the
fur
seals
the
fisheries
of
the
coast
and
contiguous
inland
waters
the
alaskan
boundary
the
transit
of
merchandise
in
bond
the
alien
labor
laws
mining
rights
reciprocity
in
trade
revision
of
the
agreement
respecting
naval
vessels
in
the
great
lakes
a
more
complete
marking
of
parts
of
the
boundary
provision
for
the
conveyance
of
criminals
and
for
wrecking
and
salvage
much
progress
had
been
made
by
the
commission
toward
the
adjustment
of
many
of
these
questions
when
it
became
apparent
that
an
irreconcilable
difference
of
views
was
entertained
respecting
the
delimitation
of
the
alaskan
boundary
in
the
failure
of
an
agreement
as
to
the
meaning
of
articles
iii
and
iv
of
the
treaty
of
between
russia
and
great
britain
which
defined
the
boundary
between
alaska
and
canada
the
american
commissioners
proposed
that
the
subject
of
the
boundary
be
laid
aside
and
that
the
remaining
questions
of
difference
be
proceeded
with
some
of
which
were
so
far
advanced
as
to
assure
the
probability
of
a
settlement
this
being
declined
by
the
british
commissioners
an
adjournment
was
taken
until
the
boundary
should
be
adjusted
by
the
two
governments
the
subject
has
been
receiving
the
careful
attention
which
its
importance
demands
with
the
result
that
a
modus
vivendi
for
provisional
demarcations
in
the
region
about
the
head
of
lynn
canal
has
been
agreed
upon
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
negotiations
now
in
progress
between
the
two
governments
will
end
in
an
agreement
for
the
establishment
and
delimitation
of
a
permanent
boundary
apart
from
these
questions
growing
out
of
our
relationship
with
our
northern
neighbor
the
most
friendly
disposition
and
ready
agreement
have
marked
the
discussion
of
numerous
matters
arising
in
the
vast
and
intimate
intercourse
of
the
united
states
with
great
britain
this
government
has
maintained
an
attitude
of
neutrality
in
the
unfortunate
contest
between
great
britain
and
the
boer
states
of
africa
we
have
remained
faithful
to
the
precept
of
avoiding
entangling
alliances
as
to
affairs
not
of
our
direct
concern
had
circumstances
suggested
that
the
parties
to
the
quarrel
would
have
welcomed
any
kindly
expression
of
the
hope
of
the
american
people
that
war
might
be
averted
good
offices
would
have
been
gladly
tendered
the
united
states
representative
at
pretoria
was
early
instructed
to
see
that
all
neutral
american
interests
be
respected
by
the
combatants
this
has
been
an
easy
task
in
view
of
the
positive
declarations
of
both
british
and
boer
authorities
that
the
personal
and
property
rights
of
our
citizens
should
be
observed
upon
the
withdrawal
of
the
british
agent
from
pretoria
the
united
states
consul
was
authorized
upon
the
request
of
the
british
government
and
with
the
assent
of
the
south
african
and
orange
free
state
governments
to
exercise
the
customary
good
offices
of
a
neutral
for
the
care
of
british
interests
in
the
discharge
of
this
function
i
am
happy
to
say
that
abundant
opportunity
has
been
afforded
to
show
the
impartiality
of
this
government
toward
both
the
combatants
for
the
fourth
time
in
the
present
decade
question
has
arisen
with
the
government
of
italy
in
regard
to
the
lynching
of
italian
subjects
the
latest
of
these
deplorable
events
occurred
at
tallulah
louisiana
whereby
five
unfortunates
of
italian
origin
were
taken
from
jail
and
hanged
the
authorities
of
the
state
and
a
representative
of
the
italian
embassy
having
separately
investigated
the
occurrence
with
discrepant
results
particularly
as
to
the
alleged
citizenship
of
the
victims
and
it
not
ap
pearing
that
the
state
had
been
able
to
discover
and
punish
the
violators
of
the
law
an
independent
investigation
has
been
set
on
foot
through
the
agency
of
the
department
of
state
and
is
still
in
progress
the
result
will
enable
the
executive
to
treat
the
question
with
the
government
of
italy
in
a
spirit
of
fairness
and
justice
a
satisfactory
solution
will
doubtless
be
reached
the
recurrence
of
these
distressing
manifestations
of
blind
mob
fury
directed
at
dependents
or
natives
of
a
foreign
country
suggests
that
the
contingency
has
arisen
for
action
by
congress
in
the
direction
of
conferring
upon
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
in
this
class
of
international
cases
where
the
ultimate
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
may
be
involved
the
suggestion
is
not
new
in
his
annual
message
of
december
my
predecessor
president
harrison
said
it
would
i
believe
be
entirely
competent
for
congress
to
make
offenses
against
the
treaty
rights
of
foreigners
domiciled
in
the
united
states
cognizable
in
the
federal
courts
this
has
not
however
been
done
and
the
federal
officers
and
courts
have
no
power
in
such
cases
to
intervene
either
for
the
protection
of
a
foreign
citizen
or
for
the
punishment
of
his
slayers
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
in
this
state
of
the
law
that
the
officers
of
the
state
charged
with
police
and
judicial
powers
in
such
cases
must
in
the
consideration
of
international
questions
growing
out
of
such
incidents
be
regarded
in
such
sense
as
federal
agents
as
to
make
this
government
answerable
for
their
acts
in
cases
where
it
would
be
answerable
if
the
united
states
had
used
its
constitutional
power
to
define
and
punish
crimes
against
treaty
rights
a
bill
to
provide
for
the
punishment
of
violations
of
treaty
rights
of
aliens
was
introduced
in
the
senate
march
and
reported
favorably
march
having
doubtless
in
view
the
language
of
that
part
of
article
iii
of
the
treaty
of
february
between
the
united
states
and
italy
which
stipulates
that
the
citizens
of
each
of
the
high
contracting
parties
shall
receive
in
the
states
and
territories
of
the
other
most
constant
protection
and
security
for
their
persons
and
property
and
shall
enjoy
in
this
respect
the
same
rights
and
privileges
as
are
or
shall
be
granted
to
the
natives
on
their
submitting
themselves
to
the
conditions
imposed
upon
the
natives
the
bill
so
introduced
and
reported
provided
that
any
act
committed
in
any
state
or
territory
of
the
united
states
in
violation
of
the
rights
of
a
citizen
or
subject
of
a
foreign
country
secured
to
such
citizen
or
subject
by
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
such
foreign
country
and
constituting
a
crime
under
the
laws
of
the
state
or
territory
shall
constitute
a
like
crime
against
the
united
states
and
be
cognizable
in
the
federal
courts
no
action
was
taken
by
congress
in
the
matter
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
subject
be
taken
up
anew
and
acted
upon
during
the
present
session
the
necessity
for
some
such
provision
abundantly
appears
precedent
for
constituting
a
federal
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases
where
aliens
are
sufferers
is
rationally
deducible
from
the
existing
statute
which
gives
to
the
district
and
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
jurisdiction
of
civil
suits
brought
by
aliens
where
the
amount
involved
exceeds
a
certain
sum
if
such
jealous
solicitude
be
shown
for
alien
rights
in
cases
of
merely
civil
and
pecuniary
import
how
much
greater
should
be
the
public
duty
to
take
cognizance
of
matters
affecting
the
lives
and
the
rights
of
aliens
tinder
the
settled
principles
of
international
law
no
less
than
under
treaty
stipulation
in
cases
of
such
transcendent
wrongdoing
as
mob
murder
especially
when
experience
has
shown
that
local
justice
is
too
often
helpless
to
punish
the
offenders
after
many
years
of
endeavor
on
the
part
of
this
government
to
that
end
the
italian
government
has
consented
to
enter
into
negotiations
for
a
naturalization
convention
having
for
one
of
its
objects
the
regulation
of
the
status
of
italians
except
those
of
an
age
for
active
military
service
who
having
been
naturalized
in
the
united
states
may
revisit
italy
it
is
hoped
that
with
the
mutually
conciliatory
spirit
displayed
a
successful
conclusion
will
be
reached
the
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
between
the
united
states
and
japan
on
november
took
effect
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
its
xixth
article
on
the
th
of
july
last
simultaneously
with
the
enforcement
of
like
treaties
with
the
other
powers
except
france
whose
convention
did
not
go
into
operation
until
august
the
united
states
being
however
granted
up
to
that
date
all
the
privileges
and
rights
accorded
to
french
citizens
under
the
old
french
treaty
by
this
notable
conventional
reform
japans
position
as
a
fully
independent
sovereign
power
is
assured
control
being
gained
of
taxation
customs

judicial
administration
coasting

all
other
domestic

on
the
part
of

a
circumstance
which
attests
the
ripe

constant
increase
in
the

of
our
relations
with

and
in
the
magnitude
of
mutually

interchanges
this

has
omitted
no
opportunity
to
show
its
strong
desire
to
develop
and
perpetuate
the
ties
of
cordiality
now
so
long
happily
unbroken
following
the
termination
on

by

of
the
convention

extradition
of

a

thus
far
has
been
effective
and
satisfactory
a
recent

has
served
to

the
application
of

that

committed
in

was
after
mature
consideration
directed
by

in
the
conviction
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
thereby
subserved
similar
action
on
appropriate
occasion
by
the
mexican
executive
will
not
only
tend
to
accomplish
the
desire
of
both
governments
that
grave
crimes
go
not
unpunished
but
also
to
repress
lawlessness
along
the
border
of
the
two

stipulates
that
neither
government
shall
assume
jurisdiction
in
the
punishment
of
crimes
committed
exclusively
within
the
territory
of
the
other
this
will
obviate
in

the
embarrassing
controversies
which
have
heretofore
arisen

assertion

try
and
punish

affords
proof

which
her
plenipotentiaries
conspicuously
favored
at
the

conference
when

advocated
by

a
suggestion
for
a
permanent
exposition
of
our
products
and
manufactures
in
russia
although
not
yet
fully
shaped
has
been
so
cordially
welcomed
by

not
inaptly
take
a
fitting
place

legislation

looking

important
events
have
occurred
in
the
samoan
islands
the
election
according
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
samoa
of
a
successor
to
the
late
king
malietoa
laupepa
developed
a
contest
as
to
the
validity
of
the
result
which
issue
by
the
terms
of
the
general
act
was
to
be
decided
by
the
chief
justice
upon
his
rendering
a
judgment
in
favor
of
malietoa
tanu
the
rival
chief
mataafa
took
up
arms
the
active
intervention
of
american
and
british
war
ships
became
imperative
to
restore
order
at
the
cost
of
sanguinary
encounters
in
this
emergency
a
joint
commission
of
representatives
of
the
united
states
germany
and
great
britain
was
sent
to
samoa
to
investigate
the
situation
and
provide
a
temporary
remedy
by
its
active
efforts
a
peaceful
solution
was
reached
for
the
time
being
the
kingship
being
abolished
and
a
provisional
government
established
recommendations
unanimously
made
by
the
commission
for
a
permanent
adjustment
of
the
samoan
question
were
taken
under
consideration
by
the
three
powers
parties
to
the
general
act
but
the
more
they
were
examined
the
more
evident
it
became
that
a
radical
change
was
necessary
in
the
relations
of
the
powers
to
samoa
the
inconveniences
and
possible
perils
of
the
tripartite
scheme
of
supervision
and
control
in
the
samoan
group
by
powers
having
little
interest
in
common
in
that
quarter
beyond
commercial
rivalry
had
been
once
more
emphasized
by
the
recent
events
the
suggested
remedy
of
the
joint
commission
like
the
scheme
it
aimed
to
replace
amounted
to
what
has
been
styled
a
tridominium
being
the
exercise
of
the
functions
of
sovereignty
by
an
unanimous
agreement
of
three
powers
the
situation
had
become
far
more
intricate
and
embarrassing
from
every
point
of
view
than
it
was
when
my
predecessor
in
summed
up
its
perplexities
and
condemned
the
participation
in
it
of
the
united
states
the
arrangement
under
which
samoa
was
administered
had
proved
impracticable
and
unacceptable
to
all
the
powers
concerned
to
withdraw
from
the
agreement
and
abandon
the
islands
to
germany
and
great
britain
would
not
be
compatible
with
our
interests
in
the
archipelago
to
relinquish
our
rights
in
the
harbor
of
pago
pago
the
best
anchorage
in
the
pacific
the
occupancy
of
which
had
been
leased
to
the
united
states
in
by
the
first
foreign
treaty
ever
concluded
by
samoa
was
not
to
be
thought
of
either
as
regards
the
needs
of
our
navy
or
the
interests
of
our
growing
commerce
with
the
east
we
could
not
have
considered
any
proposition
for
the
abrogation
of
the
tripartite
control
which
did
not
confirm
us
in
all
our
rights
and
safeguard
all
our
national
interests
in
the
islands
our
views
commended
themselves
to
the
other
powers
a
satisfactory
arrangement
was
concluded
between
the
governments
of
germany
and
of
england
by
virtue
of
which
england
retired
from
samoa
in
view
of
compensations
in
other
directions
and
both
powers
renounced
in
favor
of
the
united
states
all
their
rights
and
claims
over
and
in
respect
to
that
portion
of
the
group
lying
to
the
east
of
the
one
hundred
and
seventyfirst
degree
of
west
longitude
embracing
the
islands
of
tutuila
ofoo
olosenga
and
manua
i
transmit
to
the
senate
for
its
constitutional
action
thereon
a
convention
which
besides
the
provisions
above
mentioned
also
guarantees
us
the
same
privileges
and
conditions
in
respect
to
commerce
and
commercial
vessels
in
all
of
the
islands
of
samoa
as
those
possessed
by
germany
claims
have
been
preferred
by
white
residents
of
samoa
on
account
of
injuries
alleged
to
have
been
suffered
through
the
acts
of
the
treaty
governments
in
putting
down
the
late
disturbances
a
convention
has
been
made
between
the
three
powers
for
the
investigation
and
settlement
of
these
claims
by
a
neutral
arbitrator
to
which
the
attention
of
the
senate
will
be
invited
my
annual
message
of
last
year
was
necessarily
devoted
in
great
part
to
a
consideration
of
the
spanish
war
and
of
the
results
it
wrought
and
the
conditions
it
imposed
for
the
future
i
am
gratified
to
announce
that
the
treaty
of
peace
has
restored
friendly
relations
between
the
two
powers
effect
has
been
given
to
its
most
important
provisions
the
evacuation
of
puerto
rico
having
already
been
accomplished
on
the
xivth
of
october
nothing
remained
necessary
there
but
to
continue
the
provisional
military
control
of
the
island
until
the
congress
should
enact
a
suitable
government
for
the
ceded
territory
of
the
character
and
scope
of
the
measures
to
that
end
i
shall
treat
in
another
part
of
this
message
the
withdrawal
of
the
authority
of
spain
from
the
island
of
cuba
was
effected
by
the
st
of
january
so
that
the
full
reestablishment
of
peace
found
the
relinquished
territory
held
by
us
in
trust
for
the
inhabitants
maintaining
under
the
direction
of
the
executive
such
government
and
control
therein
as
should
conserve
public
order
restore
the
productive
conditions
of
peace
so
long
disturbed
by
the
instability
and
disorder
which
prevailed
for
the
greater
part
of
the
preceding
three
decades
and
build
up
that
tranquil
development
of
the
domestic
state
whereby
alone
can
be
realized
the
high
purpose
as
proclaimed
in
the
joint
resolution
adopted
by
the
congress
on
the
th
of
april
by
which
the
united
states
disclaimed
any
disposition
or
intention
to
exercise
sovereignty
jurisdiction
or
control
over
cuba
except
for
the
pacification
thereof
and
asserted
its
determination
when
that
was
accomplished
to
leave
the
government
and
control
of
the
island
to
its
people
the
pledge
contained
in
this
resolution
is
of
the
highest
honorable
obligation
and
must
be
sacredly
kept
i
believe
that
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
this
direction
all
the
administrative
measures
adopted
in
cuba
have
aimed
to
fit
it
for
a
regenerated
existence
by
enforcing
the
supremacy
of
law
and
justice
by
placing
wherever
practicable
the
machinery
of
administration
in
the
hands
of
the
inhabitants
by
instituting
needed
sanitary
reforms
by
spreading
education
by
fostering
industry
and
trade
by
inculcating
public
morality
and
in
short
by
taking
every
rational
step
to
aid
the
cuban
people
to
attain
to
that
plane
of
selfconscious
respect
and
selfreliant
unity
which
fits
an
enlightened
community
for
selfgovernment
within
its
own
sphere
while
enabling
it
to
fulfill
all
outward
obligation
this
nation
has
assumed
before
the
world
a
grave
responsibility
for
the
future
good
government
of
cuba
we
have
accepted
a
trust
the
fulfillment
of
which
calls
for
the
sternest
integrity
of
purpose
and
the
exercise
of
the
highest
wisdom
the
new
cuba
yet
to
arise
from
the
ashes
of
the
past
must
needs
be
bound
to
us
by
ties
of
singular
intimacy
and
strength
if
its
enduring
welfare
is
to
be
assured
whether
those
ties
shall
be
organic
or
conventional
the
destinies
of
cuba
are
in
some
rightful
form
and
manner
irrevocably
linked
with
our
own
but
how
and
how
far
is
for
the
future
to
determine
in
the
ripeness
of
events
whatever
be
the
outcome
we
must
see
to
it
that
free
cuba
be
a
reality
not
a
name
a
perfect
entity
not
a
hasty
experiment
bearing
within
itself
the
elements
of
failure
our
mission
to
accomplish
which
we
took
up
the
wager
of
battle
is
not
to
be
fulfilled
by
turning
adrift
any
loosely
framed
commonwealth
to
face
the
vicissitudes
which
too
often
attend
weaker
states
whose
natural
wealth
and
abundant
resources
are
offset
by
the
incongruities
of
their
political
organization
and
the
recurring
occasions
for
internal
rivalries
to
sap
their
strength
and
dissipate
their
energies
the
greatest
blessing
which
can
come
to
cuba
is
the
restoration
of
her
agricultural
and
industrial
prosperity
which
will
give
employment
to
idle
men
and
reestablish
the
pursuits
of
peace
this
is
her
chief
and
immediate
need
on
the
th
of
august
last
an
order
was
made
for
the
taking
of
the
census
in
the
island
to
be
completed
on
the
th
of
november
by
the
treaty
of
peace
the
spanish
people
on
the
island
have
until
april
to
elect
whether
they
will
remain
citizens
of
spain
or
become
citizens
of
cuba
until
then
it
cannot
be
definitely
ascertained
who
shall
be
entitled
to
participate
in
the
formation
of
the
government
of
cuba
by
that
time
the
results
of
the
census
will
have
been
tabulated
and
we
shall
proceed
to
provide
for
elections
which
will
commit
the
municipal
governments
of
the
island
to
the
officers
elected
by
the
people
the
experience
thus
acquired
will
prove
of
great
value
in
the
formation
of
a
representative
convention
of
the
people
to
draft
a
constitution
and
establish
a
general
system
of
independent
government
for
the
island
in
the
meantime
and
so
long
as
we
exercise
control
over
the
island
the
products
of
cuba
should
have
a
market
in
the
united
states
on
as
good
terms
and
with
as
favorable
rates
of
duty
as
are
given
to
the
west
india
islands
under
treaties
of
reciprocity
which
shall
be
made
for
the
relief
of
the
distressed
in
the
island
of
cuba
the
war
department
has
issued
supplies
to
destitute
persons
through
the
officers
of
the
army
which
have
amounted
to
rations
at
a
cost
of
to
promote
the
disarmament
of
the
cuban
volunteer
army
and
in
the
interest
of
public
peace
and
the
welfare
of
the
people
the
sum
of
was
paid
to
each
cuban
soldier
borne
upon
the
authenticated
rolls
on
condition
that
he
should
deposit
his
arms
with
the
authorities

the
sum
thus
disbursed
aggregated
which
was
paid
from
the
emergency
fund

by
the
act
of
january
for
that
purpose
out
of
the
cuban
island
revenues
during
the
six
months

expended
for
sanitation
for
charities
and
hospitals

for
aid
to
the
destitute
following
the
exchange
of
ratifications
of

eminent
diplomatist
previously
stationed

while
the

hon
bellamy

its
minister
at

this
was
followed
by
the

appointment
of
consuls
thereby
fully
resuming
the
relations
interrupted
by
the
war

in
addition
to
its
consular
representation
in
the
united
states
the
spanish
government
has
appointed
consuls
for

who
have
been
provisionally
recognized
during
the
military
administration
of
the
affairs
of
that
island
judicial
intercourse
between
the
courts
of
cuba
and
puerto

and
of

has
been
established
as
provided
by
the
treaty
of

the
cuban
political
prisoners
in
spanish
penal
stations
have
been
and
are
being
released
and
returned
to
their
homes
in
accordance
with
article
vi
of
the
treaty
negotiations
are
about
to
be
had
for
defining
the
conventional
relations
between
the
two
countries
which
fell
into
abeyance
by
reason
of
the
war
i
trust
that
these
will
include
a
favorable
arrangement
for
commercial
reciprocity
under
the
terms
of
sections
and
of
the
current
tariff
act
in
these
as
in
all
matters
of
international
concern
no
effort
will
be
spared
to
respond
to
the
good
disposition
of
spain
and
to
cultivate
in
all
practicable
ways
the
intimacy
which
should
prevail
between
two
nations
whose
past
history
has
so
often
and
in
so
many
ways
been
marked
by
sincere
friendship
and
by
community
of
interests
i
would
recommend
appropriate
legislation
in
order
to
carry
into
execution
article
vii
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
spain
by
which
the
united
states
assured
the
payment
of
certain
claims
for
indemnity
of
its
citizens
against
spain
the
united
states
minister
to
turkey
continues
under
instructions
to
press
for
a
money
payment
in
satisfaction
of
the
just
claims
for
injuries
suffered
by
american
citizens
in
the
disorders
of
several
years
past
and
for
wrongs
done
to
them
by
the
ottoman
authorities
some
of
these
claims
are
of
many
years
standing
this
government
is
hopeful
of
a
general
agreement
in
this
regard
in
the
turkish
empire
the
situation
of
our
citizens
remains
unsatisfactory
our
efforts
during
nearly
forty
years
to
bring
about
a
convention
of
naturalization
seem
to
be
on
the
brink
of
final
failure
through
the
announced
policy
of
the
ottoman
porte
to
refuse
recognition
of
the
alien
status
of
native
turkish
subjects
naturalized
abroad
since
our
statutes
do
not
allow
this
government
to
admit
any
distinction
between
the
treatment
of
native
and
naturalized
americans
abroad
so
that
ceaseless
controversy
arises
in
cases
where
persons
owing
in
the
eye
of
international
law
a
dual
allegiance
are
prevented
from
entering
turkey
or
are
expelled
after
entrance
our
law
in
this
regard
contrasts
with
that
of
the
european
states
the
british
act
for
instance
does
not
claim
effect
for
the
naturalization
of
an
alien
in
the
event
of
his
return
to
his
native
country
unless
the
change
be
recognized
by
the
law
of
that
country
or
stipulated
by
treaty
between
it
and
the
naturalizing
state
the
arbitrary
treatment
in
some
instances
of
american
productions
in
turkey
has
attracted
attention
of
late
notably
in
regard
to
our
flour
large
shipments
by
the
recently
opened
direct
steamship
line
to
turkish
ports
have
been
denied
entrance
on
the
score
that
although
of
standard
composition
and
unquestioned
purity
the
flour
was
pernicious
to
health
because
of
deficient
elasticity
as
indicated
by
antiquated
and
untrustworthy
tests
upon
due
protest
by
the
american
minister
and
it
appearing
that
the
act
was
a
virtual
discrimination
against
our
product
the
shipments
in
question
were
admitted
in
these
as
in
all
instances
wherever
occurring
when
american
products
may
be
subjected
in
a
foreign
country
upon
specious
pretexts
to
discrimination
compared
with
the
like
products
of
another
country
this
government
will
use
its
earnest
efforts
to
secure
fair
and
equal
treatment
for
its
citizens
and
their
goods
failing
this
it
will
not
hesitate
to
apply
whatever
corrective
may
be
provided
by
the
statutes
the
international
commission
of
arbitration
appointed
under
the
anglovenezuelan
treaty
of
rendered
an
award
on
october
last
whereby
the
boundary
line
between
venezuela
and
british
guiana
is
determined
thus
ending
a
controversy
which
has
existed
for
the
greater
part
of
the
century
the
award
as
to
which
the
arbitrators
were
unanimous
while
not
meeting
the
extreme
contention
of
either
party
gives
to
great
britain
a
large
share
of
the
interior
territory
in
dispute
and
to
venezuela
the
entire
mouth
of
the
orinoco
including
barima
point
and
the
caribbean
littoral
for
some
distance
to
the
eastward
the
decision
appears
to
be
equally
satisfactory
to
both
parties
venezuela
has
once
more
undergone
a
revolution
the
insurgents
under
general
castro
after
a
sanguinary
engagement
in
which
they
suffered
much
loss
rallied
in
the
mountainous
interior
and
advanced
toward
the
capital
the
bulk
of
the
army
having
sided
with
the
movement
president
andrade
quitted
caracas
where
general
castro
set
up
a
provisional
government
with
which
our
minister
and
the
representatives
of
other
powers
entered
into
diplomatic
relations
on
the
th
of
november
the
fourth
section
of
the
tariff
act
approved
july
appears
to
provide
only
for
commercial
treaties
which
should
be
entered
into
by
the
president
and
also
ratified
by
the
senate
within
two
years
from
its
passage
owing
to
delays
inevitable
in
negotiations
of
this
nature
none
of
the
treaties
initiated
under
that
section
could
be
concluded
in
time
for
ratification
by
the
senate
prior
to
its
adjournment
on
the
th
of
march
last
some
of
the
pending
negotiations
however
were
near
conclusion
at
that
time
and
the
resulting
conventions
have
since
been
signed
by
the
plenipotentiaries
others
within
both
the
third
and
fourth
sections
of
the
act
are
still
under
consideration
acting
under
the
constitutional
power
of
the
executive
in
respect
to
treaties
i
have
deemed
it
my
duty
while
observing
the
limitations
of
concession
provided
by
the
fourth
section
to
bring
to
a
conclusion
all
pending
negotiations
and
submit
them
to
the
senate
for
its
advice
and
consent
conventions
of
reciprocity
have
been
signed
during
the
congressional
recess
with
great
britain
for
the
respective
colonies
of
british
guiana
barbados
bermuda
jamaica
and
turks
and
caicos
islands
and
with
the
republic
of
nicaragua
important
reciprocal
conventions
have
also
been
concluded
with
france
and
with
the
argentine
republic
in
my
last
annual
message
the
progress
noted
in
the
work
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
in
collecting
information
as
to
the
industries
and
commerce
of
other
countries
and
in
the
care
and
promptitude
with
which
their
reports
are
printed
and
distributed
has
continued
during
the
past
year
with
increasingly
valuable
results
in
suggesting
new
sources
of
demand
for
american
products
and
in
pointing
out
the
obstacles
still
to
be
overcome
in
facilitating
the
remarkable
expansion
of
our
foreign
trade
it
will
doubtless
be
gratifying
to
congress
to
learn
that
the
various
agencies
of
the
department
of
state
are
cooperating
in
these
endeavors
with
a
zeal
and
effectiveness
which
are
not
only
receiving
the
cordial
recognition
of
our
business
interests
but
are
exciting
the
emulation
of
other
governments
in
any
rearrangement
of
the
great
and
complicated
work
of
obtaining
official
data
of
an
economic
character
which
congress
may
undertake
it
is
most
important
in
my
judgment
that
the
results
already
secured
by
the
efforts
of
the
department
of
state
should
be
carefully
considered
with
a
view
to
a
judicious
development
and
increased
utility
to
our
export
trade
the
interest
taken
by
the
various
states
forming
the
international
union
of
american
republics
in
the
work
of
its
organic
bureau
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
since
its
creation
in
all
the
republics
of
south
and
central
america
are
now
represented
in
it
the
unanimous
recommendation
of
the
international
american
conference
providing
for
the
international
union
of
american
republics
stated
that
it
should
continue
in
force
during
a
term
of
ten
years
from
the
date
of
its
organization
and
no
country
becoming
a
member
of
the
union
should
cease
to
be
a
member
until
the
end
of
said
period
of
ten
years
and
unless
twelve
months
before
the
expiration
of
said
period
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
union
had
given
to
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
official
notice
of
their
wish
to
terminate
the
union
at
the
end
of
its
first
period
that
the
union
should
continue
to
be
maintained
for
another
period
of
ten
years
and
thereafter
under
the
same
conditions
for
successive
periods
of
ten
years
each
the
period
for
notification
expired
on
july
without
any
of
the
members
having
given
the
necessary
notice
of
withdrawal
its
maintenance
is
therefore
assured
for
the
next
ten
years
in
view
of
this
fact
and
of
the
numerous
questions
of
general
interest
and
common
benefit
to
all
of
the
republics
of
america
some
of
which
were
considered
by
the
first
international
american
conference
but
not
finally
settled
and
others
which
have
since
then
grown
to
importance
it
would
seem
expedient
that
the
various
republics
constituting
the
union
should
be
invited
to
hold
at
an
early
date
another
conference
in
the
capital
of
one
of
the
countries
other
than
the
united
states
which
has
already
enjoyed
this
honor
the
purely
international
character
of
the
work
being
done
by
the
bureau
and
the
appreciation
of
its
value
are
further
emphasized
by
the
active
cooperation
which
the
various
governments
of
the
latin
american
republics
and
their
diplomatic
representatives
in
this
capital
are
now
exhibiting
and
the
zealous
endeavors
they
are
making
to
extend
its
field
of
usefulness
to
promote
through
it
commercial
intercourse
and
strengthen
the
bonds
of
amity
and
confidence
between
its
various

already
entered

performance
of
its
duties
as
provided

i
have
every
reason
to
hope
and
believe
that
this
exposition
will
tend
more
firmly
to
cement
the
cordial
relations
between
the
nations
on
this
continent
in
accordance
with
an
act
of
congress
approved
december
and
under
the
auspices
of
the
philadelphia
commercial
museum
a
most
interesting
and
valuable
exposition
of
products
and
manufactures
especially
adapted
to
export
trade
was
held
in
philadelphia
from
the
th
of
september
to
the
st
of
december
the
representative
character
of
the
exhibits
and
the
widespread
interest
manifested
in
the
special
objects
of
the
undertaking
afford
renewed
encouragement
to
those
who
look
confidently
to
the
steady
growth
of
our
enlarged
exportation
of
manufactured
goods
which
has
been
the
most
remarkable
fact
in
the
economic
development
of
the
united
states
in
recent
years
a
feature
of
this
exposition
which
is
likely
to
become
of
permanent
and
increasing
utility
to
our
industries
is
the
collection
of
samples
of
merchandise
produced
in
various
countries
with
special
reference
to
particular
markets
providing
practical
object
lessons
to
united
states
manufacturers
as
to
qualities
styles
and
prices
of
goods
such
as
meet
the
special
demands
of
consumers
and
may
be
exported
with
advantage
in
connection
with
the
exposition
an
international
commercial
congress
was
held
upon
the
invitation
of
the
philadelphia
commercial
museum
transmitted
by
the
department
of
state
to
the
various
foreign
governments
for
an
exchange
of
information
and
opinions
with
the
view
to
the
promotion
of
international
trade
this
invitation
met
with
general
and
cordial
acceptance
and
the
congress
which
began
its
sessions
at
the
exposition
on
the
th
of
october
proved
to
be
of
great
practical
importance
from
the
fact
that
it
developed
a
general
recognition
of
the
interdependence
of
nations
in
trade
and
a
most
gratifying
spirit
of
accommodation
with
reference
to
the
gradual
removal
of
existing
impediments
to
reciprocal
relations
without
injury
to
the
industrial
interests
of
either
party
in
response
to
the
invitation
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
russia
delegates
from
twentysix
countries
were
assembled
at
the
hague
on
the
th
of
may
as
members
of
a
conference
in
the

of

of

and
the
hon
frederick

holls
secretary
the
occasion
seemed
to
be
opportune
for
the
serious
consideration
of
a
plan
for
the
pacific
adjustment
of
international
differences
a
subject
in
which
the
american
people
have
been
deeply
interested
for
many
years
and
a
definite
project
for
a
permanent
international
tribunal
was
included
in
the
instructions
to
the
delegates
of
the
united
states
the
final
act
of
the
conference
includes
conventions
upon
the
amelioration
of
the
laws
and
customs
of
war
on
land
the
adaptation
to
maritime
warfare
of
the
principles
of
the
geneva
convention
of
and
the
extension
of
judicial
methods
to
international
cases
the
convention
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
conflicts
embodies
the
leading
features
of
the
american
plan
with
such
modifications
as
were
rendered
necessary
by
the
great
diversity
of
views
and
interests
represented
by
the
delegates
the
four
titles
of
the
convention
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
general
peace
the
exercise
of
good
offices
and
mediation
the
formation
of
commissions
of
inquiry
and
international
arbitration
the
mediation
provided
for
by
the
convention
is
purely
voluntary
and
advisory
and
is
intended
to
avoid
any
invasion
or
limitation
of
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
adhering
states
the
commissions
of
inquiry
proposed
consists
of
delegations
to
be
specifically
constituted
for
particular
purposes
by
means
of
conventions
between
the
contesting
parties
having
for
their
object
the
clear
understanding
of
international
differences
before
resorting
to
the
use
of
force
the
provision
for
arbitration
contemplates
the
formation
of
a
permanent
tribunal
before
which
disputed
cases
may
be
brought
for
settlement
by
the
mutual
consent
of
the
litigants
in
each
separate
case
the
advantages
of
such
a
permanent
tribunal
over
impromptu
commissions
of
arbitration
are
conceived
to
be
the
actual
existence
of
a
competent
court
prepared
to
administer
justice
the
greater
economy
resulting
from
a
welldevised
system
and
the
accumulated
judicial
skill
and
experience
which
such
a
tribunal
would
soon
possess
while
earnestly
promoting
the
idea
of
establishing
a
permanent
international
tribunal
the
delegation
of
the
united
states
was
not
unmindful
of
the
inconveniences
which
might
arise
from
an
obtrusive
exercise
of
mediation
and
in
signing
the
convention
carefully
guarded
the
historic
position
of
the
united
states
by
the
following
declaration
nothing
contained
in
this
convention
shall
be
so
construed
as
to
require
the
united
states
of
america
to
depart
from
its
traditional
policy
of
not
intruding
upon
interfering
with
or
entangling
itself
in
the
political
questions
or
policy
or
internal
administration
of
any
foreign
state
nor
shall
anything
contained
in
the
said
convention
be
construed
to
imply
a
relinquishment
by
the
united
states
of
america
of
its
traditional
attitude
toward
purely
american
questions
thus
interpreted
the
convention
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
international
conflicts
may
be
regarded
as
realizing
the
earnest
desire
of
great
numbers
of
american
citizens
whose
deep
sense
of
justice
expressed
in
numerous
resolutions
and
memorials
has
urged
them
to
labor
for
this
noble
achievement
the
general
character
of
this
convention
already
signed
by
the
delegates
of
more
than
twenty
sovereign
states
further
commends
it
to
the
favorable
action
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
whose
ratification
it
still
awaits
since
my
last
annual
message
and
in
obedience
to
the
acts
of
the
congress
of
april
and
the
remaining
volunteer
force
enlisted
for
the
spanish
war
consisting
of
regulars
and

been
discharged

and
of
the

were
entitled
to
be
mustered
out
after
the
ratification
of
the

they
voluntarily
remained
at
the

until
their
places
could
be
filled
by
new
troops

were
returned
home
in
the
order
in
which
they
went
to
manila
and
are
now
all
of
them
out
of
the
service
and
in
the
ranks
of
citizenship
i
recommend
that
the
congress
provide
a
special
medal
of
honor
for
the
volunteers
regulars
sailors
and
marines
on
duty
in
the
philippines
who
voluntarily
remained
in
the
service

the
act

gave
authority
to
increase

exceeding

to
enlist
a
force
of
volunteers

to
san
francisco
of
those
entitled

the
transportation
of
the

to
take
their
places
have
been
a
work
of
great
magnitude
well
and
ably
done
for
which
too
much
credit
cannot
be
given
the
war
department
during
the
past
year
we
have
reduced

throughout
the
united
states
are
officers
and
men
and
in
hawaii
officers
and
enlisted
men
the
operations
of
the
army
are
fully
presented
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
i
cannot
withhold
from
officers
and
men
the
highest
commendation
for
their
soldierly
conduct
in
trying
situations
their
willing
sacrifices
for
their
country
and
the
integrity
and
ability
with
which
they
have
performed
unusual
and
difficult
duties
in
our
island
possessions
in
the
organization
of
the
volunteer
regiments
authorized
by
the
act
of
march
it
was
found
that
no
provision
had
been
made
for
chaplains
this
omission
was
doubtless
from
inadvertence
i
r
ecommend
the
early
authorization
for
the
appointment
of
one
chaplain
for
each
of
said
regiments
these
regiments
are
now
in
the
philippines
and
it
is
important
that
immediate
action
be
had
in
restoring
peaceful
conditions
orderly
rule
and
civic
progress
in
cuba
puerto
rico
and
so
far
as
practicable
in
the
philippines
the
rehabilitation
of
the
postal
service
has
been
an
essential
and
important
part
of
the
work
it
became
necessary
to
provide
mail
facilities
both
for
our
forces
of
occupation
and
for
the
native
population
to
meet
this
requirement
has
involved
a
substantial
reconstruction
the
existing
systems
were
so
fragmentary
defective
and
inadequate
that
a
new
and
comprehensive
organization
had
to
be
created
american
trained
officials
have
been
assigned
to
the
directing
and
executive
positions
while
natives
have
been
chiefly
employed
in
making
up
the
body
of
the
force
in
working
out
this
plan
the
merit
rule
has
been
rigorously
and
faithfully
applied
the
appointment
of
directorgeneral
of
posts
of
cuba
was
given
to
an
expert
who
had
been
chief
postoffice
inspector
and
assistant
postmastergeneral
and
who
united
large
experience
with
administrative
capacity
for
the
postmastership
at
havana
the
range
of
skilled
and
available
men
was
scanned
and
the
choice
fell
upon
one
who
had
been
twenty
years
in
the
service
as
deputy
postmaster
and
postmaster
of
a
large
city
this
principle
governed
and
determined
the
selection
of
the
american
officials
sent
not
only
to
cuba
but
to
puerto
rico
and
the
philippines
and
they
were
instructed
to
apply
it
so
far
as
practicable
in
the
employment
of
the
natives
as
minor
postmasters
and
clerks
the
postal
system
in
cuba
though
remaining
under
the
general
guidance
of
the
postmastergeneral
was
made
essentially
independent
it
was
felt
that
it
should
not
be
a
burden
upon
the
postal
service
of
the
united
states
and
provision
was
made
that
any
deficit
in
the
postal
revenue
should
be
a
charge
upon
the
general
revenues
of
the
island
though
puerto
rico
and
the
philippines
hold
a
different
relation
to
the
united
states
yet
for
convenience
of
administration
the
same
principle
of
an
autonomous
system
has
been
extended
to
them
the
development
of
the
service
in
all
of
the
islands
has
been
rapid
and
successful
it
has
moved
forward
on
american
lines
with
free
delivery
money
order
and
registry
systems
and
has
given
the
people
mail
facilities
far
greater
and
more
reliable
than
any
they
have
ever
before
enjoyed
it
is
thus
not
only
a
vital
agency
of
industrial
social
and
business
progress
but
an
important
influence
in
diffusing
a
just
understanding
of
the
true
spirit
and
character
of
american
administration
the
domestic
postal
service
continues
to
grow
with
extraordinary
rapidity
the
expenditures
and
the
revenues
will
each
exceed
during
the
current
year
fortunately
since
the
revival
of
prosperous
times
the
revenues
have
grown
much
faster
than
the
expenditures
and
there
is
every
indication
that
a
short
period
will
witness
the
obliteration
of
the
annual
deficit
in
this
connection
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
embodies
a
statement
of
some
evils
which
have
grown
up
outside
of
the
contemplation
of
law
in
the
treatment
of
some
classes
of
mail
matter
which
wrongly
exercise
the
privilege
of
the
pound
rate
and
shows
that
if
this
matter
had
been
properly
classified
and
had
paid
the
rate
which
it
should
have
paid
instead
of
a
postal
deficit
for
the
last
fiscal
year
of
there
would
have
been
on
one
basis
a
surplus
of
and
on
another
of
the
reform
thus
suggested
in
the
opinion
of
the
postmastergeneral
would
not
only
put
the
postal
service
at
once
on
a
selfsustaining
basis
but
would
permit
great
and
valuable
improvements
and
i
commend
the
subject
to
the
consideration
of
the
congress
the
navy
has
maintained
the
spirit
and
high
efficiency
which
have
always
characterized
that
service
and
has
lost
none
of
the
gallantry
in
heroic
action
which
has
signalized
its
brilliant
and
glorious
past
the
nation
has
equal
pride
in
its
early
and
later
achievements
its
habitual
readiness
for
every
emergency
has
won
the
confidence
and
admiration
of
the
country
the
people
are
interested
in
the
continued
preparation
and
prestige
of
the
navy
and
will
justify
liberal
appropriations
for
its
maintenance
and
improvement
the
officers
have
shown
peculiar
adaptation
for
the
performance
of
new
and
delicate
duties
which
our
recent
war
has
imposed
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
congress
will
at
once
make
necessary
provision
for
the
armor
plate
for
the
vessels
now
under
contract
and
building
its
attention
is
respectfully
called
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
which
the
subject
is
fully
presented
i
unite
in
his
recommendation
that
the
congress
enact
such
special
legislation
as
may
be
necessary
to
enable
the
department
to
make
contracts
early
in
the
coming
year
for
armor
of
the
best
quality
that
can
be
obtained
in
this
country
for
the
maine
ohio
and
missouri
and
that
the
provision
of
the
act
of
march
limiting
the
price
of
armor
to
per
ton
be
removed
in
the
matter
of
naval
construction
italy
and
japan
of
the
great
powers
laid
down
less
tonnage
in
the
year
than
this
country
and
italy
alone
has
less
tonnage
under
construction
i
heartily
concur
in
the
recommendations
for
the
increase
of
the
navy
as
suggested
by
the
secretary
our
future
progress
and
prosperity
depend
upon
our
ability
to
equal
if
not
surpass
other
nations
in
the
enlargement
and
advance
of
science
industry
and
commerce
to
invention
we
must
turn
as
one
of
the
most
powerful
aids
to
the
accomplishment
of
such
a
result
the
attention
of
the
congress
is
directed
to
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
patents
in
which
will
be
found
valuable
suggestions
and
recommendations
on
the
th
of
june
the
pension
roll
of
the
united
states
numbered
these
include
the
pensioners
of
the
army
and
navy
in
all
our
wars
the
number
added
to
the
rolls
during
the
year
was
the
number
dropped
by
reason
of
death
remarriage
minors
by
legal
limitation
failure
to
claim
within
three
years
and
other
causes
was
and
the
number
of
claims
disallowed
was
during
the
year
pension
certificates
were
issued
of
which
were
for
new
or
original
pensions
the
amount
disbursed
for
army
and
navy
pensions
during
the
year
was
which
was
less
than
the
sum
of
the
appropriations
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
at
its
recent
national
encampment
held
in
philadelphia
has
brought
to
my
attention
and
to
that
of
the
congress
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
a
modification
of
the
third
section
of
the
act
of
june
which
provides
pensions
for
the
widows
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
who
served
ninety
days
or
more
during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
and
were
honorably
discharged
provided
that
such
widows
are
without
other
means
of
sup
port
than
their
daily
labor
and
were
married
to
the
soldier
sailor
or
marine
on
account
of
whose
service
they
claim
pension
prior
to
the
date
of
the
act
the
present
holding
of
the
department
is
that
if
the
widows
income
aside
from
her
daily
labor
does
not
exceed
in
amount
what
her
pension
would
be
to
wit
per
annum
she
would
be
deemed
to
be
without
other
means
of
support
than
her
daily
labor
and
would
be
entitled
to
a
pension
under
this
act
while
if
the
widows
income
independent
of
the
amount
received
by
her
as
the
result
of
her
daily
labor
exceeds
she
would
not
be
pensionable
under
the
act
i
am
advised
by
the
commissioner
of
pensions
that
the
amount
of
the
income
allowed
before
title
to
pension
would
be
barred
has
varied
widely
under
different
administrations
of
the
pension
office
as
well
as
during
different
periods
of
the
same
administration
and
has
been
the
cause
of
just
complaint
and
criticism
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
commissioner
of
pensions
recommends
that
in
order
to
make
the
practice
at
all
times
uniform
and
to
do
justice
to
the
dependent
widow
the
amount
of
income
allowed
independent
of
the
proceeds
of
her
daily
labor
should
be
not
less
than
per
annum
and
he
urges
that
the
congress
shall
so
amend
the
act
as
to
permit
the
pension
office
to
grant
pensionable
status
to
widows
under
the
terms
of
the
third
section
of
the
act
of
june
whose
income
aside
from
the
proceeds
of
daily
labor
is
not
in
excess
of
per
annum
i
believe
this
to
be
a
simple
act
of
justice
and
heartily
recommend
it
the
dawes
commission
reports
that
gratifying
progress
has
been
made
in
its
work
during
the
preceding
year
the
fieldwork
of
enrollment
of
four
of
the
nations
has
been
completed
i
recommend
that
congress
at
an
early
day
make
liberal
appropriation
for
educational
purposes
in
the
indian
territory
in
accordance
with
the
act
of
congress
approved
march
the
preliminary
work
in
connection
with
the
twelfth
census

now
fully
under

for
the
proper
administration
of
the
duties
imposed

been
selected

as

secure

growth
of

broader
and
more
comprehensive
than
any
similar

past
the
director
advises
that
every
needful
effort
is
being
made
to
push
this
great
work
to
completion
in
the
time
limited
by
the
statute
it
is
believed
that
the
twelfth
census
will
emphasize
our
remarkable
advance
in
all
that
pertains
to
national
progress
under
the
authority
of
the
act

approved
july
the
commission
consisting
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
attorneygeneral
and
the
secretary
of

has
made
an
agreement
of
settlement
which
has
had
my
approval
of
the
indebtedness

the
government
growing
out
of
the
issue
of
bonds

aid
in
the
construction

a
review
of
the
relation
of
the
united
states
to
other
powers
always
appropriate
is
this
year
of
primary
importance
in
view
of
the
momentous
issues
which
have
arisen
demanding
in
one
instance
the
ultimate
determination
by
arms
and
involving
farreaching
consequences
which
will
require
the
earnest
attention
of
the
congress
in
my
last
annual
message
very
full
consideration
was
given
to
the
question
of
the
duty
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
toward
spain
and
the
cuban
insurrection
as
being
by
far
the
most
important
problem
with
which
we
were
then
called
upon
to
deal
the
considerations
then
advanced
and
the
exposition
of
the
views
therein
expressed
disclosed
my
sense
of
the
extreme
gravity
of
the
situation
setting
aside
as
logically
unfounded
or
practically
inadmissible
the
recognition
of
the
cuban
insurgents
as
belligerents
the
recognition
of
the
independence
of
cuba
neutral
intervention
to
end
the
war
by
imposing
a
rational
compromise
between
the
contestants
intervention
in
favor
of
one
or
the
other
party
and
forcible
annexation
of
the
island
i
concluded
it
was
honestly
due
to
our
friendly
relations
with
spain
that
she
should
be
given
a
reasonable
chance
to
realize
her
expectations
of
reform
to
which
she
had
become
irrevocably
committed
within
a
few
weeks
previously
she
had
announced
comprehensive
plans
which
it
was
confidently
asserted
would
be
efficacious
to
remedy
the
evils
so
deeply
affecting
our
own
country
so
injurious
to
the
true
interests
of
the
mother
country
as
well
as
to
those
of
cuba
and
so
repugnant
to
the
universal
sentiment
of
humanity
the
ensuing
month
brought
little
sign
of
real
progress
toward
the
pacification
of
cuba
the
autonomous
administrations
set
up
in
the
capital
and
some
of
the
principal
cities
appeared
not
to
gain
the
favor
of
the
inhabitants
nor
to
be
able
to
extend
their
influence
to
the
large
extent
of
territory
held
by
the
insurgents
while
the
military
arm
obviously
unable
to
cope
with
the
still
active
rebellion
continued
many
of
the
most
objectionable
and
offensive
policies
of
the
government
that
had
preceded
it
no
tangible
relief
was
afforded
the
vast
numbers
of
unhappy
reconcentrados
despite
the
reiterated
professions
made
in
that
regard
and
the
amount
appropriated
by
spain
to
that
end
the
proffered
expedient
of
zones
of
cultivation
proved
illusory
indeed
no
less
practical
nor
more
delusive
promises
of
succor
could
well
have
been
tendered
to
the
exhausted
and
destitute
people
stripped
of
all
that
made
life
and
home
dear
and
herded
in
a
strange
region
among
unsympathetic
strangers
hardly
less
necessitous
than
themselves
by
the
end
of
december
the
mortality
among
them
had
frightfully
increased
conservative
estimates
from
spanish
sources
placed
the
deaths
among
these
distressed
people
at
over
per
cent
from
the
time
general
weylers
decree
of
reconcentration
was
enforced
with
the
acquiescence
of
the
spanish
authorities
a
scheme
was
adopted
for
relief
by
charitable
contributions
raised
in
this
country
and
distributed
under
the
direction
of
the
consulgeneral
and
the
several
consuls
by
noble
and
earnest
individual
effort
through
the
organized
agencies
of
the
american
red
cross
thousands
of
lives
were
thus
saved
but
many
thousands
more
were
inaccessible
to
such
forms
of
aid
the
war
continued
on
the
old
footing
without
comprehensive
plan
developing
only
the
same
spasmodic
encounters
barren
of
strategic
result
that
had
marked
the
course
of
the
earlier
ten
years
rebellion
as
well
as
the
present
insurrection
from
its
start
no
alternative
save
physical
exhaustion
of
either
combatant
and
therewithal
the
practical
ruin
of
the
island
lay
in
sight
but
how
far
distant
no
one
could
venture
to
conjecture
at
this
juncture
on
the
th
of
february
last
occurred
the
destruction
of
the
battle
ship
maine
while
rightfully
lying
in
the
harbor
of
havana
on
a
mission
of
international
courtesy
and
good
willa
catastrophe
the
suspicious
nature
and
horror
of
which
stirred
the
nations
heart
profoundly
it
is
a
striking
evidence
of
the
poise
and
sturdy
good
sense
distinguishing
our
national
character
that
this
shocking
blow
falling
upon
a
generous
people
already
deeply
touched
by
preceding
events
in
cuba
did
not
move
them
to
an
instant
desperate
resolve
to
tolerate
no
longer
the
existence
of
a
condition
of
danger
and
disorder
at
our
doors
that
made
possible
such
a
deed
by
whomsoever
wrought
yet
the
instinct
of
justice
prevailed
and
the
nation
anxiously
awaited
the
result
of
the
searching
investigation
at
once
set
on
foot
the
finding
of
the
naval
board
of
inquiry
established
that
the
origin
of
the
explosion
was
external
by
a
submarine
mine
and
only
halted
through
lack
of
positive
testimony
to
fix
the
responsibility
of
its
authorship
all
these
things
carried
conviction
to
the
most
thoughtful
even
before
the
finding
of
the
naval
court
that
a
crisis
in
our
relations
with
spain
and
toward
cuba
was
at
hand
so
strong
was
this
belief
that
it
needed
but
a
brief
executive
suggestion
to
the
congress
to
receive
immediate
answer
to
the
duty
of
making
instant
provision
for
the
possible
and
perhaps
speedily
probable
emergency
of
war
and
the
remarkable
almost
unique
spectacle
was
presented
of
a
unanimous
vote
of
both
houses
on
the
th
of
march
appropriating
for
the
national
defense
and
for
each
and
every
purpose
connected
therewith
to
be
expended
at
the
discretion
of
the
president
that
this
act
of
prevision
came
none
too
soon
was
disclosed
when
the
application
of
the
fund
was
undertaken
our
coasts
were
practically
undefended
our
navy
needed
large
provision
for
increased
ammunition
and
supplies
and
even
numbers
to
cope
with
any
sudden
attack
from
the
navy
of
spain
which
comprised
modern
vessels
of
the
highest
type
of
continental
perfection
our
army
also
required
enlargement
of
men
and
munitions
the
details
of
the
hurried
preparation
for
the
dreaded
contingency
are
told
in
the
reports
of
the
secretaries
of
war
and
of
the
navy
and
need
not
be
repeated
here
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
outbreak
of
war
when
it
did
come
found
our
nation
not
unprepared
to
meet
the
conflict
nor
was
the
apprehension
of
coming
strife
confined
to
our
own
country
it
was
felt
by
the
continental
powers
which
on
april
through
their
ambassadors
and
envoys
addressed
to
the
executive
an
expression
of
hope
that
humanity
and
moderation
might
mark
the
course
of
this
government
and
people
and
that
further
negotiations
would
lead
to
an
agreement
which
while
securing
the
maintenance
of
peace
would
afford
all
necessary
guaranties
for
the
reestablishment
of
order
in
cuba
in
responding
to
that
representation
i
said
i
shared
the
hope
the
envoys
had
expressed
that
peace
might
be
preserved
in
a
manner
to
terminate
the
chronic
condition
of
disturbance
in
cuba
so
injurious
and
menacing
to
our
interests
and
tranquillity
as
well
as
shocking
to
our
sentiments
of
humanity
and
while
appreciating
the
humanitarian
and
disinterested
character
of
the
communication
they
had
made
on
behalf
of
the
powers
i
stated
the
confidence
of
this
government
for
its
part
that
equal
appreciation
would
be
shown
for
its
own
earnest
and
unselfish
endeavors
to
fulfill
a
duty
to
humanity
by
ending
a
situation
the
indefinite
prolongation
of
which
had
become
insufferable
still
animated
by
the
hope
of
a
peaceful
solution
and
obeying
the
dictates
of
duty
no
effort
was
relaxed
to
bring
about
a
speedy
ending
of
the
cuban
struggle
negotiations
to
this
object
continued
actively
with
the
government
of
spain
looking
to
the
immediate
conclusion
of
a
six
months
armistice
in
cuba
with
a
view
to
effect
the
recognition
of
her
peoples
right
to
independence
besides
this
the
instant
revocation
of
the
order
of
reconcentration
was
asked
so
that
the
sufferers
returning
to
their
homes
and
aided
by
united
american
and
spanish
effort
might
be
put
in
a
way
to
support
themselves
and
by
orderly
resumption
of
the
wellnigh
destroyed
productive
energies
of
the
island
contribute
to
the
restoration
of
its
tranquillity
and
wellbeing
negotiations
continued
for
some
little
time
at
madrid
resulting
in
offers
by
the
spanish
government
which
could
not
but
be
regarded
as
inadequate
it
was
proposed
to
confide
the
preparation
of
peace
to
the
insular
parliament
yet
to
be
convened
under
the
autonomous
decrees
of
november
but
without
impairment
in
any
wise
of
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
madrid
government
which
to
that
end
would
grant
an
armistice
if
solicited
by
the
insurgents
for
such
time
as
the
general
in
chief
might
see
fit
to
fix
how
and
with
what
scope
of
discretionary
powers
the
insular
parliament
was
expected
to
set
about
the
preparation
of
peace
did
not
appear
if
it
were
to
be
by
negotiation
with
the
insurgents
the
issue
seemed
to
rest
on
the
one
side
with
a
body
chosen
by
a
fraction
of
the
electors
in
the
districts
under
spanish
control
and
on
the
other
with
the
insurgent
population
holding
the
interior
country
unrepresented
in
the
socalled
parliament
and
defiant
at
the
suggestion
of
suing
for
peace
grieved
and
disappointed
at
this
barren
outcome
of
my
sincere
endeavors
to
reach
a
practicable
solution
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
remit
the
whole
question
to
t
he
congress
in
the
message
of
april
i
announced
that
with
this
last
overture
in
the
direction
of
immediate
peace
in
cuba
and
its
disappointing
reception
by
spain
the
effort
of
the
executive
was
brought
to
an
end
i
again
reviewed
the
alternative
courses
of
action
which
had
been
proposed
concluding
that
the
only
one
consonant
with
international
policy
and
compatible
with
our
firmset
historical
traditions
was
intervention
as
a
neutral
to
stop
the
war
and
check
the
hopeless
sacrifice
of
life
even
though
that
resort
involved
hostile
constraint
upon
both
the
parties
to
the
contest
as
well
to
enforce
a
truce
as
to
guide
the
eventual
settlement
the
grounds
justifying
that
step
were
the
interests
of
humanity
the
duty
to
protect
the
life
and
property
of
our
citizens
in
cuba
the
right
to
check
injury
to
our
commerce
and
people
through
the
devastation
of
the
island
and
most
important
the
need
of
removing
at
once
and
forever
the
constant
menace
and
the
burdens
entailed
upon
our
government
by
the
uncertainties
and
perils
of
the
situation
caused
by
the
unendurable
disturbance
in
cuba
i
said
the
long
trial
has
proved
that
the
object
for
which
spain
has
waged
the
war
can
not
be
attained
the
fire
of
insurrection
may
flame
or
may
smolder
with
varying
seasons
but
it
has
not
been
and
it
is
plain
that
it
can
not
be
extinguished
by
present
methods
the
only
hope
of
relief
and
repose
from
a
condition
which
can
no
longer
be
endured
is
the
enforced
pacification
of
cuba
in
the
name
of
humanity
in
the
name
of
civilization
in
behalf
of
endangered
american
interests
which
give
us
the
right
and
the
duty
to
speak
and
to
act
the
war
in
cuba
must
stop
in
view
of
all
this
the
congress
was
asked
to
authorize
and
empower
the
president
to
take
measures
to
secure
a
full
and
final
termination
of
hostilities
between
spain
and
the
people
of
cuba
and
to
secure
in
the
island
the
establishment
of
a
stable
government
capable
of
maintaining
order
and
observing
its
international
obligations
insuring
peace
and
tranquillity
and
the
security
of
its
citizens
as
well
as
our
own
and
for
the
accomplishment
of
those
ends
to
use
the
military
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
as
might
be
necessary
with
added
authority
to
continue
generous
relief
to
the
starving
people
of
cuba
the
response
of
the
congress
after
nine
days
of
earnest
deliberation
during
which
the
almost
unanimous
sentiment
of
your
body
was
developed
on
every
point
save
as
to
the
expediency
of
coupling
the
proposed
action
with
a
formal
recognition
of
the
republic
of
cuba
as
the
true
and
lawful
government
of
that
islanda
proposition
which
failed
of

on
the
th
of
april
by
a
vote
of
to
in
the
senate
and
to
in

house
of

passed
the
memorable
joint
resolution
declaring
first
that
the
people
of
the
island
of
cuba
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
second
that
it
is
the

and
the
government
of

does
hereby
demand
that
the
government

relinquish
its
authority
and
government
in
the
island
of
cuba
and
withdraw
its
land

and
cuban
waters
third
that

hereby
is

and
empowered
to
use
the
entire

and
naval
forces
of
the

states
and
to
call
into
the
actual
service
of
the
united
states
the
militia
of
the
several
states
to
such
extent
as
may
be
necessary
to
carry
these
resolutions
into
effect
fourth
that
the
united
states
hereby
disclaims
any
disposition
or
intention
to
exercise
sovereignty
jurisdiction
or
control
over
said
island
except
for
the
pacification
thereof
and
asserts
its
determination
when
that
is
accomplished
to
leave
the
government
and
control
of
the
island
to
its
people
this
resolution
was
approved
by
the
executive
on
the
next
day
april
a
copy
was
at
once
communicated
to
the
spanish
minister
at
this
capital
who
forthwith
announced
that
his
continuance
in
washington
had
thereby
become
impossible
and
asked
for
his
passports
which
were
given
him
he
thereupon
withdrew
from
washington
leaving
the
protection
of
spanish
interests
in
the
united
states
to
the
french
ambassador
and
the
austrohungarian
minister
simultaneously
with
its
communication
to
the
spanish
minister
here
general
woodford
the
american
minister
at
madrid
was
telegraphed
confirmation
of
the
text
of
the
joint
resolution
and
directed
to
communicate
it
to
the
government
of
spain
with
the
formal
demand
that
it
at
once
relinquish
its
authority
and
government
in
the
island
of
cuba
and
withdraw
its
forces
therefrom
coupling
this
demand
with
announcement
of
the
intentions
of
this
government
as
to
the
future
of
the
island
in
conformity
with
the
fourth
clause
of
the
resolution
and
giving
spain
until
noon
of
april
to
reply
that
demand
although
as
above
shown
officially
made
known
to
the
spanish
envoy
here
was
not
delivered
at
madrid
after
the
instruction
reached
general
woodford
on
the
morning
of
april
but
before
he
could
present
it
the
spanish
minister
of
state
notified
him
that
upon
the
presidents
approval
of
the
joint
resolution
the
madrid
government
regarding
the
act
as
equivalent
to
an
evident
declaration
of
war
had
ordered
its
minister
in
washington
to
withdraw
thereby
breaking
off
diplomatic
relations
between
the
two
countries
and
ceasing
all
official
communication
between
their
respective
representatives
general
woodford
thereupon
demanded
his
passports
and
quitted
madrid
the
same
day
spain
having
thus
denied
the
demand
of
the
united
states
and
initiated
that
complete
form
of
rupture
of
relations
which
attends
a
state
of
war
the
executive
powers
authorized
by
the
resolution
were
at
once
used
by
me
to
meet
the
enlarged
contingency
of
actual
war
between
sovereign
states
on
april
i
proclaimed
a
blockade
of
the
north
coast
of
cuba
including
ports
on
said
coast
between
cardenas
and
bahia
honda
and
the
port
of
cienfuegos
on
the
south
coast
of
cuba
and
on
the
d
i
called
for
volunteers
to
execute
the
purpose
of
the
resolution
by
my
message
of
april
the
congress
was
informed
of
the
situation
and
i
recommended
formal
declaration
of
the
existence
of
a
state
of
war
between
the
united
states
and
spain
the
congress
accordingly
voted
on
the
same
day
the
act
approved
april
declaring
the
existence
of
such
war
from
and
including
the
st
day
of
april
and
reenacted
the
provision
of
the
resolution
of
april
directing
the
president
to
use
all
the
armed
forces
of
the
nation
to
carry
that
act
into
effect
due
notification
of
the
existence
of
war
as
aforesaid
was
given
april
by
telegraph
to
all
the
governments
with
which
the
united
states
maintain
relations
in
order
that
their
neutrality
might
be
assured
during
the
war
the
various
governments
responded
with
proclamations
of
neutrality
each
after
its
own
methods
it
is
not
among
the
least
gratifying
incidents
of
the
struggle
that
the
obligations
of
neutrality
were
impartially
discharged
by
all
often
under
delicate
and
difficult
circumstances
in
further
fulfillment
of
international
duty
i
issued
april
a
proclamation
announcing
the
treatment
proposed
to
be
accorded
to
vessels
and
their
cargoes
as
to
blockade

the
exercise
of
the
right
of
search
and
the
immunity
of
neutral
flags
and
neutral
goods
under
enemys
flag
a
similar
proclamation
was
made
by
the
spanish
government
in
the
conduct
of
hostilities
the
rules
of
the
declaration
of
paris
including
abstention
from
resort
to
privateering
have
accordingly
been
observed
by
both
belligerents
although
neither
was
a
party
to
that
declaration
our
country
thus
after
an
interval
of
half
a
century
of
peace
with
all
nations
found
itself
engaged
in
deadly
conflict
with
a
foreign
enemy
every
nerve
was
strained
to
meet
the
emergency
the
response
to
the
initial
call
for
volunteers
was
instant
and
complete
as
was
also
the
result
of
the
second
call
of

gear
suitable
both
for
the
destruction
of
communications
belonging
to
the
enemy
and
the
establishment
of
our
own
two
ocean
cables
were
destroyed
under
the
enemys
batteries
at
santiago
the
day
previous
to
the
landing
of
general
shafters
corps
at
caimanera
within
miles
of
the
landing
place
cable
communications
were
established
and
a
cable
station
opened
giving
direct
communication
with
the
government
at
washington
this
service
was
invaluable
to
the
executive
in
directing
the
operations
of
the
army
and
navy
with
a
total
force
of

the
loss

by
disease
in

and
field
officers
and
men
included
only
the
nationaldefense
fund
of
was
expended
in
large
part
by
the
army
and
navy
and
the
objects
for
which
it
was
used
are
fully
shown
in
the
reports
of
the
several
secretaries
it
was
a
most
timely
appropriation
enabling
the
government
to
strengthen
its
defenses
and
make
preparations
greatly
needed
in
case
of
war
this
fund
being
inadequate
to
the
requirements
of
equipment
and
for
the
conduct
of
the
war
the
patriotism
of
the
congress
provided
the
means
in
the
warrevenue
act
of
june
by
authorizing
a
per
cent
popular
loan
not
to
exceed
and
by
levying
additional
imposts
and
taxes
of
the
authorized
loan
were
offered
and
promptly
taken
the
subscriptions
so
far
exceeding
the
call
as
to
cover
it
many
times
over
while
preference
being
given
to
the
smaller
bids
no
single
allotment
exceeded
this
was
a
most
encouraging
and
significant
result
showing
the
vast
resources
of
the
nation
and
the
determination
of
the
people
to
uphold
their
countrys
honor
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
this
message
to
narrate
the
history
of
the
extraordinary
war
that
followed
the
spanish
declaration
of
april
but
a
brief
recital
of
its
more
salient
features
is
appropriate
the
first
encounter
of
the
war
in
point
of
date
took
place
april
when
a
detachment
of
the
blockading
squadron
made
a
reconnoissance
in
force
at
matanzas
shelled
the
harbor
forts
and
demolished
several
new
works
in
construction
the
next
engagement
was
destined
to
mark
a
memorable
epoch
in
maritime
warfare
the
pacific
fleet
under
commodore
george
dewey
had
lain
for
some
weeks
at
hongkong
upon
the
colonial
proclamation
of
neutrality
being
issued
and
the
customary
twentyfour
hours
notice
being
given
it
repaired
to
mirs
bay
near
hongkong
whence
it
proceeded
to
the
philippine
islands
under
telegraphed
orders
to
capture
or
destroy
the
formidable
spanish
fleet
then
assembled
at
manila
at
daybreak
on
the
st
of
may
the
american
force
entered
manila
bay
and
after
a
few
hours
engagement
effected
the
total
destruction
of
the
spanish
fleet
consisting
of
ten
war
ships
and
a
transport
besides
capturing
the
naval
station
and
forts
at
cavite
thus
annihilating
the
spanish
naval
power
in
the
pacific
ocean
and
completely
controlling
the
bay
of
manila
with
the
ability
to
take
the
city
at
will
not
a
life
was
lost
on
our
ships
the
wounded
only
numbering
seven
while
not
a
vessel
was
materially
injured
for
this
gallant
achievement
the
congress
upon
my
recommendation
fitly
bestowed
upon
the
actors
preferment
and
substantial
reward
the
effect
of
this
remarkable
victory
upon
the
spirit
of
our
people
and
upon
the
fortunes
of
the
war
was
instant
a
prestige
of
invincibility
thereby
attached
to
our
arms
which
continued
throughout
the
struggle
reenforcements
were
hurried
to
manila
under
the
command
of
majorgeneral
merritt
and
firmly
established
within
sight
of
the
capital
which
lay
helpless
before
our
guns
on
the
th
day
of
may
the
government
was
advised
officially
of
the
victory
at
manila
and
at
once
inquired
of
the
commander
of
our
fleet
what
troops
would
be
required
the
information
was
received
on
the
th
day
of
may
and
the
first
army
expedition
sailed
may
and
arrived
off
manila
june
other
expeditions
soon
followed
the
total
force
consisting
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
only
reluctance
to
cause
needless
loss
of
life
and
property
prevented
the
early
storming
and
capture
of
the
city
and
therewith
the
absolute
military
occupancy
of
the
whole
group
the
insurgents
meanwhile
had
resumed
the
active
hostilities
suspended
by
the
uncompleted
truce
of
december
their
forces
invested
manila
from
the
northern
and
eastern
sides
but
were
constrained
by
admiral
dewey
and
general
merrill
from
attempting
an
assault
it
was
fitting
that
whatever
was
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
decisive
operations
in
that
quarter
should
be
accomplished
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
united
states
alone
obeying
the
stern
precept
of
war
which
enjoins
the
overcoming
of
the
adversary
and
the
extinction
of
his
power
wherever
assailable
as
the
speedy
and
sure
means
to
win
a
peace
divided
victory
was
not
permissible
for
no
partition
of
the
rights
and
responsibilities
attending
the
enforcement
of
a
just
and
advantageous
peace
could
be
thought
of
following
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
general
attack
powerful
forces
were
assembled
at
various
points
on
our
coast
to
invade
cuba
and
puerto
rico
meanwhile
naval
demonstrations
were
made
at
several
exposed
points
on
may
the
cruiser
wilmington
and
torpedo
boat
winslow
were
unsuccessful
in
an
attempt
to
silence
the
batteries
at
cardenas
a
gallant
ensign
worth
bagley
and
four
seamen
falling
these
grievous
fatalities
were
strangely
enough
among
the
very
few
which
occurred
during
our
naval
operations
in
this
extraordinary
conflict
meanwhile
the
spanish
naval
preparations
had
been
pushed
with
great
vigor
a
powerful
squadron
under
admiral
cervera
which
had
assembled
at
the
cape
verde
islands
before
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
had
crossed
the
ocean
and
by
its
erratic
movements
in
the
caribbean
sea
delayed
our
military
plans
while
baffling
the
pursuit
of
our
fleets
for
a
time
fears
were
felt
lest
the
oregon
and
marietta
then
nearing
home
after
their
long
voyage
from
san
francisco
of
over
miles
might
be
surprised
by
admiral
cerveras
fleet
but
their
fortunate
arrival
dispelled
these
apprehensions
and
lent
muchneeded
reenforcement
not
until
admiral
cervera
took
refuge
in
the
harbor
of
santiago
de
cuba
about
may
was
it
practicable
to
plan
a
systematic
naval
and
military
attack
upon
the
antillean
possessions
of
spain
several
demonstrations
occurred
on
the
coasts
of
cuba
and
puerto
rico
in
preparation
for
the
larger
event
on
may
the
north
atlantic
squadron
shelled
san
juan
de
puerto
rico
on
may
commodore
schleys
squadron
bombarded
the
forts
guarding
the
mouth
of
santiago
harbor
neither
attack
had
any
material
result
it
was
evident
that
wellordered
land
operations
were
indispensable
to
achieve
a
decisive
advantage
the
next
act
in
the
war
thrilled
not
alone
the
hearts
of
our
countrymen
but
the
world
by
its
exceptional
heroism
on
the
night
of
june
lieutenant
hobson
aided
by
seven
devoted
volunteers
blocked
the
narrow
outlet
from
santiago
harbor
by
sinking
the
collier
merrimac
in
the
channel
under
a
fierce
fire
from
the
shore
batteries
escaping
with
their
lives
as
by
a
miracle
but
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
it
is
a
most
gratifying
incident
of
the
war
that
the
bravery
of
this
little
band
of
heroes
was
cordially
appreciated
by
the
spanish
admiral
who
sent
a
flag
of
truce
to
notify
admiral
sampson
of
their
safety
and
to
compliment
them
on
their
daring
act
they
were
subsequently
exchanged
july
by
june
the
cutting
of
the
last
cuban
cable
isolated
the
island
thereafter
the
invasion
was
vigorously
prosecuted
on
june
under
a
heavy
protecting
fire
a
landing
of
marines
from
the
oregon
marblehead
and
yankee
was
effected
in
guantanamo
bay
where
it
had
been
determined
to
establish
a
naval
station
this
important
and
essential
port
was
taken
from
the
enemy
after
severe
fighting
by
the
marines
who
were
the
first
organized
force
of
the
united
states
to
land
in
cuba
the
position
so
won
was
held
despite
desperate
attempts
to
dislodge
our
forces
by
june
additional
forces
were
landed
and
strongly
intrenched
on
june
the
advance
of
the
invading
army
under
majorgeneral
shafter
landed
at
daiquiri
about
miles
east
of
santiago
this
was
accomplished
under
great
difficulties
but
with
marvelous
dispatch
on
june
the
movement
against
santiago
was
begun
on
the
th
the
first
serious
engagement
took
place
in
which
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
and
the
first
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
general
youngs
brigade
of
general
wheelers
division
participated
losing
heavily
by
nightfall
however
ground
within
miles
of
santiago
was
won
the
advantage
was
steadily
increased
on
july
a
severe
battle
took
place
our
forces
gaining
the
outworks

of
santiago
on
the
d
el
caney
and
san
juan
were
taken
after
a
desperate
charge
and
the
investment
of
the
city
was
completed
the
navy
cooperated
by
shelling
the
town
and
the
coast
forts
on
the
day
following
this
brilliant
achievement
of
our
land
forces
the
d
of
july
occurred
the
decisive
naval
combat
of
the
war
the
spanish
fleet
attempting
to
leave
the
harbor
was
met
by
the
american
squadron
under
command
of
commodore
sampson
in
less
than
three
hours
all
the
spanish
ships
were
destroyed
the
two
torpedo
boats
being
sunk
and
the
maria
teresa
almirante
oquendo
vizcaya
and
cristobal
colon
driven
ashore
the
spanish
admiral
and
over
men
were
taken
prisoners
while
the
enemys
loss
of
life
was
deplorably
large
some
perishing
on
our
side
but
one
man
was
killed
on
the
brooklyn
and
one
man
seriously
wounded
although
our
ships
were
repeatedly
struck
not
one
was
seriously
injured
where
all
so
conspicuously
distinguished
themselves
from
the
commanders
to
the
gunners
and
the
unnamed
heroes
in
the
boiler
rooms
each
and
all
contributing
toward
the
achievement
of
this
astounding
victory
for
which
neither
ancient
nor
modern
history
affords
a
parallel
in
the
completeness
of
the
event
and
the
marvelous
disproportion
of
casualties
it
would
be
invidious
to
single
out
any
for
especial
honor
deserved
promotion
has
rewarded
the
more
conspicuous
actors
the
nations
profoundest
gratitude
is
due
to
all
of
these
brave
men
who
by
their
skill
and
devotion
in
a
few
short
hours
crushed
the
sea
power
of
spain
and
wrought
a
triumph
whose
decisiveness
and
farreaching
consequences
can
scarcely
be
measured
nor
can
we
be
unmindful
of
the
achievements
of
our
builders
mechanics
and
artisans
for
their
skill
in
the
construction
of
our
war
ships
with
the
catastrophe
of
santiago
spains
effort
upon
the
ocean
virtually
ceased
a
spasmodic
effort
toward
the
end
of
june
to
send
her
mediterranean
fleet
under
admiral
camara
to
relieve
manila
was
abandoned
the
expedition
being
recalled
after
it
had
passed
through
the
suez
canal
the
capitulation
of
santiago
followed
the
city
was
closely
besieged
by
land
while
the
entrance
of
our
ships
into
the
harbor
cut
off
all
relief
on
that
side
after
a
truce
to
allow
of
the
removal
of
noncombatants
protracted
negotiations
continued
from
july
until
july
when
under
menace
of
immediate
assault
the
preliminaries
of
surrender
were
agreed
upon
on
the
th
general
shafter
occupied
the
city
the
capitulation
embraced
the
entire
eastern
end
of
cuba
the
number
of
spanish
soldiers
surrendering
was
all
of
whom
were
subsequently
conveyed
to
spain
at
the
charge
of
the
united
states
the
story
of
this
successful
campaign
is
told
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
which
will
be
laid
before
you
the
individual
valor
of
officers
and
soldiers
was
never
more
strikingly
shown
than
in
the
several
engagements
leading
to
the
surrender
of
santiago
while
the
prompt
movements
and
successive
victories
won
instant
and
universal
applause
to
those
who
gained
this
complete
triumph
which
established
the
ascendency
of
the
united
states
upon
land
as
the
fight
off
santiago
had
fixed
our
supremacy
on
the
seas
the
earnest
and
lasting
gratitude
of
the
nation
is
unsparingly
due
nor
should
we
alone
remember
the
gallantry
of
the
living
the
dead
claim
our
tears
and
our
losses
by
battle
and
disease
must
cloud
any
exultation
at
the
result
and
teach
us
to
weigh
the
awful
cost
of
war
however
rightful
the
cause
or
signal
the
victory
with
the
fall
of
santiago
the
occupation
of
puerto
rico
became
the
next
strategic
necessity
general
miles
had
previously
been
assigned
to
organize
an
expedition
for
that
purpose
fortunately
he
was
already
at
santiago
where
he
had
arrived
on
the
th
of
july
with
reenforcements
for
general
shafters
army
with
these
troops
consisting
of
infantry
and
artillery
two
companies
of
engineers
and
one
company
of
the
signal
corps
general
miles
left
guantanamo
on

having
nine
transports
convoyed
by
the
fleet
under
captain
higginson
with
the
massachusetts
flagship
dixie
gloucester
columbia
and
yale
the
two
latter
carrying
troops
the
expedition
landed
at
guanica
july
which
port
was
entered
with
little
opposition
here
the
fleet
was
joined
by
the
annapolis
and
the
wasp
while
the
puritan
and
amphitrite
went
to
san
juan
and
joined
the
new
orleans
which
was
engaged
in
blockading
that
port
the
majorgeneral
commanding
was
subsequently
reenforced
by
general
schwans
brigade
of
the
third
army
corps
by
general
wilson
with
a
part
of
his
division
and
also
by
general
brooke
with
a
part
of
his
corps
numbering
in
all
officers
and
men
on
july
he
entered
ponce
one
of
the
most
important
ports
in
the
island
from
which
he
thereafter
directed
operations
for
the
capture
of
the
island
with
the
exception
of
encounters
with
the
enemy
at
guayama
hormigueros
coamo
and
yauco
and
an
attack
on
a
force
landed
at
cape
san
juan
there
was
no
serious
resistance
the
campaign
was
prosecuted
with
great
vigor
and
by
the
th
of
august
much
of
the
island
was
in
our
possession
and
the
acquisition
of
the
remainder
was
only
a
matter
of
a
short
time
at
most
of
the
points
in
the
island
our
troops
were
enthusiastically
welcomed
protestations
of
loyalty
to
the
flag
and
gratitude
for
delivery
from
spanish
rule
met
our
commanders
at
every
stage
as
a
potent
influence
toward
peace
the
outcome
of
the
puerto
rican
expedition
was
of
great
consequence
and
generous
commendation
is
due
to
those
who
participated
in
it
the
last
scene
of
the
war
was
enacted
at
manila
its
starting
place
on
august
after
a
brief
assault
upon
the
works
by
the
land
forces
in
which
the
squadron
assisted
the
capital
surrendered
unconditionally
the
casualties
were
comparatively
few
by
this
the
conquest
of
the
philippine
islands
virtually
accomplished
when
the
spanish
capacity
for
resistance
was
destroyed
by
admiral
deweys
victory
of
the
st
of
may
was
formally
sealed
to
general
merrill
his
officers
and
men
for
their
uncomplaining
and
devoted
service
and
for
their
gallantry
in
action
the
nation
is
sincerely
grateful
their
long
voyage
was
made
with
singular
success
and
the
soldierly
conduct
of
the
men
most
of
whom
were
without
previous
experience
in
the
military
service
deserves
unmeasured
praise
the
total
casualties
in
killed
and
wounded
in
the
army
during
the
war
with
spain
were
officers
killed
enlisted
men
killed
total
officers
wounded
enlisted

wounded
total
of
the
navy
killed
wounded
died
as
result
of
wounds
invalided
from
service
total
it
will
be
observed
that
while
our
navy
was
engaged
in
two
great
battles
and
in
numerous
perilous
undertakings
in
blockade
and
bombardment
and
more
than
of
our
troops
were
transported
to
distant
lands
and
were
engaged
in
assault
and
siege
and
battle
and
many
skirmishes
in
unfamiliar
territory
we
lost
in
both
arms
of
the
service
a
total
of
killed
and
wounded
and
in
the
entire
campaign
by
land
and
sea
we
did
not
lose
a
gun
or
a
flag
or
a
transport
or
a
ship
and
with
the
exception
of
the
crew
of
the
merrimac
not
a
soldier
or
sailor
was
taken
prisoner
on
august
fortysix
days
from
the
date
of
the
landing
of
general
shafters
army
in
cuba
and
twentyone
days
from
the
surrender
of
santiago
the
united
states
troops
commenced
embarkation
for
home
and
our
entire
force
was
returned
to
the
united
states
as
early
as
august
they
were
absent
from
the
united
states
only
two
months
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
bear
testimony
to
the
patriotism
and
devotion
of
that
large
portion
of
our
army
which
although
eager
to
be
ordered
to
the
post
of
greatest
exposure
fortunately
was
not
required
outside
of
the
united
states
they
did
their
whole
duty
and
like
their
comrades
at
the
front
have
earned
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
in
like
manner
the
officers
and
men
of
the
army
and
of
the
navy
who
remained
in
their
departments
and
stations
faithfully
performing
most
important
duties
connected
with
the
war
and
whose
requests
for
assignment
in
the
field
and
at
sea
i
was
compelled
to
refuse
because
their
services
were
indispensable
here
are
entitled
to
the
highest
commendation
it
is
my
regret
that
there
seems
to
be
no
provision
for
their
suitable
recognition
in
this
connection
it
is
a
pleasure
for
me
to
mention
in
terms
of
cordial
appreciation
the
timely
and
useful
work
of
the
american
national
red
cross
both
in
relief
measures
preparatory
to
the
campaigns
in
sanitary
assistance
at
several
of
the
camps
of
assemblage
and
later
under
the
able
and
experienced
leadership
of
the
president
of
the
society
miss
clara
barton
on
the
fields
of
battle
and
in
the
hospitals
at
the
front
in
cuba
working
in
conjunction
with
the
governmental
authorities
and
under
their
sanction
and
approval
and
with
the
enthusiastic
cooperation
of
many
patriotic
women
and
societies
in
the
various
states
the
red
cross
has
fully
maintained
its
already
high
reputation
for
intense
earnestness
and
ability
to
exercise
the
noble
purposes
of
its
international
organization
thus
justifying
the
confidence
and
support
which
it
has
received
at
the
hands
of
the
american
people
to
the
members
and
officers
of
this
society
and
all
who
aided
them
in
their
philanthropic
work
the
sincere
and
lasting
gratitude
of
the
soldiers
and
the
public
is
due
and
is
freely
accorded
in
tracing
these
events
we
are
constantly
reminded
of
our
obligations
to
the
divine
master
for
his
watchful
care
over
us
and
his
safe
guidance
for
which
the
nation
makes
reverent
acknowledgment
and
offers
humble
prayer
for
the
continuance
of
his
favor
the
annihilation
of
admiral
cerveras
fleet
followed
by
the
capitulation
of
santiago
having
brought
to
the
spanish
government
a
realizing
sense
of
the
hopelessness
of
continuing
a
struggle
now
become
wholly
unequal
it
made
overtures
of
peace
through
the
french
ambassador
who
with
the
assent
of
his
government
had
acted
as
the
friendly
representative
of
spanish
interests
during
the

on

it
accepted
unconditionally
the
terms
imposed
as
to
cuba
puerto
rico
and
an
island
of
the
ladrones
group
but
appeared
to
seek
to
introduce
inadmissible
reservations
in
regard
to
our
demand
as
to
the
philippine
islands
conceiving
that
discussion
on
this
point
could
neither
be
practical
nor
profitable
i
directed
that
in
order
to
avoid
misunderstanding
the
matter
should
be
forthwith
closed
by
proposing
the
embodiment
in
a
formal
protocol
of
the
terms
upon
which
the
negotiations
for
peace
were
to
be
undertaken
the
vague
and
inexplicit
suggestions
of

not
be
accepted

to

as
a
virtual
ultimatum

their
negotiations
have
made
hopeful
progress
so
that
i
trust
soon
to
be
able
to
lay
a
definitive
treaty
of
peace
before
the
senate
with
a
review
of
the
steps
leading
to
its
signature
i
do
not

at

the
government
or
the
future
of
the
new
possessions
which
will
come
to
us
as
the
result
of
the
war
with
spain
such
discussion
will
be
appropriate
after
the
treaty
of
peace
shall
be
ratified
in
the
meantime
and
until
the
congress
has
legislated
otherwise
it
will
be
my
duty
to
continue
the
military
governments
which
have
existed
since
our
occupation
and
give
to
the
people
security
in
life
and
property
and
encouragement
under
a
just
and
beneficent
rule
as
soon
as
we
are
in
possession
of
cuba
and
have
pacified
the
island
it
will
be
necessary
to
give
aid
and
direction
to
its
people
to
form
a
government
for
themselves
this
should
be
undertaken
at
the
earliest
moment
consistent
with
safety
and
assured
success
it
is
important
that
our
relations
with
this
people
shall
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
and
our
commercial
relations
close
and
reciprocal
it
should
be
our
duty
to
assist
in
every
proper
way
to
build
up
the
waste
places
of
the
island
encourage
the
industry
of
the
people
and
assist
them
to
form
a
government
which
shall
be
free
and
independent
thus
realizing
the
best
aspirations
of
the
cuban
people
spanish
rule
must
be
replaced
by
a
just
benevolent
and
humane
government
created
by
the
people
of
cuba
capable
of
performing
all
international
obligations
and
which
shall
encourage
thrift
industry
and
prosperity
and
promote
peace
and
good
will
among
all
of
the
inhabitants
whatever
may
have
been
their
relations
in
the
past
neither
revenge
nor
passion
should
have
a
place
in
the
new
government
until
there
is
complete
tranquillity
in
the
island
and
a
stable
government
inaugurated
military
occupation
will
be
continued
with
the
one
exception
of
the
rupture
with
spain
the
intercourse
of
the
united
states
with
the
great
family
of
nations
has
been
marked
with
cordiality
and
the
close
of
the
eventful
year
finds
most
of
the
issues
that
necessarily
arise
in
the
complex
relations
of
sovereign
states
adjusted
or
presenting
no
serious
obstacle
to
a
just
and
honorable
solution
by
amicable
agreement
a
long
unsettled
dispute
as
to
the
extended
boundary
between
the
argentine
republic
and
chile
stretching
along
the
andean
crests
from
the
southern
border
of
the
atacama
desert
to
magellan
straits
nearly
a
third
of
the
length
of
the
south
american
continent
assumed
an
acute
stage
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
and
afforded
to
this
government
occasion
to
express
the
hope
that
the
resort
to
arbitration
already
contemplated
by
existing
conventions
between
the
parties
might
prevail
despite
the
grave
difficulties
arising
in
its
application
i
am
happy
to
say
that
arrangements
to
this
end
have
been
perfected
the
questions
of
fact
upon
which
the
respective
commissioners
were
unable
to
agree
being
in
course
of
reference
to
her
britannic
majesty
for
determination
a
residual
difference
touching
the
northern
boundary
line
across
the
atacama
desert
for
which
existing
treaties
provided
no
adequate
adjustment
bids
fair
to
be
settled
in
like
manner
by
a
joint
commission
upon
which
the
united
states
minister
at
buenos
ayres
has
been
invited
to
serve
as
umpire
in
the
last
resort
i
have
found
occasion
to
approach
the
argentine
government
with
a
view
to
removing
differences
of
rate
charges
imposed
upon
the
cables
of
an
american
corporation
in
the
transmission
between
buenos
ayres
and
the
cities
of
uruguay
and
brazil
of
through
messages
passing
from
and
to
the
united
states
although
the
matter
is
complicated
by
exclusive
concessions
by
uruguay
and
brazil
to
foreign
companies
there
is
strong
hope
that
a
good
understanding
will
be
reached
and
that
the
important
channels
of
commercial
communication
between
the
united
states
and
the
atlantic
cities
of
south
america
may
be
freed
from
an
almost
prohibitory
discrimination
in
this
relation
i
may
be
permitted
to
express
my
sense
of
the
fitness
of
an
international
agreement
whereby
the
interchange
of
messages
over
connecting
cables
may
be
regulated
on
a
fair
basis
of
uniformity
the
world
has
seen
the
postal
system
developed
from
a
congeries
of
independent
and
exclusive
services
into
a
wellordered
union
of
which
all
countries
enjoy
the
manifold
benefits
it
would
be
strange
were
the
nations
not
in
time
brought
to
realize
that
modern
civilization
which
owes
so
much
of
its
progress
to
the
annihilation
of
space
by
the
electric
force
demands
that
this
allimportant
means
of
communication
be
a
heritage
of
all
peoples
to
be
administered
and
regulated
in
their
common
behoof
a
step
in
this
direction
was
taken
when
the
international
convention
of
for
the
protection
of
submarine
cables
was
signed
and
the
day
is
i
trust
not
far
distant
when
this
medium
for
the
transmission
of
thought
from
land
to
land
may
be
brought
within
the
domain
of
international
concert
as
completely
as
is
the
material
carriage
of
commerce
and
correspondence
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
that
divide
them
the
claim
of
thomas
jefferson
page
against
argentina
which
has
been
pending
many
years
has
been
adjusted
the
sum
awarded
by
the
congress
of

argentina
was
the
sympathy
of
the
american
people
has
justly
been
offered
to
the
ruler
and
the
people
of
austriahungary
by
reason
of
the
affliction
that
has
lately
befallen
them
in
the
assassination
of
the
empressqueen
of
that
historic
realm
on
the
th
of
september
a
conflict
took
place
at
lattimer
pa
between
a
body
of
striking
miners
and
the
sheriff
of
luzerne
county
and
his
deputies
in
which
miners
were
killed
and
wounded
of
whom
of
the
killed
and
of
the
wounded
were
austrian
and
hungarian
subjects
this
deplorable
event
naturally
aroused
the
solicitude
of
the
austrohungarian
government
which
on
the
assumption
that
the
killing
and
wounding
involved
the
unjustifiable
misuse
of
authority
claimed
reparation
for
the
sufferers
apart
from
the
searching
investigation
and
peremptory
action
of
the
authorities
of
pennsylvania
the
federal
executive
took
appropriate
steps
to
learn
the
merits
of
the
case
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
to
meet
the
urgent
complaint
of
a
friendly
power
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
having
been
indicted
for
murder
were
tried
and
acquitted
after
protracted
proceedings
and
the
hearing
of
hundreds
of
witnesses
on
the
ground
that
the
killing
was
in
the
line
of
their
official
duty
to
uphold
law
and
preserve
public
order
in
the
state
a
representative
of
the
department
of
justice
attended
the
trial
and
reported
its
course
fully
with
all
the
facts
in
its
possession
this
government
expects
to
reach
a
harmonious
understanding
on
the
subject
with
that
of
austriahungary
notwithstanding
the
renewed
claim
of
the
latter
after
learning
the
result
of
the
trial
for
indemnity
for
its
injured
subjects
despite
the
brief
time
allotted
for
preparation
the
exhibits
of
this
country
at
the
universal
exposition
at
brussels
in
enjoyed
the
singular
distinction
of
a
larger
proportion
of
awards
having
regard
to
the
number
and
classes
of
articles
entered
than
those
of
other
countries
the
worth
of
such
a
result
in
making
known
our
national
capacity
to
supply
the
worlds
markets
is
obvious
exhibitions
of
this
international
character
are
becoming
more
frequent
as
the
exchanges
of
commercial
countries
grow
more
intimate
and
varied
hardly
a
year
passes
that
this
government
is
not
invited
to
national
participation
at
some
important
foreign
center
but
often
on
too
short
notice
to
permit
of
recourse
to
congress
for
the
power
and
means
to
do
so
my
predecessors
have
suggested
the
advisability
of
providing
by
a
general
enactment
and
a
standing
appropriation
for
accepting
such
invitations
and
for
representation
of
this
country
by
a
commission
this
plan
has
my
cordial
approval
i
trust
that
the
belgian
restrictions
on
the
importation
of
cattle
from
the
united
states
originally
adopted
as
a
sanitary
precaution
will
at
an
early
day
be
relaxed
as
to
their
present
features
of
hardship
and
discrimination
so
as
to
admit
live
cattle
under
due
regulation
of
their
slaughter
after
landing
i
am
hopeful
too
of
favorable
change
in
the
belgian
treatment
of
our
preserved
and
salted
meats
the
growth
of
direct
trade
between
the
two
countries
not
alone
for
belgian
consumption
and
belgian
products
but
by
way
of
transit
from
and
to
other
continental
states
has
been
both
encouraging
and
beneficial
no
effort
will
be
spared
to
enlarge
its
advantages
by
seeking
the
removal
of
needless
impediments
and
by
arrangements
for
increased
commercial
exchanges
the
years
events
in
central
america
deserve
more
than
passing
mention
a
menacing
rupture
between
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
was
happily
composed
by
the
signature
of
a
convention
between
the
parties
with
the
concurrence
of
the
guatemalan
representative
as
a
mediator
the
act
being
negotiated
and
signed
on
board
the
united
states
steamer
alert
then
lying
in
central
american
waters
it
is
believed
that
the
good
offices
of
our
envoy
and
of
the
commander
of
that
vessel
contributed
toward
this
gratifying
outcome
in
my
last
annual
message
the
situation
was
presented
with
respect
to
the
diplomatic
representation
of
this
government
in
central
america
created
by
the
association
of
nicaragua
honduras
and
salvador
under
the
title
of
the
greater
republic
of
central
america
and
the
delegation
of
their
international
functions
to
the
diet
thereof
while
the
representative
character
of
the
diet
was
recognized
by
my
predecessor
and
has
been
confirmed
during
my
administration
by
receiving
its
accredited
envoy
and
granting
exequaturs
to
consuls
commissioned
under
its
authority
that
recognition
was
qualified
by
the
distinct
understanding
that
the
responsibility
of
each
of
the
component
sovereign
republics
toward
the
united
states
remained
wholly
unaffected
this
proviso
was
needful
inasmuch
as
the
compact
of
the
three
republics
was
at
the
outset
an
association
whereby
certain
representative
functions
were
delegated
to
a
tripartite
commission
rather
than
a
federation
possessing
centralized
powers
of
government
and
administration
in
this
view
of
their
relation
and
of
the
relation
of
the
united
states
to
the
several
republics
a
change
in
the
representation
of
this
country
in
central
america
was
neither
recommended
by
the
executive
nor
initiated
by
congress
thus
leaving
one
of
our
envoys
accredited
as
heretofore
separately
to
two
states
of
the
greater
republic
nicaragua
and
salvador
and
to
a
third
state
costa
rica
which
was
not
a
party
to
the
compact
while
our
other
envoy
was
similarly
accredited
to
a
union
state
honduras
and
a
nonunion
state
guatemala
the
result
has
been
that
the
one
has
presented
credentials
only
to
the
president
of
costa
rica
the
other
having
been
received
only
by
the
government
of
guatemala
subsequently
the
three
associated
republics
entered
into
negotiations
for
taking
the
steps
forecast
in
the
original
compact
a
convention
of
their
delegates
framed
for
them
a
federal
constitution
under
the
name
of
the
united
states
of
central
america
and
provided
for
a
central
federal
government
and
legislature
upon
ratification
by
the
constituent
states
the
st
of
november
last
was
fixed
for
the
new
system
to
go
into
operation
within
a
few
weeks
thereafter
the
plan
was
severely
tested
by
revolutionary
movements
arising
with
a
consequent
demand
for
unity
of
action
on
the
part
of
the
military
power
of
the
federal
states
to
suppress
them
under
this
strain
the
new
union
seems
to
have
been
weakened
through
the
withdrawal
of
its
more
important
members
this
government
was
not
officially
advised
of
the
installation
of
the
federation
and
has
maintained
an
attitude
of
friendly
expectancy
while
in
no
wise
relinquishing
the
position
held
from
the
outset
that
the
responsibilities
of
the
several
states
toward
us
remained
unaltered
by
their
tentative
relations
among
themselves
the
nicaragua
canal
commission
under
the
chairmanship
of
rearadmiral
john
g
walker
appointed
july
under
the
authority
of
a
provision
in
the
sundry
civil
act
of
june
of
that
year
has
nearly
completed
its
labors
and
the
results
of
its
exhaustive
inquiry
into
the
proper
route
the
feasibility
and
the
cost
of
construction
of
an
interoceanic
canal
by
a
nicaraguan
route
will
be
laid
before
you
in
the
performance
of
its
task
the
commission
received
all
possible
courtesy
and
assistance
from
the
governments
of
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
which
thus
testified
their
appreciation
of
the
importance
of
giving
a
speedy
and
practical
outcome
to
the
great
project
that
has
for
so
many
years
engrossed
the
attention
of
the
respective
countries
as
the
scope
of
the
recent
inquiry
embraced
the
whole
subject
with
the
aim
of
making
plans
and
surveys
for
a
canal
by
the
most
convenient
route
it
necessarily
included
a
review
of
the
results
of
previous
surveys
and
plans
and
in
particular
those
adopted
by
the
maritime
canal
company
under
its
existing
concessions
from
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
so
that
to
this
extent
those
grants
necessarily
hold
as
essential
a
part
in
the
deliberations
and
conclusions
of
the
canal
commission
as
they
have
held
and
must
needs
hold
in
the
discussion
of
the
matter
by
the
congress
under
these
circumstances
and
in
view
of
overtures
made
to
the
governments
of
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
by
other
parties
for
a
new
canal
concession
predicated
on
the
assumed
approaching
lapse
of
the
contracts
of
the
maritime
canal
company
with
those
states
i
have
not
hesitated
to
express
my
conviction
that
considerations
of
expediency
and
international
policy
as
between
the
several
governments
interested
in
the
construction
and
control
of
an
interoceanic
canal
by
this
route
require
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo
until
the
canal
commission
shall
have
reported
and
the
united
states
congress
shall
have
had
the
opportunity
to
pass
finally
upon
the
whole
matter
during
the
present
session
without
prejudice
by
reason
of
any
change
in
the
existing
conditions
nevertheless
it
appears
that
the
government
of
nicaragua
as
one
of
its
last
sovereign
acts
before
merging
its
powers
in
those
of
the
newly
formed
united
states
of
central
america
has
granted
an
optional
concession
to
another
association
to
become
effective
on
the
expiration
of
the
present
grant
it
does
not
appear
what
surveys
have
been
made
or
what
route
is
proposed
under
this
contingent
grant
so
that
an
examination
of
the
feasibility
of
its
plans
is
necessarily
not
embraced
in
the
report
of
the
canal
commission
all
these
circumstances
suggest
the
urgency
of
some
definite
action
by
the
congress
at
this
session
if
the
labors
of
the
past
are
to
be
utilized
and
the
linking
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
by
a
practical
waterway
is
to
be
realized
that
the
construction
of
such
a
maritime
highway
is
now
more
than
ever
indispensable
to
that
intimate
and
ready
intercommunication
between
our
eastern
and
western
seaboards
demanded
by
the
annexation
of
the
hawaiian
islands
and
the
prospective
expansion
of
our
influence
and
commerce
in
the
pacific
and
that
our
national
policy
now
more
imperatively
than
ever
calls
for
its
control
by
this
government
are
propositions
which
i
doubt
not
the
congress
will
duly
appreciate
and
wisely
act
upon
a
convention
providing
for
the
revival
o
f
the
late
united
states
and
chilean
claims
commission
and
the
consideration
of
claims
which
were
duly
presented
to
the
late
commission
but
not
considered
because
of
the
expiration
of
the
time
limited
for
the
duration
of
the
commission
was
signed
may
and
has
remained
unacted
upon
by
the
senate
the
term
therein
fixed
for
effecting
the
exchange
of
ratifications
having
elapsed
the
convention
falls
unless
the
time
be
extended
by
amendment
which
i
am
endeavoring
to
bring
about
with
the
friendly
concurrence
of
the
chilean
government
the
united
states
has
not
been
an
indifferent
spectator
of
the
extraordinary
events
transpiring
in
the
chinese
empire
whereby
portions
of
its
maritime
provinces
are
passing
under
the
control
of
various
european
powers
but
the
prospect
that
the
vast
commerce
which
the
energy
of
our
citizens
and
the
necessity
of
our
staple
productions
for
chinese
uses
has
built
up
in
those
regions
may
not
be
prejudiced
through
any
exclusive
treatment
by
the
new
occupants
has
obviated
the
need
of
our
country
becoming
an
actor
in
the
scene
our
position
among
nations
having
a
large
pacific
coast
and
a
constantly
expanding
direct
trade
with
the
farther
orient
gives
us
the
equitable
claim
to
consideration
and
friendly
treatment
in
this
regard
and
it
will
be
my
aim
to
subserve
our
large
interests
in
that
quarter
by
all
means
appropriate
to
the
constant
policy
of
our
government
the
territories
of
kiaochow
of
weihaiwei
and
of
port
arthur
and
talienwan
leased
to
germany
great
britain
and
russia
respectively
for
terms
of
years
will
it
is
announced
be
open
to
international
commerce
during
such
alien
occupation
and
if
no
discriminating
treatment
of
american
citizens
and
their
trade
be
found
to
exist
or
be
hereafter
developed
the
desire
of
this
government
would
appear
to
be
realized
in
this
relation
as
showing
the
volume
and
value
of
our
exchanges
with
china
and
the
peculiarly
favorable
conditions
which
exist
for
their
expansion
in
the
normal
course
of
trade
i
refer
to
the
communication
addressed
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
the
th
of
last
june
with
its
accompanying
letter
of
the
secretary
of
state
recommending
an
appropriation
for
a
commission
to
study
the
commercial
and
industrial
conditions
in

as
to
the
opportunities

and
obstacles
to
the
enlargement
of

action
was
not
taken
thereon
during
the
late
session
i
cordially
urge
that
the
recommendation
receive
at
your
hands
the
consideration
which
its
importance
and
timeliness
merit
meanwhile
there
may
be
just
ground
for
disquietude
in
view
of
the
unrest
and
revival
of
the
old
sentiment
of
opposition
and
prejudice
to
alien
people
which
pervades
certain
of
the
chinese
provinces

the
attacks

been
constrained
to
employ

upon

of
the
award
of
my
predecessor
as
arbitrator
of
the
claim
of
the
italian
subject
cerruti
against

differences
arose
between
the
parties
to
the
arbitration
in
regard
to
the
scope
and
extension
of
the
award
of
which
certain
articles
were
contested
by
colombia
while
italy
claimed
their
literal
fulfillment
the
award
having
been
made
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
an
act
of
friendly
consideration
and
with
the
sole
view
to
an
impartial
composition
of
the
matter
in
dispute
i
could
not
but
feel
deep
concern
at
such
a
miscarriage
and
while
unable
to
accept
the
colombian
theory
that
i
in
my
official
capacity
possessed
continuing
functions
as
arbitrator
with
power
to
interpret
or
revise
the
terms
of
the
award
my
best
efforts
were
lent
to
bring
the
parties
to
a
harmonious
agreement
as
to
the
execution
of
its
provisions
a
naval
demonstration
by
italy
resulted
in
an
engagement
to
pay
the
liabilities
claimed
upon
their
ascertainment
but
this
apparent
disposition
of
the
controversy
was
followed
by
a
rupture
of
diplomatic
intercourse
between
colombia
and
italy
which
still
continues
although
fortunately
without
acute
symptoms
having
supervened
notwithstanding
this
efforts
are
reported
to
be
continuing
for
the
ascertainment
of
colombias
contingent
liability
on
account
of

fifth
article
of
the
award

public
bridge
over
the
ozama
river
which
has

diplomatic
controversy

several
years

expert

about
it
however
remains
unpaid
despite
urgent
demands
for
its
settlement
according
to
the

is
now
every
prospect
that
the
participation

the
preliminary
report
of
mr

p

who
under

july
was
appointed
special
commissioner
with
a
view
to
securing
all
attainable
information
necessary
to
a
full
and
complete
understanding
by
congress
in
regard
to
the
participation
of
this
government
in
the
paris
exposition
was
laid
before
you
by
my
message
of
december
and
showed
the
large
opportunities
opened
to
make
known
our
national
progress
in
arts
science
and
manufactures
as
well
as
the
urgent
need
of
immediate
and
adequate
provision
to
enable
due
advantage
thereof
to
be
taken
mr
handys
death
soon
afterwards
rendered
it
necessary
for
another
to
take
up
and
complete
his
unfinished
work
and
on
january
last
mr
thomas
w
cridler
third
assistant
secretary
of
state
was
designated
to
fulfill
that
task
his
report
was
laid
before
you
by
my
message
of
june
with
the
gratifying
result
of
awakening
renewed
interest
in
the
projected
display
by
a
provision
in
the
sundry
civil
appropriation
act
of
july
a
sum
not
to
exceed
was
allotted
for
the
organization
of
a
commission
to
care
for
the
proper
preparation
and
installation
of
american
exhibits
and
for
the
display
of
suitable
exhibits
by
the
several
executive
departments
particularly
by
the
department
of
agriculture
the
fish
commission
and
the
smithsonian
institution
in
representation
of
the
government
of
the
united

appointed
mr

peck
of
chicago
commissionergeneral
with
an
assistant
commissionergeneral
and
a
secretary
mr
peck
at
once
proceeded
to
paris
where
his
success
in
enlarging
the
scope
and
variety
of
the

has
been
most
gratifying
notwithstanding
the
comparatively
limited
area

space
assigned
to

has
been
increased
from
the
absolute
allotment
of
square
feet
reported
by
mr
handy
to
some
square
feet
with
corresponding
augmentation
of
the
field
for
a
truly
characteristic
representation
of
the
various
important
branches
of
our
countrys
development
mr
pecks
report
will
be
laid
before
you
in
my
judgment
its
recommendations
will
call
for
your
early
consideration
especially
as
regards
an
increase
of
the
appropriation
to
at
least
one
million
dollars
in
all
so
that
not
only
may
the
assigned
space
be
fully
taken
up
by
the
best
possible
exhibits
in
every
class
but
the
preparation
and
installation
be
on
so
perfect
a
scale
as
to
rank
among
the
first
in
that
unparalleled
competition
of
artistic
and
inventive
production
and
thus
counterbalance
the
disadvantage
with
which
we
start
as
compared
with
other
countries
whose
appropriations
are
on
a
more
generous
scale
and
whose
preparations
are
in
a
state
of
much
greater
forwardness
than
our
own
where
our
artisans
have
the
admitted
capacity
to
excel
where
our
inventive
genius
has
initiated
many
of
the
grandest
discoveries
of
these
later
days
of
the
century
and
where
the
native
resources
of
our
land
are
as
limitless
as
they
are
valuable
to
supply
the
worlds
needs
it
is
our
province
as
it
should
be
our
earnest
care
to
lead
in
the
march
of
human
progress
and
not
rest
content
with
any
secondary
place
moreover
if
this
be
due
to
ourselves
it
is
no
less
due
to
the
great
french
nation
whose
guests
we
become
and
which
has
in
so
many
ways
testified
its
wish
and
hope
that
our
participation
shall
befit
the
place
the
two
peoples
have
won
in
the
field
of
universal
development
the
commercial
arrangement
made
with
france
on
the
th
of
may
under
the
provisions
of
section
of
the
tariff
act
of
went
into
effect
on
the
st
day
of
june
following
it
has
relieved
a
portion
of
our
export
trade
from
serious
embarrassment
further
negotiations
are
now
pending
under
section
of
the
same
act
with
a
view
to
the
increase
of
trade
between
the
two
countries
to
their
mutual
advantage
negotiations
with
other
governments
in
part
interrupted
by
the
war
with
spain
are
in
progress
under
both
sections
of
the
tariff
act
i
hope
to
be
able
to
announce
some
of
the
results
of
these
negotiations
during
the
present
session
of
congress
negotiations
to
the
same
end
with
germany
have
been
set
on
foot
meanwhile
no
effort
has
been
relaxed
to
convince
the
imperial
government
of
the
thoroughness
of
our
inspection
of
pork
products
for
exportation
and
it
is
trusted
that
the
efficient
administration
of
this
measure
by
the
department
of
agriculture
will
be
recognized
as
a
guaranty
of
the
healthfulness
of
the
food
staples
we
send
abroad
to
countries
w
here
their
use
is
large
and
necessary
i
transmitted
to
the
senate
on
the
th
of
february
last
information
touching
the
prohibition
against
the
importation
of
fresh
fruits
from
this
country
which
had
then
recently
been
decreed
by
germany
on
the
ground
of
danger
of
disseminating
the
san
jose
scale
insect
this
precautionary
measure
was
justified
by
germany
on
the
score
of
the
drastic
steps
taken
in
several
states
of
the
union
against
the
spread
of
the
pest
the
elaborate
reports
of
the
department
of
agriculture
being
put
in
evidence
to
show
the
danger
to
german
fruitgrowing
interests
should
the
scale
obtain
a
lodgment
in
that
country
temporary
relief
was
afforded
in
the
case
of
large
consignments
of
fruit
then
on
the
way
by
inspection
and
admission
when
found
noninfected
later
the
prohibition
was
extended
to
dried
fruits
of
every
kind
but
was
relaxed
so
as
to
apply
only
to
unpeeled
fruit
and
fruit
waste
as
was
to
be
expected
the
alarm
reached
to
other
countries
and
switzerland
has
adopted
a
similar
inhibition
efforts
are
in
progress
to
induce
the
german
and
swiss
governments
to
relax
the
prohibition
in
favor
of
dried
fruits
shown
to
have
been
cured
under
circumstances
rendering
the
existence
of
animal
life
impossible
our
relations
with
great
britain
have
continued
on
the
most
friendly
footing
assenting
to
our
request
the
protection
of
americans
and
their
interests
in
spanish
jurisdiction
was
assumed
by
the
diplomatic
and
consular
representatives
of
great
britain
who
fulfilled
their
delicate
and
arduous
trust
with
tact
and
zeal
eliciting
high
commendation
i
may
be
allowed
to
make
fitting
allusion
to
the
instance
of
mr
ramsden
her
majestys
consul
at
santiago
de
cuba
whose
untimely
death
after
distinguished
service
and
untiring
effort
during
the
siege
of
that
city
was
sincerely
lamented
in
the
early
part
of
april
last
pursuant
to
a
request
made
at
the
instance
of
the
secretary
of
state
by
the
british
ambassador
at
this
capital
the
canadian
government
granted
facilities
for
the
passage
of
four
united
states
revenue
cutters
from
the
great
lakes
to
the
atlantic
coast
by
way
of
the
canadian
canals
and
the
st
lawrence
river
the
vessels
had
reached
lake
ontario
and
were
there
awaiting
the
opening
of
navigation
when
war
was
declared
between
the
united
states
and
spain
her
majestys
government
thereupon
by
a
communication
of
the
latter
part
of
april
stated
that
the
permission
granted
before
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
would
not
be
withdrawn
provided
the
united
states
government
gave
assurance
that
the
vessels
in
question
would
proceed
direct
to
a
united
states
port
without
engaging
in
any
hostile
operation
this
government
promptly
agreed
to
the
stipulated
condition
it
being
understood
that
the
vessels
would
not
be
prohibited
from
resisting
any
hostile
attack
it
will
give
me
especial
satisfaction
if
i
shall
be
authorized
to
communicate
to
you
a
favorable
conclusion
of
the
pending
negotiations
with
great
britain
in
respect
to
the
dominion
of
canada
it
is
the
earnest
wish
of
this
government
to
remove
all
sources
of
discord
and
irritation
in
our
relations
with
the
neighboring
dominion
the
trade
between
the
two
countries
is
constantly
increasing
and
it
is
important
to
both
countries
that
all
reasonable
facilities
should
be
granted
for
its
development
the
government
of
greece
strongly
urges
the
onerousness
of
the
duty
here
imposed
upon
the
currants
of
that
country
amounting
to
per
cent
or
more
of
their
market
value
this
fruit
is
stated
to
be
exclusively
a
greek
product
not
coming
into
competition
with
any
domestic
product
the
question
of
reciprocal
commercial
relations
with
greece
including
the
restoration
of
currants
to
the
free
list
is
under
consideration
the
longstanding
claim
of
bernard
campbell
for
damages
for
injuries
sustained
from
a
violent
assault
committed
against
him
by
military
authorities
in
the
island
of
haiti
has
been
settled
by
the
agreement
of
that
republic
to
pay
him
in
american
gold
of
this
sum
has
already
been
paid
it
is
hoped
that
other
pending
claims
of
american
citizens
against
that
republic
may
be
amicably
adjusted
pending
the
consideration
by
the
senate
of
the
treaty
signed
june
by
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
republic
of
hawaii
providing
for
the
annexation
of
the
islands
a
joint
resolution
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
by
accepting
the
offered
cession
and
incorporating
the
ceded
territory
into
the
union
was
adopted
by
the
congress
and
approved
july
i
thereupon
directed
the
united
states
steamship
philadelphia
to
convey
rearadmiral
miller
to
honolulu
and
intrusted
to
his
hands
this
important
legislative
act
to
be
delivered
to
the
president
of
the
republic
of
hawaii
with
whom
the
admiral
and
the
united
states
minister
were
authorized
to
make
appropriate
arrangements
for
transferring
the
sovereignty
of
the
islands
to
the
united
states
this
was
simply
but
impressively
accomplished
on
the
th
of
august
last
by
the
delivery
of
a
certified
copy
of
the
resolution
to
president
dole
who
thereupon
yielded
up
to
the
representative
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
sovereignty
and
public
property
of
the
hawaiian
islands
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
joint
resolution
and
in
exercise
of
the
authority
thereby
conferred
upon
me
i
directed
that
the
civil
judicial
and
military
powers
theretofore
exercised
by
the
officers
of
the
government
of
the
republic
of
hawaii
should
continue
to
be
exercised
by
those
officers
until
congress
shall
provide
a
government
for
the
incorporated
territory
subject
to
my
power
to
remove
such
officers
and
to
fill
vacancies
the
president
officers
and
troops
of
the
republic
thereupon
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
thus
providing
for
the
uninterrupted
continuance
of
all
the
administrative
and
municipal
functions
of
the
annexed
territory
until
congress
shall
otherwise
enact
following
the
further
provision
of
the
joint
resolution
i
appointed
the
hons
shelby
m
cullom
of
illinois
john
t
morgan
of
alabama
robert
r
hitt
of
illinois
sanford
b
dole
of
hawaii
and
walter
f
frear
of
hawaii
as
commissioners
to
confer
and
recommend
to
congress
such
legislation
concerning
the
hawaiian
islands
as
they
should
deem
necessary
or
proper
the
commissioners
having
fulfilled
the
mission
confided
to
them
their
report
will
be
laid
before
you
at
an
early
day
it
is
believed
that
their
recommendations
will
have
the
earnest
consideration
due
to
the
magnitude
of
the
responsibility
resting
upon
you
to
give
such
shape
to
the
relationship
of
those
midpacific
lands
to
our
home
union
as
will
benefit
both
in
the
highest
degree
realizing
the
aspirations
of
the
community
that
has
cast
its
lot
with
us
and
elected
to
share
our
political
heritage
while
at
the
same
time
justifying
the
foresight
of
those
who
for
threequarters
of
a
century
have
looked
to
the
assimilation
of
hawaii
as
a
natural
and
inevitable
consummation
in
harmony
with
our
needs
and
in
fulfillment
of
our
cherished
traditions
the
questions
heretofore
pending
between
hawaii
and
japan
growing
out
of
the
alleged
mistreatment
of
japanese
treaty
immigrants
were
i
am
pleased
to
say
adjusted
before
the
act
of
transfer
by
the
payment
of
a
reasonable
indemnity
to
the
government
of
japan
under
the
provisions
of
the
joint
resolution
the
existing
customs
relations
of
the
hawaiian
islands
with
the
united
states
and
with
other
countries
remain
unchanged
until
legislation
shall
otherwise
provide
the
consuls
of
hawaii
here
and
in
foreign
countries
continue
to
fulfill
their
commercial
agencies
while
the
united
states
consulate
at
honolulu
is
maintained
for
all
appropriate
services
pertaining
to
trade
and
the
revenue
it
would
be
desirable
that
all
foreign
consuls
in
the
hawaiian
islands
should
receive
new
exequaturs
from
this
government
the
attention
of
congress
is
called
to
the
fact
that
our
consular
offices
having
ceased
to
exist
in
hawaii
and
being
about
to
cease
in
other
countries
coming
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
the
provisions
for
the
relief
and
transportation
of
destitute
american
seamen
in
these
countries
under
our
consular
regulations
will
in
consequence
terminate
it
is
proper
therefore
that
new
legislation
should
be
enacted
upon
this
subject
in
order
to
meet
the
changed
conditions
the
interpretation
of
certain
provisions
of
the
extradition
convention
of
december
has
been
at
various
times
the
occasion
of
controversy
with
the
government
of
mexico
an
acute
difference
arose
in
the
case
of
the
mexican
demand
for
the
delivery
of
jesus
guerra
who
having
led
a
marauding
expedition
near
the
border
with
the
proclaimed
purpose
of
initiating
an
insurrection
against
president
diaz
escaped
into
texas
extradition
was
refused
on
the
ground
that
the
alleged
offense
was
political
in
its
character
and
therefore
came
within
the
treaty
proviso
of
nonsurrender
the
mexican
contention
was
that
the
exception
only
related
to
purely
political
offenses
and
that
as
guerras
acts
were
admixed
with
the
common
crime
of
murder
arson
kidnaping
and
robbery
the
option
of
nondelivery
became
void
a
position
which
this
government
was
unable
to
admit
in
view
of
the
received
international
doctrine
and
practice
in
the
matter
the
mexican
government
in
view
of
this
gave
notice
january
of
the
termination
of
the
convention
to
take
effect
twelve
months
from
that
date
at
the
same
time
inviting
the
conclusion
of
a
new
convention
toward
which
negotiations
are
on
foot
in
this
relation
i
may
refer
to
the
necessity
of
some
amendment
of
our
existing
extradition
statute
it
is
a
common
stipulation
of
such
treaties
that
neither
party
shall
be
bound
to
give
up
its
own
citizens
with
the
added
proviso
in
one
of
our
treaties
that
with
japan
that
it
may
surrender
if
it
see
fit
it
is
held
in
this
country
by
an
almost
uniform
course
of
decisions
that
where
a
treaty
negatives
the
obligation
to
surrender
the
president
is
not
invested
with
legal
authority
to
act
the
conferment
of
such
authority
would
be
in
the
line
of
that
sound
morality
which
shrinks
from
affording
secure
asylum
to
th
e
author
of
a
heinous
crime
again
statutory
provision
might
well
be
made
for
what
is
styled
extradition
by
way
of
transit
whereby
a
fugitive
surrendered
by
one
foreign
government
to
another
may
be
conveyed
across
the
territory
of
the
united
states
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
demanding
state
a
recommendation
in
this
behalf
made
in
the
presidents
message
of
was
not
acted
upon
the
matter
is
presented
for
your
consideration
the
problem
of
the
mexican
free
zone
has
been
often
discussed
with
regard
to
its
inconvenience
as
a
provocative
of
smuggling
into
the
united
states
along
an
extensive
and
thinly
guarded
land
border
the
effort
made
by
the
joint
resolution
of
march
to
remedy
the
abuse
charged
by
suspending
the
privilege
of
free
transportation
in
bond
across
the
territory
of
the
united
states
to
mexico
failed
of
good
result
as
is
stated
in
report
no
of
the
house
of
representatives
submitted
in
the
last
session
march
as
the
question
is
one
to
be
conveniently
met
by
wise
concurrent
legislation
of
the
two
countries
looking
to
the
protection
of
the
revenues
by
harmonious
measures
operating
equally
on
either
side
of
the
boundary
rather
than
by
conventional
arrangements
i
suggest
that
congress
consider
the
advisability
of
authorizing
and
inviting
a
conference
of
representatives
of
the
treasury
departments
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
to
consider
the
subject
in
all
its
complex
bearings
and
make
report
with
pertinent
recommendations
to
the
respective
governments
for
the
information
and
consideration
of
their
congresses
the
mexican
water
boundary
commission
has
adjusted
all
matters
submitted
to
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
governments
save
in
three
important
casesthat
of
the
chamizal
at
el
paso
tex
where
the
two
commissioners
failed
to
agree
and
wherein
for
this
case
only
this
government
has
proposed
to
mexico
the
addition
of
a
third
member
the
proposed
elimination
of
what
are
known
as
bancos
small
isolated
islands
formed
by
the
cutting
off
of
bends
in
the
rio
grande
from
the
operation
of
the
treaties
of
and
recommended
by
the
commissioners
and
approved
by
this
government
but
still
under
consideration
by
mexico
and
the
subject
of
the
equitable
distribution
of
the
waters
of
the
rio
grande
for
which
the
commissioners
recommended
an
international
dam
and
reservoir
approved
by
mexico
but
still
under
consideration
by
this
government
pending
these
questions
it
is
necessary
to
extend
the
life
of
the
commission
which
expires
december
next
the
coronation
of
the
young
queen
of
the
netherlands
was
made
the
occasion
of
fitting
congratulations
the
claim
of
victor
h
mccord
against
peru
which
for
a
number
of
years
has
been
pressed
by
this
government
and
has
on
several
occasions
attracted
the
attention
of
the
congress
has
been
satisfactorily
adjusted
a
protocol
was
signed
may
whereby
the
fact
of
liability
being
admitted
the
question
of
the
amount
to
be
awarded
was
submitted
to
the
chief
justice
of
canada
as
sole
arbitrator
his
award
sets
the
indemnity
due
the
claimant
at
the
government
of
peru
has
given
the
prescribed
notification
of
its
intention
to
abrogate
the
treaty
of
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
concluded
with
this
country
august
as
that
treaty
contains
many
important
provisions
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
commerce
and
good
relations
which
could
with
difficulty
be
replaced
by
the
negotiation
of
renewed
provisions
within
the
brief
twelve
months
intervening
before
the
treaty
terminates
i
have
invited
suggestions
by
peru
as
to
the
particular
provisions
it
is
desired
to
annul
in
the
hope
of
reaching
an
arrangement
whereby
the
remaining
articles
may
be
provisionally
saved
his
majesty
the
czar
having
announced
his
purpose
to
raise
the
imperial
russian
mission
at
this
capital
to
the
rank
of
an
embassy
i
responded
under
the
authority
conferred
by
the
act
of
march
by
commissioning
and
accrediting
the
actual
representative
at
st
petersburg
in
the
capacity
of
ambassador
extraordinary
and
plenipotentiary
the
russian
ambassador
to
this
country
has
since
presented
his
credentials
the
proposal
of
the
czar
for
a
general
reduction
of
the
vast
military
establishments
that
weigh
so
heavily
upon
many
peoples
in
time
of
peace
was
communicated
to
this
government
with
an
earnest
invitation
to
be
represented
in
the
conference
which
it
is
contemplated
to
assemble
with
a
view
to
discussing
the
means
of
accomplishing
so
desirable
a
result
his
majesty
was
at
once
informed
of
the
cordial
sympathy
of
this
government
with
the
principle
involved
in
his
exalted
proposal
and
of
the
readiness
of
the
united
states
to
take
part
in
the
conference
the
active
military
force
of
the
united
states
as
measured
by
our
population
territorial
area
and
taxable
wealth
is
and
under
any
conceivable
prospective
conditions
must
continue
to
be
in
time
of
peace
so
conspicuously
less
than
that
of
the
armed
powers
to
whom
the
czars
appeal
is
especially
addressed
that
the
question
can
have
for
us
no
practical
importance
save
as
marking
an
auspicious
step
toward
the
betterment
of
the
condition
of
the
modern
peoples
and
the
cultivation
of
peace
and
good
will
among
them
but
in
this
view
it
behooves
us
as
a
nation
to
lend
countenance
and
aid
to
the
beneficent
project
the
claims
of
owners
of
american
sealing
vessels
for
seizure
by
russian
cruisers
in
bering
sea
are
being
pressed
to
a
settlement
the
equities
of
the
cases
justify
the
expectation
that
a
measure
of
reparation
will
eventually
be
accorded
in
harmony
with
precedent
and
in
the
light
of
the
proven
facts
the
recommendation
made
in
my
special
message
of
april
last
is
renewed
that
appropriation
be
made
to
reimburse
the
master
and
owners
of
the
russian
bark
hans
for
wrongful
arrest
of
the
master
and
detention
of
the
vessel
in
february
by
officers
of

united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
the
papers
accompanying
my
said
message
make
out
a
most
meritorious
claim
and
justify
the
urgency
with
which
it
has
been
presented
by
the
government
of
russia
malietoa
laupepa
king
of

will
add
to
the
undesirable
complications
which
the
execution
of
the
tripartite
general
act
has
heretofore
developed
remains
to
be
seen
the
efforts
of
this
government
will
as
heretofore
be
addressed
toward
a
harmonious
and
exact
fulfillment
of
the
terms
of
the
international
engagement
to
which
the
united
states
became
a
party
in
the

claim
against

an

has
been
accredited
to

and
has
presented
his
credentials
immediately
upon
the
outbreak
of
the

with

the
swiss
government
fulfilling
the
high
mission
it
has
deservedly
assumed
as
the
patron
of
the
international
red
cross
proposed
to
the
united
states
and
spain
that
they
should
severally
recognize
and
carry
into
execution
as
a
modus
vivendi
during
the
continuance
of
hostilities
the
additional
articles
proposed
by
the
international
conference
of
geneva
october
extending
the
effects
of
the
existing
red
cross
convention
of
to
the
conduct
of
naval
war
following
the
example
set
by
france
and
germany
in
in
adopting
such
a
modus
vivendi
and
in

of
the
accession
of
the
united
states
to
those
additional
articles
in
although
the
exchange
of
ratifications
thereof
still
remained
uneffected
the
swiss
proposal
was
promptly
and
cordially
accepted
by
us
and
simultaneously
by
spain
this
government
feels
a
keen
satisfaction
in
having
thus
been
enabled
to
testify
its
adherence
to
the
broadest
principles
of
humanity
even
amidst
the
clash
of
war
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
extension
of
the
red
cross
compact
to
hostilities
by
sea
as
well
as
on
land
may
soon
become
an
accomplished
fact
through
the
general
promulgation
of
the
additional
naval
red
cross
articles
by
the
maritime
powers
now
parties
to
the
convention
of
the
important
question
of
the
claim
of
switzerland
to
the
perpetual
cantonal
allegiance
of
american
citizens
of
swiss
origin
has
not
made
hopeful
progress
toward
a
solution
and
controversies
in
this
regard
still
continue
the
newly
accredited
envoy
of
the
united
states
to
the
ottoman
porte
carries
instructions
looking
to
the
disposal
of
matters
in
controversy
with
turkey
for
a
number
of
years
he
is
especially
charged
to
press
for
a
just
settlement
of
our
claims
for
indemnity
by
reason
of
the
destruction
of
the
property
of
american
missionaries
resident
in
that
country
during
the
armenian
troubles
of
as
well
as
for
the
recognition
of
older
claims
of
equal
justness
he
is
also
instructed
to
seek
an
adjustment
of
the
dispute
growing
out
of
the
refusal
of
turkey
to
recognize
the
acquired
citizenship
of
ottomanborn
persons
naturalized
in
the
united
states
since
without
prior
imperial
consent
and
in
the
same
general
relation
he
is
directed
to
endeavor
to
bring
about
a
solution
of
the
question
which
has
more
or
less
acutely
existed
since
concerning
the
jurisdictional
rights
of
the
united
states
in
matters
of
criminal
procedure
and
punishment
under
article
iv
of
the
treaty
of
this
latter
difficulty
grows
out
of
a
verbal
difference
claimed
by
turkey
to
be
essential
between
the
original
turkish
text
and
the
promulgated
translation
after
more
than
two
years
from
the
appointment
of
a
consul
of
this
country
to
erzerum
he
has
received
his
exequatur
the
arbitral
tribunal
appointed
under
the

treaty
of

between

and

to
determine
the
boundary
line
between
the
latter
and
the
colony
of
british
guiana
is
to
convene
at
paris
during
the
present
month
it
is
a
source
of
much
gratification
to
this
government
to
see
the
friendly
resort
of
arbitration
applied
to
the
settlement
of
this
controversy
not
alone
because
of
the
earnest
part
we
have
had
in
bringing
about
the
result
but
also
because
the
two
members
named
on
behalf
of
venezuela
mr
chief
justice
fuller
and
mr
justice
brewer
chosen
from
our
highest
court
appropriately
testify
the
continuing
interest
we
feel
in
the
definitive
adjustment
of
the
question
according
to
the
strictest
rules
of
justice
the
british
members
lord
herschell
and
sir
richard
collins
are
jurists
of
no
less
exalted
repute
while
the
fifth
member
and
president
of
the
tribunal
m
f
de
martens
has
earned
a
worldwide
reputation
as
an
authority
upon
international
law
the
claim
of
felipe
scandella
against
venezuela
for
arbitrary
expulsion
and
injury
to
his
business
has
been
adjusted
by
the
revocation
of
the
order
of
expulsion
and
by
the
payment
of
the
sum
of
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
state
that
the
bureau
of
the
american
republics
created
in
as
the
organ
for
promoting
commercial
intercourse
and
fraternal
relations
among
the
countries
of
the
western
hemisphere
has
become
a
more
efficient
instrument
of
the
wise
purposes
of
its
founders
and
is
receiving
the
cordial
support
of
the
contributing
members
of
the
international
union
which
are
actually
represented
in
its
board
of
management
a
commercial
directory
in
two
volumes
containing
a
mass
of
statistical
matter
descriptive
of
the
industrial
and
commercial
interests
of
the
various
countries
has
been
printed
in
english
spanish
portuguese
and
french
and
a
monthly
bulletin
published
in
these
four
languages
and
distributed
in
the
latinamerican
countries
as
well
as
in
the
united
states
has
proved
to
be
a
valuable
medium
for
disseminating
information
and
furthering
the
varied
interests
of
the
international
union
during
the
past
year
the
important
work
of
collecting
information
of
practical
benefit
to
american
industries
and
trade
through
the
agency
of
the
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
has
been
steadily
advanced
and
in
order
to
lay
such
data
before
the
public
with
the
least
delay
the
practice
was
begun
in
january
of
issuing
the
commercial
reports
from
day
to
day
as
they
are
received
by
the
department
of
state
it
is
believed
that
for
promptitude
as
well
as
fullness
of
information
the
service
thus
supplied
to
our
merchants
and
manufacturers
will
be
found
to
show
sensible
improvement
and
to
merit
the
liberal
support
of
congress
the
experiences
of
the
last
year
bring
forcibly
home
to
us
a
sense
of
the
burdens
and
the
waste
of
war
we
desire
in
common
with
most
civilized
nations
to
reduce
to
the
lowest
possible
point
the
damage
sustained
in
time
of
war
by
peaceable
trade
and
commerce
it
is
true
we
may
suffer
in
such
cases
less
than
other
communities
but
all
nations
are
damaged
more
or
less
by
the
state
of
uneasiness
and
apprehension
into
which
an
outbreak
of
hostilities
throws
the
entire
commercial
world
it
should
be
our
object
therefore
to
minimize
so
far
as
practicable
this
inevitable
loss
and
disturbance
this
purpose
can
probably
best
be
accomplished
by
an
international
agreement
to
regard
all
private
property
at
sea
as
exempt
from
capture
or
destruction
by
the
forces
of
belligerent
powers
the
united
states
government
has
for
many
years
advocated
this
humane
and
beneficent
principle
and
is
now
in
position
to
recommend
it
to
other
powers
without
the
imputation
of
selfish
motives
i
therefore
suggest
for
your
consideration
that
the
executive
be
authorized
to
correspond
with
the
governments
of
the
principal
maritime
powers
with
a
view
of
incorporating
into
the
permanent
law
of
civilized
nations
the
principle
of
the
exemption
of
all
private
property
at
sea
not
contraband
of
war
from
capture
or
destruction
by
belligerent
powers
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
reports
that
the
receipts
of
the
government
from
all
sources
during
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
including
received
from
sale
of
pacific
railroads
amounted
to
and
its
expenditures
to
there
was
collected
from
customs
and
from
internal
revenue
our
dutiable
imports
amounted
to
a
decrease
of
over
the
preceding
year
and
importations
free
of
duty
amounted
to
a
decrease
from
the
preceding
year
of
internalrevenue
receipts
exceeded
those
of
the
preceding
year
by
the
total
tax
collected
on
distilled
spirits
was
on
manufactured
tobacco
and
on
fermented
liquors
we
exported
merchandise
during
the
year
amounting
to
an
increase
of
from
the
preceding
year
it
is
estimated
upon
the
basis
of
present
revenue
laws
that
the
receipts
of
the
government
for
the
year
ending
june
will
be
and
its
expenditures
resulting
in
a
deficiency
of
on
the
st
of
december
there
was
held
in
the
treasury
gold
coin
amounting
to
gold
bullion
amounting
to
silver
bullion
amounting
to
and
other
forms
of
money
amounting
to
on
the
same
date
the
amount
of
money
of
all
kinds
in
circulation
or
not
included
in
treasury
holdings
was
an
increase
for
the
year
of
estimating
our
population
at
at
the
time
mentioned
the
per
capita
circulation
was
on
the
same
date
there
was
in
the
treasury
gold
bullion
amounting
to
the
provisions
made
for
strengthening
the
resources
of
the
treasury
in
connection
with
the
war
have
given
increased
confidence
in
the
purpose
and
power
of
the
government
to
maintain
the
present
standard
and
have
established
more
firmly
than
ever
the
national
credit
at
home
and
abroad
a
marked
evidence
of
this
is
found
in
the
inflow
of
gold
to
the
treasury
its
net
gold
holdings
on
november
were
as
compared
with
on
november
and
an
increase
of
net
cash
of
november
to
november
the
present
ratio
of
net
treasury
gold
to
outstanding
government
liabilities
including
united
states
notes
treasury
notes
of
silver
certificates
currency
certificates
standard
silver
dollars
and
fractional
silver
coin
november
was
per
cent
as
compared
with
per
cent
november
i
renew
so
much
of
my
recommendation
of
december
as
follows
that
when
any
of
the
united
states
notes
are
presented
for
redemption
in
gold
and
are
redeemed
in
gold
such
notes
shall
be
kept
and
set
apart
and
only
paid
out
in
exchange
for
gold
this
is
an
obvious
duty
if
the
holder
of
the
united
states
note
prefers
the
gold
and
gets
it
from
the
government
he
should
not
receive
back
from
the
government
a
united
states
note
without
paying
gold
in
exchange
for
it
the
reason
for
this
is
made
all
the
more
apparent
when
the
government
issues
an
interestbearing
debt
to
provide
gold
for
the
redemption
of
united
states
notesa
noninterestbearing
debt
surely
it
should
not
pay
them
out
again
except
on
demand
and
for
gold
if
they
are
put
out
in
any
other
way
they
may
return
again
to
he
followed
by
another
bond
issue
to
redeem
themanother
interestbearing
debt
to
redeem
a
noninterestbearing
debt
this
recommendation
was
made
in
the
belief
that
such
provisions
of
law
would
insure
to
a
greater
degree
the
safety
of
the
present
standard
and
better
protect
our
currency
from
the
dangers
to
which
it
is
subjected
from
a
disturbance
in
the
general
business
conditions
of
the
country
in
my
judgment
the
present
condition
of
the
treasury
amply
justifies
the
immediate
enactment
of
the
legislation
recommended
one
year
ago
under
which
a
portion
of
the
gold
holdings
should
be
placed
in
a
trust
fund
from
which
greenbacks
should
be
redeemed
upon
presentation
but
when
once
redeemed
should
not
thereafter
be
paid
out
except
for
gold
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
other
legislation
relating
to
our
currency
is
not
required
on
the
contrary
there
is
an
obvious
demand
for
it
the
importance
of
adequate
provision
which
will
insure
to
our
future
a
money
standard
related
as
our
money
standard
now
is
to
that
of
our
commercial
rivals
is
generally
recognized
the
companion
proposition
that
our
domestic
paper
currency
shall
be
kept
safe
and
yet
be
so
related
to
the
needs
of
our
industries
and
internal
commerce
as
to
be
adequate
and
responsive
to
such
needs
is
a
proposition
scarcely
less
important
the
subject
in
all
its
parts
is
commended
to
the
wise
consideration
of
the
congress
the
annexation
of
hawaii
and
the
changed
relations
of
the
united
states
to
cuba
puerto
rico
and
the
philippines
resulting
from
the
war
compel
the
prompt
adoption
of
a
maritime
policy
by
the
united
states
there
should
be
established
regular
and
frequent
steamship
communication
encouraged
by
the
united
states
under
the
american
flag
with
the
newly
acquired
islands
spain
furnished
to
its
colonies
at
an
annual
cost
of
about
steamship
lines
communicating
with
a
portion
of
the
worlds
markets
as
well
as
with
trade
centers
of
the
home
government
the
united
states
will
not
undertake
to
do
less
it
is
our
duty
to
furnish
the
people
of
hawaii
with
facilities
under
national
control
for
their
export
and
import
trade
it
will
be
conceded
that
the
present
situation
calls
for
legislation
which
shall
be
prompt
durable
and
liberal
the
part
which
american
merchant
vessels
and
their
seamen
performed
in
the
war
with
spain
demonstrates
that
this
service
furnishing
both
pickets
and
the
second
line
of
defense
is
a
national
necessity
and
should
be
encouraged
in
every
constitutional
way
details
and
methods
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
purpose
are
discussed
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
which
the
attention
of
congress
is
respectfully
invited
in
my
last
annual
message
i
recommended
that
congress
authorize
the
appointment
of
a
commission
for
the
purpose
of
making
systematic
investigations
with
reference
to
the
cause
and
prevention
of
yellow
fever
this
matter
has
acquired
an
increased
importance
as
a
result
of
the
military
occupation
of
the
island
of
cuba
and
the
commercial
intercourse
between
this
island
and
the
united
states
which
we
have
every
reason
to
expect
the
sanitary
problems
connected
with
our
new
relations
with
the
island
of
cuba
and
the
acquisition
of
pu
erto
rico
are
no
less
important
than
those
relating
to
finance
commerce
and
administration
it
is
my
earnest
desire
that
these
problems
may
be
considered
by
competent
experts
and
that
everything
may
be
done
which
the
most
recent
advances
in
sanitary
science
can
offer
for
the
protection
of
the
health
of
our
soldiers
in
those
islands
and
of
our
citizens
who
are
exposed
to
the
dangers
of
infection
from
the
importation
of
yellow
fever
i
therefore
renew
my
recommendation
that
the
authority
of
congress
may
be
given
and
a
suitable
appropriation
made
to
provide
for
a
commission
of
experts
to
be
appointed
for
the
purpose
indicated
under
the
act
of
congress
approved
april
authorizing
the
president
in
his
discretion
upon
a
declaration
of
war
by
congress
or
a
declaration
by
congress
that
war
exists
i
directed
the
increase
of
the
regular
army
to
the
maximum
of
authorized
in
said
act
there
are
now
in
the
regular
army
officers
and
men
in
said
act
it
was
provided
that
at
the
end
of
any
war
in
which
the
united
states
may
become
involved
the
army
shall
be
reduced
to
a
peace
basis
by
the
transfer
in
the
same
arm
of
the
service
or
absorption
by
promotion
or
honorable
discharge
under
such
regulations
as
the
secretary
of
war
may
establish
of
supernumerary
commissioned
officers
and
the
honorable
discharge
or
transfer
of
supernumerary
enlisted
men
and
nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
as
authorizing
the
permanent
increase
of
the
commissioned
or
enlisted
force
of
the
regular
army
beyond
that
now
provided
by
the
law
in
force
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act
except
as
to
the
increase
of
twentyfive
majors
provided
for
in
section
hereof
the
importance
of
legislation
for
the
permanent
increase
of
the
army
is
therefore
manifest
and
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
that
purpose
has
my
unqualified
approval
there
can
be
no
question
that
at
this
time
and
probably
for
some
time
in
the
future
men
will
be
none
too
many
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
situation
at
all
events
whether
that
number
shall
be
required
permanently
or
not
the
power
should
be
given
to
the
president
to
enlist
that
force
if
in
his
discretion
it
should
be
necessary
and
the
further
discretion
should
be
given
him
to
recruit
for
the
army
within
the
above
limit
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
islands
with
the
government
of
which
we
are
charged
it
is
my
purpose
to
muster
out
the
entire
volunteer
army
as
soon
as
the
congress
shall
provide
for
the
increase
of
the
regular
establishment
this
will
be
only
an
act
of
justice
and
will
be
much
appreciated
by
the
brave
men
who
left
their
homes
and
employments
to
help
the
country
in
its
emergency
in
my
last
annual
message
i
stated
the
union
pacific
railway
main
line
was
sold
under
the
decree
of
the
united
states
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
on
the
st
and
d
of
november
of
this
year
the
amount
due
the
government
consisted
of
the
principal
of
the
subsidy
bonds
and
the
accrued
interest
thereon
making
the
total
indebtedness
the
bid
at
the
sale
covered
the
firstmortgage
lien
and
the
entire
mortgage
claim
of
the
government
principal
and
interest
this
left
the
kansas
pacific
case
unconcluded
by
a
decree
of
the
court
in
that
case
an
upset
price
for
the
property
was
fixed
at
a
sum
which
would
yield
to
the
government
only
upon
its
lien
the
sale
at
the
instance
of
the
government
was
postponed
first
to
december
and
later
upon
the
application
of
the
united
states
was
postponed
to
the
th
day
of
february
having
satisfied
myself
that
the
interests
of
the
government
required
that
an
effort
should
be
made
to
obtain
a
larger
sum
i
directed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
under
the
act
passed
march
to
pay
out
of
the
treasury
to
the
persons
entitled
to
receive
the
same
the
amounts
due
upon
all
prior
mortgages
upon
the
eastern
and
middle
divisions
of
said
railroad
out
of
any
money
in
the
treasury
not
otherwise
appropriated
whereupon
the
attorneygeneral
prepared
a
petition
to
be
presented
to
the
court
offering
to
redeem
said
prior
liens
in
such
manner
as
the
court
might
direct
and
praying
that
thereupon
the
united
states
might
be
held
to
be
subrogated
to
all
the
rights
of
said
prior
lien
holders
and
that
a
receiver
might
be
appointed
to
take
possession
of
the
mortgaged
premises
and
maintain
and
operate
the
same
until
the
court
or
congress
otherwise
directed
thereupon
the
reorganization
committee
agreed
that
if
said
petition
was
withdrawn
and
the
sale
allowed
to
proceed
on
the
th
of
february
they
would
bid
a
sum
at
the
sale
which
would
realize
to
the
government
the
entire
principal
of
its
debt
believing
that
no
better
price
could
be
obtained
and
appreciating
the
difficulties
under
which
the
government
would
labor
if
it
should
become
the
purchaser
of
the
road
at
the
sale
in
the
absence
of
any
authority
by
congress
to
take
charge
of
and
operate
the
road
i
directed
that
upon
the
guaranty
of
a
minimum
bid
which
should
give
the
government
the
principal
of
its
debt
the
sale
should
proceed
by
this
transaction
the
government
secured
an
advance
of
over
and
above
the
sum
which
the
court
had
fixed
as
the
upset
price
and
which
the
reorganization
committee
had
declared
was
the
maximum
which
they
would
pay
for
the
property
it
is
a
gratifying
fact
that
the
result
of
these
proceedings
against
the
union
pacific
system
and
the
kansas
pacific
line
is
that
the
government
has
received
on
account
of
its
subsidy
claim
the
sum
of
an
increase
of
over
the
sum
which
the
reorganization
committee
originally
agreed
to
bid
for
the
joint
property
the
government
receiving
its
whole
claim
principal
and
interest
on
the
union
pacific
and
the
principal
of
its
debt
on
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
steps
had
been
taken
to
foreclose
the
governments
lien
upon
the
central
pacific
railroad
company
but
before
action
was
commenced
congress
passed
an
act
approved
july
creating
a
commission
consisting
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
attorneygeneral
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
their
successors
in
office
with
full
power
to
settle
the
indebtedness
to
the
government
growing
out
of
the
issue
of
bonds
in
aid
of
the
construction
of
the
central
pacific
and
western
pacific
bondaided
railroads
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
president
no
report
has
yet
been
made
to
me
by
the
commission
thus
created
whatever
action
is
had
looking
to
a
settlement
of
the
indebtedness
in
accordance
with
the
act
referred
to
will
be
duly
submitted
to
the
congress
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
call
to
the
attention
of
congress
the
condition
of
the
present
building
occupied
by
the
department
of
justice
the
business
of
that
department
has
increased
very
greatly
since
it
was
established
in
its
present
quarters
the
building
now
occupied
by
it
is
neither
large
enough
nor
of
suitable
arrangement
for
the
proper
accommodation
of
the
business
of
the
department
the
supervising
architect
has
pronounced
it
unsafe
and
unsuited
for
the
use
to
which
it
is
put
the
attorneygeneral
in
his
report
states
that
the
library
of
the
department
is
upon
the
fourth
floor
and
that
all
the
space
allotted
to
it
is
so
crowded
with
books
as
to
dangerously
overload
the
structure
the
first
floor
is
occupied
by
the
court
of
claims
the
building
is
of
an
old
and
dilapidated
appearance
unsuited
to
the
dignity
which
should
attach
to
this
important
department
a
proper
regard
for
the
safety
comfort
and
convenience
of
the
officers
and
employees
would
justify
the
expenditure
of
a
liberal
sum
of
money
in
the
erection
of
a
new
building
of
commodious
proportions
and
handsome
appearance
upon
the
very
advantageous
site
already
secured
for
that
purpose
including
the
ground
occupied
by
the
present
structure
and
adjoining
vacant
lot
comprising
in
all
a
frontage
of
feet
on
pennsylvania
avenue
and
a
depth
of
feet
in
this
connection
i
may
likewise
refer
to
the
inadequate
accommodations
provided
for
the
supreme
court
in
the
capitol
and
suggest
the
wisdom
of
making
provision
for
the
erection
of
a
separate
building
for
the
court
and
its
officers
and
library
upon
available
ground
near
the
capitol
the
postal
service
of
the
country
advances
with
extraordinary
growth
within
twenty
years
both
the
revenues
and
the
expenditures
of
the
postoffice
department
have
multiplied
threefold
in
the
last
ten
years
they
have
nearly
doubled
our
postal
business
grows
much
more
rapidly
than
our
population
it
now
involves
an
expenditure
of
a
year
numbers
postoffices
and
enrolls
employees
this
remarkable
extension
of
a
service
which
is
an
accurate
index
of
the
public
conditions
presents
gratifying
evidence
of
the
advancement
of
education
of
the
increase
of
communication
and
business
activity
and
of
the
improvement
of
mail
facilities
leading
to
their
constantly
augmenting
use
the
war
with
spain
laid
new
and
exceptional
labors
on
the
postoffice
department
the
mustering
of
the
military
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
required
special
mail
arrangements
for
every
camp
and
every
campaign
the
communication
between
home
and
camp
was
naturally
eager
and
expectant
in
some
of
the
larger
places
of
rendezvous
as
many
as
letters
a
day
required
handling
this
necessity
was
met
by
the
prompt
detail
and
dispatch
of
experienced
men
from
the
established
force
and
by
directing
all
the
instrumentalities
of
the
railway
mail
and
postoffice
service
so
far
as
necessary
to
this
new
need
congress
passed
an
act
empowering
the
postmastergeneral
to
establish
offices
or
branches
at
every
military
camp
or
station
and
under
this
authority
the
postal
machinery
was
speedily
put
into
effective
operation
under
the
same
authority
when
our
forces
moved
upon
cuba
puerto
rico
and
the
philippines
they
were
attended
and
followed
by
the
postal
service
though
the
act
of
congress
authorized
the
appointment
of
postmasters
where
necessary
it
was
early
determined
that
the
public
interests
would
best
be
subserved
not
by
new
designations
but
by
the
detail
of
experienced
men
familiar
with
every
branch
of
the
service
and
this
policy
was
steadily
followed
when
the
territory
which
was
the
theater
of
conflict
came
into
our
possession
it
became
n
ecessary
to
reestablish
mail
facilities
for
the
resident
population
as
well
as
to
provide
them
for
our
forces
of
occupation
and
the
former
requirement
was
met
through
the
extension
and
application
of
the
latter
obligation
i
gave
the
requisite
authority
and
the
same
general
principle
was
applied
to
this
as
to
other
branches
of
civil
administration
under
military
occupation
the
details
are
more
particularly
given
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
and
while
the
work
is
only
just
begun
it
is
pleasing
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
service
in
the
territory
which
has
come
under
our
control
is
already
materially
improved
the
following
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
relative
to
the
increase
of
the
navy
have
my
earnest
approval

i
join
with
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
recommending
that
grades
of
admiral
and
viceadmiral
be
temporarily
revived
to
be
filled
by
officers
who
have
specially
distinguished
themselves
in
the
war
with
spain
i
earnestly
urge
upon
congress
the
importance
of
early
legislation
providing
for
the
taking
of
the
twelfth
census
this
is
necessary
in
view
of
the
large
amount
of
work
which
must
be
performed
in
the
preparation
of
the
schedules
preparatory
to
the
enumeration
of
the
population
there
were
on
the

increase
of
nearly
over
the

on
the

day
of
the
preceding

the
amount
appropriated
by
the
act
of

and
fortysix

appropriated
by
the
act
of

and
repayments
in
the
sum
of
making
a
total
of
available
for
the
payment
of
pensions
during
the
fiscal
year
the
amount
disbursed
from
that
sum
was
leaving
a
balance
of
unexpended
on
the
th
of
june
which
was
covered
into
the
treasury
there
were
names
added
to
the
rolls
during
the
year
by
special
acts
passed
at
the
second
session
of
the
fiftyfifth
congress
making
a
total
of
pensioners
by
congressional
enactments
since
the
total

of
the
patent
office
during
the
past
year

leaving
a
surplus

year
reached
acres
an
increase
of
acres
over
the
previous
year
the
total
receipts
from
public

during
the

amounted
to
an
increase

preceding
year
the
lands

in
the
eleven
forest
reservations
which
were
suspended
by
the
act
of

again
became
subject
to
the
operations
of
the
proclamations
of
february
creating
them
which
added
an
estimated
amount
of
acres
to
the
area
embraced
in
the
reserves
previously
created
in
addition
thereto
two
new
reserves
were
created
during

reserve
in

embracing
acres
and
the
prescott
reserve
in

thirty
forest
reservations

the
department
of

has
inaugurated
a
forest
system
made
possible
by
the
act
of
july
for
a
graded
force
of
officers
in
control
of
the
reserves
this
system
has
only
been
in
full
operation
since
august
but
good
results
have
already
been
secured
in
many
sections
the
reports
received
indicate
that
the
system
of
patrol
has
not
only
prevented
destructive
fires
from
gaining
headway
but
has
diminished
the
number
of
fires
the
special
attention
of
the
congress
is
called
to
that
part
of
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
relation
to
the
five
civilized
tribes
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
general
condition
of
the
indians
shows
marked
progress
but
one
outbreak
of
a
serious
character
occurred
during
the
year
and
that
among
the
chippewa
indians
of
minnesota
which
happily
has
been
suppressed
while
it
has
not
yet
been
practicable
to
enforce
all
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
june
for
the
protection
of
the
people
of
the
indian
territory
and
for
other
purposes
it
is
having
a
salutary
effect
upon
the
nations
composing
the
five
tribes
the
dawes
commission
reports
that
the
most
gratifying
results
and
greater
advance
toward
the
attainment
of
the
objects
of
the
government
have
been
secured
in
the
past
year
than
in
any
previous
year
i
can
not
too
strongly
indorse
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
and
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
the
necessity
of
providing
for
the
education
of
the
white
children
resident
in
the
indian
territory
the
department
of
agriculture
has
been
active
in
the
past
year
explorers
have
been
sent
to
many
of
the
countries
of
the
eastern
and
western
hemispheres
for
seeds
and
plants
that
may
be
useful
to
the
united
states
and
with
the
further
view
of
opening
up
markets
for
our
surplus
products
the
forestry
division
of
the
department
is
giving
special
attention
to
the
treeless
regions
of
our
country
and
is
introducing
species
specially
adapted
to
semiarid
regions
forest
fires
which
seriously
interfere
with
production
especially
in
irrigated
regions
are
being
studied
that
losses
from
this
cause
may
be
avoided
the
department
is
inquiring
into
the
use
and
abuse
of
water
in
many
states
of
the
west
and
collating
information
regarding
the
laws
of
the
states
the
decisions
of
the
courts
and
the
customs
of
the
people
in
this
regard
so
that
uniformity
may
be
secured

becoming
more
effective

the
annual

of
by

nationwide
experiments
have
been
conducted
to
ascertain
the
suitableness
as
to

and
climate
and
states
for
growing
sugar
beets
the
number
of
sugar
factories
has
been
doubled
in
the
past
two
years
and
the
ability
of
the
united
states
to
produce
its
own
sugar
from
this
source
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
the

of
november
the
national
congress
met
here
for
the
first
time
and
assumed
exclusive
control
of
the
federal
district
and
city
this
interesting
event
assumes
all
the
more
significance
when
we
recall
the
circumstances
attending
the
choosing
of
the
site
the
naming
of
the
capital
in
honor
of
the
father
of
his
country
and
the
interest
taken
by
him
in
the
adoption
of
plans
for
its
future
development
on
a
magnificent
scale
these
original
plans
have
been
wrought
out
with
a
constant
progress
and
a
signal
success
even
beyond
anything
their
framers
could
have
foreseen
the
people
of
the
country
are
justly
proud
of
the
distinctive
beauty
and
government
of
the
capital
and
of
the
rare
instruments
of
science
and
education
which
here
find
their
natural
home
a
movement
lately
inaugurated
by
the
citizens
to
have
the
anniversary
celebrated
with
fitting
ceremonies
including
perhaps
the
establishment
of
a
handsome
permanent
memorial
to
mark
so
historical
an
occasion
and
to
give
it
more
than
local
recognition
has
met
with
general
favor
on
the
part
of
the
public
i
recommend
to
the
congress
the
granting
of
an
appropriation
for
this
purpose
and
the
appointment
of
a
committee
from
its
respective
bodies
it
might
also
be
advisable
to
authorize
the
president
to
appoint
a
committee
from
the
country
at
large
which
acting
with
the
congressional
and
district
of
columbia
committees
can
complete
the
plans
for
an
appropriate
national
celebration
the
alien
contract
law
is
shown
by
experience
to
need
some
amendment
a
measure
providing
better
protection
for
seamen
is
proposed
the
rightful
application
of
the
eighthour
law
for
the
benefit
of
labor
and
of
the
principle
of
arbitration
are
suggested
for
consideration
and
i
commend
these
subjects
to
the
careful
attention
of
the
congress
the
several
departmental
reports
will
be
laid
before
you
they
give
in
great
detail
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
government
during
the
past
year
and
discuss
many
questions
upon
which
the
congress
may
feel
called
upon
to
act

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
extend
greeting
to
the
fiftyfifth
congress
assembled
in
regular
session
at
the
seat
of
government
with
many
of
whose
senators
and
representatives
i
have
been
associated
in
the
legislative
service
their
meeting
occurs
under
felicitous
conditions
justifying
sincere
congratulation
and
calling
for
our
grateful
acknowledgment
to
a
beneficent
providence
which
has
so
signally
blessed
and
prospered
us
as
a
nation
peace
and
good
will
with
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
continue
unbroken
a
matter
of
genuine
satisfaction
is
the
growing
feeling
of
fraternal
regard
and
unification
of
all
sections
of
our
country
the
incompleteness
of
which
has
too
long
delayed
realization
of
the
highest
blessings
of
the
union
the
spirit
of
patriotism
is
universal
and
is
ever
increasing
in
fervor
the
public
questions
which
now
most
engross
us
are
lifted
far
above
either
partisanship
prejudice
or
former
sectional
differences
they
affect
every
part
of
our
common
country
alike
and
permit
of
no
division
on
ancient
lines
questions
of
foreign
policy
of
revenue
the
soundness
of
the
currency
the
inviolability
of
national
obligations
the
improvement
of
the
public
service
appeal
to
the
individual
conscience
of
every
earnest
citizen
to
whatever
party
he
belongs
or
in
whatever
section
of
the
country
he
may
reside
the
extra
session
of
this
congress
which
closed
during
july
last
enacted
important
legislation
and
while
its
full
effect
has
not
yet
been
realized
what
it
has
already
accomplished
assures
us
of
its
timeliness
and
wisdom
to
test
its
permanent
value
further
time
will
be
required
and
the
people
satisfied
with
its
operation
and
results
thus
far
are
in
no
mind
to
withhold
from
it
a
fair
trial
tariff
legislation
having
been
settled
by
the
extra
session
of
congress
the
question
next
pressing
for
consideration
is
that
of
the
currency
the
work
of
putting
our
finances
upon
a
sound
basis
difficult
as
it
may
seem
will
appear
easier
when
we
recall
the
financial
operations
of
the
government
since
on
the
th
day
of
june
of
that
year
we
had
outstanding
demand
liabilities
in
the
sum
of
on
the
st
of
january
these
liabilities
had
been
reduced
to
of
our
interestbearing
obligations
the
figures
are
even
more
striking
on
july
the
principal
of
the
interestbearing
debt
of
the
government
was
on
the
st
day
of
july
this
sum
had
been
reduced
to
or
an
aggregate
reduction
of
the
interestbearing
debt
of
the
united
states
on
the
st
day
of
december
was
the
government
money
now
outstanding
december
consists
of
of
united
states
notes
of
treasury
notes
issued
by
authority
of
the
law
of
of
silver
certificates
and
of
standard
silver
dollars
with
the
great
resources
of
the
government
and
with
the
honorable
example
of
the
past
before
us
we
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
enter
upon
a
currency
revision
which
will
make
our
demand
obligations
less
onerous
to
the
government
and
relieve
our
financial
laws
from
ambiguity
and
doubt
the
brief
review
of
what
was
accomplished
from
the
close
of
the
war
to
makes
unreasonable
and
groundless
any
distrust
either
of
our
financial
ability
or
soundness
while
the
situation
from
to
must
admonish
congress
of
the
immediate
necessity
of
so
legislating
as
to
make
the
return
of
the
conditions
then
prevailing
impossible
there
are
many
plans
proposed
as
a
remedy
for
the
evil
before
we
can
find
the
true
remedy
we
must
appreciate
the
real
evil
it
is
not
that
our
currency
of
every
kind
is
not
good
for
every
dollar
of
it
is
good
good
because
the
governments
pledge
is
out
to
keep
it
so
and
that
pledge
will
not
be
broken
however
the
guaranty
of
our
purpose
to
keep
the
pledge
will
be
best
shown
by
advancing
toward
its
fulfillment
the
evil
of
the
present
system
is
found
in
the
great
cost
to
the
government
of
maintaining
the
parity
of
our
different
forms
of
money
that
is
keeping
all
of
them
at
par
with
gold
we
surely
cannot
be
longer
heedless
of
the
burden
this
imposes
upon
the
people
even
under
fairly
prosperous
conditions
while
the
past
four
years
have
demonstrated
that
it
is
not
only
an
expensive
charge
upon
the
government
but
a
dangerous
menace
to
the
national
credit
it
is
manifest
that
we
must
devise
some
plan
to
protect
the
government
against
bond
issues
for
repeated
redemptions
we
must
either
curtail
the
opportunity
for
speculation
made
easy
by
the
multiplied
redemptions
of
our
demand
obligations
or
increase
the
gold
reserve
for
their
redemption
we
have
of
currency
which
the
government
by
solemn
enactment
has
undertaken
to
keep
at
par
with
gold
nobody
is
obliged
to
redeem
in
gold
but
the
government
the
banks
are
not
required
to
redeem
in
gold
the
government
is
obliged
to
keep
equal
with
gold
all
its
outstanding
currency
and
coin
obligations
while
its
receipts
are
not
required
to
be
paid
in
gold
they
are
paid
in
every
kind
of
money
but
gold
and
the
only
means
by
which
the
government
can
with
certainty
get
gold
is
by
borrowing
it
can
get
it
in
no
other
way
when
it
most
needs
it
the
government
without
any
fixed
gold
revenue
is
pledged
to
maintain
gold
redemption
which
it
has
steadily
and
faithfully
done
and
which
under
the
authority
now
given
it
will
continue
to
do
the
law
which
requires
the
government
after
having
redeemed
its
united
states
notes
to
pay
them
out
again
as
current
funds
demands
a
constant
replenishment
of
the
gold
reserve
this
is
especially
so
in
times
of
business
panic
and
when
the
revenues
are
insufficient
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
government
at
such
times
the
government
has
no
other
way
to
supply
its
deficit
and
maintain
redemption
but
through
the
increase
of
its
bonded
debt
as
during
the
administration
of
my
predecessor
when
of
fourandahalf
per
cent
bonds
were
issued
and
sold
and
the
proceeds
used
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
government
in
excess
of
the
revenues
and
sustain
the
gold
reserve
while
it
is
true
that
the
greater
part
of
the
proceeds
of
these
bonds
were
used
to
supply
deficient
revenues
a
considerable
portion
was
required
to
maintain
the
gold
reserve
with
our
revenues
equal
to
our
expenses
there
would
be
no
deficit
requiring
the
issuance
of
bonds
but
if
the
gold
reserve
falls
below
how
will
it
be
replenished
except
by
selling
more
bonds
is
there
any
other
way
practicable
under
existing
law
the
serious
question
then
is
shall
we
continue
the
policy
that
has
been
pursued
in
the
past
that
is
when
the
gold
reserve
reaches
the
point
of
danger
issue
more
bonds
and
supply
the
needed
gold
or
shall
we
provide
other
means
to
prevent
these
recurring
drains
upon
the
gold
reserve
if
no
further
legislation
is
had
and
the
policy
of
selling
bonds
is
to
be
continued
then
congress
should
give
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
authority
to
sell
bonds
at
long
or
short
periods
bearing
a
less
rate
of
interest
than
is
now
authorized
by
law
i
earnestly
recommend
as
soon
as
the
receipts
of
the
government
are
quite
sufficient
to
pay
all
the
expenses
of
the
government
that
when
any
of
the
united
states
notes
are
presented
for
redemption
in
gold
and
are
redeemed
in
gold
such
notes
shall
be
kept
and
set
apart
and
only
paid
out
in
exchange
for
gold
this
is
an
obvious
duty
if
the
holder
of
the
united
states
note
prefers
the
gold
and
gets
it
from
the
government
he
should
not
receive
back
from
the
government
a
united
states
note
without
paying
gold
in
exchange
for
it
the
reason
for
this
is
made
all
the
more
apparent
when
the
government
issues
an
interestbearing
debt
to
provide
gold
for
the
redemption
of
united
states
notesa
noninterestbearing
debt
surely
it
should
not
pay
them
out
again
except
on
demand
and
for
gold
if
they
are
put
out
in
any
other
way
they
may
return
again
to
be
followed
by
another
bond
issue
to
redeem
themanother
interestbearing
debt
to
redeem
a
noninterestbearing
debt
in
my
view
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
government
should
be
relieved
from
the
burden
of
providing
all
the
gold
required
for
exchanges
and
export
this
responsibility
is
alone
borne
by
the
government
without
any
of
the
usual
and
necessary
banking
powers
to
help
itself
the
banks
do
not
feel
the
strain
of
gold
redemption
the
whole
strain
rests
upon
the
government
and
the
size
of
the
gold
reserve
in
the
treasury
has
come
to
be
with
or
without
reason
the
signal
of
danger
or
of
security
this
ought
to
be
stopped
if
we
are
to
have
an
era
of
prosperity
in
the
country
with
sufficient
receipts
for
the
expenses
of
the
government
we
may
feel
no
immediate
embarrassment
from
our
present
currency
but
the
danger
still
exists
and
will
be
ever
present
menacing
us
so
long
as
the
existing
system
continues
and
besides
it
is
in
times
of
adequate
revenues
and
business
tranquillity
that
the
government
should
prepare
for
the
worst
we
cannot
avoid
without
serious
consequences
the
wise
consideration
and
prompt
solution
of
this
question
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
outlined
a
plan
in
great
detail
for
the
purpose
of
removing
the
threatened
recurrence
of
a
depleted
gold
reserve
and
save
us
from
future
embarrassment
on
that
account
to
this
plan
i
invite
your
careful
consideration
i
concur
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
recommendation
that
national
banks
be
allowed
to
issue
notes
to
the
face
value
of
the
bonds
which
they
have
deposited
for
circulation
and
that
the
tax
on
circulating
notes
secured
by
deposit
of
such
bonds
be
reduced
to
onehalf
of
one
per
cent
per
annum
i
also
join
him
in
recommending
that
authority
be
given
for
the
establishment
of
national
banks
with
a
minimum
capital
of
this
will
enable
the
smaller
villages
and
agricultural
regions
of
the
country
to
be
supplied
with
currency
to
meet
their
needs
i
recommend
that
the
issue
of
national
bank
notes
be
restricted
to
the
denomination
of
ten
dollars
and
upwards
if
the
suggestions
i
have
herein
made
shall
have
the
approval
of
congress
then
i
would
recommend
that
national
banks
be
required
to
redeem
their
notes
in
gold
the
most
important
problem
with
which
this
government
is
now
called
upon
to
deal
pertaining
to
its
foreign
relations
concerns
its
duty
toward
spain
and
the
cuban
i
nsurrection
problems
and
conditions
more
or
less
in
common
with
those
now
existing
have
confronted
this
government
at
various
times
in
the
past
the
story
of
cuba
for
many
years
has
been
one
of
unrest
growing
discontent
an
effort
toward
a
larger
enjoyment
of
liberty
and
selfcontrol
of
organized
resistance
to
the
mother
country
of
depression
after
distress
and
warfare
and
of
ineffectual
settlement
to
be
followed
by
renewed
revolt
for
no
enduring
period
since
the
enfranchisement
of
the
continental
possessions
of
spain
in
the
western
continent
has
the
condition
of
cuba
or
the
policy
of
spain
toward
cuba
not
caused
concern
to
the
united
states
the
prospect
from
time
to
time
that
the
weakness
of
spains
hold
upon
the
island
and
the
political
vicissitudes
and
embarrassments
of
the
home
government
might
lead
to
the
transfer
of
cuba
to
a
continental
power
called
forth
between
and
various
emphatic
declarations
of
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
permit
no
disturbance
of
cubas
connection
with
spain
unless
in
the
direction
of
independence
or
acquisition
by
us
through
purchase
nor
has
there
been
any
change
of
this
declared
policy
since
upon
the
part
of
the
government
the
revolution
which
began
in
lasted
for
ten
years
despite
the
strenuous
efforts
of
the
successive
peninsular
governments
to
suppress
it
then
as
now
the
government
of
the
united
states
testified
its
grave
concern
and
offered
its
aid
to
put
an
end
to
bloodshed
in
cuba
the
overtures
made
by
general
grant
were
refused
and
the
war
dragged
on
entailing
great
loss
of
life
and
treasure
and
increased
injury
to
american
interests
besides
throwing
enhanced
burdens
of
neutrality
upon
this
government
in
peace
was
brought
about
by
the
truce
of
zanjon
obtained
by
negotiations
between
the
spanish
commander
martinez
de
campos
and
the
insurgent
leaders
the
present
insurrection
broke
out
in
february
it
is
not
my
purpose
at
this
time
to
recall
its
remarkable
increase
or
to
characterize
its
tenacious
resistance
against
the
enormous
forces
massed
against
it
by
spain
the
revolt
and
the
efforts
to
subdue
it
carried
destruction
to
every
quarter
of
the
island
developing
wide
proportions
and
defying
the
efforts
of
spain
for
its
suppression
the
civilized
code
of
war
has
been
disregarded
no
less
so
by
the
spaniards
than
by
the
cubans
the
existing
conditions
can
not
but
fill
this
government
and
the
american
people
with
the
gravest
apprehension
there
is
no
desire
on
the
part
of
our
people
to
profit
by
the
misfortunes
of
spain
we
have
only
the
desire
to
see
the
cubans
prosperous
and
contented
enjoying
that
measure
of
selfcontrol
which
is
the
inalienable
right
of
man
protected
in
their
right
to
reap
the
benefit
of
the
exhaustless
treasures
of
their
country
the
offer
made
by
my
predecessor
in
april
tendering
the
friendly
offices
of
this
government
failed
any
mediation
on
our
part
was
not
accepted
in
brief
the
answer
read
there
is
no
effectual
way
to
pacify
cuba
unless
it
begins
with
the
actual
submission
of
the
rebels
to
the
mother
country
then
only
could
spain
act
in
the
promised
direction
of
her
own
motion
and
after
her
own
plans
the
cruel
policy
of
concentration
was
initiated
february
the
productive
districts
controlled
by
the
spanish
armies
were
depopulated
the
agricultural
inhabitants
were
herded
in
and
about
the
garrison
towns
their
lands
laid
waste
and
their
dwellings
destroyed
this
policy
the
late
cabinet
of
spain
justified
as
a
necessary
measure
of
war
and
as
a
means
of
cutting
off
supplies
from
the
insurgents
it
has
utterly
failed
as
a
war
measure
it
was
not
civilized
warfare
it
was
extermination
against
this
abuse
of
the
rights
of
war
i
have
felt
constrained
on
repeated
occasions
to
enter
the
firm
and
earnest
protest
of
this
government
there
was
much
of
public
condemnation
of
the
treatment
of
american
citizens
by
alleged
illegal
arrests
and
long
imprisonment
awaiting
trial
or
pending
protracted
judicial
proceedings
i
felt
it
my
first
duty
to
make
instant
demand
for
the
release
or
speedy
trial
of
all
american
citizens
under
arrest
before
the
change
of
the
spanish
cabinet
in
october
last
twentytwo
prisoners
citizens
of
the
united
states
had
been
given
their
freedom
for
the
relief
of
our
own
citizens
suffering
because
of
the
conflict
the
aid
of
congress
was
sought
in
a
special
message
and
under
the
appropriation
of
may
effective
aid
has
been
given
to
american
citizens
in
cuba
many
of
them
at
their
own
request
having
been
returned
to
the
united
states
the
instructions
given
to
our
new
minister
to
spain
before
his
departure
for
his
post
directed
him
to
impress
upon
that
government
the
sincere
wish
of
the
united
states
to
lend
its
aid
toward
the
ending
of
the
war
in
cuba
by
reaching
a
peaceful
and
lasting
result
just
and
honorable
alike
to
spain
and
to
the
cuban
people
these
instructions
recited
the
character
and
duration
of
the
contest
the
widespread
losses
it
entails
the
burdens
and
restraints
it
imposes
upon
us
with
constant
disturbance
of
national
interests
and
the
injury
resulting
from
an
indefinite
continuance
of
this
state
of
things
it
was
stated
that
at
this
juncture
our
government
was
constrained
to
seriously
inquire
if
the
time
was
not
ripe
when
spain
of
her
own
volition
moved
by
her
own
interests
and
every
sentiment
of
humanity
should
put
a
stop
to
this
destructive
war
and
make
proposals
of
settlement
honorable
to
herself
and
just
to
her
cuban
colony
it
was
urged
that
as
a
neighboring
nation
with
large
interests
in
cuba
we
could
be
required
to
wait
only
a
reasonable
time
for
the
mother
country
to
establish
its
authority
and
restore
peace
and
order
within
the
borders
of
the
island
that
we
could
not
contemplate
an
indefinite
period
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
result
no
solution
was
proposed
to
which
the
slightest
idea
of
humiliation
to
spain
could
attach
and
indeed
precise
proposals
were
withheld
to
avoid
embarrassment
to
that
government
all
that
was
asked
or
expected
was
that
some
safe
way
might
be
speedily
provided
and
permanent
peace
restored
it
so
chanced
that
the
consideration
of
this
offer
addressed
to
the
same
spanish
administration
which
had
declined
the
tenders
of
my
predecessor
and
which
for
more
than
two
years
had
poured
men
and
treasure
into
cuba
in
the
fruitless
effort
to
suppress
the
revolt
fell
to
others
between
the
departure
of
general
woodford
the
new
envoy
and
his
arrival
in
spain
the
statesman
who
had
shaped
the
policy
of
his
country
fell
by
the
hand
of
an
assassin
and
although
the
cabinet
of
the
late
premier
still
held
office
and
received
from
our
envoy
the
proposals
he
bore
that
cabinet
gave
place
within
a
few
days
thereafter
to
a
new
administration
under
the
leadership
of
sagasta
the
reply
to
our
note
was
received
on
the
d
day
of
october
it
is
in
the
direction
of
a
better
understanding
it
appreciates
the
friendly
purposes
of
this
government
it
admits
that
our
country
is
deeply
affected
by
the
war
in
cuba
and
that
its
desires
for
peace
are
just
it
declares
that
the
present
spanish
government
is
bound
by
every
consideration
to
a
change
of
policy
that
should
satisfy
the
united
states
and
pacify
cuba
within
a
reasonable
time
to
this
end
spain
has
decided
to
put
into
effect
the
political
reforms
heretofore
advocated
by
the
present
premier
without
halting
for
any
consideration
in
the
path
which
in
its
judgment
leads
to
peace
the
military
operations
it
is
said
will
continue
but
will
be
humane
and
conducted
with
all
regard
for
private
rights
being
accompanied
by
political
action
leading
to
the
autonomy
of
cuba
while
guarding
spanish
sovereignty
this
it
is
claimed
will
result
in
investing
cuba
with
a
distinct
personality
the
island
to
be
governed
by
an
executive
and
by
a
local
council
or
chamber
reserving
to
spain
the
control
of
the
foreign
relations
the
army
and
navy
and
the
judicial
administration
to
accomplish
this
the
present
government
proposes
to
modify
existing
legislation
by
decree
leaving
the
spanish
cortes
with
the
aid
of
cuban
senators
and
deputies
to
solve
the
economic
problem
and
properly
distribute
the
existing
debt
in
the
absence
of
a
declaration
of
the
measures
that
this
government
proposes
to
take
in
carrying
out
its
proffer
of
good
offices
it
suggests
that
spain
be
left
free
to
conduct
military
operations
and
grant
political
reforms
while
the
united
states
for
its
part
shall
enforce
its
neutral
obligations
and
cut
off
the
assistance
which
it
is
asserted
the
insurgents
receive
from
this
country
the
supposition
of
an
indefinite
prolongation
of
the
war
is
denied
it
is
asserted
that
the
western
provinces
are
already
wellnigh
reclaimed
that
the
planting
of
cane
and
tobacco
therein
has
been
resumed
and
that
by
force
of
arms
and
new
and
ample
reforms
very
early
and
complete
pacification
is
hoped
for
the
immediate
amelioration
of
existing
conditions
under
the
new
administration
of
cuban
affairs
is
predicted
and
therewithal
the
disturbance
and
all
occasion
for
any
change
of
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
discussion
of
the
question
of
the
international
duties
and
responsibilities
of
the
united
states
as
spain
understands
them
is
presented
with
an
apparent
disposition
to
charge
us
with
failure
in
this
regard
this
charge
is
without
any
basis
in
fact
it
could
not
have
been
made
if
spain
had
been
cognizant
of
the
constant
efforts
this
government
has
made
at
the
cost
of
millions
and
by
the
employment
of
the
administrative
machinery
of
the
nation
at
command
to
perform
its
full
duty
according
to
the
law
of
nations
that
it
has
successfully
prevented
the
departure
of
a
single
military
expedition
or
armed
vessel
from
our
shores
in
violation
of
our
laws
would
seem
to
be
a
sufficient
answer
but
of
this
aspect
of
the
spanish
note
it
is
not
necessary
to
speak
further
now
firm
in
the
conviction
of
a
wholly
performed
obligation
due
response
to
this
charge
has
been
made
in
diplomatic
course
throughout
all
these
horrors
and
dangers
to
our
own
peace
this
government
has
never
in
any
way
abrogated
its
sovereign
prerogative
of
reserving
to
itself
the
determinatio
n
of
its
policy
and
course
according
to
its
own
high
sense
of
right
and
in
consonance
with
the
dearest
interests
and
convictions
of
our
own
people
should
the
prolongation
of
the
strife
so
demand
of
the
untried
measures
there
remain
only
recognition
of
the
insurgents
as
belligerents
recognition
of
the
independence
of
cuba
neutral
intervention
to
end
the
war
by
imposing
a
rational
compromise
between
the
contestants
and
intervention
in
favor
of
one
or
the
other
party
i
speak
not
of
forcible
annexation
for
that
can
not
be
thought
of
that
by
our
code
of
morality
would
be
criminal
aggression
recognition
of
the
belligerency
of
the
cuban
insurgents
has
often
been
canvassed
as
a
possible
if
not
inevitable
step
both
in
regard
to
the
previous
ten
years
struggle
and
during
the
present
war
i
am
not
unmindful
that
the
two
houses
of
congress
in
the
spring
of
expressed
the
opinion
by
concurrent
resolution
that
a
condition
of
public
war
existed
requiring
or
justifying
the
recognition
of
a
state
of
belligerency
in
cuba
and
during
the
extra
session
the
senate
voted
a
joint
resolution
of
like
import
which
however
was
not
brought
to
a
vote
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
presence
of
these
significant
expressions
of
the
sentiment
of
the
legislative
branch
it
behooves
the
executive
to
soberly
consider
the
conditions
under
which
so
important
a
measure
must
needs
rest
for
justification
it
is
to
be
seriously
considered
whether
the
cuban
insurrection
possesses
beyond
dispute
the
attributes
of
statehood
which
alone
can
demand
the
recognition
of
belligerency
in
its
favor
possession
in
short
of
the
essential
qualifications
of
sovereignty
by
the
insurgents
and
the
conduct
of
the
war
by
them
according
to
the
received
code
of
war
are
no
less
important
factors
toward
the
determination
of
the
problem
of
belligerency
than
are
the
influences
and
consequences
of
the
struggle
upon
the
internal
polity
of
the
recognizing
state
the
wise
utterances
of
president
grant
in
his
memorable
message
of
december
are
signally
relevant
to
the
present
situation
in
cuba
and
it
may
be
wholesome
now
to
recall
them
at
that
time
a
ruinous
conflict
had
for
seven
years
wasted
the
neighboring
island
during
all
those
years
an
utter
disregard
of
the
laws
of
civilized
warfare
and
of
the
just
demands
of
humanity
which
called
forth
expressions
of
condemnation
from
the
nations
of
christendom
continued
unabated
desolation
and
ruin
pervaded
that
productive
region
enormously
affecting
the
commerce
of
all
commercial
nations
but
that
of
the
united
states
more
than
any
other
by
reason
of
proximity
and
larger
trade
and
intercourse
at
that
juncture
general
grant
uttered
these
words
which
now
as
then
sum
up
the
elements
of
the
problem
a
recognition
of
the
independence
of
cuba
being
in
my
opinion
impracticable
and
indefensible
the
question
which
next
presents
itself
is
that
of
the
recognition
of
belligerent
rights
in
the
parties
to
the
contest
in
a
former
message
to
congress
i
had
occasion
to
consider
this
question
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
conflict
in
cuba
dreadful
and
devastating
as
were
its
incidents
did
not
rise
to
the
fearful
dignity
of
war
it
is
possible
that
the
acts
of
foreign
powers
and
even
acts
of
spain
herself
of
this
very
nature
might
be
pointed
to
in
defense
of
such
recognition
but
now
as
in
its
past
history
the
united
states
should
carefully
avoid
the
false
lights
which
might
lead
it
into
the
mazes
of
doubtful
law
and
of
questionable
propriety
and
adhere
rigidly
and
sternly
to
the
rule
which
has
been
its
guide
of
doing
only
that
which
is
right
and
honest
and
of
good
report
the
question
of
according
or
of
withholding
rights
of
belligerency
must
be
judged
in
every
case
in
view
of
the
particular
attending
facts
unless
justified
by
necessity
it
is
always
and
justly
regarded
as
an
unfriendly
act
and
a
gratuitous
demonstration
of
moral
support
to
the
rebellion
it
is
necessary
and
it
is
required
when
the
interests
and
rights
of
another
government
or
of
its
people
are
so
far
affected
by
a
pending
civil
conflict
as
to
require
a
definition
of
its
relations
to
the
parties
thereto
but
this
conflict
must
be
one
which
will
be
recognized
in
the
sense
of
international
law
as
war
belligerence
too
is
a
fact
the
mere
existence
of
contending
armed
bodies
and
their
occasional
conflicts
do
not
constitute
war
in
the
sense
referred
to
applying
to
the
existing
condition
of
affairs
in
cuba
the
tests
recognized
by
publicists
and
writers
on
international
law
and
which
have
been
observed
by
nations
of
dignity
honesty
and
power
when
free
from
sensitive
or
selfish
and
unworthy
motives
i
fail
to
find
in
the
insurrection
the
existence
of
such
a
substantial
political
organization
real
palpable
and
manifest
to
the
world
having
the
forms
and
capable
of
the
ordinary
functions
of
government
toward
its
own
people
and
to
other
states
with
courts
for
the
administration
of
justice
with
a
local
habitation
possessing
such
organization
of
force
such
material
such
occupation
of
territory
as
to
take
the
contest
out
of
the
category
of
a
mere
rebellious
insurrection
or
occasional
skirmishes
and
place
it
on
the
terrible
footing
of
war
to
which
a
recognition
of
belligerency
would
aim
to
elevate
it
the
contest
moreover
is
solely
on
land
the
insurrection
has
not
possessed
itself
of
a
single
seaport
whence
it
may
send
forth
its
flag
nor
has
it
any
means
of
communication
with
foreign
powers
except
through
the
military
lines
of
its
adversaries
no
apprehension
of
any
of
those
sudden
and
difficult
complications
which
a
war
upon
the
ocean
is
apt
to
precipitate
upon
the
vessels
both
commercial
and
national
and
upon
the
consular
officers
of
other
powers
calls
for
the
definition
of
their
relations
to
the
parties
to
the
contest
considered
as
a
question
of
expediency
i
regard
the
accordance
of
belligerent
rights
still
to
be
as
unwise
and
premature
as
i
regard
it
to
be
at
present
indefensible
as
a
measure
of
right
such
recognition
entails
upon
the
country
according
the
rights
which
flow
from
it
difficult
and
complicated
duties
and
requires
the
exaction
from
the
contending
parties
of
the
strict
observance
of
their
rights
and
obligations
it
confers
the
right
of
search
upon
the
high
seas
by
vessels
of
both
parties
it
would
subject
the
carrying
of
arms
and
munitions
of
war
which
now
may
be
transported
freely
and
without
interruption
in
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
to
detention
and
to
possible
seizure
it
would
give
rise
to
countless
vexatious
questions
would
release
the
parent
government
from
responsibility
for
acts
done
by
the
insurgents
and
would
invest
spain
with
the
right
to
exercise
the
supervision
recognized
by
our
treaty
of
over
our
commerce
on
the
high
seas
a
very
large
part
of
which
in
its
traffic
between
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
states
and
between
all
of
them
and
the
states
on
the
pacific
passes
through
the
waters
which
wash
the
shores
of
cuba
the
exercise
of
this
supervision
could
scarce
fail
to
lead
if
not
to
abuses
certainly
to
collisions
perilous
to
the
peaceful
relations
of
the
two
states
there
can
be
little
doubt
to
what
result
such
supervision
would
before
long
draw
this
nation
it
would
be
unworthy
of
the
united
states
to
inaugurate
the
possibilities
of
such
result
by
measures
of
questionable
right
or
expediency
or
by
any
indirection
turning
to
the
practical
aspects
of
a
recognition
of
belligerency
and
reviewing
its
inconveniences
and
positive
dangers
still
further
pertinent
considerations
appear
in
the
code
of
nations
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
naked
recognition
of
belligerency
unaccompanied
by
the
assumption
of
international
neutrality
such
recognition
without
more
will
not
confer
upon
either
party
to
a
domestic
conflict
a
status
not
theretofore
actually
possessed
or
affect
the
relation
of
either
party
to
other
states
the
act
of
recognition
usually
takes
the
form
of
a
solemn
proclamation
of
neutrality
which
recites
the
de
facto
condition
of
belligerency
as
its
motive
it
announces
a
domestic
law
of
neutrality
in
the
declaring
state
it
assumes
the
international
obligations
of
a
neutral
in
the
presence
of
a
public
state
of
war
it
warns
all
citizens
and
others
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
proclaimant
that
they
violate
those
rigorous
obligations
at
their
own
peril
and
can
not
expect
to
be
shielded
from
the
consequences
the
right
of
visit
and
search
on
the
seas
and
seizure
of
vessels
and
cargoes
and
contraband
of
war
and
good
prize
under
admiralty
law
must
under
international
law
be
admitted
as
a
legitimate
consequence
of
a
proclamation
of
belligerency
while
according
the
equal
belligerent
rights
defined
by
public
law
to
each
party
in
our
ports
disfavors
would
be
imposed
on
both
which
while
nominally
equal
would
weigh
heavily
in
behalf
of
spain
herself
possessing
a
navy
and
controlling
the
ports
of
cuba
her
maritime
rights
could
be
asserted
not
only
for
the
military
investment
of
the
island
but
up
to
the
margin
of
our
own
territorial
waters
and
a
condition
of
things
would
exist
for
which
the
cubans
within
their
own
domain
could
not
hope
to
create
a
parallel
while
its
creation
through
aid
or
sympathy
from
within
our
domain
would
be
even
more
impossible
than
now
with
the
additional
obligations
of
international
neutrality
we
would
perforce
assume
the
enforcement
of
this
enlarged
and
onerous
code
of
neutrality
would
only
be
influential
within
our
own
jurisdiction
by
land
and
sea
and
applicable
by
our
own
instrumentalities
it
could
impart
to
the
united
states
no
jurisdiction
between
spain
and
the
insurgents
it
would
give
the
united
states
no
right
of
intervention
to
enforce
the
conduct
of
the
strife
within
the
paramount
authority
of
spain
according
to
the
international
code
of
war
for
these
reasons
i
regard
the
recognition
of
the
belligerency
of
the
cuban
insurgents
as
now
unwise
and
therefore
inadmissible
should
that
step
hereafter
be
deemed
wise
as
a
measure
of
right
and
duty
the
executive
will
take
it
intervention
upon
humanitarian
grounds
has
been
frequently
suggested
and
has
not
failed
to
receive
my
mo
st
anxious
and
earnest
consideration
but
should
such
a
step
be
now
taken
when
it
is
apparent
that
a
hopeful
change
has
supervened
in
the
policy
of
spain
toward
cuba
a
new
government
has
taken
office
in
the
mother
country
it
is
pledged
in
advance
to
the
declaration
that
all
the
effort
in
the
world
can
not
suffice
to
maintain
peace
in
cuba
by
the
bayonet
that
vague
promises
of
reform
after
subjugation
afford
no
solution
of
the
insular
problem
that
with
a
substitution
of
commanders
must
come
a
change
of
the
past
system
of
warfare
for
one
in
harmony
with
a
new
policy
which
shall
no
longer
aim
to
drive
the
cubans
to
the
horrible
alternative
of
taking
to
the
thicket
or
succumbing
in
misery
that
reforms
must
be
instituted
in
accordance
with
the
needs
and
circumstances
of
the
time
and
that
these
reforms
while
designed
to
give
full
autonomy
to
the
colony
and
to
create
a
virtual
entity
and
selfcontrolled
administration
shall

that
the

course
from
which

with
honor
is
impossible
can
hardly
be
questioned
that
in
the
few
weeks
it
has
existed
it
has
made
earnest
of
the
sincerity
of
its
professions
is
undeniable
i
shall
not
impugn
its
sincerity
nor
should
impatience
be
suffered
to
embarrass
it
in
the
task
it
has
undertaken
it
is
honestly
due
to
spain
and
to
our
friendly
relations
with
spain
that
she
should
be
given
a
reasonable
chance
to
realize
her
expectations
and
to
prove
the
asserted
efficacy
of
the
new
order
of
things
to
which
she
stands
irrevocably
committed
she
has
recalled
the
commander
whose
brutal
orders
inflamed
the
american
mind
and
shocked
the
civilized
world
she
has
modified
the
horrible
order
of
concentration
and
has
undertaken
to
care
for
the
helpless
and
permit
those
who
desire
to
resume
the
cultivation
of
their
fields
to
do
so
and
assures
them
of
the
protection
of
the
spanish
government
in
their
lawful
occupations
she
has
just
released
the
competitor
prisoners
heretofore
sentenced
to
death
and
who
have
been
the
subject
of
repeated
diplomatic
correspondence
during
both
this
and
the
preceding
administration
not
a
single
american
citizen
is
now
in
arrest
or
confinement
in
cuba
of
whom
this
government
has
any
knowledge
the
near
future
will
demonstrate
whether
the
indispensable
condition
of
a
righteous
peace
just
alike
to
the
cubans
and
to
spain
as
well
as
equitable
to
all
our
interests
so
intimately
involved
in
the
welfare
of
cuba
is
likely
to
be
attained
if
not
the
exigency
of
further
and
other
action
by
the
united
states
will
remain
to
be
taken
when
that
time
comes
that
action
will
be
determined
in
the
line
of
indisputable
right
and
duty
it
will
be
faced
without
misgiving
or
hesitancy
in
the
light
of
the
obligation
this
government
owes
to
itself
to
the
people
who
have
confided
to
it
the
protection
of
their
interests
and
honor
and
to
humanity
sure
of
the
right
keeping
free
from
all
offense
ourselves
actuated
only
by
upright
and
patriotic
considerations
moved
neither
by
passion
nor
selfishness
the
government
will
continue
its
watchful
care
over
the
rights
and
property
of
american
citizens
and
will
abate
none
of
its
efforts
to
bring
about
by
peaceful
agencies
a
peace
which
shall
be
honorable
and
enduring
if
it
shall
hereafter
appear
to
be
a
duty
imposed
by
our
obligations
to
ourselves
to
civilization
and
humanity
to
intervene
with
force
it
shall
be
without
fault
on
our
part
and
only
because
the
necessity
for
such
action
will
be
so
clear
as
to
command
the
support
and
approval
of
the
civilized
world
by
a
special
message
dated
the
th
day
of
june
last
i
laid
before
the
senate
a
treaty
signed
that
day
by
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
republic
of
hawaii
having
for
its
purpose
the
incorporation
of
the
hawaiian
islands
as
an
integral
part
of
the
united
states
and
under
its
sovereignty
the
senate
having
removed
the
injunction
of
secrecy
although
the
treaty
is
still
pending
before
that
body
the
subject
may
be
properly
referred
to
in
this
message
because
the
necessary
action
of
the
congress
is
required
to
determine
by
legislation
many
details
of
the
eventual
union
should
the
fact
of
annexation
be
accomplished
as
i
believe
it
should
be
while
consistently
disavowing
from
a
very
early
period
any
aggressive
policy
of
absorption
in
regard
to
the
hawaiian
group
a
long
series
of
declarations
through
threequarters
of
a
century
has
proclaimed
the
vital
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
independent
life
of
the
islands
and
their
intimate
commercial
dependence
upon
this
country
at
the
same
time
it
has
been
repeatedly
asserted
that
in
no
event
could
the
entity
of
hawaiian
statehood
cease
by
the
passage
of
the
islands
under
the
domination
or
influence
of
another
power
than
the
united
states
under
these
circumstances
the
logic
of
events
required
that
annexation
heretofore
offered
but
declined
should
in
the
ripeness
of
time
come
about
as
the
natural
result
of
the
strengthening
ties
that
bind
us
to
those
islands
and
be
realized
by
the
free
will
of
the
hawaiian
state
that
treaty
was
unanimously
ratified
without
amendment
by
the
senate
and
president
of
the
republic
of
hawaii
on
the
th
of
september
last
and
only
awaits
the
favorable
action
of
the
american
senate
to
effect
the
complete
absorption
of
the
islands
into
the
domain
of
the
united
states
what
the
conditions
of
such
a
union
shall
be
the
political
relation
thereof
to
the
united
states
the
character
of
the
local
administration
the
quality
and
degree
of
the
elective
franchise
of
the
inhabitants
the
extension
of
the
federal
laws
to
the
territory
or
the
enactment
of
special
laws
to
fit
the
peculiar
condition
thereof
the
regulation
if
need
be
of
the
labor
system
therein
are
all
matters
which
the
treaty
has
wisely
relegated
to
the
congress
if
the
treaty
is
confirmed
as
every
consideration
of
dignity
and
honor
requires
the
wisdom
of
congress
will
see
to
it
that
avoiding
abrupt
assimilation
of
elements
perhaps
hardly
yet
fitted
to
share
in
the
highest
franchises
of
citizenship
and
having
due
regard
to
the
geographical
conditions
the
most
just
provisions
for
selfrule
in
local
matters
with
the
largest
political
liberties
as
an
integral
part
of
our
nation
will
be
accorded
to
the
hawaiians
no
less
is
due
to
a
people
who
after
nearly
five
years
of
demonstrated
capacity
to
fulfill
the
obligations
of
selfgoverning
statehood
come
of
their
free
will
to
merge
their
destinies
in
our
bodypolitic
the
questions
which
have
arisen
between
japan
and
hawaii
by
reason
of
the
treatment
of
japanese

laborers
emigrating
to
the
islands
under
the
hawaiianjapanese
convention
of
are
in
a
satisfactory
stage
of
settlement
by
negotiation
this
government
has
not
been
invited
to
mediate
and
on
the
other
hand
has
sought
no
intervention
in
that
matter
further
than
to
evince
its
kindliest
disposition
toward
such
a
speedy
and
direct
adjustment
by
the
two
sovereign
states
in
interest
as
shall
comport
with
equity
and
honor
it
is
gratifying
to
learn
that
the
apprehensions
at
first
displayed
on
the
part
of
japan
lest
the
cessation
of
hawaiis
national
life
through
annexation
might
impair
privileges
to
which
japan
honorably
laid
claim
have
given
place
to
confidence
in
the
uprightness
of
this
government
and
in
the
sincerity
of
its
purpose
to
deal
with
all
possible
ulterior
questions
in
the
broadest
spirit
of
friendliness
as
to
the
representation
of
this
government
to
nicaragua
salvador
and
costa
rica
i
have
concluded
that
mr
william
l
merry
confirmed
as
minister
of
the
united
states
to
the
states
of
nicaragua
salvador
and
costa
rica
shall
proceed
to
san
jose
costa
rica
and
there
temporarily
establish
the
headquarters
of
the
united
states
to
those
three
states
i
took
this
action
for
what
i
regarded
as
the
paramount
interests
of
this
country
it
was
developed
upon
an
investigation
by
the
secretary
of
state
that
the
government
of
nicaragua
while
not
unwilling
to
receive
mr
merry
in
his
diplomatic
quality
was
unable
to
do
so
because
of
the
compact
concluded
june
whereby
that
republic
and
those
of
salvador
and
honduras
forming
what
is
known
as
the
greater
republic
of
central
america
had
surrendered
to
the
representative
diet
thereof
their
right
to
receive
and
send
diplomatic
agents
the
diet
was
not
willing
to
accept
him
because
he
was
not
accredited
to
that
body
i
could
not
accredit
him
to
that
body
because
the
appropriation
law
of
congress
did
not
permit
it
mr
baker
the
present
minister
at
managua
has
been
directed
to
present
his
letters
of
recall
mr
w
godfrey
hunter
has
likewise
been
accredited
to
the
governments
of
guatemala
and
honduras
the
same
as
his
predecessor
guatemala
is
not
a
member
of
the
greater
republic
of
central
america
but
honduras
is
should
this
latter
government
decline
to
receive
him
he
has
been
instructed
to
report
this
fact
to
his
government
and
await
its
further
instructions
a
subject
of
large
importance
to
our
country
and
increasing
appreciation
on
the
part
of
the
people
is
the
completion
of
the
great
highway
of
trade
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
known
as
the
nicaragua
canal
its
utility
and
value
to
american
commerce
is
universally
admitted
the

of

authorized

in

i
shall
take
occasion
to
transmit
to

the
report
of
this
commission
making
at
the
same
time
such
further
suggestions
as
may
then
seem
advisable
under
the
provisions
of

hon
edward

e
stevenson
of

and
hon
charles
j
paine
of

as
special
envoys
to
represent
the

they
have
been
diligent
in
their
efforts
to
secure
the
concurrence
and
cooperation
of
european
countries
in
the
international
settlement
of
the
question
but
up
to
this
time
have
not
been
able
to
secure
an
agreement
contemplated
by
their
mission
the
gratifying
action
of
our
great
sister
republic
of
france
in
joining
this
country
in
the
attempt
to
bring
about
an
agreement
among
the
principal
commercial
nations
of
europe
whereby
a
fixed
and
relative
value
between
gold
and
silver
shall
be
secured
furnishes
assurance
that
we
are
not
alone
among
the
larger
nations
of
the
world
in
realizing
the
international
character
of
the
problem
and
in
the
desire
of
reaching
some
wise
and
practical
solution
of
it
the
british
government
has
published
a
resume
of
the
steps
taken
jointly
by
the
french
ambassador
in
london
and
the
special
envoys
of
the
united
states
with
whom
our
ambassador
at
london
actively
cooperated
in
the
presentation
of
this
subject
to
her
majestys
government
this
will
be
laid
before
congress
our
special
envoys
have
not
made
their
final
report
as
further
negotiations
between
the
representatives
of
this
government
and
the
governments
of
other
countries
are
pending
and
in
contemplation
they
believe
that
doubts
which
have
been
raised
in
certain
quarters
respecting
the
position
of
maintaining
the
stability
of
the
parity
between
the
metals
and
kindred
questions
may
yet
be
solved
by
further
negotiations
meanwhile
it
gives
me
satisfaction
to
state
that
the
special
envoys
have
already
demonstrated
their
ability
and
fitness
to
deal
with
the
subject
and
it
is
to
be
earnestly
hoped
that
their
labors
may
result
in
an
international
agreement
which
will
bring
about
recognition
of
both
gold
and
silver
as
money
upon
such
terms
and
with
such
safeguards
as
will
secure
the
use
of
both
metals
upon
a
basis
which
shall
work
no
injustice
to
any
class
of
our
citizens
in
order
to
execute
as
early
as
possible
the
provisions
of
the
third
and
fourth
sections
of
the
revenue
act
approved
july
i
appointed
the
hon
john
a
kasson
of
iowa
a
special
commissioner
plenipotentiary
to
undertake
the
requisite
negotiations
with
foreign
countries
desiring
to
avail
themselves
of
these
provisions
the
negotiations
are
now
proceeding
with
several
governments
both
european
and
american
it
is
believed
that
by
a
careful
exercise
of
the
powers
conferred
by
that
act
some
grievances
of
our
own
and
of
other
countries
in
our
mutual
trade
relations
may
be
either
removed
or
largely
alleviated
and
that
the
volume
of
our
commercial
exchanges
may
be
enlarged
with
advantage
to
both
contracting
parties
most
desirable
from
every
standpoint
of
national
interest
and
patriotism
is
the
effort
to
extend
our
foreign
commerce
to
this
end
our
merchant
marine
should
be
improved
and
enlarged
we
should
do
our
full
share
of
the
carrying
trade
of
the
world
we
do
not
do
it
now
we
should
be
the
laggard
no
longer
the
inferiority
of
our
merchant
marine
is
justly
humiliating
to
the
national
pride
the
government
by
every
proper
constitutional
means
should
aid
in
making
our
ships
familiar
visitors
at
every
commercial
port
of
the
world
thus
opening
up
new
and
valuable
markets
to
the
surplus
products
of
the
farm
and
the
factory
the
efforts
which
had
been
made
during
the
two
previous
years
by
my
predecessor
to
secure
better
protection
to
the
fur
seals
in
the
north
pacific
ocean
and
bering
sea
were
renewed
at
an
early
date
by
this
administration
and
have
been
pursued
with
earnestness
upon
my
invitation
the
governments
of
japan
and
russia
sent
delegates
to
washington
and
an
international
conference
was
held
during
the
months
of
october
and
november
last
wherein
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
under
the
existing
regulations
this
species
of
useful
animals
was
threatened
with
extinction
and
that
an
international
agreement
of
all
the
interested
powers
was
necessary
for
their
adequate
protection
the
government
of
great
britain
did
not
see
proper
to
be
represented
at
this
conference
but
subsequently
sent
to
washington
as
delegates
the
expert
commissioners
of
great
britain
and
canada
who
had
during
the
past
two
years
visited
the
pribilof
islands
and
who
met
in
conference
similar
commissioners
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
the
result
of
this
conference
was
an
agreement
on
important
facts
connected
with
the
condition
of
the
seal
herd
heretofore
in
dispute
which
should
place
beyond
controversy
the
duty
of
the
governments
concerned
to
adopt
measures
without
delay
for
the
preservation
and
restoration
of
the
herd
negotiations
to
this
end
are
now
in
progress
the
result
of
which
i
hope
to
be
able
to
report
to
congress
at
an
early
day
international
arbitration
cannot
be
omitted
from
the
list
of
subjects
claiming
our
consideration
events
have
only
served
to
strengthen
the
general
views
on
this
question
expressed
in
my
inaugural
address
the
best
sentiment
of
the
civilized
world
is
moving
toward
the
settlement
of
differences
between
nations
without
resorting
to
the
horrors
of
war
treaties
embodying
these
humane
principles
on
broad
lines
without
in
any
way
imperiling
our
interests
or
our
honor
shall
have
my
constant
encouragement
the
acceptance
by
this
government
of
the
invitation
of
the
republic
of
france
to
participate
in
the
universal
exposition
of
at
paris
was
immediately
followed
by
the
appointment
of
a
special
commissioner
to
represent
the
united
states
in
the
proposed
exposition
with
special
reference
to
the
securing
of
space
for
an
adequate
exhibit
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
the
special
commissioner
delayed
his
departure
for
paris
long
enough
to
ascertain
the
probable
demand
for
space
by
american
exhibitors
his
inquiries
developed
an
almost
unprecedented
interest
in
the
proposed
exposition
and
the
information
thus
acquired
enabled
him
to
justify
an
application
for
a
much
larger
allotment
of
space
for
the
american
section
than
had
been
reserved
by
the
exposition
authorities
the
result
was
particularly
gratifying
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
was
one
of
the
last
countries
to
accept
the
invitation
of
france
the
reception
accorded
our
special
commissioner
was
most
cordial
and
he
was
given
every
reasonable
assurance
that
the
united
states
would
receive
a
consideration
commensurate
with
the
proportions
of
our
exhibit
the
report
of
the
special
commissioner
as
to
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
the
coming
exposition
and
the
great
demand
for
space
by
american
exhibitors
supplies
new
arguments
for
a
liberal
and
judicious
appropriation
by
congress
to
the
end
that
an
exhibit
fairly
representative
of
the
industries
and
resources
of
our
country
may

be
made
in
an
exposition
which
will
illustrate
the
worlds
progress
during
the
nineteenth
century
that
exposition
is
intended
to
be
the
most
important
and
comprehensive
of
the
long
series
of
international
exhibitions
of
which
our
own
at
chicago
was
a
brilliant
example
and
it
is
desirable
that
the
united
states
should
make
a
worthy
exhibit
of
american
genius
and
skill
and
their
unrivaled
achievements
in
every
branch
of
industry
the
present
immediately
effective
force
of
the
navy
consists
of
four
battle
ships
of
the
first
class
two
of
the
second
and
fortyeight
other
vessels
ranging
from
armored
cruisers
to
torpedo
boats
there
are
under
construction
five
battle
ships
of
the
first
class
sixteen
torpedo
boats
and
one
submarine
boat
no
provision
has
yet
been
made
for
the
armor
of
three
of
the
five
battle
ships
as
it
has
been
impossible
to
obtain
it
at
the
price
fixed
by
congress
it
is
of
great
importance
that
congress
provide
this
armor
as
until
then
the
ships
are
of
no
fighting
value
the
present
naval
force
especially
in
view
of
its
increase
by
the
ships
now
under
construction
while
not
as
large
as
that
of
a
few
other
powers
is
a
formidable
force
its
vessels
are
the
very
best
of
each
type
and
with
the
increase
that
should
be
made
to
it
from
time
to
time
in
the
future
and
careful
attention
to
keeping
it
in
a
high
state
of
efficiency
and
repair
it
is
well
adapted
to
the
necessities
of
the
country
the
great
increase
of
the
navy
which
has
taken
place
in
recent
years
was
justified
by
the
requirements
for
national
defense
and
has
received
public
approbation
the
time
has
now
arrived
however
when
this
increase
to
which
the
country
is
committed
should
for
a
time
take
the
form
of
increased
facilities
commensurate
with
the
increase
of
our
naval
vessels
it
is
an
unfortunate
fact
that
there
is
only
one
dock
on
the
pacific
coast
capable
of
docking
our
largest
ships
and
only
one
on
the
atlantic
coast
and
that
the
latter
has
for
the
last
six
or
seven
months
been
under
repair
and
therefore
incapable
of
use
immediate
steps
should
be
taken
to
provide
three
or
four
docks
of
this
capacity
on
the
atlantic
coast
at
least
one
on
the
pacific
coast
and
a
floating
dock
in
the
gulf
this
is
the
recommendation
of
a
very
competent
board
appointed
to
investigate
the
subject
there
should
also
be
ample
provision
made
for
powder
and
projectiles
and
other
munitions
of
war
and
for
an
increased
number
of
officers
and
enlisted
men
some
additions
are
also
necessary
to
our
navyyards
for
the
repair
and
care
of
our
large
number
of
vessels
as
there
are
now
on
the
stocks
five
battle
ships
of
the
largest
class
which
cannot
be
completed
for
a
year
or
two
i
concur
with
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
an
appropriation
authorizing
the
construction
of
one
battle
ship
for
the
pacific
coast
where
at
present
there
is
only
one
in
commission
and
one
under
construction
while
on
the
atlantic
coast
there
are
three
in
commission
and
four
under
construction
and
also
that
several
torpedo
boats
be
authorized
in
connection
with
our
general
system
of
coast
defense
the
territory
of
alaska
requires
the
prompt
and
early
attention
of
congress
the
conditions
now
existing
demand
material
changes
in
the
laws
relating
to
the
territory
the
great
influx
of
population
during
the
past
summer
and
fall
and
the
prospect
of
a
still
larger
immigration
in
the
spring
will
not
permit
us
to
longer
neglect
the
extension
of
civil
authority
within
the
territory
or
postpone
the
establishment
of
a
more
thorough
government
a
general
system
of
public
surveys
has
not
yet
been
extended
to
alaska
and
all
entries
thus
far
made
in
that
district
are
upon
special
surveys
the
act
of
congress
extending
to
alaska
the
mining
laws
of
the
united
states
contained
the
reservation
that
it
should
not
be
construed
to
put
in
force
the
general
land
laws
of
the
country
by
act
approved
march
authority
was
given
for
entry
of
lands
for
townsite
purposes
and
also
for
the
purchase
of
not
exceeding
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
then
or
thereafter
occupied
for
purposes
of
trade
and
manufacture
the
purpose
of
congress
as
thus
far
expressed
has
been
that
only
such
rights
should
apply
to
that
territory
as
should
be
specifically
named
it
will
be
seen
how
much
remains
to
be
done
for
that
vast
and
remote
and
yet
promising
portion
of
our
country
special
authority
was
given
to
the
president
by
the
act
of
congress
approved
july
to
divide
that
territory
into
two
land
districts
and
to
designate
the
boundaries
thereof
and
to
appoint
registers
and
receivers
of
said
land
offices
and
the
president
was
also
authorized
to
appoint
a
surveyorgeneral
for
the
entire
district
pursuant
to
this
authority
a
surveyorgeneral
and
receiver
have
been
appointed
with
offices
at
sitka
if
in
the
ensuing
year
the
conditions
justify
it
the
additional
land
district
authorized
by
law
will
be
established
with
an
office
at
some
point
in
the
yukon
valley
no
appropriation
however
was
made
for
this
purpose
and
that
is
now
necessary
to
be
done
for
the
two
land
districts
into
which
the
territory
is
to
be
divided
i
concur
with
the
secretary
of
war
in
his
suggestions
as
to
the
necessity
for
a
military
force
in
the
territory
of
alaska
for
the
protection
of
persons
and
property
already
a
small
force
consisting
of
twentyfive
men
with
two
officers
under
command
of
lieutenantcolonel
randall
of
the
eighth
infantry
has
been
sent
to
st
michael
to
establish
a
military
post
as
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
government
to
encourage
the
development
and
settlement
of
the
country
and
its
duty
to
follow
up
its
citizens
there
with
the
benefits
of
legal
machinery
i
earnestly
urge
upon
congress
the
establishment
of
a
system
of
government
with
such
flexibility
as
will
enable
it
to
adjust
itself
to
the
future
areas
of
greatest
population
the
startling
though
possibly
exaggerated
reports
from
the
yukon
river
country
of
the
probable
shortage
of
food
for
the
large
number
of
people
who
are
wintering
there
without
the
means
of
leaving
the
country
are
confirmed
in
such
measure
as
to
justify
bringing
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
congress
access
to
that
country
in
winter
can
be
had
only
by
the
passes
from
dyea
and
vicinity
which
is
a
most
difficult
and
perhaps
an
impossible
task
however
should
these
reports
of
the
suffering
of
our
fellowcitizens
be
further
verified
every
effort
at
any
cost
should
be
made
to
carry
them
relief
for
a
number
of
years
past
it
has
been
apparent
that
the
conditions
under
which
the
five
civilized
tribes
were
established
in
the
indian
territory
under
treaty
provisions
with
the
united
states
with
the
right
of
selfgovernment
and
the
exclusion
of
all
white
persons
from
within
their
borders
have
undergone
so
complete
a
change
as
to
render
the
continuance
of
the
system
thus
inaugurated
practically
impossible
the
total
number
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
as
shown
by
the
last
census
is
and
this
number
has
not
materially
increased
while
the
white
population
is
estimated
at
from
to
which
by
permission
of
the
indian
government
has
settled
in
the
territory
the
present
area
of
the
indian
territory
contains
acres
much
of
which
is
very
fertile
land
the
united
states
citizens
residing
in
the
territory
most
of
whom
have
gone
there
by
invitation
or
with
the
consent
of
the
tribal
authorities
have
made
permanent
homes
for
themselves
numerous
towns
have
been
built
in
which
from
to
white
people
now
reside
valuable
residences
and
business
houses
have
been
erected
in
many
of
them
large
business
enterprises
are
carried
on
in
which
vast
sums
of
money
are
employed
and
yet
these
people
who
have
invested
their
capital
in
the
development
of
the
productive
resources
of
the
country
are
without
title
to
the
land
they
occupy
and
have
no
voice
whatever
in
the
government
either
of
the
nations
or
tribes
thousands
of
their
children
who
were
born
in
the
territory
are
of
school
age
but
the
doors
of
the
schools
of
the
nations
are
shut
against
them
and
what
education
they
get
is
by
private
contribution
no
provision
for
the
protection
of
the
life
or
property
of
these
white
citizens
is
made
by
the
tribal
governments
and
courts
the
secretary
of
the
interior
reports
that
leading
indians
have
absorbed
great
tracts
of
land
to
the
exclusion
of
the
common
people
and
government
by
an
indian
aristocracy
has
been
practically
established
to
the
detriment
of
the
people
it
has
been
found
impossible
for
the
united
states
to
keep
its
citizens
out
of
the
territory
and
the
executory
conditions
contained
in
the
treaties
with
these
nations
have
for
the
most
part
become
impossible
of
execution
nor
has
it
been
possible
for
the
tribal
governments
to
secure
to
each
individual
indian
his
full
enjoyment
in
common
with
other
indians
of
the
common
property
of
the
nations
friends
of
the
indians
have
long
believed
that
the
best
interests
of
the
indians
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
would
be
found
in
american
citizenship
with
all
the
rights
and
privileges
which
belong
to
that
condition
by
section
of
the
act
of
march
the
president
was
authorized
to
appoint
three
commissioners
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
the
cherokee
choctaw
chickasaw
muscogee
or
creek
and
seminole
nations
commonly
known
as
the
five
civilized
tribes
in
the
indian
territory
briefly
the
purposes
of
the
negotiations
were
to
be
the
extinguishment
of
tribal
titles
to
any
lands
within
that
territory
now
held
by
any
and
all
such
nations
or
tribes
either
by
cession
of
the
same
or
some
part
thereof
to
the
united
states
or
by
allotment
and
division
of
the
same
in
severalty
among
the
indians
of
such
nations
or
tribes
respectively
as
may
be
entitled
to
the
same
or
by
such
other
method
as
may
be
agreed
upon
between
the
several
nations
and
tribes
aforesaid
or
each
of
them
with
the
united
states
with
a
view
to
such
an
adjustment
upon
the
basis
of
justice
and
equity
as
may
with
the
consent
of
the
said
nations
of
indians
so
far
as
may
be
necessary
be
requisite
and
suitable
to
enable
the
ultimate
creation
of
a
state
or
states
of
the
union
which
shall
embrace
the
lands
within
said
indi
an
territory
the
commission
met
much
opposition
from
the
beginning
the
indians
were
very
slow
to
act
and
those
in
control
manifested
a
decided
disinclination
to
meet
with
favor
the
propositions
submitted
to
them
a
little
more
than
three
years
after
this
organization
the
commission
effected
an
agreement
with
the
choctaw
nation
alone
the
chickasaws
however
refused
to
agree
to
its
terms
and
as
they
have
a
common
interest
with
the
choctaws
in
the
lands
of
said
nations
the
agreement
with
the
latter
nation
could
have
no
effect
without
the
consent
of
the
former
on
april
the
commission
effected
an
agreement
with
both
tribesthe
choctaws
and
chickasaws
this
agreement
it
is
understood
has
been
ratified
by
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
respective
tribes
or
nations
parties
thereto
and
only
requires
ratification
by
congress
to
make
it
binding
on
the
th
of
september
an
agreement
was
effected
with
the
creek
nation
but
it
is
understood
that
the
national
council
of
said
nation
has
refused
to
ratify
the
same
negotiations
are
yet
to
be
had
with
the
cherokees
the
most
populous
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
and
with
the
seminoles
the
smallest
in
point
of
numbers
and
territory
the
provision
in
the
indian
appropriation
act
approved
june
makes
it
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
investigate
and
determine
the
rights
of
applicants
for
citizenship
in
the
five
civilized
tribes
and
to
make
complete
census
rolls
of
the
citizens
of
said
tribes
the
commission
is
at
present
engaged
in
this
work
among
the
creeks
and
has
made
appointments
for
taking
the
census
of
these
people
up
to
and
including
the
th
of
the
present
month
should
the
agreement
between

choctaws
and
chickasaws
be
ratified
by
congress
and
should
the
other
tribes
fail
to
make
an
agreement
with
the
commission
then
it
will
be
necessary
that
some
legislation
shall
be
had
by
congress
which
while
just
and
honorable
to
the
indians
shall
be
equitable

henry

dawes
chairman
of

commission
in
a
letter
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
date
of
october
says
individual
ownership
is
in
their
the
commissions
opinion
absolutely
essential
to
any
permanent
improvement
in
present
conditions
and
the
lack
of
it
is
the
root
of
nearly
all
the
evils
which
so
grievously
afflict
these
people
allotment
by
agreement
is
the
only
possible
method
unless
the
united

courts
are
clothed
with
the
authority
to
apportion
the
lands
among
the
citizen
indians
for
whose
use
it
was
originally
granted
i
concur
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
there
can
be
no
cure
for
the
evils
engendered
by
the
perversion
of
these
great
trusts
excepting
by
their
resumption
by
the
government
which
created
them
the
recent
prevalence
of
yellow
fever
in
a
number
of
cities
and
towns
throughout
the
south
has
resulted
in
much
disturbance
of

demonstrated
the
necessity
of
such
amendments
to

will
make
the
regulations
of

portion
of
his
report
relating
to
the
operation
of
the
marine
hospital
service
calls
attention
to
the
defects
in
the
present
quarantine
laws
and
recommends
amendments
thereto
which
will
give
the
treasury
department
the
requisite
authority
to
prevent
the
invasion
of
epidemic
diseases
from
foreign
countries
and
in
times
of
emergency
like
that
of
the
past
summer
will
add
to
the
efficiency
of
the
sanitary
measures
for
the
protection
of
the
people
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
unnecessary
restriction
of
commerce
i
concur
in
his
recommendation
in
further
effort
to
prevent
the
invasion
of
the
united
states
by
yellow
fever
the
importance
of
the
discovery
of
the
exact
cause
of
the
disease
which
up
to
the
present
time
has
been
undetermined
is
obvious
and
to
this
end
a
systematic
bacteriological
investigation
should
be
made
i
therefore
recommend
that
congress
authorize
the
appointment
of
a
commission
by
the
president
to
consist
of
four
expert
bacteriologists
one
to
be
selected
from
the
medical
officers
of
the
marine
hospital
service
one
to
be
appointed
from
civil
life
one
to
be
detailed
from
the
medical
officers
of
the
army
and
one
from
the
medical
officers
of
the
navy
the
union
pacific
railway
main
line
was
sold
under
the
decree
of
the
united
states
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
on
the
st
and
d
of
november
of
this
year
the
amount
due
the
government
consisted
of
the
principal
of
the
subsidy
bonds
and
the
accrued
interest
thereon
making
the
total
indebtedness
the
bid
at
the
sale
covered
the
first
mortgage
lien
and
the
entire
mortgage
claim
of
the
government
principal
and
interest
the
sale
of
the
subsidized
portion
of
the
kansas
pacific
line
upon
which
the
government
holds
a
second
mortgage
lien
has
been
postponed
at
the
instance
of
the
government
to
december
the
debt
of
this
division
of
the
union
pacific
railway
to
the
government
on
november
was
the
principal
of
the
subsidy
bonds
and
the
unpaid
and
accrued
interest
thereon
making
a
total
of
the
sale
of
this
road
was
originally
advertised
for
november
but
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
utmost
public
notice
of
the
event
it
was
postponed
until
december
and
a
second
advertisement
of
the
sale
was
made
by
the
decree
of
the
court
the
upset
price
on
the
sale
of
the
kansas
pacific
will
yield
to
the
government
the
sum
of
over
all
prior
liens
costs
and
charges
if
no
other
or
better
bid
is
made
this
sum
is
all
that
the
government
will
receive
on
its
claim
of
nearly
the
government
has
no
information
as
to
whether
there
will
be
other
bidders
or
a
better
bid
than
the
minimum
amount
herein
stated
the
question
presented
therefore
is
whether
the
government
shall
under
the
authority
given
it
by
the
act
of
march
purchase
or
redeem
the
road
in
the
event
that
a
bid
is
not
made
by
private
parties
covering
the
entire
government
claim
to
qualify
the
government
to
bid
at
the
sales
will
require
a
deposit
of
as
follows
in
the
government
cause
and
in
each
of
the
first
mortgage
causes
and
in
the
latter
the
deposit
must
be
in
cash
payments
at
the
sale
are
as
follows
upon
the
acceptance
of
the
bid
a
sum
which
with
the
amount
already
deposited
shall
equal
fifteen
per
cent
of
the
bid
the
balance
in
installments
of
twentyfive
per
cent
thirty
forty
and
fifty
days
after
the
confirmation
of
the
sale
the
lien
on
the
kansas
pacific
prior
to
that
of
the
government
on
the
th
july
principal
and
interest
amounted
to
the
government
therefore
should
it
become
the
highest
bidder
will
have
to
pay
the
amount
of
the
first
mortgage
lien
i
believe
that
under
the
act
of
it
has
the
authority
to
do
this
and
in
absence
of
any
action
by
congress
i
shall
direct
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
make
the
necessary
deposit
as
required
by
the
courts
decree
to
qualify
as
a
bidder
and
to
bid
at
the
sale
a
sum
which
will
at
least
equal
the
principal
of
the
debt
due
to
the
government
but
suggest
in
order
to
remove
all
controversy
that
an
amendment
of
the
law
be
immediately
passed
explicitly
giving
such
powers
and
appropriating
in
general
terms
whatever
sum
is
sufficient
therefor
in
so
important
a
matter
as
the
government
becoming
the
possible
owner
of
railroad
property
which
it
perforce
must
conduct
and
operate
i
feel
constrained
to
lay
before
congress
these
facts
for
its
consideration
and
action
before
the
consummation
of
the
sale
it
is
clear
to
my
mind
that
the
government
should
not
permit
the
property
to
be
sold
at
a
price
which
will
yield
less
than
onehalf
of
the
principal
of
its
debt
and
less
than
onefifth
of
its
entire
debt
principal
and
interest
but
whether
the
government
rather
than
accept
less
than
its
claim
should
become
a
bidder
and
thereby
the
owner
of
the
property
i
submit
to
the
congress
for
action
the
library
building
provided
for
by
the
act
of
congress
approved
april
has
been
completed
and
opened
to
the
public
it
should
be
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
through
the
foresight
and
munificence
of
congress
the
nation
possesses
this
noble
treasurehouse
of
knowledge
it
is
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
having
done
so
much
toward
the
cause
of
education
congress
will
continue
to
develop
the
library
in
every
phase
of
research
to
the
end
that
it
may
be
not
only
one
of
the
most
magnificent
but
among
the
richest
and
most
useful
libraries
in
the
world
the
important
branch
of
our
government
known
as
the
civil
service
the
practical
improvement
of
which
has
long
been
a
subject
of
earnest
discussion
has
of
late
years
received
increased
legislative
and
executive
approval
during
the
past
few
months
the
service
has
been
placed
upon
a
still
firmer
basis
of
business
methods
and
personal
merit
while
the
right
of
our
veteran
soldiers
to
reinstatement
in
deserving
cases
has
been
asserted
dismissals
for
merely
political
reasons
have
been
carefully
guarded
against
the
examinations
for
admittance
to
the
service
enlarged
and
at
the
same
time
rendered
less
technical
and
more
practical
and
a
distinct
advance
has
been
made
by
giving
a
hearing
before
dismissal
upon
all
cases
where
incompetency
is
charged
or
demand
made
for
the
removal
of
officials
in
any
of
the
departments
this
order
has
been
made
to
give
to
the
accused
his
right
to
be
heard
but
without
in
anyway
impairing
the
power
of
removal
which
should
always
be
exercised
in
cases
of
inefficiency
and
incompetency
and
which
is
one
of
the
vital
safeguards
of
the
civil
service
reform
system
preventing
stagnation
and
deadwood
and
keeping
every
employee
keenly
alive
to
the
fact
that
the
security
of
his
tenure
depends
not
on
favor
but
on
his
own
tested
and
carefully
watched
record
of
service
much
of
course
still
remains
to
be
accomplished
before
the
system
can
be
made
reasonably
perfect
for
our
needs
there
are
places
now
in
the
classified
service
which
ought
to
be
exempted
and
others
not
classified
may
properly
be
included
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
exempt
cases
which
i
think
have
been
improperly
included
in
the
classified
service
or
include
those
which
in
my
judgment
will
best
promote
the
publ
ic
service
the
system
has
the
approval
of
the
people
and
it
will
be
my
endeavor
to
uphold
and
extend
it
i
am
forced
by
the
length
of
this
message
to
omit
many
important
references
to
affairs
of
the
government
with
which
congress
will
have
to
deal
at
the
present
session
they
are
fully
discussed
in
the
departmental
reports
to
all
of
which
i
invite
your
earnest
attention
the
estimates
of
the
expenses
of
the
government
by
the
several
departments
will
i
am
sure
have
your
careful
scrutiny
while
the
congress
may
not
find
it
an
easy
task
to
reduce
the
expenses
of
the
government
it
should
not
encourage
their
increase
these
expenses
will
in
my
judgment
admit
of
a
decrease
in
many
branches
of
the
government
without
injury
to
the
public
service
it
is
a
commanding
duty
to
keep
the
appropriations
within
the
receipts
of
the
government
and
thus
avoid
a
deficit

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
submitting
my
annual
message
to
congress
i
have
great
satisfaction
in
being
able
to
say
that
the
general
conditions
affecting
the
commercial
and
industrial
interests
of
the
united
states
are
in
the
highest
degree
favorable
a
comparison
of
the
existing
conditions
with
those
of
the
most
favored
period
in
the
history
of
the
country
will
i
believe
show
that
so
high
a
degree
of
prosperity
and
so
general
a
diffusion
of
the
comforts
of
life
were
never
before

another
indication

or
by
their
power
to
supply
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
it
is
true
that
the
market
prices
of
cotton
and
wheat
have
been
low
it
is
one
of
the
unfavorable
incidents
of
agriculture
that
the
farmer
can
not
produce
upon
orders
he
must
sow
and
reap
in
ignorance
of
the
aggregate
production
of
the
year
and
is
peculiarly
subject
to
the
depreciation
which
follows
overproduction
but
while
the
fact
i
have
stated
is
true
as
to
the
crops
mentioned
the
general
average
of
prices
has
been
such
as
to
give
to
agriculture
a
fair
participation
in
the
general
prosperity
the
value
of
our
total
farm
products
has
increased
from
in
to
in
as
estimated
by
statisticians
an
increase
of
per
cent
the
number
of
hogs
january
was
and
their
value
on
january
the
number
was
and
the
value
on
january
the
number
of
cattle
was
and
the
value
on
january
the
number
was
and
the
value
if
any
are
discontented
with
their
state
here
if
any
believe
that
wages
or
prices
the
returns
for
honest
toil
are
inadequate
they
should
not
fail
to
remember
that
there
is
no
other
country
in
the
world
where
the
conditions
that
seem
to
them
hard
would
not
be
accepted
as
highly
prosperous
the
english
agriculturist
would
be
glad
to
exchange
the
returns
of
his
labor
for
those
of
the
american
farmer
and
the
manchester
workmen
their
wages
for
those
of
their
fellows
at
fall
river
i
believe
that
the
protective
system
which
has
now
for
something
more
than
thirty
years
continuously
prevailed
in
our
legislation
has
been
a
mighty
instrument
for
the
development
of
our
national
wealth
and
a
most
powerful
agency
in
protecting
the
homes
of
our
workingmen
from
the
invasion
of
want
i
have
felt
a
most
solicitous
interest
to
preserve
to
our
working
people
rates
of
wages
that
would
not
only
give
daily
bread
but
supply
a
comfortable
margin
for
those
home
attractions
and
family
comforts
and
enjoyments
without
which
life
is
neither
hopeful
nor
sweet
they
are
american
citizensa
part
of
the
great
people
for
whom
our
constitution
and
government
were
framed
and
institutedand
it
can
not
be
a
perversion
of
that
constitution
to
so
legislate
as
to
preserve
in
their
homes
the
comfort
independence
loyalty
and
sense
of
interest
in
the
government
which
are
essential
to
good
citizenship
in
peace
and
which
will
bring
this
stalwart
throng
as
in
to
the
defense
of
the
flag
when
it
is
assailed
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
renew
here
the
argument
in
favor
of
a
protective
tariff
the
result
of
the
recent
election
must
be
accepted
as
having
introdu
ced
a
new
policy
we
must
assume
that
the
present
tariff
constructed
upon
the
lines
of
protection
is
to
be
repealed
and
that
there
is
to
be
substituted
for
it
a
tariff
law
constructed
solely
with
reference
to
revenue
that
no
duty
is
to
be
higher
because
the
increase
will
keep
open
an
american
mill
or
keep
up
the
wages
of
an
american
workman
but
that
in
every
case
such
a
rate
of
duty
is
to
be
imposed
as
will
bring
to
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
the
largest
returns
of
revenue
the
contention
has
not
been
between
schedules
but
between
principles
and
it
would
be
offensive
to
suggest
that
the
prevailing
party
will
not
carry
into
legislation
the
principles
advocated
by
it
and
the
pledges
given
to
the
people
the
tariff
bills
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives
at
the
last
session
were
as
i
suppose
even
in
the
opinion
of
their
promoters
inadequate
and
justified
only
by
the
fact
that
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
were
not
in
accord
and
that
a
general
revision
could
not
therefore
be
undertaken
i
recommend
that
the
whole
subject
of
tariff
revision
be
left
to
the
incoming
congress
it
is
matter
of
regret
that
this
work
must
be
delayed
for
at
least
three
months
for
the
threat
of
great
tariff
changes
introduces
so
much
uncertainty
that
an
amount
not
easily
estimated
of
business
inaction
and
of
diminished
production
will
necessarily
result
it
is
possible
also
that
this
uncertainty
may
result
in
decreased
revenues
from
customs
duties
for
our
merchants
will
make
cautious
orders
for
foreign
goods
in
view
of
the
prospect
of
tariff
reductions
and
the
uncertainty
as
to
when
they
will
take
effect
those
who
have
advocated
a
protective
tariff
can
well
afford
to
have
their
disastrous
forecasts
of
a
change
of
policy
disappointed
if
a
system
of
customs
duties
can
be
framed
that
will
set
the
idle
wheels
and
looms
of
europe
in
motion
and
crowd
our
warehouses
with
foreignmade
goods
and
at
the
same
time
keep
our
own
mills
busy
that
will
give
us
an
increased
participation
in
the
markets
of
the
world
of
greater
value
than
the
home
market
we
surrender
that
will
give
increased
work
to
foreign
workmen
upon
products
to
be
consumed
by
our
people
without
diminishing
the
amount
of
work
to
be
done
here
that
will
enable
the
american
manufacturer
to
pay
to
his
workmen
from
to
per
cent
more
in
wages
than
is
paid
in
the
foreign
mill
and
yet
to
compete
in
our
market
and
in
foreign
markets
with
the
foreign
producer
that
will
further
reduce
the
cost
of
articles
of
wear
and
food
without
reducing
the
wages
of
those
who
produce
them
that
can
be
celebrated
after
its
effects
have
been
realized
as
its
expectation
has
been
in
european
as
well
as
in
american
cities
the
authors
and
promoters
of
it
will
be
entitled
to
the
highest
praise
we
have
had
in
our
history
several
experiences
of
the
contrasted
effects
of
a
revenue
and
of
a
protective
tariff
but
this
generation
has
not
felt
them
and
the
experience
of
one
generation
is
not
highly
instructive
to
the
next
the
friends
of
the
protective
system
with
undiminished
confidence
in
the
principles
they
have
advocated
will
await
the
results
of
the
new
experiment
the
strained
and
too
often
disturbed
relations
existing
between
the
employees
and
the
employers
in
our
great
manufacturing
establishments
have
not
been
favorable
to
a
calm
consideration
by
the
wage
earner
of
the
effect
upon
wages
of
the
protective
system
the
facts
that
his
wages
were
the
highest
paid
in
like
callings
in
the
world
and
that
a
maintenance
of
this
rate
of
wages
in
the
absence
of
protective
duties
upon
the
product
of
his
labor
was
impossible
were
obscured
by
the
passion
evoked
by
these
contests
he
may
now
be
able
to
review
the
question
in
the
light
of
his
personal
experience
under
the
operation
of
a
tariff
for
revenue
only
if
that
experience
shall
demonstrate
that
present
rates
of
wages
are
thereby
maintained
or
increased
either
absolutely
or
in
their
purchasing
power
and
that
the
aggregate
volume
of
work
to
be
done
in
this
country
is
increased
or
even
maintained
so
that
there
are
more
or
as
many
days
work
in
a
year
at
as
good
or
better
wages
for
the
american
workmen
as
has
been
the
case
under
the
protective
system
everyone
will
rejoice
a
general
process
of
wage
reduction
can
not
be
contemplated
by
any
patriotic
citizen
without
the
gravest
apprehension
it
may
be
indeed
i
believe
is
possible
for
the
american
manufacturer
to
compete
successfully
with
his
foreign
rival
in
many
branches
of
production
without
the
defense
of
protective
duties
if
the
pay
rolls
are
equalized
but
the
conflict
that
stands
between
the
producer
and
that
result
and
the
distress
of
our
working
people
when
it
is
attained
are
not
pleasant
to
contemplate
the
society
of
the
unemployed
now
holding
its
frequent
and
threatening
parades
in
the
streets
of
foreign
cities
should
not
be
allowed
to
acquire
an
american
domicile
the
reports
of
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
which
are
herewith
submitted
have
very
naturally
included
a
resume
of
the
whole
work
of
the
administration
with
the
transactions
of
the
last
fiscal
year
the
attention
not
only
of
congress
but
of
the
country
is
again
invited
to
the
methods
of
administration
which
have
been
pursued
and
to
the
results
which
have
been
attained
public
revenues
amounting
to
have
been
collected
and
disbursed
without
loss
from
misappropriation
without
a
single
defalcation
of
such
importance
as
to
attract
the
public
attention
and
at
a
diminished
per
cent
of
cost
for
collection
the
public
business
has
been
transacted
not
only
with
fidelity
but
progressively
and
with
a
view
to
giving
to
the
people
in
the
fullest
possible
degree
the
benefits
of
a
service
established
and
maintained
for
their
protection
and
comfort
our
relations
with
other
nations
are
now
undisturbed
by
any
serious
controversy
the
complicated
and
threatening
differences
with
germany
and
england
relating
to
samoan
affairs
with
england
in
relation
to
the
seal
fisheries
in
the
bering
sea
and
with
chile
growing
out
of
the
baltimore
affair
have
been
adjusted
there
have
been
negotiated
and
concluded
under
section
of
the
tariff
law
commercial
agreements
relating
to
reciprocal
trade
with
the
following
countries
brazil
dominican
republic
spain
for
cuba
and
puerto
rico
guatemala
salvador
the
german
empire
great
britain
for
certain
west
indian
colonies
and
british
guiana
nicaragua
honduras
and
austriahungary
of
these
those
with
guatemala
salvador
the
german
empire
great
britain
nicaragua
honduras
and
austriahungary
have
been
concluded
since
my
last
annual
message
under
these
trade
arrangements
a
free
or
favored
admission
has
been
secured
in
every
case
for
an
important
list
of
american
products
especial
care
has
been
taken
to
secure
markets
for
farm
products
in
order
to
relieve
that
great
underlying
industry
of
the
depression
which
the
lack
of
an
adequate
foreign
market
for
our
surplus
often
brings
an
opening
has
also
been
made
for
manufactured
products
that
will
undoubtedly
if
this
policy
is
maintained
greatly
augment
our
export
trade
the
full
benefits
of
these
arrangements
can
not
be
realized
instantly
new
lines
of
trade
are
to
be
opened
the
commercial
traveler
must
survey
the
field
the
manufacturer
must
adapt
his
goods
to
the
new
markets
and
facilities
for
exchange
must
be
established
this
work
has
been
well
begun
our
merchants
and
manufacturers
having
entered
the
new
fields
with
courage
and
enterprise
in
the
case
of
food
products
and
especially
with
cuba
the
trade
did
not
need
to
wait
and
the
immediate
results
have
been
most
gratifying
if
this
policy
and
these
trade
arrangements
can
be
continued
in
force
and
aided
by
the
establishment
of
american
steamship
lines
i
do
not
doubt
that
we
shall
within
a
short
period
secure
fully
onethird
of
the
total
trade
of
the
countries
of
central
and
south
america
which
now
amounts
to
about
annually
in
we
had
only
per
cent
of
this
trade
the
following
statistics
show
the
increase
in
our
trade
with
the
countries
with
which
we
have
reciprocal
trade
agreements
from
the
date
when
such
agreements
went
into
effect
up
to
september
the
increase
being
in
some
almost
wholly
and
in
others
in
an
important
degree
the
result
of
these
agreements
the
domestic
exports
to
germany
and
austriahungary
have
increased
in
value
from
to
an
increase
of
or
per
cent
with
american
countries
the
value
of
our
exports
has
increased
from
to
an
increase
of
or
per
cent
the
total
increase
in
the
value
of
exports
to
all
the
countries
with
which
we
have
reciprocity
agreements
has
been
this
increase
is
chiefly
in
wheat
flour
meat
and
dairy
products
and
in
manufactures
of
iron
and
steel
and
lumber
there
has
been
a
large
increase
in
the
value
of
imports
from
all
these
countries
since
the
commercial
agreements
went
into
effect
amounting
to
but
it
has
been
entirely
in
imports
from
the
american
countries
consisting
mostly
of
sugar
coffee
india
rubber
and
crude
drugs
the
alarmed
attention
of
our
european
competitors
for
the
south
american
market
has
been
attracted
to
this
new
american
policy
and
to
our
acquisition
and
their

of

trade
a
treaty
providing
for
the
arbitration
of
the
dispute
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
as
to
the
killing
of
seals
in
the
bering
sea
was
concluded
on
the
th
of
february
last
this
treaty
was
accompanied
by
an
agreement
prohibiting
pelagic
sealing
pending
the
arbitration
and
a
vigorous
effort
was
made
during
this
season
to
drive
out
all
poaching
sealers
from
the
bering
sea
six
naval
vessels
three
revenue
cutters
and
one
vessel
from
the
fish
commission
all
under
the
command
of
commander
evans
of
the
navy
were
sent
into
the
sea
which
was
systematically
patrolled
some
seizures
were
made
and
it
is
believed
that
the
catch
in
the
bering
sea
by
poachers
amounted
to
less
than
seals
it
is
true
however
that
in
the
north
pacific
while
the
seal
herds
were
on
their
way
to
the
passes
between
the
aleutian
islands
a
very
large
number
probably
were
taken
the
existing
statutes
of
the
united
states
do
not
restrain
our
citizens
from
taking
seal
s
in
the
pacific
ocean
and
perhaps
should
not
unless
the
prohibition
can
be
extended
to
the
citizens
of
other
nations
i
recommend
that
power
be
given
to
the
president
by
proclamation
to
prohibit
the
taking
of
seals
in
the
north
pacific
by
american
vessels
in
case
either
as
the
result
of
the
findings
of
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
or
otherwise
the
restraints
can
be
applied
to
the
vessels
of
all
countries
the
case
of
the
united
states
for
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
has
been
prepared
with
great
care
and
industry
by
the
hon
john
w
foster
and
the
counsel
who
represent
this
government
express
confidence
that
a
result
substantially
establishing
our
claims
and
preserving
this
great
industry
for
the
benefit
of
all
nations
will
be
attained
during
the
past
year
a
suggestion
was
received
through
the
british
minister
that
the
canadian
government
would
like
to
confer
as
to
the
possibility
of
enlarging
upon
terms
of
mutual
advantage
the
commercial
exchanges
of
canada
and
of
the
united
states
and
a
conference
was
held
at
washington
with
mr
blaine
acting
for
this
government
and
the
british
minister
at
this
capital
and
three
members
of
the
dominion
cabinet
acting
as
commissioners
on
the
part
of
great
britain
the
conference
developed
the
fact
that
the
canadian
government
was
only
prepared
to
offer
to
the
united
states
in
exchange
for
the
concessions
asked
the
admission
of
natural
products
the
statement
was
frankly
made
that
favored
rates
could
not
be
given
to
the
united
states
as
against
the
mother
country
this
admission
which
was
foreseen
necessarily
terminated
the
conference
upon
this
question
the
benefits
of
an
exchange
of
natural
products
would
be
almost
wholly
with
the
people
of
canada
some
other
topics
of
interest
were
considered
in
the
conference
and
have
resulted
in
the
making
of
a
convention
for
examining
the
alaskan
boundary
and
the
waters
of
passamaquoddy
bay
adjacent
to
eastport
me
and
in
the
initiation
of
an
arrangement
for
the
protection
of
fish
life
in
the
coterminous
and
neighboring
waters
of
our
northern
border
the
controversy
as
to
tolls
upon
the
welland
canal
which
was
presented
to
congress
at
the
last
session
by
special
message
having
failed
of
adjustment
i
felt
constrained
to
exercise
the
authority
conferred
by
the
act
of
july
and
to
proclaim
a
suspension
of
the
free
use
of
st
marys
falls
canal
to
cargoes
in
transit
to
ports
in
canada
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
established
such
tolls
as
were
thought
to
be
equivalent
to
the
exactions
unjustly
levied
upon
our
commerce
in
the
canadian
canals
if
as
we
must
suppose
the
political
relations
of
canada
and
the
disposition
of
the
canadian
government
are
to
remain
unchanged
a
somewhat
radical
revision
of
our
trade
relations
should
i
think
be
made
our
relations
must
continue
to
be
intimate
and
they
should
be
friendly
i
regret
to
say
however
that
in
many
of
the
controversies
notably
those
as
to
the
fisheries
on
the
atlantic
the
sealing
interests
on
the
pacific
and
the
canal
tolls
our
negotiations
with
great
britain
have
continuously
been
thwarted
or
retarded
by
unreasonable
and
unfriendly
objections
and
protests
from
canada
in
the
matter
of
the
canal
tolls
our
treaty
rights
were
flagrantly
disregarded
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
canadian
pacific
and
other
railway
lines
which
parallel
our
northern

nimmo
jr
former
chief
of
the
bureau
of
statistics
when
before
the
senate
select
committee
on
relations
with
canada
april
said
that
the
value
of
goods
thus
transported
between
different
points
in
the
united
states
across
canadian
territory
probably
amounts
to
a
year
there
is
no
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
people
or
government
of
the
united
states
to
interfere
in
the
smallest
degree
with
the
political
relations
of
canada
that
question
is
wholly
with
her
own
people
it
is
time
for
us
however
to
consider
whether
if
the
present
state
of
things
and
trend
of
things
is
to
continue
our
interchanges
upon
lines
of
land
transportation
should
not
be
put
upon
a
different
basis
and
our
entire
independence
of
canadian
canals
and
of
the
st
lawrence
as
an
outlet
to
the
sea
secured
by
the
construction
of
an
american
canal
around
the
falls
of
niagara
and
the
opening
of
ship
communication
between
the
great
lakes
and
one
of
our
own
seaports
we
should
not
hesitate
to
avail
ourselves
of
our
great
natural
trade
advantages
we
should
withdraw
the
support
which
is
given
to
the
railroads
and
steamship
lines
of
canada
by
a
traffic
that
properly
belongs
to
us
and
no
longer
furnish
the
earnings
which
lighten
the
otherwise
crushing
weight
of
the
enormous
public
subsidies
that
have
been
given
to
them
the
subject
of
the
power
of
the
treasury
to
deal
with
this
matter
without
further
legislation
has
been
under
consideration
but
circumstances
have
postponed
a
conclusion
it
is
probable
that
a
consideration
of
the
propriety
of
a
modification
or
abrogation
of
the
article
of
the
treaty
of
washington
relating
to
the
transit
of
goods
in
bond
is
involved
in
any
complete
solution
of
the
question
congress
at
the
last
session
was
kept
advised
of
the
progress
of
the
serious
and
for
a
time
threatening
difference
between
the
united
states
and
chile
it
gives
me
now
great
gratification
to
report
that
the
chilean
government
in
a
most
friendly
and
honorable
spirit
has
tendered
and
paid
as
an
indemnity
to
the
families
of
the
sailors
of
the
baltimore
who
were
killed
and
to
those
who
were
injured
in
the
outbreak
in
the
city
of
valparaiso
the
sum
of
this
has
been
accepted
not
only
as
an
indemnity
for
a
wrong
done
but
as
a
most
gratifying
evidence
that
the
government
of
chile
rightly
appreciates
the
disposition
of
this
government
to
act
in
a
spirit
of
the
most
absolute
fairness
and
friendliness
in
our
intercourse
with
that
brave
people
a
further
and
conclusive
evidence
of
the
mutual
respect
and
confidence
now
existing
is
furnished
by
the
fact
that
a
convention
submitting
to
arbitration
the
mutual
claims
of
the
citizens
of
the
respective
governments
has
been
agreed
upon
some
of
these
claims
have
been
pending
for
many
years
and
have
been
the
occasion
of
much
unsatisfactory
diplomatic
correspondence
i
have
endeavored
in
every
way
to
assure
our
sister
republics
of
central
and
south
america
that
the
united
states
government
and
its
people
have
only
the
most
friendly
disposition
toward
them
all
we
do
not
covet
their
territory
we
have
no
disposition
to
be
oppressive
or
exacting
in
our
dealings
with
any
of
them
even
the
weakest
our
interests
and
our
hopes
for
them
all
lie
in
the
direction
of
stable
governments
by
their
people
and
of
the
largest
development
of
their
great
commercial
resources
the
mutual
benefits
of
enlarged
commercial
exchanges
and
of
a
more
familiar
and
friendly
intercourse
between
our
peoples
we
do
desire
and
in
this
have
sought
their
friendly
cooperation
i
have
believed
however
while
holding
these
sentiments
in
the
greatest
sincerity
that
we
must
insist
upon
a
just
responsibility
for
any
injuries
inflicted
upon
our
official
representatives
or
upon
our
citizens
this
insistence
kindly
and
justly
but
firmly
made
will
i
believe
promote
peace
and
mutual
respect
our
relations
with
hawaii
have
been
such
as
to
attract
an
increased
interest
and
must
continue
to
do
so
i
deem
it
of
great
importance
that
the
projected
submarine
cable
a
survey
for
which
has
been
made
should
be
promoted
both
for
naval
and
commercial
uses
we
should
have
quick
communication
with
honolulu
we
should
before
this
have
availed
ourselves
of
the
concession
made
many
years
ago
to
this
government
for
a
harbor
and
naval
station
at
pearl
river
many
evidences
of
the
friendliness
of
the
hawaiian
government
have
been
given
in
the
past
and
it
is
gratifying
to
believe
that
the
advantage
and
necessity
of
a
continuance
of
very
close
relations
is
appreciated
the
friendly
act
of
this
government
in
expressing
to
the
government
of
italy
its
reprobation
and
abhorrence
of
the
lynching
of
italian
subjects
in
new
orleans
by
the
payment
of
francs
or
was
accepted
by
the
king
of
italy
with
every
manifestation
of
gracious
appreciation
and
the
incident
has
been
highly
promotive
of
mutual
respect
and
good
will
in
consequence
of
the
action
of
the
french
government
in
proclaiming
a
protectorate
over
certain
tribal
districts
of
the
west
coast
of
africa
eastward
of
the
san
pedro
river
which
has
long
been
regarded
as
the
southeastern
boundary
of
liberia
i
have
felt
constrained
to
make
protest
against
this
encroachment
upon
the
territory
of
a
republic
which
was
rounded
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
toward
which
this
country
has
for
many
years
held
the
intimate
relation
of
a
friendly
counselor
the
recent
disturbances
of
the
public
peace
by
lawless
foreign
marauders
on
the
mexican
frontier
have
afforded
this
government
an
opportunity
to
testify
its
good
will
for
mexico
and
its
earnest
purpose
to
fulfill
the
obligations
of
international
friendship
by
pursuing
and
dispersing
the
evil
doers
the
work
of
relocating
the
boundary
of
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
westward
from
el
paso
is
progressing
favorably
our
intercourse
with
spain
continues
on
a
friendly
footing
i
regret
however
not
to
be
able
to
report
as
yet
the
adjustment
of
the
cl
aims
of
the
american
missionaries
arising
from
the
disorders
at
ponape
in
the
caroline
islands
but
i
anticipate
a
satisfactory
adjustment
in
view
of
renewed
and
urgent
representations
to
the
government
at
madrid
the
treatment
of
the
religious
and
educational
establishments
of
american
citizens
in
turkey
has
of
late
called
for
a
more
than
usual
share
of
attention
a
tendency
to
curtail
the
toleration
which
has
so
beneficially
prevailed
is
discernible
and
has
called
forth
the
earnest
remonstrance
of
this
government
harassing
regulations
in
regard
to
schools
and
churches
have
been
attempted
in
certain
localities
but
not
without
due
protest
and
the
assertion
of
the
inherent
and
conventional
rights
of
our
countrymen
violations
of
domicile
and
search
of
the
persons
and
effects
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
by
apparently
irresponsible
officials
in
the
asiatic
vilayets
have
from
time
to
time
been
reported
an
aggravated
instance
of
injury
to
the
property
of
an
american
missionary
at
bourdour
in
the
province
of
konia
called
forth
an
urgent
claim
for
reparation
which
i
am
pleased
to
say
was
promptly
heeded
by
the
government
of
the
porte
interference
with
the
trading
ventures
of
our
citizens
in
asia
minor
is
also
reported
and
the
lack
of
consular
representation
in
that
region
is
a
serious
drawback
to
instant
and
effective
protection
i
can
not
believe
that
these
incidents
represent
a
settled
policy
and
shall
not
cease
to
urge
the
adoption
of
proper
remedies
international
copyright
has
been
extended
to
italy
by
proclamation
in
conformity
with
the
act
of
march
upon
assurance
being
given
that
italian
law
permits
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
benefit
of
copyright
on
substantially
the
same
basis
as
to
subjects
of
italy
by
a
special
convention
proclaimed
january
reciprocal
provisions
of
copyright
have
been
applied
between
the
united
states
and
germany
negotiations
are
in
progress
with
other
countries
to
the
same
end
i
repeat
with
great
earnestness
the
recommendation
which
i
have
made
in
several
previous
messages
that
prompt
and
adequate
support
be
given
to
the
american
company
engaged
in
the
construction
of
the
nicaragua
ship
canal
it
is
impossible
to
overstate
the
value
from
every
standpoint
of
this
great
enterprise
and
i
hope
that
there
may
be
time
even
in
this
congress
to
give
to
it
an
impetus
that
will
insure
the
early
completion
of
the
canal
and
secure
to
the
united
states
its
proper
relation
to
it
when
completed
the
congress
has
been
already
advised
that
the
invitations
of
this
government
for
the
assembling
of
an
international
monetary
conference
to
consider
the
question
of
an
enlarged
use
of
silver
were
accepted
by
the
nations
to
which
they
were
addressed
the
conference
assembled
at
brussels
on
the
d
of
november
and
has
entered
upon
the
consideration
of
this
great
question
i
have
not
doubted
and
have
taken
occasion
to
express
that
belief
as
well
in
the
invitations
issued
for
this
conference
as
in
my
public
messages
that
the
free
coinage
of
silver
upon
an
agreed
international
ratio
would
greatly
promote
the
interests
of
our
people
and
equally
those
of
other
nations
it
is
too
early
to
predict
what
results
may
be
accomplished
by
the
conference
if
any
temporary
check
or
delay
intervenes
i
believe
that
very
soon
commercial
conditions
will
compel
the
now
reluctant
governments
to
unite
with
us
in
this
movement
to
secure
the
enlargement
of
the
volume
of
coined
money
needed
for
the
transaction
of
the
business
of
the
world
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
will
attract
especial
interest
in
view
of
the
many
misleading
statements
that
have
been
made
as
to
the
state
of
the
public
revenues
three
preliminary
facts
should
not
only
be
stated
but
emphasized
before
looking
into
details
first
that
the
public
debt
has
been
reduced
since
march
and
the
annual
interest
charge
second
that
there
have
been
paid
out
for
pensions
during
this
administration
up
to
november
an
excess
of
over
the
sum
expended
during
the
period
from
march
to
march
and
third
that
under
the
existing
tariff
up
to
december
about
of
revenue
which
would
have
been
collected
upon
imported
sugars
if
the
duty
had
been
maintained
has
gone
into
the
pockets
of
the
people
and
not
into
the
public
treasury
as
before
if
there
are
any
who
still
think
that
the
surplus
should
have
been
kept
out
of
circulation
by
hoarding
it
in
the
treasury
or
deposited
in
favored
banks
without
interest
while
the
government
continued
to
pay
to
these
very
banks
interest
upon
the
bonds
deposited
as
security
for
the
deposits
or
who
think
that
the
extended
pension
legislation
was
a
public
robbery
or
that
the
duties
upon
sugar
should
have
been
maintained
i
am
content
to
leave
the
argument
where
it
now
rests
while
we
wait
to
see
whether
these
criticisms
will
take
the
form
of
legislation
the
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
from
all
sources
were
and
the
expenditures
for
all
purposes
were
leaving
a
balance
of
there
were
paid
during
the
year
upon
the
public
debt
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
and
the
bank
redemption
fund
passed
by
the
act
of
july
to
the
general
fund
furnished
in
large
part
the
cash
available
and
used
for
the
payments
made
upon
the
public
debt
compared
with
the
year
our
receipts
from
customs
duties
fell
off
while
our
receipts
from
internal
revenue
increased
leaving
the
net
loss
of
revenue
from
these
principal
sources
the
net
loss
of
revenue
from
all
sources
was
the
revenues
estimated
and
actual
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
placed
by
the
secretary
at
and
the
expenditures
at
showing
a
surplus
of
receipts
over
expenditures
of
the
cash
balance
in
the
treasury
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
it
is
estimated
will
be
so
far
as
these
figures
are
based
upon
estimates
of
receipts
and
expenditures
for
the
remaining
months
of
the
current
fiscal
year
there
are
not
only
the
usual
elements
of
uncertainty
but
some
added
elements
new
revenue
legislation
or
even
the
expectation
of
it
may
seriously
reduce
the
public
revenues
during
the
period
of
uncertainty
and
during
the
process
of
business
adjustment
to
the
new
conditions
when
they
become
known
but
the
secretary
has
very
wisely
refrained
from
guessing
as
to
the
effect
of
possible
changes
in
our
revenue
laws
since
the
scope
of
those
changes
and
the
time
of
their
taking
effect
can
not
in
any
degree
be
forecast
or
foretold
by
him
his
estimates
must
be
based
upon
existing
laws
and
upon
a
continuance
of
existing
business
conditions
except
so
far
as
these
conditions
may
be
affected
by
causes
other
than
new
legislation
the
estimated
receipts
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
and
the
estimated
appropriations
leaving
an
estimated
surplus
of
receipts
over
expenditures
of
this
does
not
include
any
payment
to
the
sinking
fund
in
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
that
the
sinkingfund
law
be
repealed
i
concur
the
redemption
of
bonds
since
the
passage
of
the
law
to
june
has
already
exceeded
the
requirements
by
the
sum
of
the
retirement
of
bonds
in
the
future
before
maturity
should
be
a
matter
of
convenience
not
of
compulsion
we
should
not
collect
revenue
for
that
purpose
but
only
use
any
casual
surplus
to
the
balance
of
of
receipts
over
expenditures
for
the
year
should
be
added
the
estimated
surplus
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
from
this
aggregate
there
must
be
deducted
as
stated
by
the
secretary
about
of
estimated
unexpended
appropriations
the
public
confidence
in
the
purpose
and
ability
of
the
government
to
maintain
the
parity
of
all
of
our
money
issues
whether
coin
or
paper
must
remain
unshaken
the
demand
for
gold
in
europe
and
the
consequent
calls
upon
us
are
in
a
considerable
degree
the
result
of
the
efforts
of
some
of
the
european
governments
to
increase
their
gold
reserves
and
these
efforts
should
be
met
by
appropriate
legislation
on
our
part
the
conditions
that
have
created
this
drain
of
the
treasury
gold
are
in
an
important
degree
political
and
not
commercial
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
general
revision
of
our
revenue
laws
in
the
near
future
seems
to
be
probable
it
would
be
better
that
any
changes
should
be
a
part
of
that
revision
rather
than
of
a
temporary
nature
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
secretary
purchased
under
the
act
of
july
ounces
of
silver
and
issued
in
payment
therefor
in
notes
the
total
purchases
since
the
passage
of
the
act
have
been
ounces
and
the
aggregate
of
notes
issued
the
average
price
paid
for
silver
during
the
year
was
cents
per
ounce
the
highest
price
being
july
and
the
lowest
cents
march
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
monetary
conference
is
now
sitting
and
that
no
conclusion
has
yet
been
reached
i
withhold
any
recommendation
as
to
legislation
upon
this
subject
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
brings
again
to
the
attention
of
congress
some
important
suggestions
as
to
the
reorganization
of
the
infantry
and
artillery
arms
of
the
service
which
his
predecessors
have
before
urgently
presented
our
army
is
small
but
its
organization
should
all
the
more
be
put
upon
the
most
approved
modern
basis
the
conditions
upon
what
we
have
called
the
frontier
have
heretofore
required
the
maintenance
of
many
small
posts
but
now
the
policy
of
concentration
is
obviously
the
right
one
the
new
posts
should
have
the
proper
strategic
relations
to
the
only
frontiers
we
now
havethose
of
the
seacoast
and
of
our
northern
and
part
of
our
southern
boundary
i
do
not
think
that
any
question
of
advantage
to
localities
or
to
states
should
determine
the
location
of
the
new
posts
the
reorganization
and
enlargement
of
the
bureau
of
military
information
which
the
secretary
has
effected
is
a
work
the
usefulness
of
which
will
become
every
year
more
apparent
the
work
of
building
heavy
guns
and
the
construction
of
coast
defenses
has
been
well
begun
and
should
be
carried
on
without
check
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
is
by
law
submitted
directly
to
congress
but
i
can
not
refrain
from
saying
that
he
has
conducted
the
increasing
work
of
the
department
of
justice
with
great
professional
skill
he
has
in
several
directions
secured
from
the
courts
decisions
g
iving
increased
protection
to
the
officers
of
the
united
states
and
bringing
some
classes
of
crime
that
escaped
local
cognizance
and
punishment
into
the
tribunals
of
the
united
states
where
they
could
be
tried
with
impartiality
the
numerous
applications
for
executive
clemency
presented
in
behalf
of
persons
convicted
in
united
states
courts
and
given
penitentiary
sentences
have
called
my
attention
to
a
fact
referred
to
by
the
attorneygeneral
in
his
report
namely
that
a
time
allowance
for
good
behavior
for
such
prisoners
is
prescribed
by
the
federal
statutes
only
where
the
state
in
which
the
penitentiary
is
located
has
made
no
such
provision
prisoners
are
given
the
benefit
of
the
provisions
of
the
state
law
regulating
the
penitentiary
to
which
they
may
be
sent
these
are
various
some
perhaps
too
liberal
and
some
perhaps
too
illiberal
the
result
is
that
a
sentence
for
five
years
means
one
thing
if
the
prisoner
is
sent
to
one
state
for
confinement
and
quite
a
different
thing
if
he
is
sent
to
another
i
recommend
that
a
uniform
credit
for
good
behavior
be
prescribed
by
congress
i
have
before
expressed
my
concurrence
in
the
recommendation
of
the
attorneygeneral
that
degrees
of
murder
should
be
recognized
in
the
federal
statutes
as
they
are
i
believe
in
all
the
states
these
grades
are
rounded
on
correct
distinctions
in
crime
the
recognition
of
them
would
enable
the
courts
to
exercise
some
discretion
in
apportioning
punishment
and
would
greatly
relieve
the
executive
of
what
is
coming
to
be
a
very
heavy
burdenthe
examination
of
these
cases
on
application
for
commutation
the
aggregate
of
claims
pending
against
the
government
in
the
court
of
claims
is
enormous
claims
to
the
amount
of
nearly
for
the
taking
of
or
injury
to
the
property
of
persons
claiming
to
be
loyal
during
the
war
are
now
before
that
court
for
examination
when
to
these
are
added
the
indian
depredation
claims
and
the
french
spoliation
claims
an
aggregate
is
reached
that
is
indeed
startling
in
the
defense
of
all
these
cases
the
government
is
at
great
disadvantage
the
claimants
have
preserved
their
evidence
whereas
the
agents
of
the
government
are
sent
into
the
field
to
rummage
for
what
they
can
find
this
difficulty
is
peculiarly
great
where
the
fact
to
be
established
is
the
disloyalty
of
the
claimant
during
the
war
if
this
great
threat
against
our
revenues
is
to
have
no
other
check
certainly
congress
should
supply
the
department
of
justice
with
appropriations
sufficiently
liberal
to
secure
the
best
legal
talent
in
the
defense
of
these
claims
and
to
pursue
its
vague
search
for
evidence
effectively
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
shows
a
most
gratifying
increase
and
a
most
efficient
and
progressive
management
of
the
great
business
of
that
department
the
remarkable
increase
in
revenues
in
the
number
of
postoffices
and
in
the
miles
of
mail
carriage
furnishes
further
evidence
of
the
high
state
of
prosperity
which
our
people
are
enjoying
new
offices
mean
new
hamlets
and
towns
new
routes
mean
the
extension
of
our
border
settlements
and
increased
revenues
mean
an
active
commerce
the
postmastergeneral
reviews
the
whole
period
of
his
administration
of
the
office
and
brings
some
of
his
statistics
down
to
the
month
of
november
last
the
postal
revenues
have
increased
during
the
last
year
nearly
the
deficit
for
the
year
ending
june
is
less
than
the
deficiency
of
the
preceding
year
the
deficiency
of
the
present
fiscal
year
it
is
estimated
will
be
reduced
to
which
will
not
only
be
extinguished
during
the
next
fiscal
year
but
a
surplus
of
nearly
should
then
be
shown
in
these
calculations
the
payments
to
be
made
under
the
contracts
for
ocean
mail
service
have
not
been
included
there
have
been
added
new
mail
routes
during
the
year
with
a
mileage
of
miles
and
the
total
number
of
new
miles
of
mail
trips
added
during
the
year
is
nearly
the
number
of
miles
of
mail
journeys
added
during
the
last
four
years
is
about
this
addition
being
miles
more
than
were
in
operation
in
the
whole
country
in
the
number
of
postoffices
has
been
increased
by
during
the
year
and
during
the
past
four
years
and
up
to
october
last
the
total
increase
in
the
number
of
offices
has
been
nearly
the
number
of
freedelivery
offices
has
been
nearly
doubled
in
the
last
four
years
and
the
number
of
moneyorder
offices
more
than
doubled
within
that
time
for
the
three
years
ending
june
the
postal
revenue
amounted
to
which
was
an
increase
of
over
the
revenue
for
the
three
years
ending
june
the
increase
during
the
last
three
years
being
more
than
three
and
a
half
times
as
great
as
the
increase
during
the
three
years
ending
june
no
such
increase
as
that
shown
for
these
three
years
has
ever
previously
appeared
in
the
revenues
of
the
department
the
postmastergeneral
has
extended
to
the
postoffices
in
the
larger
cities
the
merit
system
of
promotion
introduced
by
my
direction
into
the
departments
here
and
it
has
resulted
there
as
in
the
departments
in
a
larger
volume
of
work
and
that
better
done
ever
since
our
merchant
marine
was
driven
from
the
sea
by
the
rebel
cruisers
during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
the
united
states
has
been
paying
an
enormous
annual
tribute
to
foreign
countries
in
the
shape
of
freight
and
passage
moneys
our
grain
and
meats
have
been
taken
at
our
own
docks
and
our
large
imports
there
laid
down
by
foreign
shipmasters
an
increasing
torrent
of
american
travel
to
europe
has
contributed
a
vast
sum
annually
to
the
dividends
of
foreign
shipowners
the
balance
of
trade
shown
by
the
books
of
our
customhouses
has
been
very
largely
reduced
and
in
many
years
altogether
extinguished
by
this
constant
drain
in
the
year
only
per
cent
of
our
imports
were
brought
in
american
vessels
these
great
foreign
steamships
maintained
by
our
traffic
are
many
of
them
under
contracts
with
their
respective
governments
by
which
in
time
of
war
they
will
become
a
part
of
their
armed
naval
establishments
profiting
by
our
commerce
in
peace
they
will
become
the
most
formidable
destroyers
of
our
commerce
in
time
of
war
i
have
felt
and
have
before
expressed
the
feeling
that
this
condition
of
things
was
both
intolerable
and
disgraceful
a
wholesome
change
of
policy
and
one
having
in
it
much
promise
as
it
seems
to
me
was
begun
by
the
law
of
march
under
this
law
contracts
have
been
made
by
the
postmastergeneral
for
eleven
mail
routes
the
expenditure
involved
by
these
contracts
for
the
next
fiscal
year
approximates
as
one
of
the
results
already
reached
sixteen
american
steamships
of
an
aggregate
tonnage
of
tons
costing
have
been
built
or
contracted
to
be
built
in
american
shipyards
the
estimated
tonnage
of
all
steamships
required
under
existing
contracts
is
and
when
the
full
service
required
by
these
contracts
is
established
there
will
be
fortyone
mail
steamers
under
the
american
flag
with
the
probability
of
further
necessary
additions
in
the
brazilian
and
argentine
service
the
contracts
recently
let
for
transatlantic
service
will
result
in
the
construction
of
five
ships
of
tons
each
costing
to
and
will
add
with
the
city
of
new
york
and
city
of
paris
to
which
the
treasury
department
was
authorized
by
legislation
at
the
last
session
to
give
american
registry
seven
of
the
swiftest
vessels
upon
the
sea
to
our
naval
reserve
the
contracts
made
with
the
lines
sailing
to
central
and
south
american
ports
have
increased
the
frequency
and
shortened
the
time
of
the
trips
added
new
ports
of
call
and
sustained
some
lines
that
otherwise
would
almost
certainly
have
been
withdrawn
the
service
to
buenos
ayres
is
the
first
to
the
argentine
republic
under
the
american
flag
the
service
to
southampton
boulogne
and
antwerp
is
also
new
and
is
to
be
begun
with
the
steamships
city
of
new
york
and
city
of
paris
in
february
next
i
earnestly
urge
the
continuance
of
the
policy
inaugurated
by
this
legislation
and
that
the
appropriations
required
to
meet
the
obligations
of
the
government
under
the
contracts
may
be
made
promptly
so
that
the
lines
that
have
entered
into
these
engagements
may
not
be
embarrassed
we
have
had
by
reason
of
connections
with
the
transcontinental
railway
lines
constructed
through
our
own
territory
some
advantages
in
the
ocean
trade
of
the
pacific
that
we
did
not
possess
on
the
atlantic
the
construction
of
the
canadian
pacific
railway
and
the
establishment
under
large
subventions
from
canada
and
england
of
fast
steamship
service
from
vancouver
with
japan
and
china
seriously
threaten
our
shipping
interests
in
the
pacific
this
line
of
english
steamers
receives
as
is
stated
by
the
commissioner
of
navigation
a
direct
subsidy
of
annually
or
per
trip
for
thirteen
voyages
in
addition
to
some
further
aid
from
the
admiralty
in
connection
with
contracts
under
which
the
vessels
may
be
used
for
naval
purposes
the
competing
american
pacific
mail
line
under
the
act
of
march
receives
only
per
round
trip
efforts
have
been
making
within
the
last
year
as
i
am
informed
to
establish
under
similar
conditions
a
line
between
vancouver
and
some
australian
port
with
a
view
of
seizing
there
a
trade
in
which
we
have
had
a
large
interest
the
commissioner
of
navigation
states
that
a
very
large
per
cent
of
our
imports
from
asia
are
now
brought
to
us
by
english
steamships
and
their
connecting
railways
in
canada
with
a
view
of
promoting
this
trade
especially
in
tea
canada
has
imposed
a
discriminating
duty
of
per
cent
upon
tea
and
coffee
brought
into
the
dominion
from
the
united
states
if
this
unequal
contest
between
american
lines
without
subsidy
or
with
diminished
subsidies
and
the
english
canadian
line
to
which
i
have
referred
is
to
continue
i
think
we
should
at
least
see
that
the
facilities
for
customs
entry
and
transportation
across
our
territory
are
not
such
as
to
make
the
canadian
route
a
favored
one
and
that
the
discrimination
as
to
duties
to
which
i
have
referred
is
met
by
a
like
discrimination
as
to
the
importation
of
these
articles
from
canada
no
subject
i
think
more
nearly
touches
the
pride
the
power
and
the
prosperity
of
our
country
than
this
of
the
development
of
our
merc
hant
marine
upon
the
sea
if
we
could
enter
into
conference
with
other
competitors
and
all
would
agree
to
withhold
government
aid
we
could
perhaps
take
our
chances
with
the
rest
but
our
great
competitors
have
established
and
maintained
their
lines
by
government
subsidies
until
they
now
have
practically
excluded
us
from
participation
in
my
opinion
no
choice
is
left
to
us
but
to
pursue
moderately
at
least
the
same
lines
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
exhibits
great
progress
in
the
construction
of
our
new
navy
when
the
present
secretary
entered
upon
his
duties
only
modern
steel
vessels
were
in
commission
the
vessels
since
put
in
commission
and
to
be
put
in
commission
during
the
winter
will
make
a
total
of
during
his
administration
of
the
department
during
the
current
year
war
vessels
and
navy
tugs
have
been
launched
and
during
the
four
years
vessels
will
have
been
launched
two
other
large
ships
and
a
torpedo
boat
are
under
contract
and
the
work
upon
them
well
advanced
and
the
monitors
are
awaiting
only
the
arrival
of
their
armor
which
has
been
unexpectedly
delayed
or
they
would
have
been
before
this
in
commission
contracts
have
been
let
during
this
administration
under
the
appropriations
for
the
increase
of
the
navy
including
new
vessels
and
their
appurtenances
to
the
amount
of
and
there
has
been
expended
during
the
same
period
for
labor
at
navyyards
upon
similar
work
without
the
smallest
scandal
or
charge
of
fraud
or
partiality
the
enthusiasm
and
interest
of
our
naval
officers
both
of
the
staff
and
line
have
been
greatly
kindled
they
have
responded
magnificently
to
the
confidence
of
congress
and
have
demonstrated
to
the
world
an
unexcelled
capacity
in
construction
in
ordnance
and
in
everything
involved
in
the
building
equipping
and
sailing
of
great
war
ships
at
the
beginning
of
secretary
tracys
administration
several
difficult
problems
remained
to
be
grappled
with
and
solved
before
the
efficiency
in
action
of
our
ships
could
be
secured
it
is
believed
that
as
the
result
of
new
processes
in
the
construction
of
armor
plate
our
later
ships
will
be
clothed
with
defensive
plates
of
higher
resisting
power
than
are
found
on
any
war
vessels
afloat
we
were
without
torpedoes
tests
have
been
made
to
ascertain
the
relative
efficiency
of
different
constructions
a
torpedo
has
been
adopted
and
the
work
of
construction
is
now
being
carried
on
successfully
we
were
without
armorpiercing
shells
and
without
a
shop
instructed
and
equipped
for
the
construction
of
them
we
are
now
making
what
is
believed
to
be
a
projectile
superior
to
any
before
in
use
a
smokeless
powder
has
been
developed
and
a
slowburning
powder
for
guns
of
large
caliber
a
high
explosive
capable
of
use
in
shells
fired
from
service
guns
has
been
found
and
the
manufacture
of
gun
cotton
has
been
developed
so
that
the
question
of
supply
is
no
longer
in
doubt
the
development
of
a
naval
militia
which
has
been
organized
in
eight
states
and
brought
into
cordial
and
cooperative
relations
with
the
navy
is
another
important
achievement
there
are
now
enlisted
in
these
organizations
men
and
they
are
likely
to
be
greatly
extended
i
recommend
such
legislation
and
appropriations
as
will
encourage
and
develop
this
movement
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
will
i
do
not
doubt
receive
the
friendly
consideration
of
congress
for
he
has
enjoyed
as
he
has
deserved
the
confidence
of
all
those
interested
in
the
development
of
our
navy
without
any
division
upon
partisan
lines
i
earnestly
express
the
hope
that
a
work
which
has
made
such
noble
progress
may
not
now
be
stayed
the
wholesome
influence
for
peace
and
the
increased
sense
of
security
which
our
citizens
domiciled
in
other
lands
feel
when
these
magnificent
ships
under
the
american
flag
appear
is
already
most
gratefully
apparent
the
ships
from
our
navy
which
will
appear
in
the
great
naval
parade
next
april
in
the
harbor
of
new
york
will
be
a
convincing
demonstration
to
the
world
that
the
united
states
is
again
a
naval
power
the
work
of
the
interior
department
always
very
burdensome
has
been
larger
than
ever
before
during
the
administration
of
secretary
noble
the
disabilitypension
law
the
taking
of
the
eleventh
census
the
opening
of
vast
areas
of
indian
lands
to
settlement
the
organization
of
oklahoma
and
the
negotiations
for
the
cession
of
indian
lands
furnish
some
of
the
particulars
of
the
increased
work
and
the
results
achieved
testify
to
the
ability
fidelity
and
industry
of
the
head
of
the
department
and
his
efficient
assistants
several
important
agreements
for
the
cession
of
indian
lands
negotiated
by
the
commission
appointed
under
the
act
of
march
are
awaiting
the
action
of
congress
perhaps
the
most
important
of
these
is
that
for
the
cession
of
the
cherokee
strip
this
region
has
been
the
source
of
great
vexation
to
the
executive
department
and
of
great
friction
and
unrest
between
the
settlers
who
desire
to
occupy
it
and
the
indians
who
assert
title
the
agreement
which
has
been
made
by
the
commission
is
perhaps
the
most
satisfactory
that
could
have
been
reached
it
will
be
noticed
that
it
is
conditioned
upon
its
ratification
by
congress
before
march
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who
has
given
the
subject
very
careful
thought
recommends
the
ratification
of
the
agreement
and
i
am
inclined
to
follow
his
recommendation
certain
it
is
that
some
action
by
which
this
controversy
shall
be
brought
to
an
end
and
these
lands
opened
to
settlement
is
urgent
the
form
of
government
provided
by
congress
on
may
for
alaska
was
in
its
frame
and
purpose
temporary
the
increase
of
population
and
the
development
of
some
important
mining
and
commercial
interests
make
it
imperative
that
the
law
should
be
revised
and
better
provision
made
for
the
arrest
and
punishment
of
criminals
the
report
of
the
secretary
shows
a
very
gratifying
state
of
facts
as
to
the
condition
of
the
general
land
office
the
work
of
issuing
agricultural
patents
which
seemed
to
be
hopelessly
in
arrear
when
the
present
secretary
undertook
the
duties
of
his
office
has
been
so
expedited
that
the
bureau
is
now
upon
current
business
the
relief
thus
afforded
to
honest
and
worthy
settlers
upon
the
public
lands
by
giving
to
them
an
assured
title
to
their
entries
has
been
of
incalculable
benefit
in
developing
the
new
states
and
the
territories
the
court
of
private
land
claims
established
by
congress
for
the
promotion
of
this
policy
of
speedily
settling
contested
land
titles
is
making
satisfactory
progress
in
its
work
and
when
the
work
is
completed
a
great
impetus
will
be
given
to
the
development
of
those
regions
where
unsettled
claims
under
mexican
grants
have
so
long
exercised
their
repressive
influence
when
to
these
results
are
added
the
enormous
cessions
of
indian
lands
which
have
been
opened
to
settlement
aggregating
during
this
administration
nearly
acres
and
the
agreements
negotiated
and
now
pending
in
congress
for
ratification
by
which
about
additional
acres
will
be
opened
to
settlement
it
will
be
seen
how
much
has
been
accomplished
the
work
in
the
indian
bureau
in
the
execution
of
the
policy
of
recent
legislation
has
been
largely
directed
to
two
chief
purposes
first
the
allotment
of
lands
in
severalty
to
the
indians
and
the
cession
to
the
united
states
of
the
surplus
lands
and
secondly
to
the
work
of
educating
the
indian
for
his
own
protection
in
his
closer
contact
with
the
white
man
and
for
the
intelligent
exercise
of
his
new
citizenship
allotments
have
been
made
and
patents
issued
to
indians
under
the
present
secretary
and
commissioner
and
additional
allotments
have
been
made
for
which
patents
are
now
in
process
of
preparation
the
school
attendance
of
indian
children
has
been
increased
during
that
time
over
per
cent
the
enrollment
for
being
nearly
a
uniform
system
of
school
textbooks
and
of
study
has
been
adopted
and
the
work
in
these
national
schools
brought
as
near
as
may
be
to
the
basis
of
the
free
common
schools
of
the
states
these
schools
can
be
transferred
and
merged
into
the
commonschool
systems
of
the
states
when
the
indian
has
fully
assumed
his
new
relation
to
the
organized
civil
community
in
which
he
resides
and
the
new
states
are
able
to
assume
the
burden
i
have
several
times
been
called
upon
to
remove
indian
agents
appointed
by
me
and
have
done
so
promptly
upon
every
sustained
complaint
of
unfitness
or
misconduct
i
believe
however
that
the
indian
service
at
the
agencies
has
been
improved
and
is
now
administered
on
the
whole
with
a
good
degree
of
efficiency
if
any
legislation
is
possible
by
which
the
selection
of
indian
agents
can
be
wholly
removed
from
all
partisan
suggestions
or
considerations
i
am
sure
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
the
executive
and
a
great
benefit
to
the
service
the
appropriation
for
the
subsistence
of
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
indians
made
at
the
last
session
of
congress
was
inadequate
this
smaller
appropriation
was
estimated
for
by
the
commissioner
upon
the
theory
that
the
large
fund
belonging
to
the
tribe
in
the
public
treasury
could
be
and
ought
to
be
used
for
their
support
in
view
however
of
the
pending
depredation
claims
against
this
fund
and
other
considerations
the
secretary
of
the
interior
on
the
th
of
april
last
submitted
a
supplemental
estimate
for
this
appropriation
was
not
made
as
it
should
have
been
and
the
oversight
ought
to
be
remedied
at
the
earliest
possible
date
in
a
special
message
to
this
congress
at
the
last
session
i
stated
the
reasons
why
i
had
not
approved
the
deed
for
the
release
to
the
united
states
by
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
of
the
lands
formerly
embraced
in
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
reservation
and
remaining
after
allotments
to
that
tribe
a
resolution
of
the
senate
expressing
the
opinion
of
that
body
that
notwithstanding
the
facts
stated
in
my
special
message
the
deed
should
be
approved
and
the
money
paid
over
was
presented
to
me
may
my
special
message
was
intended
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
conceded
that
the
appropriation
proceeded
upon
a
false
basis
as
to

the
amount
of
lands
to
be
paid
for
and
is
by
in
excess
of
the
amount
they
are
entitled
to
even
if
their
claim
to
the
land
is
given
full
recognition
at
the
rate
agreed
upon
i
have
not
felt
willing
to
approve
the
deed
and
shall
not
do
so
at
least
until
both
houses
of
congress
have
acted
upon
the
subject
it
has
been
informally
proposed
by
the
claimants
to
release
this
sum
of
but
i
have
no
power
to
demand
or
accept
such
a
release
and
such
an
agreement
would
be
without
consideration
and
void
i
desire
further
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
fact
that
the
recent
agreement
concluded
with
the
kiowas
and
comanches
relates
to
lands
which
were
a
part
of
the
leased
district
and
to
which
the
claim
of
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
is
precisely
that
recognized
by
congress
in
the
legislation
i
have
referred
to
the
surplus
lands
to
which
this
claim
would
attach
in
the
kiowa
and
comanche
reservation
is
acres
and
at
the
same
rate
the
government
will
be
called
upon
to
pay
to
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
for
these
lands
this
sum
will
be
further
augmented
especially
if
the
title
of
the
indians
to
the
tract
now
greet
county
tex
is
established
the
duty
devolved
upon
me
in
this
connection
was
simply
to
pass
upon
the
form
of
the
deed
but
as
in
my
opinion
the
facts
mentioned
in
my
special
message
were
not
adequately
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
in
connection
with
the
legislation
i
have
felt
that
i
would
not
be
justified
in
acting
without
some
new
expression
of
the
legislative
will
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
pensions
to
which
extended
notice
is
given
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
his
report
will
attract
great
attention
judged
by
the
aggregate
amount
of
work
done
the
last
year
has
been
the
greatest
in
the
history
of
the
office
i
believe
that
the
organization
of
the
office
is
efficient
and
that
the
work
has
been
done
with
fidelity
the
passage
of
what
is
known
as
the
disability
bill
has
as
was
foreseen
very
largely
increased
the
annual
disbursements
to
the
disabled
veterans
of
the
civil
war
the
estimate
for
this
fiscal
year
was
and
that
amount
was
appropriated
a
deficiency
amounting
to
must
be
provided
for
at
this
session
the
estimate
for
pensions
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
is
the
commissioner
of
pensions
believes
that
if
the
present
legislation
and
methods
are
maintained
and
further
additions
to
the
pension
laws
are
not
made
the
maximum
expenditure
for
pensions
will
be
reached
june
and
will
be
at
the
highest
point
per
annum
i
adhere
to
the
views
expressed
in
previous
messages
that
the
care
of
the
disabled
soldiers
of
the
war
of
the
rebellion
is
a
matter
of
national
concern
and
duty
perhaps
no
emotion
cools
sooner
than
that
of
gratitude
but
i
can
not
believe
that
this
process
has
yet
reached
a
point
with
our
people
that
would
sustain
the
policy
of
remitting
the
care
of
these
disabled
veterans
to
the
inadequate
agencies
provided
by
local
laws
the
parade
on
the
th
of
september
last
upon
the
streets
of
this
capital
of
of
the
surviving
union
veterans
of
the
war
of
the
rebellion
was
a
most
touching
and
thrilling
episode
and
the
rich
and
gracious
welcome
extended
to
them
by
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
applause
that
greeted
their
progress
from
tens
of
thousands
of
people
from
all
the
states
did
much
to
revive
the
glorious
recollections
of
the
grand
review
when
these
men
and
many
thousand
others
now
in
their
graves
were
welcomed
with
grateful
joy
as
victors
in
a
struggle
in
which
the
national
unity
honor
and
wealth
were
all
at
issue
in
my
last
annual
message
i
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
some
legislative
action
was
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
government
in
its
relations
with
the
union
pacific
railway
the
commissioner
of
railroads
has
submitted
a
very
full
report
giving
exact
information
as
to
the
debt
the
liens
upon
the
companys
property
and
its
resources
we
must
deal
with
the
question
as
we
find
it
and
take
that
course
which
will
under
existing
conditions
best
secure
the
interests
of
the
united
states
i
recommended
in
my
last
annual
message
that
a
commission
be
appointed
to
deal
with
this
question
and
i
renew
that
recommendation
and
suggest
that
the
commission
be
given
full
power
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
contains
not
only
a
most
interesting
statement
of
the
progressive
and
valuable
work
done
under
the
administration
of
secretary
rusk
but
many
suggestions
for
the
enlarged
usefulness
of
this
important
department
in
the
successful
efforts
to
break
down
the
restrictions
to
the
free
introduction
of
our
meat
products
in
the
countries
of
europe
the
secretary
has
been
untiring
from
the
first
stimulating
and
aiding
all
other
government
officers
at
home
and
abroad
whose
official
duties
enabled
them
to
participate
in
the
work
the
total
trade
in
hog
products
with
europe
in
may
amounted
to
pounds
against
in
the
same
month
of
in
june
the
export
aggregated
pounds
against
pounds
in
the
same
month
of
the
previous
year
in
july
there
was
an
increase
of
per
cent
and
in
august
of
per
cent
over
the
corresponding
months
of
over
pounds
of
inspected
pork
have
been
exported
since
the
law
was
put
into
operation
and
a
comparison
of
the
four
months
of
may
june
july
and
august
with
the
same
months
of
shows
an
increase
in
the
number
of
pounds
of
our
export
of
pork
products
of
per
cent
and
an
increase
in
value
of
per
cent
the
exports
of
dressed
beef
increased
from
pounds
in
to
pounds
in
or
about
per
cent
during
the
past
year
there
have
been
exported
head
of
live
cattle
as
against
exported
in
this
increased
exportation
has
been
largely
promoted
by
the
inspection
authorized
by
law
and
the
faithful
efforts
of
the
secretary
and
his
efficient
subordinates
to
make
that
inspection
thorough
and
to
carefully
exclude
from
all
cargoes
diseased
or
suspected
cattle
the
requirement
of
the
english
regulations
that
live
cattle
arriving
from
the
united
states
must
be
slaughtered
at
the
docks
had
its
origin
in
the
claim
that
pleuropneumonia
existed
among
american
cattle
and
that
the
existence
of
the
disease
could
only
certainly
be
determined
by
a
post
mortem
inspection
the
department
of
agriculture
has
labored
with
great
energy
and
faithfulness
to
extirpate
this
disease
and
on
the
th
day
of
september
last
a
public
announcement
was
made
by
the
secretary
that
the
disease
no
longer
existed
anywhere
within
the
united
states
he
is
entirely
satisfied
after
the
most
searching
inquiry
that
this
statement
was
justified
and
that
by
a
continuance
of
the
inspection
and
quarantine
now
required
of
cattle
brought
into
this
country
the
disease
can
be
prevented
from
again
getting
any
foothold
the
value
to
the
cattle
industry
of
the
united
states
of
this
achievement
can
hardly
be
estimated
we
can
not
perhaps
at
once
insist
that
this
evidence
shall
be
accepted
as
satisfactory
by
other
countries
but
if
the
present
exemption
from
the
disease
is
maintained
and
the
inspection
of
our
cattle
arriving
at
foreign
ports
in
which
our
own
veterinarians
participate
confirms
it
we
may
justly
expect
that
the
requirement
that
our
cattle
shall
be
slaughtered
at
the
docks
will
be
revoked
as
the
sanitary
restrictions
upon
our
pork
products
have
been
if
our
cattle
can
be
taken
alive
to
the
interior
the
trade
will
be
enormously
increased
agricultural
products
constituted
per
cent
of
our
unprecedented
exports
for
the
fiscal
year
which
closed
june
the
total
exports
being
and
the
value
of
the
agricultural
products
which
exceeds
by
more
than
the
shipment
of
agricultural
products
in
any
previous
year
an
interesting
and
a
promising
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
american
farmer
has
been
begun
through
agents
of
the
agricultural
department
in
europe
and
consists
in
efforts
to
introduce
the
various
products
of
indian
corn
as
articles
of
human
food
the
high
price
of
rye
offered
a
favorable
opportunity
for
the
experiment
in
germany
of
combining
corn
meal
with
rye
to
produce
a
cheaper
bread
a
fair
degree
of
success
has
been
attained
and
some
mills
for
grinding
corn
for
food
have
been
introduced
the
secretary
is
of
the
opinion
that
this
new
use
of
the
products
of
corn
has
already
stimulated
exportations
and
that
if
diligently
prosecuted
large
and
important
markets
can
presently
be
opened
for
this
great
american
product
the
suggestions
of
the
secretary
for
an
enlargement
of
the
work
of
the
department
are
commended
to
your
favorable
consideration
it
may
i
think
be
said
without
challenge
that
in
no
corresponding
period
has
so
much
been
done
as
during
the
last
four
years
for
the
benefit
of
american
agriculture
the
subject
of
quarantine
regulations
inspection
and
control
was
brought
suddenly
to
my
attention
by
the
arrival
at
our
ports
in
august
last
of
vessels
infected
with
cholera
quarantine
regulations
should
be
uniform
at
all
our
ports
under
the
constitution
they
are
plainly
within
the
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
when
and
so
far
as
congress
shall
legislate
in
my
opinion
the
whole
subject
should
be
taken
into
national
control
and
adequate
power
given
to
the
executive
to
protect
our
people
against
plague
invasions
on
the
st
of
september
last
i
approved
regulations
establishing
a
twentyday
quarantine
for
all
vessels
bringing
immigrants
from
foreign
ports
this
order
will
be
continued
in
force
some
loss
and
suffering
have
resulted
to
passengers
but
a
due
care
for
the
homes
of
our
people
justifies
in
such
cases
the
utmost
precaution
there
is
danger
that
with
the
coming
of
spring
cholera
will
again
appear
and
a
liberal
appropriation
should
be
made
at
this
session
to
enable
our
quarantine
and
port
officers
to
exclude
the
deadly
plague
but
the
most
careful
and
stringent
quarantine
regulations
may
not
be
sufficient
absolutely
to
exclude
the
disease
the
progress
of
medical
and
sanitary
science
has
been
such
however
that
if
approved
precautions
are
taken
at
once
to
put
all
of
our
cities
and
towns
in
the
best
sanitary
condition
and
provision
is
made
for
isolating
any
sporadic
cases
and
for
a
thorough
disinfection
an
epidemic
can
i
am
sure
be
avoided
this
work
appertains
to
the
l
ocal
authorities
and
the
responsibility
and
the
penalty
will
be
appalling
if
it
is
neglected
or
unduly
delayed
we
are
peculiarly
subject
in
our
great
ports
to
the
spread
of
infectious
diseases
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
unrestricted
immigration
brings
to
us
out
of
european
cities
in
the
overcrowded
steerages
of
great
steamships
a
large
number
of
persons
whose
surroundings
make
them
the
easy
victims
of
the
plague
this
consideration
as
well
as
those
affecting
the
political
moral
and
industrial
interests
of
our
country
leads
me
to
renew
the
suggestion
that
admission
to
our
country
and
to
the
high
privileges
of
its
citizenship
should
be
more
restricted
and
more
careful
we
have
i
think
a
right
and
owe
a
duty
to
our
own
people
and
especially
to
our
working
people
not
only
to
keep
out
the
vicious
the
ignorant
the
civil
disturber
the
pauper
and
the
contract
laborer
but
to
check
the
too
great
flow
of
immigration
now
coming
by
further
limitations
the
report
of
the
worlds
columbian
exposition
has
not
yet
been
submitted
that
of
the
board
of
management
of
the
government
exhibit
has
been
received
and
is
herewith
transmitted
the
work
of
construction
and
of
preparation
for
the
opening
of
the
exposition
in
may
next
has
progressed
most
satisfactorily
and
upon
a
scale
of
liberality
and
magnificence
that
will
worthily
sustain
the
honor
of
the
united
states
the
district
of
columbia
is
left
by
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
without
any
law
regulating
the
liquor
traffic
an
old
statute
of
the
legislature
of
the
district
relating
to
the
licensing
of
various
vocations
has
hitherto
been
treated
by
the
commissioners
as
giving
them
power
to
grant
or
refuse
licenses
to
sell
intoxicating
liquors
and
as
subjecting
those
who
sold
without
licenses
to
penalties
but
in
may
last
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
held
against
this
view
of
the
powers
of
the
commissioners
it
is
of
urgent
importance
therefore
that
congress
should
supply
either
by
direct
enactment
or
by
conferring
discretionary
powers
upon
the
commissioners
proper
limitations
and
restraints
upon
the
liquor
traffic
in
the
district
the
district
has
suffered
in
its
reputation
by
many
crimes
of
violence
a
large
per
cent
of
them
resulting
from
drunkenness
and
the
liquor
traffic
the
capital
of
the
nation
should
be
freed
from
this
reproach
by
the
enactment
of
stringent
restrictions
and
limitations
upon
the
traffic
in
renewing
the
recommendation
which
i
have
made
in
three
preceding
annual
messages
that
congress
should
legislate
for
the
protection
of
railroad
employees
against
the
dangers
incident
to
the
old
and
inadequate
methods
of
braking
and
coupling
which
are
still
in
use
upon
freight
trains
i
do
so
with
the
hope
that
this
congress
may
take
action
upon
the
subject
statistics
furnished
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
show
that
during
the
year
ending
june
there
were
fortyseven
different
styles
of
car
couplers
reported
to
be
in
use
and
that
during
the
same
period
there
were
employees
killed
and
injured
nearly
per
cent
of
the
deaths
occurred
in
the
coupling
and
uncoupling
of
cars
and
over
per
cent
of
the
injuries
had
the
same
origin
the
civil
service
commission
ask
for
an
increased
appropriation
for
needed
clerical
assistance
which
i
think
should
be
given
i
extended
the
classified
service
march
to
include
physicians
superintendents
assistant
superintendents
schoolteachers
and
matrons
in
the
indian
service
and
have
had
under
consideration
the
subject
of
some
further
extensions
but
have
not
as
yet
fully
determined
the
lines
upon
which
extensions
can
most
properly
and
usefully
be
made
i
have
in
each
of
the
three
annual
messages
which
it
has
been
my
duty
to
submit
to
congress
called
attention
to
the
evils
and
dangers
connected
with
our
election
methods
and
practices
as
they
are
related
to
the
choice
of
officers
of
the
national
government
in
my
last
annual
message
i
endeavored
to
invoke
serious
attention
to
the
evils
of
unfair
apportionments
for
congress
i
can
not
close
this
message
without
again
calling
attention
to
these
grave
and
threatening
evils
i
had
hoped
that
it
was
possible
to
secure
a
nonpartisan
inquiry
by
means
of
a
commission
into
evils
the
existence
of
which
is
known
to
all
and
that
out
of
this
might
grow
legislation
from
which
all
thought
of
partisan
advantage
should
be
eliminated
and
only
the
higher
thought
appear
of
maintaining
the
freedom
and
purity
of
the
ballot
and
the
equality
of
the
elector
without
the
guaranty
of
which
the
government
could
never
have
been
formed
and
without
the
continuance
of
which
it
can
not
continue
to
exist
in
peace
and
prosperity
it
is
time
that
mutual
charges
of
unfairness
and
fraud
between
the
great
parties
should
cease
and
that
the
sincerity
of
those
who
profess
a
desire
for
pure
and
honest
elections
should
be
brought
to
the
test
of
their
willingness
to
free
our
legislation
and
our
election
methods
from
everything
that
tends
to
impair
the
public
confidence
in
the
announced
result
the
necessity
for
an
inquiry
and
for
legislation
by
congress
upon
this
subject
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
the
tendency
of
the
legislation
in
some
states
in
recent
years
has
in
some
important
particulars
been
away
from
and
not
toward
free
and
fair
elections
and
equal
apportionments
is
it
not
time
that
we
should
come
together
upon
the
high
plane
of
patriotism
while
we
devise
methods
that
shall
secure
the
right
of
every
man
qualified
by
law
to
cast
a
free
ballot
and
give
to
every
such
ballot
an
equal
value
in
choosing
our
public
officers
and
in
directing
the
policy
of
the
government
lawlessness
is
not
less
such
but
more
where
it
usurps
the
functions
of
the
peace
officer
and
of
the
courts
the
frequent
lynching
of
colored
people
accused
of
crime
is
without
the
excuse
which
has
sometimes
been
urged
by
mobs
for
a
failure
to
pursue
the
appointed
methods
for
the
punishment
of
crime
that
the
accused
have
an
undue
influence
over
courts
and
juries
such
acts
are
a
reproach
to
the
community
where
they
occur
and
so
far
as
they
can
be
made
the
subject
of
federal
jurisdiction
the
strongest
repressive
legislation
is
demanded
a
public
sentiment
that
will
sustain
the
officers
of
the
law
in
resisting
mobs
and
in
protecting
accused
persons
in
their
custody
should
be
promoted
by
every
possible
means
the
officer
who
gives
his
life
in
the
brave
discharge
of
this
duty
is
worthy
of
special
honor
no
lesson
needs
to
be
so
urgently
impressed
upon
our
people
as
this
that
no
worthy
end
or
cause
can
be
promoted
by
lawlessness
this
exhibit
of
the
work
of
the
executive
departments
is
submitted
to
congress
and
to
the
public
in
the
hope
that
there
will
be
found
in
it
a
due
sense
of
responsibility
and
an
earnest
purpose
to
maintain
the
national
honor
and
to
promote
the
happiness
and
prosperity
of
all
our
people
and
this
brief
exhibit
of
the
growth
and
prosperity
of
the
country
will
give
us
a
level
from
which
to
note
the
increase
or
decadence
that
new
legislative
policies
may
bring
to
us
there
is
no
reason
why
the
national
influence
power
and
prosperity
should
not
observe
the
same
rates
of
increase
that
have
characterized
the
past
thirty
years
we
carry
the
great
impulse
and
increase
of
these
years
into
the
future
there
is
no
reason
why
in
many
lines
of
production
we
should
not
surpass
all
other
nations
as
we
have
already
done
in
some
there
are
no
near
frontiers
to
our
possible
development
retrogression
would
be
a
crime
benj
harrison

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
reports
of
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
required
by
law
to
be
submitted
to
me
which
are
herewith
transmitted
and
the
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
attorneygeneral
made
directly
to
congress
furnish
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
administrative
work
of
the
last
fiscal
year
relating
to
internal
affair
it
would
be
of
great
advantage
if
these
reports
could
have
an
alternative
perusal
by
every
member
of
congress
and
by
all
who
take
an
interest
in
public
affairs
such
a
perusal
could
not
fail
to
excite
a
higher
appreciation
of
the
vast
labor
and
conscientious
effort
which
are
given
to
the
conduct
of
our
civil
administration
the
reports
will
i
believe
show
that
every
question
has
been
approached
considered
and
decided
from
the
standpoint
of
public
duty
upon
considerations
affecting
the
public
interests
alone
again
i
invite
to
every
branch
of
the
service
the
attention
and
scrutiny
of
congress
the
work
of
the
state
department
during
the
last
year
has
been
characterized
by
an
unusual
number
of
important
negotiations
and
by
diplomatic
results
of
a
notable
and
highly
beneficial
character
among
these
are
the
reciprocal
trade
arrangements
which
have
been
concluded
in
the
exercise
of
the
powers
conferred
by
section
of
the
tariff
law
with
the
republic
of
brazil
with
spain
for
its
west
india
possessions
and
with
santo
domingo
like
negotiations
with
other
countries
have
been
much
advanced
and
it
is
hoped
that
before
the
close
of
the
year
further
definitive
trade
arrangements
of
great
value
will
be
concluded
in
view
of
the
reports
which
had
been
received
as
to
the
diminution
of
the
seal
herds
in
the
bering
sea
i
deemed
it
wise
to
propose
to
her
majestys
government
in
february
last
that
an
agreement
for
a
closed
season
should
be
made
pending
the
negotiations
for
arbitration
which
then
seemed
to
be
approaching
a
favorable
conclusion
after
much
correspondence
and
delays
for
which
this
government
was
not
responsible
an
agreement
was
reached
and
signed
on
the
th
of
june
by
which
great
britain
undertook
from
that
date
and
until
may
to
prohibit
the
killing
by
her
subjects
of
seals
in
the
bering
sea
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
during
the
same
period
to
enforce
its
existing
prohibition
against
pelagic
sealing
and
to
limit
the
catch
by
the
furseal
company
upon
the
islands
to
skins
if
this
agreement
could
have
been
reached
earlier
in
response
to
the
strenuous
endeavors
of
this
government
it
would
have
been
more
effective
but
coming
even
as
late
as
it
did
it
unquestionably
resulted
in
greatly
diminishing
the
destruction
of
the
seals
by
the
canadian
sealers
in
my
last
annual
message
i
stated
that
the
basis
of
arbitration
proposed
by
her
majestys
government
for
the
adjustment
of
the
longpending
controversy
as
to
the
seal
fisheries
was
not
acceptable
i
am
glad
now
to
be
able
to
announce
that
terms
satisfactory
to
this
government
have
been
agreed
upon
and
that
an
agreement
as
to
the
arbitrators
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
the
completion
of
the
convention
in
view
of
the
advanced
position
which
this
government
has
taken
upon
the
subject
of
international
arbitration
this
renewed
expression
of
our
adherence
to
this
method
for
the
settlement
of
disputes
such
as
have
arisen
in
the
bering
sea
will
i
doubt
not
meet
with
the
concurrence
of
congress
provision
should
be
made
for
a
joint
demarcation
of
the
frontier
line
between
canada
and
the
united
states
wherever
required
by
the
increasing
border
settlements
and
especially
for
the
exact
location
of
the
water
boundary
in
the
straits
and
rivers
i
should
have
been
glad
to
announce
some
favorable
disposition
of
the
boundary
dispute
between
great
britain
and
venezuela
touching
the
western
frontier
of
british
guiana
but
the
friendly
efforts
of
the
united
states
in
that
direction
have
thus
far
been
unavailing
this
government
will
continue
to
express
its
concern
at
any
appearance
of
foreign
encroachment
on
territories
long
under
the
administrative
control
of
american
states
the
determination
of
a
disputed
boundary
is
easily
attainable
by
amicable
arbitration
where
the
rights
of
the
respective
parties
rest
as
here
on
historic
facts
readily
ascertainable
the
law
of
the
last
congress
providing
a
system
of
inspection
for
our
meats
intended
for
export
and
clothing
the
president
with
power
to
exclude
foreign
products
from
our
market
in
case
the
country
sending
them
should
perpetuate
unjust
discriminations
against
any
product
of
the
united
states
placed
this
government
in
a
position
to
effectively
urge
the
removal
of
such
discriminations
against
our
meats
it
is
gratifying
to
be
able
to
state
that
germany
denmark
italy
austria
and
france
in
the
order
named
have
opened
their
ports
to
inspected
american
pork
products
the
removal
of
these
restrictions
in
every
instance
was
asked
for
and
given
solely
upon
the
ground
that
we
have
now
provided
a
meat
inspection
that
should
be
accepted
as
adequate
to
the
complete
removal
of
the
dangers
real
or
fancied
which
had
been
previously
urged
the
state
department
our
ministers
abroad
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
have
cooperated
with
unflagging
and
intelligent
zeal
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
great
result
the
outlines
of
an
agreement
have
been
reached
with
germany
looking
to
equitable
trade
concessions
in
consideration
of
the
continued
free
importation
of
her
sugars
but
the
time
has
not
yet
arrived
when
this
correspondence
can
be
submitted
to
congress
the
recent
political
disturbances
in
the
republic
of
brazil
have
excited
regret
and
solicitude
the
information
we
possessed
was
too
meager
to
enable
us
to
form
a
satisfactory
judgment
of
the
causes
leading
to
the
temporary
assumption
of
supreme
power
by
president
fonseca
but
this
government
did
not
fail
to
express
to
him
its
anxious
solicitude
for
the
peace
of
brazil
and
for
the
maintenance
of
the
free
political
institutions
which
had
recently
been
established
there
nor
to
offer
our
advice
that
great
moderation
should
be
observed
in
the
clash
of
parties
and
the
contest
for
leadership
these
counsels
were
received
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
and
the
latest
information
is
that
constitutional
government
has
been
reestablished
without
bloodshed
the
lynching
at
new
orleans
in
march
last
of
eleven
men
of
italian
nativity
by
a
mob
of
citizens
was
a
most
deplorable
and
discreditable
incident
it
did
not
however
have
its
origin
in
any
general
animosity
to
the
italian
people
nor
in
any
disrespect
to
the
government
of
italy
with
which
our
relations
were
of
the
most
friendly
character
the
fury
of
the
mob
was
directed
against
these
men
as
the
supposed
participants
or
accessories
in
the
murder
of
a
city
officer
i
do
not
allude
to
this
as
mitigating
in
any
degree
this
offense
against
law
and
humanity
but
only
as
affecting
the
international
questions
which
grew
out
of
it
it
was
at
once
represented
by
the
italian
minister
that
several
of
those
whose
lives
had
been
taken
by
the
mob
were
italian
subjects
and
a
demand
was
made
for
the
punishment
of
the
participants
and
for
an
indemnity
to
the
families
of
those
who
were
killed
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
manner
in
which
these
claims
were
presented
was
not
such
as
to
promote
a
calm
discussion
of
the
questions
involved
but
this
may
well
be
attributed
to
the
excitement
and
indignation
which
the
crime
naturally
evoked
the
views
of
this
government
as
to
its
obligations
to
foreigners
domiciled
here
were
fully
stated
in
the
correspondence
as
well
as
its
purpose
to
make
an
investigation
of
the
affair
with
a
view
to
determine
whether
there
were
present
any
circumstances
that
could
under
such
rules
of
duty
as
we
had
indicated
create
an
obligation
upon
the
united
states
the
temporary
absence
of
a
minister
plenipotentiary
of
italy
at
this
capital
has
retarded
the
further
correspondence
but
it
is
not
doubted
that
a
friendly
conclusion
is
attainable
some
suggestions
growing
out
of
this
unhappy
incident
are
worthy
the
attention
of
congress
it
would
i
believe
be
entirely
competent
for
congress
to
make
offenses
against
the
treaty
rights
of
foreigners
domiciled
in
the
united
states
cognizable
in
the
federal
courts
this
has
not
however
been
done
and
the
federal
officers
and
courts
have
no
power
in
such
cases
to
intervene
either
for
the
protection
of
a
foreign
citizen
or
for
the
punishment
of
his
slayers
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
in
this
state
of
the
law
that
the
officers
of
the
state
charged
with
police
and
judicial
powers
in
such
cases
must
in
the
consideration
of
international
questions
growing
out
of
such
incidents
be
regarded
in
such
sense
as
federal
agents
as
to
make
this
government
answerable
for
their
acts
in
cases
where
it
would
be
answerable
if
the
united
states
had
used
its
constitutional
power
to
define
and
punish
crime
against
treaty
rights
the
civil
war
in
chile
which
began
in
january
last
was
continued
but
fortunately
with
infrequent
and
not
important
armed
collisions
until
august
when
the
congressional
forces
landed
near
valparaiso
and
after
a
bloody
engagement
captured
that
city
president
balmaceda
at
once
recognized
that
his
cause
was
lost
and
a
provisional
government
was
speedily
established
by
the
victorious
party
our
minister
was
promptly
directed
to
recognize
and
put
himself
in
communication
with
this
government
so
soon
as
it
should
have
established
its
de
facto
character
which
was
done
during
the
pendency
of
this
civil
contest
frequent
indirect
appeals
were
made
to
this
government
to
extend
belligerent
rights
to
the
insurgents
and
to
give
audience
to
their
representatives
this
was
declined
and
that
policy
was
pursued
throughout
which
this
government
when
wrenched
by
civil
war
so
strenuously
insisted
upon
on
the
part
of
european
nations
the
itata
an
armed
vessel
commanded
by
a
naval
officer
of
the
insurgent
fleet
manned
by
its
sailors
and
with
soldiers
on
board
was
seized
under
process
of
the
united
states
court
at
san
diego
cal
for
a
violation
of
our
neutrality
laws
while
in
the
custody
of
an
officer
of
the
co
urt
the
vessel
was
forcibly
wrested
from
his
control
and
put
to
sea
it
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
and
selfrespect
of
this
government
not
to
have
insisted
that
the
itala
should
be
returned
to
san
diego
to
abide
the
judgment
of
the
court
this
was
so
clear
to
the
junta
of
the
congressional
party
established
at
iquique
that
before
the
arrival
of
the
itata
at
that
port
the
secretary
of
foreign
relations
of
the
provisional
government
addressed
to
rearadmiral
brown
commanding
the
united
states
naval
forces
a
communication
from
which
the
following
is
an
extract
the
provisional
government
has
learned
by
the
cablegrams
of
the
associated
press
that
the
transport
itata
detained
in
san
diego
by
order
of
the
united
states
for
taking
on
board
munitions
of
war
and
in
possession
of
the
marshal
left
the
port
carrying
on
board
this
official
who
was
landed
at
a
point
near
the
coast
and
then
continued
her
voyage
if
this
news
be
correct
this
government
would
deplore
the
conduct
of
the
itata
and
as
an
evidence
that
it
is
not
disposed
to
support
or
agree
to
the
infraction
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
the
undersigned
takes
advantage
of
the
personal
relations
you
have
been
good
enough
to
maintain
with
him
since
your
arrival
in
this
port
to
declare
to
you
that
as
soon
as
she
is
within
reach
of
our
orders
his
government
will
put
the
itata
with
the
arms
and
munitions
she
took
on
board
in
sail
diego
at
the
disposition
of
the
united
states
a
trial
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
southern
district
of
california
has
recently
resulted
in
a
decision
holding
among
other
things
that
inasmuch
as
the
congressional
party
had
not
been
recognized
as
a
belligerent
the
acts
done
in
its
interest
could
not
be
a
violation
of
our
neutrality
laws
from
this
judgment
the
united
states
has
appealed
not
that
the
condemnation
of
the
vessel
is
a
matter
of
importance
but
that
we
may
know
what
the
present
state
of
our
law
is
for
if
this
construction
of
the
statute
is
correct
there
is
obvious
necessity
for
revision
and
amendment
during
the
progress
of
the
war
in
chile
this
government
tendered
its
good
offices
to
bring
about
a
peaceful
adjustment
and
it
was
at
one
time
hoped
that
a
good
result
might
be
reached
but
in
this
we
were
disappointed
the
instructions
to
our
naval
officers
and
to
our
minister
at
santiago
from
the
first
to
the
last
of
this
struggle
enjoined
upon
them
the
most
impartial
treatment
and
absolute
noninterference
i
am
satisfied
that
these
instructions
were
observed
and
that
our
representatives
were
always
watchful
to
use
their
influence
impartially
in
the
interest
of
humanity
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
did
so
effectively
we
could
not
forget
however
that
this
government
was
in
diplomatic
relations
with
the
then
established
government
of
chile
as
it
is
now
in
such
relations
with
the
successor
of
that
government
i
am
quite
sure
that
president
montt
who
has
under
circumstances
of
promise
for
the
peace
of
chile
been
installed
as
president
of
that
republic
will
not
desire
that
in
the
unfortunate
event
of
any
revolt
against
his
authority
the
policy
of
this
government
should
be
other
than
that
which
we
have
recently
observed
no
official
complaint
of
the
conduct
of
our
minister
or
of
our
naval
officers
during
the
struggle
has
been
presented
to
this
government
and
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
that
so
many
of
our
own
people
should
have
given
ear
to
unofficial
charges
and
complaints
that
manifestly
had
their
origin
in
rival
interests
and
in
a
wish
to
pervert
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
chile
the
collapse
of
the
government
of
balmaceda
brought
about
a
condition
which
is
unfortunately
too
familiar
in
the
history
of
the
central
and
south
american
states
with
the
overthrow
of
the
balmaceda
government
he
and
many
of
his
councilors
and
officers
became
at
once
fugitives
for
their
lives
and
appealed
to
the
commanding
officers
of
the
foreign
naval
vessels
in
the
harbor
of
valparaiso
and
to
the
resident
foreign
ministers
at
santiago
for
asylum
this
asylum
was
freely
given
according
to
my
information
by
the
naval
vessels
of
several
foreign
powers
and
by
several
of
the
legations
at
santiago
the
american
minister
as
well
as
his
colleagues
acting
upon
the
impulse
of
humanity
extended
asylum
to
political
refugees
whose
lives
were
in
peril
i
have
not
been
willing
to
direct
the
surrender
of
such
of
these
persons
as
are
still
in
the
american
legation
without
suitable
conditions
it
is
believed
that
the
government
of
chile
is
not
in
a
position
in
view
of
the
precedents
with
which
it
has
been
connected
to
broadly
deny
the
right
of
asylum
and
the
correspondence
has
not
thus
far
presented
any
such
denial
the
treatment
of
our
minister
for
a
time
was
such
as
to
call
for
a
decided
protest
and
it
was
very
gratifying
to
observe
that
unfriendly
measures
which
were
undoubtedly
the
result
of
the
prevailing
excitement
were
at
once
rescinded
or
suitably
relaxed
on
the
th
of
october
an
event
occurred
in
valparaiso
so
serious
and
tragic
in
its
circumstances
and
results
as
to
very
justly
excite
the
indignation
of
our
people
and
to
call
for
prompt
and
decided
action
on
the
part
of
this
government
a
considerable
number
of
the
sailors
of
the
united
states
steamship
baltimore
then
in
the
harbor
at
valparaiso
being
upon
shore
leave
and
unarmed
were
assaulted
by
armed
men
nearly
simultaneously
in
different
localities
in
the
city
one
petty
officer
was
killed
outright
and
seven
or
eight
seamen
were
seriously
wounded
one
of
whom
has
since
died
so
savage
and
brutal
was
the
assault
that
several
of
our
sailors
received
more
than
two
and
one
as
many
as
eighteen
stab
wounds
an
investigation
of
the
affair
was
promptly
made
by
a
board
of
officers
of
the
baltimore
and
their
report
shows
that
these
assaults
were
unprovoked
that
our
men
were
conducting
themselves
in
a
peaceable
and
orderly
manner
and
that
some
of
the
police
of
the
city
took
part
in
the
assault
and
used
their
weapons
with
fatal
effect
while
a
few
others
with
some
welldisposed
citizens
endeavored
to
protect
our
men
thirtysix
of
our
sailors
were
arrested
and
some
of
them
while
being
taken
to
prison
were
cruelly
beaten
and
maltreated
the
fact
that
they
were
all
discharged
no
criminal
charge
being
lodged
against
any
one
of
them
shows
very
clearly
that
they
were
innocent
of
any
breach
of
the
peace
so
far
as
i
have
yet
been
able
to
learn
no
other
explanation
of
this
bloody
work
has
been
suggested
than
that
it
had
its
origin
in
hostility
to
those
men
as
sailors
of
the
united
states
wearing
the
uniform
of
their
government
and
not
in
any
individual
act
or
personal
animosity
the
attention
of
the
chilean
government
was
at
once
called
to
this
affair
and
a
statement
of
the
facts
obtained
by
the
investigation
we
had
conducted
was
submitted
accompanied
by
a
request
to
be
advised
of
any
other
or
qualifying
facts
in
the
possession
of
the
chilean
government
that
might
tend
to
relieve
this
affair
of
the
appearance
of
an
insult
to
this
government
the
chilean
government
was
also
advised
that
if
such
qualifying
facts
did
not
exist
this
government
would
confidently
expect
full
and
prompt
reparation
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
reply
of
the
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
of
the
provisional
government
was
couched
in
an
offensive
tone
to
this
no
response
has
been
made
this
government
is
now
awaiting
the
result
of
an
investigation
which
has
been
conducted
by
the
criminal
court
at
valparaiso
it
is
reported
unofficially
that
the
investigation
is
about
completed
and
it
is
expected
that
the
result
will
soon
be
communicated
to
this
government
together
with
some
adequate
and
satisfactory
response
to
the
note
by
which
the
attention
of
chile
was
called
to
this
incident
if
these
just
expectations
should
be
disappointed
or
further
needless
delay
intervene
i
will
by
a
special
message
bring
this
matter
again
to
the
attention
of
congress
for
such
action
as
may
be
necessary
the
entire
correspondence
with
the
government
of
chile
will
at
an
early
day
be
submitted
to
congress
i
renew
the
recommendation
of
my
special
message
dated
january
for
the
adoption
of
the
necessary
legislation
to
enable
this
government
to
apply
in
the
case
of
sweden
and
norway
the
same
rule
in
respect
to
the
levying
of
tonnage
dues
as
was
claimed
and
secured
to
the
shipping
of
the
united
states
in
under
article
viii
of
the
treaty
of
the
adjournment
of
the
senate
without
action
on
the
pending
acts
for
the
suppression
of
the
slave
traffic
in
africa
and
for
the
reform
of
the
revenue
tariff
of
the
independent
state
of
the
kongo
left
this
government
unable
to
exchange
those
acts
on
the
date
fixed
july
a
modus
vivendi
has
been
concluded
by
which
the
power
of
the
kongo
state
to
levy
duties
on
imports
is
left
unimpaired
and
by
agreement
of
all
the
signatories
to
the
general
slavetrade
act
the
time
for
the
exchange
of
ratifications
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
has
been
extended
to
february
the
late
outbreak
against
foreigners
in
various
parts
of
the
chinese
empire
has
been
a
cause
of
deep
concern
in
view
of
the
numerous
establishments
of
our
citizens
in
the
interior
of
that
country
this
government
can
do
no
less
than
insist
upon
a
continuance
of
the
protective
and
punitory
measures
which
the
chinese
government
has
heretofore
applied
no
effort
will
be
omitted
to
protect
our
citizens
peaceably
sojourning
in
china
but
recent
unofficial
information
indicates
that
what
was
at
first
regarded
as
an
outbreak
of
mob
violence
against
foreigners
has
assumed
the
larger
form
of
an
insurrection
against
public
order
the
chinese
government
has
declined
to
receive
mr
blair
as
the
minister
of
the
united
states
on
the
ground
that
as
a
participant
while
a
senator
in
the
enactment
of
the
existing
legislation
against
the
introduction
of
chinese
laborers
he
has
become
unfriendly
and
objectionable
to
china
i
have
felt
constrained
to
point
out
to
the
chinese
government
the
untenableness
of
this
position
which
seems
to
rest
as
much
on
the
unacceptability
of
our
legislation
as
on
that
of
the
perso
n
chosen
and
which
if
admitted
would
practically
debar
the
selection
of
any
representative
so
long
as
the
existing
laws
remain
in
force
you
will
be
called
upon
to
consider
the
expediency
of
making
special
provision
by
law
for
the
temporary
admission
of
some
chinese
artisans
and
laborers
in
connection
with
the
exhibit
of
chinese
industries
at
the
approaching
columbian
exposition
i
regard
it
as
desirable
that
the
chinese
exhibit
be
facilitated
in
every
proper
way
a
question
has
arisen
with
the
government
of
spain
touching
the
rights
of
american
citizens
in
the
caroline
islands
our
citizens
there
long
prior
to
the
confirmation
of
spains
claim
to
the
islands
had
secured
by
settlement
and
purchase
certain
rights
to
the
recognition
and
maintenance
of
which
the
faith
of
spain
was
pledged
i
have
had
reason
within
the
past
year
very
strongly
to
protest
against
the
failure
to
carry
out
this
pledge
on
the
part
of
his
majestys
ministers
which
has
resulted
in
great
injustice
and
injury
to
the
american
residents
the
government
and
people
of
spain
propose
to
celebrate
the
four
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
discovery
of
america
by
holding
an
exposition
at
madrid
which
will
open
on
the
th
of
september
and
continue
until
the
st
of
december
a
cordial
invitation
has
been
extended
to
the
united
states
to
take
part
in
this
commemoration
and
as
spain
was
one
of
the
first
nations
to
express
the
intention
to
participate
in
the
worlds
columbian
exposition
at
chicago
it
would
be
very
appropriate
for
this
government
to
give
this
invitation
its
friendly
promotion
surveys
for
the
connecting
links
of
the
projected
intercontinental
railway
are
in
progress
not
only
in
mexico
but
at
various
points
along
the
course
mapped
out
three
surveying
parties
are
now
in
the
field
under
the
direction
of
the
commission
nearly
miles
of
the
proposed
road
have
been
surveyed
including
the
most
difficult
part
that
through
ecuador
and
the
southern
part
of
colombia
the
reports
of
the
engineers
are
very
satisfactory
and
show
that
no
insurmountable
obstacles
have
been
met
with
on
november
a
treaty
was
concluded
with
mexico
reaffirming
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
as
described
in
the
treaties
of
february
and
december
march
a
further
treaty
was
negotiated
to
facilitate
the
carrying
out
of
the
principles
of
the
treaty
of
and
to
avoid
the
difficulties
occasioned
by
reason
of
the
changes
and
alterations
that
take
place
from
natural
causes
in
the
rio
grande
and
colorado
rivers
in
the
portions
thereof
constituting
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republics
the
international
boundary
commission
provided
for
by
the
treaty
of
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
any
question
that
may
arise
has
been
named
by
the
mexican
government
an
appropriation
is
necessary
to
enable
the
united
states
to
fulfill
its
treaty
obligations
in
this
respect
the
death
of
king
kalakaua
in
the
united
states
afforded
occasion
to
testify
our
friendship
for
hawaii
by
conveying
the
kings
body
to
his
own
land
in
a
naval
vessel
with
all
due
honors
the
government
of
his
successor
queen
liliuokolani
is
seeking
to
promote
closer
commercial
relations
with
the
united
states
surveys
for
the
muchneeded
submarine
cable
from
our
pacific
coast
to
honolulu
are
in
progress
and
this
enterprise
should
have
the
suitable
promotion
of
the
two
governments
i
strongly
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
improving
the
harbor
of
pearl
river
and
equipping
it
as
a
naval
station
the
arbitration
treaty
formulated
by
the
international
american
conference
lapsed
by
reason
of
the
failure
to
exchange
ratifications
fully
within
the
limit
of
time
provided
but
several
of
the
governments
concerned
have
expressed
a
desire
to
save
this
important
result
of
the
conference
by
an
extension
of
the
period
it
is
in
my
judgment
incumbent
upon
the
united
states
to
conserve
the
influential
initiative
it
has
taken
in
this
measure
by
ratifying
the
instrument
and
by
advocating
the
proposed
extension
of
the
time
for
exchange
these
views
have
been
made
known
to
the
other
signatories
this
government
has
found
occasion
to
express
in
a
friendly
spirit
but
with
much
earnestness
to
the
government
of
the
czar
its
serious
concern
because
of
the
harsh
measures
now
being
enforced
against
the
hebrews
in
russia
by
the
revival
of
antisemitic
laws
long
in
abeyance
great
numbers
of
those
unfortunate
people
have
been
constrained
to
abandon
their
homes
and
leave
the
empire
by
reason
of
the
impossibility
of
finding
subsistence
within
the
pale
to
which
it
is
sought
to
confine
them
the
immigration
of
these
people
to
the
united
statesmany
other
countries
being
closed
to
themis
largely
increasing
and
is
likely
to
assume
proportions
which
may
make
it
difficult
to
find
homes
and
employment
for
them
here
and
to
seriously
affect
the
labor
market
it
is
estimated
that
over
will
be
forced
from
russia
within
a
few
years
the
hebrew
is
never
a
beggar
he
has
always
kept
the
lawlife
by
toiloften
under
severe
and
oppressive
civil
restrictions
it
is
also
true
that
no
race
sect
or
class
has
more
fully
cared
for
its
own
than
the
hebrew
race
but
the
sudden
transfer
of
such
a
multitude
under
conditions
that
tend
to
strip
them
of
their
small
accumulations
and
to
depress
their
energies
and
courage
is
neither
good
for
them
nor
for
us
the
banishment
whether
by
direct
decree
or
by
not
less
certain
indirect
methods
of
so
large
a
number
of
men
and
women
is
not
a
local
question
a
decree
to
leave
one
country
is
in
the
nature
of
things
an
order
to
enter
anothersome
other
this
consideration
as
well
as
the
suggestion
of
humanity
furnishes
ample
ground
for
the
remonstrances
which
we
have
presented
to
russia
while
our
historic
friendship
for
that
government
can
not
fail
to
give
the
assurance
that
our
representations
are
those
of
a
sincere
wellwisher
the
annual
report
of
the
maritime
canal
company
of
nicaragua
shows
that
much
costly
and
necessary
preparatory
work
has
been
done
during
the
year
in
the
construction
of
shops
railroad
tracks
and
harbor
piers
and
breakwaters
and
that
the
work
of
canal
construction
has
made
some
progress
i
deem
it
to
be
a
matter
of
the
highest
concern
to
the
united
states
that
this
canal
connecting
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
and
giving
to
us
a
short
water
communication
between
our
ports
upon
those
two
great
seas
should
be
speedily
constructed
and
at
the
smallest
practicable
limit
of
cost
the
gain
in
freights
to
the
people
and
the
direct
saving
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
use
of
its
naval
vessels
would
pay
the
entire
cost
of
this
work
within
a
short
series
of
years
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
the
saving
in
our
naval
expenditures
which
would
result
the
senator
from
alabama
mr
morgan
in
his
argument
upon
this
subject
before
the
senate
at
the
last
session
did
not
overestimate
the
importance
of
this
work
when
he
said
that
the
canal
is
the
most
important
subject
now
connected
with
the
commercial
growth
and
progress
of
the
united
states
if
this
work
is
to
be
promoted
by
the
usual
financial
methods
and
without
the
aid
of
this
government
the
expenditures
in
its
interestbearing
securities
and
stock
will
probably
be
twice
the
actual
cost
this
will
necessitate
higher
tolls
and
constitute
a
heavy
and
altogether
needless
burden
upon
our
commerce
and
that
of
the
world
every
dollar
of
the
bonds
and
stock
of
the
company
should
represent
a
dollar
expended
in
the
legitimate
and
economical
prosecution
of
the
work
this
is
only
possible
by
giving
to
the
bonds
the
guaranty
of
the
united
states
government
such
a
guaranty
would
secure
the
ready
sale
at
par
of
a
per
cent
bond
from
time
to
time
as
the
money
was
needed
i
do
not
doubt
that
built
upon
these
business
methods
the
canal
would
when
fully
inaugurated
earn
its
fixed
charges
and
operating
expenses
but
if
its
bonds
are
to
be
marketed
at
heavy
discounts
and
every
bond
sold
is
to
be
accompanied
by
a
gift
of
stock
as
has
come
to
be
expected
by
investors
in
such
enterprises
the
traffic
will
be
seriously
burdened
to
pay
interest
and
dividends
i
am
quite
willing
to
recommend
government
promotion
in
the
prosecution
of
a
work
which
if
no
other
means
offered
for
securing
its
completion
is
of
such
transcendent
interest
that
the
government
should
in
my
opinion
secure
it
by
direct
appropriations
from
its
treasury
a
guaranty
of
the
bonds
of
the
canal
company
to
an
amount
necessary
to
the
completion
of
the
canal
could
i
think
be
so
given
as
not
to
involve
any
serious
risk
of
ultimate
loss
the
things
to
be
carefully
guarded
are
the
completion
of
the
work
within
the
limits
of
the
guaranty
the
subrogation
of
the
united
states
to
the
rights
of
the
firstmortgage
bondholders
for
any
amounts
it
may
have
to
pay
and
in
the
meantime
a
control
of
the
stock
of
the
company
as
a
security
against
mismanagement
and
loss
i
most
sincerely
hope
that
neither
party
nor
sectional
lines
will
be
drawn
upon
this
great
american
project
so
full
of
interest
to
the
people
of
all
our
states
and
so
influential
in
its
effects
upon
the
prestige
and
prosperity
of
our
common
country
the
island
of
navassa
in
the
west
indian
group
has
under
the
provisions
of
title
vii
of
the
revised
statutes
been
recognized
by
the
president
as
appertaining
to
the
united
states
it
contains
guano
deposits
is
owned
by
the
navassa
phosphate
company
and
is
occupied
solely
its
employees
in
september
a
revolt
took
place
among
these
laborers
resulting
in
the
killing
of
some
of
the
agents
of
the
company
caused
as
the
laborers
claimed
by
cruel
treatment
these
men
were
arrested
and
tried
in
the
united
states
court
at
baltimore
under
section
of
the
statute
referred
to
as
if
the
offenses
had
been
committed
on
board
a
merchant
vessel
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas
there
appeared
on
the
trial
and
otherwise
came
to
me
such
evidences
of
the
bad
treatment
of
the
men
that
in
consideration
of
this
and
of
the
fact
that
the
men
had
no
access
to
any
public
officer
or
tribunal
for
protection
or
the
redress
of
their
wrongs
i
commuted
the
death
sentences
that
had
been
passe
d
by
the
court
upon
three
of
them
in
april
last
my
attention
was
again
called
to
this
island
and
to
the
unregulated
condition
of
things
there
by
a
letter
from
a
colored
laborer
who
complained
that
he
was
wrongfully
detained
upon
the
island
by
the
phosphate
company
after
the
expiration
of
his
contract
of
service
a
naval
vessel
was
sent
to
examine
into
the
case
of
this
man
and
generally
into
the
condition
of
things
on
the
island
it
was
found
that
the
laborer
referred
to
had
been
detained
beyond
the
contract
limit
and
that
a
condition
of
revolt
again
existed
among
the
laborers
a
board
of
naval
officers
reported
among
other
things
as
follows
we
would
desire
to
state
further
that
the
discipline
maintained
on
the
island
seems
to
be
that
of
a
convict
establishment
without
its
comforts
and
cleanliness
and
that
until
more
attention
is
paid
to
the
shipping
of
laborers
by
placing
it
under
government
supervision
to
prevent
misunderstanding
and
misrepresentation
and
until
some
amelioration
is
shown
in
the
treatment
of
the
laborers
these
disorders
will
be
of
constant
occurrence
i
recommend
legislation
that
shall
place
labor
contracts
upon
this
and
other
islands
having
the
relation
that
navassa
has
to
the
united
states
under
the
supervision
of
a
court
commissioner
and
that
shall
provide
at
the
expense
of
the
owners
an
officer
to
reside
upon
the
island
with
power
to
judge
and
adjust
disputes
and
to
enforce
a
just
and
humane
treatment
of
the
employees
it
is
inexcusable
that
american
laborers
should
be
left
within
our
own
jurisdiction
without
access
to
any
government
officer
or
tribunal
for
their
protection
and
the
redress
of
their
wrongs
international
copyright
has
been
secured
in
accordance
with
the
conditions
of
the
act
of
march
with
belgium
france
great
britain
and
the
british
possessions
and
switzerland
the
laws
of
those
countries
permitting
to
our
citizens
the
benefit
of
copyright
on
substantially
the
same
basis
as
to
their
own
citizens
or
subjects
with
germany
a
special
convention
has
been
negotiated
upon
this
subject
which
will
bring
that
country
within
the
reciprocal
benefits
of
our
legislation
the
general
interest
in
the
operations
of
the
treasury
department
has
been
much
augmented
during
the
last
year
by
reason
of
the
conflicting
predictions
which
accompanied
and
followed
the
tariff
and
other
legislation
of
the
last
congress
affecting
the
revenues
as
to
the
results
of
this
legislation
upon
the
treasury
and
upon
the
country
on
the
one
hand
it
was
contended
that
imports
would
so
fall
off
as
to
leave
the
treasury
bankrupt
and
that
the
prices
of
articles
entering
into
the
living
of
the
people
would
be
so
enhanced
as
to
disastrously
affect
their
comfort
and
happiness
while
on
the
other
it
was
argued
that
the
loss
to
the
revenue
largely
the
result
of
placing
sugar
on
the
free
list
would
be
a
direct
gain
to
the
people
that
the
prices
of
the
necessaries
of
life
including
those
most
highly
protected
would
not
be
enhanced
that
labor
would
have
a
larger
market
and
the
products
of
the
farm
advanced
prices
while
the
treasury
surplus
and
receipts
would
be
adequate
to
meet
the
appropriations
including
the
large
exceptional
expenditures
for
the
refunding
to
the
states
of
the
direct
tax
and
the
redemption
of
the
per
cent
bonds
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
enter
at
any
length
into
a
discussion
of
the
effects
of
the
legislation
to
which
i
have
referred
but
a
brief
examination
of
the
statistics
of
the
treasury
and
a
general
glance
at
the
state
of
business
throughout
the
country
will
i
think
satisfy
any
impartial
inquirer
that
its
results
have
disappointed
the
evil
prophecies
of
its
opponents
and
in
a
large
measure
realized
the
hopeful
predictions
of
its
friends
rarely
if
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
country
has
there
been
a
time
when
the
proceeds
of
one
days
labor
or
the
product
of
one
farmed
acre
would
purchase
so
large
an
amount
of
those
things
that
enter
into
the
living
of
the
masses
of
the
people
i
believe
that
a
full
test
will
develop
the
fact
that
the
tariff
act
of
the
fiftyfirst
congress
is
very
favorable
in
its
average
effect
upon
the
prices
of
articles
entering
into
common
use
during
the
twelve
months
from
october
to
september
the
total
value
of
our
foreign
commerce
imports
and
exports
combined
was
which
was
the
largest
of
any
year
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
the
largest
in
any
previous
year
was
in
when
our
commerce
amounted
to
and
the
last
year
exceeds
this
enormous
aggregate
by
over
one
hundred
millions
it
is
interesting
and
to
some
will
be
surprising
to
know
that
during
the
year
ending
september
our
imports
of
merchandise
amounted
to
which
was
an
increase
of
more
than
over
the
value
of
the
imports
of
the
corresponding
months
of
the
preceding
year
when
the
imports
of
merchandise
were
unusually
large
in
anticipation
of
the
tariff
legislation
then
pending
the
average
annual
value
of
the
imports
of
merchandise
for
the
ten
years
from
to
was
and
during
the
year
ending
september
this
annual
average
was
exceeded
by
the
value
of
free
imports
during
the
twelve
months
ending
september
was
more
than
the
value
of
free
imports
during
the
corresponding
twelve
months
of
the
preceding
year
and
there
was
during
the
same
period
a
decrease
of
in
the
value
of
imports
of
dutiable
merchandise
the
percentage
of
merchandise
admitted
free
of
duty
during
the
year
to
which
i
have
referred
the
first
under
the
new
tariff
was
while
during
the
preceding
twelve
months
under
the
old
tariff
the
percentage
was
an
increase
of
per
cent
if
we
take
the
six
months
ending
september
last
which
covers
the
time
during
which
sugars
have
been
admitted
free
of
duty
the
per
cent
of
value
of
merchandise
imported
free
of
duty
is
found
to
be
which
is
a
larger
percentage
of
free
imports
than
during
any
prior
fiscal
year
in
the
history
of
the
government
if
we
turn
to
exports
of
merchandise
the
statistics
are
full
of
gratification
the
value
of
such
exports
of
merchandise
for
the
twelve
months
ending
september
was
while
for
the
corresponding
previous
twelve
months
it
was
an
increase
of
which
is
nearly
three
times
the
average
annual
increase
of
exports
of
merchandise
for
the
preceding
twenty
years
this
exceeds
in
amount
and
value
the
exports
of
merchandise
during
any
year
in
the
history
of
the
government
the
increase
in
the
value
of
exports
of
agricultural
products
during
the
year
referred
to
over
the
corresponding
twelve
months
of
the
prior
year
was
while
the
increase
in
the
value
of
exports
of
manufactured
products
was
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
condition
of
trade
foreign
or
domestic
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
condition
of
our
people
of
any
class
to
suggest
that
the
existing
tariff
and
revenue
legislation
bears
oppressively
upon
the
people
or
retards
the
commercial
development
of
the
nation
it
may
be
argued
that
our
condition
would
be
better
if
tariff
legislation
were
upon
a
freetrade
basis
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
all
the
conditions
of
prosperity
and
of
general
contentment
are
present
in
a
larger
degree
than
ever
before
in
our
history
and
that
too
just
when
it
was
prophesied
they
would
be
in
the
worst
state
agitation
for
radical
changes
in
tariff
and
financial
legislation
can
not
help
but
may
seriously
impede
business
to
the
prosperity
of
which
some
degree
of
stability
in
legislation
is
essential
i
think
there
are
conclusive
evidences
that
the
new
tariff
has
created
several
great
industries
which
will
within
a
few
years
give
employment
to
several
hundred
thousand
american
working
men
and
women
in
view
of
the
somewhat
overcrowded
condition
of
the
labor
market
of
the
united
states
every
patriotic
citizen
should
rejoice
at
such
a
result
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shows
that
the
total
receipts
of
the
government
from
all
sources
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
were
while
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
leaving
a
surplus
of
the
receipts
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
actual
and
estimated
are
and
the
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
the
estimated
receipts
are
and
the
expenditures
under
the
law
of
july
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
purchased
since
august
during
the
fiscal
year
ounces
of
silver
bullion
at
an
average
cost
of
per
ounce
the
highest
price
paid
during
the
year
was
and
the
lowest
in
exchange
for
this
silver
bullion
there
have
been
issued
of
the
treasury
notes
authorized
by
the
act
the
lowest
price
of
silver
reached
during
the
fiscal
year
was
on
april
but
on
november
the
market
price
was
only
which
would
give
to
the
silver
dollar
a
bullion
value
of
cents
before
the
influence
of
the
prospective
silver
legislation
was
felt
in
the
market
silver
was
worth
in
new
york
about
per
ounce
the
ablest
advocates
of
free
coinage
in
the
last
congress
were
most
confident
in
their
predictions
that
the
purchases
by
the
government
required
by
the
law
would
at
once
bring
the
price
of
silver
to
per
ounce
which
would
make
the
bullion
value
of
a
dollar
cents
and
hold
it
there
the
prophecies
of
the
antisilver
men
of
disasters
to
result
from
the
coinage
of
per
month
were
not
wider
of
the
mark
the
friends
of
free
silver
are
not
agreed
i
think
as
to
the
causes
that
brought
their
hopeful
predictions
to
naught
some
facts
are
known
the
exports
of
silver
from
london
to
india
during
the
first
nine
months
of
this
calendar
year
fell
off
over
per
cent
or
compared
with
the
same
months
of
the
preceding
year
the
exports
of
domestic
silver
bullion
from
this
country
which
had
averaged
for
the
last
ten
years
over
fell
in
the
last
fiscal
year
to
while
for
the
first
time
in
recent
years
the
imports
of
silver
into
this
country
exceeded
the
exports
by
the
sum
of
in
the
previous
year
the
net
exports
of
silver
from
the
united
states
amounted
to
the
production
of
the
united
states
increased
from
ounces
in
to
in
the
government
is
now
buying
and
putting
aside
annually
ounces
which
allowing
for
ounces
of
new
bullion
used
in
the
arts
is
more
than
our
domestic
products
available
for
coinage
i
hope
the
depression
in
the
price
of
silver
is
temporary
and
that
a

further
trial
of
this
legislation
will
more
favorably
affect
it
that
the
increased
volume
of
currency
thus
supplied
for
the
use
of
the
people
was
needed
and
that
beneficial
results
upon
trade
and
prices
have
followed
this
legislation
i
think
must
be
very
clear
to
everyone
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
for
every
dollar
of
these
notes
issued
a
full
dollars
worth
of
silver
bullion
is
at
the
time
deposited
in
the
treasury
as
a
security
for
its
redemption
upon
this
subject
as
upon
the
tariff
my
recommendation
is
that
the
existing
laws
be
given
a
full
trial
and
that
our
business
interests
be
spared
the
distressing
influence
which
threats
of
radical
changes
always
impart
under
existing
legislation
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
treasury
department
to
maintain
that
essential
condition
of
national
finance
as
well
as
of
commercial
prosperitythe
parity
in
use
of
the
coined
dollars
and
their
paper
representatives
the
assurance
that
these
powers
would
be
freely
and
unhesitatingly
used
has
done
much
to
produce
and
sustain
the
present
favorable
business
conditions
i
am
still
of
the
opinion
that
the
free
coinage
of
silver
under
existing
conditions
would
disastrously
affect
our
business
interests
at
home
and
abroad
we
could
not
hope
to
maintain
an
equality
in
the
purchasing
power
of
the
gold
and
silver
dollar
in
our
own
markets
and
in
foreign
trade
the
stamp
gives
no
added
value
to
the
bullion
contained
in
coins
the
producers
of
the
country
its
farmers
and
laborers
have
the
highest
interest
that
every
dollar
paper
or
coin
issued
by
the
government
shall
be
as
good
as
any
other
if
there
is
one
less
valuable
than
another
its
sure
and
constant
errand
will
be
to
pay
them
for
their
toil
and
for
their
crops
the
money
lender
will
protect
himself
by
stipulating
for
payment
in
gold
but
the
laborer
has
never
been
able
to
do
that
to
place
business
upon
a
silver
basis
would
mean
a
sudden
and
severe
contraction
of
the
currency
by
the
withdrawal
of
gold
and
gold
notes
and
such
an
unsettling
of
all
values
as
would
produce
a
commercial
panic
i
can
not
believe
that
a
people
so
strong
and
prosperous
as
ours
will
promote
such
a
policy
the
producers
of
silver
are
entitled
to
just
consideration
but
they
should
not
forget
that
the
government
is
now
buying
and
putting
out
of
the
market
what
is
the
equivalent
of
the
entire
product
of
our
silver
mines
this
is
more
than
they
themselves
thought
of
asking
two
years
ago
i
believe
it
is
the
earnest
desire
of
a
great
majority
of
the
people
as
it
is
mine
that
a
full
coin
use
shall
be
made
of
silver
just
as
soon
as
the
cooperation
of
other
nations
can
be
secured
and
a
ratio
fixed
that
will
give
circulation
equally
to
gold
and
silver
the
business
of
the
world
requires
the
use
of
both
metals
but
i
do
not
see
any
prospect
of
gain
but
much
of
loss
by
giving
up
the
present
system
in
which
a
full
use
is
made
of
gold
and
a
large
use
of
silver
for
one
in
which
silver
alone
will
circulate
such
an
event
would
be
at
once
fatal
to
the
further
progress
of
the
silver
movement
bimetallism
is
the
desired
end
and
the
true
friends
of
silver
will
be
careful
not
to
overrun
the
goal
and
bring
in
silver
monometallism
with
its
necessary
attendantsthe
loss
of
our
gold
to
europe
and
the
relief
of
the
pressure
there
for
a
larger
currency
i
have
endeavored
by
the
use
of
official
and
unofficial
agencies
to
keep
a
close
observation
of
the
state
of
public
sentiment
in
europe
upon
this
question
and
have
not
found
it
to
be
such
as
to
justify
me
in
proposing
an
international
conference
there
is
however
i
am
sure
a
growing
sentiment
in
europe
in
favor
of
a
larger
use
of
silver
and
i
know
of
no
more
effectual
way
of
promoting
this
sentiment
than
by
accumulating
gold
here
a
scarcity
of
gold
in
the
european
reserves
will
be
the
most
persuasive
argument
for
the
use
of
silver
the
exports
of
gold
to
europe
which
began
in
february
last
and
continued
until
the
close
of
july
aggregated
over
the
net
loss
of
gold
during
the
fiscal
year
was
nearly
that
no
serious
monetary
disturbance
resulted
was
most
gratifying
and
gave
to
europe
fresh
evidence
of
the
strength
and
stability
of
our
financial
institutions
with
the
movement
of
crops
the
outflow
of
gold
was
speedily
stopped
and
a
return
set
in
up
to
december
we
had
recovered
of
our
gold
lost
at
the
port
of
new
york
and
it
is
confidently
believed
that
during
the
winter
and
spring
this
aggregate
will
be
steadily
and
largely
increased
the
presence
of
a
large
cash
surplus
in
the
treasury
has
for
many
years
been
the
subject
of
much
unfavorable
criticism
and
has
furnished
an
argument
to
those
who
have
desired
to
place
the
tariff
upon
a
purely
revenue
basis
it
was
agreed
by
all
that
the
withdrawal
from
circulation
of
so
large
an
amount
of
money
was
an
embarrassment
to
the
business
of
the
country
and
made
necessary
the
intervention
of
the
department
at
frequent
intervals
to
relieve
threatened
monetary
panics
the
surplus
on
march
was
the
policy
of
applying
this
surplus
to
the
redemption
of
the
interestbearing
securities
of
the
united
states
was
thought
to
be
preferable
to
that
of
depositing
it
without
interest
in
selected
national
banks
there
have
been
redeemed
since
the
date
last
mentioned
of
interestbearing
securities
resulting
in
a
reduction
of
the
annual
interest
charge
of
the
money
which
had
been
deposited
in
banks
without
interest
has
been
gradually
withdrawn
and
used
in
the
redemption
of
bonds
the
result
of
this
policy
of
the
silver
legislation
and
of
the
refunding
of
the
per
cent
bonds
has
been
a
large
increase
of
the
money
in
circulation
at
the
date
last
named
the
circulation
was
or
per
capita
while
on
the
st
day
of
december
it
had
increased
to
or
per
capita
the
offer
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
the
holders
of
the
per
cent
bonds
to
extend
the
time
of
redemption
at
the
option
of
the
government
at
an
interest
of
per
cent
was
accepted
by
the
holders
of
about
onehalf
the
amount
and
the
unextended
bonds
are
being
redeemed
on
presentation
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
exhibits
the
results
of
an
intelligent
progressive
and
businesslike
administration
of
a
department
which
has
been
too
much
regarded
as
one
of
mere
routine
the
separation
of
secretary
proctor
from
the
department
by
reason
of
his
appointment
as
a
senator
from
the
state
of
vermont
is
a
source
of
great
regret
to
me
and
to
his
colleagues
in
the
cabinet
as
i
am
sure
it
will
be
to
all
those
who
have
had
business
with
the
department
while
under
his
charge
in
the
administration
of
army
affairs
some
especially
good
work
has
been
accomplished
the
efforts
of
the
secretary
to
reduce
the
percentage
of
desertions
by
removing
the
causes
that
promoted
it
have
been
so
successful
as
to
enable
him
to
report
for
the
last
year
a
lower
percentage
of
desertion
than
has
been
before
reached
in
the
history
of
the
army
the
resulting
money
saving
is
considerable
but
the
improvement
in
the
morale
of
the
enlisted
men
is
the
most
valuable
incident
of
the
reforms
which
have
brought
about
this
result
the
work
of
securing
sites
for
shore
batteries
for
harbor
defense
and
the
manufacture
of
mortars
and
guns
of
high
power
to
equip
them
have
made
good
progress
during
the
year
the
preliminary
work
of
tests
and
plans
which
so
long
delayed
a
start
is
now
out
of
the
way
some
guns
have
been
completed
and
with
an
enlarged
shop
and
a
more
complete
equipment
at
watervliet
the
army
will
soon
be
abreast
of
the
navy
in
gun
construction
whatever
unavoidable
causes
of
delay
may
arise
there
should
be
none
from
delayed
or
insufficient
appropriations
we
shall
be
greatly
embarrassed
in
the
proper
distribution
and
use
of
naval
vessels
until
adequate
shore
defenses
are
provided
for
our
harbors
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
that
the
threebattalion
organization
be
adopted
for
the
infantry
the
adoption
of
a
smokeless
powder
and
of
a
modern
rifle
equal
in
range
precision
and
rapidity
of
fire
to
the
best
now
in
use
will
i
hope
not
be
longer
delayed
the
project
of
enlisting
indians
and
organizing
them
into
separate
companies
upon
the
same
basis
as
other
soldiers
was
made
the
subject
of
very
careful
study
by
the
secretary
and
received
my
approval
seven
companies
have
been
completely
organized
and
seven
more
are
in
process
of
organization
the
results
of
six
months
training
have
more
than
realized
the
highest
anticipations
the
men
are
readily
brought
under
discipline
acquire
the
drill
with
facility
and
show
great
pride
in
the
right
discharge
of
their
duty
and
perfect
loyalty
to
their
officers
who
declare
that
they
would
take
them
into
action
with
confidence
the
discipline
order
and
cleanliness
of
the
military
posts
will
have
a
wholesome
and
elevating
influence
upon
the
men
enlisted
and
through
them
upon
their
tribes
while
a
friendly
feeling
for
the
whites
and
a
greater
respect
for
the
government
will
certainly
be
promoted
the
great
work
done
in
the
record
and
pension
division
of
the
war
department
by
major
ainsworth
of
the
medical
corps
and
the
clerks
under
him
is
entitled
to
honorable
mention
taking
up
the
work
with
nearly
cases
behind
he
closed
the
last
fiscal
year
without
a
single
case
left
over
though
the
new
cases
had
increased
per
cent
in
number
over
the
previous
year
by
reason
of
the
pension
legislation
of
the
last
congress
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
of
the
attorneygeneral
that
the
right
in
felony
cases
to
a
review
by
the
supreme
court
be
limited
it
would
seem
that
personal
liberty
would
have
a
safe
guaranty
if
the
right
of
review
in
cases
involving
only
fine
and
imprisonment
were
limited
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
unless
a
constitutional
question
should
in
some
way
be
involved
the
judges
of
the
court
of
private
land
claims
provided
for
by
the
act
of
march
have
been
appointed
and
the
court
organized
it
is
now
possible
to
give
early
relief
to
communities
long
repressed
in
their
development
by
unsettled
land
titles
and
to
establish
the
possession
and
right
of
settlers
whose
lands
have
been
rendered
valueless
by
adverse
and
unfounded
claims
the
act
of
july
provided
for
the

incorporation
and
management
of
a
reform
school
for
girls
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
it
has
remained
inoperative
for
the
reason
that
no
appropriation
has
been
made
for
construction
or
maintenance
the
need
of
such
an
institution
is
very
urgent
many
girls
could
be
saved
from
depraved
lives
by
the
wholesome
influences
and
restraints
of
such
a
school
i
recommend
that
the
necessary
appropriation
be
made
for
a
site
and
for
construction
the
enforcement
by
the
treasury
department
of
the
law
prohibiting
the
coming
of
chinese
to
the
united
states
has
been
effective
as
to
such
as
seek
to
land
from
vessels
entering
our
ports
the
result
has
been
to
divert
the
travel
to
vessels
entering
the
ports
of
british
columbia
whence
passage
into
the
united
states
at
obscure
points
along
the
dominion
boundary
is
easy
a
very
considerable
number
of
chinese
laborers
have
during
the
past
year
entered
the
united
states
from
canada
and
mexico
the
officers
of
the
treasury
department
and
of
the
department
of
justice
have
used
every
means
at
their
command
to
intercept
this
immigration
but
the
impossibility
of
perfectly
guarding
our
extended
frontier
is
apparent
the
dominion
government
collects
a
head
tax
of
from
every
chinaman
entering
canada
and
thus
derives
a
considerable
revenue
from
those
who
only
use
its
ports
to
reach
a
position
of
advantage
to
evade
our
exclusion
laws
there
seems
to
be
satisfactory
evidence
that
the
business
of
passing
chinamen
through
canada
to
the
united
states
is
organized
and
quite
active
the
department
of
justice
has
construed
the
laws
to
require
the
return
of
any
chinaman
found
to
be
unlawfully
in
this
country
to
china
as
the
country
from
which
he
came
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
came
by
way
of
canada
but
several
of
the
district
courts
have
in
cases
brought
before
them
overruled
this
view
of
the
law
and
decided
that
such
persons
must
be
returned
to
canada
this
construction
robs
the
law
of
all
effectiveness
even
if
the
decrees
could
be
executed
for
the
men
returned
can
the
next
day
recross
our
border
but
the
only
appropriation
made
is
for
sending
them
back
to
china
and
the
canadian
officials
refuse
to
allow
them
to
reenter
canada
without
the
payment
of
the
fiftydollar
head
tax
i
recommend
such
legislation
as
will
remedy
these
defects
in
the
law
in
previous
messages
i
have
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
necessity
of
so
extending
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
courts
as
to
make
triable
therein
any
felony
committed
while
in
the
act
of
violating
a
law
of
the
united
states
these
courts
can
not
have
that
independence
and
effectiveness
which
the
constitution
contemplates
so
long
as
the
felonious
killing
of
court
officers
jurors
and
witnesses
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
or
by
reason
of
their
acts
as
such
is
only
cognizable
in
the
state
courts
the
work
done
by
the
attorneygeneral
and
the
officers
of
his
department
even
under
the
present
inadequate
legislation
has
produced
some
notable
results
in
the
interest
of
law
and
order
the
attorneygeneral
and
also
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia
call
attention
to
the
defectiveness
and
inadequacy
of
the
laws
relating
to
crimes
against
chastity
in
the
district
of
columbia
a
stringent
code
upon
this
subject
has
been
provided
by
congress
for
utah
and
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
that
the
needs
of
this
district
should
have
been
so
long
overlooked
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
some
very
gratifying
results
are
exhibited
and
many
betterments
of
the
service
suggested
a
perusal
of
the
report
gives
abundant
evidence
that
the
supervision
and
direction
of
the
postal
system
have
been
characterized
by
an
intelligent
and
conscientious
desire
to
improve
the
service
the
revenues
of
the
department
show
an
increase
of
over
with
a
deficiency
for
the
year
of
less
than
while
the
estimate
for
the
year
shows
a
surplus
of
receipts
over
expenditures
ocean
mail
postoffices
have
been
established
upon
the
steamers
of
the
north
german
lloyd
and
hamburg
lines
saving
by
the
distribution
on
shipboard
from
two
to
fourteen
hours
time
in
the
delivery
of
mail
at
the
port
of
entry
and
often
much
more
than
this
in
the
delivery
at
interior
places
so
thoroughly
has
this
system
initiated
by
germany
and
the
united
states
evidenced
its
usefulness
that
it
can
not
be
long
before
it
is
installed
upon
all
the
great
ocean
mailcarrying
steamships
eight
thousand
miles
of
new
postal
service
has
been
established
upon
railroads
the
car
distribution
to
substations
in
the
great
cities
has
been
increased
about
per
cent
while
the
percentage
of
errors
in
distribution
has
during
the
past
year
been
reduced
over
onehalf
an
appropriation
was
given
by
the
last
congress
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
experiments
in
free
delivery
in
the
smaller
cities
and
towns
the
results
of
these
experiments
have
been
so
satisfactory
that
the
postmastergeneral
recommends
and
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
that
the
freedelivery
system
be
at
once
extended
to
towns
of
population
his
discussion
of
the
inadequate
facilities
extended
under
our
present
system
to
rural
communities
and
his
suggestions
with
a
view
to
give
these
communities
a
fuller
participation
in
the
benefits
of
the
postal
service
are
worthy
of
your
careful
consideration
it
is
not
just
that
the
farmer
who
receives
his
mail
at
a
neighboring
town
should
not
only
be
compelled
to
send
to
the
postoffice
for
it
but
to
pay
a
considerable
rent
for
a
box
in
which
to
place
it
or
to
wait
his
turn
at
a
generaldelivery
window
while
the
city
resident
has
his
mail
brought
to
his
door
it
is
stated
that
over
neighborhoods
are
under
the
present
system
receiving
mail
at
postoffices
where
money
orders
and
postal
notes
are
not
issued
the
extension
of
this
system
to
these
communities
is
especially
desirable
as
the
patrons
of
such
offices
are
not
possessed
of
the
other
facilities
offered
in
more
populous
communities
for
the
transmission
of
small
sums
of
money
i
have
in
a
message
to
the
preceding
congress
expressed
my
views
as
to
a
modified
use
of
the
telegraph
in
connection
with
the
postal
service
in
pursuance
of
the
ocean
mail
law
of
march
and
after
a
most
careful
study
of
the
whole
subject
and
frequent
conferences
with
shipowners
boards
of
trade
and
others
advertisements
were
issued
by
the
postmastergeneral
for
lines
of
ocean
mail
service
to
great
britain
and
the
continent
to
south
america
to
china
and
japan
to
australia
and
the
pacific
islands
to
the
west
indies
and
to
mexico
it
was
not
of
course
expected
that
bids
for
all
these
lines
would
be
received
or
that
service
upon
them
all
would
be
contracted
for
it
was
intended
in
furtherance
of
the
act
to
secure
as
many
new
lines
as
possible
while
including
in
the
list
most
or
all
of
the
foreign
lines
now
occupied
by
american
ships
it
was
hoped
that
a
line
to
england
and
perhaps
one
to
the
continent
would
be
secured
but
the
outlay
required
to
equip
such
lines
wholly
with
new
ships
of
the
first
class
and
the
difficulty
of
establishing
new
lines
in
competition
with
those
already
established
deterred
bidders
whose
interest
had
been
enlisted
it
is
hoped
that
a
way
may
yet
be
found
of
overcoming
these
difficulties
the
brazil
steamship
company
by
reason
of
a
miscalculation
as
to
the
speed
of
its
vessels
was
not
able
to
bid
under
the
terms
of
the
advertisement
the
policy
of
the
department
was
to
secure
from
the
established
lines
an
improved
service
as
a
condition
of
giving
to
them
the
benefits
of
the
law
this
in
all
instances
has
been
attained
the
postmastergeneral
estimates
that
an
expenditure
in
american
shipyards
of
about
will
be
necessary
to
enable
the
bidders
to
construct
the
ships
called
for
by
the
service
which
they
have
accepted
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
reason
for
discouragement
or
for
any
turning
back
from
the
policy
of
this
legislation
indeed
a
good
beginning
has
been
made
and
as
the
subject
is
further
considered
and
understood
by
capitalists
and
shipping
people
new
lines
will
be
ready
to
meet
future
proposals
and
we
may
date
from
the
passage
of
this
law
the
revival
of
american
shipping
interests
and
the
recovery
of
a
fair
share
of
the
carrying
trade
of
the
world
we
were
receiving
for
foreign
postage
nearly
under
the
old
system
and
the
outlay
for
ocean
mail
service
did
not
exceed
per
annum
it
is
estimated
by
the
postmastergeneral
that
if
all
the
contracts
proposed
are
completed
it
will
require
for
this
year
in
addition
to
the
appropriation
for
sea
and
inland
postage
already
in
the
estimates
and
that
for
the
next
fiscal
year
ending
june
there
would
probably
be
needed
about
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
a
gratifying
increase
of
new
naval
vessels
in
commission
the
newark
concord
bennington
and
miantonomoh
have
been
added
during
the
year
with
an
aggregate
of
something
more
than
tons
twentyfour
warships
of
all
classes
are
now
under
construction
in
the
navyyards
and
private
shops
but
while
the
work
upon
them
is
going
forward
satisfactorily
the
completion
of
the
more
important
vessels
will
yet
require
about
a
years
time
some
of
the
vessels
now
under
construction
it
is
believed
will
be
triumphs
of
naval
engineering
when
it
is
recollected
that
the
work
of
building
a
modern
navy
was
only
initiated
in
the
year
that
our
naval
constructors
and
shipbuilders
were
practically
without
experience
in
the
construction
of
large
iron
or
steel
ships
that
our
engine
shops
were
unfamiliar
with
great
marine
engines
and
that
the
manufacture
of
steel
forgings
for
guns
and
plates
was
almost
wholly
a
foreign
industry
the
progress
that
has
been
made
is
not
only
highly
satisfactory
but
furnishes
the
assurance
that
the
united
states
will
before
long
attain
in
the
construction
of
such
vessels
with
their
engines
and
armaments
the
same
preeminence
which
it
attained
when
the
best
instrument
of
ocean
commerce
was
the
clipper
ship
and
the
most
impressive
exhibit
of
naval
power
the
old
wooden
threedecker
manofwar
the
officers
of
the
navy
and
the
proprietors
and
engineers
of
our
great
private
shops
have
responded
with
wonderful
intelligence
and
p
rofessional
zeal
to
the
confidence
expressed
by
congress
in
its
liberal
legislation
we
have
now
at
washington
a
gun
shop
organized
and
conducted
by
naval
officers
that
in
its
system
economy
and
product
is
unexcelled
experiments
with
armor
plate
have
been
conducted
during
the
year
with
most
important
results
it
is
now
believed
that
a
plate
of
higher
resisting
power
than
any
in
use
has
been
found
and
that
the
tests
have
demonstrated
that
cheaper
methods
of
manufacture
than
those
heretofore
thought
necessary
can
be
used
i
commend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
who
has
i
am
sure
given
to
them
the
most
conscientious
study
there
should
be
no
hesitation
in
promptly
completing
a
navy
of
the
best
modern
type
large
enough
to
enable
this
country
to
display
its
flag
in
all
seas
for
the
protection
of
its
citizens
and
of
its
extending
commerce
the
world
needs
no
assurance
of
the
peaceful
purposes
of
the
united
states
but
we
shall
probably
be
in
the
future
more
largely
a
competitor
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
and
it
is
essential
to
the
dignity
of
this
nation
and
to
that
peaceful
influence
which
it
should
exercise
on
this
hemisphere
that
its
navy
should
be
adequate
both
upon
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
of
the
pacific
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shows
that
a
very
gratifying
progress
has
been
made
in
all
of
the
bureaus
which
make
up
that
complex
and
difficult
department
the
work
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was
perhaps
never
so
large
as
now
by
reason
of
the
numerous
negotiations
which
have
been
proceeding
with
the
tribes
for
a
reduction
of
the
reservations
with
the
incident
labor
of
making
allotments
and
was
never
more
carefully
conducted
the
provision
of
adequate
school
facilities
for
indian
children
and
the
locating
of
adult
indians
upon
farms
involve
the
solution
of
the
indian
question
everything
elserations
annuities
and
tribal
negotiations
with
the
agents
inspectors
and
commissioners
who
distribute
and
conduct
themmust
pass
away
when
the
indian
has
become
a
citizen
secure
in
the
individual
ownership
of
a
farm
from
which
he
derives
his
subsistence
by
his
own
labor
protected
by
and
subordinate
to
the
laws
which
govern
the
white
man
and
provided
by
the
general
government
or
by
the
local
communities
in
which
he
lives
with
the
means
of
educating
his
children
when
an
indian
becomes
a
citizen
in
an
organized
state
or
territory
his
relation
to
the
general
government
ceases
in
great
measure
to
be
that
of
a
ward
but
the
general
government
ought
not
at
once
to
put
upon
the
state
or
territory
the
burden
of
the
education
of
his
children
it
has
been
my
thought
that
the
government
schools
and
school
buildings
upon
the
reservations
would
be
absorbed
by
the
school
systems
of
the
states
and
territories
but
as
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
protect
the
indian
against
the
compulsory
alienation
of
his
land
by
exempting
him
from
taxation
for
a
period
of
twentyfive
years
it
would
seem
to
be
right
that
the
general
government
certainly
where
there
are
tribal
funds
in
its
possession
should
pay
to
the
school
fund
of
the
state
what
would
be
equivalent
to
the
local
school
tax
upon
the
property
of
the
indian
it
will
be
noticed
from
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
that
already
some
contracts
have
been
made
with
district
schools
for
the
education
of
indian
children
there
is
great
advantage
i
think
in
bringing
the
indian
children
into
mixed
schools
this
process
will
be
gradual
and
in
the
meantime
the
present
educational
provisions
and
arrangements
the
result
of
the
best
experience
of
those
who
have
been
charged
with
this
work
should
be
continued
this
will
enable
those
religious
bodies
that
have
undertaken
the
work
of
indian
education
with
so
much
zeal
and
with
results
so
restraining
and
beneficent
to
place
their
institutions
in
new
and
useful
relations
to
the
indian
and
to
his
white
neighbors
the
outbreak
among
the
sioux
which
occurred
in
december
last
is
as
to
its
causes
and
incidents
fully
reported
upon
by
the
war
department
and
the
department
of
the
interior
that
these
indians
had
some
just
complaints
especially
in
the
matter
of
the
reduction
of
the
appropriation
for
rations
and
in
the
delays
attending
the
enactment
of
laws
to
enable
the
department
to
perform
the
engagements
entered
into
with
them
is
probably
true
but
the
sioux
tribes
are
naturally
warlike
and
turbulent
and
their
warriors
were
excited
by
their
medicine
men
and
chiefs
who
preached
the
coming
of
an
indian
messiah
who
was
to
give
them
power
to
destroy
their
enemies
in
view
of
the
alarm
that
prevailed
among
the
white
settlers
near
the
reservation
and
of
the
fatal
consequences
that
would
have
resulted
from
an
indian
incursion
i
placed
at
the
disposal
of
general
miles
commanding
the
division
of
the
missouri
all
such
forces
as
were
thought
by
him
to
be
required
he
is
entitled
to
the
credit
of
having
given
thorough
protection
to
the
settlers
and
of
bringing
the
hostiles
into
subjection
with
the
least
possible
loss
of
life
the
appropriation
of
for
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
contained
in
the
general
indian
appropriation
bill
of
march
has
not
been
expended
for
the
reason
that
i
have
not
yet
approved
a
release
to
the
government
of
the
indian
claim
to
the
lands
mentioned
this
matter
will
be
made
the
subject
of
a
special
message
placing
before
congress
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
my
knowledge
the
relation
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
now
occupying
the
indian
territory
to
the
united
states
is
not
i
believe
that
best
calculated
to
promote
the
highest
advancement
of
these
indians
that
there
should
be
within
our
borders
five
independent
states
having
no
relations
except
those
growing
out
of
treaties
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
no
representation
in
the
national
legislature
its
people
not
citizens
is
a
startling
anomaly
it
seems
to
me
to
be
inevitable
that
there
shall
be
before
long
some
organic
changes
in
the
relation
of
these
people
to
the
united
states
what
form
these
changes
should
take
i
do
not
think
it
desirable
now
to
suggest
even
if
they
were
well
defined
in
my
own
mind
they
should
certainly
involve
the
acceptance
of
citizenship
by
the
indians
and
a
representation
in
congress
these
indians
should
have
opportunity
to
present
their
claims
and
grievances
upon
the
floor
rather
than
as
now
in
the
lobby
if
a
commission
could
be
appointed
to
visit
these
tribes
to
confer
with
them
in
a
friendly
spirit
upon
this
whole
subject
even
if
no
agreement
were
presently
reached
the
feeling
of
the
tribes
upon
this
question
would
be
developed
and
discussion
would
prepare
the
way
for
changes
which
must
come
sooner
or
later
the
good
work
of
reducing
the
larger
indian
reservations
by
allotments
in
severalty
to
the
indians
and
the
cession
of
the
remaining
lands
to
the
united
states
for
disposition
under
the
homestead
law
has
been
prosecuted
during
the
year
with
energy
and
success
in
september
last
i
was
enabled
to
open
to
settlement
in
the
territory
of
oklahoma
acres
of
land
all
of
which
was
taken
up
by
settlers
in
a
single
day
the
rush
for
these
lands
was
accompanied
by
a
great
deal
of
excitement
but
was
happily
free
from
incidents
of
violence
it
was
a
source
of
great
regret
that
i
was
not
able
to
open
at
the
same
time
the
surplus
lands
of
the
cheyenne
and
arapahoe
reservation
amounting
to
about
acres
by
reason
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
appropriation
for
making
the
allotments
deserving
and
impatient
settlers
are
waiting
to
occupy
these
lands
and
i
urgently
recommend
that
a
special
deficiency
appropriation
be
promptly
made
of
the
small
amount
needed
so
that
the
allotments
may
be
completed
and
the
surplus
lands
opened
in
time
to
permit
the
settlers
to
get
upon
their
homesteads
in
the
early
spring
during
the
past
summer
the
cherokee
commission
have
completed
arrangements
with
the
wichita
kickapoo
and
tonkawa
tribes
whereby
if
the
agreements
are
ratified
by
congress
over
additional
acres
will
be
opened
to
settlement
in
oklahoma
the
negotiations
for
the
release
by
the
cherokees
of
their
claim
to
the
cherokee
strip
have
made
no
substantial
progress
so
far
as
the
department
is
officially
advised
but
it
is
still
hoped
that
the
cession
of
this
large
and
valuable
tract
may
be
secured
the
price
which
the
commission
was
authorized
to
offer
per
acreis
in
my
judgment
when
all
the
circumstances
as
to
title
and
the
character
of
the
lands
are
considered
a
fair
and
adequate
one
and
should
have
been
accepted
by
the
indians
since
march
about
acres
have
been
separated
from
indian
reservations
and
added
to
the
public
domain
for
the
use
of
those
who
desired
to
secure
free
homes
under
our
beneficent
laws
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
increase
of
wealth
which
will
result
from
the
conversion
of
these
waste
lands
into
farms
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
estimate
the
betterment
which
will
result
to
the
families
that
have
found
renewed
hope
and
courage
in
the
ownership
of
a
home
and
the
assurance
of
a
comfortable
subsistence
under
free
and
healthful
conditions
it
is
also
gratifying
to
be
able
to
feel
as
we
may
that
this
work
has
proceeded
upon
lines
of
justice
toward
the
indian
and
that
he
may
now
if
he
will
secure
to
himself
the
good
influences
of
a
settled
habitation
the
fruits
of
industry
and
the
security
of
citizenship
early
in
this
administration
a
special
effort
was
begun
to
bring
up
the
work
of
the
general
land
office
by
faithful
work
the
arrearages
have
been
rapidly
reduced
at
the
end
of
the
last
fiscal
year
only
final
agricultural
entries
remained
undisposed
of
and
the
commissioner
reports
that
with
the
present
force
the
work
can
be
fully
brought
up
by
the
end
of
the
next
fiscal
year
your
attention
is
called
to
the
difficulty
presented
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
as
to
the
administration
of
the
law
of
march
establishing
a
court
of
private
land
claims
the
small
holdings
intended
to
be
protected
by
the
law
are
estimated
to
be
more
than
in
number
the
claimants
are
a
most
deserving
class
and
their
titles
are
supported
by
the
strongest
equi
ties
the
difficulty
grows
out
of
the
fact
that
the
lands
have
largely
been
surveyed
according
to
our
methods
while
the
holdings
many
of
which
have
been
in
the
same
family
for
generations
are
laid
out
in
narrow
strips
a
few
rods
wide
upon
a
stream
and
running
back
to
the
hills
for
pasturage
and
timber
provision
should
be
made
for
numbering
these
tracts
as
lots
and
for
patenting
them
by
such
numbers
and
without
reference
to
section
lines
the
administration
of
the
pension
bureau
has
been
characterized
during
the
year
by
great
diligence
the
total
number
of
pensioners
upon
the
roll
on
the
th
day
of
june
was
there
were
allowed
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
at
that
time
cases
of
this
number
were
allowed
under
the
law
of
june
the
issuing
of
certificates
has
been
proceeding
at
the
rate
of
about
per
month
about
per
cent
of
these
being
cases
under
the
new
law
the
commissioner
expresses
the
opinion
that
he
will
be
able
to
carefully
adjudicate
and
allow
claims
during
the
present
fiscal
year
the
appropriation
for
the
payment
of
pensions
for
the
fiscal
year
was
and
the
amount
expended
leaving
an
unexpended
surplus
of
the
commissioner
is
quite
confident
that
there
will
be
no
call
this
year
for
a
deficiency
appropriation
notwithstanding
the
rapidity
with
which
the
work
is
being
pushed
the
mistake
which
has
been
made
by
many
in
their
exaggerated
estimates
of
the
cost
of
pensions
is
in
not
taking
account
of
the
diminished
value
of
first
payments
under
the
recent
legislation
these
payments
under
the
general
law
have
been
for
many
years
very
large
as
the
pensions
when
allowed
dated
from
the
time
of
filing
the
claim
and
most
of
these
claims
had
been
pending
for
years
the
first
payments
under
the
law
of
june
are
relatively
small
and
as
the
per
cent
of
these
cases
increases
and
that
of
the
old
cases
diminishes
the
annual
aggregate
of
first
payments
is
largely
reduced
the
commissioner
under
date
of
november
furnishes
me
with
the
statement
that
during
the
last
four
months
certificates
were
issued
under
the
general
law
and
under
the
act
of
june
the
average
first
payment
during
these
four
months
was
while
the
average
first
payment
upon
cases
allowed
during
the
year
ending
june
was
being
a
reduction
in
the
average
first
payments
during
these
four
months
of
the
estimate
for
pension
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
is
which
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
subject
the
commissioner
is
of
the
opinion
will
be
sufficient
while
these
disbursements
to
the
disabled
soldiers
of
the
great
civil
war
are
large
they
do
not
realize
the
exaggerated
estimates
of
those
who
oppose
this
beneficent
legislation
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shows
with
great
fullness
the
care
that
is
taken
to
exclude
fraudulent
claims
and
also
the
gratifying
fact
that
the
persons
to
whom
these
pensions
are
going
are
men
who
rendered
not
slight
but
substantial
war
service
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
railroads
shows
that
the
total
debt
of
the
subsidized
railroads
to
the
united
states
was
on
december
a
large
part
of
this
debt
is
now
fast
approaching
maturity
with
no
adequate
provision
for
its
payment
some
policy
for
dealing
with
this
debt
with
a
view
to
its
ultimate
collection
should
be
at
once
adopted
it
is
very
difficult
wellnigh
impossible
for
so
large
a
body
as
the
congress
to
conduct
the
necessary
negotiations
and
investigations
i
therefore
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
agree
upon
and
report
a
plan
for
dealing
with
this
debt
the
work
of
the
census
bureau
is
now
far
in
advance
and
the
great
bulk
of
the
enormous
labor
involved
completed
it
will
be
more
strictly
a
statistical
exhibit
and
less
encumbered
by
essays
than
its
immediate
predecessors
the
methods
pursued
have
been
fair
careful
and
intelligent
and
have
secured
the
approval
of
the
statisticians
who
have
followed
them
with
a
scientific
and
nonpartisan
interest
the
appropriations
necessary
to
the
early
completion
and
publication
of
the
authorized
volumes
should
be
given
in
time
to
secure
against
delays
which
increase
the
cost
and
at
the
same
time
diminish
the
value
of
the
work
the
report
of
the
secretary
exhibits
with
interesting
fullness
the
condition
of
the
territories
they
have
shared
with
the
states
the
great
increase
in
farm
products
and
are
bringing
yearly
large
areas
into
cultivation
by
extending
their
irrigating
canals
this
work
is
being
done
by
individuals
or
local
corporations
and
without
that
system
which
a
full
preliminary
survey
of
the
water
supply
and
of
the
irrigable
lands
would
enable
them
to
adopt
the
future
of
the
territories
of
new
mexico
arizona
and
utah
in
their
material
growth
and
in
the
increase
independence
and
happiness
of
their
people
is
very
largely
dependent
upon
wise
and
timely
legislation
either
by
congress
or
their
own
legislatures
regulating
the
distribution
of
the
water
supply
furnished
by
their
streams
if
this
matter
is
much
longer
neglected
private
corporations
will
have
unrestricted
control
of
one
of
the
elements
of
life
and
the
patentees
of
the
arid
lands
will
be
tenants
at
will
of
the
water
companies
the
united
states
should
part
with
its
ownership
of
the
water
sources
and
the
sites
for
reservoirs
whether
to
the
states
and
territories
or
to
individuals
or
corporations
only
upon
conditions
that
will
insure
to
the
settlers
their
proper
water
supply
upon
equal
and
reasonable
terms
in
the
territories
this
whole
subject
is
under
the
full
control
of
congress
and
in
the
states
it
is
practically
so
as
long
as
the
government
holds
the
title
to
the
reservoir
sites
and
water
sources
and
can
grant
them
upon
such
conditions
as
it
chooses
to
impose
the
improvident
granting
of
franchises
of
enormous
value
without
recompense
to
the
state
or
municipality
from
which
they
proceed
and
without
proper
protection
of
the
public
interests
is
the
most
noticeable
and
flagrant
evil
of
modern
legislation
this
fault
should
not
be
committed
in
dealing
with
a
subject
that
will
before
many
years
affect
so
vitally
thousands
of
our
people
the
legislation
of
congress
for
the
repression
of
polygamy
has
after
years
of
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
mormons
at
last
brought
them
to
the
conclusion
that
resistance
is
unprofitable
and
unavailing
the
power
of
congress
over
this
subject
should
not
be
surrendered
until
we
have
satisfactory
evidence
that
the
people
of
the
state
to
be
created
would
exercise
the
exclusive
power
of
the
state
over
this
subject
in
the
same
way
the
question
is
not
whether
these
people
now
obey
the
laws
of
congress
against
polygamy
but
rather
would
they
make
enforce
and
maintain
such
laws
themselves
if
absolutely
free
to
regulate
the
subject
we
can
not
afford
to
experiment
with
this
subject
for
when
a
state
is
once
constituted
the
act
is
final
and
any
mistake
irretrievable
no
compact
in
the
enabling
act
could
in
my
opinion
be
binding
or
effective
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
the
organization
of
a
simple
form
of
town
government
in
alaska
with
power
to
regulate
such
matters
as
are
usually
in
the
states
under
municipal
control
these
local
civil
organizations
will
give
better
protection
in
some
matters
than
the
present
skeleton
territorial
organization
proper
restrictions
as
to
the
power
to
levy
taxes
and
to
create
debt
should
be
imposed
if
the
establishment
of
the
department
of
agriculture
was
regarded
by
anyone
as
a
mere
concession
to
the
unenlightened
demand
of
a
worthy
class
of
people
that
impression
has
been
most
effectually
removed
by
the
great
results
already
attained
its
home
influence
has
been
very
great
in
disseminating
agricultural
and
horticultural
information
in
stimulating
and
directing
a
further
diversification
of
crops
in
detecting
and
eradicating
diseases
of
domestic
animals
and
more
than
all
in
the
close
and
informal
contact
which
it
has
established
and
maintains
with
the
farmers
and
stock
raisers
of
the
whole
country
every
request
for
information
has
had
prompt
attention
and
every
suggestion
merited
consideration
the
scientific
corps
of
the
department
is
of
a
high
order
and
is
pushing
its
investigations
with
method
and
enthusiasm
the
inspection
by
this
department
of
cattle
and
pork
products
intended
for
shipment
abroad
has
been
the
basis
of
the
success
which
has
attended
our
efforts
to
secure
the
removal
of
the
restrictions
maintained
by
the
european
governments
for
ten
years
protests
and
petitions
upon
this
subject
from
the
packers
and
stock
raisers
of
the
united
states
have
been
directed
against
these
restrictions
which
so
seriously
limited
our
markets
and
curtailed
the
profits
of
the
farm
it
is
a
source
of
general
congratulation
that
success
has
at
last
been
attained
for
the
effects
of
an
enlarged
foreign
market
for
these
meats
will
be
felt
not
only
by
the
farmer
but
in
our
public
finances
and
in
every
branch
of
trade
it
is
particularly
fortunate
that
the
increased
demand
for
food
products
resulting
from
the
removal
of
the
restrictions
upon
our
meats
and
from
the
reciprocal
trade
arrangements
to
which
i
have
referred
should
have
come
at
a
time
when
the
agricultural
surplus
is
so
large
without
the
help
thus
derived
lower
prices
would
have
prevailed
the
secretary
of
agriculture
estimates
that
the
restrictions
upon
the
importation
of
our
pork
products
into
europe
lost
us
a
market
for
worth
of
these
products
annually
the
grain
crop
of
this
year
was
the
largest
in
our
history
per
cent
greater
than
that
of
last
yearand
yet
the
new
markets
that
have
been
opened
and
the
larger
demand
resulting
from
short
crops
in
europe
have
sustained
prices
to
such
an
extent
that
the
enormous
surplus
of
meats
and
breadstuffs
will
be
marketed
at
good
prices
bringing
relief
and
prosperity
to
an
industry
that
was
much
depressed
the
value
of
the
grain
crop
of
the
united
states
is
estimated
by
the
secretary
to
be
this
year
more
than
last
of
meats
more
and
of
all
products
of
the
farm
more
it
is
not
inappropriate
i
think
here
to
suggest
that
our
satisfaction
in
the
contemplation
of
this
marvelous
addition
to
the
national
wealth
is
unclouded
by
an
y
suspicion
of
the
currency
by
which
it
is
measured
and
in
which
the
farmer
is
paid
for
the
products
of
his
fields
the
report
of
the
civil
service
commission
should
receive
the
careful
attention
of
the
opponents
as
well
as
the
friends
of
this
reform
the
commission
invites
a
personal
inspection
by
senators
and
representatives
of
its
records
and
methods
and
every
fair
critic
will
feel
that
such
an
examination
should
precede
a
judgment
of
condemnation
either
of
the
system
or
its
administration
it
is
not
claimed
that
either
is
perfect
but
i
believe
that
the
law
is
being
executed
with
impartiality
and
that
the
system
is
incomparably
better
and
fairer
than
that
of
appointments
upon
favor
i
have
during
the
year
extended
the
classified
service
to
include
superintendents
teachers
matrons
and
physicians
in
the
indian
service
this
branch
of
the
service
is
largely
related
to
educational
and
philanthropic
work
and
will
obviously
be
the
better
for
the
change
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
have
been
directed
to
establish
at
once
an
efficiency
record
as
the
basis
of
a
comparative
rating
of
the
clerks
within
the
classified
service
with
a
view
to
placing
promotions
therein
upon
the
basis
of
merit
i
am
confident
that
such
a
record
fairly
kept
and
open
to
the
inspection
of
those
interested
will
powerfully
stimulate
the
work
of
the
departments
and
will
be
accepted
by
all
as
placing
the
troublesome
matter
of
promotions
upon
a
just
basis
i
recommend
that
the
appropriation
for
the
civil
service
commission
be
made
adequate
to
the
increased
work
of
the
next
fiscal
year
i
have
twice
before
urgently
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
necessity
of
legislation
for
the
protection
of
the
lives
of
railroad
employees
but
nothing
has
yet
been
done
during
the
year
ending
june
brakemen
were
killed
and
maimed
while
engaged
in
coupling
cars
the
total
number
of
railroad
employees
killed
during
the
year
was
and
the
number
injured
this
is
a
cruel
and
largely
needless
sacrifice
the
government
is
spending
nearly
annually
to
save
the
lives
of
shipwrecked
seamen
every
steam
vessel
is
rigidly
inspected
and
required
to
adopt
the
most
approved
safety
appliances
all
this
is
good
but
how
shall
we
excuse
the
lack
of
interest
and
effort
in
behalf
of
this
army
of
brave
young
men
who
in
our
land
commerce
are
being
sacrificed
every
year
by
the
continued
use
of
antiquated
and
dangerous
appliances
a
law
requiring
of
every
railroad
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
the
equipment
each
year
of
a
given
per
cent
of
its
freight
cars
with
automatic
couplers
and
air
brakes
would
compel
an
agreement
between
the
roads
as
to
the
kind
of
brakes
and
couplers
to
be
used
and
would
very
soon
and
very
greatly
reduce
the
present
fearful
death
rate
among
railroad
employees
the
method
of
appointment
by
the
states
of
electors
of
president
and
vicepresident
has
recently
attracted
renewed
interest
by
reason
of
a
departure
by
the
state
of
michigan
from
the
method
which
had
become
uniform
in
all
the
states
prior
to
various
methods
had
been
used
by
the
different
states
and
even
by
the
same
state
in
some
the
choice
was
made
by
the
legislature
in
others
electors
were
chosen
by
districts
but
more
generally
by
the
voters
of
the
whole
state
upon
a
general
ticket
the
movement
toward
the
adoption
of
the
lastnamed
method
had
an
early
beginning
and
went
steadily
forward
among
the
states
until
in
there
remained
but
a
single
state
south
carolina
that
had
not
adopted
it
that
state
until
the
civil
war
continued
to
choose
its
electors
by
a
vote
of
the
legislature
but
after
the
war
changed
its
method
and
conformed
to
the
practice
of
the
other
states
for
nearly
sixty
years
all
the
states
save
one
have
appointed
their
electors
by
a
popular
vote
upon
a
general
ticket
and
for
nearly
thirty
years
this
method
was
universal
after
a
full
test
of
other
methods
without
important
division
or
dissent
in
any
state
and
without
any
purpose
of
party
advantage
as
we
must
believe
but
solely
upon
the
considerations
that
uniformity
was
desirable
and
that
a
general
election
in
territorial
divisions
not
subject
to
change
was
most
consistent
with
the
popular
character
of
our
institutions
best
preserved
the
equality
of
the
voters
and
perfectly
removed
the
choice
of
president
from
the
baneful
influence
of
the
gerrymander
the
practice
of
all
the
states
was
brought
into
harmony
that
this
concurrence
should
now
be
broken
is
i
think
an
unfortunate
and
even
a
threatening
episode
and
one
that
may
well
suggest
whether
the
states
that
still
give
their
approval
to
the
old
and
prevailing
method
ought
not
to
secure
by
a
constitutional
amendment
a
practice
which
has
had
the
approval
of
all
the
recent
michigan
legislation
provides
for
choosing
what
are
popularly
known
as
the
congressional
electors
for
president
by
congressional
districts
and
the
two
senatorial
electors
by
districts
created
for
that
purpose
this
legislation
was
of
course
accompanied
by
a
new
congressional
apportionment
and
the
two
statutes
bring
the
electoral
vote
of
the
state
under
the
influence
of
the
gerrymander
these
gerrymanders
for
congressional
purposes
are
in
most
cases
buttressed
by
a
gerrymander
of
the
legislative
districts
thus
making
it
impossible
for
a
majority
of
the
legal
voters
of
the
state
to
correct
the
apportionment
and
equalize
the
congressional
districts
a
minority
rule
is
established
that
only
a
political
convulsion
can
overthrow
i
have
recently
been
advised
that
in
one
county
of
a
certain
state
three
districts
for
the
election
of
members
of
the
legislature
are
constituted
as
follows
one
has
population
one
and
one
while
in
another
county
detached
noncontiguous
sections
have
been
united
to
make
a
legislative
district
these
methods
have
already
found
effective
application
to
the
choice
of
senators
and
representatives
in
congress
and
now
an
evil
start
has
been
made
in
the
direction
of
applying
them
to
the
choice
by
the
states
of
electors
of
president
and
vicepresident
if
this
is
accomplished
we
shall
then
have
the
three
great
departments
of
the
government
in
the
grasp
of
the
gerrymander
the
legislative
and
executive
directly
and
the
judiciary
indirectly
through
the
power
of
appointment
an
election
implies
a
body
of
electors
having
prescribed
qualifications
each
one
of
whom
has
an
equal
value
and
influence
in
determining
the
result
so
when
the
constitution
provides
that
each
state
shall
appoint
elect
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof
may
direct
a
number
of
electors
etc
an
unrestricted
power
was
not
given
to
the
legislatures
in
the
selection
of
the
methods
to
be
used
a
republican
form
of
government
is
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
to
each
state
and
the
power
given
by
the
same
instrument
to
the
legislatures
of
the
states
to
prescribe
methods
for
the
choice
by
the
state
of
electors
must
be
exercised
under
that
limitation
the
essential
features
of
such
a
government
are
the
right
of
the
people
to
choose
their
own
officers
and
the
nearest
practicable
equality
of
value
in
the
suffrages
given
in
determining
that
choice
it
will
not
be
claimed
that
the
power
given
to
the
legislature
would
support
a
law
providing
that
the
persons
receiving
the
smallest
vote
should
be
the
electors
or
a
law
that
all
the
electors
should
be
chosen
by
the
voters
of
a
single
congressional
district
the
state
is
to
choose
and
finder
the
pretense
of
regulating
methods
the
legislature
can
neither
vest
the
right
of
choice
elsewhere
nor
adopt
methods
not
conformable
to
republican
institutions
it
is
not
my
purpose
here
to
discuss
the
question
whether
a
choice
by
the
legislature
or
by
the
voters
of
equal
single
districts
is
a
choice
by
the
state
but
only
to
recommend
such
regulation
of
this
matter
by
constitutional
amendment
as
will
secure
uniformity
and
prevent
that
disgraceful
partisan
jugglery
to
which
such
a
liberty
of
choice
if
it
exists
offers
a
temptation
nothing
just
now
is
more
important
than
to
provide
every
guaranty
for
the
absolutely
fair
and
free
choice
by
an
equal
suffrage
within
the
respective
states
of
all
the
officers
of
the
national
government
whether
that
suffrage
is
applied
directly
as
in
the
choice
of
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
or
indirectly
as
in
the
choice
of
senators
and
electors
of
president
respect
for
public
officers
and
obedience
to
law
will
not
cease
to
be
the
characteristics
of
our
people
until
our
elections
cease
to
declare
the
will
of
majorities
fairly
ascertained
without
fraud
suppression
or
gerrymander
if
i
were
called
upon
to
declare
wherein
our
chief
national
danger
lies
i
should
say
without
hesitation
in
the
overthrow
of
majority
control
by
the
suppression
or
perversion
of
the
popular
suffrage
that
there
is
a
real
danger
here
all
must
agree
but
the
energies
of
those
who
see
it
have
been
chiefly
expended
in
trying
to
fix
responsibility
upon
the
opposite
party
rather
than
in
efforts
to
make
such
practices
impossible
by
either
party
is
it
not
possible
now
to
adjourn
that
interminable
and
inconclusive
debate
while
we
take
by
consent
one
step
in
the
direction
of
reform
by
eliminating
the
gerrymander
which
has
been
denounced
by
all
parties
as
an
influence
in
the
selection
of
electors
of
president
and
members
of
congress
all
the
states
have
acting
freely
and
separately
determined
that
the
choice
of
electors
by
a
general
ticket
is
the
wisest
and
safest
method
and
it
would
seem
there
could
be
no
objection
to
a
constitutional
amendment
making
that
method
permanent
if
a
legislature
chosen
in
one
year
upon
purely
local
questions
should
pending
a
presidential
contest
meet
rescind
the
law
for
a
choice
upon
a
general
ticket
and
provide
for
the
choice
of
electors
by
the
legislature
and
this
trick
should
determine
the
result
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
public
peace
might
be
seriously
and
widely
endangered
i
have
alluded
to
the
gerrymander
as
affecting
the
method
of
selecting
electors
of
president
by
congressional
districts
but
the
primary
intent
and
effect
of
this
form
of
political
robbery
have
relation
to
the
selection
of
members
of

the
house
of
representatives
the
power
of
congress
is
ample
to
deal
with
this
threatening
and
intolerable
abuse
the
unfailing
test
of
sincerity
in
election
reform
will
be
found
in
a
willingness
to
confer
as
to
remedies
and
to
put
into
force
such
measures
as
will
most
effectually
preserve
the
right
of
the
people
to
free
and
equal
representation
an
attempt
was
made
in
the
last
congress
to
bring
to
bear
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
general
government
for
the
correction
of
fraud
against
the
suffrage
it
is
important
to
know
whether
the
opposition
to
such
measures
is
really
rested
in
particular
features
supposed
to
be
objectionable
or
includes
any
proposition
to
give
to
the
election
laws
of
the
united
states
adequacy
to
the
correction
of
grave
and
acknowledged
evils
i
must
yet
entertain
the
hope
that
it
is
possible
to
secure
a
calm
patriotic
consideration
of
such
constitutional
or
statutory
changes
as
may
be
necessary
to
secure
the
choice
of
the
officers
of
the
government
to
the
people
by
fair
apportionments
and
free
elections
i
believe
it
would
be
possible
to
constitute
a
commission
nonpartisan
in
its
membership
and
composed
of
patriotic
wise
and
impartial
men
to
whom
a
consideration
of
the
question
of
the
evils
connected
with
our
election
system
and
methods
might
be
committed
with
a
good
prospect
of
securing
unanimity
in
some
plan
for
removing
or
mitigating
those
evils
the
constitution
would
permit
the
selection
of
the
commission
to
be
vested
in
the
supreme
court
if
that
method
would
give
the
best
guaranty
of
impartiality
this
commission
should
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
inquiring
into
the
whole
subject
of
the
law
of
elections
as
related
to
the
choice
of
officers
of
the
national
government
with
a
view
to
securing
to
every
elector
a
free
and
unmolested
exercise
of
the
suffrage
and
as
near
an
approach
to
an
equality
of
value
in
each
ballot
cast
as
is
attainable
while
the
policies
of
the
general
government
upon
the
tariff
upon
the
restoration
of
our
merchant
marine
upon
river
and
harbor
improvements
and
other
such
matters
of
grave
and
general
concern
are
liable
to
be
turned
this
way
or
that
by
the
results
of
congressional
elections
and
administrative
policies
sometimes
involving
issues
that
tend
to
peace
or
war
to
be
turned
this
way
or
that
by
the
results
of
a
presidential
election
there
is
a
rightful
interest
in
all
the
states
and
in
every
congressional
district
that
will
not
be
deceived
or
silenced
by
the
audacious
pretense
that
the
question
of
the
right
of
any
body
of
legal
voters
in
any
state
or
in
any
congressional
district
to
give
their
suffrages
freely
upon
these
general
questions
is
a
matter
only
of
local
concern
or
control
the
demand
that
the
limitations
of
suffrage
shall
be
found
in
the
law
and
only
there
is
a
just
demand
and
no
just
man
should
resent
or
resist
it
my
appeal
is
and
must
continue
to
be
for
a
consultation
that
shall
proceed
with
candor
calmness
and
patience
upon
the
lines
of
justice
and
humanity
not
of
prejudice
and
cruelty
to
the
consideration
of
these
very
grave
questions
i
invite
not
only
the
attention
of
congress
but
that
of
all
patriotic
citizens
we
must
not
entertain
the
delusion
that
our
people
have
ceased
to
regard
a
free
ballot
and
equal
representation
as
the
price
of
their
allegiance
to
laws
and
to
civil
magistrates
i
have
been
greatly
rejoiced
to
notice
many
evidences
of
the
increased
unification
of
our
people
and
of
a
revived
national
spirit
the
vista
that
now
opens
to
us
is
wider
and
more
glorious
than
ever
before
gratification
and
amazement
struggle
for
supremacy
as
we
contemplate
the
population
wealth
and
moral
strength
of
our
country
a
trust
momentous
in
its
influence
upon
our
people
and
upon
the
world
is
for
a
brief
time
committed
to
us
and
we
must
not
be
faithless
to
its
first
conditionthe
defense
of
the
free
and
equal
influence
of
the
people

the
choice
of
public

in
the
control
of
public
affairs
benj

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
reports
of
the
several
executive
departments
which
will
be
laid
before
congress
in
the
usual
course
will
exhibit
in
detail
the
operations
of
the
government
for
the
last
fiscal
year
only
the
more
important
incidents
and
results
and
chiefly
such
as
may
be
the
foundation
of
the
recommendations
i
shall
submit
will
be
referred
to
in
this
annual
message
the
vast
and
increasing
business
of
the
government
has
been
transacted
by
the
several
departments
during
the
year
with
faithfulness
energy
and
success
the
revenues
amounting
to
above
have
been
collected
and
disbursed
without
revealing
so
far
as
i
can
ascertain
a
single
case
of
defalcation
or
embezzlement
an
earnest
effort
has
been
made
to
stimulate
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
public
duty
in
all
officers
and
employees
of
every
grade
and
the
work
done
by
them
has
almost
wholly
escaped
unfavorable
criticism
i
speak
of
these
matters
with
freedom
because
the
credit
of
this
good
work
is
not
mine
but
is
shared
by
the
heads
of
the
several
departments
with
the
great
body
of
faithful
officers
and
employees
who
serve
under
them
the
closest
scrutiny
of
congress
is
invited
to
all
the
methods
of
administration
and
to
every
item
of
expenditure
the
friendly
relations
of
our
country
with
the
nations
of
europe
and
of
the
east
have
been
undisturbed
while
the
ties
of
good
will
and
common
interest
that
bind
us
to
the
states
of
the
western
hemisphere
have
been
notably
strengthened
by
the
conference
held
in
this
capital
to
consider
measures
for
the
general
welfare
pursuant
to
the
invitation
authorized
by
congress
the
representatives
of
every
independent
state
of
the
american
continent
and
of
hayti
met
in
conference
in
this
capital
in
october
and
continued
in
session
until
the
th
of
last
april
this
important
convocation
marks
a
most
interesting
and
influential
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
western
hemisphere
it
is
noteworthy
that
brazil
invited
while
under
an
imperial
form
of
government
shared
as
a
republic
in
the
deliberations
and
results
of
the
conference
the
recommendations
of
this
conference
were
all
transmitted
to
congress
at
the
last
session
the
international
marine
conference
which
sat
at
washington
last
winter
reached
a
very
gratifying
result
the
regulations
suggested
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
all
the
governments
represented
and
their
general
adoption
is
confidently
expected
the
legislation
of
congress
at
the
last
session
is
in
conformity
with
the
propositions
of
the
conference
and
the
proclamation
therein
provided
for
will
be
issued
when
the
other
powers
have
given
notice
of
their
adhesion
the
conference
of
brussels
to
devise
means
for
suppressing
the
slave
trade
in
africa
afforded
an
opportunity
for
a
new
expression
of
the
interest
the
american
people
feel
in
that
great
work
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
measure
proposed
would
tax
the
resources
of
the
kongo
basin
beyond
the
revenues
available
under
the
general
act
of
berlin
of
the
united
states
not
being
a
party
to
that
act
could
not
share
in
its
revision
but
by
a
separate
act
the
independent
state
of
the
kongo
was
freed
from
the
restrictions
upon
a
customs
revenue
the
demoralizing
and
destructive
traffic
in
ardent
spirits
among
the
tribes
also
claimed
the
earnest
attention
of
the
conference
and
the
delegates
of
the
united
states
were
foremost
in
advocating
measures
for
its
repression
an
accord
was
reached
the
influence
of
which
will
be
very
helpful
and
extend
over
a
wide
region
as
soon
as
these
measures
shall
receive
the
sanction
of
the
netherlands
for
a
time
withheld
the
general
acts
will
be
submitted
for
ratification
by
the
senate
meanwhile
negotiations
have
been
opened
for
a
new
and
completed
treaty
of
friendship
commerce
and
navigation
between
the
united
states
and
the
independent
state
of
the
kongo
toward
the
end
of
the
past
year
the
only
independent
monarchical
government
on
the
western
continent
that
of
brazil
ceased
to
exist
and
was
succeeded
by
a
republic
diplomatic
relations
were
at
once
established
with
the
new
government
but
it
was
not
completely
recognized
until
an
opportunity
had
been
afforded
to
ascertain
that
it
had
popular
approval
and
support
when
the
course
of
events
had
yielded
assurance
of
this
fact
no
time
was
lost
in
extending
to
the
new
government
a
full
and
cordial
welcome
into
the
family
of
american
commonwealths
it
is
confidently
believed
that
the
good
relations
of
the
two
countries
will
be
preserved
and
that
the
future
will
witness
an
increased
intimacy
of
intercourse
and
an
expansion
of
their
mutual
commerce
the
peace
of
central
america
has
again
been
disturbed
through
a
revolutionary
change
in
salvador
which
was
not
recognized
by
other
states
and
hostilities
broke
out
between
salvador
and
guatemala
threatening
to
involve
all
central
america
in
conflict
and
to
undo
the
progress
which
had
been
made
toward
a
union
of
their
interests
the
efforts
of
this
government
were
promptly
and
zealously
exerted
to
compose
their
differences
and
through
the
active
efforts
of
the
representative
of
the
united
states
a
provisional
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
august
whereby
the
right
of
the
republic
of
salvador
to
choose
its
own
rulers
was
recognized
general
ezeta
the
chief
of
the
provisional
government
has
since
been
confirmed
in
the
presidency
by
the
assembly
and
diplomatic
recognition
duly
followed
the
killing
of
general
barrundia
on
board
the
pacific
mail
steamer
acapulco
while
anchored
in
transit
in
the
port
of
san
jose
de
guatemala
demanded
careful
inquiry
having
failed
in
a
revolutionary
attempt
to
invade
guatemala
from
mexican
territory
general
barrundia
took
passage
at
acapulco
for
panama
the
consent
of
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
was
sought
to
effect
his
seizure
first
at
champerico
where
the
steamer
touched
and
afterwards
at
san
jose
the
captain
of
the
steamer
refused
to
give
up
his
passenger
without
a
written
order
from
the
united
states
minister
the
latter
furnished
the
desired
letter
stipulating
as
the
condition
of
his
action
that
general
barrundias
life
should
be
spared
and
that
he
should
be
tried
only
for
offenses
growing
out
of
his
insurrectionary
movements
this
letter
was
produced
to
the
captain
of
the
acapulco
by
the
military
commander
at
san
jose
as
his
warrant
to
take
the
passenger
from
the
steamer
general
barrundia
resisted
capture
and
was
killed
it
being
evident
that
the
minister
mr
mizner
had
exceeded
the
bounds
of
his
authority
in
intervening
in
compliance
with
the
demands
of
the
guatemalan
authorities
to
authorize
and
effect
in
violation
of
precedent
the
seizure
on
a
vessel
of
the
united
states
of
a
passenger
in
transit
charged
with
political
offenses
in
order
that
he
might
be
tried
for
such
offenses
under
what
was
described
as
martial
law
i
was
constrained
to
disavow
mr
mizners
act
and
recall
him
from
his
post
the
nicaragua
canal
project
under
the
control
of
our
citizens
is
making
most
encouraging
progress
all
the
preliminary
conditions
and
initial
operations
having
been
accomplished
within
the
prescribed
time
during
the
past
year
negotiations
have
been
renewed
for
the
settlement
of
the
claims
of
american
citizens
against
the
government
of
chile
principally
growing
out
of
the
late
war
with
peru
the
reports
from
our
minister
at
santiago
warrant
the
expectation
of
an
early
and
satisfactory
adjustment
our
relations
with
china
which
have
for
several
years
occupied
so
important
a
place
in
our
diplomatic
history
have
called
for
careful
consideration
and
have
been
the
subject
of
much
correspondence
the
communications
of
the
chinese
minister
have
brought
into
view
the
whole
subject
of
our
conventional
relations
with
his
country
and
at
the
same
time
this
government
through
its
legation
at
peking
has
sought
to
arrange
various
matters
and
complaints
touching
the
interests
and
protection
of
our
citizens
in
china
in
pursuance
of
the
concurrent
resolution
of
october
i
have
proposed
to
the
governments
of
mexico
and
great
britain
to
consider
a
conventional
regulation
of
the
passage
of
chinese
laborers
across
our
southern
and
northern
frontiers
on
the
d
day
of
august
last
sir
edmund
monson
the
arbitrator
selected
under
the
treaty
of
december
rendered
an
award
to
the
effect
that
no
compensation
was
due
from
the
danish
government
to
the
united
states
on
account
of
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
carlos
butterfield
claim
our
relations
with
the
french
republic
continue
to
be
cordial
our
representative
at
that
court
has
very
diligently
urged
the
removal
of
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
our
meat
products
and
it
is
believed
that
substantial
progress
has
been
made
toward
a
just
settlement
the
samoan
treaty
signed
last
year
at
berlin
by
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
germany
and
great
britain
after
due
ratification
and
exchange
has
begun
to
produce
salutary
effects
the
formation
of
the
government
agreed
upon
will
soon
replace
the
disorder
of
the
past
by
a
stable
administration
alike
just
to
the
natives
and
equitable
to
the
three
powers
most
concerned
in
trade
and
intercourse
with
the
samoan
islands
the
chief
justice
has
been
chosen
by
the
king
of
sweden
and

on
the
invitation
of
the
three
powers
and
will
soon
be
installed
the

the
new
treaty
of
extradition
with
great
britain
after
due
ratification
was
proclaimed
on
the
th
of
last
march
its
beneficial
working
is
already
apparent
the
difference
between
the
two
governments
touching
the
furseal
question
in
the
bering
sea
is
not
yet
adjusted
as
will
be
seen
by
the
correspondence
which
will
soon
be
laid
before
the
congress
the
offer
to
submit
the
question
to
arbitration
as
proposed
by
her
majestys
government
has
not
been
accepted
for
the
reason
that
the
form
of
submission
proposed
is
not
thought
to
be
calculated
to
assure
a
conclusion
satisfactory
to
either
party
it
is
sincerely
hoped
that
b
efore
the
opening
of
another
sealing
season
some
arrangement
may
be
effected
which
will
assure
to
the
united
states
a
property
right
derived
from
russia
which
was
not
disregarded
by
any
nation
for
more
than
eighty
years
preceding
the
outbreak
of
the
existing
trouble
in
the
tariff
act
a
wrong
was
done
to
the
kingdom
of
hawaii
which
i
am
bound
to
presume
was
wholly
unintentional
duties
were
levied
on
certain
commodities
which
are
included
in
the
reciprocity
treaty
now
existing
between
the
united
states
and
the
kingdom
of
hawaii
without
indicating
the
necessary
exception
in
favor
of
that
kingdom
i
hope
congress
will
repair
what
might
otherwise
seem
to
be
a
breach
of
faith
on
the
part
of
this
government
an
award
in
favor
of
the
united
states
in
the
matter
of
the
claim
of
mr
van
bokkelen
against
hayti
was
rendered
on
the
th
of
december
but
owing
to
disorders
then
and
afterwards
prevailing
in
hayti
the
terms
of
payment
were
not
observed
a
new
agreement
as
to
the
time
of
payment
has
been
approved
and
is
now
in
force
other
just
claims
of
citizens
of
the

for
redress
of
wrongs
suffered
during
the
late
political
conflict
in
hayti
will
it
is
hoped
speedily
yield
to
friendly
treatment
propositions
for
the
amendment
of
the
treaty
of
extradition
between
the
united
states
and
italy
are
now
under
consideration
you
will
be
asked
to
provide
the
means
of
accepting
the
invitation
of
the
italian
government
to
take
part
in
an
approaching
conference
to
consider
the
adoption
of
a
universal
prime
meridian
from
which
to
reckon
longitude
and
time
as
this
proposal
follows
in
the
track
of
the
reform
sought
to
be
initiated
by
the
meridian
conference
of
washington
held
on
the
invitation
of
this
government
the
united
states
should
manifest
a
friendly
interest
in
the
italian
proposal
in
this
connection
i
may
refer
with
approval
to
the
suggestion
of
my
predecessors
that
standing
provision
be
made
for
accepting
whenever
deemed
advisable
the
frequent
invitations
of
foreign
governments
to
share
in
conferences
looking
to
the
advancement
of
international
reforms
in
regard
to
science
sanitation
commercial
laws
and
procedure
and
other
matters
affecting
the
intercourse
and
progress
of
modern
communities
in
the
summer
of
an
incident
occurred
which
for
some
time
threatened
to
interrupt
the
cordiality
of
our
relations
with
the
government
of
portugal
that
government
seized
the
delagoa
bay
railway
which
was
constructed
under
a
concession
granted
to
an
american
citizen
and
at
the
same
time
annulled
the
charter
the
concessionary
who
had
embarked
his
fortune
in
the
enterprise
having
exhausted
other
means
of
redress
was
compelled
to
invoke
the
protection
of
his
government
our
representations
made
coincidently
with
those
of
the
british
government
whose
subjects
were
also
largely
interested
happily
resulted
in
the
recognition
by
portugal
of
the
propriety
of
submitting
the
claim
for
indemnity
growing
out
of
its
action
to
arbitration
this
plan
of
settlement
having
been
agreed
upon
the
interested
powers
readily
concurred
in
the
proposal
to
submit
the
case
to
the
judgment
of
three
eminent
jurists
to
be
designated
by
the
president
of
the
swiss
republic
who
upon
the
joint
invitation
of
the
governments
of
the
united
states
great
britain
and
portugal
has
selected
persons
well
qualified
for
the
task
before
them
the
revision
of
our
treaty
relations
with
the
empire
of
japan
has
continued
to
be
the
subject
of
consideration
and
of
correspondence
the
questions
involved
are
both
grave
and
delicate
and
while
it
will
be
my
duty
to
see
that
the
interests
of
the
united
states
are
not
by
any
changes
exposed
to
undue
discrimination
i
sincerely
hope
that
such
revision
as
will
satisfy
the
legitimate
expectations
of
the
japanese
government
and
maintain
the
present
and
longexisting
friendly
relations
between
japan
and
the
united
states
will
be
effected
the
friendship
between
our
country
and
mexico
born
of
close
neighborhood
and
strengthened
by
many
considerations
of
intimate
intercourse
and
reciprocal
interest
has
never
been
more
conspicuous
than
now
nor
more
hopeful
of
increased
benefit
to
both
nations
the
intercourse
of
the
two
countries
by
rail
already
great
is
making
constant
growth
the
established
lines
and
those
recently
projected
add
to
the
intimacy
of
traffic
and
open
new
channels
of
access
to
fresh
areas
of
demand
and
supply
the
importance
of
the
mexican
railway
system
will
be
further
enhanced
to
a
degree
almost
impossible
to
forecast
if
it
should
become
a
link
in
the
projected
intercontinental
railway
i
recommend
that
our
mission
in
the
city
of
mexico
be
raised
to
the
first
class
the
cordial
character
of
our
relations
with
spain
warrants
the
hope
that
by
the
continuance
of
methods
of
friendly
negotiation
much
may
be
accomplished
in
the
direction
of
an
adjustment
of
pending
questions
and
of
the
increase
of
our
trade
the
extent
and
development
of
our
trade
with
the
island
of
cuba
invest
the
commercial
relations
of
the
united
states
and
spain
with
a
peculiar
importance
it
is
not
doubted
that
a
special
arrangement
in
regard
to
commerce
based
upon
the
reciprocity
provision
of
the
recent
tariff
act
would
operate
most
beneficially
for
both
governments
this
subject
is
now
receiving
attention
the
restoration
of
the
remains
of
john
ericsson
to
sweden
afforded
a
gratifying
occasion
to
honor
the
memory
of
the
great
inventor
to
whose
genius
our
country
owes
so
much
and
to
bear
witness
to
the
unbroken
friendship
which
has
existed
between
the
land
which
bore
him
and
our
own
which
claimed
him
as
a
citizen
on
the
d
of
september
last
the
commission
appointed
to
revise
the
proceedings
of
the
commission
under
the
claims
convention
between
the
united
states
and
venezuela
of
brought
its
labors
to
a
close
within
the
period
fixed
for
that
purpose
the
proceedings
of
the
late
commission
were
characterized
by
a
spirit
of
impartiality
and
a
high
sense
of
justice
and
an
incident
which
was
for
many
years
the
subject
of
discussion
between
the
two
governments
has
been
disposed
of
in
a
manner
alike
honorable
and
satisfactory
to
both
parties
for
the
settlement
of
the
claim
of
the
venezuela
steam
transportation
company
which
was
the
subject
of
a
joint
resolution
adopted
at
the
last
session
of
congress
negotiations
are
still
in
progress
and
their
early
conclusion
is
anticipated
the
legislation
of
the
past
few
years
has
evinced
on
the
part
of
congress
a
growing
realization
of
the
importance
of
the
consular
service
in
fostering
our
commercial
relations
abroad
and
in
protecting
the
domestic
revenues
as
the
scope
of
operations
expands
increased
provision
must
be
made
to
keep
up
the
essential
standard
of
efficiency
the
necessity
of
some
adequate
measure
of
supervision
and
inspection
has
been
so
often
presented
that
i
need
only
commend
the
subject
to
your
attention
the
revenues
of
the
government
from
all
sources
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
were
and
the
total
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
the
postal
receipts
have
not
heretofore
been
included
in
the
statement
of
these
aggregates
and
for
the
purpose
of
comparison
the
sum
of
should
be
deducted
from
both
sides
of
the
account
the
surplus
for
the
year
including
the
amount
applied
to
the
sinking
fund
was
the
receipts
for
were
and
the
expenditures
in
excess
of
those
of
the
customs
receipts
increased
and
the
receipts
from
internal
revenue
while
on
the
side
of
expenditures
that
for
pensions
was
in
excess
of
the
preceding
year
the
treasury
statement
for
the
current
fiscal
year
partly
actual
and
partly
estimated
is
as
follows
receipts
from
all
sources
total
expenditures
leaving
a
surplus
of
not
taking
the
postal
receipts
into
the
account
on
either
side
the
loss
of
revenue
from
customs
for
the
last
quarter
is
estimated
at
but
from
this
is
deducted
a
gain
of
about
realized
during
the
first
four
months
of
the
year
for
the
year
the
total
estimated
receipts
are
and
the
estimated
expenditures
leaving
an
estimated
surplus
of
which
with
a
cash
balance
of
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
will
give
as
the
sum
available
for
the
redemption
of
outstanding
bonds
or
other
uses
the
estimates
of
receipts
and
expenditures
for
the
postoffice
department
being
equal
are
not
included
in
this
statement
on
either
side
the
act
directing
the
purchase
of
silver
bullion
and
the
issue
of
treasury
notes
thereon
approved
july
has
been
administered
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
with
an
earnest
purpose
to
get
into
circulation
at
the
earliest
possible
dates
the
full
monthly
amounts
of
treasury
notes
contemplated
by
its
provisions
and
at
the
same
time
to
give
to
the
market
for
the
silver
bullion
such
support
as
the
law
contemplates
the
recent
depreciation
in
the
price
of
silver
has
been
observed
with
regret
the
rapid
rise
in
price
which
anticipated
and
followed
the
passage
of
the
act
was
influenced
in
some
degree
by
speculation
and
the
recent
reaction
is
in
part
the
result
of
the
same
cause
and
in
part
of
the
recent
monetary
disturbances
some
months
of
further
trial
will
be
necessary
to
determine
the
permanent
effect
of
the
recent
legislation
upon
silver
values
but
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
the
increased
circulation
secured
by
the
act
has
exerted
and
will
continue
to
exert
a
most
beneficial
influence
upon
business
and
upon
general
values
while
it
has
not
been
thought
best
to
renew
formally
the
suggestion
of
an
international
conference
looking
to
an
agreement
touching
the
full
use
of
silver
for
coinage
at
a
uniform
ratio
care
has
been
taken
to
observe
closely
any
change
in
the
situation
abroad
and
no
favorable
opportunity
will
be
lost
to
promote
a
result
which
it
is
confidently
believed
would
confer
very
large
benefits
upon
the
commerce
of
the
world
the
recent
monetary
disturbances
in
england
are
not
unlikely
to
suggest
a
reexamination
of
opinions
upon
this
subject
our
very
large
supply
of
gold
will
if
not
lost
by
impulsive
legislation
in
the
supposed
interest
of
silver
give
us
a
position
of
advantage
in
promoting
a
permanent
and
safe
international
agreement
for
the
free
use
of
silver
a
s
a
coin
metal
the
efforts
of
the
secretary
to
increase
the
volume
of
money
in
circulation
by
keeping
down
the
treasury
surplus
to
the
lowest
practicable
limit
have
been
unremitting
and
in
a
very
high
degree
successful
the
tables
presented
by
him
showing
the
increase
of
money
in
circulation
during
the
last
two
decades
and
especially
the
table
showing
the
increase
during
the
nineteen
months
he
has
administered
the
affairs
of
the
department
are
interesting
and
instructive
the
increase
of
money
in
circulation
during
the
nineteen
months
has
been
in
the
aggregate
or
about
per
capita
and
of
this
increase
only
was
due
to
the
recent
silver
legislation
that
this
substantial
and
needed
aid
given
to
commerce
resulted
in
an
enormous
reduction
of
the
public
debt
and
of
the
annual
interest
charge
is
matter
of
increased
satisfaction
there
have
been
purchased
and
redeemed
since
march
and
per
cent
bonds
to
the
amount
of
at
a
cost
of
resulting
in
the
reduction
of
the
annual
interest
charge
of
and
a
total
saving
of
interest
of
i
notice
with
great
pleasure
the
statement
of
the
secretary
that
the
receipts
from
internal
revenue
have
increased
during
the
last
fiscal
year
nearly
and
that
the
cost
of
collecting
this
larger
revenue
was
less
by
than
for
the
same
purpose
in
the
preceding
year
the
percentage
of
cost
of
collecting
the
customs
revenue
was
less
for
the
last
fiscal
year
than
ever
before
the
customs
administration
board
provided
for
by
the
act
of
june
was
selected
with
great
care
and
is
composed
in
part
of
men
whose
previous
experience
in
the
administration
of
the
old
customs
regulations
had
made
them
familiar
with
the
evils
to
be
remedied
and
in
part
of
men
whose
legal
and
judicial
acquirements
and
experience
seemed
to
fit
them
for
the
work
of
interpreting
and
applying
the
new
statute
the
chief
aim
of
the
law
is
to
secure
honest
valuations
of
all
dutiable
merchandise
and
to
make
these
valuations
uniform
at
all
our
ports
of
entry
it
had
been
made
manifest
by
a
congressional
investigation
that
a
system
of
undervaluation
had
been
long
in
use
by
certain
classes
of
importers
resulting
not
only
in
a
great
loss
of
revenue
but
in
a
most
intolerable
discrimination
against
honesty
it
is
not
seen
how
this
legislation
when
it
is
understood
can
be
regarded
by
the
citizens
of
any
country
having
commercial
dealings
with
us
as
unfriendly
if
any
duty
is
supposed
to
be
excessive
let
the
complaint
be
lodged
there
it
will
surely
not
be
claimed
by
any
welldisposed
people
that
a
remedy
may
be
sought
and
allowed
in
a
system
of
quasi
smuggling
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
exhibits
several
gratifying
results
attained
during
the
year
by
wise
and
unostentatious
methods
the
percentage
of
desertions
from
the
army
an
evil
for
which
both
congress
and
the
department
have
long
been
seeking
a
remedy
has
been
reduced
during
the
past
year
per
cent
and
for
the
months
of
august
and
september
during
which
time
the
favorable
effects
of
the
act
of
june
were
felt
per
cent
as
compared
with
the
same
months
of
the
results
attained
by
a
reorganization
and
consolidation
of
the
divisions
having
charge
of
the
hospital
and
service
records
of
the
volunteer
soldiers
are
very
remarkable
this
change
was
effected
in
july
and
at
that
time
there
were
cases
awaiting
attention
more
than
half
of
these
being
calls
from
the
pension
office
for
information
necessary
to
the
adjudication
of
pension
claims
on
the
th
day
of
june
last
though
over
new
calls
had
come
in
there
was
not
a
single
case
that
had
not
been
examined
and
answered
i
concur
in
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
that
adequate
and
regular
appropriations
be
continued
for
coastdefense
works
and
ordnance
plans
have
been
practically
agreed
upon
and
there
can
be
no
good
reason
for
delaying
the
execution
of
them
while
the
defenseless
state
of
our
great
seaports
furnishes
an
urgent
reason
for
wise
expedition
the
encouragement
that
has
been
extended
to
the
militia
of
the
states
generally
and
most
appropriately
designated
the
national
guard
should
be
continued
and
enlarged
these
military
organizations
constitute
in
a
large
sense
the
army
of
the
united
states
while
about
fivesixths
of
the
annual
cost
of
their
maintenance
is
defrayed
by
the
states
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
is
under
the
law
submitted
directly
to
congress
but
as
the
department
of
justice
is
one
of
the
executive
departments
some
reference
to
the
work
done
is
appropriate
here
a
vigorous
and
in
the
main
an
effective
effort
has
been
made
to
bring
to
trial
and
punishment
all
violators
of
the
law
but
at
the
same
time
care
has
been
taken
that
frivolous
and
technical
offenses
should
not
be
used
to
swell
the
fees
of
officers
or
to
harass
welldisposed
citizens
especial
attention
is
called
to
the
facts
connected
with
the
prosecution
of
violations
of
the
election
laws
and
of
offenses
against
united
states
officers
the
number
of
convictions
secured
very
many
of
them
upon
pleas
of
guilty
will
it
is
hoped
have
a
salutary
restraining
influence
there
have
been
several
cases
where
postmasters
appointed
by
me
have
been
subjected
to
violent
interference
in
the
discharge
of
their
official
duties
and
to
persecutions
and
personal
violence
of
the
most
extreme
character
some
of
these
cases
have
been
dealt
with
through
the
department
of
justice
and
in
some
cases
the
postoffices
have
been
abolished
or
suspended
i
have
directed
the
postmastergeneral
to
pursue
this
course
in
all
cases
where
other
efforts
failed
to
secure
for
any
postmaster
not
himself
in
fault
an
opportunity
peacefully
to
exercise
the
duties
of
his
office
but
such
action
will
not
supplant
the
efforts
of
the
department
of
justice
to
bring
the
particular
offenders
to
punishment
the
vacation
by
judicial
decrees
of
fraudulent
certificates
of
naturalization
upon
bills
in
equity
filed
by
the
attorneygeneral
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
united
states
is
a
new
application
of
a
familiar
equity
jurisdiction
nearly
one
hundred
such
decrees
have
been
taken
during
the
year
the
evidence
disclosing
that
a
very
large
number
of
fraudulent
certificates
of
naturalization
have
been
issued
and
in
this
connection
i
beg
to
renew
my
recommendation
that
the
laws
be
so
amended
as
to
require
a
more
full
and
searching
inquiry
into
all
the
facts
necessary
to
naturalization
before
any
certificates
are
granted
it
certainly
is
not
too
much
to
require
that
an
application
for
american
citizenship
shall
be
heard
with
as
much
care
and
recorded
with
as
much
formality
as
are
given
to
cases
involving
the
pettiest
property
right
at
the
last
session
i
returned
without
my
approval
a
bill
entitled
an
act
to
prohibit
bookmaking
and
pool
selling
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
stated
my
objection
to
be
that
it
did
not
prohibit
but
in
fact
licensed
what
it
purported
to
prohibit
an
effort
will
be
made
under
existing
laws
to
suppress
this
evil
though
it
is
not
certain
that
they
will
be
found
adequate
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
shows
the
most
gratifying
progress
in
the
important
work
committed
to
his
direction
the
business
methods
have
been
greatly
improved
a
large
economy
in
expenditures
and
an
increase
of
four
and
threequarters
millions
in
receipts
have
been
realized
the
deficiency
this
year
is
as
against
last
year
notwithstanding
the
great
enlargement
of
the
service
mail
routes
have
been
extended
and
quickened
and
greater
accuracy
and
dispatch
in
distribution
and
delivery
have
been
attained
the
report
will
be
found
to
be
full
of
interest
and
suggestion
not
only
to
congress
but
to
those
thoughtful
citizens
who
may
be
interested
to
know
what
business
methods
can
do
for
that
department
of
public
administration
which
most
nearly
touches
all
our
people
the
passage
of
the
act
to
amend
certain
sections
of
the
revised
statutes
relating
to
lotteries
approved
september
has
been
received
with
great
and
deserved
popular
favor
the
postoffice
department
and
the
department
of
justice
at
once
entered
upon
the
enforcement
of
the
law
with
sympathetic
vigor
and
already
the
public
mails
have
been
largely
freed
from
the
fraudulent
and
demoralizing
appeals
and
literature
emanating
from
the
lottery
companies
the
construction
and
equipment
of
the
new
ships
for
the
navy
have
made
very
satisfactory
progress
since
march
nine
new
vessels
have
been
put
in
commission
and
during
this
winter
four
more
including
one
monitor
will
be
added
the
construction
of
the
other
vessels
authorized
is
being
pushed
both
in
the
government
and
private
yards
with
energy
and
watched
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
the
experiments
conducted
during
the
year
to
test
the
relative
resisting
power
of
armor
plates
have
been
so
valuable
as
to
attract
great
attention
in
europe
the
only
part
of
the
work
upon
the
new
ships
that
is
threatened
by
unusual
delay
is
the
armor
plating
and
every
effort
is
being
made
to
reduce
that
to
the
minimum
it
is
a
source
of
congratulation
that
the
anticipated
influence
of
these
modern
vessels
upon
the
esprit
de
corps
of
the
officers
and
seamen
has
been
fully
realized
confidence
and
pride
in
the
ship
among
the
crew
are
equivalent
to
a
secondary
battery
your
favorable
consideration
is
invited
to
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
exhibits
with
great
fullness
and
clearness
the
vast
work
of
that
department
and
the
satisfactory
results
attained
the
suggestions
made
by
him
are
earnestly
commended
to
the
consideration
of
congress
though
they
can
not
all
be
given
particular
mention
here
the
several
acts
of
congress
looking
to
the
reduction
of
the
larger
indian
reservations
to
the
more
rapid
settlement
of
the
indians
upon
individual
allotments
and
the
restoration
to
the
public
domain
of
lands
in
excess
of
their
needs
have
been
largely
carried
into
effect
so
far
as
the
work
was
confided
to
the
executive
agreements
have
been
concluded
since
march
involving
the
cession
to
the
united
states
of
about
acres
of
land
these
contracts
have
as
required
by
law
been
submitted
to
congress
for
ratification
and
for
the
appropriations
necessary
to
carry
them
into

effect
those
with
the
sisseton
and
wahpeton
sac
and
fox
iowa
pottawatomies
and
absentee
shawnees
and
coeur
dalene
tribes
have
not
yet
received
the
sanction
of
congress
attention
is
also
called
to
the
fact
that
the
appropriations
made
in
the
case
of
the
sioux
indians
have
not
covered
all
the
stipulated
payments
this
should
be
promptly
corrected
if
an
agreement
is
confirmed
all
of
its
terms
should
be
complied
with
without
delay
and
full
appropriations
should
be
made
the
policy
outlined
in
my
last
annual
message
in
relation
to
the
patenting
of
lands
to
settlers
upon
the
public
domain
has
been
carried
out
in
the
administration
of
the
land
office
no
general
suspicion
or
imputation
of
fraud
has
been
allowed
to
delay
the
hearing
and
adjudication
of
individual
cases
upon
their
merits
the
purpose
has
been
to
perfect
the
title
of
honest
settlers
with
such
promptness
that
the
value
of
the
entry
might
not
be
swallowed
up
by
the
expense
and
extortions
to
which
delay
subjected
the
claimant
the
average
monthly
issue
of
agricultural
patents
has
been
increased
about
the
disabilitypension
act
which
was
approved
on
the
th
of
june
last
has
been
put
into
operation
as
rapidly
as
was
practicable
the
increased
clerical
force
provided
was
selected
and
assigned
to
work
and
a
considerable
part
of
the
force
engaged
in
examinations
in
the
field
was
recalled
and
added
to
the
working
force
of
the
office
the
examination
and
adjudication
of
claims
have
by
reason
of
improved
methods
been
more
rapid
than
ever
before
there
is
no
economy
to
the
government
in
delay
while
there
is
much
hardship
and
injustice
to
the
soldier
the
anticipated
expenditure
while
very
large
will
not
it
is
believed
be
in
excess
of
the
estimates
made
before
the
enactment
of
the
law
this
liberal
enlargement
of
the
general
law
should
suggest
a
more
careful
scrutiny
of
bills
for
special
relief
both
as
to
the
cases
where
relief
is
granted
and
as
to
the
amount
allowed
the
increasing
numbers
and
influence
of
the
nonmormon
population
of
utah
are
observed
with
satisfaction
the
recent
letter
of
wilford
woodruff
president
of
the
mormon
church
in
which
he
advised
his
people
to
refrain
from
contracting
any
marriage
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
the
land
has
attracted
wide
attention
and
it
is
hoped
that
its
influence
will
be
highly
beneficial
in
restraining
infractions
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
but
the
fact
should
not
be
overlooked
that
the
doctrine
or
belief
of
the
church
that
polygamous
marriages
are
rightful
and
supported
by
divine
revelation
remains
unchanged
president
woodruff
does
not
renounce
the
doctrine
but
refrains
from
teaching
it
and
advises
against
the
practice
of
it
because
the
law
is
against
it
now
it
is
quite
true
that
the
law
should
not
attempt
to
deal
with
the
faith
or
belief
of
anyone
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
and
the
only
safe
thing
so
to
deal
with
the
territory
of
utah
as
that
those
who
believe
polygamy
to
be
rightful
shall
not
have
the
power
to
make
it
lawful
the
admission
of
the
states
of
wyoming
and
idaho
to
the
union
are
events
full
of
interest
and
congratulation
not
only
to
the
people
of
those
states
now
happily
endowed
with
a
full
participation
in
our
privileges
and
responsibilities
but
to
all
our
people
another
belt
of
states
stretches
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
the
work
of
the
patent
office
has
won
from
all
sources
very
high
commendation
the
amount
accomplished
has
been
very
largely
increased
and
all
the
results
have
been
such
as
to
secure
confidence
and
consideration
for
the
suggestions
of
the
commissioner
the
enumeration
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
march
has
been
completed
and
the
result
will
be
at
once
officially
communicated
to
congress
the
completion
of
this
decennial
enumeration
devolves
upon
congress
the
duty
of
making
a
new
apportionment
of
representatives
among
the
several
states
according
to
their
respective
numbers
at
the
last
session
i
had
occasion
to
return
with
my
objections
several
bills
making
provisions
for
the
erection
of
public
buildings
for
the
reason
that
the
expenditures
contemplated
were
in
my
opinion
greatly
in
excess
of
any
public
need
no
class
of
legislation
is
more
liable
to
abuse
or
to
degenerate
into
an
unseemly
scramble
about
the
public
treasury
than
this
there
should
be
exercised
in
this
matter
a
wise
economy
based
upon
some
responsible
and
impartial
examination
and
report
as
to
each
case
under
a
general
law
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
deserves
especial
attention
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
year
has
been
marked
in
a
very
unusual
degree
by
agitation
and
organization
among
the
farmers
looking
to
an
increase
in
the
profits
of
their
business
it
will
be
found
that
the
efforts
of
the
department
have
been
intelligently
and
zealously
devoted
to
the
promotion
of
the
interests
intrusted
to
its
care
a
very
substantial
improvement
in
the
market
prices
of
the
leading
farm
products
during
the
year
is
noticed
the
price
of
wheat
advanced
from
cents
in
october
to
in
october
corn
from
cents
to
cents
oats
from
cents
to
cents
and
barley
from
cents
to
cents
meats
showed
a
substantial
but
not
so
large
an
increase
the
export
trade
in
live
animals
and
fowls
shows
a
very
large
increase
the
total
value
of
such
exports
for
the
year
ending
june
was
and
the
increase
over
the
preceding
year
was
over
nearly
more
cattle
and
over
more
hogs
were
exported
than
in
the
preceding
year
the
export
trade
in
beef
and
pork
products
and
in
dairy
products
was
very
largely
increased
the
increase
in
the
article
of
butter
alone
being
from
pounds
to
pounds
and
the
total
increase
in
the
value
of
meat
and
dairy
products
exported
being
this
trade
so
directly
helpful
to
the
farmer
it
is
believed
will
be
yet
further
and
very
largely
increased
when
the
system
of
inspection
and
sanitary
supervision
now
provided
by
law
is
brought
fully
into
operation
the
efforts
of
the
secretary
to
establish
the
healthfulness
of
our
meats
against
the
disparaging
imputations
that
have
been
put
upon
them
abroad
have
resulted
in
substantial
progress
veterinary
surgeons
sent
out
by
the
department
are
now
allowed
to
participate
in
the
inspection
of
the
live
cattle
from
this
country
landed
at
the
english
docks
and
during
the
several
months
they
have
been
on
duty
no
case
of
contagious
pleuropneumonia
has
been
reported
this
inspection
abroad
and
the
domestic
inspection
of
live
animals
and
pork
products
provided
for
by
the
act
of
august
will
afford
as
perfect
a
guaranty
for
the
wholesomeness
of
our
meats
offered
for
foreign
consumption
as
is
anywhere
given
to
any
food
product
and
its
nonacceptance
will
quite
clearly
reveal
the
real
motive
of
any
continued
restriction
of
their
use
and
that
having
been
made
clear
the
duty
of
the
executive
will
be
very
plain
the
information
given
by
the
secretary
of
the
progress
and
prospects
of
the
beetsugar
industry
is
full
of
interest
it
has
already
passed
the
experimental
stage
and
is
a
commercial
success
the
area
over
which
the
sugar
beet
can
be
successfully
cultivated
is
very
large
and
another
field
crop
of
great
value
is
offered
to
the
choice
of
the
farmer
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
concurs
in
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
that
the
official
supervision
provided
by
the
tariff
law
for
sugar
of
domestic
production
shall
be
transferred
to
the
department
of
agriculture
the
law
relating
to
the
civil
service
has
so
far
as
i
can
learn
been
executed
by
those
having
the
power
of
appointment
in
the
classified
service
with
fidelity
and
impartiality
and
the
service
has
been
increasingly
satisfactory
the
report
of
the
commission
shows
a
large
amount
of
good
work
done
during
the
year
with
very
limited
appropriations
i
congratulate
the
congress
and
the
country
upon
the
passage
at
the
first
session
of
the
fiftyfirst
congress
of
an
unusual
number
of
laws
of
very
high
importance
that
the
results
of
this
legislation
will
be
the
quickening
and
enlargement
of
our
manufacturing
industries
larger
and
better
markets
for
our
breadstuffs
and
provisions
both
at
home
and
abroad
more
constant
employment
and
better
wages
for
our
working
people
and
an
increased
supply
of
a
safe
currency
for
the
transaction
of
business
i
do
not
doubt
some
of
these
measures
were
enacted
at
so
late
a
period
that
the
beneficial
effects
upon
commerce
which
were
in
the
contemplation
of
congress
have
as
yet
but
partially
manifested
themselves
the
general
trade
and
industrial
conditions
throughout
the
country
during
the
year
have
shown
a
marked
improvement
for
many
years
prior
to
the
merchandise
balances
of
foreign
trade
had
been
largely
in
our
favor
but
during
that
year
and
the
year
following
they
turned
against
us
it
is
very
gratifying
to
know
that
the
last
fiscal
year
again
shows
a
balance
in
our
favor
of
over
the
bank
clearings
which
furnish
a
good
test
of
the
volume
of
business
transacted
for
the
first
ten
months
of
the
year
show
as
compared
with
the
same
months
of
an
increase
for
the
whole
country
of
about
per
cent
while
the
increase
outside
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
over
per
cent
during
the
month
of
october
the
clearings
of
the
whole
country
showed
an
increase
of
per
cent
over
october
while
outside
of
new
york
the
increase
was
per
cent
these
figures
show
that
the
increase
in
the
volume
of
business
was
very
general
throughout
the
country
that
this
larger
business
was
being
conducted
upon
a
safe
and
profitable
basis
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
were
less
failures
reported
in
october
than
in
the
same
month
of
the
preceding
year
with
liabilities
diminished
by
about
the
value
of
our
exports
of
domestic
merchandise
during
the
last
year
was
over
greater
than
the
preceding
year
and
was
only
exceeded
once
in
our
history
about
of
this
excess
was
in
agricultural
products
the
production
of
pig
iron
always
a
good
gauge
of
general
prosperity
is
shown
by
a
recent
census
bulletin
to
have
been
per
cent
greater
in
than
in
and
the
production
of
steel
per
cent
greater
mining
in
coal
has
had
no
limitation
except
that
resulting
from
deficient

transportation
the
general
testimony
is
that
labor
is
everywhere
fully
employed
and
the
reports
for
the
last
year
show
a
smaller
number
of
employees
affected
by
strikes
and
lockouts
than
in
any
year
since
the
depression
in
the
prices
of
agricultural
products
had
been
greatly
relieved
and
a
buoyant
and
hopeful
tone
was
beginning
to
be
felt
by
all
our
people
these
promising
influences
have
been
in
some
degree
checked
by
the
surprising
and
very
unfavorable
monetary
events
which
have
recently
taken
place
in
england
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
these
did
not
grow
in
any
degree
out
of
the
financial
relations
of
london
with
our
people
or
out
of
any
discredit
attached
to
our
securities
held
in
that
market
the
return
of
our
bonds
and
stocks
was
caused
by
a
money
stringency
in
england
not
by
any
loss
of
value
or
credit
in
the
securities
themselves
we
could
not
however
wholly
escape
the
ill
effects
of
a
foreign
monetary
agitation
accompanied
by
such
extraordinary
incidents
as
characterized
this
it
is
not
believed
however
that
these
evil
incidents
which
have
for
the
time
unfavorably
affected
values
in
this
country
can
long
withstand
the
strong
safe
and
wholesome
influences
which
are
operating
to
give
to
our
people
profitable
returns
in
all
branches
of
legitimate
trade
and
industry
the
apprehension
that
our
tariff
may
again
and
at
once
be
subjected
to
important
general
changes
would
undoubtedly
add
a
depressing
influence
of
the
most
serious
character
the
general
tariff
act
has
only
partially
gone
into
operation
some
of
its
important
provisions
being
limited
to
take
effect
at
dates
yet
in
the
future
the
general
provisions
of
the
law
have
been
in
force
less
than
sixty
days
its
permanent
effects
upon
trade
and
prices
still
largely
stand
in
conjecture
it
is
curious
to
note
that
the
advance
in
the
prices
of
articles
wholly
unaffected
by
the
tariff
act
was
by
many
hastily
ascribed
to
that
act
notice
was
not
taken
of
the
fact
that
the
general
tendency
of
the
markets
was
upward
from
influences
wholly
apart
from
the
recent
tariff
legislation
the
enlargement
of
our
currency
by
the
silver
bill
undoubtedly
gave
an
upward
tendency
to
trade
and
had
a
marked
effect
on
prices
but
this
natural
and
desired
effect
of
the
silver
legislation
was
by
many
erroneously
attributed
to
the
tariff
act
there
is
neither
wisdom
nor
justice
in
the
suggestion
that
the
subject
of
tariff
revision
shall
be
again
opened
before
this
law
has
had
a
fair
trial
it
is
quite
true
that
every
tariff
schedule
is
subject
to
objections
no
bill
was
ever
framed
i
suppose
that
in
all
of
its
rates
and
classifications
had
the
full
approval
even
of
a
party
caucus
such
legislation
is
always
and
necessarily
the
product
of
compromise
as
to
details
and
the
present
law
is
no
exception
but
in
its
general
scope
and
effect
i
think
it
will
justify
the
support
of
those
who
believe
that
american
legislation
should
conserve
and
defend
american
trade
and
the
wages
of
american
workmen
the
misinformation
as
to
the
terms
of
the
act
which
has
been
so
widely
disseminated
at
home
and
abroad
will
be
corrected
by
experience
and
the
evil
auguries
as
to
its
results
confounded
by
the
market
reports
the
savings
banks
international
trade
balances
and
the
general
prosperity
of
our
people
already
we
begin
to
hear
from
abroad
and
from
our
customhouses
that
the
prohibitory
effect
upon
importations
imputed
to
the
act
is
not
justified
the
imports
at
the
port
of
new
york
for
the
first
three
weeks
of
november
were
nearly
per
cent
greater
than
for
the
same
period
in
and
per
cent
greater
than
in
the
same
period
of
and
so
far
from
being
an
act
to
limit
exports
i
confidently
believe
that
under
it
we
shall
secure
a
larger
and
more
profitable
participation
in
foreign
trade
than
we
have
ever
enjoyed
and
that
we
shall
recover
a
proportionate
participation
in
the
ocean
carrying
trade
of
the
world
the
criticisms
of
the
bill
that
have
come
to
us
from
foreign
sources
may
well
be
rejected
for
repugnancy
if
these
critics
really
believe
that
the
adoption
by
us
of
a
freetrade
policy
or
of
tariff
rates
having
reference
solely
to
revenue
would
diminish
the
participation
of
their
own
countries
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
their
advocacy
and
promotion
by
speech
and
other
forms
of
organized
effort
of
this
movement
among
our
people
is
a
rare
exhibition
of
unselfishness
in
trade
and
on
the
other
hand
if
they
sincerely
believe
that
the
adoption
of
a
protectivetariff
policy
by
this
country
inures
to
their
profit
and
our
hurt
it
is
noticeably
strange
that
they
should
lead
the
outcry
against
the
authors
of
a
policy
so
helpful
to
their
countrymen
and
crown
with
their
favor
those
who
would
snatch
from
them
a
substantial
share
of
a
trade
with
other
lands
already
inadequate
to
their
necessities
there
is
no
disposition
among
any
of
our
people
to
promote
prohibitory
or
retaliatory
legislation
our
policies
are
adopted
not
to
the
hurt
of
others
but
to
secure
for
ourselves
those
advantages
that
fairly
grow
out
of
our
favored
position
as
a
nation
our
form
of
government
with
its
incident
of
universal
suffrage
makes
it
imperative
that
we
shall
save
our
working
people
from
the
agitations
and
distresses
which
scant
work
and
wages
that
have
no
margin
for
comfort
always
beget
but
after
all
this
is
done
it
will
be
found
that
our
markets
are
open
to
friendly
commercial
exchanges
of
enormous
value
to
the
other
great
powers
from
the
time
of
my
induction
into
office
the
duty
of
using
every
power
and
influence
given
by
law
to
the
executive
department
for
the
development
of
larger
markets
for
our
products
especially
our
farm
products
has
been
kept
constantly
in
mind
and
no
effort
has
been
or
will
be
spared
to
promote
that
end
we
are
under
no
disadvantage
in
any
foreign
market
except
that
we
pay
our
workmen
and
workwomen
better
wages
than
are
paid
elsewherebetter
abstractly
better
relatively
to
the
cost
of
the
necessaries
of
life
i
do
not
doubt
that
a
very
largely
increased
foreign
trade
is
accessible
to
us
without
bartering
for
it
either
our
home
market
for
such
products
of
the
farm
and
shop
as
our
own
people
can
supply
or
the
wages
of
our
working
people
in
many
of
the
products
of
wood
and
iron
and
in
meats
and
breadstuffs
we
have
advantages
that
only
need
better
facilities
of
intercourse
and
transportation
to
secure
for
them
large
foreign
markets
the
reciprocity
clause
of
the
tariff
act
wisely
and
effectively
opens
the
way
to
secure
a
large
reciprocal
trade
in
exchange
for
the
free
admission
to
our
ports
of
certain
products
the
right
of
independent
nations
to
make
special
reciprocal
trade
concessions
is
well
established
and
does
not
impair
either
the
comity
due
to
other
powers
or
what
is
known
as
the
favorednation
clause
so
generally
found
in
commercial
treaties
what
is
given
to
one
for
an
adequate
agreed
consideration
can
not
be
claimed
by
another
freely
the
state
of
the
revenues
was
such
that
we
could
dispense
with
any
import
duties
upon
coffee
tea
hides
and
the
lower
grades
of
sugar
and
molasses
that
the
large
advantage
resulting
to
the
countries
producing
and
exporting
these
articles
by
placing
them
on
the
free
list
entitled
us
to
expect
a
fair
return
in
the
way
of
customs
concessions
upon
articles
exported
by
us
to
them
was
so
obvious
that
to
have
gratuitously
abandoned
this
opportunity
to
enlarge
our
trade
would
have
been
an
unpardonable
error
there
were
but
two
methods
of
maintaining
control
of
this
question
open
to
congressto
place
all
of
these
articles
upon
the
dutiable
list
subject
to
such
treaty
agreements
as
could
be
secured
or
to
place
them
all
presently
upon
the
free
list
but
subject
to
the
reimposition
of
specified
duties
if
the
countries
from
which
we
received
them
should
refuse
to
give
to
us
suitable
reciprocal
benefits
this
latter
method
i
think
possesses
great
advantages
it
expresses
in
advance
the
consent
of
congress
to
reciprocity
arrangements
affecting
these
products
which
must
otherwise
have
been
delayed
and
unascertained
until
each
treaty
was
ratified
by
the
senate
and
the
necessary
legislation
enacted
by
congress
experience
has
shown
that
some
treaties
looking
to
reciprocal
trade
have
failed
to
secure
a
twothirds
vote
in
the
senate
for
ratification
and
others
having
passed
that
stage
have
for
years
awaited
the
concurrence
of
the
house
and
senate
in
such
modifications
of
our
revenue
laws
as
were
necessary
to
give
effect
to
their
provisions
we
now
have
the
concurrence
of
both
houses
in
advance
in
a
distinct
and
definite
offer
of
free
entry
to
our
ports
of
specific
articles
the
executive
is
not
required
to
deal
in
conjecture
as
to
what
congress
will
accept
indeed
this
reciprocity
provision
is
more
than
an
offer
our
part
of
the
bargain
is
complete
delivery
has
been
made
and
when
the
countries
from
which
we
receive
sugar
coffee
tea
and
hides
have
placed
on
their
free
lists
such
of
our
products
as
shall
be
agreed
upon
as
an
equivalent
for
our
concession
a
proclamation
of
that
fact
completes
the
transaction
and
in
the
meantime
our
own
people
have
free
sugar
tea
coffee
and
hides
the
indications
thus
far
given
are
very
hopeful
of
early
and
favorable
action
by
the
countries
from
which
we
receive
our
large
imports
of
coffee
and
sugar
and
it
is
confidently
believed
that
if
steam
communication
with
these
countries
can
be
promptly
improved
and
enlarged
the
next
year
will
show
a
most
gratifying
increase
in
our
exports
of
breadstuffs
and
provisions
as
well
as
of
some
important
lines
of
manufactured
goods
in
addition
to
the
important
bills
that
became
laws
before
the
adjournment
of
the
last
session
some
other
bills
of
the
highest
importance
were
well
advanced
toward
a
final
vote
and
now
stand
upon
the
calendars
of
the
two
houses
in
favored
positions
the
present
session
has
a
fixed
limit
and
if
these
measures
are
not
now
brought
to
a
final
vote
all
the
work
that
has
been
done
upon
them
by
this
congress
is
lost
the
proper
consideration
of
these
of
an
apportionment
bill
and
of
the
annual
appropriation
bills
will
require
not
only
that
no
working
day
of

the
session
shall
be
lost
but
that
measures
of
minor
and
local
interest
shall
not
be
allowed
to
interrupt
or
retard
the
progress
of
those
that
are
of
universal
interest
in
view
of
these
conditions
i
refrain
from
bringing
before
you
at
this
time
some
suggestions
that
would
otherwise
be
made
and
most
earnestly
invoke
your
attention
to
the
duty
of
perfecting
the
important
legislation
now
well
advanced
to
some
of
these
measures
which
seem
to
me
most
important
i
now
briefly
call
your
attention
i
desire
to
repeat
with
added
urgency
the
recommendations
contained
in
my
last
annual
message
in
relation
to
the
development
of
american
steamship
lines
the
reciprocity
clause
of
the
tariff
bill
will
be
largely
limited
and
its
benefits
retarded
and
diminished
if
provision
is
not
contemporaneously
made
to
encourage
the
establishment
of
firstclass
steam
communication
between
our
ports
and
the
ports
of
such
nations
as
may
meet
our
overtures
for
enlarged
commercial
exchanges
the
steamship
carrying
the
mails
statedly
and
frequently
and
offering
to
passengers
a
comfortable
safe
and
speedy
transit
is
the
first
condition
of
foreign
trade
it
carries
the
order
or
the
buyer
but
not
all
that
is
ordered
or
bought
it
gives
to
the
sailing
vessels
such
cargoes
as
are
not
urgent
or
perishable
and
indirectly
at
least
promotes
that
important
adjunct
of
commerce
there
is
now
both
in
this
country
and
in
the
nations
of
central
and
south
america
a
state
of
expectation
and
confidence
as
to
increased
trade
that
will
give
a
double
value
to
your
prompt
action
upon
this
question
the
present
situation
of
our
mail
communication
with
australia
illustrates
the
importance
of
early
action
by
congress
the
oceanic
steamship
company
maintains
a
line
of
steamers
between
san
francisco
sydney
and
auckland
consisting
of
three
vessels
two
of
which
are
of
united
states
registry
and
one
of
foreign
registry
for
the
service
done
by
this
line
in
carrying
the
mails
we
pay
annually
the
sum
of
being
as
estimated
the
full
sea
and
united
states
inland
postage
which
is
the
limit
fixed
by
law
the
colonies
of
new
south
wales
and
new
zealand
have
been
paying
annually
to
these
lines
lbs
for
carrying
the
mails
from
sydney
and
auckland
to
san
francisco
the
contract
under
which
this
payment
has
been
made
is
now
about
to
expire
and
those
colonies
have
refused
to
renew
the
contract
unless
the
united
states
shall
pay
a
more
equitable
proportion
of
the
whole
sum
necessary
to
maintain
the
service
i
am
advised
by
the
postmastergeneral
that
the
united
states
receives
for
carrying
the
australian
mails
brought
to
san
francisco
in
these
steamers
by
rail
to
vancouver
an
estimated
annual
income
of
while
as
i
have
stated
we
are
paying
out
for
the
support
of
the
steamship
line
that
brings
this
mail
to
us
only
leaving
an
annual
surplus
resulting
from
this
service
of
the
trade
of
the
united
states
with
australia
which
is
in
a
considerable
part
carried
by
these
steamers
and
the
whole
of
which
is
practically
dependent
upon
the
mail
communication
which
they
maintain
is
largely
in
our
favor
our
total
exports
of
merchandise
to
australasian
ports
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
were
while
the
total
imports
of
merchandise
from
these
ports
were
only
if
we
are
not
willing
to
see
this
important
steamship
line
withdrawn
or
continued
with
vancouver
substituted
for
san
francisco
as
the
american
terminal
congress
should
put
it
in
the
power
of
the
postmastergeneral
to
make
a
liberal
increase
in
the
amount
now
paid
for
the
transportation
of
this
important
mail
the
south
atlantic
and
gulf
ports
occupy
a
very
favored
position
toward
the
new
and
important
commerce
which
the
reciprocity
clause
of
the
tariff
act
and
the
postal
shipping
bill
are
designed
to
promote
steamship
lines
from
these
ports
to
some
northern
port
of
south
america
will
almost
certainly
effect
a
connection
between
the
railroad
systems
of
the
continents
long
before
any
continuous
line
of
railroads
can
be
put
into
operation
the
very
large
appropriation
made
at
the
last
session
for
the
harbor
of
galveston
was
justified
as
it
seemed
to
me
by
these
considerations
the
great
northwest
will
feel
the
advantage
of
trunk
lines
to
the
south
as
well
as
to
the
east
and
of
the
new
markets
opened
for
their
surplus
food
products
and
for
many
of
their
manufactured
products
i
had
occasion
in
may
last
to
transmit
to
congress
a
report
adopted
by
the
international
american
conference
upon
the
subject
of
the
incorporation
of
an
international
american
bank
with
a
view
to
facilitating
money
exchanges
between
the
states
represented
in
that
conference
such
an
institution
would
greatly
promote
the
trade
we
are
seeking
to
develop
i
renew
the
recommendation
that
a
careful
and
wellguarded
charter
be
granted
i
do
not
think
the
powers
granted
should
include
those
ordinarily
exercised
by
trust
guaranty
and
safedeposit
companies
or
that
more
branches
in
the
united
states
should
be
authorized
than
are
strictly
necessary
to
accomplish
the
object
primarily
in
view
namely
convenient
foreign
exchanges
it
is
quite
important
that
prompt
action
should
be
taken
in
this
matter
in
order
that
any
appropriations
for
better
communication
with
these
countries
and
any
agreements
that
may
be
made
for
reciprocal
trade
may
not
be
hindered
by
the
inconvenience
of
making
exchanges
through
european
money
centers
or
burdened
by
the
tribute
which
is
an
incident
of
that
method
of
business
the
bill
for
the
relief
of
the
supreme
court
has
after
many
years
of
discussion
reached
a
position
where
final
action
is
easily
attainable
and
it
is
hoped
that
any
differences
of
opinion
may
be
so
harmonized
as
to
save
the
essential
features
of
this
very
important
measure
in
this
connection
i
earnestly
renew
my
recommendation
that
the
salaries
of
the
judges
of
the
united
states
district
courts
be
so
readjusted
that
none
of
them
shall
receive
less
than
per
annum
the
subject
of
the
unadjusted
spanish
and
mexican
land
grants
and
the
urgent
necessity
for
providing
some
commission
or
tribunal
for
the
trial
of
questions
of
title
growing
out
of
them
were
twice
brought
by
me
to
the
attention
of
congress
at
the
last
session
bills
have
been
reported
from
the
proper
committees
in
both
houses
upon
the
subject
and
i
very
earnestly
hope
that
this
congress
will
put
an
end
to
the
delay
which
has
attended
the
settlement
of
the
disputes
as
to
the
title
between
the
settlers
and
the
claimants
under
these
grants
these
disputes
retard
the
prosperity
and
disturb
the
peace
of
large
and
important
communities
the
governor
of
new
mexico
in
his
last
report
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
suggests
some
modifications
of
the
provisions
of
the
pending
bills
relating
to
the
small
holdings
of
farm
lands
i
commend
to
your
attention
the
suggestions
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
upon
this
subject
the
enactment
of
a
national
bankrupt
law
i
still
regard
as
very
desirable
the
constitution
having
given
to
congress
jurisdiction
of
this
subject
it
should
be
exercised
and
uniform
rules
provided
for
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
insolvent
debtors
the
inconveniences
resulting
from
the
occasional
and
temporary
exercise
of
this
power
by
congress
and
from
the
conflicting
state
codes
of
insolvency
which
come
into
force
intermediately
should
be
removed
by
the
enactment
of
a
simple
inexpensive
and
permanent
national
bankrupt
law
i
also
renew
my
recommendation
in
favor
of
legislation
affording
just
copyright
protection
to
foreign
authors
on
a
footing
of
reciprocal
advantage
for
our
authors
abroad
it
may
still
be
possible
for
this
congress
to
inaugurate
by
suitable
legislation
a
movement
looking
to
uniformity
and
increased
safety
in
the
use
of
couplers
and
brakes
upon
freight
trains
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
the
chief
difficulty
in
the
way
is
to
secure
agreement
as
to
the
best
appliances
simplicity
effectiveness
and
cost
being
considered
this
difficulty
will
only
yield
to
legislation
which
should
be
based
upon
full
inquiry
and
impartial
tests
the
purpose
should
be
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
all
welldisposed
managers
and
owners
but
the
fearful
fact
that
every
years
delay
involves
the
sacrifice
of
lives
and
the
maiming
of
young
men
should
plead
both
with
congress
and
the
managers
against
any
needless
delay
the
subject
of
the
conservation
and
equal
distribution
of
the
water
supply
of
the
arid
regions
has
had
much
attention
from
congress
but
has
not
as
yet
been
put
upon
a
permanent
and
satisfactory
basis
the
urgency
of
the
subject
does
not
grow
out
of
any
large
present
demand
for
the
use
of
these
lands
for
agriculture
but
out
of
the
danger
that
the
water
supply
and
the
sites
for
the
necessary
catch
basins
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
individuals
or
private
corporations
and
be
used
to
render
subservient
the
large
areas
dependent
upon
such
supply
the
owner
of
the
water
is
the
owner
of
the
lands
however
the
titles
may
run
all
unappropriated
natural
water
sources
and
all
necessary
reservoir
sites
should
be
held
by
the
government
for
the
equal
use
at
fair
rates
of
the
homestead
settlers
who
will
eventually
take
up
these
lands
the
united
states
should
not
in
my
opinion
undertake
the
construction
of
dams
or
canals
but
should
limit
its
work
to
such
surveys
and
observations
as
will
determine
the
water
supply
both
surface
and
subterranean
the
areas
capable
of
irrigation
and
the
location
and
storage
capacity
of
reservoirs
this
done
the
use
of
the
water
and
of
the
reservoir
sites
might
be
granted
to
the
respective
states
or
territories
or
to
individuals
or
associations
upon
the
condition
that
the
necessary
works
should
be
constructed
and
the
water
furnished
at
fair
rates
without
discrimination
the
rates
to
be
subject
to
supervision
by
the
legislatures
or
by
boards
of
water
commissioners
duly
constituted
the
essential
thing
to
be
secured
is
the
common
and
equal
use
at
fair
rates
of
the
accumulated
water
supply
it
were
almost
better
that
these
lands
should
remain
arid
than
that
those
who
occupy
them
should
become
the
slaves
of
unrestrained
monopolies
controlling
the
one
esse
ntial
element
of
land
values
and
crop
results
the
use
of
the
telegraph
by
the
postoffice
department
as
a
means
for
the
rapid
transmission
of
written
communications
is
i
believe
upon
proper
terms
quite
desirable
the
government
does
not
own
or
operate
the
railroads
and
it
should
not
i
think
own
or
operate
the
telegraph
lines
it
does
however
seem
to
be
quite
practicable
for
the
government
to
contract
with
the
telegraph
companies
as
it
does
with
railroad
companies
to
carry
at
specified
rates
such
communications
as
the
senders
may
designate
for
this
method
of
transmission
i
recommend
that
such
legislation
be
enacted
as
will
enable
the
postoffice
department
fairly
to
test
by
experiment
the
advantages
of
such
a
use
of
the
telegraph
if
any
intelligent
and
loyal
company
of
american
citizens
were
required
to
catalogue
the
essential
human
conditions
of
national
life
i
do
not
doubt
that
with
absolute
unanimity
they
would
begin
with
free
and
honest
elections
and
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
generally
there
is
a
growing
and
nonpartisan
demand
for
better
election
laws
but
against
this
sign
of
hope
and
progress
must
be
set
the
depressing
and
undeniable
fact
that
election
laws
and
methods
are
sometimes
cunningly
contrived
to
secure
minority
control
while
violence
completes
the
shortcomings
of
fraud
in
my
last
annual
message
i
suggested
that
the
development
of
the
existing
law
providing
a
federal
supervision
of
congressional
elections
offered
an
effective
method
of
reforming
these
abuses
the
need
of
such
a
law
has
manifested
itself
in
many
parts
of
the
country
and
its
wholesome
restraints
and
penalties
will
be
useful
in
all
the
constitutionality
of
such
legislation
has
been
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
its
probable
effectiveness
is
evidenced
by
the
character
of
the
opposition
that
is
made
to
it
it
has
been
denounced
as
if
it
were
a
new
exercise
of
federal
power
and
an
invasion
of
the
rights
of
states
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
congress
has
already
fixed
the
time
for
the
election
of
members
of
congress
it
has
declared
that
votes
for
members
of
congress
must
be
by
written
or
printed
ballot
it
has
provided
for
the
appointment
by
the
circuit
courts
in
certain
cases
and
upon
the
petition
of
a
certain
number
of
citizens
of
election
supervisors
and
made
it
their
duty
to
supervise
the
registration
of
voters
conducted
by
the
state
officers
to
challenge
persons
offering
to
register
to
personally
inspect
and
scrutinize
the
registry
lists
and
to
affix
their
names
to
the
lists
for
the
purpose
of
identification
and
the
prevention
of
frauds
to
attend
at
elections
and
remain
with
the
boxes
till
they
are
all
cast
and
counted
to
attach
to
the
registry
lists
and
election
returns
any
statement
touching
the
accuracy
and
fairness
of
the
registry
and
election
and
to
take
and
transmit
to
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives
any
evidence
of
fraudulent
practices
which
may
be
presented
to
them
the
same
law
provides
for
the
appointment
of
deputy
united
states
marshals
to
attend
at
the
polls
support
the
supervisors
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
and
to
arrest
persons
violating
the
election
laws
the
provisions
of
this
familiar
title
of
the
revised
statutes
have
been
put
into
exercise
by
both
the
great
political
parties
and
in
the
north
as
well
as
in
the
south
by
the
filing
with
the
court
of
the
petitions
required
by
the
law
it
is
not
therefore
a
question
whether
we
shall
have
a
federal
election
law
for
we
now
have
one
and
have
had
for
nearly
twenty
years
but
whether
we
shall
have
an
effective
law
the
present
law
stops
just
short
of
effectiveness
for
it
surrenders
to
the
local
authorities
all
control
over
the
certification
which
establishes
the
prima
facie
right
to
a
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
this
defect
should
be
cured
equality
of
representation
and
the
parity
of
the
electors
must
be
maintained
or
everything
that
is
valuable
in
our
system
of
government
is
lost
the
qualifications
of
an
elector
must
be
sought
in
the
law
net
in
the
opinions
prejudices
or
fears
of
any
class
however
powerful
the
path
of
the
elector
to
the
ballot
box
must
be
free
from
the
ambush
of
fear
and
the
enticements
of
fraud
the
count
so
true
and
open
that
none
shall
gainsay
it
such
a
law
should
be
absolutely
nonpartisan
and
impartial
it
should
give
the
advantage
to
honesty
and
the
control
to
majorities
surely
there
is
nothing
sectional
about
this
creed
and
if
it
shall
happen
that
the
penalties
of
laws
intended
to
enforce
these
rights
fall
here
and
not
there
it
is
not
because
the
law
is
sectional
but
because
happily
crime
is
local
and
not
universal
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
every
law
whether
relating
to
elections
or
to
any
other
subject
whether
enacted
by
the
state
or
by
the
nation
has
force
behind
it
the
courts
the
marshal
or
constable
the
posse
comitatus
the
prison
are
all
and
always
behind
the
law
one
can
not
be
justly
charged
with
unfriendliness
to
any
section
or
class
who
seeks
only
to
restrain
violations
of
law
and
of
personal
right
no
community
will
find
lawlessness
profitable
no
community
can
afford
to
have
it
known
that
the
officers
who
are
charged
with
the
preservation
of
the
public
peace
and
the
restraint
of
the
criminal
classes
are
themselves
the
product
of
fraud
or
violence
the
magistrate
is
then
without
respect
and
the
law
without
sanction
the
floods
of
lawlessness
can
not
be
leveed
and
made
to
run
in
one
channel
the
killing
of
a
united
states
marshal
carrying
a
writ
of
arrest
for
an
election
offense
is
full
of
prompting
and
suggestion
to
men
who
are
pursued
by
a
city
marshal
for
a
crime
against
life
or
property
but
it
is
said
that
this
legislation
will
revive
race
animosities
and
some
have
even
suggested
that
when
the
peaceful
methods
of
fraud
are
made
impossible
they
may
be
supplanted
by
intimidation
and
violence
if
the
proposed
law
gives
to
any
qualified
elector
by
a
hairs
weight
more
than
his
equal
influence
or
detracts
by
so
much
from
any
other
qualified
elector
it
is
fatally
impeached
but
if
the
law
is
equal
and
the
animosities
it
is
to
evoke
grow
out
of
the
fact
that
some
electors
have
been
accustomed
to
exercise
the
franchise
for
others
as
well
as
for
themselves
then
these
animosities
ought
not
to
be
confessed
without
shame
and
can
not
be
given
any
weight
in
the
discussion
without
dishonor
no
choice
is
left
to
me
but
to
enforce
with
vigor
all
laws
intended
to
secure
to
the
citizen
his
constitutional
rights
and
to
recommend
that
the
inadequacies
of
such
laws
be
promptly
remedied
if
to
promote
with
zeal
and
ready
interest
every
project
for
the
development
of
its
material
interests
its
rivers
harbors
mines
and
factories
and
the
intelligence
peace
and
security
under
the
law
of
its
communities
and
its
homes
is
not
accepted
as
sufficient
evidence
of
friendliness
to
any
state
or
section
i
can
not
add
connivance
at
election
practices
that
not
only
disturb
local
results
but
rob
the
electors
of
other
states
and
sections
of
their
most
priceless
political
rights
the
preparation
of
the
general
appropriation
bills
should
be
conducted
with
the
greatest
care
and
the
closest
scrutiny
of
expenditures
appropriations
should
be
adequate
to
the
needs
of
the
public
service
but
they
should
be
absolutely
free
from
prodigality
i
venture
again
to
remind
you
that
the
brief
time
remaining
for
the
consideration
of
the
important
legislation
now
awaiting
your
attention
offers
no
margin
for
waste
if
the
present
duty
is
discharged
with
diligence
fidelity
and
courage
the
work
of
the
fiftyfirst
congress
may
be
confidently
submitted
to
the
considerate
judgment
of
the
people
benj
harrison

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
there
are
few
transactions
in
the
administration
of
the
government
that
are
even
temporarily
held
in
the
confidence
of
those
charged
with
the
conduct
of
the
public
business
every
step
taken
is
under
the
observation
of
an
intelligent
and
watchful
people
the
state
of
the
union
is
known
from
day
to
day
and
suggestions
as
to
needed
legislation
find
an
earlier
voice
than
that
which
speaks
in
these
annual
communications
of
the
president
to
congress
good
will
and
cordiality
have
characterized
our
relations
and
correspondence
with
other
governments
and
the
year
just
closed
leaves
few
international
questions
of
importance
remaining
unadjusted
no
obstacle
is
believed
to
exist
that
can
long
postpone
the
consideration
and
adjustment
of
the
still
pending
questions
upon
satisfactory
and
honorable
terms
the
dealings
of
this
government
with
other
states
have
been
and
should
always
be
marked
by
frankness
and
sincerity
our
purposes
avowed
and
our
methods
free
from
intrigue
this
course
has
borne
rich
fruit
in
the
past
and
it
is
our
duty
as
a
nation
to
preserve
the
heritage
of
good
repute
which
a
century
of
right
dealing
with
foreign
governments
has
secured
to
us
it
is
a
matter
of
high
significance
and
no
less
of
congratulation
that
the
first
year
of
the
second
century
of
our
constitutional
existence
finds
as
honored
guests
within
our
borders
the
representatives
of
all
the
independent
states
of
north
and
south
america
met
together
in
earnest
conference
touching
the
best
methods
of
perpetuating
and
expanding
the
relations
of
mutual
interest
and
friendliness
existing
among
them
that
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
for
promoting
closer
international
relations
and
the
increased
prosperity
of
the
states
represented
will
be
used
for
the
mutual
good
of
all
i
can
not
permit
myself
to
doubt
our
people
will
await
with
interest
and
confidence
the
results
to
flow
from
so
auspicious
a
meeting
of
allied
and
in
large
part
identical
interests
the
recommendations
of
this
international
conference
of
enlightened
statesmen
will
doubtless
have
the
considerate
attention
of
congress
and
its
cooperation
in
the
removal
of
unnecessary
barriers
to
beneficial
intercourse
between
the
nations
of
america
but
while
the
commercial
results
which
it
is
hoped
will
follow
this
conference
are
worthy
of
pursuit
and
of
the
great
interests
they
have
excited
it
is
believed
that
the
crowning
benefit
will
be
found
in
the
better
securities
which
may
be
devised
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
among
all
american
nations
and
the
settlement
of
all
contentions
by
methods
that
a
christian
civilization
can
approve
while
viewing
with
interest
our
national
resources
and
products
the
delegates
will
i
am
sure
find
a
higher
satisfaction
in
the
evidences
of
unselfish
friendship
which
everywhere
attend
their
intercourse
with
our
people
another
international
conference
having
great
possibilities
for
good
has
lately
assembled
and
is
now
in
session
in
this
capital
an
invitation
was
extended
by
the
government
under
the
act
of
congress
of
july
to
all
maritime
nations
to
send
delegates
to
confer
touching
the
revision
and
amendment
of
the
rules
and
regulations
governing
vessels
at
sea
and
to
adopt
a
uniform
system
of
marine
signals
the
response
to
this
invitation
has
been
very
general
and
very
cordial
delegates
from
twentysix
nations
are
present
in
the
conference
and
they
have
entered
upon
their
useful
work
with
great
zeal
and
with
an
evident
appreciation
of
its
importance
so
far
as
the
agreement
to
be
reached
may
require
legislation
to
give
it
effect
the
cooperation
of
congress
is
confidently
relied
upon
it
is
an
interesting
if
not
indeed
an
unprecedented
fact
that
the
two
international
conferences
have
brought
together
here
the
accredited
representatives
of
thirtythree
nations
bolivia
ecuador
and
honduras
are
now
represented
by
resident
envoys
of
the
plenipotentiary
grade
all
the
states
of
the
american
system
now
maintain
diplomatic
representation
at
this
capital
in
this
connection
it
may
be
noted
that
all
the
nations
of
the
western
hemisphere
with
one
exception
send
to
washington
envoys
extraordinary
and
ministers
plenipotentiary
being
the
highest
grade
accredited
to
this
government
the
united
states
on
the
contrary
sends
envoys
of
lower
grades
to
some
of
our
sister
republics
our
representative
in
paraguay
and
uruguay
is
a
minister
resident
while
to
bolivia
we
send
a
minister
resident
and
consulgeneral
in
view
of
the
importance
of
our
relations
with
the
states
of
the
american
system
our
diplomatic
agents
in
those
countries
should
be
of
the
uniform
rank
of
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
certain
missions
were
so
elevated
by
the
last
congress
with
happy
effect
and
i
recommend
the
completion
of
the
reform
thus
begun
with
the
inclusion
also
of
hawaii
and
hayti
in
view
of
their
relations
to
the
american
system
of
states
i
also
recommend
that
timely
provision
be
made
for
extending
to
hawaii
an
invitation
to
be
represented
in
the
international
conference
now
sitting
at
this
capital
our
relations
with
china
have
the
attentive
consideration
which
their
magnitude
and
interest
demand
the
failure
of
the
treaty
negotiated
under
the
administration
of
my
predecessor
for
the
further
and
more
complete
restriction
of
chinese
labor
immigration
and
with
it
the
legislation
of
the
last
session
of
congress
dependent
thereon
leaves
some
questions
open
which
congress
should
now
approach
in
that
wise
and
just
spirit
which
should
characterize
the
relations
of
two
great
and
friendly
powers
while
our
supreme
interests
demand
the
exclusion
of
a
laboring
element
which
experience
has
shown
to
be
incompatible
with
our
social
life
all
steps
to
compass
this
imperative
need
should
be
accompanied
with
a
recognition
of
the
claim
of
those
strangers
now
lawfully
among
us
to
humane
and
just
treatment
the
accession
of
the
young
emperor
of
china
marks
we
may
hope
an
era
of
progress
and
prosperity
for
the
great
country
over
which
he
is
called
to
rule
the
present
state
of
affairs
in
respect
to
the
samoan
islands
is
encouraging
the
conference
which
was
held
in
this
city
in
the
summer
of
between
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
germany
and
great
britain
having
been
adjourned
because
of
the
persistent
divergence
of
views
which
was
developed
in
its
deliberations
the
subsequent
course
of
events
in
the
islands
gave
rise
to
questions
of
a
serious
character
on
the
th
of
february
last
the
german
minister
at
this
capital
in
behalf
of
his
government
proposed
a
resumption
of
the
conference
at
berlin
this
proposition
was
accepted
as
congress
in
february
last
was
informed
pursuant
to
the
understanding
thus
reached
commissioners
were
appointed
by
me
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
who
proceeded
to
berlin
where
the
conference
was
renewed
the
deliberations
extended
through
several
weeks
and
resulted
in
the
conclusion
of
a
treaty
which
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
its
approval
i
trust
that
the
efforts
which
have
been
made
to
effect
an
adjustment
of
this
question
will
be
productive
of
the
permanent
establishment
of
law
and
order
in
samoa
upon
the
basis
of
the
maintenance
of
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
natives
as
well
as
of
the
treaty
powers
the
questions
which
have
arisen
during
the
past
few
years
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
are
in
abeyance
or
in
course
of
amicable
adjustment
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
dominion
of
canada
an
effort
has
been
apparent
during
the
season
just
ended
to
administer
the
laws
and
regulations
applicable
to
the
fisheries
with
as
little
occasion
for
friction
as
was
possible
and
the
temperate
representations
of
this
government
in
respect
of
cases
of
undue
hardship
or
of
harsh
interpretations
have
been
in
most
cases
met
with
measures
of
transitory
relief
it
is
trusted
that
the
attainment
of
our
just
rights
under
existing
treaties
and
in
virtue
of
the
concurrent
legislation
of
the
two
contiguous
countries
will
not
be
long
deferred
and
that
all
existing
causes
of
difference
may
be
equitably
adjusted
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
by
an
international
agreement
for
visibly
marking
the
water
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
canada
in
the
narrow
channels
that
join
the
great
lakes
the
conventional
line
therein
traced
by
the
northwestern
boundary
survey
years
ago
is
not
in
all
cases
readily
ascertainable
for
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
questions
a
just
and
acceptable
enlargement
of
the
list
of
offenses
for
which
extradition
may
be
claimed
and
granted
is
most
desirable
between
this
country
and
great
britain
the
territory
of
neither
should
become
a
secure
harbor
for
the
evil
doers
of
the
other
through
any
avoidable
shortcoming
in
this
regard
a
new
treaty
on
this
subject
between
the
two
powers
has
been
recently
negotiated
and
will
soon
be
laid
before
the
senate
the
importance
of
the
commerce
of
cuba
and
puerto
rico
with
the
united
states
their
nearest
and
principal
market
justifies
the
expectation
that
the
existing
relations
may
be
beneficially
expanded
the
impediments
resulting
from
varying
dues
on
navigation
and
from
the
vexatious
treatment
of
our
vessels
on
merely
technical
grounds
of
complaint
in
west
india
ports
should
be
removed
the
progress
toward
an
adjustment
of
pending
claims
between
the
united
states
and
spain
is
not
as
rapid
as
could
be
desired
questions
affecting
american
interests
in
connection
with
railways
constructed
and
operated
by
our
citizens
in
peru
have
claimed
the
attention
of
this
government
it
is
urged
that
other
governments
in
pressing
peru
to
the
payment
of
their
claims
have
disregarded
the
property
rights
of
american
citizens
the
matter
will
be
carefully
investigated
with
a
view
to
securing
a
proper
and
equitable
adjustment
a
similar
issue
is
now
pending
with
portugal
the
delagoa
bay
railway
in
africa
was
constructed
under
a
concession
by
portugal
to
an
american
citizen
when
nearly
completed
the
road
was
seized
by
the
agents
of
the
portuguese
government
formal
protest
has
been
made
throu
gh
our
minister
at
lisbon
against
this
act
and
no
proper
effort
will
be
spared
to
secure
proper
relief
in
pursuance
of
the
charter
granted
by
congress
and
under
the
terms
of
its
contract
with
the
government
of
nicaragua
the
interoceanic
canal
company
has
begun
the
construction
of
the
important
waterway
between
the
two
oceans
which
its
organization
contemplates
grave
complications
for
a
time
seemed
imminent
in
view
of
a
supposed
conflict
of
jurisdiction
between
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
in
regard
to
the
accessory
privileges
to
be
conceded
by
the
latter
republic
toward
the
construction
of
works
on
the
san
juan
river
of
which
the
right
bank
is
costa
rican
territory
i
am
happy
to
learn
that
a
friendly
arrangement
has
been
effected
between
the
two
nations
this
government
has
held
itself
ready
to
promote
in
every
proper
way
the
adjustment
of
all
questions
that
might
present
obstacles
to
the
completion
of
a
work
of
such
transcendent
importance
to
the
commerce
of
this
country
and
indeed
to
the
commercial
interests
of
the
world
the
traditional
good
feeling
between
this
country
and
the
french
republic
has
received
additional
testimony
in
the
participation
of
our
government
and
people
in
the
international
exposition
held
at
paris
during
the
past
summer
the
success
of
our
exhibitors
has
been
gratifying
the
report
of
the
commission
will
be
laid
before
congress
in
due
season
this
government
has
accepted
under
proper
reserve
as
to
its
policy
in
foreign
territories
the
invitation
of
the
government
of
belgium
to
take
part
in
an
international
congress
which
opened
at
brussels
on
the
th
of
november
for
the
purpose
of
devising
measures
to
promote
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
in
africa
and
to
prevent
the
shipment
of
slaves
by
sea
our
interest
in
the
extinction
of
this
crime
against
humanity
in
the
regions
where
it
yet
survives
has
been
increased
by
the
results
of
emancipation
within
our
own
borders
with
germany
the
most
cordial
relations
continue
the
questions
arising
from
the
return
to
the
empire
of
germans
naturalized
in
this
country
are
considered
and
disposed
of
in
a
temperate
spirit
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
both
governments
it
is
a
source
of
great
satisfaction
that
the
internal
disturbances
of
the
republic
of
hayti
are
at
last
happily
ended
and
that
an
apparently
stable
government
has
been
constituted
it
has
been
duly
recognized
by
the
united
states
a
mixed
commission
is
now
in
session
in
this
capital
for
the
settlement
of
longstanding
claims
against
the
republic
of
venezuela
and
it
is
hoped
that
a
satisfactory
conclusion
will
be
speedily
reached
this
government
has
not
hesitated
to
express
its
earnest
desire
that
the
boundary
dispute
now
pending
between
great
britain
and
venezuela
may
be
adjusted
amicably
and
in
strict
accordance
with
the
historic
title
of
the
parties
the
advancement
of
the
empire
of
japan
has
been
evidenced
by
the
recent
promulgation
of
a
new
constitution
containing
valuable
guaranties
of
liberty
and
providing
for
a
responsible
ministry
to
conduct
the
government
it
is
earnestly
recommended
that
our
judicial
rights
and
processes
in
korea
be
established
on
a
firm
basis
by
providing
the
machinery
necessary
to
carry
out
treaty
stipulations
in
that
regard
the
friendliness
of
the
persian
government
continues
to
be
shown
by
its
generous
treatment
of
americans
engaged
in
missionary
labors
and
by
the
cordial
disposition
of
the
shah
to
encourage
the
enterprise
of
our
citizens
in
the
development
of
persian
resources
a
discussion
is
in
progress
touching
the
jurisdictional
treaty
rights
of
the
united
states
in
turkey
an
earnest
effort
will
be
made
to
define
those
rights
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
governments
questions
continue
to
arise
in
our
relations
with
several
countries
in
respect
to
the
rights
of
naturalized
citizens
especially
is
this
the
case
with
france
italy
russia
and
turkey
and
to
a
less
extent
with
switzerland
from
time
to
time
earnest
efforts
have
been
made
to
regulate
this
subject
by
conventions
with
those
countries
an
improper
use
of
naturalization
should
not
be
permitted
but
it
is
most
important
that
those
who
have
been
duly
naturalized
should
everywhere
be
accorded
recognition
of
the
rights
pertaining
to
the
citizenship
of
the
country
of
their
adoption
the
appropriateness
of
special
conventions
for
that
purpose
is
recognized
in
treaties
which
this
government
has
concluded
with
a
number
of
european
states
and
it
is
advisable
that
the
difficulties
which
now
arise
in
our
relations
with
other
countries
on
the
same
subject
should
be
similarly
adjusted
the
recent
revolution
in
brazil
in
favor
of
the
establishment
of
a
republican
form
of
government
is
an
event
of
great
interest
to
the
united
states
our
minister
at
rio
de
janeiro
was
at
once
instructed
to
maintain
friendly
diplomatic
relations
with
the
provisional
government
and
the
brazilian
representatives
at
this
capital
were
instructed
by
the
provisional
government
to
continue
their
functions
our
friendly
intercourse
with
brazil
has
therefore
suffered
no
interruption
our
minister
has
been
further
instructed
to
extend
on
the
part
of
this
government
a
formal
and
cordial
recognition
of
the
new
republic
so
soon
as
the
majority
of
the
people
of
brazil
shall
have
signified
their
assent
to
its
establishment
and
maintenance
within
our
own
borders
a
general
condition
of
prosperity
prevails
the
harvests
of
the
last
summer
were
exceptionally
abundant
and
the
trade
conditions
now
prevailing
seem
to
promise
a
successful
season
to
the
merchant
and
the
manufacturer
and
general
employment
to
our
working
people
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
has
been
prepared
and
will
be
presented
to
congress
it
presents
with
clearness
the
fiscal
operations
of
the
government
and
i
avail
myself
of
it
to
obtain
some
facts
for
use
here
the
aggregate
receipts
from
all
sources
for
the
year
were
derived
as
follows
from
customs
from
internal
revenue
from
miscellaneous
sources
the
ordinary
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
and
the
total
expenditures
including
the
sinking
fund
were
the
excess
of
receipts
over
expenditures
was
after
providing
for
the
sinking
fund
for
the
current
fiscal
year
the
total
revenues
actual
and
estimated
are
and
the
ordinary
expenditures
actual
and
estimated
are
making
with
the
sinking
fund
a
total
expenditure
of
leaving
an
estimated
surplus
of
during
the
fiscal
year
there
was
applied
to
the
purchase
of
bonds
in
addition
to
those
for
the
sinking
fund
and
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
current
year
the
sum
of
all
of
which
were
credited
to
the
sinking
fund
the
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
estimated
by
the
treasury
department
at
and
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
including
the
sinking
fund
at
this
shows
an
estimated
surplus
for
that
year
of
which
is
more
likely
to
be
increased
than
reduced
when
the
actual
transactions
are
written
up
the
existence
of
so
large
an
actual
and
anticipated
surplus
should
have
the
immediate
attention
of
congress
with
a
view
to
reducing
the
receipts
of
the
treasury
to
the
needs
of
the
government
as
closely
as
may
be
the
collection
of
moneys
not
needed
for
public
uses
imposes
an
unnecessary
burden
upon
our
people
and
the
presence
of
so
large
a
surplus
in
the
public
vaults
is
a
disturbing
element
in
the
conduct
of
private
business
it
has
called
into
use
expedients
for
putting
it
into
circulation
of
very
questionable
propriety
we
should
not
collect
revenue
for
the
purpose
of
anticipating
our
bonds
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
sinking
fund
but
any
unappropriated
surplus
in
the
treasury
should
be
so
used
as
there
is
no
other
lawful
way
of
returning
the
money
to
circulation
and
the
profit
realized
by
the
government
offers
a
substantial
advantage
the
loaning
of
public
funds
to
the
banks
without
interest
upon
the
security
of
government
bonds
i
regard
as
an
unauthorized
and
dangerous
expedient
it
results
in
a
temporary
and
unnatural
increase
of
the
banking
capital
of
favored
localities
and
compels
a
cautious
and
gradual
recall
of
the
deposits
to
avoid
injury
to
the
commercial
interests
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
the
banks
having
these
deposits
will
sell
their
bonds
to
the
treasury
so
long
as
the
present
highly
beneficial
arrangement
is
continued
they
now
practically
get
interest
both
upon
the
bonds
and
their
proceeds
no
further
use
should
be
made
of
this
method
of
getting
the
surplus
into
circulation
and
the
deposits
now
outstanding
should
be
gradually
withdrawn
and
applied
to
the
purchase
of
bonds
it
is
fortunate
that
such
a
use
can
be
made
of
the
existing
surplus
and
for
some
time
to
come
of
any
casual
surplus
that
may
exist
after
congress
has
taken
the
necessary
steps
for
a
reduction
of
the
revenue
such
legislation
should
be
promptly
but
very
considerately
enacted
i
recommend
a
revision
of
our
tariff
law
both
in
its
administrative
features
and
in
the
schedules
the
need
of
the
former
is
generally
conceded
and
an
agreement
upon
the
evils
and
inconveniences
to
be
remedied
and
the
best
methods
for
their
correction
will
probably
not
be
difficult
uniformity
of
valuation
at
all
our
ports
is
essential
and
effective
measures
should
be
taken
to
secure
it
it
is
equally
desirable
that
questions
affecting
rates
and
classifications
should
be
promptly
decided
the
preparation
of
a
new
schedule
of
customs
duties
is
a
matter
of
great
delicacy
because
of
its
direct
effect
upon
the
business
of
the
country
and
of
great
difficulty
by
reason
of
the
wide
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
the
objects
that
may
properly
be
promoted
by
such
legislation
some
disturbance
of
business
may
perhaps
result
from
the
consideration
of
this
subject
by
congress
but
this
temporary
ill
effect
will
be
reduced
to
the
minimum
by
prompt
action
and
by
the
assurance
which
the
country
already
enjoys
that
any
necessary
changes
will
be
so
made
as
not
to
impair
the
just
and
reasonable
protection
of
our
home
industries
the
inequalities
of
the
law
should
be
adjusted
but
the
protective
principle
should
be
maintained
and
fairly
app
lied
to
the
products
of
our
farms
as
well
as
of
our
shops
these
duties
necessarily
have
relation
to
other
things
besides
the
public
revenues
we
can
not
limit
their
effects
by
fixing
our
eyes
on
the
public
treasury
alone
they
have
a
direct
relation
to
home
production
to
work
to
wages
and
to
the
commercial
independence
of
our
country
and
the
wise
and
patriotic
legislator
should
enlarge
the
field
of
his
vision
to
include
all
of
these
the
necessary
reduction
in
our
public
revenues
can
i
am
sure
be
made
without
making
the
smaller
burden
more
onerous
than
the
larger
by
reason
of
the
disabilities
and
limitations
which
the
process
of
reduction
puts
upon
both
capital
and
labor
the
free
list
can
very
safely
be
extended
by
placing
thereon
articles
that
do
not
offer
injurious
competition
to
such
domestic
products
as
our
home
labor
can
supply
the
removal
of
the
internal
tax
upon
tobacco
would
relieve
an
important
agricultural
product
from
a
burden
which
was
imposed
only
because
our
revenue
from
customs
duties
was
insufficient
for
the
public
needs
if
safe
provision
against
fraud
can
be
devised
the
removal
of
the
tax
upon
spirits
used
in
the
arts
and
in
manufactures
would
also
offer
an
unobjectionable
method
of
reducing
the
surplus
a
table
presented
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
showing
the
amount
of
money
of
all
kinds
in
circulation
each
year
from
to
the
present
time
is
of
interest
it
appears
that
the
amount
of
nationalbank
notes
in
circulation
has
decreased
during
that
period
of
which
is
chargeable
to
the
last
year
the
withdrawal
of
bank
circulation
will
necessarily
continue
under
existing
conditions
it
is
probable
that
the
adoption
of
the
suggestions
made
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
namely
that
the
minimum
deposit
of
bonds
for
the
establishment
of
banks
be
reduced
and
that
an
issue
of
notes
to
the
par
value
of
the
bonds
be
allowed
would
help
to
maintain
the
bank
circulation
but
while
this
withdrawal
of
bank
notes
has
been
going
on
there
has
been
a
large
increase
in
the
amount
of
gold
and
silver
coin
in
circulation
and
in
the
issues
of
gold
and
silver
certificates
the
total
amount
of

of
all
kinds

on

of
grains
has
been
observed
by
the
department
but
neither
the
present
secretary
nor
any
of
his
predecessors
has
deemed
it
safe
to
exercise
the
discretion
given
by
law
to
increase
the
monthly
purchases
to
when
the
law
was
enacted

the

dollar
was
cents
the
evil
anticipations
which
have
accompanied
the
coinage
and
use
of
the
silver
dollar
have
not
been
realized
as
a
coin
it
has
not
had
general
use
and
the
public
treasury
has
been
compelled
to
store
it
but
this
is
manifestly
owing
to
the
fact
that
its
paper
representative
is
more
convenient
the
general
acceptance
and
the
use
of
the
silver
certificate
show
that
silver
has
not
been
otherwise
discredited
some
favorable
conditions
have
contributed
to
maintain
this
practical
equality
in
their
commercial
use
between
the
gold
and
silver
dollars
but
some
of
these
are
trade
conditions
that
statutory
enactments
do
not
control
and
of
the
continuance
of
which
we
can
not
be
certain
i
think
it
is
clear
that
if
we
should
make
the
coinage
of
silver
at
the
present
ratio
free
we
must
expect
that
the
difference
in
the
bullion
values
of
the
gold
and
silver
dollars
will
be
taken
account
of
in
commercial
transactions
and
i
fear
the
same
result
would
follow
any
considerable
increase
of
the
present
rate
of
coinage
such
a
result
would
be
discreditable
to
our
financial
management
and
disastrous
to
all
business
interests
we
should
not
tread
the
dangerous
edge
of
such
a
peril
and
indeed
nothing
more
harmful
could
happen
to
the
silver
interests
any
safe
legislation
upon
this
subject
must
secure
the
equality
of
the
two
coins
in
their
commercial
uses
i
have
always
been
an
advocate
of
the
use
of
silver
in
our
currency
we
are
large
producers
of
that
metal
and
should
not
discredit
it
to
the
plan
which
will
be
presented
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
the
issuance
of
notes
or
certificates
upon
the
deposit
of
silver
bullion
at
its
market
value
i
have
been
able
to
give
only
a
hasty
examination
owing
to
the
press
of
other
matters
and
to
the
fact
that
it
has
been
so
recently
formulated
the
details
of
such
a
law
require
careful
consideration
but
the
general
plan
suggested
by
him
seems
to
satisfy
the
purposeto
continue
the
use
of
silver
in
connection
with
our
currency
and
at
the
same
time
to
obviate
the
danger
of
which
i
have
spoken
at
a
later
day
i
may
communicate
further
with
congress
upon
this
subject
the
enforcement
of
the
chinese
exclusion
act
has
been
found
to
be
very
difficult
on
the
northwestern
frontier
chinamen
landing
at
victoria
find
it
easy
to
pass
our
border
owing
to
the
impossibility
with
the
force
at
the
command
of
the
customs
officers
of
guarding
so
long
an
inland
line
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
authorized
the
employment
of
additional
officers
who
will
be
assigned
to
this
duty
and
every
effort
will
be
made
to
enforce
the
law
the
dominion
exacts
a
head
tax
of
for
each
chinaman
landed
and
when
these
persons
in
fraud
of
our
law
cross
into
our
territory
and
are
apprehended
our
officers
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
as
the
dominion
authorities
will
not
suffer
them
to
be
sent
back
without
a
second
payment
of
the
tax
an
effort
will
be
made
to
reach
an
understanding
that
will
remove
this
difficulty
the
proclamation
required
by
section
of
the
act
of
march
relating
to
the
killing
of
seals
and
other
furbearing
animals
was
issued
by
me
on
the
st
day
of
march
and
a
revenue
vessel
was
dispatched
to
enforce
the
laws
and
protect
the
interests
of
the
united
states
the
establishment
of
a
refuge
station
at
point
barrow
as
directed
by
congress
was
successfully
accomplished
judged
by
modern
standards
we
are
practically
without
coast
defenses
many
of
the
structures
we
have
would
enhance
rather
than
diminish
the
perils
of
their
garrisons
if
subjected
to
the
fire
of
improved
guns
and
very
few
are
so
located
as
to
give
full
effect
to
the
greater
range
of
such
guns
as
we
are
now
making
for
coastdefense
uses
this
general
subject
has
had
consideration
in
congress
for
some
years
and
the
appropriation
for
the
construction
of
large
rifled
guns
made
one
year
ago
was
i
am
sure
the
expression
of
a
purpose
to
provide
suitable
works
in
which
these
guns
might
be
mounted
an
appropriation
now
made
for
that
purpose
would
not
advance
the
completion
of
the
works
beyond
our
ability
to
supply
them
with
fairly
effective
guns
the
security
of
our
coast
cities
against
foreign
attacks
should
not
rest
altogether
in
the
friendly
disposition
of
other
nations
there
should
be
a
second
line
wholly
in
our
own
keeping
i
very
urgently
recommend
an
appropriation
at
this
session
for
the
construction
of
such
works
in
our
most
exposed
harbors
i
approve
the
suggestion
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
provision
be
made
for
encamping
companies
of
the
national
guard
in
our
coast
works
for
a
specified
time
each
year
and
for
their
training
in
the
use
of
heavy
guns
his
suggestion
that
an
increase
of
the
artillery
force
of
the
army
is
desirable
is
also
in
this
connection
commended
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
improvement
of
our
important
rivers
and
harbors
should
be
promoted
by
the
necessary
appropriations
care
should
be
taken
that
the
government
is
not
committed
to
the
prosecution
of
works
not
of
public
and
general
advantage
and
that
the
relative
usefulness
of
works
of
that
class
is
not
overlooked
so
far
as
this
work
can
ever
be
said
to
be
completed
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
end
would
be
sooner
and
more
economically
reached
if
fewer
separate
works
were
undertaken
at
the
same
time
and
those
selected
for
their
greater
general
interest
were
more
rapidly
pushed
to
completion
a
work
once
considerably
begun
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
risks
and
deterioration
which
interrupted
or
insufficient
appropriations
necessarily
occasion
the
assault
made
by
david
s
terry
upon
the
person
of
justice
field
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
at
lathtop
cal
in
august
last
and
the
killing
of
the
assailant
by
a
deputy
united
states
marshal
who
had
been
deputed
to
accompany
justice
field
and
to
protect
him
from
anticipated
violence
at
the
hands
of
terry
in
connection
with
the
legal
proceedings
which
have
followed
suggest
questions
which
in
my
judgment
are
worthy
of
the
attention
of
congress
i
recommend
that
more
definite
provision
be
made
by
law
not
only
for
the
protection
of
federal
officers
but
for
a
full
trial
of
such
cases
in
the
united
states
courts
in
recommending
such
legislation
i
do
not
at
all
impeach
either
the
general
adequacy
of
the
provision
made
by
the
state
laws
for
the
protection
of
all
citizens
or
the
general
good
disposition
of
those
charged
with
the
execution
of
such
laws
to
give
protection
to
the
officers
of
the
united
states
the
duty
of
protecting
its
officers
as
such
and
of
punishing
those
who
assault
t
hem
on
account
of
their
official
acts
should
not
be
devolved
expressly
or
by
acquiescence
upon
the
local
authorities
events
which
have
been
brought
to
my
attention
happening
in
other
parts
of
the
country
have
also
suggested
the
propriety
of
extending
by
legislation
fuller
protection
to
those
who
may
be
called
as
witnesses
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
the
law
compels
those
who
are
supposed
to
have
knowledge
of
public
offenses
to
attend
upon
our
courts
and
grand
juries
and
to
give
evidence
there
is
a
manifest
resulting
duty
that
these
witnesses
shall
be
protected
from
injury
on
account
of
their
testimony
the
investigations
of
criminal
offenses
are
often
rendered
futile
and
the
punishment
of
crime
impossible
by
the
intimidation
of
witnesses
the
necessity
of
providing
some
more
speedy
method
for
disposing
of
the
cases
which
now
come
for
final
adjudication
to
the
supreme
court
becomes
every
year
more
apparent
and
urgent
the
plan
of
providing
some
intermediate
courts
having
final
appellate
jurisdiction
of
certain
classes
of
questions
and
cases
has
i
think
received
a
more
general
approval
from
the
bench
and
bar
of
the
country
than
any
other
without
attempting
to
discuss
details
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
the
establishment
of
such
courts
the
salaries
of
the
judges
of
the
district
courts
in
many
of
the
districts
are
in
my
judgment
inadequate
i
recommend
that
all
such
salaries
now
below
per
annum
be
increased
to
that
amount
it
is
quite
true
that
the
amount
of
labor
performed
by
these
judges
is
very
unequal
but
as
they
can
not
properly
engage
in
other
pursuits
to
supplement
their
incomes
the
salary
should
be
such
in
all
cases
as
to
provide
an
independent
and
comfortable
support
earnest
attention
should
be
given
by
congress
to
a
consideration
of
the
question
how
far
the
restraint
of
those
combinations
of
capital
commonly
called
trusts
is
matter
of
federal
jurisdiction
when
organized
as
they
often
are
to
crush
out
all
healthy
competition
and
to
monopolize
the
production
or
sale
of
an
article
of
commerce
and
general
necessity
they
are
dangerous
conspiracies
against
the
public
good
and
should
be
made
the
subject
of
prohibitory
and
even
penal
legislation
the
subject
of
an
international
copyright
has
been
frequently
commended
to
the
attention
of
congress
by
my
predecessors
the
enactment
of
such
a
law
would
be
eminently
wise
and
just
our
naturalization
laws
should
be
so
revised
as
to
make
the
inquiry
into
the
moral
character
and
good
disposition
toward
our
government
of
the
persons
applying
for
citizenship
more
thorough
this
can
only
be
done
by
taking
fuller
control
of
the
examination
by
fixing
the
times
for
hearing
such
applications
and
by
requiring
the
presence
of
some
one
who
shall
represent
the
government
in
the
inquiry
those
who
are
the
avowed
enemies
of
social
order
or
who
come
to
our
shores
to
swell
the
injurious
influence
and
to
extend
the
evil
practices
of
any
association
that
defies
our
laws
should
not
only
be
denied
citizenship
but
a
domicile
the
enactment
of
a
national
bankrupt
law
of
a
character
to
be
a
permanent
part
of
our
general
legislation
is
desirable
it
should
be
simple
in
its
methods
and
inexpensive
in
its
administration
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
not
only
exhibits
the
operations
of
the
department
for
the
last
fiscal
year
but
contains
many
valuable
suggestions
for
the
improvement
and
extension
of
the
service
which
are
commended
to
your
attention
no
other
branch
of
the
government
has
so
close
a
contact
with
the
daily
life
of
the
people
almost
everyone
uses
the
service
it
offers
and
every
hour
gained
in
the
transmission
of
the
great
commercial
mails
has
an
actual
and
possible
value
that
only
those
engaged
in
trade
can
understand
the
saving
of
one
day
in
the
transmission
of
the
mails
between
new
york
and
san
francisco
which
has
recently
been
accomplished
is
an
incident
worthy
of
mention
the
plan
suggested
of
a
supervision
of
the
postoffices
in
separate
districts
that
shall
involve
instruction
and
suggestion
and
a
rating
of
the
efficiency
of
the
postmasters
would
i
have
no
doubt
greatly
improve
the
service
a
pressing
necessity
exists
for
the
erection
of
a
building
for
the
joint
use
of
the
department
and
of
the
city
postoffice
the
department
was
partially
relieved
by
renting
outside
quarters
for
a
part
of
its
force
but
it
is
again
overcrowded
the
building
used
by
the
city
office
never
was
fit
for
the
purpose
and
is
now
inadequate
and
unwholesome
the
unsatisfactory
condition
of
the
law
relating
to
the
transmission
through
the
mails
of
lottery
advertisements
and
remittances
is
clearly
stated
by
the
postmastergeneral
and
his
suggestion
as
to
amendments
should
have
your
favorable
consideration
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
a
reorganization
of
the
bureaus
of
the
department
that
will
i
do
not
doubt
promote
the
efficiency
of
each
in
general
satisfactory
progress
has
been
made
in
the
construction
of
the
new
ships
of
war
authorized
by
congress
the
first
vessel
of
the
new
navy
the
dolphin
was
subjected
to
very
severe
trial
tests
and
to
very
much
adverse
criticism
but
it
is
gratifying
to
be
able
to
state
that
a
cruise
around
the
world
from
which
she
has
recently
returned
has
demonstrated
that
she
is
a
firstclass
vessel
of
her
rate
the
report
of
the
secretary
shows
that
while
the
effective
force
of
the
navy
is
rapidly
increasing
by
reason
of
the
improved
build
and
armament
of
the
new
ships
the
number
of
our
ships
fit
for
sea
duty
grows
very
slowly
we
had
on
the
th
of
march
last
serviceable
ships
and
though
have
since
been
added
to
the
list
the
total
has
not
been
increased
because
in
the
meantime
have
been
lost
or
condemned
twentysix
additional
vessels
have
been
authorized
and
appropriated
for
but
it
is
probable
that
when
they
are
completed
our
list
will
only
be
increased
to
a
gain
of
the
old
wooden
ships
are
disappearing
almost
as
fast
as
the
new
vessels
are
added
these
facts
carry
their
own
argument
one
of
the
new
ships
may
in
fighting
strength
be
equal
to
two
of
the
old
but
it
can
not
do
the
cruising
duty
of
two
it
is
important
therefore
that
we
should
have
a
more
rapid
increase
in
the
number
of
serviceable
ships
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
that
the
construction
of
armored
ships
gunboats
and
torpedo
boats
be
authorized
an
appalling
calamity
befell
three
of
our
naval
vessels
on
duty
at
the
samoan
islands
in
the
harbor
of
apia
in
march
last
involving
the
loss
of
officers
and
seamen
of
two
vessels
the
trenton
and
the
vandalia
and
the
disabling
of
a
third
the
nipsic
three
vessels
of
the
german
navy
also
in
the
harbor
shared
with
our
ships
the
force
of
the
hurricane
and
suffered
even
more
heavily
while
mourning
the
brave
officers
and
men
who
died
facing
with
high
resolve
perils
greater
than
those
of
battle
it
is
most
gratifying
to
state
that
the
credit
of
the
american
navy
for
seamanship
courage
and
generosity
was
magnificently
sustained
in
the
stormbeaten
harbor
of
apia
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
exhibits
the
transactions
of
the
government
with
the
indian
tribes
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
the
education
of
the
children
of
school
age
and
in
the
allotment
of
lands
to
adult
indians
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
policy
of
breaking
up
the
tribal
relation
and
of
dealing
with
the
indian
as
an
individual
did
not
appear
earlier
in
our
legislation
large
reservations
held
in
common
and
the
maintenance
of
the
authority
of
the
chiefs
and
headmen
have
deprived
the
individual
of
every
incentive
to
the
exercise
of
thrift
and
the
annuity
has
contributed
an
affirmative
impulse
toward
a
state
of
confirmed
pauperism
our
treaty
stipulations
should
be
observed
with
fidelity
and
our
legislation
should
be
highly
considerate
of
the
best
interests
of
an
ignorant
and
helpless
people
the
reservations
are
now
generally
surrounded
by
white
settlements
we
can
no
longer
push
the
indian
back
into
the
wilderness
and
it
remains
only
by
every
suitable
agency
to
push
him
upward
into
the
estate
of
a
selfsupporting
and
responsible
citizen
for
the
adult
the
first
step
is
to
locate
him
upon
a
farm
and
for
the
child
to
place
him
in
a
school
school
attendance
should
be
promoted
by
every
moral
agency
and
those
failing
should
be
compelled
the
national
schools
for
indians
have
been
very
successful
and
should
be
multiplied
and
as
far
as
possible
should
be
so
organized
and
conducted
as
to
facilitate
the
transfer
of
the
schools
to
the
states
or
territories
in
which
they
are
located
when
the
indians
in
a
neighborhood
have
accepted
citizenship
and
have
become
otherwise
fitted
for
such
a
transfer
this
condition
of
things
will
be
attained
slowly
but
it
will
be
hastened
by
keeping
it
in
mind
and
in
the
meantime
that
cooperation
between
the
government
and
the
mission
schools
which
has
wrought
much
good
should
be
cordially
and
impartially
maintained
the
last
congress
enacted
two
distinct
laws
relating
to
negotiations
with
the
sioux
indians
of
dakota
for
a
relinquishment
of
a
portion
of
their
lands
to
the
united
states
and
for
dividing
the
remainder
into
separate
reservations
both
were
approved
on
the
same
daymarch
the
one
submitted
to
the
indians
a
specific
proposition
the
other
section
of
the
indian
appropriation
act
authorized
the
president
to

was
prevented
by
ill
health
from
taking

in

his
death
which
occurred

is
justly
and
generally
lamented
by
a
people
he
had
served
with
conspicuous
gallantry
in
war
and
with
great
fidelity
in

the
vacancy
thus
created
was
filled
by

a
second
conference
between
the
commission
and
the
cherokees
was
begun
november
but
no
results
have
yet
been
obtained
nor
is
it
believed
that
a
conclusion
can
be
immediately
expected
the
cattle
syndicate
now
occupying
the
lands
for
grazing
purposes
is
clearly
one
of
the
agencies
responsible
for
the
obstruction
of
our
negotiations
with
the
cherokees
the
large
body
of
agricultural
lands
constituting
what
is
known
as
the
cherokee
outlet
ought
not
to
be
and
indeed
can
not
long
be
held
for
grazing
and
for
the
advantage
of
a
few
against
the
public
interests
and
the
best
advantage
of
the
indians
themselves
the
united
states
has
now
under
the
treaties
certain
rights
in
these
lands
these
will
not
be
used
oppressively
but
it
can
not
be
allowed
that
those
who
by
sufferance
occupy
these
lands
shall
interpose
to
defeat
the
wise
and
beneficent
purposes
of
the
government
i
can
not
but
believe
that
the
advantageous
character
of
the
offer
made
by
the
united
states
to
the
cherokee
nation
for
a
full
release
of
these
lands
as
compared
with
other
suggestions
now
made
to
them
will
yet
obtain
for
it
a
favorable
consideration
under
the
agreement
made
between
the
united
states
and
the
muscogee
or
creek
nation
of
indians
on
the
th
day
of
january
an
absolute
title
was
secured
by
the
united
states
to
about
acres
of
land
section
of
the
general
indian
appropriation
act
approved
march
made
provision
for
the
purchase
by
the
united
states
from
the
seminole
tribe
of
a
certain
portion
of
their
lands
the
delegates
of
the
seminole
nation
having
first
duly
evidenced
to
me
their
power
to
act
in
that
behalf
delivered
a
proper
release
or
conveyance
to
the
united
states
of
all
the
lands
mentioned
in
the
act
which
was
accepted
by
me
and
certified
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
statute
by
the
terms
of
both
the
acts
referred
to
all
the
lands
so
purchased
were
declared
to
be
a
part
of
the
public
domain
and
open
to
settlement
under
the
homestead
law
but
of
the
lands
embraced
in
these
purchases
being
in
the
aggregate
about
acres
acres
had
already
under
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
been
acquired
by
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
settling
other
indian
tribes
thereon
and
had
been
appropriated
to
that
purpose
the
land
remaining
and
available
for
settlement
consisted
of
acres
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
lands
in
the
occupancy
of
indian
tribes
congress
had
provided
no
civil
government
for
the
people
who
were
to
be
invited
by
my
proclamation
to
settle
upon
these
lands
except
as
the
new
court
which
had
been
established
at
muscogee
or
the
united
states
courts
in
some
of
the
adjoining
states
had
power
to
enforce
the
general
laws
of
the
united
states
in
this
condition
of
things
i
was
quite
reluctant
to
open
the
lands
to
settlement
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
several
thousand
persons
many
of
them
with
their
families
had
gathered
upon
the
borders
of
the
indian
territory
with
a
view
to
securing
homesteads
on
the
ceded
lands
and
that
delay
would
involve
them
in
much
loss
and
suffering
i
did
on
the
d
day
of
march
last
issue
a
proclamation
declaring
that
the
lands
therein
described
would
be
open
to
settlement
under
the
provisions
of
the
law
on
the
d
day
of
april
following
at
oclock
noon
two
land
districts
had
been
established
and
the
offices
were
opened
for
the
transaction
of
business
when
the
appointed
time
arrived
it
is
much
to
the
credit
of
the
settlers
that
they
very
generally
observed
the
limitation
as
to
the
time
when
they
might
enter
the
territory
care
will
be
taken
that
those
who
entered
in
violation
of
the
law
do
not
secure
the
advantage
they
unfairly
sought
there
was
a
good
deal
of
apprehension
that
the
strife
for
locations
would
result
in
much
violence
and
bloodshed
but
happily
these
anticipations
were
not
realized
it
is
estimated
that
there
are
now
in
the
territory
about
people
and
several
considerable
towns
have
sprung
up
for
which
temporary
municipal
governments
have
been
organized
guthrie
is
said
to
have
now
a
population
of
almost
eleven
schools
and
nine
churches
have
been
established
and
three
daily
and
five
weekly
newspapers
are
published
in
this
city
whose
charter
and
ordinances
have
only
the
sanction
of
the
voluntary
acquiescence
of
the
people
from
day
to
day
oklahoma
city
has
a
population
of
about
and
is
proportionately
as
well
provided
as
guthrie
with
churches
schools
and
newspapers
other
towns
and
villages
having
populations
of
from
to
are
scattered
over
the
territory
in
order
to
secure
the
peace
of
this
new
community
in
the
absence
of
civil
government
i
directed
general
merritt
commanding
the
department
of
the
missouri
to
act
in
conjunction
with
the
marshals
of
the
united
states
to
preserve
the
peace
and
upon
their
requisition
to
use
the
troops
to
aid
them
in
executing
warrants
and
in
quieting
any
riots
or
breaches
of
the
peace
that
might
occur
he
was
further
directed
to
use
his
influence
to
promote
good
order
and
to
avoid
any
conflicts
between
or
with
the
settlers
believing
that
the
introduction
and
sale
of
liquors
where
no
legal
restraints
or
regulations
existed
would
endanger
the
public
peace
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
such
liquors
must
first
be
introduced
into
the
indian
reservations
before
reaching
the
white
settlements
i
further
directed
the
general
commanding
to
enforce
the
laws
relating
to
the
introduction
of
ardent
spirits
into
the
indian
country
the
presence
of
the
troops
has
given
a
sense
of
security
to
the
welldisposed
citizens
and
has
tended
to
restrain
the
lawless
in
one
instance
the
officer
in
immediate
command
of
the
troops
went
further
than
i
deemed
justifiable
in
supporting
the
de
facto
municipal
government
of
guthrie
and
he
was
so
informed
and
directed
to
limit
the
interference
of
the
military
to
the
support
of
the
marshals
on
the
lines
indicated
in
the
original
order
i
very
urgently
recommend
that
congress
at
once
provide
a
territorial
government
for
these
people
serious
questions
which
may
at
any
time
lead
to
violent
outbreaks
are
awaiting
the
institution
of
courts
for
their
peaceful
adjustment
the
american
genius
for
selfgovernment
has
been
well
illustrated
in
oklahoma
but
it
is
neither
safe
nor
wise
to
leave
these
people
longer
to
the
expedients
which
have
temporarily
served
them
provision
should
be
made
for
the
acquisition
of
title
to
town
lots
in
the
towns
now
established
in
alaska
for
locating
town
sites
and
for
the
establishment
of
municipal
governments
only
the
mining
laws
have
been
extended
to
that
territory
and
no
other
form
of
title
to
lands
can
now
be
obtained
the
general
land
laws
were
framed
with
reference
to
the
disposition
of
agricultural
lands
and
it
is
doubtful
if
their
operation
in
alaska
would
be
beneficial
we
have
fortunately
not
extended
to
alaska
the
mistaken
policy
of
establishing
reservations
for
the
indian
tribes
and
can
deal
with
them
from
the
beginning
as
individuals
with
i
am
sure
better
results
but
any
disposition
of
the
public
lands
and
any
regulations
relating
to
timber
and
to
the
fisheries
should
have
a
kindly
regard
to
their
interests
having
no
power
to
levy
taxes
the
people
of
alaska
are
wholly
dependent
upon
the
general
government
to
whose
revenues
the
seal
fisheries
make
a
large
annual
contribution
an
appropriation
for
education
should
neither
be
overlooked
nor
stinted
the
smallness
of
the
population
and
the
great
distances
between
the
settlements
offer
serious
obstacles
to
the
establishment
of
the
usual
territorial
form
of
government
perhaps
the
organization
of
several
subdistricts
with
a
small
municipal
council
of
limited
powers
for
each
would
be
safe
and
useful
attention
is
called
in
this
connection
to
the
suggestions
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
relating
to
the
establishment
of
another
port
of
entry
in
alaska
and
of
other
needed
customs
facilities
and
regulations
in
the
administration
of
the
land
laws
the
policy
of
facilitating
in
every
proper
way
the
adjustment
of
the
honest
claims
of
individual
settlers
upon
the
public
lands
has
been
pursued
the
number
of
pending
cases
had
during
the
preceding
administration
been
greatly
increased
under
the
operation
of
orders
for
a
time
suspending
final
action
in
a
large
part
of
the
cases
originating
in
the
west
and
northwest
and
by
the
subsequent
use
of
unusual
methods
of
examination
only
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
conditions
under
which
our
agricultural
lands
have
been
settled
can
appreciate
the
serious
and
often
fatal
consequences
to
the
settler
of
a
policy
that
puts
his
title
under
suspicion
or
delays
the
issuance
of
his
patent
while
care
is
taken
to
prevent
and
to
expose
fraud
it
should
not
be
imputed
without
reason
the
manifest
purpose
of
the
homestead
and
preemption
laws
was
to
promote
the
settlement
of
the
public
domain
by
persons
having
a
bona
fi
de
intent
to
make
a
home
upon
the
selected
lands
where
this
intent
is
well
established
and
the
requirements
of
the
law
have
been
substantially
complied
with
the
claimant
is
entitled
to
a
prompt
and
friendly
consideration
of
his
case
but
where
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
claimant
is
the
mere
agent
of
another
who
is
seeking
to
evade
a
law
intended
to
promote
small
holdings
and
to
secure
by
fraudulent
methods
large
tracts
of
timber
and
other
lands
both
principal
and
agent
should
not
only
be
thwarted
in
their
fraudulent
purpose
but
should
be
made
to
feel
the
full
penalties
of
our
criminal
statutes
the
laws
should
be
so
administered
as
not
to
confound
these
two
classes
and
to
visit
penalties
only
upon
the
latter
the
unsettled
state
of
the
titles
to
large
bodies
of
lands
in
the
territories
of
new
mexico
and
arizona
has
greatly
retarded
the
development
of
those
territories
provision
should
be
made
by
law
for
the
prompt
trial
and
final
adjustment
before
a
judicial
tribunal
or
commission
of
all
claims
based
upon
mexican
grants
it
is
not
just
to
an
intelligent
and
enterprising
people
that
their
peace
should
be
disturbed
and
their
prosperity
retarded
by
these
old
contentions
i
express
the
hope
that
differences
of
opinion
as
to
methods
may
yield
to
the
urgency
of
the
case
the
law
now
provides
a
pension
for
every
soldier
and
sailor
who
was
mustered
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
during
the
civil
war
and
is
now
suffering
from
wounds
or
disease
having
an
origin
in
the
service
and
in
the
line
of
duty
two
of
the
three
necessary
facts
viz
muster
and
disability
are
usually
susceptible
of
easy
proof
but
the
third
origin
in
the
service
is
often
difficult
and
in
many
deserving
cases
impossible
to
establish
that
very
many
of
those
who
endured
the
hardships
of
our
most
bloody
and
arduous
campaigns
are
now
disabled
from
diseases
that
had
a
real
but
not
traceable
origin
in
the
service
i
do
not
doubt
besides
these
there
is
another
class
composed
of
men
many
of
whom
served
an
enlistment
of
three
full
years
and
of
reenlisted
veterans
who
added
a
fourth
year
of
service
who
escaped
the
casualties
of
battle
and
the
assaults
of
disease
who
were
always
ready
for
any
detail
who
were
in
every
battle
line
of
their
command
and
were
mustered
out
in
sound
health
and
have
since
the
close
of
the
war
while
fighting
with
the
same
indomitable
and
independent
spirit
the
contests
of
civil
life
been
overcome
by
disease
or
casualty
i
am
not
unaware
that
the
pension
roll
already
involves
a
very
large
annual
expenditure
neither
am
i
deterred
by
that
fact
from
recommending
that
congress
grant
a
pension
to
such
honorably
discharged
soldiers
and
sailors
of
the
civil
war
as
having
rendered
substantial
service
during
the
war
are
now
dependent
upon
their
own
labor
for
a
maintenance
and
by
disease
or
casualty
are
incapacitated
from
earning
it
many
of
the
men
who
would
be
included
in
this
form
of
relief
are
now
dependent
upon
public
aid
and
it
does
not
in
my
judgment
consist
with
the
national
honor
that
they
shall
continue
to
subsist
upon
the
local
relief
given
indiscriminately
to
paupers
instead
of
upon
the
special
and
generous
provision
of
the
nation
they
served
so
gallantly
and
unselfishly
our
people
will
i
am
sure
very
generally
approve
such
legislation
and
i
am
equally
sure
that
the
survivors
of
the
union
army
and
navy
will
feel
a
grateful
sense
of
relief
when
this
worthy
and
suffering
class
of
their
comrades
is
fairly
cared
for
there
are
some
manifest
inequalities
in
the
existing
law
that
should
be
remedied
to
some
of
these
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
called
attention
it
is
gratifying
to
be
able
to
state
that
by
the
adoption
of
new
and
better
methods
in
the
war
department
the
calls
of
the
pension
office
for
information
as
to
the
military
and
hospital
records
of
pension
claimants
are
now
promptly
answered
and
the
injurious
and
vexatious
delays
that
have
heretofore
occurred
are
entirely
avoided
this
will
greatly
facilitate
the
adjustment
of
all
pending
claims
the
advent
of

new
statessouth

in
the

month
and
the
admission
of
their
duly
chosen
representatives
to
our
national
congress
at
the
same
session
is
an
event
as
unexampled
as
it
is
interesting
the
certification
of
the
votes
cast
and
of
the
constitutions
adopted
in
each
of
the
states
was
filed
with
me
as
required
by
the
eighth
section
of
the
act
of
february
by
the
governors
of
said
territories
respectively
having
after
a
careful
examination
found
that
the
several
constitutions
and
governments
were
republican
in
form
and
not
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
all
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
had
been
complied
with
and
that
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
in
each
of
said
proposed
states
was
in
favor
of
the
adoption
of
the

submitted
therein

as
to
washington
on
monday
november
each
of
these
states
has
within
it
resources
the
development
of
which
will
employ
the
energies
of
and
yield
a
comfortable
subsistence
to
a
great
population
the
smallest
of
these
new
states
washington
stands
twelfth
and
the
largest
montana
third
among
the
fortytwo
in
area
the
people
of
these
states
are
already
welltrained
intelligent
and
patriotic
american
citizens
having
common
interests
and
sympathies
with
those
of
the
older
states
and
a
common
purpose
to
defend
the
integrity
and
uphold
the
honor
of
the
nation
the
attention
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
been
called
to
the
urgent
need
of
congressional
legislation
for
the
better
protection
of
the
lives
and
limbs
of
those
engaged
in
operating
the
great
interstate
freight
lines
of
the
country
and
especially
of
the
yardmen
and
brakemen
a
petition
signed
by
nearly
railway
brakemen
was
presented
to
the
commission
asking
that
steps
might
be
taken
to
bring
about
the
use
of
automatic
brakes
and
couplers
on
freight
cars
at
a
meeting
of
state
railroad
commissioners
and
their
accredited
representatives
held
at
washington
in
march
last
upon
the
invitation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
a
resolution
was
unanimously
adopted
urging
the
commission
to
consider
what
can
be
done
to
prevent
the
loss
of
life
and
limb
in
coupling
and
uncoupling
freight
cars
and
in
handling
the
brakes
of
such
cars
during
the
year
ending
june
over
railroad
employees
were
killed
in
service
and
more
than
injured
it
is
competent
i
think
for
congress
to
require
uniformity
in
the
construction
of
cars
used
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
use
of
improved
safety
appliances
upon
such
trains
time
will
be
necessary
to
make
the
needed
changes
but
an
earnest
and
intelligent
beginning
should
be
made
at
once
it
is
a
reproach
to
our
civilization
that
any
class
of
american
workmen
should
in
the
pursuit
of
a
necessary
and
useful
vocation
be
subjected
to
a
peril
of
life
and
limb
as
great
as
that
of
a
soldier
in
time
of
war
the
creation
of
an
executive
department
to
be
known
as
the
department
of
agriculture
by
the
act
of
february
last
was
a
wise
and
timely
response
to
a
request
which
had
long
been
respectfully
urged
by
the
farmers
of
the
country
but
much
remains
to
be
done
to
perfect
the
organization
of
the
department
so
that
it
may
fairly
realize
the
expectations
which
its
creation
excited
in
this
connection
attention
is
called
to
the
suggestions
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
which
is
herewith
submitted
the
need
of
a
law
officer
for
the
department
such
as
is
provided
for
the
other
executive
departments
is
manifest
the
failure
of
the
last
congress
to
make
the
usual
provision
for
the
publication
of
the
annual
report
should
be
promptly
remedied
the
public
interest
in
the
report
and
its
value
to
the
farming
community
i
am
sure
will
not
be
diminished
under
the
new
organization
of
the
department
i
recommend
that
the
weather
service
be
separated
from
the
war
department
and
established
as
a
bureau
in
the
department
of
agriculture
this
will
involve
an
entire
reorganization
both
of
the
weather
bureau
and
of
the
signal
corps
making
of
the
first
a
purely
civil
organization
and
of
the
other
a
purely
military
staff
corps
the
report
of
the
chief
signal
officer
shows
that
the
work
of
the
corps
on
its
military
side
has
been
deteriorating
the
interests
of
the
people
of
the
district
of
columbia
should
not
be
lost
sight
of
in
the
pressure
for
consideration
of
measures
affecting
the
whole
country
having
no
legislature
of
its
own
either
municipal
or
general
its
people
must
look
to
congress
for
the
regulation
of
all
those
concerns
that
in
the
states
are
the
subject
of
local
control
our
whole
people
have
an
interest
that
the
national
capital
should
be
made
attractive
and
beautiful
and
above
all
that
its
repute
for
social
order
should
be
well
maintained
the
laws
regulating
the
sale
of
intoxicating
drinks
in
the
district
should
be
revised
with
a
view
to
bringing
the
traffic
under
stringent
limitations
and
control
in
execution
of
the
power
conferred
upon
me
by
the
act
making
appropriations
for
the
expenses
of
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
year
ending
june
i
did
on
the
th
day
of
august
last
appoint
rudolph
hering
of
new
york
samuel
m
gray
of
rhode
island
and
frederick
p
stearns
of
massachusetts
three
eminent
sanitary
engineers
to
examine
and
report
upon
the
system
of
sewerage
existing
in
the
district
of
columbia
their
report
which
is
not
yet
completed
will
be
in
due
course
submitted
to
congress
the
report
of
the
commissioners
of
the
district
is
herewith
transmitted
and
the
attention
of
congress
is
called
to
the
suggestions
contained
therein
the
proposition
to
observe
the
four
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
discovery
of
america
by
the
opening
of
a
worlds
fair
or
exposition
in
some
one
of
our
great
cities
will
be
presented
for
the
consideration
of
congress
the
value
and
interest
of
such
an
exposition
may
well
claim
the
promotion
of
the
general
government
on
t
he
th
of
march
last
the
civil
service
commission
had
but
a
single
member
the
vacancies
were
filled
on
the
th
day
of
may
and
since
then
the
commissioners
have
been
industriously
though
with
an
inadequate
force
engaged
in
executing
the
law
they
were
assured
by
me
that
a
cordial
support
would
be
given
them
in
the
faithful
and
impartial
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
of
the
rules
and
regulations
adopted
in
aid
of
it
heretofore
the
book
of
eligibles
has
been
closed
to
everyone
except
as
certifications
were
made
upon
the
requisition
of
the
appointing
officers
this
secrecy
was
the
source
of
much
suspicion
and
of
many
charges
of
favoritism
in
the
administration
of
the
law
what
is
secret
is
always
suspected
what
is
open
can
be
judged
the
commission
with
the
full
approval
of
all
its
members
has
now
opened
the
list
of
eligibles
to
the
public
the
eligible
lists
for
the
classified
postoffices
and
customhouses
are
now
publicly
posted
in
the
respective
offices
as
are
also
the
certifications
for
appointments
the
purpose
of
the
civilservice
law
was
absolutely
to
exclude
any
other
consideration
in
connection
with
appointments
under
it
than
that
of
merit
as
tested
by
the
examinations
the
business
proceeds
upon
the
theory
that
both
the
examining
boards
and
the
appointing
officers
are
absolutely
ignorant
as
to
the
political
views
and
associations
of
all
persons
on
the
civilservice
lists
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
however
that
some
recent
congressional
investigations
have
somewhat
shaken
public
confidence
in
the
impartiality
of
the
selections
for
appointment
the
reform
of
the
civil
service
will
make
no
safe
or
satisfactory
advance
until
the
present
law
and
its
equal
administration
are
well
established
in
the
confidence
of
the
people
it
will
be
my
pleasure
as
it
is
my
duty
to
see
that
the
law
is
executed
with
firmness
and
impartiality
if
some
of
its
provisions
have
been
fraudulently
evaded
by
appointing
officers
our
resentment
should
not
suggest
the
repeal
of
the
law
but
reform
in
its
administration
we
should
have
one
view
of
the
matter
and
hold
it
with
a
sincerity
that
is
not
affected
by
the
consideration
that
the
party
to
which
we
belong
is
for
the
time
in
power
my
predecessor
on
the
th
day
of
january
by
an
executive
order
to
take
effect
march
brought
the
railway
mail
service
under
the
operation
of
the
civilservice
law
provision
was
made
that
the
order
should
take
effect
sooner
in
any
state
where
an
eligible
list
was
sooner
obtained
on
the
th
day
of
march
mr
lyman
then
the
only
member
of
the
commission
reported
to
me
in
writing
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
have
the
list
of
eligibles
ready
before
may
and
requested
that
the
taking
effect
of
the
order
be
postponed
until
that
time
which
was
done
subject
to
the
same
provision
contained
in
the
original
order
as
to
states
in
which
an
eligible
list
was
sooner
obtained
as
a
result
of
the
revision
of
the
rules
of
the
new
classification
and
of
the
inclusion
of
the
railway
mail
service
the
work
of
the
commission
has
been
greatly
increased
and
the
present
clerical
force
is
found
to
be
inadequate
i
recommend
that
the
additional
clerks
asked
by
the
commission
be
appropriated
for
the
duty
of
appointment
is
devolved
by
the
constitution
or
by
the
law
and
the
appointing
officers
are
properly
held
to
a
high
responsibility
in
its
exercise
the
growth
of
the
country
and
the
consequent
increase
of
the
civil
list
have
magnified
this
function
of
the
executive
disproportionally
it
can
not
be
denied
however
that
the
labor
connected
with
this
necessary
work
is
increased
often
to
the
point
of
actual
distress
by
the
sudden
and
excessive
demands
that
are
made
upon
an
incoming
administration
for
removals
and
appointments
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
true
that
incumbency
is
a
conclusive
argument
for
continuance
in
office
impartiality
moderation
fidelity
to
public
duty
and
a
good
attainment
in
the
discharge
of
it
must
be
added
before
the
argument
is
complete
when
those
holding
administrative
offices
so
conduct
themselves
as
to
convince
just
political
opponents
that
no
party
consideration
or
bias
affects
in
any
way
the
discharge
of
their
public
duties
we
can
more
easily
stay
the
demand
for
removals
i
am
satisfied
that
both
in
and
out
of
the
classified
service
great
benefit
would
accrue
from
the
adoption
of
some
system
by
which
the
officer
would
receive
the
distinction
and
benefit
that
in
all
private
employments
comes
from
exceptional
faithfulness
and
efficiency
in
the
performance
of
duty
i
have
suggested
to
the
heads
of
the
executive
departments
that
they
consider
whether
a
record
might
not
be
kept
in
each
bureau
of
all
those
elements
that
are
covered
by
the
terms
faithfulness
and
efficiency
and
a
rating
made
showing
the
relative
merits
of
the
clerks
of
each
class
this
rating
to
be
regarded
as
a
test
of
merit
in
making
promotions
i
have
also
suggested
to
the
postmastergeneral
that
he
adopt
some
plan
by
which
he
can
upon
the
basis
of
the
reports
to
the
department
and
of
frequent
inspections
indicate
the
relative
merit
of
postmasters
of
each
class
they
will
be
appropriately
indicated
in
the
official
register
and
in
the
report
of
the
department
that
a
great
stimulus
would
thus
be
given
to
the
whole
service
i
do
not
doubt
and
such
a
record
would
be
the
best
defense
against
inconsiderate
removals
from
office
the
interest
of
the
general
government
in
the
education
of
the
people
found
an
early
expression
not
only
in
the
thoughtful
and
sometimes
warning
utterances
of
our
ablest
statesmen
but
in
liberal
appropriations
from
the
common
resources
for
the
support
of
education
in
the
new
states
no
one
will
deny
that
it
is
of
the
gravest
national
concern
that
those
who
hold
the
ultimate
control
of
all
public
affairs
should
have
the
necessary
intelligence
wisely
to
direct
and
determine
them
national
aid
to
education
has
heretofore
taken
the
form
of
land
grants
and
in
that
form
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
promote
the
education
of
the
people
is
not
seriously
questioned
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
successfully
questioned
when
the
form
is
changed
to
that
of
a
direct
grant
of
money
from
the
public
treasury
such
aid
should
be
as
it
always
has
been
suggested
by
some
exceptional
conditions
the
sudden
emancipation
of
the
slaves
of
the
south
the
bestowal
of
the
suffrage
which
soon
followed
and
the
impairment
of
the
ability
of
the
states
where
these
new
citizens
were
chiefly
found
to
adequately
provide
educational
facilities
presented
not
only
exceptional
but
unexampled
conditions
that
the
situation
has
been
much
ameliorated
there
is
no
doubt
the
ability
and
interest
of
the
states
have
happily
increased
but
a
great
work
remains
to
be
done
and
i
think
the
general
government
should
lend
its
aid
as
the
suggestion
of
a
national
grant
in
aid
of
education
grows
chiefly
out
of
the
condition
and
needs
of
the
emancipated
slave
and
his
descendants
the
relief
should
as
far
as
possible
while
necessarily
proceeding
upon
some
general
lines
be
applied
to
the
need
that
suggested
it
it
is
essential
if
much
good
is
to
be
accomplished
that
the
sympathy
and
active
interest
of
the
people
of
the
states
should
be
enlisted
and
that
the
methods
adopted
should
be
such
as
to
stimulate
and
not
to
supplant
local
taxation
for
school
purposes
as
one
congress
can
not
bind
a
succeeding
one
in
such
a
case
and
as
the
effort
must
in
some
degree
be
experimental
i
recommend
that
any
appropriation
made
for
this
purpose
be
so
limited
in
annual
amount
and
as
to
the
time
over
which
it
is
to
extend
as
will
on
the
one
hand
give
the
local
school
authorities
opportunity
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
first
years
allowance
and
on
the
other
deliver
them
from
the
temptation
to
unduly
postpone
the
assumption
of
the
whole
burden
themselves
the
colored
people
did
not
intrude
themselves
upon
us
they
were
brought
here
in
chains
and
held
in
the
communities
where
they
are
now
chiefly
found
by
a
cruel
slave
code
happily
for
both
races
they
are
now
free
they
have
from
a
standpoint
of
ignorance
and
povertywhich
was
our
shame
not
theirsmade
remarkable
advances
in
education
and
in
the
acquisition
of
property
they
have
as
a
people
shown
themselves
to
be
friendly
and
faithful
toward
the
white
race
under
temptations
of
tremendous
strength
they
have
their
representatives
in
the
national
cemeteries
where
a
grateful
government
has
gathered
the
ashes
of
those
who
died
in
its
defense
they
have
furnished
to
our
regular
army
regiments
that
have
won
high
praise
from
their
commanding
officers
for
courage
and
soldierly
qualities
and
for
fidelity
to
the
enlistment
oath
in
civil
life
they
are
now
the
toilers
of
their
communities
making
their
full
contribution
to
the
widening
streams
of
prosperity
which
these
communities
are
receiving
their
sudden
withdrawal
would
stop
production
and
bring
disorder
into
the
household
as
well
as
the
shop
generally
they
do
not
desire
to
quit
their
homes
and
their
employers
resent
the
interference
of
the
emigration
agents
who
seek
to
stimulate
such
a
desire
but
notwithstanding
all
this
in
many
parts
of
our
country
where
the
colored
population
is
large
the
people
of
that
race
are
by
various
devices
deprived
of
any
effective
exercise
of
their
political
rights
and
of
many
of
their
civil
rights
the
wrong
does
not
expend
itself
upon
those
whose
votes
are
suppressed
every
constituency
in
the
union
is
wronged
it
has
been
the
hope
of
every
patriot
that
a
sense
of
justice
and
of
respect
for
the
law
would
work
a
gradual
cure
of
these
flagrant
evils
surely
no
one
supposes
that
the
present
can
be
accepted
as
a
permanent
condition
if
it
is
said
that
these
communities
must
work
out
this
problem
for
themselves
we
have
a
right
to
ask
whether
they
are
at
work
upon
it
do
they
suggest
any
solution
when
and
under
what
conditions
is
the
black
man
to
have
a
free
ballot
when
is
he
in
fact
to
have
those
full
civil
rights
which
have
so
long
been
his
in
law
when
is
that
equality
of
influence
which
our
form
of
government
was
intended
to
secure
to
the
electors
to
be
restored
this
generation
should
cou
rageously
face
these
grave
questions
and
not
leave
them
as
a
heritage
of
woe
to
the
next
the
consultation
should
proceed
with
candor
calmness
and
great
patience
upon
the
lines
of
justice
and
humanity
not
of
prejudice
and
cruelty
no
question
in
our
country
can
be
at
rest
except
upon
the
firm
base
of
justice
and
of
the
law
i
earnestly
invoke
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
consideration
of
such
measures
within
its
welldefined
constitutional
powers
as
will
secure
to
all
our
people
a
free
exercise
of
the
right
of
suffrage
and
every
other
civil
right
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
no
evil
however
deplorable
can
justify
the
assumption
either
on
the
part
of
the
executive
or
of
congress
of
powers
not
granted
but
both
will
be
highly
blamable
if
all
the
powers
granted
are
not
wisely
but
firmly
used
to
correct
these
evils
the
power
to
take
the
whole
direction
and
control
of
the
election
of
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
is
clearly
given
to
the
general
government
a
partial
and
qualified
supervision
of
these
elections
is
now
provided
for
by
law
and
in
my
opinion
this
law
may
be
so
strengthened
and
extended
as
to
secure
on
the
whole
better
results
than
can
be
attained
by
a
law
taking
all
the
processes
of
such
election
into
federal
control
the
colored
man
should
be
protected
in
all
of
his
relations
to
the
federal
government
whether
as
litigant
juror
or
witness
in
our
courts
as
an
elector
for
members
of
congress
or
as
a
peaceful
traveler
upon
our
interstate
railways
there
is
nothing
more
justly
humiliating
to
the
national
pride
and
nothing
more
hurtful
to
the
national
prosperity
than
the
inferiority
of
our
merchant
marine
compared
with
that
of
other
nations
whose
general
resources
wealth
and
seacoast
lines
do
not
suggest
any
reason
for
their
supremacy
on
the
sea
it
was
not
always
so
and
our
people
are
agreed
i
think
that
it
shall
not
continue
to
be
so
it
is
not
possible
in
this
communication
to
discuss
the
causes
of
the
decay
of
our
shipping
interests
or
the
differing
methods
by
which
it
is
proposed
to
restore
them
the
statement
of
a
few
wellauthenticated
facts
and
some
general
suggestions
as
to
legislation
is
all
that
is
practicable
that
the
great
steamship
lines
sailing
under
the
flags
of
england
france
germany
spain
and
italy
and
engaged
in
foreign
commerce
were
promoted
and
have
since
been
and
now
are
liberally
aided
by
grants
of
public
money
in
one
form
or
another
is
generally
known
that
the
american
lines
of
steamships
have
been
abandoned
by
us
to
an
unequal
contest
with
the
aided
lines
of
other
nations
until
they
have
been
withdrawn
or
in
the
few
cases
where
they
are
still
maintained
are
subject
to
serious
disadvantages
is
matter
of
common
knowledge
the
present
situation
is
such
that
travelers
and
merchandise
find
liverpool
often
a
necessary
intermediate
port
between
new
york
and
some
of
the
south
american
capitals
the
fact
that
some
of
the
delegates
from
south
american
states
to
the
conference
of
american
nations
now
in
session
at
washington
reached
our
shores
by
reversing
that
line
of
travel
is
very
conclusive
of
the
need
of
such
a
conference
and
very
suggestive
as
to
the
first
and
most
necessary
step
in
the
direction
of
fuller
and
more
beneficial
intercourse
with
nations
that
are
now
our
neighbors
upon
the
lines
of
latitude
but
not
upon
the
lines
of
established
commercial
intercourse
i
recommend
that
such
appropriations
be
made
for
ocean
mail
service
in
american
steamships
between
our
ports
and
those
of
central
and
south
america
china
japan
and
the
important
islands
in
both
of
the
great
oceans
as
will
be
liberally
remunerative
for
the
service
rendered
and
as
will
encourage
the
establishment
and
in
some
fair
degree
equalize
the
chances
of
american
steamship
lines
in
the
competitions
which
they
must
meet
that
the
american
states
lying
south
of
us
will
cordially
cooperate
in
establishing
and
maintaining
such
lines
of
steamships
to
their
principal
ports
i
do
not
doubt
we
should
also
make
provision
for
a
naval
reserve
to
consist
of
such
merchant
ships
of
american
construction
and
of
a
specified
tonnage
and
speed
as
the
owners
will
consent
to
place
at
the
use
of
the
government
in
case
of
need
as
armed
cruisers
england
has
adopted
this
policy
and
as
a
result
can
now
upon
necessity
at
once
place
upon
her
naval
list
some
of
the
fastest
steamships
in
the
world
a
proper
supervision
of
the
construction
of
such
vessels
would
make
their
conversion
into
effective
ships
of
war
very
easy
i
am
an
advocate
of
economy
in
our
national
expenditures
but
it
is
a
misuse
of
terms
to
make
this
word
describe
a
policy
that
withholds
an
expenditure
for
the
purpose
of
extending
our
foreign
commerce
the
enlargement
and
improvement
of
our
merchant
marine
the
development
of
a
sufficient
body
of
trained
american
seamen
the
promotion
of
rapid
and
regular
mail
communication
between
the
ports
of
other
countries
and
our
own
and
the
adaptation
of
large
and
swift
american
merchant
steamships
to
naval
uses
in
time
of
war
are
public
purposes
of
the
highest
concern
the
enlarged
participation
of
our
people
in
the
carrying
trade
the
new
and
increased
markets
that
will
be
opened
for
the
products
of
our
farms
and
factories
and
the
fuller
and
better
employment
of
our
mechanics
which
will
result
from
a
liberal
promotion
of
our
foreign
commerce
insure
the
widest
possible
diffusion
of
benefit
to
all
the
states
and
to
all
our
people
everything
is
most
propitious
for
the
present
inauguration
of
a
liberal
and
progressive
policy
upon
this
subject
and
we
should
enter
upon
it
with
promptness
and
decision
the
legislation
which
i
have
suggested
it
is
sincerely
believed
will
promote
the
peace
and
honor
of
our
country
and
the
prosperity
and
security
of
the
people
i
invoke
the
diligent
and
serious
attention
of
congress
to
the
consideration
of
these
and
such
other
measures
as
may
be
presented
having
the
same
great
end
in
view
benj
harrison

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
since
the
close
of
your
last
session
the
american
people
in
the
exercise
of
their
highest
right
of
suffrage
have
chosen
their
chief
magistrate
for
the
four
years
ensuing
when
it
is
remembered
that
at
no
period
in
the
countrys
history
has
the
long
political
contest
which
customarily
precedes
the
day
of
the
national
election
been
waged
with
greater
fervor
and
intensity
it
is
a
subject
of
general
congratulation
that
after
the
controversy
at
the
polls
was
over
and
while
the
slight
preponderance
by
which
the
issue
had
been
determined
was
as
yet
unascertained
the
public
peace
suffered
no
disturbance
but
the
people
everywhere
patiently
and
quietly
awaited
the
result
nothing
could
more
strikingly
illustrate
the
temper
of
the
american
citizen
his
love
of
order
and
his
loyalty
to
law
nothing
could
more
signally
demonstrate
the
strength
and
wisdom
of
our
political
institutions
eight
years
have
passed
since
a
controversy
concerning
the
result
of
a
national
election
sharply
called
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
the
necessity
of
providing
more
precise
and
definite
regulations
for
counting
the
electoral
vote
it
is
of
the
gravest
importance
that
this
question
be
solved
before
conflicting
claims
to
the
presidency
shall
again
distract
the
country
and
i
am
persuaded
that
by
the
people
at
large
any
of
the
measures
of
relief
thus
far
proposed
would
be
preferred
to
continued
inaction
our
relations
with
all
foreign
powers
continue
to
be
amicable
with
belgium
a
convention
has
been
signed
whereby
the
scope
of
present
treaties
has
been
so
enlarged
as
to
secure
to
citizens
of
either
country
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
other
equal
rights
and
privileges
in
the
acquisition
and
alienation
of
property
a
trademarks
treaty
has
also
been
concluded
the
war
between
chile
and
peru
is
at
an
end
for
the
arbitration
of
the
claims
of
american
citizens
who
during
its
continuance
suffered
through
the
acts
of
the
chilean
authorities
a
convention
will
soon
be
negotiated
the
state
of
hostilities
between
france
and
china
continues
to
be
an
embarrassing
feature
of
our
eastern
relations
the
chinese
government
has
promptly
adjusted
and
paid
the
claims
of
american
citizens
whose
property
was
destroyed
in
the
recent
riots
at
canton
i
renew
the
recommendation
of
my
last
annual
message
that
the
canton
indemnity
fund
be
returned
to
china
the
true
interpretation
of
the
recent
treaty
with
that
country
permitting
the
restriction
of
chinese
immigration
is
likely
to
be
again
the
subject
of
your
deliberations
it
may
be
seriously
questioned
whether
the
statute
passed
at
the
last
session
does
not
violate
the
treaty
rights
of
certain
chinese
who
left
this
country
with
return
certificates
valid
under
the
old
law
and
who
now
seem
to
be
debarred
from
relanding
for
lack
of
the
certificates
required
by
the
new
the
recent
purchase
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
a
large
trading
fleet
heretofore
under
the
chinese
flag
has
considerably
enhanced
our
commercial
importance
in
the
east
in
view
of
the
large
number
of
vessels
built
or
purchased
by
american
citizens
in
other
countries
and
exclusively
employed
in
legitimate
traffic
between
foreign
ports
under
the
recognized
protection
of
our
flag
it
might
be
well
to
provide
a
uniform
rule
for
their
registration
and
documentation
so
that
the
bona
fide
property
rights
of
our
citizens
therein
shall
be
duly
evidenced
and
properly
guarded
pursuant
to
the
advice
of
the
senate
at
the
last
session
i
recognized
the
flag
of
the
international
association
of
the
kongo
as
that
of
a
friendly
government
avoiding
in
so
doing
any
prejudgment
of
conflicting
territorial
claims
in
that
region
subsequently
in
execution
of
the
expressed
wish
of
the
congress
i
appointed
a
commercial
agent
for
the
kongo
basin
the
importance
of
the
rich
prospective
trade
of
the
kongo
valley
has
led
to
the
general
conviction
that
it
should
be
open
to
all
nations
upon
equal
terms
at
an
international
conference
for
the
consideration
of
this
subject
called
by
the
emperor
of
germany
and
now
in
session
at
berlin
delegates
are
in
attendance
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
of
the
results
of
the
conference
you
will
be
duly
advised
the
government
of
korea
has
generously
aided
the
efforts
of
the
united
states
minister
to
secure
suitable
premises
for
the
use
of
the
legation
as
the
conditions
of
diplomatic
intercourse
with
eastern
nations
demand
that
the
legation
premises
be
owned
by
the
represented
power
i
advise
that
an
appropriation
be
made
for
the
acquisition
of
this
property
by
the
government
the
united
states
already
possess
valuable
premises
at
tangier
as
a
gift
from
the
sultan
of
morocco
as
is
stated
hereafter
they
have
lately
received
a
similar
gift
from
the
siamese
government
the
government
of
japan
stands
ready
to
present
to
us
extensive
grounds
at
tokyo
whereon
to
erect
a
suitable
building
for
the
legation
courthouse
and
jail
and
similar
privileges
can
probably
be
secured
in
china
and
persia
the
owning
of
such
premises
would
not
only
effect
a
large
saving
of
the
present
rentals
but
would
permit
of
the
due
assertion
of
extraterritorial
rights
in
those
countries
and
would
the
better
serve
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
the
united
states
the
failure
of
congress
to
make
appropriation
for
our
representation
at
the
autonomous
court
of
the
khedive
has
proved
a
serious
embarrassment
in
our
intercourse
with
egypt
and
in
view
of
the
necessary
intimacy
of
diplomatic
relationship
due
to
the
participation
of
this
government
as
one
of
the
treaty
powers
in
all
matters
of
administration
there
affecting
the
rights
of
foreigners
i
advise
the
restoration
of
the
agency
and
consulategeneral
at
cairo
on
its
former
basis
i
do
not
conceive
it
to
be
the
wish
of
congress
that
the
united
states
should
withdraw
altogether
from
the
honorable
position
they
have
hitherto
held
with
respect
to
the
khedive
or
that
citizens
of
this
republic
residing
or
sojourning
in
egypt
should
hereafter
be
without
the
aid
and
protection
of
a
competent
representative
with
france
the
traditional
cordial
relationship
continues
the
colossal
statue
of
liberty
enlightening
the
world
the
generous
gift
of
the
people
of
france
is
expected
to
reach
new
york
in
may
next
i
suggest
that
congressional
action
be
taken
in
recognition
of
the
spirit
which
has
prompted
this
gift
and
in
aid
of
the
timely
completion
of
the
pedestal
upon
which
it
is
to
be
placed
our
relations
with
germany
a
country
which
contributes
to
our
own
some
of
the
best
elements
of
citizenship
continue
to
be
cordial
the
united
states
have
extradition
treaties
with
several
of
the
german
states
but
by
reason
of
the
confederation
of
those
states
under
the
imperial
rule
the
application
of
such
treaties
is
not
as
uniform
and
comprehensive
as
the
interests
of
the
two
countries
require
i
propose
therefore
to
open
negotiations
for
a
single
convention
of
extradition
to
embrace
all
the
territory
of
the
empire
it
affords
me
pleasure
to
say
that
our
intercourse
with
great
britain
continues
to
be
of
a
most
friendly
character
the
government
of
hawaii
has
indicated
its
willingness
to
continue
for
seven
years
the
provisions
of
the
existing
reciprocity
treaty
such
continuance
in
view
of
the
relations
of
that
country
to
the
american
system
of
states
should
in
my
judgment
be
favored
the
revolution
in
hayti
against
the
established
government
has
terminated
while
it
was
in
progress
it
became
necessary
to
enforce
our
neutrality
laws
by
instituting
proceedings
against
individuals
and
vessels
charged
with
their
infringement
these
prosecutions
were
in
all
cases
successful
much
anxiety
has
lately
been
displayed
by
various
european
governments
and
especially
by
the
government
of
italy
for
the
abolition
of
our
import
duties
upon
works
of
art
it
is
well
to
consider
whether
the
present
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
productions
of
american
artists
abroad
is
not
likely
to
result
as
they
themselves
seem
very
generally
to
believe
it
may
in
the
practical
exclusion
of
our
painters
and
sculptors
from
the
rich
fields
for
observation
study
and
labor
which
they
have
hitherto
enjoyed
there
is
prospect
that
the
longpending
revision
of
the
foreign
treaties
of
japan
may
be
concluded
at
a
new
conference
to
be
held
at
tokyo
while
this
government
fully
recognizes
the
equal
and
independent
station
of
japan
in
the
community
of
nations
it
would
not
oppose
the
general
adoption
of
such
terms
of
compromise
as
japan
may
be
disposed
to
offer
in
furtherance
of
a
uniform
policy
of
intercourse
with
western
nations
during
the
past
year
the
increasing
good
will
between
our
own
government
and
that
of
mexico
has
been
variously
manifested
the
treaty
of
commercial
reciprocity
concluded
january
has
been
ratified
and
awaits
the
necessary
tariff
legislation
of
congress
to
become
effective
this
legislation
will
i
doubt
not
be
among
the
first
measures
to
claim
your
attention
a
full
treaty
of
commerce
navigation
and
consular
rights
is
much
to
be
desired
and
such
a
treaty
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
mexican
government
stands
ready
to
conclude
some
embarrassment
has
been
occasioned
by
the
failure
of
congress
at
its
last
session
to
provide
means
for
the
due
execution
of
the
treaty
of
july
for
the
resurvey
of
the
mexican
boundary
and
the
relocation
of
boundary
monuments
with
the
republic
of
nicaragua
a
treaty
has
been
concluded
which
authorizes
the
construction
by
the
united
states
of
a
canal
railway
and
telegraph
line
across
the
nicaraguan
territory
by
the
terms
of
this
treaty
miles
of
the
river
san
juan
as
well
as
lake
nicaragua
an
inland
sea
miles
in
width
are
to
constitute
a
part
of
the
projected
enterprise
this
leaves
for
actual
canal
construction
miles
on
the
pacific
side
and
miles
on
the
atlantic
to
the
united
states
whose
rich
territory
on
the
pacific
is
for
the
ordinary
purposes
of
commerce
practically
cut
off
from
communication
by
water
with
the
atlantic
ports
the
political
and
commercial
advantages
of
such
a
project
can
scarcely
be
overestimated
it
is
believed
that
when
the
treaty
is
laid
be
fore
you
the
justice
and
liberality
of
its
provisions
will
command
universal
approval
at
home
and
abroad
the
death
of
our
representative
at
russia
while
at
his
post
at
st
petersburg
afforded
to
the
imperial
government
a
renewed
opportunity
to
testify
its
sympathy
in
a
manner
befitting
the
intimate
friendliness
which
has
ever
marked
the
intercourse
of
the
two
countries
the
course
of
this
government
in
raising
its
representation
at
bangkok
to
the
diplomatic
rank
has
evoked
from
siam
evidences
of
warm
friendship
and
augurs
well
for
our
enlarged
intercourse
the
siamese
government
has
presented
to
the
united
states
a
commodious
mansion
and
grounds
for
the
occupancy
of
the
legation
and
i
suggest
that
by
joint
resolution
congress
attest
its
appreciation
of
this
generous
gift
this
government
has
more
than
once
been
called
upon
of
late
to
take
action
in
fulfillment
of
its
international
obligations
toward
spain
agitation
in
the
island
of
cuba
hostile
to
the
spanish
crown
having
been
fomented
by
persons
abusing
the
sacred
rights
of
hospitality
which
our
territory
affords
the
officers
of
this
government
have
been
instructed
to
exercise
vigilance
to
prevent
infractions
of
our
neutrality
laws
at
key
west
and
at
other
points
near
the
cuban
coast
i
am
happy
to
say
that
in
the
only
instance
where
these
precautionary
measures
were
successfully
eluded
the
offenders
when
found
in
our
territory
were
subsequently
tried
and
convicted
the
growing
need
of
close
relationship
of
intercourse
and
traffic
between
the
spanish
antilles
and
their
natural
market
in
the
united
states
led
to
the
adoption
in
january
last
of
a
commercial
agreement
looking
to
that
end
this
agreement
has
since
been
superseded
by
a
more
carefully
framed
and
comprehensive
convention
which
i
shall
submit
to
the
senate
for
approval
it
has
been
the
aim
of
this
negotiation
to
open
such
a
favored
reciprocal
exchange
of
productions
carried
under
the
flag
of
either
country
as
to
make
the
intercourse
between
cuba
and
puerto
rico
and
ourselves
scarcely
less
intimate
than
the
commercial
movement
between
our
domestic
ports
and
to
insure
a
removal
of
the
burdens
on
shipping
in
the
spanish
indies
of
which
in
the
past
our
shipowners
and
shipmasters
have
so
often
had
cause
to
complain
the
negotiation
of
this
convention
has
for
a
time
postponed
the
prosecution
of
certain
claims
of
our
citizens
which
were
declared
to
be
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
late
spanishamerican
claims
commission
and
which
are
therefore
remitted
to
diplomatic
channels
for
adjustment
the
speedy
settlement
of
these
claims
will
now
be
urged
by
this
government
negotiations
for
a
treaty
of
commercial
reciprocity
with
the
dominican
republic
have
been
successfully
concluded
and
the
result
will
shortly
be
laid
before
the
senate
certain
questions
between
the
united
states
and
the
ottoman
empire
still
remain
unsolved
complaints
on
behalf
of
our
citizens
are
not
satisfactorily
adjusted
the
porte
has
sought
to
withhold
from
our
commerce
the
right
of
favored
treatment
to
which
we
are
entitled
by
existing
conventional
stipulations
and
the
revision
of
the
tariffs
is
unaccomplished
the
final
disposition
of
pending
questions
with
venezuela
has
not
as
yet
been
reached
but
i
have
good
reason
to
expect
an
early
settlement
which
will
provide
the
means
of
reexamining
the
caracas
awards
in
conformity
with
the
expressed
desire
of
congress
and
which
will
recognize
the
justice
of
certain
claims
preferred
against
venezuela
the
central
and
south
american
commission
appointed
by
authority
of
the
act
of
july
will
soon
proceed
to
mexico
it
has
been
furnished
with
instructions
which
will
be
laid
before
you
they
contain
a
statement
of
the
general
policy
of
the
government
for
enlarging
its
commercial
intercourse
with
american
states
the
commissioners
have
been
actively
preparing
for
their
responsible
task
by
holding
conferences
in
the
principal
cities
with
merchants
and
others
interested
in
central
and
south
american
trade
the
international
meridian
conference
lately
convened
in
washington
upon
the
invitation
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
composed
of
representatives
from
twentyfive
nations
the
conference
concluded
its
labors
on
the
st
of
november
having
with
substantial
unanimity
agreed
upon
the
meridian
of
greenwich
as
the
starting
point
whence
longitude
is
to
be
computed
through
degrees
eastward
and
westward
and
upon
the
adoption
for
all
purposes
for
which
it
may
be
found
convenient
of
a
universal
day
which
shall
begin
at
midnight
on
the
initial
meridian
and
whose
hours
shall
be
counted
from
zero
up
to
twentyfour
the
formal
report
of
the
transactions
of
this
conference
will
be
hereafter
transmitted
to
the
congress
this
government
is
in
frequent
receipt
of
invitations
from
foreign
states
to
participate
in
international
exhibitions
often
of
great
interest
and
importance
occupying
as
we
do
an
advanced
position
in
the
worlds
production
and
aiming
to
secure
a
profitable
share
for
our
industries
in
the
general
competitive
markets
it
is
a
matter
of
serious
concern
that
the
want
of
means
for
participation
in
these
exhibitions
should
so
often
exclude
our
producers
from
advantages
enjoyed
by
those
of
other
countries
during
the
past
year
the
attention
of
congress
was
drawn
to
the
formal
invitations
in
this
regard
tendered
by
the
governments
of
england
holland
belgium
germany
and
austria
the
executive
has
in
some
instances
appointed
honorary
commissioners
this
is
however
a
most
unsatisfactory
expedient
for
without
some
provision
to
meet
the
necessary
working
expenses
of
a
commission
it
can
effect
little
or
nothing
in
behalf
of
exhibitors
an
international
inventions
exhibition
is
to
be
held
in
london
next
may
this
will
cover
a
field
of
special
importance
in
which
our
country
holds
a
foremost
rank
but
the
executive
is
at
present
powerless
to
organize
a
proper
representation
of
our
vast
national
interests
in
this
direction
i
have
in
several
previous
messages
referred
to
this
subject
it
seems
to
me
that
a
statute
giving
to
the
executive
general
discretionary
authority
to
accept
such
invitations
and
to
appoint
honorary
commissioners
without
salary
and
placing
at
the
disposal
of
the
secretary
of
state
a
small
fund
for
defraying
their
reasonable
expenses
would
be
of
great
public
utility
this
government
has
received
official
notice
that
the
revised
international
regulations
for
preventing
collisions
at
sea
have
been
adopted
by
all
the
leading
maritime
powers
except
the
united
states
and
came
into
force
on
the
st
of
september
last
for
the
due
protection
of
our
shipping
interests
the
provisions
of
our
statutes
should
at
once
be
brought
into
conformity
with
these
regulations
the
question
of
securing
to
authors
composers
and
artists
copyright
privileges
in
this
country
in
return
for
reciprocal
rights
abroad
is
one
that
may
justly
challenge
your
attention
it
is
true
that
conventions
will
be
necessary
for
fully
accomplishing
this
result
but
until
congress
shall
by
statute
fix
the
extent
to
which
foreign
holders
of
copyright
shall
be
here
privileged
it
has
been
deemed
inadvisable
to
negotiate
such
conventions
for
this
reason
the
united
states
were
not
represented
at
the
recent
conference
at
berne
i
recommend
that
the
scope
of
the
neutrality
laws
of
the
united
states
be
so
enlarged
as
to
cover
all
patent
acts
of
hostility
committed
in
our
territory
and
aimed
against
the
peace
of
a
friendly
nation
existing
statutes
prohibit
the
fitting
out
of
armed
expeditions
and
restrict
the
shipment
of
explosives
though
the
enactments
in
the
latter
respect
were
not
framed
with
regard
to
international
obligations
but
simply
for
the
protection
of
passenger
travel
all
these
statutes
were
intended
to
meet
special
emergencies
that
had
already
arisen
other
emergencies
have
arisen
since
and
modern
ingenuity
supplies
means
for
the
organization
of
hostilities
without
open
resort
to
armed
vessels
or
to
filibustering
parties
i
see
no
reason
why
overt
preparations
in
this
country
for
the
commission
of
criminal
acts
such
as
are
here
under
consideration
should
not
be
alike
punishable
whether
such
acts
are
intended
to
be
committed
in
our
own
country
or
in
a
foreign
country
with
which
we
are
at
peace
the
prompt
and
thorough
treatment
of
this
question
is
one
which
intimately
concerns
the
national
honor
our
existing
naturalization
laws
also
need
revision
those
sections
relating
to
persons
residing
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
in
and
have
now
only
a
historical
interest
section
recognizing
the
citizenship
of
the
children
of
naturalized
parents
is
ambiguous
in
its
terms
and
partly
obsolete
there
are
special
provisions
of
law
favoring
the
naturalization
of
those
who
serve
in
the
army
or
in
merchant
vessels
while
no
similar
privileges
are
granted
those
who
serve
in
the
navy
or
the
marine
corps
an
uniform
rule
of
naturalization
such
as
the
constitution
contemplates
should
among
other
things
clearly
define
the
status
of
persons
born
within
the
united
states
subject
to
a
foreign
power
section
and
of
minor
children
of
fathers
who
have
declared
their
intention
to
become
citizens
but
have
failed
to
perfect
their
naturalization
it
might
be
wise
to
provide
for
a
central
bureau
of
registry
wherein
should
be
filed
authenticated
transcripts
of
every
record
of
naturalization
in
the
several
federal
and
state
courts
and
to
make
provision
also
for
the
vacation
or
cancellation
of
such
record
in
cases
where
fraud
had
been
practiced
upon
the
court
by
the
applicant
himself
or
where
he
had
renounced
or
forfeited
his
acquired
citizenship
a
just
and
uniform
law
in
this
respect
would
strengthen
the
hands
of
the
government
in
protecting
its
citizens
abroad
and
would
pave
the
way
for
the
conclusion
of
treaties
of
naturalization
with
foreign
countries
the
legislation
of
the
last
session
effected
in
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
certain
changes
and
reductions
which
have
been
productive
of
embarrassment
the
population
and
commercial
activity
of
our
country
are
steadily
on
the
increase
and
are
giving
r
ise
to
new
varying
and
often
delicate
relationships
with
other
countries
our
foreign
establishment
now
embraces
nearly
double
the
area
of
operations
that
it
occupied
twenty
years
ago
the
confinement
of
such
a
service
within
the
limits
of
expenditure
then
established
is
not
it
seems
to
me
in
accordance
with
true
economy
a
community
of
people
should
be
adequately
represented
in
its
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
a
project
for
the
reorganization
of
the
consular
service
and
for
recasting
the
scheme
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
is
now
before
you
if
the
limits
of
a
short
session
will
not
allow
of
its
full
consideration
i
trust
that
you
will
not
fail
to
make
suitable
provision
for
the
present
needs
of
the
service
it
has
been
customary
to
define
in
the
appropriation
acts
the
rank
of
each
diplomatic
office
to
which
a
salary
is
attached
i
suggest
that
this
course
be
abandoned
and
that
it
be
left
to
the
president
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
to
fix
from
time
to
time
the
diplomatic
grade
of
the
representatives
of
this
government
abroad
as
may
seem
advisable
provision
being
definitely
made
however
as
now
for
the
amount
of
salary
attached
to
the
respective
stations
the
condition
of
our
finances
and
the
operations
of
the
various
branches
of
the
public
service
which
are
connected
with
the
treasury
department
are
very
fully
discussed
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
it
appears
that
the
ordinary
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
were
from
customs
from
internal
revenue
from
all
other
sources
total
ordinary
revenues
the
public
expenditures
during
the
same
period
were
for
civil
expenses
for
foreign
intercourse
for
indians
for
pensions
for
the
military
establishment
including
river
and
harbor
improvements
and
arsenals
for
the
naval
establishment
including
vessels
machinery
and
improvements
at
navyyards
for
miscellaneous
expenditures
including
public
buildings
lighthouses
and
collecting
the
revenue
for
expenditures
on
account
of
the
district
of
columbia
for
interest
on
the
public
debt
for
the
sinking
fund
total
ordinary
expenditures
leaving
a
surplus
of
as
compared
with
the
preceding
fiscal
year
there
was
a
net
decrease
of
over
in
the
amount
of
expenditures
the
aggregate
receipts
were
less
than
those
of
the
year
previous
by
about
the
falling
off
in
revenue
from
customs
made
up
nearly
of
this
deficiency
and
about
of
the
remainder
was
due
to
the
diminished
receipts
from
internal
taxation
the
secretary
estimates
the
total
receipts
for
the
fiscal
year
which
will
end
june
at
and
the
total
expenditures
at
in
which
sum
are
included
the
interest
on
the
debt
and
the
amount
payable
to
the
sinking
fund
this
would
leave
a
surplus
for
the
entire
year
of
about
the
value
of
exports
from
the
united
states
to
foreign
countries
during
the
year
ending
june
was
as
follows
domestic
merchandise
foreign
merchandise
total
merchandise
specie
total
exports
of
merchandise
and
specie
the
cotton
and
cotton
manufactures
included
in
this
statement
were
valued
at
the
breadstuffs
at
the
provisions
at
and
the
mineral
oils
at
during
the
same
period
the
imports
were
as
follows
merchandise
gold
and
silver
total
more
than
per
cent
of
the
entire
value
of
imported
merchandise
consisted
of
the
following
articles
sugar
and
molasses
wool
and
woolen
manufactures
silk
and
its
manufactures
coffee
iron
and
steel
and
manufactures
thereof
chemicals
flax
hemp
jute
and
like
substances
and
manufactures
thereof
cotton
and
manufactures
of
cotton
hides
and
skins
other
than
fur
skins
i
concur
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
recommending
the
immediate
suspension
of
the
coinage
of
silver
dollars
and
of
the
issuance
of
silver
certificates
this
is
a
matter
to
which
in
former
communications
i
have
more
than
once
invoked
the
attention
of
the
national
legislature
it
appears
that
annually
for
the
past
six
years
there
have
been
coined
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
act
of
february
more
than
silver
dollars
the
number
now
outstanding
is
reported
by
the
secretary
to
be
nearly
whereof
but
little
more
than
or
less
than
per
cent
are
in
actual
circulation
the
mere
existence
of
this
fact
seems
to
me
to
furnish
of
itself
a
cogent
argument
for
the
repeal
of
the
statute
which
has
made
such
fact
possible
but
there
are
other
and
graver
considerations
that
tend
in
the
same
direction
the
secretary
avows
his
conviction
that
unless
this
coinage
and
the
issuance
of
silver
certificates
be
suspended
silver
is
likely
at
no
distant
day
to
become
our
sole
metallic
standard
the
commercial
disturbance
and
the
impairment
of
national
credit
that
would
be
thus
occasioned
can
scarcely
be
overestimated
i
hope
that
the
secretarys
suggestions
respecting
the
withdrawal
from
circulation
of
the
and
notes
will
receive
your
approval
it
is
likely
that
a
considerable
portion
of
the
silver
now
encumbering
the
vaults
of
the
treasury
might
thus
find
its
way
into
the
currency
while
trade
dollars
have
ceased
for
the
present
at
least
to
be
an
element
of
active
disturbance
in
our
currency
system
some
provision
should
be
made
for
their
surrender
to
the
government
in
view
of
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
coined
and
of
the
fact
that
they
have
never
had
a
legaltender
quality
there
should
be
offered
for
them
only
a
slight
advance
over
their
bullion
value
the
secretary
in
the
course
of
his
report
considers
the
propriety
of
beautifying
the
designs
of
our
subsidiary
silver
coins
and
of
so
increasing
their
weight
that
they
may
bear
their
due
ratio
of
value
to
the
standard
dollar
his
conclusions
in
this
regard
are
cordially
approved
in
my
annual
message
of
i
recommended
the
abolition
of
all
excise
taxes
except
those
relating
to
distilled
spirits
this
recommendation
is
now
renewed
in
case
these
taxes
shall
be
abolished
the
revenues
that
will
still
remain
to
the
government
will
in
my
opinion
not
only
suffice
to
meet
its
reasonable
expenditures
but
will
afford
a
surplus
large
enough
to
permit
such
tariff
reduction
as
may
seem
to
be
advisable
when
the
results
of
recent
revenue
laws
and
commercial
treaties
shall
have
shown
in
what
quarters
those
reductions
can
be
most
judiciously
effected
one
of
the
gravest
of
the
problems
which
appeal
to
the
wisdom
of
congress
for
solution
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
most
effective
means
for
increasing
our
foreign
trade
and
thus
relieving
the
depression
under
which
our
industries
are
now
languishing
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
advises
that
the
duty
of
investigating
this
subject
be
intrusted
in
the
first
instance
to
a
competent
commission
while
fully
recognizing
the
considerations
that
may
be
urged
against
this
course
i
am
nevertheless
of
the
opinion
that
upon
the
whole
no
other
would
be
likely
to
effect
speedier
or
better
results
that
portion
of
the
secretarys
report
which
concerns
the
condition
of
our
shipping
interests
can
not
fail
to
command
your
attention
he
emphatically
recommends
that
as
an
incentive
to
the
investment
of
american
capital
in
american
steamships
the
government
shall
by
liberal
payments
for
mail
transportation
or
otherwise
lend
its
active
assistance
to
individual
enterprise
and
declares
his
belief
that
unless
that
course
be
pursued
our
foreign
carrying
trade
must
remain
as
it
is
today
almost
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
foreigners
one
phase
of
this
subject
is
now
especially
prominent
in
view
of
the
repeal
by
the
act
of
june
of
all
statutory
provisions
arbitrarily
compelling
american
vessels
to
carry
the
mails
to
and
from
the
united
states
as
it
is
necessary
to
make
provision
to
compensate
the
owners
of
such
vessels
for
performing
that
service
after
april
it
is
hoped
that
the
whole
subject
will
receive
early
consideration
that
will
lead
to
the
enactment
of
such
measures
for
the
revival
of
our
merchant
marine
as
the
wisdom
of
congress
may
devise
the
per
cent
bonds
of
the
government
to
the
amount
of
more
than
have
since
my
last
annual
message
been
redeemed
by
the
treasury
the
bonds
of
that
issue
still
outstanding
amount
to
little
over
about
onefourth
of
which
will
be
retired
through
the
operations
of
the
sinking
fund
during
the
coming
year
as
these
bonds
still
constitute
the
chief
basis
for
the
circulation
of
the
national
banks
the
question
how
to
avert
the
contraction
of
the
currency
caused
by
their
retirement
is
one
of
constantly
increasing
importance
it
seems
to
be
generally
conceded
that
the
law
governing
this
matter
exacts
from
the
banks
excessive
security
and
that
upon
their
present
bond
deposits
a
larger
circulation
than
is
now
allowed
may
be
granted
with
safety
i
hope
that
the
bill
which
passed
the
senate
at
the
last
session
permitting
the
issue
of
notes
equal
to
the
face
value
of
the
deposited
bonds
will
commend
itself
to
the
approval
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
expenses
of
the
war
department
the
secretary
reports
a
decrease
of
more
than
of
this
reduction
was
effected
in
the
expenditures
for
rivers
and
harbors
and
in
expenditures
for
the
quartermasters
department
outside
of
that
department
the
annual
expenses
of
all
the
army
bureaus
proper
except
possibly
the
ordnance
bureau
are
substantially
fixed
charges
which
can
not
be
materially
diminished
without
a
change
in
the
numerical
strength
of
the
army
the
expenditures
in
the
quartermasters
department
can
readily
be
subjected
to
administrative
discretion
and
it
is
reported
by
the
secretary
of
war
that
as
a
result
of
exercising
such
discretion
in
reducing
the
number
of
draft
and
pack
animals
in
the
army
the
annual
cost
of
supplying
and
caring
for
such
animals
is
now
less
than
it
was
in
the
reports
of
military
commanders
show
that
the
last
year
has
been
notable
for
its
entire
freedom
from
indian
outbreaks
in
defiance
of

of

sought
to

reported

favorably
to
the

of

by
one
of
its

is
still
pending
before
that
body
it
is
hoped
that
during
the
coming
session
the
measure
may
become
a
law
and
that
thereafter
immediate
steps
may
be
taken
to
secure
a
place
of
safe
deposit
for
these
valuable
collections
now
in
a
state
of
insecurity
the
funds
with
which
the
works
for
the
improvement
of
rivers
and
harbors
were
prosecuted
during
the
past
year
were
derived
from
the
appropriations
of
the
act
of
august
together
with
such
few
balances
as
were
on
hand
from
previous
appropriations
the

the
secretary
of
war
submits
the
report
of
the
chief
of
engineers
as
to
the
practicability
of
protecting
our
important
cities
on
the
seaboard
by
fortifications
and
other
defenses
able
to
repel
modern
methods
of
attack
the
time
has
now
come
when
such
defenses
can
be
prepared
with
confidence
that
they
will
not
prove
abortive
and
when
the
possible
result
of
delay
in
making
such
preparation
is
seriously
considered
delay
seems
inexcusable
for
the
most
important
citiesthose
whose
destruction
or
capture
would
be
a
national
humiliationadequate
defenses
inclusive
of
guns
may
be
made
by
the
gradual
expenditure
of
a
sum
much
less
than
a
victorious
enemy
could
levy
as
a
contribution
an
appropriation
of
about
onetenth
of
that
amount
is
asked
to
begin
the
work
and
i
concur
with
the
secretary
of
war
in
urging
that
it
be
granted
the
war
department
is
proceeding
with
the
conversion
of
inch
smoothbore
guns
into
inch
rifles
by
lining
the
former
with
tubes
of
forged
steel
or
of
coil
wrought
iron
fifty
guns
will
be
thus
converted
within
the
year
this
however
does
not
obviate
the
necessity
of
providing
means
for
the
construction
of
guns
of
the
highest
power
both
for
the
purposes
of
coast
defense
and
for
the
armament
of
war
vessels
the
report
of
the
gun
foundry
board
appointed
april
in
pursuance
of
the
act
of
march
was
transmitted
to
congress
in
a
special
message
of
february
in
my
message
of
march
i
called
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
board
that
the
government
should
encourage
the
production
at
private
steel
works
of
the
required
material
for
heavy
cannon
and
that
two
government
factories
one
for
the
army
and
one
for
the
navy
should
be
established
for
the
fabrication
of
guns
from
such
material
no
action
having
been
taken
the
board
was
subsequently
reconvened
to
determine
more
fully
the
plans
and
estimates
necessary
for
carrying
out
its
recommendation
it
has
received
information
which
indicates
that
there
are
responsible
steel
manufacturers
in
this
country
who
although
not
provided
at
present
with
the
necessary
plant
are
willing
to
construct
the
same
and
to
make
bids
for
contracts
with
the
government
for
the
supply
of
the
requisite
material
for
the
heaviest
guns
adapted
to
modern
warfare
if
a
guaranteed
order
of
sufficient
magnitude
accompanied
by
a
positive
appropriation
extending
over
a
series
of
years
shall
be
made
by
congress
all
doubts
as
to
the
feasibility
of
the
plan
being
thus
removed
i
renew
my
recommendation
that
such
action
be
taken
by
congress
as
will
enable
the
government
to
construct
its
own
ordnance
upon
its
own
territory
and
so
to
provide
the
armaments
demanded
by
considerations
of
national
safety
and
honor
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
exhibits
the
progress
which
has
been
made
on
the
new
steel
cruisers
authorized
by
the
acts
of
august
and
march
of
the
four
vessels
under
contract
one
the
chicago
of

more
than
half
finished
the

has
been
successfully
launched

the
boston
also
of

is
ready
for
launching
and
the
dolphin
a
dispatch
steamer
of
tons
is
ready
for
delivery
certain
adverse
criticisms
upon
the
designs
of
these
cruisers
are
discussed
by
the
secretary
who
insists
that
the
correctness
of
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
advisory
board
and
by
the
department
has
been
demonstrated
by
recent
developments
in
shipbuilding
abroad
the
machinery
of
the
doubleturreted
monitors
puritan
terror
and
amphitrite
contracted
for
under
the
act
of
march
is
in
process
of
construction
no
work
has
been
done
during
the
past
year
on
their
armor
for
lack
of
the
necessary
appropriations
a
fourth
monitor
the
monadnock
still
remains
unfinished
at
the
navyyard
in
california
it
is
recommended
that
early
steps
be
taken
to
complete
these
vessels
and
to
provide
also
an
armament
for
the
monitor
miantonomoh
the
recommendations
of
the
naval
advisory
board
approved
by

comprise
the
construction
of

the
general
designs
all
of
which
are
calculated
to
meet
the
existing
wants
of
the
service
are
now
well
advanced
and
the
construction
of
the
vessels
can
be
undertaken
as
soon
as
you
shall
grant
the
necessary
authority
the
act
of
congress
approved
august
authorized
the
removal
to
the

his
companions
of
the

has
been
successfully
accomplished
by

taken
from
their

and
were
retained
at
yakutsk
until
the
following

advanced
to
admit
of

they
arrived

suitable
honors

was
assigned
the
superintendence

the
entire

immediately
upon
its
arrival
at

began
the
dangerous
navigation
of
melville

and
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
reached
littleton
island
on
june
a
fortnight
earlier
than
any

had
before
attained
that
point
on
the
same
day
it
crossed
over
to
cape
sabine
where
lieutenant
greely
and
the
other
survivors
of
his

were
discovered
after
taking
on

the
bodies
of

ships
sailed
for

they
arrived

they
were
appropriately
received
at

with
the
exception
of
one
which
was
interred
in
the
national
cemetery
were
forwarded
thence
to
the
destinations
indicated
by
friends
the
organization
and
conduct
of
this
relief
expedition
reflects
great
credit
upon
all
who
contributed
to
its
success
in
this
the
last
of
the
stated
messages
that
i
shall
have
the
honor
to
transmit
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
i
can
not
too
strongly
urge
upon
its
attention
the
duty
of
restoring
our
navy
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
the
high
state
of
efficiency
which
formerly
characterized
it
as
the
long
peace
that
has
lulled
us
into
a
sense
of
fancied
security
may
at
any
time
be
disturbed
it
is
plain
that
the
policy
of
strengthening
this
arm
of
the
service
is
dictated
by
considerations
of
wise
economy
of
just
regard
for
our
future
tranquillity
and
of
true
appreciation
of
the
dignity
and
honor
of
the
republic
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
acquaints
you
with
the
present
condition
and
needs
of
the
postal
service
it
discloses
the
gratifying
fact
that
the
loss
of
revenue
from
the
reduction
in
the
rate
of
letter
postage
recommended
in
my
message
of
december
and
effected
by
the
act
of
march
has
been
much
less
than
was
generally
anticipated
my
recommendation
of
this
reduction
was
based
upon
the
belief
that
the
actual
falling
off
in
receipts
from
letter
postages
for
the
year
immediately
succeeding
the
change
of
rate
would
be
it
has
proved
to
be
only
this
is
a
trustworthy
indication
that
the
revenue
will
soon
be
restored
to
its
former
volume
by
the
natural
increase
of
sealed
correspondence
i
confidently
repeat
therefore
the
recommendation
of
my
last
annual
message
that
the
singlerate
postage
upon
drop
letters
be
reduced
to
cent
wherever
the
payment
of
cents
is
now
required
by
law
the
double
rate
is
only
exacted
at
offices
where
the
carrier
system
is
in
operation
and
it
appears
that
at
those
offices
the
increase
in
the
tax
upon
local
letters
defrays
the
cost
not
only
of
its
own
collection
and
delivery
but
of
the
collection
and
delivery
of
all
other
mail
matter
this
is
an
inequality
that
ought
no
longer
to
exist
i
approve
the
recommendation
of
the
postmastergeneral
that
the
unit
of
weight
in
the
rating
of
firstclass
matter
should
be
ounce
instead
of
onehalf
ounce
as
it
now
is
in
view
of
the
statistics
furnished
by
the
department
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
the
change
would
result
in
any
loss
of
revenue
that
it
would
greatly
promote
the
convenience
of
the
public
is
beyond
dispute
the
freedelivery
system
has
been
lately
applied
to
five
cities
and
the
total
number
of
offices
in
which
it
is
now
in
operation
is
experience
shows
that
its
adoption
under
proper
conditions
is
equally
an
accommodation
to
the
public
and
an
advantage
to
the
postal
service
it
is
more
than
selfsustaining
and
for
the
reasons
urged
by
the
postmastergeneral
may
properly
be
extended
in
the
opin
ion
of
that
officer
it
is
important
to
provide
means
whereby
exceptional
dispatch
in
dealing
with
letters
in
freedelivery
offices
may
be
secured
by
payment
of
extraordinary
postage
this
scheme
might
be
made
effective
by
employment
of
a
special
stamp
whose
cost
should
be
commensurate
with
the
expense
of
the
extra
service
in
some
of
the
large
cities
private
express
companies
have
undertaken
to
outstrip
the
government
mail
carriers
by
affording
for
the
prompt
transmission
of
letters
better
facilities
than
have
hitherto
been
at
the
command
of
the
postoffice
it
has
always
been
the
policy
of
the
government
to
discourage
such
enterprises
and
in
no
better
mode
can
that
policy
be
maintained
than
in
supplying
the
public
with
the
most
efficient
mail
service
that
with
due
regard
to
its
own
best
interests
can
be
furnished
for
its
accommodation
the
attorneygeneral
renews
the
recommendation
contained
in
his
report
of
last
year
touching
the
fees
of
witnesses
and
jurors
he
favors
radical
changes
in
the
fee
bill
the
adoption
of
a
system
by
which
attorneys
and
marshals
of
the
united
states
shall
be
compensated
solely
by
salaries
and
the
erection
by
the
government
of
a
penitentiary
for
the
confinement
of
offenders
against
its
laws
of
the
varied
governmental
concerns
in
charge
of
the
interior
department
the
report
of
its
secretary
presents
an
interesting
summary
among
the
topics
deserving
particular
attention
i
refer
you
to
his
observations
respecting
our
indian
affairs
the
preemption
and
timberculture
acts
the
failure
of
railroad
companies
to
take
title
to
lands
granted
by
the
government
and
the
operations
of
the
pension
office
the
patent
office
the
census
bureau
and
the
bureau
of
education
allusion
has
been
made
already
to
the
circumstance
that
both
as
between
the
different
indian
tribes
and
as
between
the
indians
and
the
whites
the
past
year
has
been
one
of
unbroken
peace
in
this
circumstance
the
president
is
glad
to
find
justification
for
the
policy
of
the
government
in
its
dealing
with
the
indian
question
and
confirmation
of
the
views
which
were
fully
expressed
in
his
first
communication
to
the
fortyseventh
congress
the
secretary
urges
anew
the
enactment
of
a
statute
for
the
punishment
of
crimes
committed
on
the
indian
reservations
and
recommends
the
passage
of
the
bill
now
pending
in
the
house
of
representatives
for
the
purchase
of
a
tract
of
square
miles
from
the
sioux
reservation
both
these
measures
are
worthy
of
approval
i
concur
with
him
also
in
advising
the
repeal
of
the
preemption
law
the
enactment
of
statutes
resolving
the
present
legal
complications
touching
lapsed
grants
to
railroad
companies
and
the
funding
of
the
debt
of
the
several
pacific
railroads
under
such
guaranty
as
shall
effectually
secure
its
ultimate
payment
the
report
of
the
utah
commission
will
be
read
with
interest
it
discloses
the
results
of
recent
legislation
looking
to
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
polygamy
in
that
territory
i
still
believe
that
if
that
abominable
practice
can
be
suppressed
by
law
it
can
only
be
by
the
most
radical
legislation
consistent
with
the
restraints
of
the
constitution
i
again
recommend
therefore
that
congress
assume
absolute
political
control
of
the
territory
of
utah
and
provide
for
the
appointment
of
commissioners
with
such
governmental
powers
as
in
its
judgment
may
justly
and
wisely
be
put
into
their
hands
in
the
course
of
this
communication
reference
has
more
than
once
been
made
to
the
policy
of
this
government
as
regards
the
extension
of
our
foreign
trade
it
seems
proper
to
declare
the
general
principles
that
should
in
my
opinion
underlie
our
national
efforts
in
this
direction
the
main
conditions
of
the
problem
may
be
thus
stated
we
are
a
people
apt
in
mechanical
pursuits
and
fertile
in
invention
we
cover
a
vast
extent
of
territory
rich
in
agricultural
products
and
in
nearly
all
the
raw
materials
necessary
for
successful
manufacture
we
have
a
system
of
productive
establishments
more
than
sufficient
to
supply
our
own
demands
the
wages
of
labor
are
nowhere
else
so
great
the
scale
of
living
of
our
artisan
classes
is
such
as
tends
to
secure
their
personal
comfort
and
the
development
of
those
higher
moral
and
intellectual
qualities
that
go
to
the
making
of
good
citizens
our
system
of
tax
and
tariff
legislation
is
yielding
a
revenue
which
is
in
excess
of
the
present
needs
of
the
government
these
are
the
elements
from
which
it
is
sought
to
devise
a
scheme
by
which
without
unfavorably
changing
the
condition
of
the
workingman
our
merchant
marine
shall
be
raised
from
its
enfeebled
condition
and
new
markets
provided
for
the
sale
beyond
our
borders
of
the
manifold
fruits
of
our
industrial
enterprises
the
problem
is
complex
and
can
be
solved
by
no
single
measure
of
innovation
or
reform
the
countries
of
the
american
continent
and
the
adjacent
islands
are
for
the
united
states
the
natural
marts
of
supply
and
demand
it
is
from
them
that
we
should
obtain
what
we
do
not
produce
or
do
not
produce
in
sufficiency
and
it
is
to
them
that
the
surplus
productions
of
our
fields
our
mills
and
our
workshops
should
flow
under
conditions
that
will
equalize
or
favor
them
in
comparison
with
foreign
competition
four
paths
of
policy
seem
to
point
to
this
end
first
a
series
of
reciprocal
commercial
treaties
with
the
countries
of
america
which
shall
foster
between
us
and
them
an
unhampered
movement
of
trade
the
conditions
of
these
treaties
should
be
the
free
admission
of
such
merchandise
as
this
country
does
not
produce
in
return
for
the
admission
free
or
under
a
favored
scheme
of
duties
of
our
own
products
the
benefits
of
such
exchange
to
apply
only
to
goods
carried
under
the
flag
of
the
parties
to
the
contract
the
removal
on
both
sides
from
the
vessels
so
privileged
of
all
tonnage
dues
and
national
imposts
so
that
those
vessels
may
ply
unhindered
between
our
ports
and
those
of
the
other
contracting
parties
though
without
infringing
on
the
reserved
home
coasting
trade
the
removal
or
reduction
of
burdens
on
the
exported
products
of
those
countries
coming
within
the
benefits
of
the
treaties
and
the
avoidance
of
the
technical
restrictions
and
penalties
by
which
our
intercourse
with
those
countries
is
at
present
hampered
secondly
the
establishment
of
the
consular
service
of
the
united
states
on
a
salaried
footing
thus
permitting
the
relinquishment
of
consular
fees
not
only
as
respects
vessels
under
the
national
flag
but
also
as
respects
vessels
of
the
treaty
nations
carrying
goods
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
treaties
thirdly
the
enactment
of
measures
to
favor
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
a
steam
carrying
marine
under
the
flag
of
the
united
states
fourthly
the
establishment
of
an
uniform
currency
basis
for
the
countries
of
america
so
that
the
coined
products
of
our
mines
may
circulate
on
equal
terms
throughout
the
whole
system
of
commonwealths
this
would
require
a
monetary
union
of
america
whereby
the
output
of
the
bullionproducing
countries
and
the
circulation
of
those
which
yield
neither
gold
nor
silver
could
be
adjusted
in
conformity
with
the
population
wealth
and
commercial
needs
of
each
as
many
of
the
countries
furnish
no
bullion
to
the
common
stock
the
surplus
production
of
our
mines
and
mints
might
thus
be
utilized
and
a
step
taken
toward
the
general
remonetization
of
silver
to
the
accomplishment
of
these
ends
so
far
as
they
can
be
attained
by
separate
treaties
the
negotiations
already
concluded
and
now
in
progress
have
been
directed
and
the
favor
which
this
enlarged
policy
has
thus
far
received
warrants
the
belief
that
its
operations
will
ere
long
embrace
all
or
nearly
all
the
countries
of
this
hemisphere
it
is
by
no
means
desirable
however
that
the
policy
under
consideration
should
be
applied
to
these
countries
alone
the
healthful
enlargement
of
our
trade
with
europe
asia
and
africa
should
be
sought
by
reducing
tariff
burdens
on
such
of
their
wares
as
neither
we
nor
the
other
american
states
are
fitted
to
produce
and
thus
enabling
ourselves
to
obtain
in
return
a
better
market
for
our
supplies
of
food
of
raw
materials
and
of
the
manufactures
in
which
we
excel
it
seems
to
me
that
many
of
the
embarrassing
elements
in
the
great
national
conflict
between
protection
and
free
trade
may
thus
be
turned
to
good
account
that
the
revenue
may
be
reduced
so
as
no
longer
to
overtax
the
people
that
protective
duties
may
be
retained
without
becoming
burdensome
that
our
shipping
interests
may
be
judiciously
encouraged
the
currency
fixed
on
firm
bases
and
above
all
such
an
unity
of
interests
established
among
the
states
of
the
american
system
as
will
be
of
great
and
everincreasing
advantage
to
them
all
all
treaties
in
the
line
of
this
policy
which
have
been
negotiated
or
are
in
process
of
negotiation
contain
a
provision
deemed
to
be
requisite
under
the
clause
of
the
constitution
limiting
to
the
house
of
representatives
the
authority
to
originate
bills
for
raising
revenue
on
the
th
of
february
last
i
transmitted
to
the
congress
the
first
annual
report
of
the
civil
service
commission
together
with
communications
from
the
heads
of
the
several
executive
departments
of
the
government
respecting
the
practical
workings
of
the
law
under
which
the
commission
had
been
acting
the
good
results
therein
foreshadowed
have
been
more
than
realized
the
system
has
fully
answered
the
expectations
of
its
friends
in
securing
competent
and
faithful
public
servants
and
in
protecting
the
appointing
officers
of
the
government
from
the
pressure
of
personal
importunity
and
from
the
labor
of
examining
the
claims
and
pretensions
of
rival
candidates
for
public
employment
the
law
has
had
the
unqualified
support
of
the
president
and
of
the
heads
of
the
several
departments
and
the
members
of
the
commission
have
performed
their
duties
with
zeal
and
fidelity
their
report
will
shortly
be
submitted
and
will
be
accompanied
by
such
recommendations
for
enlarging
the
scope
of
the
existing
statute
as
shall
commend
themselves
to
the
executive
and
the
commissioners
charged
with
its
administration

in
view
of
the
general
and
persistent
demand
throughout
the
commercial
community
for
a
national
bankrupt
law
i
hope
that
the
differences
of
sentiment
which
have
hitherto
prevented
its
enactment
may
not
outlast
the
present
session
the
pestilence
which
for
the
past
two
years
has
been
raging
in
the
countries
of
the
east
recently
made
its
appearance
in
european
ports
with
which
we
are
in
constant
communication
the
then
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
pursuance
of
a
proclamation
of
the
president
issued
certain
regulations
restricting
and
for
a
time
prohibiting
the
importation
of
rags
and
the
admission
of
baggage
of
immigrants
and
of
travelers
arriving
from
infected
quarters
lest
this
course
may
have
been
without
strict
warrant
of
law
i
approve
the
recommendation
of
the
present
secretary
that
the
congress
take
action
in
the
premises
and
i
also
recommend
the
immediate
adoption
of
such
measures
as
will
be
likely
to
ward
off
the
dreaded
epidemic
and
to
mitigate
its
severity
in
case
it
shall
unhappily
extend
to
our
shores
the
annual
report
of
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia
reviews
the
operations
of
the
several
departments
of
its
municipal
government
i
ask
your
careful
consideration
of
its
suggestions
in
respect
to
legislation
especially
commending
such
as
relate
to
a
revision
of
the
civil
and
criminal
code
the
performance
of
labor
by
persons
sentenced
to
imprisonment
in
the
jail
the
construction
and
occupation
of
wharves
along
the
river
front
and
the
erection
of
a
suitable
building
for
district
offices
i
recommend
that
in
recognition
of
the
eminent
services
of
ulysses
s
grant
late
general
of
the
armies
of
the
united
states
and
twice
president
of
this
nation
the
congress
confer
upon
him
a
suitable
pension
certain
of
the
measures
that
seem
to
me
necessary
and
expedient
i
have
now
in
obedience
to
the
constitution
recommended
for
your
adoption
as
respects
others
of
no
less
importance
i
shall
content
myself
with
renewing
the
recommendations
already
made
to
the
congress
without
restating
the
grounds
upon
which
such
recommendations
were
based
the
preservation
of
forests
on
the
public
domain
the
granting
of
government
aid
for
popular
education
the
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
so
as
to
make
effective
the
disapproval
by
the
president
of
particular
items
in
appropriation
bills
the
enactment
of
statutes
in
regard
to
the
filling
of
vacancies
in
the
presidential
office
and
the
determining
of
vexed
questions
respecting
presidential
inability
are
measures
which
may
justly
receive
your
serious
consideration
as
the
time
draws
nigh
when
i
am
to
retire
from
the
public
service
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
to
the
members
of
the
national
legislature
with
whom
i
have
been
brought
into
personal
and
official
intercourse
my
sincere
appreciation
of
their
unfailing
courtesy
and
of
their
harmonious
cooperation
with
the
executive
in
so
many
measures
calculated
to
promote
the
best
interests
of
the
nation
and
to
my
fellowcitizens
generally
i
acknowledge
a
deep
sense
of
obligation
for
the
support
which
they
have
accorded
me
in
my
administration
of
the
executive
department
of
this
government

to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
at
the
threshold
of
your
deliberations
i
congratulate
you
upon
the
favorable
aspect
of
the
domestic
and
foreign
affairs
of
this
government
our
relations
with
other
countries
continue
to
be
upon
a
friendly
footing
with
the
argentine
republic
austria
belgium
brazil
denmark
hayti
italy
santo
domingo
and
sweden
and
norway
no
incident
has
occurred
which
calls
for
special
comment
the
recent
opening
of
new
lines
of
telegraphic
communication
with
central
america
and
brazil
permitted
the
interchange
of
messages
of
friendship
with
the
governments
of
those
countries
during
the
year
there
have
been
perfected
and
proclaimed
consular
and
commercial
treaties
with
servia
and
a
consular
treaty
with
roumania
thus
extending
our
intercourse
with
the
danubian
countries
while
our
eastern
relations
have
been
put
upon
a
wider
basis
by
treaties
with
korea
and
madagascar
the
new
boundarysurvey
treaty
with
mexico
a
trademarks
convention
and
a
supplementary
treaty
of
extradition
with
spain
and
conventions
extending
the
duration
of
the
francoamerican
claims
commission
have
also
been
proclaimed
notice
of
the
termination
of
the
fisheries
articles
of
the
treaty
of
washington
was
duly
given
to
the
british
government
and
the
reciprocal
privileges
and
exemptions
of
the
treaty
will
accordingly
cease
on
july
the
fisheries
industries
pursued
by
a
numerous
class
of
our
citizens
on
the
northern
coasts
both
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
are
worthy
of
the
fostering
care
of
congress
whenever
brought
into
competition
with
the
like
industries
of
other
countries
our
fishermen
as
well
as
our
manufacturers
of
fishing
appliances
and
preparers
of
fish
products
have
maintained
a
foremost
place
i
suggest
that
congress
create
a
commission
to
consider
the
general
question
of
our
rights
in
the
fisheries
and
the
means
of
opening
to
our
citizens
under
just
and
enduring
conditions
the
richly
stocked
fishing
waters
and
sealing
grounds
of
british
north
america
question
has
arisen
touching
the
deportation
to
the
united
states
from
the
british
islands
by
governmental
or
municipal
aid
of
persons
unable
there
to
gain
a
living
and
equally
a
burden
on
the
community
here
such
of
these
persons
as
fall
under
the
pauper
class
as
defined
by
law
have
been
sent
back
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
our
statutes
her
majestys
government
has
insisted
that
precautions
have
been
taken
before
shipment
to
prevent
these
objectionable
visitors
from
coming
hither
without
guaranty
of
support
by
their
relatives
in
this
country
the
action
of
the
british
authorities
in
applying
measures
for
relief
has
however
in
so
many
cases
proved
ineffectual
and
especially
so
in
certain
recent
instances
of
needy
emigrants
reaching
our
territory
through
canada
that
a
revision
of
our
legislation
upon
this
subject
may
be
deemed
advisable
correspondence
relative
to
the
claytonbulwer
treaty
has
been
continued
and
will
be
laid
before
congress
the
legislation
of
france
against
the
importation
of
prepared
swine
products
from
the
united
states
has
been
repealed
that
result
is
due
no
less
to
the
friendly
representations
of
this
government
than
to
a
growing
conviction
in
france
that
the
restriction
was
not
demanded
by
any
real
danger
to
health
germany
still
prohibits
the
introduction
of
all
swine
products
from
america
i
extended
to
the
imperial
government
a
friendly
invitation
to
send
experts
to
the
united
states
to
inquire
whether
the
use
of
those
products
was
dangerous
to
health
this
invitation
was
declined
i
have
believed
it
of
such
importance
however
that
the
exact
facts
should
be
ascertained
and
promulgated
that
i
have
appointed
a
competent
commission
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
subject
its
members
have
shown
their
public
spirit
by
accepting
their
trust
without
pledge
of
compensation
but
i
trust
that
congress
will
see
in
the
national
and
international
bearings
of
the
matter
a
sufficient
motive
for
providing
at
least
for
reimbursement
of
such
expenses
as
they
may
necessarily
incur
the
coronation
of
the
czar
at
moscow
afforded
to
this
government
an
occasion
for
testifying
its
continued
friendship
by
sending
a
special
envoy
and
a
representative
of
the
navy
to
attend
the
ceremony
while
there
have
arisen
during
the
year
no
grave
questions
affecting
the
status
in
the
russian
empire
of
american
citizens
of
other
faith
than
that
held
by
the
national
church
this
government
remains
firm
in
its
conviction
that
the
rights
of
its
citizens
abroad
should
be
in
no
wise
affected
by
their
religious
belief
it
is
understood
that
measures
for
the
removal
of
the
restrictions
which
now
burden
our
trade
with
cuba
and
puerto
rico
are
under
consideration
by
the
spanish
government
the
proximity
of
cuba
to
the
united
states
and
the
peculiar
methods
of
administration
which
there
prevail
necessitate
constant
discussion
and
appeal
on
our
part
from
the
proceedings
of
the
insular
authorities
i
regret
to
say
that
the
just
protests
of
this
government
have
not
as
yet
produced
satisfactory
results
the
commission
appointed
to
decide
certain
claims
of
our
citizens
against
the
spanish
government
after
the
recognition
of
a
satisfactory
rule
as
to
the
validity
and
force
of
naturalization
in
the
united
states
has
finally
adjourned
some
of
its
awards
though
made
more
than
two
years
ago
have
not
yet
been
paid
their
speedy
payment
is
expected
claims
to
a
large
amount
which
were
held
by
the
late
commission
to
be
without
its
jurisdiction
have
been
diplomatically
presented
to
the
spanish
government
as
the
action
of
the
colonial
authorities
which
has
given
rise
to
these
claims
was
admittedly
illegal
full
reparation
for
the
injury
sustained
by
our
citizens
should
be
no
longer
delayed
the
case
of
the
masonic
has
not
yet
reached
a
settlement
manila
court
has
found
that
the
proceedings
of
which
this
government
has
complained
were
unauthorized
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
government
of
spain
will
not
withhold
the
speedy
reparation
which
its
sense
of
justice
should
impel
it
to
offer
for
the
unusual
severity
and
unjust
action
of
its
subordinate
colonial
officers
in
the
case
of
this
vessel
the
helvetian
confederation
has
proposed
the
inauguration
of
a
class
of
international
treaties
for
the
referment
to
arbitration
of
grave
questions
between
nations
this
government
has
assented
to
the
proposed
negotiation
of
such
a
treaty
with
switzerland
under
the
treaty
of
berlin
liberty
of
conscience
and
civil
rights
are
assured
to
all
strangers
in
bulgaria
as
the
united
states
have
no
distinct
conventional
relations
with
that
country
and
are
not
a
party
to
the
treaty
they
should
in
my
opinion
maintain
diplomatic
representation
at
sofia
for
the
improvement
of
intercourse
and
the
proper
protection
of
the
many
american
citizens
who
resort
to
that
country
as
missionaries
and
teachers
i
suggest
that
i
be
given
authority
to
establish
an
agency
and
consulategeneral
at
the
bulgarian
capital
the
united
states
are
now
participating
in
a
revision
of
the
tariffs
of
the
ottoman
empire
they
have
assented
to
the
application
of
a
license
tax
to
foreigners
doing
business
in
turkey
but
have
opposed
the
oppressive
storage
tax
upon
petroleum
entering
the
ports
of
that
country
the
government
of
the
khedive
has
proposed
that
the
authority
of
the
mixed
judicial
tribunals
in
egypt
be
extended
so
as
to
cover
citizens
of
the
united
states
accused
of
crime
who
are
now
triable
before
consular
courts
this
government
is
not
indisposed
to
accept
the
change
but
believes
that
its
terms
should
be
submitted
for
criticism
to
the
commission
appointed
to
revise
the
whole
subject
at
no
time
in
our
national
history
has
there
been
more
manifest
need
of
close
and
lasting
relations
with
a
neighboring
state
than
now
exists
with
respect
to
mexico
the
rapid
influx
of
our
capital
and
enterprise
into
that
country
shows
by
what
has
already
been
accomplished
the
vast
reciprocal
advantages
which
must
attend
the
progress
of
its
internal
development
the
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
of
has
been
terminated
by
the
mexican
government
and
in
the
absence
of
conventional
engagements
the
rights
of
our
citizens
in
mexico
now
depend
upon
the
domestic
statutes
of
that
republic
there
have
been
instances
of
harsh
enforcement
of
the
laws
against
our
vessels
and
citizens
in
mexico
and
of
denial
of
the
diplomatic
resort
for
their
protection
the
initial
step
toward
a
better
understanding
has
been
taken
in
the
negotiation
by
the
commission
authorized
by
congress
of
a
treaty
which
is
still
before
the
senate
awaiting
its
approval
the
provisions
for
the
reciprocal
crossing
of
the
frontier
by
the
troops
in
pursuit
of
hostile
indians
have
been
prolonged
for
another
year
the
operations
of
the
forces
of
both
governments
against
these
savages
have
been
successful
and
several
of
their
most
dangerous
bands
have
been
captured
or
dispersed
by
the
skill
and
valor
of
united
states
and
mexican
soldiers
fighting
in
a
common
cause
the
convention
for
the
resurvey
of
the
boundary
from
the
rio
grande
to
the
pacific
having
been
ratified
and
exchanged
the
preliminary
reconnoissance
therein
stipulated
has
been
effected
it
now
rests
with
congress
to
make
provision
for
completing
the
survey
and
relocating
the
boundary
monuments
a
convention
was
signed
with
mexico
on
july
providing
for
the
rehearing
of
the
cases
of
benjamin
well
and
the
abra
silver
mining
company
in
whose
favor
awards
were
made
by
the
late
american
and
mexican
claims
commission
that
convention
still
awaits
the
consent
of
the
senate
meanwhile
because
of
those
charges
of
fraudulent
awards
which
have
made
a
new
commission
necessary
the
executive
has
directed
the
suspension
of
payments
of
the
distributive
quota
received
from
mexico
our
geographical
proximity
to
central
america
and
our
political
and
commercial
relations
with
the
states
of
that
country
justify
in
my
judgment
such
a
material
increase
of
our
consular
corps
as
will
place
at
each
capital
a
consulgeneral
the
contest
between
bolivia
chile
and
peru
has
passed
from
the
stage
of
strategic
hostilities

to
that
of
negotiation
in
which
the
counsels
of
this
government
have
been
exercised
the
demands
of
chile
for
absolute
cession
of
territory
have
been
maintained
and
accepted
by
the
party
of
general
iglesias
to
the
extent
of
concluding
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
government
of
chile
in
general
conformity
with
the
terms
of
the
protocol
signed
in
may
last
between
the
chilean
commander
and
general
iglesias
as
a
result
of
the
conclusion
of
this
treaty
general
iglesias
has
been
formally
recognized
by
chile
as
president
of
peru
and
his
government
installed
at
lima
which
has
been
evacuated
by
the
chileans
a
call
has
been
issued
by
general
iglesias
for
a
representative
assembly
to
be
elected
on
the
th
of
january
and
to
meet
at
lima
on
the
st
of
march
next
meanwhile
the
provisional
government
of
general
iglesias
has
applied
for
recognition
to
the
principal
powers
of
america
and
europe
when
the
will
of
the
peruvian
people
shall
be
manifested
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
recognize
the
government
approved
by
them
diplomatic
and
naval
representatives
of
this
government
attended
at
caracas
the
centennial
celebration
of
the
birth
of
the
illustrious
bolivar
at
the
same
time
the
inauguration
of
the
statue
of
washington
in
the
venezuelan
capital
testified
to
the
veneration
in
which
his
memory
is
there
held
congress
at
its
last
session
authorized
the
executive
to
propose
to
venezuela
a
reopening
of
the
awards
of
the
mixed
commission
of
caracas
the
departure
from
this
country
of
the
venezuelan
minister
has
delayed
the
opening
of
negotiations
for
reviving
the
commission
this
government
holds
that
until
the
establishment
of
a
treaty
upon
this
subject
the
venezuelan
government
must
continue
to
make
the
payments
provided
for
in
the
convention
of
there
is
ground
for
believing
that
the
dispute
growing
out
of
the
unpaid
obligations
due
from
venezuela
to
france
will
be
satisfactorily
adjusted
the
french
cabinet
has
proposed
a
basis
of
settlement
which
meets
my
approval
but
as
it
involves
a
recasting
of
the
annual
quotas
of
the
foreign
debt
it
has
been
deemed
advisable
to
submit
the
proposal
to
the
judgment
of
the
cabinets
of
berlin
copenhagen
the
hague
london
and
madrid
at
the
recent
coronation
of
his
majesty
king
kalakaua
this
government
was
represented
both
diplomatically
and
by
the
formal
visit
of
a
vessel
of
war
the
question
of
terminating
or
modifying
the
existing
reciprocity
treaty
with
hawaii
is
now
before
congress
i
am
convinced
that
the
charges
of
abuses
and
frauds
under
that
treaty
have
been
exaggerated
and
i
renew
the
suggestion
of
last
years
message
that
the
treaty
be
modified
wherever
its
provisions
have
proved
onerous
to
legitimate
trade
between
the
two
countries
i
am
not
disposed
to
favor
the
entire
cessation
of
the
treaty
relations
which
have
fostered
good
will
between
the
countries
and
contributed
toward
the
equality
of
hawaii
in
the
family
of
nations
in
pursuance
of
the
policy
declared
by
this
government
of
extending
our
intercourse
with
the
eastern
nations
legations
have
during
the
past
year
been
established
in
persia
siam
and
korea
it
is
probable
that
permanent
missions
of
those
countries
will
ere
long
be
maintained
in
the
united
states
a
special
embassy
from
siam
is
now
on
its
way
hither
treaty
relations
with
korea
were
perfected
by
the
exchange
at
seoul
on
the
th
of
may
last
of
the
ratifications
of
the
lately
concluded
convention
and
envoys
from
the
king
of
chosen
have
visited
this
country
and
received
a
cordial
welcome
korea
as
yet
unacquainted
with
the
methods
of
western
civilization
now
invites
the
attention
of
those
interested
in
the
advancement
of
our
foreign
trade
as
it
needs
the
implements
and
products
which
the
united
states
are
ready
to
supply
we
seek
no
monopoly
of
its
commerce
and
no
advantages
over
other
nations
but
as
the
chosenese
in
reaching
for
a
higher
civilization
have
confided
in
this
republic
we
can
not
regard
with
indifference
any
encroachment
on
their
rights
china
by
the
payment
of
a
money
indemnity
has
settled
certain
of
the
longpending
claims
of
our
citizens
and
i
have
strong
hopes
that
the
remainder
will
soon
be
adjusted
questions
have
arisen
touching
the
rights
of
american
and
other
foreign
manufacturers
in
china
under
the
provisions
of
treaties
which
permit
aliens
to
exercise
their
industries
in
that
country
on
this
specific
point
our
own
treaty
is
silent
but
under
the
operation
of
the
mostfavorednation
clause
we
have
like
privileges
with
those
of
other
powers
while
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
to
see
that
our
citizens
have
the
full
enjoyment
of
every
benefit
secured
by
treaty
i
doubt
the
expediency
of
leading
in
a
movement
to
constrain
china
to
admit
an
interpretation
which
we
have
only
an
indirect
treaty
right
to
exact
the
transference
to
china
of
american
capital
for
the
employment
there
of
chinese
labor
would
in
effect
inaugurate
a
competition
for
the
control
of
markets
now
supplied
by
our
home
industries
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
law
restricting
the
immigration
of
chinese
has
been
violated
intentionally
or
otherwise
by
the
officials
of
china
upon
whom
is
devolved
the
duty
of
certifying
that
the
immigrants
belong
to
the
excepted
classes
measures
have
been
taken
to
ascertain
the
facts
incident
to
this
supposed
infraction
and
it
is
believed
that
the
government
of
china
will
cooperate
with
the
united
states
in
securing
the
faithful
observance
of
the
law
the
same
considerations
which
prompted
congress
at
its
last
session
to
return
to
japan
the
simonoseki
indemnity
seem
to
me
to
require
at
its
hands
like
action
in
respect
to
the
canton
indemnity
fund
now
amounting
to
the
question
of
the
general
revision
of
the
foreign
treaties
of
japan
has
been
considered
in
an
international
conference
held
at
tokyo
but
without
definite
result
as
yet
this
government
is
disposed
to
concede
the
requests
of
japan
to
determine
its
own
tariff
duties
to
provide
such
proper
judicial
tribunals
as
may
commend
themselves
to
the
western
powers
for
the
trial
of
causes
to
which
foreigners
are
parties
and
to
assimilate
the
terms
and
duration
of
its
treaties
to
those
of
other
civilized
states
through
our
ministers
at
london
and
at
monrovia
this
government
has
endeavored
to
aid
liberia
in
its
differences
with
great
britain
touching
the
northwestern
boundary
of
that
republic
there
is
a
prospect
of
adjustment
of
the
dispute
by
the
adoption
of
the
mannah
river
as
the
line
this
arrangement
is
a
compromise
of
the
conflicting
territorial
claims
and
takes
from
liberia
no
country
over
which
it
has
maintained
effective
jurisdiction
the
rich
and
populous
valley
of
the
kongo
is
being
opened
to
commerce
by
a
society
called
the
international
african
association
of
which
the
king
of
the
belgians
is
the
president
and
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
the
chief
executive
officer
large
tracts
of
territory
have
been
ceded
to
the
association
by
native
chiefs
roads
have
been
opened
steamboats
placed
on
the
river
and
the
nuclei
of
states
established
at
twentytwo
stations
under
one
flag
which
offers
freedom
to
commerce
and
prohibits
the
slave
trade
the
objects
of
the
society
are
philanthropic
it
does
not
aim
at
permanent
political
control
but
seeks
the
neutrality
of
the
valley
the
united
states
can
not
be
indifferent
to
this
work
nor
to
the
interests
of
their
citizens
involved
in
it
it
may
become
advisable
for
us
to
cooperate
with
other
commercial
powers
in
promoting
the
rights
of
trade
and
residence
in
the
kongo
valley
free
from
the
interference
or
political
control
of
any
one
nation
in
view
of
the
frequency
of
invitations
from
foreign
governments
to
participate
in
social
and
scientific
congresses
for
the
discussion
of
important
matters
of
general
concern
i
repeat
the
suggestion
of
my
last
message
that
provision
be
made
for
the
exercise
of
discretionary
power
by
the
executive
in
appointing
delegates
to
such
convocations
able
specialists
are
ready
to
serve
the
national
interests
in
such
capacity
without
personal
profit
or
other
compensation
than
the
defrayment
of
expenses
actually
incurred
and
this
a
comparatively
small
annual
appropriation
would
suffice
to
meet
i
have
alluded
in
my
previous
messages
to
the
injurious
and
vexatious
restrictions
suffered
by
our
trade
in
the
spanish
west
indies
brazil
whose
natural
outlet
for
its
great
national
staple
coffee
is
in
and
through
the
united
states
imposes
a
heavy
export
duty
upon
that
product
our
petroleum
exports
are
hampered
in
turkey
and
in
other
eastern
ports
by
restrictions
as
to
storage
and
by
onerous
taxation
for
these
mischiefs
adequate
relief
is
not
always
afforded
by
reciprocity
treaties
like
that
with
hawaii
or
that
lately
negotiated
with
mexico
and
now
awaiting
the
action
of
the
senate
is
it
not
advisable
to
provide
some
measure
of
equitable
retaliation
in
our
relations
with
governments
which
discriminate
against
our
own
if
for
example
the
executive
were
empowered
to
apply
to
spanish
vessels
and
cargoes
from
cuba
and
puerto
rico
the
same
rules
of
treatment
and
scale
of
penalties
for
technical
faults
which
are
applied
to
our
vessels
and
cargoes
in
the
antilles
a
resort
to
that
course
might
not
be
barren
of
good
results
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the

gives
a
full

interesting

in

the
events

has
elapsed
since
the
commencement
of
your
sessions
i
first
call
your
attention
to
the
gratifying
condition
of
our
foreign
affairs
our
intercourse
with
other
powers
has
continued
to
be
of
the
most
friendly
character
such
slight
differences
as
have
arisen
during
the
year
have
been
already
settled
or
are
likely
to
reach
an
early
adjustment
the
arrest
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
ireland
under
recent
laws
which
owe
their
origin
to
the
disturbed
condition
of
that
country
has
led
to
a
somewhat
extended
correspondence
with
the
government
of
great
britain
a
disposition
to
respect
our
rights
has
been
practically
manifested
by
the
release
of
the
arrested
parties
the
claim
of
this
nation
in
regard
to
the
supervision
and
control
of
any
interoceanic
canal
across
the
american
isthmus
has
continued
to
be
the
subject
of
conference
it
is
likely
that
time
will
be
more
powerful
than
discussion
in
removing
the
divergence
between
the
two
nations
whose
friendship
is
so
closely
cemented
by
the
intimacy
of
their
relations
and
the
community
of
their
interests
our
longestablished
friendliness
with
russia
has
remained
unshaken
it
has
prompted
me
to
proffer
the
earnest
counsels
of
this
government
that
measures
be
adopted
for
suppressing
the
proscription
which
the
hebrew
race
in
that
country
has
lately
suffered
it
has
not
transpired
that
any
american
citizen
has
been
subjected
to
arrest
or
injury
but
our
courteous
remonstrance
has
nevertheless
been
courteously
received
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
russia
will
be
able
to
secure
toleration
to
all
faiths
within
her
borders
at
an
international
convention
held
at
paris
in
and
attended
by
representatives
of
the
united
states
an
agreement
was
reached
in
respect
to
the
protection
of
trademarks
patented
articles
and
the
rights
of
manufacturing
firms
and
corporations
the
formulating
into
treaties
of
the
recommendations
thus
adopted
is
receiving
the
attention
which
it
merits
the
protection
of
submarine
cables
is
a
subject
now
under
consideration
by
an
international
conference
at
paris
believing
that
it
is
clearly
the
true
policy
of
this
government
to
favor
the
neutralization
of
this
means
of
intercourse
i
requested
our
minister
to
france
to
attend
the
convention
as
a
delegate
i
also
designated
two
of
our
eminent
scientists
to
attend
as
our
representatives
at
the
meeting
of
an
international
committee
at
paris
for
considering
the
adoption
of
a
common
unit
to
measure
electric
force
in
view
of
the
frequent
occurrence
of
conferences
for
the
consideration
of
important
matters
of
common
interest
to
civilized
nations
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
executive
be
invested
by
congress
with
discretionary
powers
to
send
delegates
to
such
conventions
and
that
provision
be
made
to
defray
the
expenses
incident
thereto
the
difference
between
the
united
states
and
spain
as
to
the
effect
of
a
judgment
and
certificate
of
naturalization
has
not
yet
been
adjusted
but
it
is
hoped
and
believed
that
negotiations
now
in
progress
will
result
in
the
establishment
of
the
position
which
seems
to
this
government
so
reasonable
and
just
i
have
already
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
fact
that
in
the
ports
of
spain
and
its
colonies
onerous
fines
have
lately
been
imposed
upon
vessels
of
the
united
states
for
trivial
technical
offenses
against
local
regulations
efforts
for
the
abatement
of
these
exactions
have
thus
far
proved
unsuccessful
i
regret
to
inform
you
also
that
the
fees
demanded
by
spanish
consuls
in
american
ports
are
in
some
cases
so
large
when
compared
with
the
value
of
the
cargo
as
to
amount
in
effect
to
a
considerable
export
duty
and
that
our
remonstrances
in
this
regard
have
not
as
yet
received
the
attention
which
they
seem
to
deserve
the
german
government
has
invited
the
united
states
to
participate
in
an
international
exhibition
of
domestic
cattle
to
be
held
at
hamburg
in
july
if
this
country
is
to
be
represented
it
is
important
that
in
the
early
days
of
this
session
congress
should
make
a
suitable
appropriation
for
that
purpose
the
death
of
mr
marsh
our
late
minister
to
italy
has
evoked
from
that
government
expressions
of
profound
respect
for
his
exalted
character
and
for
his
honorable
career
in
the
diplomatic
service
of
his
country
the
italian
government
has
raised
a
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
recognizing
in
his
dual
capacity
the
representative
of
this
country
recently
accredited
both
as
secretary
of
legation
and
as
consulgeneral
at
rome
he
has
been
received
as
secretary
but
his
exequatur
as
consulgeneral
has
thus
far
been
withheld
the
extradition
convention
with
belgium
which
has
been
in
operation
since
has
been
lately
supplanted
by
another
the
senate
has
signified
its
approval
and
ratifications
have
been
duly
exchanged
between
the
contracting
countries
to
the
list
of
extraditable
crimes
has
been
added
that
of
the
assassination
or
attempted
assassination
of
the
chief
of
the
state
negotiations
have
been
opened
with
switzerland
looking
to
a
settlement
by
treaty
of
the
question
whether
its
citizens
can
renounce
their
allegiance
and
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
without
obtaining
the
consent
of
the
swiss
government
i
am
glad
to
inform
you
that
the
immigration
of
paupers
and
criminals
from
certain
of
the
cantons
of
switzerland
has
substantially
ceased
and
is
no
longer
sanctioned
by
the
authorities
the
consideration
of
this
subject
prompts
the
suggestion
that
the
act
of
august
which
has
for
its
object
the
return
of
foreign
convicts
to
their
own
country
should
be
so
modified
as
not
to
be
open
to
the
interpretation
that
it
affects
the
extradition
of
criminals
on
preferred
charges
of
crime
the
ottoman
porte
has
not
yet
assented
to
the
interpretation
which
this
government
has
put
upon
the
treaty
of
relative
to
its
jurisdictional
rights
in
turkey
it
may
well
be
however
that
this
difference
will
be
adjusted
by
a
general
revision
of
the
system
of
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
in
the
countries
of
the
east
a
subject
to
which
your
attention
has
been
already
called
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
the
interest
of
justice
toward
china
and
japan
i
trust
that
the
question
of
the
return
of
the
indemnity
fund
to
the
governments
of
those
countries
will
reach
at
the
present
session
the
satisfactory
solution
which
i
have
already
recommended
and
which
has
recently
been
foreshadowed
by
congressional
discussion
the
treaty
lately
concluded
with
korea
awaits
the
action
of
the
senate
during
the
late
disturbance
in
egypt
the
timely
presence
of
american
vessels
served
as
a
protection
to
the
persons
and
property
of
many
of
our
own
citizens
and
of
citizens
of
other
countries
whose
governments
have
expressed
their
thanks
for
this
assistance
the
recent
legislation
restricting
immigration
of
laborers
from
china
has
given
rise
to
the
question
whether
chinese
proceeding
to
or
from
another
country
may
lawfully
pass
through
our
own
construing
the
act
of
may
in
connection
with
the
treaty
of
november
the
restriction
would
seem
to
be
limited
to
chinese
immigrants
coming
to
the
united
states
as
laborers
and
would
not
forbid
a
mere
transit
across
our
territory
i
ask
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
for
such
action
if
any
as
may
be
deemed
advisable
this
government
has
recently
had
occasion
to
manifest
its
interest
in
the
republic
of
liberia
by
seeking
to
aid
the
amicable
settlement
of
the
boundary
dispute
now
pending
between
that
republic
and
the
british
possession
of
sierra
leone
the
reciprocity
treaty
with
hawaii
will
become
terminable
after
september
on
twelve
months
notice
by
either
party
while
certain
provisions
of
that
compact
may
have
proved
onerous
its
existence
has
fostered
commercial
relations
which
it
is
important
to
preserve
i
suggest
therefore
that
early
consideration
be
given
to
such
modifications
of
the
treaty
as
seem
to
be
demanded
by
the
interests
of
our
people
in
view
of
our
increasing
trade
with
both
hayti
and
santo
domingo
i
advise
that
provision
be
made
for
diplomatic
intercourse
with
the
latter
by
enlarging
the
scope
of
the
mission
at
port
au
prince
i
regret
that
certain
claims
of
american
citizens
against
the
government
of
hayti
have
thus
far
been
urged
unavailingly
a
recent
agreement
with
mexico
provides
for
the
crossing
of
the
frontier
by
the
armed
forces
of
either
country
in
pursuit
of
hostile
indians
in
my
message
of
last
year
i
called
attention
to
the
prevalent
lawlessness
upon
the
borders
and
to
the
necessity
of
legislation
for
its
suppression
i
again
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
a
partial
relief
from
these
mischiefs
has
been
sought
in
a
convention
which
now
awaits
the
approval
of
the
senate
as
does
also
another
touching
the
establishment
of
the
international
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
if
the
latter
is
ratified
the
action
of
congress
will
be
required
for
establishing
suitable
commissions
of
survey
the
boundary
dispute
between
mexico
and
guatemala
which
led
this
government
to
proffer
its
friendly
counsels
to
both
parties
has
been
amicably
settled
no
change
has
occurred
in
our
relations
with
venezuela
i
again
invoke
your
action
in
the
matter
of
the
pending
awards
against
that
republic
to
which
reference
was
made
by
a
special
message
from
the
executive
at
your
last
session
an
invitation
has
been
received
from
the
government
of
venezuela
to
send
representatives
in
july
to
caracas
for
participating
in
the
centennial
celebration
of
the
birth
of
bolivar
the
founder
of
south
american
independence
in
connection
with
this
event
it
is
designed
to
commence
the
erection
at
caracas
of
a
statue
of
washington
and
to
conduct
an
industrial
exhibition
which
will
be
open
to
american
products
i
recommend
that
the

united
states
be
represented
and
that
suitable
provision
be
made
therefor
the
elevation
of
the
grade
of
our
mission
in
central
america
to
the
plenipotentiary
rank
which
was
authorized
by
congress
at
its
late
session
has
been
since
effected
the
war
between
peru
and
bolivia
on
the
one
side
and
chile
on
the
other
began
more
than
three
years
ago
on
the
occupation
by
chile
in
of
all
the
littoral
territory
of
bolivia
negotiations
for
peace
were
conducted
under
the
direction
of
the
united
states
the
allies
refused
to
concede
any
territory
but
chile
has
since
become
master
of
the
whole
coast
of
both
countries
and
of
the
capital
of
peru
a
year
since
as
you
have
already
been
advised
by
correspondence
transmitted
to
you
in
january
last
this
government
sent
a
special
mission
to
the
belligerent
powers
to
express
the
hope
that
chile
would
be
disposed
to
accept
a
money
indemnity
for
the
expenses
of
the
war
and
to
relinquish
her
demand
for
a
portion
of
the
territory
of
her
antagonist
this
recommendation
which
chile
declined
to
follow
this
government
did
not
assume
to
enforce
nor
can
it
be
enforced
without
resort
to
measures
which
would
be
in
keeping
neither
with
the
temper
of
our
people
nor
with
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
the
power
of
peru
no
longer
extends
over
its
whole
territory
and
in
the
event
of
our
interference
to
dictate
peace
would
need
to
be
supplemented
by
the
armies
and
navies
of
the
united
states
such
interference
would
almost
inevitably
lead
to
the
establishment
of
a
protectoratea
result
utterly
at
odds
with
our
past
policy
injurious
to
our
present
interests
and
full
of
embarrassments
for
the
future
for
effecting
the
termination
of
hostilities
upon
terms
at
once
just
to
the
victorious
nation
and
generous
to
its
adversaries
this
government
has
spared
no
efforts
save
such
as
might
involve
the
complications
which
i
have
indicated
it
is
greatly
to
be
deplored
that
chile
seems
resolved
to
exact
such
rigorous
conditions
of
peace
and
indisposed
to
submit
to
arbitration
the
terms
of
an
amicable
settlement
no
peace
is
likely
to
be
lasting
that
is
not
sufficiently
equitable
and
just
to
command
the
approval
of
other
nations
about
a
year
since
invitations
were
extended
to
the
nations
of
this
continent
to
send
representatives
to
a
peace
congress
to
assemble
at
washington
in
november
the
time
of
meeting
was
fixed
at
a
period
then
remote
in
the
hope
as
the
invitation
itself
declared
that
in
the
meantime
the
disturbances
between
the
south
american
republics
would
be
adjusted
as
that
expectation
seemed
unlikely
to
be
realized
i
asked
in
april
last
for
an
expression
of
opinion
from
the
two
houses
of
congress
as
to
the
advisability
of
holding
the
proposed
convention
at
the
time
appointed
this
action
was
prompted
in
part
by
doubts
which
mature
reflection
had
suggested
whether
the
diplomatic
usage
and
traditions
of
the
government
did
not
make
it
fitting
that
the
executive
should
consult
the
representatives
of
the
people
before
pursuing
a
line
of
policy
somewhat
novel
in
its
character
and
far
reaching
in
its
possible
consequences
in
view
of
the
fact
that
no
action
was
taken
by
congress
in
the
premises
and
that
no
provision
had
been
made
for
necessary
expenses
i
subsequently
decided
to
postpone
the
convocation
and
so
notified
the
several
governments
which
had
been
invited
to
attend
i
am
unwilling
to
dismiss
this
subject
without
assuring
you
of
my
support
of
any
measures
the
wisdom
of
congress
may
devise
for
the
promotion
of
peace
on
this
continent
and
throughout
the
world
and
i
trust
that
the
time
is
nigh
when
with
the
universal
assent
of
civilized
peoples
all
international
differences
shall
be
determined
without
resort
to
arms
by
the
benignant
processes
of
arbitration
changes
have
occurred
in
the
diplomatic
representation
of
several
foreign
powers
during

government
and
an
embassy
from

and
a
minister
from

will
shortly
arrive
our
diplomatic
intercourse
has
been
enlarged
by
the
establishment
of
relations
with
the
new

by
the
creation
of
a
mission
to
siam
and
by
the
restoration
of

the
shah
of

has
expressed
his
gratification
that
a
charge
daffaires
will
shortly
be
sent
to
that
country
where
the
rights
of
our
citizens
have
been
hitherto
courteously
guarded
by
the
representatives
of
great
britain
i
renew
my
recommendation
of
such
legislation
as
will
place
the
united
states
in
harmony
with
other
maritime
powers
with
respect
to
the
international
rules
for
the
prevention
of
collisions
at
sea
in
conformity
with
your
joint
resolution
of
the
d
of
august
last
i
have
directed
the
secretary
of
state
to
address
foreign
governments
in
respect
to
a
proposed
conference
for
considering
the
subject
of
the
universal
adoption
of
a
common
prime
meridian
to
be
used
in
the
reckoning
of
longitude
and
in
the
regulation
of
time
throughout
the
civilized
world
their
replies
will
in
due
time
be
laid
before
you
an
agreement
was
reached
at
paris
in
between
the
principal
powers
for
the
interchange
of
official
publications
through
the
medium
of
their
respective
foreign
departments
the
admirable
system
which
has
been
built
up
by
the
enterprise
of
the
smithsonian
institution
affords
a
practical
basis
for
our
cooperation
in
this
scheme
and
an
arrangement
has
been
effected
by
which
that
institution
will
perform
the
necessary
labor
under
the
direction
of
the
department
of
state
a
reasonable
compensation
therefor
should
be
provided
by
law
a
clause
in
the
act
making
appropriations
for
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
contemplates
the
reorganization
of
both
branches
of
such
service
on
a
salaried
basis
leaving
fees
to
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
treasury
i
cordially
favor
such
a
project
as
likely
to
correct
abuses
in
the
present
system
the
secretary
of
state
will
present
to
you
at
an
early
day
a
plan
for
such
reorganization

full

house
of
representatives
of
the
united
states
an
appalling
calamity
has
befallen
the
american
people
since
their
chosen
representatives
last
met
in
the
halls
where
you
are
now
assembled
we
might
else
recall
with
unalloyed
content
the
rare
prosperity
with
which
throughout
the
year
the
nation
has
been
blessed
its
harvests
have
been
plenteous
its
varied
industries
have
thriven
the
health
of
its
people
has
been
preserved
it
has
maintained
with
foreign
governments
the
undisturbed
relations
of
amity
and
peace
for
these
manifestations
of
his
favor
we
owe
to
him
who
holds
our
destiny
in
his
hands
the
tribute
of
our
grateful
devotion
to
that
mysterious
exercise
of
his
will
which
has
taken
from
us
the
loved
and
illustrious
citizen
who
was
but
lately
the
head
of
the
nation
we
bow
in
sorrow
and
submission
the
memory
of
his
exalted
character
of
his
noble
achievements
and
of
his
patriotic
life
will
be
treasured
forever
as
a
sacred
possession
of
the
whole
people
the
announcement
of
his
death
drew
from
foreign
governments
and
peoples
tributes
of
sympathy
and
sorrow
which
history
will
record
as
signal
tokens
of
the
kinship
of
nations
and
the
federation
of
mankind
the
feeling
of
good
will
between
our
own
government
and
that
of
great
britain
was
never
more
marked
than
at
present
in
recognition
of
this
pleasing
fact
i
directed
on
the
occasion
of
the
late
centennial
celebration
at
yorktown
that
a
salute
be
given
to
the
british
flag
save
for
the
correspondence
to
which
i
shall
refer
hereafter
in
relation
to
the
proposed
canal
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
little
has
occurred
worthy
of
mention
in
the
diplomatic
relations
of
the
two
countries
early
in
the
year
the
fortune
bay
claims
were
satisfactorily
settled
by
the
british
government
paying
in
full
the
sum
of
pounds
most
of
which
has
been
already
distributed
as
the
terms
of
the
settlement
included
compensation
for
injuries
suffered
by
our
fishermen
at
aspee
bay
there
has
been
retained
from
the
gross
award
a
sum
which
is
deemed
adequate
for
those
claims
the
participation
of
americans
in
the
exhibitions
at
melbourne
and
sydney
will
be
approvingly
mentioned
in
the
reports
of
the
two
exhibitions
soon
to
be
presented
to
congress
they
will
disclose
the
readiness
of
our
countrymen
to
make
successful
competition
in
distant
fields
of
enterprise
negotiations
for
an
international
copyright
convention
are
in
hopeful
progress
the
surrender
of
sitting
bull
and
his
forces
upon
the
canadian
frontier
has
allayed
apprehension
although
bodies
of
british
indians
still
cross
the
border
in
quest
of
sustenance
upon
this
subject
a
correspondence
has
been
opened
which
promises
an
adequate
understanding
our
troops
have
orders
to
avoid
meanwhile
all
collisions
with
alien
indians
the
presence
at
the
yorktown
celebration
of
representatives
of
the
french
republic
and
descendants
of
lafayette
and
of
his
gallant
compatriots
who
were
our
allies
in
the
revolution
has
served
to
strengthen
the
spirit
of
good
will
which
has
always
existed
between
the
two
nations
you
will
be
furnished
with
the
proceedings
of
the
bimetallic
conference
held
during
the
summer
at
the
city
of
paris
no
accord
was
reached
but
a
valuable
interchange
of
views
was
had
and
the
conference
will
next
year
be
renewed
at
the
electrical
exhibition
and
congress
also
held
at
paris
this
country
was
creditably
represented
by
eminent
specialists
who
in
the
absence
of
an
appropriation
generously
lent
their
efficient
aid
at
the
instance
of
the
state
department
while
our
exhibitors
in
this
almost
distinctively
american
field
of
achievement
have
won
several
valuable
awards
i
recommend
that
congress
provide
for
the
repayment
of
the
personal
expenses
incurred
in
the
public
interest
by
the
honorary
commissioners
and
delegates
no
new
questions
respecting
the
status
of
our
naturalized
citizens
in
germany
have
arisen
during
the
year
and
the
causes
of
complaint
especially
in
alsace
and
lorraine
have
practically
ceased
through
the
liberal
action
of
the
imperial
government
in
accepting
our
oftenexpressed
views
on
the
subject
the
application
of
the
treaty
of
to
the
lately
acquired
rhenish
provinces
has
received
very
earnest
attention
and
a
definite
and
lasting
agreement
on
this
point
is
confidently
expected
the
participation
of
the
descendants
of
baron
von
steuben
in
the
yorktown
festivities
and
their
subsequent
reception
by
their
american
kinsmen
strikingly
evinced
the
ties
of
good
will
which
unite
the
german
people
and
our
own
our
intercourse
with
spain
has
been
friendly
an
agreement
concluded
in
february
last
fixes
a
term
for
the
labors
of
the
spanish
and
american
claims
commission
the
spanish
government
has
been
requested
to
pay
the
late
awards
of
that
commission
and
will
it
is
believed
accede
to
the
request
as
promptly
and
courteously
as
on
former
occasions
by
recent
legislation
onerous
fines
have
been
imposed
upon
american
shipping
in
spanish
and
colonial
ports
for
slight
irregularities
in
manifests
one
case
of
hardship
is
specially
worthy
of
attention
the
bark
masonic
bound
for
japan
entered
manila
in
distress
and
is
there
sought
to
be
confiscated
under
spanish
revenue
laws
for
an
alleged
shortage
in
her
transshipped
cargo
though
efforts
for
her
relief
have
thus
far
proved
unavailing
it
is
expected
that
the
whole
matter
will
be
adjusted
in
a
friendly
spirit
the
senate
resolutions
of
condolence
on
the
assassination
of
the
czar
alexander
ii
were
appropriately
communicated
to
the
russian
government
which
in
turn
has
expressed
its
sympathy
in
our
late
national
bereavement
it
is
desirable
that
our
cordial
relations
with
russia
should
be
strengthened
by
proper
engagements
assuring
to
peaceable
americans
who
visit
the
empire
the
consideration
which
is
due
to
them
as
citizens
of
a
friendly
state
this
is
especially
needful
with
respect
to
american
israelites
whose
classification
with
the
native
hebrews
has
evoked
energetic
remonstrances
from
this
government
a
supplementary
consular
agreement
with
italy
has
been
sanctioned
and
proclaimed
which
puts
at
rest
conflicts
of
jurisdiction
in
the
case
of
crimes
on
shipboard
several
important
international
conferences
have
been
held
in
italy
during
the
year
at
the
geographical
congress
of
venice
the
beneficence
congress
of
milan
and
the
hygienic
congress
of
turin
this
country
was
represented
by
delegates
from
branches
of
the
public
service
or
by
private
citizens
duly
accredited
in
an
honorary
capacity
it
is
hoped
that
congress
will
give
such
prominence
to
the
results
of
their
participation
as
they
may
seem
to
deserve
the
abolition
of
all
discriminating
duties
against
such
colonial
productions
of
the
dutch
east
indies
as
are
imported
hither
from
holland
has
been
already
considered
by
congress
i
trust
that
at
the
present
session
the
matter
may
be
favorably
concluded
the
insecurity
of
life
and
property
in
many
parts
of
turkey
has
given
rise
to
correspondence
with
the
porte
looking
particularly
to
the
better
protection
of
american
missionaries
in
the
empire
the
condemned
murderer
of
the
eminent
missionary
dr
justin
w
parsons
has
not
yet
been
executed
although
this
government
has
repeatedly
demanded
that
exemplary
justice
be
done
the
swiss
government
has
again
solicited
the
good
offices
of
our
diplomatic
and
consular
agents
for
the
protection
of
its
citizens
in
countries
where
it
is
not
itself
represented
this
request
has
within
proper
limits
been
granted
our
agents
in
switzerland
have
been
instructed
to
protest
against
the
conduct
of
the
authorities
of
certain
communes
in
permitting
the
emigration
to
this
country
of
criminals
and
other
objectionable
persons
several
such
persons
through
the
cooperation
of
the
commissioners
of
emigration
at
new
york
have
been
sent
back
by
the
steamers
which
brought
them
a
continuance
of
this
course
may
prove
a
more
effectual
remedy
than
diplomatic
remonstrance
treaties
of
commerce
and
navigation
and
for
the
regulation
of
consular
privileges
have
been
concluded
with
roumania
and
servia
since
their
admission
into
the
family
of
european
states
as
is
natural
with
contiguous
states
having
like
institutions
and
like
aims
of
advancement
and
development
the
friendship
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
has
been
constantly
maintained
this
government
has
lost
no
occasion
of
encouraging
the
mexican
government
to
a
beneficial
realization
of
the
mutual
advantages
which
will
result
from
more
intimate
commercial
intercourse
and
from
the
opening
of
the
rich
interior
of
mexico
to
railway
enterprise
i
deem
it
important
that
means
be
provided
to
restrain
the
lawlessness
unfortunately
so
common
on
the
frontier
and
to
suppress
the
forays
of
the
reservation
indians
on
either
side
of
the
rio
grande
the
neighboring
states
of
central
america
have
preserved
internal
peace
and
their
outward
relations
toward
us
have
been
those
of
intimate
friendship
there
are
encouraging
signs
of
their
growing
disposition
to
subordinate
their
local
interests
to
those
which
are
common
to
them
by
reason
of
their
geographical
relations
the
boundary
dispute
between
guatemala
and
mexico
has
afforded
this
government
an
opportunity
to
exercise
its
good
offices
for
preventing
a
rupture
between
those
states
and
for
procuring
a
peaceable
solution
of
the
question
i
cherish
strong
hope
that
in
view
of
our
relations
of
amity
with
both
countries
our
friendly
counsels
may
prevail
a
special
envoy
of
guatemala
has
brought
to
me
the
condolences
of
his
government
and
people
on
the
death
of
president
garfield
the
costa
rican
government
lately
framed
an
engagement
with
colombia
for
settling
by
arbitration
the
boundary
question
between
those
countries
providing
that
the
post
of
arbitrator
should
be
offered
successively
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
the
king
of
spain
and
the
president
of
the
argentine
confederation
the
king
of
the
belgians
has
declined
to
act
but
i
am
not
as
yet
advised
of
the
action
of
the
king
of
spain
as
we
have
certain
interests
in
the
disputed
territory
which
are
protected
by
our
treaty
engagements
with
one
of
the
parties
it
is
importan
t
that
the
arbitration
should
not
without
our
consent
affect
our
rights
and
this
government
has
accordingly
thought
proper
to
make
its
views
known
to
the
parties
to
the
agreement
as
well
as
to
intimate
them
to
the
belgian
and
spanish
governments
the
questions
growing
out
of
the
proposed
interoceanic
waterway
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
are
of
grave
national
importance
this
government
has
not
been
unmindful
of
the
solemn
obligations
imposed
upon
it
by
its
compact
of
with
colombia
as
the
independent
and
sovereign
mistress
of
the
territory
crossed
by
the
canal
and
has
sought
to
render
them
effective
by
fresh
engagements
with
the
colombian
republic
looking
to
their
practical
execution
the
negotiations
to
this
end
after
they
had
reached
what
appeared
to
be
a
mutually
satisfactory
solution
here
were
met
in
colombia
by
a
disavowal
of
the
powers
which
its
envoy
had
assumed
and
by
a
proposal
for
renewed
negotiation
on
a
modified
basis
meanwhile
this
government
learned
that
colombia
had
proposed
to
the
european
powers
to
join
in
a
guaranty
of
the
neutrality
of
the
proposed
panama
canala
guaranty
which
would
be
in
direct
contravention
of
our
obligation
as
the
sole
guarantor
of
the
integrity
of
colombian
territory
and
of
the
neutrality
of
the
canal
itself
my
lamented
predecessor
felt
it
his
duty
to
place
before
the
european
powers
the
reasons
which
make
the
prior
guaranty
of
the
united
states
indispensable
and
for
which
the
interjection
of
any
foreign
guaranty
might
be
regarded
as
a
superfluous
and
unfriendly
act
foreseeing
the
probable
reliance
of
the
british
government
on
the
provisions
of
the
claytonbulwer
treaty
of
as
affording
room
for
a
share
in
the
guaranties
which
the
united
states
covenanted
with
colombia
four
years
before
i
have
not
hesitated
to
supplement
the
action
of
my
predecessor
by
proposing
to
her
majestys
government
the
modification
of
that
instrument
and
the
abrogation
of
such
clauses
thereof
as
do
not
comport
with
the
obligations
of
the
united
states
toward
colombia
or
with
the
vital
needs
of
the
two
friendly
parties
to
the
compact
this
government
sees
with
great
concern
the
continuance
of
the
hostile
relations
between
chile
bolivia
and
peru
an
early
peace
between
these
republics
is
much
to
be
desired
not
only
that
they
may
themselves
be
spared
further
misery
and
bloodshed
but
because
their
continued
antagonism
threatens
consequences
which
are
in
my
judgment
dangerous
to
the
interests
of
republican
government
on
this
continent
and
calculated
to
destroy
the
best
elements
of
our
free
and
peaceful
civilization
as
in
the
present
excited
condition
of
popular
feeling
in
these
countries
there
has
been
serious
misapprehension
of
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
as
separate
diplomatic
intercourse
with
each
through
independent
ministers
is
sometimes
subject
owing
to
the
want
of
prompt
reciprocal
communication
to
temporary
misunderstanding
i
have
deemed
it
judicious
at
the
present
time
to
send
a
special
envoy
accredited
to
all
and
each
of
them
and
furnished
with
general
instructions
which
will
i
trust
enable
him
to
bring
these
powers
into
friendly
relations
the
government
of
venezuela
maintains
its
attitude
of
warm
friendship
and
continues
with
great
regularity
its
payment
of
the
monthly
quota
of
the
diplomatic
debt
without
suggesting
the
direction
in
which
congress
should
act
i
ask
its
attention
to
the
pending
questions
affecting
the
distribution
of
the
sums
thus
far
received
the
relations
between
venezuela
and
france
growing
out
of
the
same
debt
have
been
for
some
time
past
in
an
unsatisfactory
state
and
this
government
as
the
neighbor
and
one
of
the
largest
creditors
of
venezuela
has
interposed
its
influence
with
the
french
government
with
the
view
of
producing
a
friendly
and
honorable
adjustment
i
regret
that
the
commercial
interests
between
the
united
states
and
brazil
from
which
great
advantages
were
hoped
a
year
ago
have
suffered
from
the
withdrawal
of
the
american
lines
of
communication
between
the
brazilian
ports
and
our
own
through
the
efforts
of
our
minister
resident
at
buenos
ayres
and
the
united
states
minister
at
santiago
a
treaty
has
been
concluded
between
the
argentine
republic
and
chile
disposing
of
the
longpending
patagonian
boundary
question
it
is
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
our
government
has
been
afforded
the
opportunity
of
successfully
exerting
its
good
influence
for
the
prevention
of
disagreements
between
these
republics
of
the
american
continent
i
am
glad
to
inform
you
that
the
treaties
lately
negotiated
with
china
have
been
duly
ratified
on
both
sides
and
the
exchange
made
at
peking
legislation
is
necessary
to
carry
their
provisions
into
effect
the
prompt
and
friendly
spirit
with
which
the
chinese
government
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
conceded
the
modification
of
existing
treaties
should
secure
careful
regard
for
the
interests
and
susceptibilities
of
that
government
in
the
enactment
of
any
laws
relating
to
chinese
immigration
those
clauses
of
the
treaties
which
forbid
the
participation
of
citizens
or
vessels
of
the
united
states
in
the
opium
trade
will
doubtless
receive
your
approval
they
will
attest
the
sincere
interest
which
our
people
and
government
feel
in
the
commendable
efforts
of
the
chinese
government
to
put
a
stop
to
this
demoralizing
and
destructive
traffic
in
relation
both
to
china
and
japan
some
changes
are
desirable
in
our
present
system
of
consular
jurisdiction
i
hope
at
some
future
time
to
lay
before
you
a
scheme
for
its
improvement
in
the
entire
east
the
intimacy
between
our
own
country
and
japan
the
most
advanced
of
the
eastern
nations
continues
to
be
cordial
i
am
advised
that
the
emperor
contemplates
the
establishment
of
full
constitutional
government
and
that
he
has
already
summoned
a
parliamentary
congress
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
the
change
such
a
remarkable
step
toward
complete
assimilation
with
the
western
system
can
not
fail
to
bring
japan
into
closer
and
more
beneficial
relationship
with
ourselves
as
the
chief
pacific
power
a
question
has
arisen
in
relation
to
the
exercise
in
that
country
of
the
judicial
functions
conferred
upon
our
ministers
and
consuls
the
indictment
trial
and
conviction
in
the
consular
court
at
yokohama
of
john
ross
a
merchant
seaman
on
board
an
american
vessel
have
made
it
necessary
for
the
government
to
institute
a
careful
examination
into
the
nature
and
methods
of
this
jurisdiction
it
appeared
that
ross
was
regularly
shipped
under
the
flag
of
the
united
states
but
was
by
birth
a
british
subject
my
predecessor
felt
it
his
duty
to
maintain
the
position
that
during
his
service
as
a
regularly
shipped
seaman
on
board
an
american
merchant
vessel
ross
was
subject
to
the
laws
of
that
service
and
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
consular
authorities
i
renew
the
recommendation
which
has
been
heretofore
urged
by
the
executive
upon
the
attention
of
congress
that
after
the
deduction
of
such
amount
as
may
be
found
due
to
american
citizens
the
balance
of
the
indemnity
funds
heretofore
obtained
from
china
and
japan
and
which
are
now
in
the
hands
of
the
state
department
be
returned
to
the
governments
of
those
countries
the
king
of
hawaii
in
the
course
of
his
homeward
return
after
a
journey
around
the
world
has
lately
visited
this
country
while
our
relations
with
that
kingdom
are
friendly
this
government
has
viewed
with
concern
the
efforts
to
seek
replenishment
of
the
diminishing
population
of
the
islands
from
outward
sources
to
a
degree
which
may
impair
the
native
sovereignty
and
independence
in
which
the
united
states
was
among
the
first
to
testify
a
lively
interest
relations
of
unimpaired
amity
have
been
maintained
throughout
the
year
with
the
respective
governments
of
austriahungary
belgium
denmark
hayti
paraguay
and
uruguay
portugal
and
sweden
and
norway
this
may
also
be
said
of
greece
and
ecuador
although
our
relations
with
those
states
have
for
some
years
been
severed
by
the
withdrawal
of
appropriations
for
diplomatic
representatives
at
athens
and
quito
it
seems
expedient
to
restore
those
missions
even
on
a
reduced
scale
and
i
decidedly
recommend
such
a
course
with
respect
to
ecuador
which
is
likely
within
the
near
future
to
play
an
important
part
among
the
nations
of
the
southern
pacific
at
its
last
extra
session
the
senate
called
for
the
text
of
the
geneva
convention
for
the
relief
of
the
wounded
in
war
i
trust
that
this
action
foreshadows
such
interest
in
the
subject
as
will
result
in
the
adhesion
of
the
united
states
to
that
humane
and
commendable
engagement
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
propriety
of
adopting
the
new
code
of
international
rules
for
the
prevention
of
collisions
on
the
high
seas
and
of
conforming
the
domestic
legislation
of
the
united
states
thereto
so
that
no
confusion
may
arise
from
the
application
of
conflicting
rules
in
the
case
of
vessels
of
different
nationalities
meeting
in
tidal
waters
these
international
rules
differ
but
slightly
from
our
own
they
have
been
adopted
by
the
navy
department
for
the
governance
of
the
war
ships
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas
and
in
foreign
waters
and
through
the
action
of
the
state
department
in
disseminating
the
rules
and
in
acquainting
shipmasters
with
the
option
of
conforming
to
them
without
the
jurisdictional
waters
of
the
united
states
they
are
now
very
generally
known
and
obeyed
the
state
department
still
continues
to
publish
to
the
country
the
trade
and
manufacturing
reports
received
from
its
officers
abroad
the
success
of
this
course
warrants
its
continuance
and
such
appropriation
as
may
be
required
to
meet
the
rapidly
increasing
demand
for
these
publications
with
special
reference
to
the
atlanta
cotton
exposition
the
october
number
of
the
reports
was
devoted
to
a
valuable
collection
of
papers
on
the
cottongoods
trade
of
the
world
the
international
sanitary
conference
for
which
in
congress
made
provision
assembled
in
this
city
early
in
january
last
and
its
sessions
were
prolonged
until
march
although
it
reached
no
specific
conclusions
affecting
the

future
action
of
the
participant
powers
the
interchange
of
views
proved
to
be
most
valuable
the
full
protocols
of
the
sessions
have
been
already
presented
to
the
senate
as
pertinent
to
this
general
subject
i
call
your
attention
to
the
operations
of
the
national
board
of
health
established
by
act
of
congress
approved
march
its
sphere
of
duty
was
enlarged
by
the
act
of
june
in
the
same
year
by
the
lastnamed
act
the
board
was
required
to
institute
such
measures
as
might
be
deemed
necessary
for
preventing
the
introduction
of
contagious
or
infectious
diseases
from
foreign
countries
into
the
united
states
or
from
one
state
into
another
the
execution
of
the
rules
and
regulations
prepared
by
the
board
and
approved
by
my
predecessor
has
done
much
to
arrest
the
progress
of
epidemic
disease
and
has
thus
rendered
substantial
service
to
the
nation
the
international
sanitary
conference
to
which
i
have
referred
adopted
a
form
of
a
bill
of
health
to
be
used
by
all
vessels
seeking
to
enter
the
ports
of
the
countries
whose
representatives
participated
in
its
deliberations
this
form
has
since
been
prescribed
by
the
national
board
of
health
and
incorporated
with
its
rules
and
regulations
which
have
been
approved
by
me
in
pursuance
of
law
the
health
of
the
people
is
of
supreme
importance
all
measures
looking
to
their
protection
against
the
spread
of
contagious
diseases
and
to
the
increase
of
our
sanitary
knowledge
for
such
purposes
deserve
attention
of
congress
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the

in

a
highly
satisfactory

i
congratulate
you
on
the
continued
and
increasing
prosperity
of
our
country
by
the
favor
of
divine
providence
we
have
been
blessed
during
the
past
year
with
health
with
abundant
harvests
with
profitable
employment
for
all
our
people
and
with
contentment
at
home
and
with
peace
and
friendship
with
other
nations
the
occurrence
of
the
twentyfourth
election
of
chief
magistrate
has
afforded
another
opportunity
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
exhibit
to
the
world
a
significant
example
of
the
peaceful
and
safe
transmission
of
the
power
and
authority
of
government
from
the
public
servants
whose
terms
of
office
are
about
to
expire
to
their
newly
chosen
successors
this
example
can
not
fail
to
impress
profoundly
thoughtful
people
of
other
countries
with
the
advantages
which
republican
institutions
afford
the
immediate
general
and
cheerful
acquiescence
of
all
good
citizens
in
the
result
of
the
election
gives
gratifying
assurance
to
our
country
and
to
its
friends
throughout
the
world
that
a
government
based
on
the
free
consent
of
an
intelligent
and
patriotic
people
possesses
elements
of
strength
stability
and
permanency
not
found
in
any
other
form
of
government
continued
opposition
to
the
full
and
free
enjoyment
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
conferred
upon
the
colored
people
by
the
recent
amendments
to
the
constitution
still
prevails
in
several
of
the
late
slaveholding
states
it
has
perhaps
not
been
manifested
in
the
recent
election
to
any
large
extent
in
acts
of
violence
or
intimidation
it
has
however
by
fraudulent
practices
in
connection
with
the
ballots
with
the
regulations
as
to
the
places
and
manner
of
voting
and
with
counting
returning
and
canvassing
the
votes
cast
been
successful
in
defeating
the
exercise
of
the
right
preservative
of
all
rightsthe
right
of
suffragewhich
the
constitution
expressly
confers
upon
our
enfranchised
citizens
it
is
the
desire
of
the
good
people
of
the
whole
country
that
sectionalism
as
a
factor
in
our
politics
should
disappear
they
prefer
that
no
section
of
the
country
should
be
united
in
solid
opposition
to
any
other
section
the
disposition
to
refuse
a
prompt
and
hearty
obedience
to
the
equalrights
amendments
to
the
constitution
is
all
that
now
stands
in
the
way
of
a
complete
obliteration
of
sectional
lines
in
our
political
contests
as
long
as
either
of
these
amendments
is
flagrantly
violated
or
disregarded
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
the
people
who
placed
them
in
the
constitution
as
embodying
the
legitimate
results
of
the
war
for
the
union
and
who
believe
them
to
be
wise
and
necessary
will
continue
to
act
together
and
to
insist
that
they
shall
be
obeyed
the
paramount
question
still
is
as
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
fight
by
every
american
citizen
who
has
the
requisite
qualifications
to
freely
cast
his
vote
and
to
have
it
honestly
counted
with
this
question
rightly
settled
the
country
will
be
relieved
of
the
contentions
of
the
past
bygones
will
indeed
be
bygones
and
political
and
party
issues
with
respect
to
economy
and
efficiency
of
administration
internal
improvements
the
tariff
domestic
taxation
education
finance
and
other
important
subjects
will
then
receive
their
full
share
of
attention
but
resistance
to
and
nullification
of
the
results
of
the
war
will
unite
together
in
resolute
purpose
for
their
support
all
who
maintain
the
authority
of
the
government
and
the
perpetuity
of
the
union
and
who
adequately
appreciate
the
value
of
the
victory
achieved
this
determination
proceeds
from
no
hostile
sentiment
or
feeling
to
any
part
of
the
people
of
our
country
or
to
any
of
their
interests
the
inviolability
of
the
amendments
rests
upon
the
fundamental
principle
of
our
government
they
are
the
solemn
expression
of
the
will
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
sentiment
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
our
citizens
must
be
maintained
does
not
grow
weaker
it
will
continue
to
control
the
government
of
the
country
happily
the
history
of
the
late
election
shows
that
in
many
parts
of
the
country
where
opposition
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
heretofore
prevailed
it
is
diminishing
and
is
likely
to
cease
altogether
if
firm
and
wellconsidered
action
is
taken
by
congress
i
trust
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
which
have
the
right
to
judge
of
the
elections
returns
and
qualifications
of
their
own
members
will
see
to
it
that
every
case
of
violation
of
the
letter
or
spirit
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
thoroughly
investigated
and
that
no
benefit
from
such
violation
shall
accrue
to
any
person
or
party
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
executive
with
sufficient
appropriations
for
the
purpose
to
prosecute
unsparingly
all
who
have
been
engaged
in
depriving
citizens
of
the
rights
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
constitution
it
is
not
however
to
be
forgotten
that
the
best
and
surest
guaranty
of
the
primary
rights
of
citizenship
is
to
be
found
in
that
capacity
for
selfprotection
which
can
belong
only
to
a
people
whose
right
to
universal
suffrage
is
supported
by
universal
education
the
means
at
the
command
of
the
local
and
state
authorities
are
in
many
cases
wholly
inadequate
to
furnish
free
instruction
to
all
who
need
it
this
is
especially
true
where
before
emancipation
the
education
of
the
people
was
neglected
or
prevented
in
the
interest
of
slavery
firmly
convinced
that
the
subject
of
popular
education
deserves
the
earnest
attention
of
the
people
of
the
whole
country
with
a
view
to
wise
and
comprehensive
action
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
i
respectfully
recommend
that
congress
by
suitable
legislation
and
with
proper
safeguards
supplement
the
local
educational
funds
in
the
several
states
where
the
grave
duties
and
responsibilities
of
citizenship
have
been
devolved
on
uneducated
people
by
devoting
to
the
purpose
grants
of
the
public
lands
and
if
necessary
by
appropriations
from
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
whatever
government
can
fairly
do
to
promote
free
popular
education
ought
to
be
done
wherever
general
education
is
found
peace
virtue
and
social
order
prevail
and
civil
and
religious
liberty
are
secure
in
my
former
annual
messages
i
have
asked
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
urgent
necessity
of
a
reformation
of
the
civilservice
system
of
the
government
my
views
concerning
the
dangers
of
patronage
or
appointments
for
personal
or
partisan
considerations
have
been
strengthened
by
my
observation
and
experience
in
the
executive
office
and
i
believe
these
dangers
threaten
the
stability
of
the
government
abuses
so
serious
in
their
nature
can
not
be
permanently
tolerated
they
tend
to
become
more
alarming
with
the
enlargement
of
administrative
service
as
the
growth
of
the
country
in
population
increases
the
number
of
officers
and
placemen
employed
the
reasons
are
imperative
for
the
adoption
of
fixed
rules
for
the
regulation
of
appointments
promotions
and
removals
establishing
a
uniform
method
having
exclusively
in
view
in
every
instance
the
attainment
of
the
best
qualifications
for
the
position
in
question
such
a
method
alone
is
consistent
with
the
equal
rights
of
all
citizens
and
the
most
economical
and
efficient
administration
of
the
public
business
competitive
examinations
in
aid
of
impartial
appointments
and
promotions
have
been
conducted
for
some
years
past
in
several
of
the
executive
departments
and
by
my
direction
this
system
has
been
adopted
in
the
customhouses
and
postoffices
of
the
larger
cities
of
the
country
in
the
city
of
new
york
over
positions
in
the
civil
service
have
been
subject
in
their
appointments
and
tenure
of
place
to
the
operation
of
published
rules
for
this
purpose
during
the
past
two
years
the
results
of
these
practical
trials
have
been
very
satisfactory
and
have
confirmed
my
opinion
in
favor
of
this
system
of
selection
all
are
subjected
to
the
same
tests
and
the
result
is
free
from
prejudice
by
personal
favor
or
partisan
influence
it
secures
for
the
position
applied
for
the
best
qualifications
attainable
among
the
competing
applicants
it
is
an
effectual
protection
from
the
pressure
of
importunity
which
under
any
other
course
pursued
largely
exacts
the
time
and
attention
of
appointing
officers
to
their
great
detriment
in
the
discharge
of
other
official
duties
preventing
the
abuse
of
the
service
for
the
mere
furtherance
of
private
or
party
purposes
and
leaving
the
employee
of
the
government
freed
from
the
obligations
imposed
by
patronage
to
depend
solely
upon
merit
for
retention
and
advancement
and
with
this
constant
incentive
to
exertion
and
improvement
these
invaluable
results
have
been
attained
in
a
high
degree
in
the
offices
where
the
rules
for
appointment
by
competitive
examination
have
been
applied
a
method
which
has
so
approved
itself
by
experimental
tests
at
points
where
such
tests
may
be
fairly
considered
conclusive
should
be
extended
to
all
subordinate
positions
under
the
government
i
believe
that
a
strong
and
growing
public
sentiment
demands
immediate
measures
for
securing
and
enforcing
the
highest
possible
efficiency
in
the
civil
service
and
its
protection
from
recognized
abuses
and
that
the
experience
referred
to
has
demonstrated
the
feasibility
of
such
measures
the
examinations
in
the
customhouses
and
postoffices
have
been
held
under
many
embarrassments
and
without
provision
for
compensation
for
the
extra
labor
performed
by
the
officers
who
have
conducted
them
and
whose
commendable
interest
in
the
improvement
of
the
public
service
has
induced
this
devotion
of
time
and
labor
without
pecuniary
reward
a
continuance
of
these
labors
gratuitously
ought
not
to
be
expected
and
without
an
appropriation
by
congress
for
compensation
it
is
not
practicable
to
extend
the
system
of
examinations
generally
throughout
the
civil
service
it
is
also
highly
important
that
all
such
examinations
should
be
conducted
upon
a
uniform
system
and
under
general
supervision
section
of
the
revised
statutes
authorizes
the
president
to
prescribe
the
regulations
for
admission
to
the
civil
service
of
the
united
states
and
for
this
purpose
t
o
employ
suitable
persons
to
conduct
the
requisite
inquiries
with
reference
to
the
fitness
of
each
candidate
in
respect
to
age
health
character
knowledge
and
ability
for
the
branch
of
service
into
which
he
seeks
to
enter
but
the
law
is
practically
inoperative
for
want
of
the
requisite
appropriation
i
therefore
recommend
an
appropriation
of
per
annum
to
meet
the
expenses
of
a
commission
to
be
appointed
by
the
president
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
this
section
whose
duty
it
shall
be
to
devise
a
just
uniform
and
efficient
system
of
competitive
examinations
and
to
supervise
the
application
of
the
same
throughout
the
entire
civil
service
of
the
government
i
am
persuaded
that
the
facilities
which
such
a
commission
will
afford
for
testing
the
fitness
of
those
who
apply
for
office
will
not
only
be
as
welcome
a
relief
to
members
of
congress
as
it
will
be
to
the
president
and
heads
of
departments
but
that
it
will
also
greatly
tend
to
remove
the
causes
of
embarrassment
which
now
inevitably
and
constantly
attend
the
conflicting
claims
of
patronage
between
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
the
most
effectual
check
upon
the
pernicious
competition
of
influence
and
official
favoritism
in
the
bestowal
of
office
will
be
the
substitution
of
an
open
competition
of
merit
between
the
applicants
in
which
everyone
can
make
his
own
record
with
the
assurance
that
his
success
will
depend
upon
this
alone
i
also
recommend
such
legislation
as
while
leaving
every
officer
as
free
as
any
other
citizen
to
express
his
political
opinions
and
to
use
his
means
for
their
advancement
shall
also
enable
him
to
feel
as
safe
as
any
private
citizen
in
refusing
all
demands
upon
his
salary
for
political
purposes
a
law
which
should
thus
guarantee
true
liberty
and
justice
to
all
who
are
engaged
in
the
public
service
and
likewise
contain
stringent
provisions
against
the
use
of
official
authority
to
coerce
the
political
action
of
private
citizens
or
of
official
subordinates
is
greatly
to
be
desired
the
most
serious
obstacle
however
to
an
improvement
of
the
civil
service
and
especially
to
a
reform
in
the
method
of
appointment
and
removal
has
been
found
to
be
the
practice
under
what
is
known
as
the
spoils
system
by
which
the
appointing
power
has
been
so
largely
encroached
upon
by
members
of
congress
the
first
step
in
the
reform
of
the
civil
service
must
be
a
complete
divorce
between
congress
and
the
executive
in
the
matter
of
appointments
the
corrupting
doctrine
that
to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils
is
inseparable
from
congressional
patronage
as
the
established
rule
and
practice
of
parties
in
power
it
comes
to
be
understood
by
applicants
for
office
and
by
the
people
generally
that
representatives
and
senators
are
entitled
to
disburse
the
patronage
of
their
respective
districts
and
states
it
is
not
necessary
to
recite
at
length
the
evils
resulting
from
this
invasion
of
the
executive
functions
the
true
principles
of
government
on
the
subject
of
appointments
to
office
as
stated
in
the
national
conventions
of
the
leading
parties
of
the
country
have
again
and
again
been
approved
by
the
american
people
and
have
not
been
called
in
question
in
any
quarter
these
authentic
expressions
of
public
opinion
upon
this
allimportant
subject
are
the
statement
of
principles
that
belong
to
the
constitutional
structure
of
the
government
under
the
constitution
the
president
and
heads
of
departments
are
to
make
nominations
for
office
the
senate
is
to
advise
and
consent
to
appointments
and
the
house
of
representatives
is
to
accuse
and
prosecute
faithless
officers
the
best
interest
of
the
public
service
demands
that
these
distinctions
be
respected
that
senators
and
representatives
who
may
be
judges
and
accusers
should
not
dictate
appointments
to
office
to
this
end
the
cooperation
of
the
legislative
department
of
the
government
is
required
alike
by
the
necessities
of
the
case
and
by
public
opinion
members
of
congress
will
not
be
relieved
from
the
demands
made
upon
them
with
reference
to
appointments
to
office
until
by
legislative
enactment
the
pernicious
practice
is
condemned
and
forbidden
it
is
therefore
recommended
that
an
act
be
passed
defining
the
relations
of
members
of
congress
with
respect
to
appointment
to
office
by
the
president
and
i
also
recommend
that
the
provisions
of
section
and
of
the
sections
following
of
the
revised
statutes
comprising
the
tenureofoffice
act
of
march
be
repealed
believing
that
to
reform
the
system
and
methods
of
the
civil
service
in
our
country
is
one
of
the
highest
and
most
imperative
duties
of
statesmanship
and
that
it
can
be
permanently
done
only
by
the
cooperation
of
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
of
the
government
i
again
commend
the
whole
subject
to
your
considerate
attention
it
is
the
recognized
duty
and
purpose
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
suppress
polygamy
where
it
now
exists
in
our
territories
and
to
prevent
its
extension
faithful
and
zealous
efforts
have
been
made
by
the
united
states
authorities
in
utah
to
enforce
the
laws
against
it
experience
has
shown
that
the
legislation
upon
this
subject
to
be
effective
requires
extensive
modification
and
amendment
the
longer
action
is
delayed
the
more
difficult
it
will
be
to
accomplish
what
is
desired
prompt
and
decided
measures
are
necessary
the
mormon
sectarian
organization
which
upholds
polygamy
has
the
whole
power
of
making
and
executing
the
local
legislation
of
the
territory
by
its
control
of
the
grand
and
petit
juries
it
possesses
large
influence
over
the
administration
of
justice
exercising
as
the
heads
of
this
sect
do
the
local
political
power
of
the
territory
they
are
able
to
make
effective
their
hostility
to
the
law
of
congress
on
the
subject
of
polygamy
and
in
fact
do
prevent
its
enforcement
polygamy
will
not
be
abolished
if
the
enforcement
of
the
law
depends
on
those
who
practice
and
uphold
the
crime
it
can
only
be
suppressed
by
taking
away
the
political
power
of
the
sect
which
encourages
and
sustains
it
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
suitable
laws
to
protect
the
territories
is
ample
it
is
not
a
case
for
halfway
measures
the
political
power
of
the
mormon
sect
is
increasing
it
controls
now
one
of
our
wealthiest
and
most
populous
territories
it
is
extending
steadily
into
other
territories
wherever
it
goes
it
establishes
polygamy
and
sectarian
political
power
the
sanctity
of
marriage
and
the
family
relation
are
the
corner
stone
of
our
american
society
and
civilization
religious
liberty
and
the
separation
of
church
and
state
are
among
the
elementary
ideas
of
free
institutions
to
reestablish
the
interests
and
principles
which
polygamy
and
mormonism
have
imperiled
and
to
fully
reopen
to
intelligent
and
virtuous
immigrants
of
all
creeds
that
part
of
our
domain
which
has
been
in
a
great
degree
closed
to
general
immigration
by
intolerant
and
immoral
institutions
it
is
recommended
that
the
government
of
the
territory
of
utah
be
reorganized
i
recommend
that
congress
provide
for
the
government
of
utah
by
a
governor
and
judges
or
commissioners
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senatea
government
analogous
to
the
provisional
government
established
for
the
territory
northwest
of
the
ohio
by
the
ordinance
of
if
however
it
is
deemed
best
to
continue
the
existing
form
of
local
government
i
recommend
that
the
right
to
vote
hold
office
and
sit
on
juries
in
the
territory
of
utah
be
confined
to
those
who
neither
practice
nor
uphold
polygamy
if
thorough
measures
are
adopted
it
is
believed
that
within
a
few
years
the
evils
which
now
afflict
utah
will
be
eradicated
and
that
this
territory
will
in
good
time
become
one
of
the
most
prosperous
and
attractive
of
the
new
states
of
the
union
our
relations
with
all
foreign
countries
have
been
those
of
undisturbed
peace
and
have
presented
no
occasion
for
concern
as
to
their
continued
maintenance
my
anticipation
of
an
early
reply
from
the
british
government
to
the
demand
of
indemnity
to
our
fishermen
for
the
injuries
suffered
by
that
industry
at
fortune
bay
in
january
which
i
expressed
in
my
last
annual
message
was
disappointed
this
answer
was
received
only
in
the
latter
part
of
april
in
the
present
year
and
when
received
exhibited
a
failure
of
accord
between
the
two
governments
as
to
the
measure
of
the
inshore
fishing
privilege
secured
to
our
fishermen
by
the
treaty
of
washington
of
so
serious
a
character
that
i
made
it
the
subject
of
a
communication
to
congress
in
which
i
recommended
the
adoption
of
the
measures
which
seemed
to
me
proper
to
be
taken
by
this
government
in
maintenance
of
the
rights
accorded
to
our
fishermen
under
the
treaty
and
toward
securing
an
indemnity
for
the
injury
these
interests
had
suffered
a
bill
to
carry
out
these
recommendations
was
under
consideration
by
the
house
of
representatives
at
the
time
of
the
adjournment
of
congress
in
june
last
within
a
few
weeks
i
have
received
a
communication
from
her
majestys
government
renewing
the
consideration
of
the
subject
both
of
the
indemnity
for
the
injuries
at
fortune
bay
and
of
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty
in
which
the
previous
correspondence
had
shown
the
two
governments
to
be
at
variance
upon
both
these
topics
the
disposition
toward
a
friendly
agreement
is
manifested
by
a
recognition
of
our
right
to
an
indemnity
for
the
transaction
at
fortune
bay
leaving
the
measure
of
such
indemnity
to
further
conference
and
by
an
assent
to
the
view
of
this
government
presented
in
the
previous
correspondence
that
the
regulation
of
conflicting
interests
of
the
shore
fishery
of
the
provincial
seacoasts
and
the
vessel
fishery
of
our
fishermen
should
be
made
the
subject
of
conference
and
concurrent
arrangement
between
the
two
governments
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
basis
may
be
found
for
a
speedy
adjustment
of
the
very
serious
divergence
of
views
in
the
interpretation
of
the
fishery
clauses
of
the
treaty
of
washington
which
as
the
correspondence
between
the
two
governments
stood
at
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
congress
seemed
to
be
irreconcilable
in
the
important
exhibitio
n
of
arts
and
industries
which
was
held
last
year
at
sydney
new
south
wales
as
well
as
in
that
now
in
progress
at
melbourne
the
united
states
have
been
efficiently
and
honorably
represented
the
exhibitors
from
this
country
at
the
former
place
received
a
large
number
of
awards
in
some
of
the
most
considerable
departments
and
the
participation
of
the
united
states
was
recognized
by
a
special
mark
of
distinction
in
the
exhibition
at
melbourne
the
share
taken
by
our
country
is
no
less
notable
and
an
equal
degree
of
success
is
confidently
expected
the
state
of
peace
and
tranquillity
now
enjoyed
by
all
the
nations
of
the
continent
of
europe
has
its
favorable
influence
upon
our
diplomatic
and
commercial
relations
with
them
we
have
concluded
and
ratified
a
convention
with
the
french
republic
for
the
settlement
of
claims
of
the
citizens
of
either
country
against
the
other
under
this
convention
a
commission
presided
over
by
a
distinguished
publicist
appointed
in
pursuance
of
the
request
of
both
nations
by
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
brazil
has
been
organized
and
has
begun
its
sessions
in
this
city
a
congress
to
consider
means
for
the
protection
of
industrial
property
has
recently
been
in
session
in
paris
to
which
i
have
appointed
the
ministers
of
the
united
states
in
france
and
in
belgium
as
delegates
the
international
commission
upon
weights
and
measures
also
continues
its
work
in
paris
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
necessity
of
an
appropriation
to
be
made
in
time
to
enable
this
government
to
comply
with
its
obligations
under
the
metrical
convention
our
friendly
relations
with
the
german
empire
continue
without
interruption
at
the
recent
international
exhibition
of
fish
and
fisheries
at
berlin
the
participation
of
the
united
states
notwithstanding
the
haste
with
which
the
commission
was
forced
to
make
its
preparations
was
extremely
successful
and
meritorious
winning
for
private
exhibitors
numerous
awards
of
a
high
class
and
for
the
country
at
large
the
principal
prize
of
honor
offered
by
his
majesty
the
emperor
the
results
of
this
great
success
can
not
but
be
advantageous
to
this
important
and
growing
industry
there
have
been
some
questions
raised
between
the
two
governments
as
to
the
proper
effect
and
interpretation
of
our
treaties
of
naturalization
but
recent
dispatches
from
our
minister
at
berlin
show
that
favorable
progress
is
making
toward
an
understanding
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
this
government
which
makes
and
admits
no
distinction
whatever
between
the
rights
of
a
native
and
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
united
states
in
practice
the
complaints
of
molestation
suffered
by
naturalized
citizens
abroad
have
never
been
fewer
than
at
present
there
is
nothing
of
importance
to
note
in
our
unbroken
friendly
relations
with
the
governments
of
austriahungary
russia
portugal
sweden
and
norway
switzerland
turkey
and
greece
during
the
last
summer
several
vessels
belonging
to
the
merchant
marine
of
this
country
sailing
in
neutral
waters
of
the
west
indies
were
fired
at
boarded
and
searched
by
an
armed
cruiser
of
the
spanish
government
the
circumstances
as
reported
involve
not
only
a
private
injury
to
the
persons
concerned
but
also
seemed
too
little
observant
of
the
friendly
relations
existing
for
a
century
between
this
country
and
spain
the
wrong
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
spanish
government
in
a
serious
protest
and
remonstrance
and
the
matter
is
undergoing
investigation
by
the
royal
authorities
with
a
view
to
such
explanation
or
reparation
as
may
be
called
for
by
the
facts
the
commission
sitting
in
this
city
for
the
adjudication
of
claims
of
our
citizens
against
the
government
of
spain
is
i
hope
approaching
the
termination
of
its
labors
the
claims
against
the
united
states
under
the
florida
treaty
with
spain
were
submitted
to
congress
for
its
action
at
the
late
session
and
i
again
invite
your
attention
to
this
longstanding
question
with
a
view
to
a
final
disposition
of
the
matter
at
the
invitation
of
the
spanish
government
a
conference
has
recently
been
held
at
the
city
of
madrid
to
consider
the
subject
of
protection
by
foreign
powers
of
native
moors
in
the
empire
of
morocco
the
minister
of
the
united
states
in
spain
was
directed
to
take
part
in
the
deliberations
of
this
conference
the
result
of
which
is
a
convention
signed
on
behalf
of
all
the
powers
represented
the
instrument
will
be
laid
before
the
senate
for
its
consideration
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
also
lost
no
opportunity
to
urge
upon
that
of
the
emperor
of
morocco
the
necessity
in
accordance
with
the
humane
and
enlightened
spirit
of
the
age
of
putting
an
end
to
the
persecutions
which
have
been
so
prevalent
in
that
country
of
persons
of
a
faith
other
than
the
moslem
and
especially
of
the
hebrew
residents
of
morocco
the
consular
treaty
concluded
with
belgium
has
not
yet
been
officially
promulgated
owing
to
the
alteration
of
a
word
in
the
text
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
which
occasioned
a
delay
during
which
the
time
allowed
for
ratification
expired
the
senate
will
be
asked
to
extend
the
period
for
ratification
the
attempt
to
negotiate
a
treaty
of
extradition
with
denmark
failed
on
account
of
the
objection
of
the
danish
government
to
the
usual
clause
providing
that
each
nation
should
pay
the
expense
of
the
arrest
of
the
persons
whose
extradition
it
asks
the
provision
made
by
congress
at
its
last
session
for
the
expense
of
the
commission
which
had
been
appointed
to
enter
upon
negotiations
with
the
imperial
government
of
china
on
subjects
of
great
interest
to
the
relations
of
the
two
countries
enabled
the
commissioners
to
proceed
at
once
upon
their
mission
the
imperial
government
was
prepared
to
give
prompt
and
respectful
attention
to
the
matters
brought
under
negotiation
and
the
conferences
proceeded
with
such
rapidity
and
success
that
on
the
th
of
november
last
two
treaties
were
signed
at
peking
one
relating
to
the
introduction
of
chinese
into
this
country
and
one
relating
to
commerce
mr
trescot
one
of
the
commissioners
is
now
on
his
way
home
bringing
the
treaties
and
it
is
expected
that
they
will
be
received
in
season
to
be
laid
before
the
senate
early
in
january
our
minister
in
japan
has
negotiated
a
convention
for
the
reciprocal
relief
of
shipwrecked
seamen
i
take
occasion
to
urge
once
more
upon
congress
the
propriety
of
making
provision
for
the
erection
of
suitable
fireproof
buildings
at
the
japanese
capital
for
the
use
of
the
american
legation
and
the
courthouse
and
jail
connected
with
it
the
japanese
government
with
great
generosity
and
courtesy
has
offered
for
this
purpose
an
eligible
piece
of
land
in
my
last
annual
message
i
invited
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
of
the
indemnity
funds
received
some
years
ago
from
china
and
japan
i
renew
the
recommendation
then
made
that
whatever
portions
of
these
funds
are
due
to
american
citizens
should
be
promptly
paid
and
the
residue
returned
to
the
nations
respectively
to
which
they
justly
and
equitably
belong
the
extradition
treaty
with
the
kingdom
of
the
netherlands
which
has
been
for
some
time
in
course
of
negotiation
has
during
the
past
year
been
concluded
and
duly
ratified
relations
of
friendship
and
amity
have
been
established
between
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
that
of
roumania
we
have
sent
a
diplomatic
representative
to
bucharest
and
have
received
at
this
capital
the
special
envoy
who
has
been
charged
by
his
royal
highness
prince
charles
to
announce
the
independent
sovereignty
of
roumania
we
hope
for
a
speedy
development
of
commercial
relations
between
the
two
countries
in
my
last
annual
message
i
expressed
the
hope
that
the
prevalence
of
quiet
on
the
border
between
this
country
and
mexico
would
soon
become
so
assured
as
to
justify
the
modification
of
the
orders
then
in
force
to
our
military
commanders
in
regard
to
crossing
the
frontier
without
encouraging
such
disturbances
as
would
endanger
the
peace
of
the
two
countries
events
moved
in
accordance
with
these
expectations
and
the
orders
were
accordingly
withdrawn
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
our
own
citizens
and
the
mexican
government
subsequently
the
peace
of
the
border
was
again
disturbed
by
a
savage
foray
under
the
command
of
the
chief
victoria
but
by
the
combined
and
harmonious
action
of
the
military
forces
of
both
countries
his
band
has
been
broken
up
and
substantially
destroyed
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
obstacles
which
have
so
long
prevented
rapid
and
convenient
communication
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
by
railways
are
on
the
point
of
disappearing
and
that
several
important
enterprises
of
this
character
will
soon
be
set
on
foot
which
can
not
fail
to
contribute
largely
to
the
prosperity
of
both
countries
new
envoys
from
guatemala
colombia
bolivia
venezuela
and
nicaragua
have
recently
arrived
at
this
capital
whose
distinction
and
enlightenment
afford
the
best
guaranty
of
the
continuance
of
friendly
relations
between
ourselves
and
these
sister
republics
the
relations
between
this
government
and
that
of
the
united
states
of
colombia
have
engaged
public
attention
during
the
past
year
mainly
by
reason
of
the
project
of
an
interoceanic
canal
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
to
be
built
by
private
capital
under
a
concession
from
the
colombian
government
for
that
purpose
the
treaty
obligations
subsisting
between
the
united
states
and
colombia
by
which
we
guarantee
the
neutrality
of
the
transit
and
the
sovereignty
and
property
of
colombia
in
the
isthmus
make
it
necessary
that
the
conditions
under
which
so
stupendous
a
change
in
the
region
embraced
in
this
guaranty
should
be
effectedtransforming
as
it
would
this
isthmus
from
a
barrier
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
into
a
gateway
and
thoroughfare
between
them
for
the
navies
and
the
merchant
ships
of
the
worldshould
receive
the
approval
of
this
government
as
being
compatible
with
the
discharge
of
these
obligations
on
our
part
and
consistent
with
our
interests
as
the
principal
commercial
power
of
the
western
hemisphere
the
views
which
i
exp
ressed
in
a
special
message
to
congress
in
march
last
in
relation
to
this
project
i
deem
it
my
duty
again
to
press
upon
your
attention
subsequent
consideration
has
but
confirmed
the
opinion
that
it
is
the
right
and
duty
of
the
united
states
to
assert
and
maintain
such
supervision
and
authority
over
any
interoceanic
canal
across
the
isthmus
that
connects
north
and
south
america
as
will
protect
our
national
interest
the
war
between
the
republic
of
chile
on
the
one
hand
and
the
allied
republics
of
peru
and
bolivia
on
the
other
still
continues
this
government
has
not
felt
called
upon
to
interfere
in
a
contest
that
is
within
the
belligerent
rights
of
the
parties
as
independent
states
we
have
however
always
held
ourselves
in
readiness
to
aid
in
accommodating
their
difference
and
have
at
different
times
reminded
both
belligerents
of
our
willingness
to
render
such
service
our
good
offices
in
this
direction
were
recently
accepted
by
all
the
belligerents
and
it
was
hoped
they
would
prove
efficacious
but
i
regret
to
announce
that
the
measures
which
the
ministers
of
the
united
states
at
santiago
and
lima
were
authorized
to
take
with
the
view
to
bring
about
a
peace
were
not
successful
in
the
course
of
the
war
some
questions
have
arisen
affecting
neutral
rights
in
all
of
these
the
ministers
of
the
united
states
have
under
their
instructions
acted
with
promptness
and
energy
in
protection
of
american
interests
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
the
empire
of
brazil
continue
to
be
most
cordial
and
their
commercial
intercourse
steadily
increases
to
their
mutual
advantage
the
internal
disorders
with
which
the
argentine
republic
has
for
some
time
past
been
afflicted
and
which
have
more
or
less
influenced
its
external
trade
are
understood
to
have
been
brought
to
a
close
this
happy
result
may
be
expected
to
redound
to
the
benefit
of
the
foreign
commerce
of
that
republic
as
well
as
to
the
development
of
its
vast
interior
resources
in
samoa
the
government
of
king
malietoa
under
the
support
and
recognition
of
the
consular
representatives
of
the
united
states
great
britain
and
germany
seems
to
have
given
peace
and
tranquillity
to
the
islands
while
it
does
not
appear
desirable
to
adopt
as
a
whole
the
scheme
of
tripartite
local
government
which
has
been
proposed
the
common
interests
of
the
three
great
treaty
powers
require
harmony
in
their
relations
to
the
native
frame
of
government
and
this
may
be
best
secured
by
a
simple
diplomatic
agreement
between
them
it
would
be
well
if
the
consular
jurisdiction
of
our
representative
at
apia
were
increased
in
extent
and
importance
so
as
to
guard
american
interests
in
the
surrounding
and
outlying
islands
of
oceanica
the
obelisk
generously
presented
by
the
khedive
of
egypt
to
the
city
of
new
york
has
safely
arrived
in
this
country
and
will
soon
be
erected
in
that
metropolis
a
commission
for
the
liquidation
of
the
egyptian
debt
has
lately
concluded
its
work
and
this
government
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
the
khedive
has
acceded
to
the
provisions
adopted
by
it
which
will
be
laid
before
congress
for
its
information
a
commission
for
the
revision
of
the
judicial
code
of
the
reform
tribunal
of
egypt
is
now
in
session
in
cairo
mr
farman
consulgeneral
and
j
m
batchelder
esq
have
been
appointed
as
commissioners
to
participate
in
this
work
the
organization
of
the
reform
tribunals
will
probably
be
continued
for
another
period
of
five
years
in
pursuance
of
the
act
passed
at
the
last
session
of
congress
invitations
have
been
extended
to
foreign
maritime
states
to
join
in
a
sanitary
conference
in
washington
beginning
the
st
of
january
the
acceptance
of
this
invitation
by
many
prominent
powers
gives
promise
of
success
in
this
important
measure
designed
to
establish
a
system
of
international
notification
by
which
the
spread
of
infectious
or
epidemic
diseases
may
be
more
effectively
checked
or
prevented
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
to
the
necessary
appropriations
for
carrying
into
effect
the
provisions
of
the
act
referred
to
the
efforts
of
the
department
of
state
to
enlarge
the
trade
and
commerce
of
the
united
states
through
the
active
agency
of
consular
officers
and
through
the
dissemination
of
information
obtained
from
them
have
been
unrelaxed
the
interest
in
these
efforts
as
developed
in
our
commercial
communities
and
the
value
of
the
information
secured
by
this
means
to
the
trade
and
manufactures
of
the
country
were
recognized
by
congress
at
its
last
session
and
provision
was
made
for
the
more
frequent
publication
of
consular
and
other
reports
by
the
department
of
state
the
first
issue
of
this
publication
has
now
been
prepared
and
subsequent
issues
may
regularly
be
expected
the
importance
and
interest
attached
to
the
reports
of
consular
officers
are
witnessed
by
the
general
demand
for
them
by
all
classes
of
merchants
and
manufacturers
engaged
in
our
foreign
trade
it
is
believed
that
the
system
of
such
publications
is
deserving
of
the
approval
of
congress
and
that
the
necessary
appropriations
for
its
continuance
and
enlargement
will
commend
itself
to
your
consideration
the
prosperous
energies
of
our
domestic
industries
and
their
immense
production
of
the
subjects
of
foreign
commerce
invite
and
even
require
an
active
development
of
the
wishes
and
interests
of
our
people
in
that
direction
especially
important
is
it
that
our
commercial
relations
with
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
of
south
america
with
the
west
indies
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
should
be
direct
and
not
through
the
circuit
of
european
systems
and
should
be
carried
on
in
our
own
bottoms
the
full
appreciation
of
the
opportunities
which
our
front
on
the
pacific
ocean
gives
to
commerce
with
japan
china
and
the
east
indies
with
australia
and
the
island
groups
which
lie
along
these
routes
of
navigation
should
inspire
equal
efforts
to
appropriate
to
our
own
shipping
and
to
administer
by
our
own
capital
a
due
proportion
of
this
trade
whatever
modifications
of
our
regulations
of
trade
and
navigation
may
be
necessary
or
useful
to
meet
and
direct
these
impulses
to
the
enlargement
of
our
exchanges
and
of
our
carrying
trade
i
am
sure
the
wisdom
of
congress
will
be
ready
to
supply
one
initial
measure
however
seems
to
me
so
dearly
useful
and
efficient
that
i
venture
to
press
it
upon
your
earnest
attention
it
seems
to
be
very
evident
that
the
provision
of
regular
steam
postal
communication
by
aid
from
government
has
been
the
forerunner
of
the
commercial
predominance
of
great
britain
on
all
these
coasts
and
seas
a
greater
share
in
whose
trade
is
now
the
desire
and
the
intent
of
our
people
it
is
also
manifest
that
the
efforts
of
other
european
nations
to
contend
with
great
britain
for
a
share
of
this
commerce
have
been
successful
in
proportion
with
their
adoption
of
regular
steam
postal
communication
with
the
markets
whose
trade
they
sought
mexico
and
the
states
of
south
america
are
anxious
to
receive
such
postal
communication
with
this
country
and
to
aid
in
their
development
similar
cooperation
may
be
looked
for
in
due
time
from
the
eastern
nations
and
from
australia
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
lead
in
this
movement
can
be
expected
from
private
interests
in
respect
of
foreign
commerce
quite
as
much
as
in
internal
trade
postal
communication
seems
necessarily
a
matter
of
common
and
public
administration
and
thus
pertaining
to
government
i
respectfully
recommend
to
your
prompt
attention
such
just
and
efficient
measures
as
may
conduce
to
the
development
of
our
foreign
commercial
exchanges
and
the
building
up
of
our
carrying
trade
in
this
connection
i
desire
also
to
suggest
the
very
great
service
which
might
be
expected
in
enlarging
and
facilitating
our
commerce
on
the
pacific
ocean
were
a
transmarine
cable
laid
from
san
francisco
to
the
sandwich
islands
and
thence
to
japan
at
the
north
and
australia
at
the
south
the
great
influence
of
such
means
of
communication
on
these
routes
of
navigation
in
developing
and
securing
the
due
share
of
our
pacific
coast
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
needs
no
illustration
or
enforcement
it
may
be
that
such
an
enterprise
useful
and
in
the
end
profitable
as
it
would
prove
to
private
investment
may
need
to
be
accelerated
by
prudent
legislation
by
congress
in
its
aid
and
i
submit
the
matter
to
your
careful
consideration
an
additional
and
not
unimportant
although
secondary
reason
for
fostering
and
enlarging
the
navy
may
be
found
in
the
unquestionable
service
to
the
expansion
of
our
commerce
which
would
be
rendered
by
the
frequent
circulation
of
naval
ships
in
the
seas
and
ports
of
all
quarters
of
the
globe
ships
of
the
proper
construction
and
equipment
to
be
of
the
greatest
efficiency
in
case
of
maritime
war
might
be
made
constant
and
active
agents
in
time
of
peace
in
the
advancement
and
protection
of
our
foreign
trade
and
in
the
nurture
and
discipline
of
young
seamen
who
would
naturally
in
some
numbers
mix
with
and
improve
the
crews
of
our
merchant
ships
our
merchants
at
home
and
abroad
recognize
the
value
to
foreign
commerce
of
an
active
movement
of
our
naval
vessels
and
the
intelligence
and
patriotic
zeal
of
our
naval
officers
in
promoting
every
interest
of
their
countrymen
is
a
just
subject
of
national
pride
the
condition
of
the
financial
affairs
of
the
government
as
shown
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
very
satisfactory
it
is
believed
that
the
present
financial
situation
of
the
united
states
whether
considered
with
respect
to
trade
currency
credit
growing
wealth
or
the
extent
and
variety
of
our
resources
is
more
favorable
than
that
of
any
other
country
of
our
time
and
has
never
been
surpassed
by
that
of
any
country
at
any
period
of
its
history
all
our
industries
are
thriving
the
rate
of

increasing

in

under
circumstances
calling
for
mutual
congratulation
and
grateful
acknowledgment
to
the
giver
of
all
good
for
the
large
and
unusual
measure
of
national
prosperity
which
we
now
enjoy
the
most
interesting
events
which
have
occurred
in
our
public
affairs
since
my
last
annual
message
to
congress
are
connected
with
the
financial
operations
of
the
government
directly
affecting
the
business
interests
of
the
country
i
congratulate
congress
on
the
successful
execution
of
the
resumption
act
at
the
time
fixed
and
in
the
manner
contemplated
by
law
united
states
notes
began
to
be
redeemed
in
coin
since
the
st
of
january
last
they
have
been
promptly
redeemed
on
presentation
and
in
all
business
transactions
public
and
private
in
all
parts
of
the
country
they
are
received
and
paid
out
as
the
equivalent
of
coin
the
demand
upon
the
treasury
for
gold
and
silver
in
exchange
for
united
states
notes
has
been
comparatively
small
and
the
voluntary
deposit
of
coin
and
bullion
in
exchange
for
notes
has
been
very
large
the
excess
of
the
precious
metals
deposited
or
exchanged
for
united
states
notes
over
the
amount
of
united
states
notes
redeemed
is
about
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
has
been
followed
by
a
very
great
revival
of
business
with
a
currency
equivalent
in
value
to
the
money
of
the
commercial
world
we
are
enabled
to
enter
upon
an
equal
competition
with
other
nations
in
trade
and
production
the
increasing
foreign
demand
for
our
manufactures
and
agricultural
products
has
caused
a
large
balance
of
trade
in
our
favor
which
has
been
paid
in
gold
from
the
st
of
july
last
to
november
to
the
amount
of
about
since
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
there
has
also
been
a
marked
and
gratifying
improvement
of
the
public
credit
the
bonds
of
the
government
bearing
only
per
cent
interest
have
been
sold
at
or
above
par
sufficient
in
amount
to
pay
off
all
of
the
national
debt
which
was
redeemable
under
present
laws
the
amount
of
interest
saved
annually
by
the
process
of
refunding
the
debt
since
march
is
the
bonds
sold
were
largely
in
small
sums
and
the
number
of
our
citizens
now
holding
the
public
securities
is
much
greater
than
ever
before
the
amount
of
the
national
debt
which
matures
within
less
than
two
years
is
of
which
bear
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
and
the
balance
is
in
bonds
bearing
per
cent
interest
it
is
believed
that
this
part
of
the
public
debt
can
be
refunded
by
the
issue
of
per
cent
bonds
and
by
the
reduction
of
interest
which
will
thus
be
effected
about
can
be
annually
saved
to
the
treasury
to
secure
this
important
reduction
of
interest
to
be
paid
by
the
united
states
further
legislation
is
required
which
it
is
hoped
will
be
provided
by
congress
during
its
present
session
the
coinage
of
gold
by
the
mints
of
the
united
states
during
the
last
fiscal
year
was
the
coinage
of
silver
dollars
since
the
passage
of
the
act
for
that
purpose
up
to
november
was
of
which
have
been
issued
from
the
treasury
and
are
now
in
circulation
and
are
still
in
the
possession
of
the
government
the
pendency
of
the
proposition
for
unity
of
action
between
the
united
states
and
the
principal
commercial
nations
of
europe
to
effect
a
permanent
system
for
the
equality
of
gold
and
silver
in
the
recognized
money
of
the
world
leads
me
to
recommend
that
congress
refrain
from
new
legislation
on
the
general
subject
the
great
revival
of
trade
internal
and
foreign
will
supply
during
the
coming
year
its
own
instructions
which
may
well
be
awaited
before
attempting
further
experimental
measures
with
the
coinage
i
would
however
strongly
urge
upon
congress
the
importance
of
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
suspend
the
coinage
of
silver
dollars
upon
the
present
legal
ratio
the
market
value
of
the
silver
dollar
being
uniformly
and
largely
less
than
the
market
value
of
the
gold
dollar
it
is
obviously
impracticable
to
maintain
them
at
par
with
each
other
if
both
are
coined
without
limit
if
the
cheaper
coin
is
forced
into
circulation
it
will
if
coined
without
limit
soon
become
the
sole
standard
of
value
and
thus
defeat
the
desired
object
which
is
a
currency
of
both
gold
and
silver
which
shall
be
of
equivalent
value
dollar
for
dollar
with
the
universally
recognized
money
of
the
world
the
retirement
from
circulation
of
united
states
notes
with
the
capacity
of
legal
tender
in
private
contracts
is
a
step
to
be
taken
in
our
progress
toward
a
safe
and
stable
currency
which
should
be
accepted
as
the
policy
and
duty
of
the
government
and
the
interest
and
security
of
the
people
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
the
issue
of
legaltender
paper
money
based
wholly
upon
the
authority
and
credit
of
the
government
except
in
extreme
emergency
is
without
warrant
in
the
constitution
and
a
violation
of
sound
financial
principles
the
issue
of
united
states
notes
during
the
late
civil
war
with
the
capacity
of
legal
tender
between
private
individuals
was
not
authorized
except
as
a
means
of
rescuing
the
country
from
imminent
peril
the
circulation
of
these
notes
as
paper
money
for
any
protracted
period
of
time
after
the
accomplishment
of
this
purpose
was
not
contemplated
by
the
framers
of
the
law
under
which
they
were
issued
they
anticipated
the
redemption
and
withdrawal
of
these
notes
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
consistent
with
the
attainment
of
the
object
for
which
they
were
provided
the
policy
of
the
united
states
steadily
adhered
to
from
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
has
been
to
avoid
the
creation
of
a
national
debt
and
when
from
necessity
in
time
of
war
debts
have
been
created
they
have
been
paid
off
on
the
return
of
peace
as
rapidly
as
possible
with
this
view
and
for
this
purpose
it
is
recommended
that
the
existing
laws
for
the
accumulation
of
a
sinking
fund
sufficient
to
extinguish
the
public
debt
within
a
limited
period
be
maintained
if
any
change
of
the
objects
or
rates
of
taxation
is
deemed
necessary
by
congress
it
is
suggested
that
experience
has
shown
that
a
duty
can
be
placed
on
tea
and
coffee
which
will
not
enhance
the
price
of
those
articles
to
the
consumer
and
which
will
add
several
millions
of
dollars
annually
to
the
treasury
the
continued
deliberate
violation
by
a
large
number
of
the
prominent
and
influential
citizens
of
the
territory
of
utah
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
for
the
prosecution
and
punishment
of
polygamy
demands
the
attention
of
every
department
of
the
government
this
territory
has
a
population
sufficient
to
entitle
it
to
admission
as
a
state
and
the
general
interests
of
the
nation
as
well
as
the
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
the
territory
require
its
advance
from
the
territorial
form
of
government
to
the
responsibilities
and
privileges
of
a
state
this
important
change
will
not
however
be
approved
by
the
country
while
the
citizens
of
utah
in
very
considerable
number
uphold
a
practice
which
is
condemned
as
a
crime
by
the
laws
of
all
civilized
communities
throughout
the
world
the
law
for
the
suppression
of
this
offense
was
enacted
with
great
unanimity
by
congress
more
than
seventeen
years
ago
but
has
remained
until
recently
a
dead
letter
in
the
territory
of
utah
because
of
the
peculiar
difficulties
attending
its
enforcement
the
opinion
widely
prevailed
among
the
citizens
of
utah
that
the
law
was
in
contravention
of
the
constitutional
guaranty
of
religious
freedom
this
objection
is
now
removed
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
decided
the
law
to
be
within
the
legislative
power
of
congress
and
binding
as
a
rule
of
action
for
all
who
reside
within
the
territories
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
for
delay
or
hesitation
in
its
enforcement
it
should
be
firmly
and
effectively
executed
if
not
sufficiently
stringent
in
its
provisions
it
should
be
amended
and
in
aid
of
the
purpose
in
view
i
recommend
that
more
comprehensive
and
more
searching
methods
for
preventing
as
well
as
punishing
this
crime
be
provided
if
necessary
to
secure
obedience
to
the
law
the
enjoyment
and
exercise
of
the
rights
and
privileges
of
citizenship
in
the
territories
of
the
united
states
may
be
withheld
or
withdrawn
from
those
who
violate
or
oppose
the
enforcement
of
the
law
on
this
subject
the
elections
of
the
past
year
though
occupied
only
with
state
officers
have
not
failed
to
elicit
in
the
political
discussions
which
attended
them
all
over
the
country
new
and
decisive
evidence
of
the
deep
interest
which
the
great
body
of
citizens
take
in
the
progress
of
the
country
toward
a
more
general
and
complete
establishment
at
whatever
cost
of
universal
security
and
freedom
in
the
exercise
of
the
elective
franchise
while
many
topics
of
political
concern
demand
great
attention
from
our
people
both
in
the
sphere
of
national
and
state
authority
i
find
no
reason
to
qualify
the
opinion
i
expressed
in
my
last
annual
message
that
no
temporary
or
administrative
interests
of
government
however
urgent
or
weighty
will
ever
displace
the
zeal
of
our
people
in
defense
of
the
primary
rights
of
citizenship
and
that
the
power
of
public
opinion
will
override
all
political
prejudices
and
all
sectional
and
state
attachments
in
demanding
that
all
over
our
wide
territory
the
name
and
character
of
citizen
of
the
united
states
shall
mean
one
and
the
same
thing
and
carry
with
them
unchallenged
security
and
respect
i
earnestly
appeal
to
the
intelligence
and
patriotism
of
all
good
citizens
of
every
part
of
the
country
however
much
they
maybe
divided
in
opinions
on
other
political
subjects
to
unite
in
compelling
obedience
to
existing
laws
aimed
at
the
protection
of
the
right
of
suffrage
i
respectfully
urge
upon
congress
to
supply
any
defects
in
these
laws
which
experience
has
shown
and
which
it
is
within
its
power
to
remedy
i
again
invoke
the
cooperation
of
the
executive
and
legislative
authorities
of
the
states
in
this
great
purpose
i
am
fully
convinced
that
if
the
public
mind
can
be
set
at
rest
on
this
paramount
question
of
popular
rights
no
serious
obstacle
will
thw
art
or
delay
the
complete
pacification
of
the
country
or
retard
the
general
diffusion
of
prosperity
in
a
former
message
i
invited
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
subject
of
the
reformation
of
the
civil
service
of
the
government
and
expressed
the
intention
of
transmitting
to
congress
as
early
as
practicable
a
report
upon
this
subject
by
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission
in
view
of
the
facts
that
during
a
considerable
period
the
government
of
great
britain
has
been
dealing
with
administrative
problems
and
abuses
in
various
particulars
analogous
to
those
presented
in
this
country
and
that
in
recent
years
the
measures
adopted
were
understood
to
have
been
effective
and
in
every
respect
highly
satisfactory
i
thought
it
desirable
to
have
fuller
information
upon
the
subject
and
accordingly
requested
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
for
this
purpose
the
result
has
been
an
elaborate
and
comprehensive
report
the
report
sets
forth
the
history
of
the
partisan
spoils
system
in
great
britain
and
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
parliamentary
patronage
and
of
official
interference
with
the
freedom
of
elections
it
shows
that
after
long
trials
of
various
kinds
of
examinations
those
which
are
competitive
and
open
on
equal
terms
to
all
and
which
are
carried
on
under
the
superintendence
of
a
single
commission
have
with
great
advantage
been
established
as
conditions
of
admission
to
almost
every
official
place
in
the
subordinate
administration
of
that
country
and
of
british
india
the
completion
of
the
report
owing
to
the
extent
of
the
labor
involved
in
its
preparation
and
the
omission
of
congress
to
make
any
provision
either
for
the
compensation
or
the
expenses
of
the
commission
has
been
postponed
until
the
present
time
it
is
herewith
transmitted
to
congress
while
the
reform
measures
of
another
government
are
of
no
authority
for
us
they
are
entitled
to
influence
to
the
extent
to
which
their
intrinsic
wisdom
and
their
adaptation
to
our
institutions
and
social
life
may
commend
them
to
our
consideration
the
views
i
have
heretofore
expressed
concerning
the
defects
and
abuses
in
our
civil
administration
remain
unchanged
except
in
so
far
as
an
enlarged
experience
has
deepened
my
sense
of
the
duty
both
of
officers
and
of
the
people
themselves
to
cooperate
for
their
removal
the
grave
evils
and
perils
of
a
partisan
spoils
system
of
appointment
to
office
and
of
office
tenure
are
now
generally
recognized
in
the
resolutions
of
the
great
parties
in
the
reports
of
departments
in
the
debates
and
proceedings
of
congress
in
the
messages
of
executives
the
gravity
of
these
evils
has
been
pointed
out
and
the
need
of
their
reform
has
been
admitted
to
command
the
necessary
support
every
measure
of
reform
must
be
based
on
common
right
and
justice
and
must
be
compatible
with
the
healthy
existence
of
great
parties
which
are
inevitable
and
essential
in
a
free
state
when
the
people
have
approved
a
policy
at
a
national
election
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
officers
they
have
selected
and
of
the
advisers
who
in
accordance
with
our
political
institutions
should
be
consulted
in
the
policy
which
it
is
their
duty
to
carry
into
effect
is
indispensable
it
is
eminently
proper
that
they
should
explain
it
before
the
people
as
well
as
illustrate
its
spirit
in
the
performance
of
their
official
duties
very
different
considerations
apply
to
the
greater
number
of
those
who
fill
the
subordinate
places
in
the
civil
service
their
responsibility
is
to
their
superiors
in
official
position
it
is
their
duty
to
obey
the
legal
instructions
of
those
upon
whom
that
authority
is
devolved
and
their
best
public
service
consists
in
the
discharge
of
their
functions
irrespective
of
partisan
politics
their
duties
are
the
same
whatever
party
is
in
power
and
whatever
policy
prevails
as
a
consequence
it
follows
that
their
tenure
of
office
should
not
depend
on
the
prevalence
of
any
policy
or
the
supremacy
of
any
party
but
should
be
determined
by
their
capacity
to
serve
the
people
most
usefully
quite
irrespective
of
partisan
interests
the
same
considerations
that
should
govern
the
tenure
should
also
prevail
in
the
appointment
discipline
and
removal
of
these
subordinates
the
authority
of
appointment
and
removal
is
not
a
perquisite
which
may
be
used
to
aid
a
friend
or
reward
a
partisan
but
is
a
trust
to
be
exercised
in
the
public
interest
under
all
the
sanctions
which
attend
the
obligation
to
apply
the
public
funds
only
for
public
purposes
every
citizen
has
an
equal
right
to
the
honor
and
profit
of
entering
the
public
service
of
his
country
the
only
just
ground
of
discrimination
is
the
measure
of
character
and
capacity
he
has
to
make
that
service
most
useful
to
the
people
except
in
cases
where
upon
just
and
recognized
principlesas
upon
the
theory
of
pensionsoffices
and
promotions
are
bestowed
as
rewards
for
past
services
their
bestowal
upon
any
theory
which
disregards
personal
merit
is
an
act
of
injustice
to
the
citizen
as
well
as
a
breach
of
that
trust
subject
to
which
the
appointing
power
is
held
in
the
light
of
these
principles
it
becomes
of
great
importance
to
provide
just
and
adequate
means
especially
for
every
department
and
large
administrative
office
where
personal
discrimination
on
the
part
of
its
head
is
not
practicable
for
ascertaining
those
qualifications
to
which
appointments
and
removals
should
have
reference
to
fail
to
provide
such
means
is
not
only
to
deny
the
opportunity
of
ascertaining
the
facts
upon
which
the
most
righteous
claim
to
office
depends
but
of
necessity
to
discourage
all
worthy
aspirants
by
handing
over
appointments
and
removals
to
mere
influence
and
favoritism
if
it
is
the
right
of
the
worthiest
claimant
to
gain
the
appointment
and
the
interest
of
the
people
to
bestow
it
upon
him
it
would
seem
clear
that
a
wise
and
just
method
of
ascertaining
personal
fitness
for
office
must
be
an
important
and
permanent
function
of
every
just
and
wise
government
it
has
long
since
become
impossible
in
the
great
offices
for
those
having
the
duty
of
nomination
and
appointment
to
personally
examine
into
the
individual
qualifications
of
more
than
a
small
proportion
of
those
seeking
office
and
with
the
enlargement
of
the
civil
service
that
proportion
must
continue
to
become
less
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
government
the
subordinate
offices
were
so
few
in
number
that
it
was
quite
easy
for
those
making
appointments
and
promotions
to
personally
ascertain
the
merits
of
candidates
party
managers
and
methods
had
not
then
become
powerful
agencies
of
coercion
hostile
to
the
free
and
just
exercise
of
the
appointing
power
a
large
and
responsible
part
of
the
duty
of
restoring
the
civil
service
to
the
desired
purity
and
efficiency
rests
upon
the
president
and
it
is
my
purpose
to
do
what
is
within
my
power
to
advance
such
prudent
and
gradual
measures
of
reform
as
will
most
surely
and
rapidly
bring
about
that
radical
change
of
system
essential
to
make
our
administrative
methods
satisfactory
to
a
free
and
intelligent
people
by
a
proper
exercise
of
authority
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
executive
to
do
much
to
promote
such
a
reform
but
it
can
not
be
too
clearly
understood
that
nothing
adequate
can
be
accomplished
without
cooperation
on
the
part
of
congress
and
considerate
and
intelligent
support
among
the
people
reforms
which
challenge
the
generally
accepted
theories
of
parties
and
demand
changes
in
the
methods
of
departments
are
not
the
work
of
a
day
their
permanent
foundations
must
be
laid
in
sound
principles
and
in
an
experience
which
demonstrates
their
wisdom
and
exposes
the
errors
of
their
adversaries
every
worthy
officer
desires
to
make
his
official
action
a
gain
and
an
honor
to
his
country
but
the
people
themselves
far
more
than
their
officers
in
public
station
are
interested
in
a
pure
economical
and
vigorous
administration
by
laws
enacted
in
and
and
now
in
substance
incorporated
in
the
revised
statutes
the
practice
of
arbitrary
appointments
to
the
several
subordinate
grades
in
the
great
departments
was
condemned
and
examinations
as
to
capacity
to
be
conducted
by
departmental
boards
of
examiners
were
provided
for
and
made
conditions
of
admission
to
the
public
service
these
statutes
are
a
decision
by
congress
that
examinations
of
some
sort
as
to
attainments
and
capacity
are
essential
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
public
service
the
important
questions
since
the
enactment
of
these
laws
have
been
as
to
the
character
of
these
examinations
and
whether
official
favor
and
partisan
influence
or
common
right
and
merit
were
to
control
the
access
to
the
examinations
in
practice
these
examinations
have
not
always
been
open
to
worthy
persons
generally
who
might
wish
to
be
examined
official
favoritism
and
partisan
influence
as
a
rule
appear
to
have
designated
those
who
alone
were
permitted
to
go
before
the
examining
boards
subjecting
even
the
examiners
to
a
pressure
from
the
friends
of
the
candidates
very
difficult
to
resist
as
a
consequence
the
standard
of
admission
fell
below
that
which
the
public
interest
demanded
it
was
also
almost
inevitable
that
a
system
which
provided
for
various
separate
boards
of
examiners
with
no
common
supervision
or
uniform
method
of
procedure
should
result
in
confusion
inconsistency
and
inadequate
tests
of
capacity
highly
detrimental
to
the
public
interest
a
further
and
more
radical
change
was
obviously
required
in
the
annual
message
of
december
my
predecessor
declared
that
there
is
no
duty
which
so
much
embarrasses
the
executive
and
heads
of
departments
as
that
of
appointments
nor
is
there
any
such
arduous
and
thankless
labor
imposed
on
senators
and
representatives
as
that
of
finding
places
for
constituents
the
present
system
does
not
secure
the
best
men
and
often
not
even
fit
men
for
public
place
the
elevation
and
purification
of
the
civil
service
of
the
government
will
be
hailed
with
approval
by
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
congress
accordingly
passed
the
act
approved
march
to
regulate
the
civil
service
of
the
united
states
a
nd
promote
the
efficiency
thereof
giving
the
necessary
authority
to
the
executive
to
inaugurate
a
civilservice
reform
acting
under
this
statute
which
was
interpreted
as
intended
to
secure
a
system
of
just
and
effectual
examinations
under
uniform
supervision
a
number
of
eminently
competent
persons
were
selected
for
the
purpose
who
entered
with
zeal
upon
the
discharge
of
their
duties
prepared
with
an
intelligent
appreciation
of
the
requirements
of
the
service
the
regulations
contemplated
and
took
charge
of
the
examinations
and
who
in
their
capacity
as
a
board
have
been
known
as
the
civil
service
commission
congress
for
two
years
appropriated
the
money
needed
for
the
compensation
and
for
the
expense
of
carrying
on
the
work
of
the
commission
it
appears
from
the
report
of
the
commission
submitted
to
the
president
in
april
that
examinations
had
been
held
in
various
sections
of
the
country
and
that
an
appropriation
of
about
would
be
required
to
meet
the
annual
expenses
including
salaries
involved
in
discharging
the
duties
of
the
commission
the
report
was
transmitted
to
congress
by
special
message
of
april
with
the
following
favorable
comment
upon
the
labors
of
the
commission
if
sustained
by
congress
i
have
no
doubt
the
rules
can
after
the
experience
gained
be
so
improved
and
enforced
as
to
still
more
materially
benefit
the
public
service
and
relieve
the
executive
members
of
congress
and
the
heads
of
departments
from
influences
prejudicial
to
good
administration
the
rules
as
they
have
hitherto
been
enforced
have
resulted
beneficially
as
is
shown
by
the
opinions
of
the
members
of
the
cabinet
and
their
subordinates
in
the
departments
and
in
that
opinion
i
concur
and
in
the
annual
message
of
december
of
the
same
year
similar
views
are
expressed
and
an
appropriation
for
continuing
the
work
of
the
commission
again
advised
the
appropriation
was
not
made
and
as
a
consequence
the
active
work
of
the
commission
was
suspended
leaving
the
commission
itself
still
in
existence
without
the
means
therefore
of
causing
qualifications
to
be
tested
in
any
systematic
manner
or
of
securing
for
the
public
service
the
advantages
of
competition
upon
any
extensive
plan
i
recommended
in
my
annual
message
of
december
the
making
of
an
appropriation
for
the
resumption
of
the
work
of
the
commission
in
the
meantime
however
competitive
examinations
under
many
embarrassments
have
been
conducted
within
limited
spheres
in
the
executive
departments
in
washington
and
in
a
number
of
the
customhouses
and
postoffices
of
the
principal
cities
of
the
country
with
a
view
to
further
test
their
effects
and
in
every
instance
they
have
been
found
to
be
as
salutary
as
they
are
stated
to
have
been
under
the
administration
of
my
predecessor
i
think
the
economy
purity
and
efficiency
of
the
public
service
would
be
greatly
promoted
by
their
systematic
introduction
wherever
practicable
throughout
the
entire
civil
service
of
the
government
together
with
ample
provision
for
their
general
supervision
in
order
to
secure
consistency
and
uniform
justice
reports
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
from
the
postmastergeneral
from
the
postmaster
in
the
city
of
new
york
where
such
examinations
have
been
some
time
on
trial
and
also
from
the
collector
of
the
port
the
naval
officer
and
the
surveyor
in
that
city
and
from
the
postmasters
and
collectors
in
several
of
the
other
large
cities
show
that
the
competitive
system
where
applied
has
in
various
ways
contributed
to
improve
the
public
service
the
reports
show
that
the
results
have
been
salutary
in
a
marked
degree
and
that
the
general
application
of
similar
rules
can
not
fail
to
be
of
decided
benefit
to
the
service
the
reports
of
the
government
officers
in
the
city
of
new
york
especially
bear
decided
testimony
to
the
utility
of
open
competitive
examinations
in
their
respective
offices
showing
thatthese
examinations
and
the
excellent
qualifications
of
those
admitted
to
the
service
through
them
have
had
a
marked
incidental
effect
upon
the
persons
previously
in
the
service
and
particularly
upon
those
aspiring
to
promotion
there
has
been
on
the
part
of
these
latter
an
increased
interest
in
the
work
and
a
desire
to
extend
acquaintance
with
it
beyond
the
particular
desk
occupied
and
thus
the
morale
of
the
entire
force
has
been
raised
the
examinations
have
been
attended
by
many
citizens
who
have
had
an
opportunity
to
thoroughly
investigate
the
scope
and
character
of
the
tests
and
the
method
of
determining
the
results
and
those
visitors
have
without
exception
approved
the
methods
employed
and
several
of
them
have
publicly
attested
their
favorable
opinion
upon
such
considerations
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
renew
the
recommendation
contained
in
my
annual
message
of
december
requesting
congress
to
make
the
necessary
appropriation
for
the
resumption
of
the
work
of
the
civil
service
commission
economy
will
be
promoted
by
authorizing
a
moderate
compensation
to
persons
in
the
public
service
who
may
perform
extra
labor
upon
or
under
the
commission
as
the
executive
may
direct
i
am
convinced
that
if
a
just
and
adequate
test
of
merit
is
enforced
for
admission
to
the
public
service
and
in
making
promotions
such
abuses
as
removals
without
good
cause
and
partisan
and
official
interference
with
the
proper
exercise
of
the
appointing
power
will
in
large
measure
disappear
there
are
other
administrative
abuses
to
which
the
attention
of
congress
should
be
asked
in
this
connection
mere
partisan
appointments
and
the
constant
peril
of
removal
without
cause
very
naturally
lead
to
an
absorbing
and
mischievous
political
activity
on
the
part
of
those
thus
appointed
which
not
only
interferes
with
the
due
discharge
of
official
duty
but
is
incompatible
with
the
freedom
of
elections
not
without
warrant
in
the
views
of
several
of
my
predecessors
in
the
presidential
office
and
directly
within
the
law
of
already
cited
i
endeavored
by
regulation
made
on
the
d
day
of
june
to
put
some
reasonable
limits
to
such
abuses
it
may
not
be
easy
and
it
may
never
perhaps
be
necessary
to
define
with
precision
the
proper
limit
of
political
action
on
the
part
of
federal
officers
but
while
their
right
to
hold
and
freely
express
their
opinions
can
not
be
questioned
it
is
very
plain
that
they
should
neither
be
allowed
to
devote
to
other
subjects
the
time
needed
for
the
proper
discharge
of
their
official
duties
nor
to
use
the
authority
of
their
office
to
enforce
their
own
opinions
or
to
coerce
the
political
action
of
those
who
hold
different
opinions
reasons
of
justice
and
public
policy
quite
analogous
to
those
which
forbid
the
use
of
official
power
for
the
oppression
of
the
private
citizen
impose
upon
the
government
the
duty
of
protecting
its
officers
and
agents
from
arbitrary
exactions
in
whatever
aspect
considered
the
practice
of
making
levies
for
party
purposes
upon
the
salaries
of
officers
is
highly
demoralizing
to
the
public
service
and
discreditable
to
the
country
though
an
officer
should
be
as
free
as
any
other
citizen
to
give
his
own
money
in
aid
of
his
opinions
or
his
party
he
should
also
be
as
free
as
any
other
citizen
to
refuse
to
make
such
gifts
if
salaries
are
but
a
fair
compensation
for
the
time
and
labor
of
the
officer
it
is
gross
injustice
to
levy
a
tax
upon
them
if
they
are
made
excessive
in
order
that
they
may
bear
the
tax
the
excess
is
an
indirect
robbery
of
the
public
funds
i
recommend
therefore
such
a
revision
and
extension
of
present
statutes
as
shall
secure
to
those
in
every
grade
of
official
life
or
public
employment
the
protection
with
which
a
great
and
enlightened
nation
should
guard
those
who
are
faithful
in
its
service
our
relations
with
foreign
countries
have
continued
peaceful
with
great
britain
there
are
still
unsettled
questions
growing
out
of
the
local
laws
of
the
maritime
provinces
and
the
action
of
provincial
authorities
deemed
to
be
in
derogation
of
rights
secured
by
treaty
to
american
fishermen
the
united
states
minister
in
london
has
been
instructed
to
present
a
demand
for
in
view
of
the
damages
received
by
american
citizens
at
fortune
bay
on
the
th
day
of
january
the
subject
has
been
taken
into
consideration
by
the
british
government
and
an
early
reply
is
anticipated
upon
the
completion
of
the
necessary
preliminary
examinations
the
subject
of
our
participation
in
the
provincial
fisheries
as
regulated
by
treaty
will
at
once
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
british
government
with
a
view
to
an
early
and
permanent
settlement
of
the
whole
question
which
was
only
temporarily
adjusted
by
the
treaty
of
washington
efforts
have
been
made
to
obtain
the
removal
of
restrictions
found
injurious
to
the
exportation
of
cattle
to
the
united
kingdom
some
correspondence
has
also
occurred
with
regard
to
the
rescue
and
saving
of
life
and
property
upon
the
lakes
which
has
resulted
in
important
modifications
of
the
previous
regulations
of
the
dominion
government
on
the
subject
in
the
interest
of
humanity
and
commerce
in
accordance
with
the
joint
resolution
of
the
last
session
of
congress
commissioners
were
appointed
to
represent
the
united
states
at
the
two
international
exhibitions
in
australia
one
of
which
is
now
in
progress
at
sydney
and
the
other
to
be
held
next
year
at
melbourne
a
desire
has
been
expressed
by
our
merchants
and
manufacturers
interested
in
the
important
and
growing
trade
with
australia
that
an
increased
provision
should
be
made
by
congress
for
the
representation
of
our
industries
at
the
melbourne
exhibition
of
next
year
and
the
subject
is
respectfully
submitted
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
assent
of
the
government
has
been
given
to
the
landing
on
the
coast
of
massachusetts
of
a
new
and
independent
transatlantic
cable
between
france
by
way
of
the
french
island
of
st
pierre
and
this
country
subject
to
any
future
legislation
of
congress
on
the
subject
the
conditions
imposed
before
allowing
this
connection
with
our
shores
to
be
established
are
such
as
to
secure
its
competition
with
any
existing
or
future
lines
of
marine
cable
and
preclude
amalgamation
therewith

to
provide
for
entire
equality
of
rights
to
our
government
and
people
with
those
of
france
in
the
use
of
the
cable
and
prevent
any
exclusive
possession
of
the
privilege
as
accorded
by
france
to
the
disadvantage
of
any
future
cable
communication
between
france
and
the
united
states
which
may
be
projected
and
accomplished
by
our
citizens
an
important
reduction
of
the
present
rates
of
cable
communication
with
europe
felt
to
be
too
burdensome
to
the
interests
of
our
commerce
must
necessarily
flow
from
the
establishment
of
this
competing
line
the
attention
of
congress
was
drawn
to
the
propriety
of
some
general
regulation
by
congress
of
the
whole
subject
of
transmarine
cables
by
my
predecessor
in
his
message
of
december
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
consideration
the
importance
of
congressional
action
in
the
matter
the
questions
of
grave
importance
with
spain
growing
out
of
the
incidents
of
the
cuban
insurrection
have
been
for
the
most
part
happily
and
honorably
settled
it
may
reasonably
be
anticipated
that
the
commission
now
sitting
in
washington
for
the
decision
of
private
cases
in
this
connection
will
soon
be
able
to
bring
its
labors
to
a
conclusion
the
longstanding
question
of
east
florida
claims
has
lately
been
renewed
as
a
subject
of
correspondence
and
may
possibly
require
congressional
action
for
its
final
disposition
a
treaty
with
the
netherlands
with
respect
to
consular
rights
and
privileges
similar
to
those
with
other
powers
has
been
signed
and
ratified
and
the
ratifications
were
exchanged
on
the
st
of
july
last
negotiations
for
extradition
treaties
with
the
netherlands
and
with
denmark
are
now
in
progress
some
questions
with
switzerland
in
regard
to
pauper
and
convict
emigrants
have
arisen
but
it
is
not
doubted
that
they
will
be
arranged
upon
a
just
and
satisfactory
basis
a
question
has
also
occurred
with
respect
to
an
asserted
claim
by
swiss
municipal
authorities
to
exercise
tutelage
over
persons
and
property
of
swiss
citizens
naturalized
in
this
country
it
is
possible
this
may
require
adjustment
by
treaty
with
the
german
empire
frequent
questions
arise
in
connection
with
the
subjects
of
naturalization
and
expatriation
but
the
imperial
government
has
constantly
manifested
a
desire
to
strictly
maintain
and
comply
with
all
treaty
stipulations
in
regard
to
them
in
consequence
of
the
omission
of
congress
to
provide
for
a
diplomatic
representative
at
athens
the
legation
to
greece
has
been
withdrawn
there
is
now
no
channel
of
diplomatic
communication
between
the
two
countries
and
the
expediency
of
providing
for
one
in
some
form
is
submitted
to
congress
relations
with
austria
russia
italy
portugal
turkey
and
belgium
continue
amicable
and
marked
by
no
incident
of
especial
importance
a
change
of
the
personal
head
of
the
government
of
egypt
has
taken
place
no
change
however
has
occurred
in
the
relations
between
egypt
and
the
united
states
the
action
of
the
egyptian
government
in
presenting
to
the
city
of
new
york
one
of
the
ancient
obelisks
which
possess
such
historic
interest
is
highly
appreciated
as
a
generous
mark
of
international
regard
if
prosperity
should
attend
the
enterprise
of
its
transportation
across
the
atlantic
its
erection
in
a
conspicuous
position
in
the
chief
commercial
city
of
the
nation
will
soon
be
accomplished
the
treaty
recently
made
between
japan
and
the
united
states
in
regard
to
the
revision
of
former
commercial
treaties
it
is
now
believed
will
be
followed
by
similar
action
on
the
part
of
other
treaty
powers
the
attention
of
congress
is
again
invited
to
the
subject
of
the
indemnity
funds
received
some
years
since
from
japan
and
china
which
with
their
accumulated
interest
now
amount
to
considerable
sums
if
any
part
of
these
funds
is
justly
due
to
american
citizens
they
should
receive
it
promptly
and
whatever
may
have
been
received
by
this
government
in
excess
of
strictly
just
demands
should
in
some
form
be
returned
to
the
nations
to
whom
it
equitably
belongs
the
government
of
china
has
signified
its
willingness
to
consider
the
question
of
the
emigration
of
its
subjects
to
the
united
states
with
a
dispassionate
fairness
and
to
cooperate
in
such
measures
as
may
tend
to
prevent
injurious
consequences
to
the
united
states
the
negotiations
are
still
proceeding
and
will
be
pressed
with
diligence
a
question
having
arisen
between
china
and
japan
about
the
lew
chew
islands
the
united
states
government
has
taken
measures
to
inform
those
powers
of
its
readiness
to
extend
its
good
offices
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
if
they
shall
mutually
deem
it
desirable
and
find
it
practicable
to
avail
themselves
of
the
proffer
it
is
a
gratification
to
be
able
to
announce
that
through
the
judicious
and
energetic
action
of
the
military
commanders
of
the
two
nations
on
each
side
of
the
rio
grande
under
the
instructions
of
their
respective
governments
raids
and
depredations
have
greatly
decreased
and
in
the
localities
where
formerly
most
destructive
have
now
almost
wholly
ceased
in
view
of
this
result
i
entertain
a
confident
expectation
that
the
prevalence
of
quiet
on
the
border
will
soon
become
so
assured
as
to
justify
a
modification
of
the
present
orders
to
our
military
commanders
as
to
crossing
the
border
without
encouraging
such
disturbances
as
would
endanger
the
peace
of
the
two
countries
the
third
installment
of
the
award
against
mexico
under
the
claims
commission
of
july
was
duly
paid
and
has
been
put
in
course
of
distribution
in
pursuance
of
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
same
this
satisfactory
situation
between
the
two
countries
leads
me
to
anticipate
an
expansion
of
our
trade
with
mexico
and
an
increased
contribution
of
capital
and
industry
by
our
people
to
the
development
of
the
great
resources
of
that
country
i
earnestly
commend
to
the
wisdom
of
congress
the
provision
of
suitable
legislation
looking
to
this
result
diplomatic
intercourse
with
colombia
is
again
fully
restored
by
the
arrival
of
a
minister
from
that
country
to
the
united
states
this
is
especially
fortunate
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
question
of
an
interoceanic
canal
has
recently
assumed
a
new
and
important
aspect
and
is
now
under
discussion
with
the
central
american
countries
through
whose
territory
the
canal
by
the
nicaragua
route
would
have
to
pass
it
is
trusted
that
enlightened
statesmanship
on
their
part
will
see
that
the
early
prosecution
of
such
a
work
will
largely
inure
to
the
benefit
not
only
of
their
own
citizens
and
those
of
the
united
states
but
of
the
commerce
of
the
civilized
world
it
is
not
doubted
that
should
the
work
be
undertaken
under
the
protective
auspices
of
the
united
states
and
upon
satisfactory
concessions
for
the
right
of
way
and
its
security
by
the
central
american
governments
the
capital
for
its
completion
would
be
readily
furnished
from
this
country
and
europe
which
might
failing
such
guaranties
prove
inaccessible
diplomatic
relations
with
chile
have
also
been
strengthened
by
the
reception
of
a
minister
from
that
country
the
war
between
peru
bolivia
and
chile
still
continues
the
united
states
have
not
deemed
it
proper
to
interpose
in
the
matter
further
than
to
convey
to
all
the
governments
concerned
the
assurance
that
the
friendly
offices
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
for
the
restoration
of
peace
upon
an
honorable
basis
will
be
extended
in
case
the
belligerents
shall
exhibit
a
readiness
to
accept
them
cordial
relations
continue
with
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
and
trade
with
those
countries
is
improving
a
provision
for
regular
and
more
frequent
mail
communication
in
our
own
ships
between
the
ports
of
this
country
and
the
nations
of
south
america
seems
to
me
to
deserve
the
attention
of
congress
as
an
essential
precursor
of
an
enlargement
of
our
commerce
with
them
and
an
extension
of
our
carrying
trade
a
recent
revolution
in
venezuela
has
been
followed
by
the
establishment
of
a
provisional
government
this
government
has
not
yet
been
formally
recognized
and
it
is
deemed
desirable
to
await
the
proposed
action
of
the
people
which
is
expected
to
give
it
the
sanction
of
constitutional
forms
a
naval
vessel
has
been
sent
to
the
samoan
islands
to
make
surveys
and
take
possession
of
the
privileges
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
samoa
in
the
harbor
of
pagopago
a
coaling
station
is
to
be
established
there
which
will
be
convenient
and
useful
to
united
states
vessels
the
subject
of
opening
diplomatic
relations
with
roumania
and
servia
now
become
independent
sovereignties
is
at
present
under
consideration
and
is
the
subject
of
diplomatic
correspondence
there
is
a
gratifying
increase
of
trade
with
nearly
all
european
and
american
countries
and
it
is
believed
that
with
judicious
action
in
regard
to
its
development
it
can
and
will
be
still
more
enhanced
and
that
american
products
and
manufactures
will
find
new
and
expanding
markets
the
reports
of
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
upon
this
subject
under
the
system
now
adopted
have
resulted
in
obtaining
much
valuable
information
which
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
laid
before
congress
and
the
public
from
time
to
time
the
third
article
of
the
treaty
with
russia
of
march
by
which
alaska
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
provides
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
ceded
territory
with
the
exception
of
the
uncivilized
native
tribes
shall
be
admitted
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
the
rights
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
shall
be
maintained
and
protected
in
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
liberty
property
and
religion
the
uncivilized
tribes
are
subject
to
such
laws
and
regulations
as
the
united
states
may
from
time
to
time
adopt
in
regard
to
the
aboriginal
tribes
of
that
country
both
the
obligations
of
this
treaty
and
the
necessities
of
the
people
require
that
some
organized
form
of
government
over
the
territory
of
alaska
be
adopted
there
appears
to
be
no
law
for
the
arrest
of
persons
charged
with
commonlaw
offenses
such
as
assault
robbery
and
murder
and
no
magistrate
authorized
to
issue
or
execute
process
in
such
cases
serious
difficulties
have
already
arisen
from
offenses

of
this
character
not
only
among
the
original
inhabitants
but
among
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
other
countries
who
have
engaged
in
mining
fishing
and
other
business
operations
within
the
territory
a

authorizing
the
appointment
of
justices
of
the

is
called
to

report
of
the

amounting

prevented
the
application
of
the
full
amount
required
by
law
to
the
sinking
fund
for
the
current
year
but
these
arrears
having
been
substantially
paid
it
is
believed
that
the
sinking
fund
can
hereafter
be
maintained
without
any
change
of
existing
law
the
secretary
of
war
reports
that
the
war
department
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
the
same
being
for
a
less
sum
of
money
than
any
annual
estimate
rendered
to
congress
from
that
department
during
a
period
of
at
least
twelve
years
he
concurs
with
the
general
of
the
army
in
recommending
such
legislation
as
will
authorize
the
enlistment
of
the
full
number
of
men
for
the
line
of
the
army
exclusive
of
the
men
required
for
detached
duty
and
therefore
not
available
for
service
in
the
field
he
also
recommends
that
congress
be
asked
to
provide
by
law
for
the
disposition
of
a
large
number
of
abandoned
military
posts
and
reservations
which
though
very
valuable
in
themselves
have
been
rendered
useless
for
military
purposes
by
the
advance
of
civilization
and
settlement
he
unites
with
the
quartermastergeneral
in
recommending
that
an
appropriation
be
made
for
the
construction
of
a
cheap
and
perfectly
fireproof
building
for
the
safe
storage
of
a
vast
amount
of
money
accounts
vouchers
claims
and
other
valuable
records
now
in
the
quartermastergenerals
office
and
exposed
to
great
risk
of
total
destruction
by
fire
he
also
recommends
in
conformity
with
the
views
of
the
judgeadvocategeneral
some
declaratory
legislation
in
reference
to
the
military
statute
of
limitations
as
applied
to
the
crime
of
desertion
in
these
several
recommendations

concur
the

of

further
reports
that
the
work
for
the
improvement
of
the
south
pass
of
the
mississippi
river
under
contract
with
mr
james
b
eads
made
in
pursuance
of
an
act
of
congress
has
been
prosecuted
during
the
past
year
with
a
greater
measure
of
success
in
the
attainment
of
results
than
during
any
previous
year
the
channel
through
the
south
pass
which
at
the
beginning
of
operations
in
june
had
a
depth
of
only
feet
of
water
had
on
the
th
of
july
a
minimum
depth
of
feet
having
a
width
of
not
less
than
feet
and
a
central
depth
of

payments
have
been
made

with
the
statute
as
the
work
progressed
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
and
further
payments
will
become
due
as
provided
by
the
statute
in
the
event
of
success
in
maintaining
the
channel
now
secured
the
reports
of
the
general
of
the
army
and
of
his
subordinates
present
a
full
and
detailed
account
of
the
military
operations
for
the
suppression
of
hostilities
among
the
indians
of
the
ute
and
apache
tribes
and
praise
is
justly
awarded
to
the
officers
and
troops
engaged
for
promptness
skill
and
courage
displayed
the
past
year
has
been
one
of
almost
unbroken
peace
and
quiet
on
the
mexican
frontier
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
efforts
of
this
government
and
of
mexico
to
maintain
order
in
that
region
will
prove
permanently
successful
this
department
was
enabled
during
the
past
year
to
find
temporary
though
crowded
accommodations
and
a
safe
depository
for
a
portion
of
its
records
in
the
completed
east
wing
of
the
building
designed
for
the
state

and
navy
departments
the
construction
of
the
north
wing
of
the
building
a
part
of
the
structure
intended
for
the
use
of
the
war
department
is
being
carried
forward
with
all
possible
dispatch
and
the
work
should
receive
from
congress
such
liberal
appropriations
as
will
secure
its
speedy
completion
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
continued
improvement
in
that
branch
of
the
service
during
the
last
fiscal
year
extensive
repairs
have
been
made
upon
vessels
and
two
new
ships
have
been
completed
and
made
ready
for
sea
the
total
expenditures
of
the
year
ended
june
including
specific
appropriations
not
estimated
for
by
the
department
were
the
expenses
chargeable
to
the
year
after
deducting
the
amount
of
these
specific
appropriations
were
but
this
is
subject
to
a
reduction
of
that
amount
having
been
drawn
upon
warrants
but
not
paid
out
during
the
year
the
amount
of
appropriations
applicable
to
the
last
fiscal
year
was
there
was
therefore
a
balance
of
remaining
unexpended
and
to
the
credit
of
the
department
on
june
the
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
which
exceeds
the
appropriations
for
the
present
fiscal
year
the
reason
for
this
increase
is
explained
in
the
secretarys
report
the
appropriations
available
for
the
present
fiscal
year
are
which
will
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
answer
all
the
ordinary
demands
of
the
service
the
amount
drawn
from
the
treasury
from
july
to
november
was
of
which
has
been
refunded
leaving
as
the
expenditure
for
that
period
if
the
expenditures
of
the
remaining
twothirds
of
the
year
do
not
exceed
the
proportion
for
these
four
months
there
will
remain
unexpended
at
the
end
of
the
year
of
the
current
appropriations
the
report
of
the
secretary
shows
the
gratifying
fact
that
among
all
the
disbursing
officers
of
the
pay
corps
of
the
navy
there
is
not
one
who
is
a
defaulter
to
the
extent
of
a
single
dollar
i
unite
with
him
in
recommending
the
removal
of
the
observatory
to
a
more
healthful
location
that
institution
reflects
credit
upon
the
nation
and
has
obtained
the
approbation
of
scientific
men
in
all
parts
of
the
world
its
removal
from
its
present
location
would
not
only
be
conducive
to
the
health
of
its
officers
and
professors
but
would
greatly
increase
its
usefulness
the
appropriation
for
judicial
expenses
which
has
heretofore
been
made
for
the
department
of
justice
in
gross
was
subdivided
at
the
last
session
of
congress
and
no
appropriation
whatever
was
made
for
the
payment
of
the
fees
of
marshals
and
their
deputies
either
in
the
service
of
process
or
for
the
discharge
of
other
duties
and
since
june
these
officers
have
continued
the
performance
of
their
duties
without
compensation
from
the
government
taking
upon
themselves
the
necessary
incidental
outlays
as
well
as
rendering
their
own
services
in
only
a
few
unavoidable
instances
has
the
proper
execution
of
the
process
of
the
united
states
failed
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
the
requisite
appropriation
this
course
of
official
conduct
on
the
part
of
these
officers
highly
creditable
to
their
fidelity
was
advised
by
the
attorneygeneral
who
informed
them
however
that
they
would
necessarily
have
to
rely
for
their
compensation
upon
the
prospect
of
future
legislation
by
congress
i
therefore
especially
recommend
that
immediate
appropriation
be
made
by
congress
for
this
purpose
the
act
making
the
principal
appropriation
for
the
department
of
justice
at
previous
sessions
has
uniformly
contained
the
following
clause
and
for
defraying
the
expenses
which
my
be
incurred
in
the
enforcement
of
the
act
approved
february
entitled
an
act
to
amend
an
act
approved
may
entitled
an
act
to
enforce
the
rights
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
vote
in
the
several
states
of
this
union
and
for
other
purposes
or
any
acts
amendatory
thereof
or
supplementary
thereto
no
appropriation
was
made
for
this
purpose
for
the
current
year
as
no
general
election
for
members
of
congress
occurred
the
omission
was
a
matter
of
little
practical
importance
such
election
will
however
take
place
during
the
ensuing
year
and
the
appropriation
made
for
the
pay
of
marshals
and
deputies
should
be
sufficient
to
embrace
compensation
for
the
services
they
may
be
required
to
perform
at
such
elections
the
business
of
the
supreme
court
is
at
present
largely
in
arrears
it
can
not
be
expected
that
more
causes
can
be
decided
than
are
now
disposed
of
in
its
annual
session
or
that
by
any
assiduity
the
distinguished
magistrates
who
compose
the
court
can
accomplish
more
than
is
now
done
in
the
courts
of
many
of
the
circuits
also
the
business
has
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
the
delay
of
justice
will
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
an
appropriate
remedy
it
is
believed
that
all
is
done
in
each
circuit
which
can
fairly
be
expected
from
its
judicial
force
the
evils
arising
from
delay
are
less
heavily
felt
by
the
united
states
than
by
private
suitors
as
its
causes
are
advanced
by
the
courts
when
it
is
seen
that
they
involve
the
discussion
of
questions
of
a
public
character
the
remedy
suggested
by
the
attorneygeneral
is
the
appointment
of
additional
circuit
judges
and
the
creation
of
an
intermediate
court
of
errors
a
nd
appeals
which
shall
relieve
the
supreme
court
of
a
part
of
its
jurisdiction
while
a
larger
force
is
also
obtained
for
the
performance
of
circuit
duties
i
commend
this
suggestion
to
the
consideration
of
congress
it
would
seem
to
afford
a
complete
remedy
and
would
involve
if
ten
additional
circuit
judges
are
appointed
an
expenditure
at
the
present
rate
of
salaries
of
not
more
than
a
year
which
would
certainly
be
small
in
comparison
with
the
objects
to
be
attained
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
bears
testimony
to
the
general
revival
of
business
throughout
the
country
the
receipts
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
were
being
more
than
the
revenues
of
the
preceding
year
the
amount
realized
from
the
sale
of
postage
stamps
stamped
envelopes
and
postal
cards
was
more
than
in
the
preceding
year
and
more
than
in
the
expenditures
of
the
department
were
of
which
the
sum
of
was
paid
on
liabilities
incurred
in
preceding
years
the
expenditures
during
the
year
were
less
than
in
the
preceding
year
this
reduction
is
to
be
attributed
mainly
to
the
operation
of
the
law
passed
june
changing
the
compensation
of
postmasters
from
a
commission
on
the
value
of
stamps
sold
to
a
commission
on
stamps
canceled
the
amount
drawn
from
the
treasury
on
appropriations
in
addition
to
the
revenues
of
the
department
was
being
less
than
in
the
preceding
year
the
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
estimated
at
and
the
receipts
from
all
sources
at
leaving
a
deficiency
to
be
appropriated
for
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
relations
of
the
department
with
railroad
companies
have
been
harmonized
notwithstanding
the
general
reduction
by
congress
of
their
compensation
by
the
appropriation
for
special
facilities
and
the
railway
postoffice
lines
have
been
greatly
extended
especially
in
the
southern
states
the
interests
of
the
railway
mail
service
and
of
the
public
would
be
greatly
promoted
and
the
expenditures
could
be
more
readily
controlled
by
the
classification
of
the
employees
of
the
railway
mail
service
as
recommended
by
the
postmastergeneral
the
appropriation
for
salaries
with
respect
to
which
the
maximum
limit
is
already
fixed
by
law
to
be
made
in
gross
the
postmastergeneral
recommends
an
amendment
of
the
law
regulating
the
increase
of
compensation
for
increased
service
and
increased
speed
on
star
routes
so
as
to
enable
him
to
advertise
for
proposals
for
such
increased
service
and
speed
he
also
suggests
the
advantages
to
accrue
to
the
commerce
of
the
country
from
the
enactment
of
a
general
law
authorizing
contracts
with
americanbuilt
steamers
carrying
the
american
flag
for
transporting
the
mail
between
ports
of
the
united
states
and
ports
of
the
west
indies
and
south
america
at
a
fixed
maximum
price
per
mile
the
amount
to
be
expended
being
regulated
by
annual
appropriations
in
like
manner
with
the
amount
paid
for
the
domestic
star
service
the
arrangement
made
by
the
postmastergeneral
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
the
collection
of
duty
upon
books
received
in
the
mail
from
foreign
countries
has
proved
so
satisfactory
in
its
practical
operation
that
the
recommendation
is
now
made
that
congress
shall
extend
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
march
under
which
this
arrangement
was
made
so
as
to
apply
to
all
other
dutiable
articles
received
in
the
mails
from
foreign
countries
the
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
setting
forth
the
present
state
of
our
relations
with
the
indian
tribes
on
our
territory
the
measures
taken
to
advance
their
civilization
and
prosperity
and
the
progress
already
achieved
by
them
will
be
found
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
the
general
conduct
of
our
indian
population
has
been
so
satisfactory
that
the
occurrence
of
two
disturbances
which
resulted
in
bloodshed
and
destruction
of
property
is
all
the
more
to
be
lamented
the
history
of
the
outbreak
on
the
white
river
ute
reservation
in
western
colorado
has
become
so
familiar
by
elaborate
reports
in
the
public
press
that
its
remarkable
incidents
need
not
be
stated
here
in
detail
it
is
expected
that
the
settlement
of
this
difficulty
will
lead
to
such
arrangements
as
will
prevent
further
hostile
contact
between
the
indians
and
the
border
settlements
in
western
colorado
the
other
disturbance
occurred
at
the
mescalero
agency
in
new
mexico
where
victoria
at
the
head
of
a
small
band
of
marauders
after
committing
many
atrocities
being
vigorously
chased
by
a
military
force
made
his
way
across
the
mexican
border
and
is
now
on
foreign
soil
while
these
occurrences
in
which
a
comparatively
small
number
of
indians
were
engaged
are
most
deplorable
a
vast
majority
of
our
indian
population
have
fully
justified
the
expectations
of
those
who
believe
that
by
humane
and
peaceful
influences
the
indian
can
be
led
to
abandon
the
habits
of
savage
life
and
to
develop
a
capacity
for
useful
and
civilized
occupations
what
they
have
already
accomplished
in
the
pursuit
of
agricultural
and
mechanical
work
the
remarkable
success
which
has
attended
the
experiment
of
employing
as
freighters
a
class
of
indians
hitherto
counted
among
the
wildest
and
most
intractable
and
the
general
and
urgent
desire
expressed
by
them
for
the
education
of
their
children
may
be
taken
as
sufficient
proof
that
they
will
be
found
capable
of
accomplishing
much
more
if
they
continue
to
be
wisely
and
fairly
guided
the
indian
policy
sketched
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
object
of
which
is
to
make
liberal
provision
for
the
education
of
indian
youth
to
settle
the
indians
upon
farm
lots
in
severalty
to
give
them
title
in
fee
to
their
farms
inalienable
for
a
certain
number
of
years
and
when
their
wants
are
thus
provided
for
to
dispose
by
sale
of
the
lands
on
their
reservations
not
occupied
and
used
by
them
a
fund
to
be
formed
out
of
the
proceeds
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
which
will
gradually
relieve
the
government
of
the
expenses
now
provided
for
by
annual
appropriations
must
commend
itself
as
just
and
beneficial
to
the
indians
and
as
also
calculated
to
remove
those
obstructions
which
the
existence
of
large
reservations
presents
to
the
settlement
and
development
of
the
country
i
therefore
earnestly
recommend
the
enactment
of
a
law
enabling
the
government
to
give
indians
a
title
in
fee
inalienable
for
twentyfive
years
to
the
farm
lands
assigned
to
them
by
allotment
i
also
repeat
the
recommendation
made
in
my
first
annual
message
that
a
law
be
passed
admitting
indians
who
can
give
satisfactory
proof
of
having
by
their
own
labor
supported
their
families
for
a
number
of
years
and
who
are
willing
to
detach
themselves
from
their
tribal
relations
to
the
benefit
of
the
homestead
act
and
to
grant
them
patents
containing
the
same
provision
of
inalienability
for
a
certain
period
the
experiment
of
sending
a
number
of
indian
children
of
both
sexes
to
the
hampton
normal
and
agricultural
institute
in
virginia
to
receive
an
elementary
english
education
and
practical
instruction
in
farming
and
other
useful
industries
has
led
to
results
so
promising
that
it
was
thought
expedient
to
turn
over
the
cavalry
barracks
at
carlisle
in
pennsylvania
to
the
interior
department
for
the
establishment
of
an
indian
school
on
a
larger
scale
this
school
has
now
pupils
selected
from
various
tribes
and
is
in
full
operation
arrangements
are
also
made
for
the
education
of
a
number
of
indian
boys
and
girls
belonging
to
tribes
on
the
pacific
slope
in
a
similar
manner
at
forest
grove
in
oregon
these
institutions
will
commend
themselves
to
the
liberality
of
congress
and
to
the
philanthropic
munificence
of
the
american
people
last
spring
information
was
received
of
the
organization
of
an
extensive
movement
in
the
western
states
the
object
of
which
was
the
occupation
by
unauthorized
persons
of
certain
lands
in
the
indian
territory
ceded
by
the
cherokees
to
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
settlement
by
other
indian
tribes
on
the
th
of
april
i
issued
a
proclamation
warning
all
persons
against
participation
in
such
an
attempt
and
by
the
cooperation
of
a
military
force
the
invasion
was
promptly
checked
it
is
my
purpose
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
indian
inhabitants
of
that
territory
to
the
full
extent
of
the
executive
power
but
it
would
be
unwise
to
ignore
the
fact
that
a
territory
so
large
and
so
fertile
with
a
population
so
sparse
and
with
so
great
a
wealth
of
unused
resources
will
be
found
more
exposed
to
the
repetition
of
such
attempts
as
happened
this
year
when
the
surrounding
states
are
more
densely
settled
and
the
westward
movement
of
our
population
looks
still
more
eagerly
for
fresh
lands
to
occupy
under
such
circumstances
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
the
indian
territory
in
its
present
state
will
greatly
increase
and
the
indian
tribes
inhabiting
it
would
do
well
to
prepare
for
such
a
contingency
i
therefore
fully
approve
of
the
advice
given
to
them
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
on
a
recent
occasion
to
divide
among
themselves
in
severalty
as
large
a
quantity
of
their
lands
as
they
can
cultivate
to
acquire
individual
title
in
fee
instead
of
their
present
tribal
ownership
in
common
and
to
consider
in
what
manner
the
balance
of
their
lands
may
be
disposed
of
by
the
government
for
their
benefit
by
adopting
such
a
policy
they
would
more
certainly
secure
for
themselves
the
value
of
their
possessions
and
at
the
same
time
promote
their
progress
in
civilization
and
prosperity
than
by
endeavoring
to
perpetuate
the
present
state
of
things
in
the
territory
the
question
whether
a
change
in
the
control
of
the
indian
service
should
be
made
was
in
the
fortyfifth
congress
referred
to
a
joint
committee
of
both
houses
for
inquiry
and
report
in
my
last
annual
message
i
expressed
the
hope
that
the
decision
of
that
question
then
in
prospect
would
arrest
further
agitation
of
this
subject
such
agitation
being
apt
to
produce
a
disturbing
effect
upon
the
service
as
well
as
on
the
indians
themselves
since
then
the
committee
having
reported
the
question
has
been
decided
in
the
negative
by
a

vote
in
the
house
of
representatives
for
the
reasons
here
stated
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
further
uncertainty
on
this
point
will
be
calculated
to
obstruct
other
muchneeded
legislation
to
weaken
the
discipline
of
the
service
and
to
unsettle
salutary
measures
now
in
progress
for
the
government
and
improvement
of
the
indians
i
respectfully
recommend
that
the
decision
arrived
at
by
congress
at
its
last
session
be
permitted
to
stand
the
efforts
made
by
the
department
of
the
interior
to
arrest
the
depredations
on
the
timber
lands
of
the
united
states
have
been
continued
and
have
met
with
considerable
success
a
large
number
of
cases
of
trespass
have
been
prosecuted
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
others
have
been
settled
the
trespassers
offering
to
make
payment
to
the
government
for
the
value
of
the
timber
taken
by
them
the
proceeds
of
these
prosecutions
and
settlements
turned
into
the
treasury
far
exceed
in
amount
the
sums
appropriated
by
congress
for
this
purpose
a
more
important
result
however
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
destruction
of
our
public
forests
by
depredation
although
such
cases
still
occur
has
been
greatly
reduced
in
extent
and
it
is
probable
that
if
the
present
policy
is
vigorously
pursued
and
sufficient
provision
to
that
end
is
made
by
congress
such
trespasses
at
least
those
on
a
large
scale
can
be
entirely
suppressed
except
in
the
territories
where
timber
for
the
daily
requirements
of
the
population
can
not
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
be
otherwise
obtained
i
therefore
earnestly
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
recommendation
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
a
law
be
enacted
enabling
the
government
to
sell
timber
from
the
public
lands
without
conveying
the
fee
where
such
lands
are
principally
valuable
for
the
timber
thereon
such
sales
to
be
so
regulated
as
to
conform
to
domestic
wants
and
business
requirements
while
at
the
same
time
guarding
against
a
sweeping
destruction
of
the
forests
the
enactment
of
such
a
law
appears
to
become
a
more
pressing
necessity
every
day
my
recommendations
in
former
messages
are
renewed
in
favor
of
enlarging
the
facilities
of
the
department
of
agriculture
agriculture
is
the
leading
interest
and
the
permanent
industry
of
our
people
it
is
to
the
abundance
of
agricultural
production
as
compared
with
our
home
consumption
and
the
largely
increased
and
highly
profitable
market
abroad
which
we
have
enjoyed
in
recent
years
that
we
are
mainly
indebted
for
our
present
prosperity
as
a
people
we
must
look
for
its
continued
maintenance
to
the
same
substantial
resource
there
is
no
branch
of
industry
in
which
labor
directed
by
scientific
knowledge
yields
such
increased
production
in
comparison
with
unskilled
labor
and
no
branch
of
the
public
service
to
which
the
encouragement
of
liberal
appropriations
can
be
more
appropriately
extended
the
omission
to
render
such
aid
is
not
a
wise
economy
but
on
the
contrary
undoubtedly
results
in
losses
of
immense
sums
annually
that
might
be
saved
through
welldirected
efforts
by
the
government
to
promote
this
vital
interest
the
results
already
accomplished
with
the
very
limited
means
heretofore
placed
at
the
command
of
the
department
of
agriculture
is
an
earnest
of
what
may
be
expected
with
increased
appropriations
for
the
several
purposes
indicated
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
with
a
view
to
placing
the
department
upon
a
footing
which
will
enable
it
to
prosecute
more
effectively
the
objects
for
which
it
is
established
appropriations
are
needed
for
a
more
complete
laboratory
for
the
establishment
of
a
veterinary
division
and
a
division
of
forestry
and
for
an
increase
of
force
the
requirements
for
these
and
other
purposes
indicated
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
under
the
head
of
the
immediate
necessities
of
the
department
will
not
involve
any
expenditure
of
money
that
the
country
can
not
with
propriety
now
undertake
in
the
interests
of
agriculture
it
is
gratifying
to
learn
from
the
bureau
of
education
the
extent
to
which
educational
privileges
throughout
the
united
states
have
been
advanced
during
the
year
no
more
fundamental
responsibility
rests
upon
congress
than
that
of
devising
appropriate
measures
of
financial
aid
to
education
supplemental
to
local
action
in
the
states
and
territories
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
wise
forethought
of
the
founders
of
our
government
has
not
only
furnished
the
basis
for
the
support
of
the
commonschool
systems
of
the
newer
states
but
laid
the
foundations
for
the
maintenance
of
their
universities
and
colleges
of
agriculture
and
the
mechanic
arts
measures
in
accordance
with
this
traditional
policy
for
the
further
benefit
of
all
these
interests
and
the
extension
of
the
same
advantages
to
every
portion
of
the
country
it
is
hoped
will
receive
your
favorable
consideration
to
preserve
and
perpetuate
the
national
literature
should
be
among
the
foremost
cares
of
the
national
legislature
the
library
gathered
at
the
capitol
still
remains
unprovided
with
any
suitable
accommodations
for
its
rapidly
increasing
stores
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
the
collection
increased
as
it
is
by
the
deposits
made
under
the
law
of
copyright
by
domestic
and
foreign
exchanges
and
by
the
scientific
library
of
the
smithsonian
institution
call
for
building
accommodations
which
shall
be
at
once
adequate
and
fireproof
the
location
of
such
a
public
building
which
should
provide
for
the
pressing
necessities
of
the
present
and
for
the
vast
increase
of
the
nations
books
in
the
future
is
a
matter
which
addresses
itself
to
the
discretion
of
congress
it
is
earnestly
recommended
as
a
measure
which
should
unite
all
suffrages
and
which
should
no
longer
be
delayed
the
joint
commission
created
by
the
act
of
congress
of
august
for
the
purpose
of
supervising
and
directing
the
completion
of
the
washington
national
monument
of
which
commission
the
president
is
a
member
has
given
careful
attention
to
this
subject
and
already
the
strengthening
of
the
foundation
has
so
far
progressed
as
to
insure
the
entire
success
of
this
part
of
the
work
a
massive
layer
of
masonry
has
been
introduced
below
the
original
foundation
widening
the
base
increasing
the
stability
of
the
structure
and
rendering
it
possible
to
carry
the
shaft
to
completion
it
is
earnestly
recommended
that
such
further
appropriations
be
made
for
the
continued
prosecution
of
the
work
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
completion
of
this
national
monument
at
an
early
day
in
former
messages
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
subject
i
have
taken
occasion
to
commend
to
congress
the
adoption
of
a
generous
policy
toward
the
district
of
columbia
the
report
of
the
commissioners
of
the
district
herewith
transmitted
contains
suggestions
and
recommendations
to
all
of
which
i
earnestly
invite
your
careful
attention
i
ask
your
early
and
favorable
consideration
of
the
views
which
they
express
as
to
the
urgent
need
of
legislation
for
the
reclamation
of
the
marshes
of
the
potomac
and
its
eastern
branch
within
the
limits
of
the
city
and
for
the
repair
of
the
streets
of
the
capital
heretofore
laid
with
wooden
blocks
and
now
by
decay
rendered
almost
impassable
and
a
source
of
imminent
danger
to
the
health
of
its
citizens
the
means
at
the
disposal
of
the
commissioners
are
wholly
inadequate
for
the
accomplishment
of
these
important
works
and
should
be
supplemented
by
timely
appropriations
from
the
federal
treasury
the
filling
of
the
flats
in
front
of
the
city
will
add
to
the
adjacent
lands
and
parks
now
owned
by
the
united
states
a
large
and
valuable
domain
sufficient
it
is
thought
to
reimburse
its
entire
cost
and
will
also
as
an
incidental
result
secure
the
permanent
improvement
of
the
river
for
the
purposes
of
navigation
the
constitution
having
invested
congress
with
supreme
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
district
of
columbia
its
citizens
must
of
necessity
look
to
congress
alone
for
all
needful
legislation
affecting
their
interests
and
as
the
territory
of
this
district
is
the
common
property
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
equally
with
its
resident
citizens
are
interested
in
the
prosperity
of
their
capital
i
can
not
doubt
that
you
will
be
amply
sustained
by
the
general
voice
of
the
country
in
any
measures
you
may
adopt
for
this
purpose
i
also
invite
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
to
the
wants
of
the
public
schools
of
this
district
as
exhibited
in
the
report
of
the
commissioners
while
the
number
of
pupils
is
rapidly
increasing
no
adequate
provision
exists
for
a
corresponding
increase
of
school
accommodation
and
the
commissioners
are
without
the
means
to
meet
this
urgent
need
a
number
of
the
buildings
now
used
for
school
purposes
are
rented
and
are
in
important
particulars
unsuited
for
the
purpose
the
cause
of
popular
education
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
surely
entitled
to
the
same
consideration
at
the
hands
of
the
national
government
as
in
the
several
states
and
territories
to
which
munificent
grants
of
the
public
lands
have
been
made
for
the
endowment
of
schools
and
universities

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
our
heartfelt
gratitude
is
due
to
the
divine
being
who
holds
in
his
hands
the
destinies
of
nations
for
the
continued
bestowal
during
the
last
year
of
countless
blessings
upon
our
country
we
are
at
peace
with
all
other
nations
our
public
credit
has
greatly
improved
and
is
perhaps
now
stronger
than
ever
before
abundant
harvests
have
rewarded
the
labors
of
those
who
till
the
soil
our
manufacturing
industries
are
reviving
and
it
is
believed
that
general
prosperity
which
has
been
so
long
anxiously
looked
for
is
at
last
within
our
reach
the
enjoyment
of
health
by
our
people
generally
has
however
been
interrupted
during
the
past
season
by
the
prevalence
of
a
fatal
pestilence
the
yellow
fever
in
some
portions
of
the
southern
states
creating
an
emergency
which
called
for
prompt
and
extraordinary
measures
of
relief
the
disease
appeared
as
an
epidemic
at
new
orleans
and
at
other
places
on
the
lower
mississippi
soon
after
midsummer
it
was
rapidly
spread
by
fugitives
from
the
infected
cities
and
towns
and
did
not
disappear
until
early
in
november
the
states
of
louisiana
mississippi
and
tennessee
have
suffered
severely
about
cases
are
believed
to
have
occurred
of
which
about
according
to
intelligent
estimates
proved
fatal
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
with
any
approach
to
accuracy
the
loss
to
the
country
occasioned
by
this
epidemic
it
is
to
be
reckoned
by
the
hundred
millions
of
dollars
the
suffering
and
destitution
that
resulted
excited
the
deepest
sympathy
in
all
parts
of
the
union
physicians
and
nurses
hastened
from
every
quarter
to
the
assistance
of
the
afflicted
communities
voluntary
contributions
of
money
and
supplies
in
every
needed
form
were
speedily
and
generously
furnished
the
government
was
able
to
respond
in
some
measure
to
the
call
for
help
by
providing
tents
medicines
and
food
for
the
sick
and
destitute
the
requisite
directions
for
the
purpose
being
given
in
the
confident
expectation
that
this
action
of
the
executive
would
receive
the
sanction
of
congress
about
tents
and
rations
of
the
value
of
about
were
sent
to
cities
andtowns
which
applied
for
them
full
details
of
which
will
be
furnished
to
congress
by
the
proper
department
the
fearful
spread
of
this
pestilence
has
awakened
a
very
general
public
sentiment
in
favor
of
national
sanitary
administration
which
shall
not
only
control
quarantine
but
have
the
sanitary
supervision
of
internal
commerce
in
times
of
epidemics
and
hold
an
advisory
relation
to
the
state
and
municipal
health
authorities
with
power
to
deal
with
whatever
endangers
the
public
health
and
which
the
municipal
and
state
authorities
are
unable
to
regulate
the
national
quarantine
act
approved
april
which
was
passed
too
late
in
the
last
session
of
congress
to
provide
the
means
for
carrying
it
into
practical
operation
during
the
past
season
is
a
step
in
the
direction
here
indicated
in
view
of
the
necessity
for
the
most
effective
measures
by
quarantine
and
otherwise
for
the
protection
of
our
seaports
and
the
country
generally
from
this
and
other
epidemics
it
is
recommended
that
congress
give
to
the
whole
subject
early
and
careful
consideration
the
permanent
pacification
of
the
country
by
the
complete
protection
of
all
citizens
in
every
civil
and
political
right
continues
to
be
of
paramount
interest
with
the
great
body
of
our
people
every
step
in
this
direction
is
welcomed
with
public
approval
and
every
interruption
of
steady
and
uniform
progress
to
the
desired
consummation
awakens
general
uneasiness
and
widespread
condemnation
the
recent
congressional
elections
have
furnished
a
direct
and
trustworthy
test
of
the
advance
thus
far
made
in
the
practical
establishment
of
the
right
of
suffrage
secured
by
the
constitution
to
the
liberated
race
in
the
southern
states
all
disturbing
influences
real
or
imaginary
had
been
removed
from
all
of
these
states
the
three
constitutional
amendments
which
conferred
freedom
and
equality
of
civil
and
political
rights
upon
the
colored
people
of
the
south
were
adopted
by
the
concurrent
action
of
the
great
body
of
good
citizens
who
maintained
the
authority
of
the
national
government
and
the
integrity
and
perpetuity
of
the
union
at
such
a
cost
of
treasure
and
life
as
a
wise
and
necessary
embodiment
in
the
organic
law
of
the
just
results
of
the
war
the
people
of
the
former
slaveholding
states
accepted
these
results
and
gave
in
every
practicable
form
assurances
that
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
laws
passed
in
pursuance
thereof
should
in
good
faith
be
enforced
rigidly
and
impartially
in
letter
and
spirit
to
the
end
that
the
humblest
citizen
without
distinction
of
race
or
color
should
under
them
receive
full
and
equal
protection
in
person
and
property
and
in
political
rights
and
privileges
by
these
constitutional
amendments
the
southern
section
of
the
union
obtained
a
large
increase
of
political
power
in
congress
and
in
the
electoral
college
and
the
country
justly
expected
that
elections
would
proceed
as
to
the
enfranchised
race
upon
the
same
circumstances
of
legal
and
constitutional
freedom
and
protection
which
obtained
in
all
the
other
states
of
the
union
the
friends
of
law
and
order
looked
forward
to
the
conduct
of
these
elections
as
offering
to
the
general
judgment
of
the
country
an
important
opportunity
to
measure
the
degree
in
which
the
right
of
suffrage
could
be
exercised
by
the
colored
people
and
would
be
respected
by
their
fellowcitizens
but
a
more
general
enjoyment
of
freedom
of
suffrage
by
the
colored
people
and
a
more
just
and
generous
protection
of
that
freedom
by
the
communities
of
which
they
form
a
part
were
generally
anticipated
than
the
record
of
the
elections
discloses
in
some
of
those
states
in
which
the
colored
people
have
been
unable
to
make
their
opinions
felt
in
the
elections
the
result
is
mainly
due
to
influences
not
easily
measured
or
remedied
by
legal
protection
but
in
the
states
of
louisiana
and
south
carolina
at
large
and
in
some
particular
congressional
districts
outside
of
those
states
the
records
of
the
elections
seem
to
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
rights
of
the
colored
voters
have
been
overridden
and
their
participation
in
the
elections
not
permitted
to
be
either
general
or
free
it
will
be
for
the
congress
for
which
these
elections
were
held
to
make
such
examinations
into
their
conduct
as
may
be
appropriate
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
claims
of
members
to
their
seats
in
the
meanwhile
it
becomes
the
duty
of
the
executive
and
judicial
departments
of
the
government
each
in
its
province
to
inquire
into
and
punish
violations
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
have
occurred
i
can
but
repeat
what
i
said
in
this
connection
in
my
last
message
that
whatever
authority
rests
with
me
to
this
end
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
put
forth
and
i
am
unwilling
to
forego
a
renewed
appeal
to
the
legislatures
the
courts
the
executive
authorities
and
the
people
of
the
states
where
these
wrongs
have
been
perpetrated
to
give
their
assistance
toward
bringing
to
justice
the
offenders
and
preventing
a
repetition
of
the
crimes
no
means
within
my
power
will
be
spared
to
obtain
a
full
and
fair
investigation
of
the
alleged
crimes
and
to
secure
the
conviction
and
just
punishment
of
the
guilty
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
principal
appropriation
made
for
the
department
of
justice
at
the
last
session
contained
the
following
clause
and
for
defraying
the
expenses
which
may
be
incurred
in
the
enforcement
of
the
act
approved
february
entitled
an
act
to
amend
an
act
approved
may
entitled
an
act
to
enforce
the
rights
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
vote
in
the
several
states
of
this
union
and
for
other
purposes
or
any
acts
amendatory
thereof
or
supplementary
thereto
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
attorneygeneral
that
the
expenses
of
these
proceedings
will
largely
exceed
the
amount
which
was
thus
provided
and
i
rely
confidently
upon
congress
to
make
adequate
appropriations
to
enable
the
executive
department
to
enforce
the
laws
i
respectfully
urge
upon
your
attention
that
the
congressional
elections
in
every
district
in
a
very
important
sense
are
justly
a
matter
of
political
interest
and
concern
throughout
the
whole
country
each
state
every
political
party
is
entitled
to
the
share
of
power
which
is
conferred
by
the
legal
and
constitutional
suffrage
it
is
the
right
of
every
citizen
possessing
the
qualifications
prescribed
by
law
to
east
one
unintimidated
ballot
and
to
have
his
ballot
honestly
counted
so
long
as
the
exercise
of
this
power
and
the
enjoyment
of
this
right
are
common
and
equal
practically
as
well
as
formally
submission
to
the
results
of
the
suffrage
will
be
accorded
loyally
and
cheerfully
and
all
the
departments
of
government
will
feel
the
true
vigor
of
the
popular
will
thus
expressed
no
temporary
or
administrative
interests
of
government
however
urgent
or
weighty
will
ever
displace
the
zeal
of
our
people
in
defense
of
the
primary
rights
of
citizenship
they
understand
that
the
protection
of
liberty
requires
the
maintenance
in
full
vigor
of
the
manly
methods
of
free
speech
free
press
and
free
suffrage
and
will
sustain
the
full
authority
of
government
to
enforce
the
laws
which
are
framed
to
preserve
these
inestimable
rights
the
material
progress
and
welfare
of
the
states
depend
on
the
protection
afforded
to
their
citizens
there
can
be
no
peace
without
such
protection
no
prosperity
without
peace
and
the
whole
country
is
deeply
interested
in
the
growth
and
prosperity
of
all
its
parts
while
the
country
has
not
yet
reached
complete
unity
of
feeling
and
reciprocal
confidence
between
the
communities
so
lately
and
so
seriously
estranged
i
feel
an
absolute
assurance
that
the
tendencies
are
in
that
direction
and
with
increasing
force
the
power
of
public
opinion
will
override
all
political
prejudices
and
all
sectional
or
state
attachments
in
demanding
that
all
over
our
wide
territory
the
name
and
character
of
citizen
of
the
united
states
shall
mean
one
and
the
same
thing
and
carry
with
them
unchallenged

security
and
respect
our
relations
with
other
countries
continue
peaceful
our
neutrality
in
contests
between
foreign
powers
has
been
maintained
and
respected
the
universal
exposition
held
at
paris
during
the
past
summer
has
been
attended
by
large
numbers
of
our
citizens
the
brief
period
allowed
for
the
preparation
and
arrangement
of
the
contributions
of
our
citizens
to
this
great
exposition
was
well
employed
in
energetic
and
judicious
efforts
to
overcome
this
disadvantage
these
efforts
led
and
directed
by
the
commissionergeneral
were
remarkably
successful
and
the
exhibition
of
the
products
of
american
industry
was
creditable
and
gratifying
in
scope
and
character
the
reports
of
the
united
states
commissioners
giving
its
results
in
detail
will
be
duly
laid
before
you
our
participation
in
this
international
competition
for
the
favor
and
the
trade
of
the
world
may
be
expected
to
produce
useful
and
important
resultsin
promoting

in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
of

three
commissioners
were
appointed
to
an
international
conference
on
the
subject
of
adopting
a
common
ratio
between
gold
and
silver
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
internationally
the
use
of
bimetallic
money
and
securing
fixity
of
relative
value
between
those
metals
invitations
were
addressed
to
the
various
governments
which
had
expressed
a
willingness
to
participate
in
its
deliberations
the
conference
held
its
meetings
in
paris
in
august
last
the
report
of
the
commissioners
herewith
submitted
will
show
its
results
no
common
ratio
between
gold
and
silver
could
be
agreed
upon
by
the
conference
the
general
conclusion
was
reached
that
it
is
necessary
to
maintain
in
the
world
the
monetary
functions
of
silver
as
well
as
of
gold
leaving
the
selection
of
the
use
of
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
metals
or
of
both
to
be
made
by
each
state

having
appropriated
at
its
last
session
the
sum
of
to

joint
commission
at

question
thereby
submitted
to

the
president
shall
deem
it
his
duty
to
make

communications
upon
these
points
were
addressed
to
the
british
government
through
the
legation
of
the
united
states
at
london
failing
to
obtain
the
concurrence
of
the
british
government
in
the
views
of
this
government
respecting
the
award
i
have
deemed
it
my
duty
to
tender
the
sum
named
within
the
year
fixed
by
the
treaty
accompanied
by
a
notice
of
the
grounds
of
the
payment
and
a
protest
against
any
other
construction
of
the
same
the
correspondence
upon
this
subject
will
be
laid
before
you
the
spanish
government
has
officially
announced
the
termination
of
the
insurrection
in
cuba
and
the
restoration
of
peace
throughout
that
island
confident
expectations
are
expressed
of
a
revival
of
trade
and
prosperity
which
it
is
earnestly
hoped
may
prove
well
rounded
numerous
claims
of
american
citizens
for
relief
for
injuries
or
restoration
of
property
have
been
among
the
incidents
of
the
longcontinued
hostilities
some
of
these
claims
are
in
process
of
adjustment
by
spain
and
the
others
are
promised
early
and
careful
consideration
the
treaty
made
with
italy
in
regard
to
reciprocal
consular
privileges
has
been
duly
ratified
and
proclaimed
no
questions
of
grave
importance
have
arisen
with
any
other
of
the
european
powers
the
japanese
government
has
been
desirous
of
a
revision
of
such
parts
of
its
treaties
with
foreign
powers
as
relate
to
commerce
and
it
is
understood
has
addressed
to
each
of
the
treaty
powers
a
request
to
open
negotiations
with
that
view
the
united
states
government
has
been
inclined
to
regard
the
matter
favorably
whatever
restrictions
upon
trade
with
japan
are
found
injurious
to
that
people
can
not
but
affect
injuriously
nations
holding
commercial
intercourse
with
them
japan
after
a
long
period
of
seclusion
has
within
the
past
few
years
made
rapid
strides
in
the
path
of
enlightenment
and
progress
and
not
unreasonably
is
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
her
relations
with
the
nations
of
europe
and
america
shall
be
assimilated
to
those
which
they
hold
with
each
other
a
treaty
looking
to
this
end
has
been
made
which
will
be
submitted
for
the
consideration
of
the
senate
after
an
interval
of
several
years
the
chinese
government
has
again
sent
envoys
to
the
united
states
they
have
been
received
and
a
permanent
legation
is
now
established
here
by
that
government
it
is
not
doubted
that
this
step
will
be
of
advantage
to
both
nations
in
promoting
friendly
relations
and
removing
causes
of
difference
the
treaty
with
the
samoan
islands
having
been
duly
ratified
and
accepted
on
the
part
of
both
governments
is
now
in
operation
and
a
survey
and
soundings
of
the
harbor
of
pagopago
have
been
made

at
one

endanger

while
no

much
has
been

diminish
them
the
effective
force
of

troops
on
the
rio
grande
by
a
strict
and
faithful
compliance
with
instructions
has
done
much
to
remove
the
sources
of
dispute
and
it
is
now
understood
that
a
like
force
of
mexican
troops
on
the
other
side
of
the

is
also
making
an
energetic
movement
against

this

looks
with
the

satisfaction

upon

to
restrain

violations
of

it
is
proposed
to
hold
next

an
international
exhibition
in

and
it
is
believed
that
the
display
of
the
agricultural
and
manufacturing

of
the
two
nations
will
tend
to
better

and
increased

some

a

about

the
reports
of
diplomatic

consular
officers
in
relation
to
the
development
of
our
foreign
commerce
have
furnished
many
facts
that
have

have
stimulated
to

exertion
the
enterprise

the
report

statement
of

in
the
foregoing
statements
of

actual
and
estimated
no
amount
is
allowed
for
the
sinking
fund
provided
for
by
the
act
approved
february
which
requires
that
per
cent
of
the
entire
debt
of
the
united
states
shall
be
purchased
or
paid
within
each
fiscal
year
to
be
set
apart
as
a
sinking
fund
there
has
been
however
a
substantial
compliance
with
the
conditions
of
the
law
by
its
terms
the
public
debt
should
have
been
reduced
between
and
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
the
actual
reduction
of
the
ascertained
debt
in
that
period
has
been
being
in
excess
of
the
reduction
required
by
the
sinking
fund
act
the
amount
of
the
public
debt
less
cash
in
the
treasury
november
was
a
reduction
since
the
same
date
last
year
of
the
progress
made
during
the
last
year
in
refunding
the
public
debt
at
lower
rates
of
interest
is
very
gratifying
the
amount
of
per
cent
bonds
sold
during
the
present
year
prior
to
november
is
and
per
cent
bonds
commonly
known
as
fivetwenties
to
an
equal
amount
have
been
or
will
be
redeemed
as
calls
mature
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
department
to
place
the
per
cent
bonds
within
easy
reach
of
every
citizen
who
desires
to
invest
his
savings
whether
small
or
great
in
these
securities
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
recommends
that
the
law
be
so
modified
that
small
sums
may
be
invested
and
that
through
the
postoffices
or
other
agents
of
the
government
the
freest
opportunity
may
be
given
in
al
l
parts
of
the
country
for
such
investments
the
best
mode
suggested
is
that
the
department
be
authorized
to
issue
certificates
of
deposit
of
the
denomination
of
bearing
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
per
annum
and
convertible
at
any
time
within
one
year
after
their
issue
into
the
per
cent
bonds
authorized
by
the
refunding
act
and
to
be
issued
only
in
exchange
for
united
states
notes
sent
to
the
treasury
by
mail
or
otherwise
such
a
provision
of
law
supported
by
suitable
regulations
would
enable
any
person
readily
without
cost
or
risk
to
convert
his
money
into
an
interestbearing
security
of
the
united
states
and
the
money
so
received
could
be
applied
to
the
redemption
of
per
cent
bonds
the
coinage
of
gold
during
the
last
fiscal
year
was
the
coinage
of
silver
dollars
under
the
act
passed
february
amounted
on
the
d
of
november
to
of
which
amount
are
in
circulation
and
the
balance
is
still
in
the
possession
of
the
government
with
views
unchanged
with
regard
to
the
act
under
which
the
coinage
of
silver
proceeds
it
has
been
the
purpose
of
the
secretary
faithfully
to
execute
the
law
and
to
afford
a
fair
trial
to
the
measure
in
the
present
financial
condition
of
the
country
i
am
persuaded
that
the
welfare
of
legitimate
business
and
industry
of
every
description
will
be
best
promoted
by
abstaining
from
all
attempts
to
make
radical
changes
in
the
existing
financial
legislation
let
it
be
understood
that
during
the
coming
year
the
business
of
the
country
will
be
undisturbed
by
governmental
interference
with
the
laws
affecting
it
and
we
may
confidently
expect
that
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
which
will
take
place
at
the
appointed
time
will
be
successfully
and
easily
maintained
and
that
it
will
be
followed
by
a
healthful
and
enduring
revival
of
business
prosperity
let
the
healing
influence
of
time
the
inherent
energies
of
our
people
and
the
boundless
resources
of
our
country
have
a
fair
opportunity
and
relief
from
present
difficulties
will
surely
follow
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
shows
that
the
army
has
been
well
and
economically
supplied
that
our
small
force
has
been
actively
employed
and
has
faithfully
performed
all
the
service
required
of
it
the
morale
of
the
army
has
improved
and
the
number
of
desertions
has
materially
decreased
during
the
year
the
secretary
recommends
that
a
pension
be
granted
to
the
widow
of
the
late
lieutenant
henry
h
benner
eighteenth
infantry
who
lost
his
life
by

otherwise
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
laws
except
in
such
cases
and
under
such
circumstances
as
such
employment
of
said
force
may
be
expressly
authorized
by
the
constitution

by
act

passage
of

legalizing
the

be
made
for
the
erection
of
a
fireproof
building
for
the
preservation
of
certain
valuable
records
now
constantly
exposed
to
destruction
by
fire
these
recommendations
are
all
commended
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
that
the
navy
has
improved
during
the
last
fiscal
year
work
has
been
done
on
seventyfive
vessels
ten
of
which
have
been
thoroughly
repaired
and
made
ready
for

two
others
are
in
rapid
progress
toward
completion
the
total
expenditures
of
the
year
including
the
amount
appropriated
for
the
deficiencies
of
the
previous
year
were
the
actual
expenses
chargeable
to
the
year
exclusive
of
these
deficiencies
were
or
less
than
those
of
the
previous
year
and
less
than
the
expenses
including
the
deficiencies
the
estimates
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
exceeding
the
appropriations
of
the
present
year
only
which
excess
is
occasioned
by
the
demands
of
the
naval
academy
and
the
marine
corps
as
explained
in
the
secretarys
report
the
appropriations
for
the
present
fiscal
year
are
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
will
be
ample
for
all
the
current
expenses
of
the
department
during
the
year
the
amount
drawn
from
the
treasury
from
july
to
november
is
of
which
has
been
refunded
leaving
as
the
expenditure
for
that
period
or
less
than
the
corresponding
period
of
the
last
fiscal
year
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
embraces
a
detailed
statement
of
the
operations
of
the
postoffice
department
the
expenditures
of
that
department
for
the
fiscal

ended

were
the

including
sales
of

moneyorder
business
and
official
stamps
were
the
sum
of
included
in
the
foregoing
statement
of
expenditures
is
chargeable
to
preceding
years
so
that
the
actual
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
are
the
amount
drawn
from
the
treasury
on
appropriations
in
addition
to
the
revenues
of
the
department
was
the
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ending

are
estimated
at
and
the
receipts
from
all
sources
at
leaving
a
deficiency
to
be
appropriated
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
report
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
compensation
of
postmasters
and
of
railroads
for
carrying
the
mail
is
regulated
by
law
and
that
the
failure
of
congress
to
appropriate
the
amounts
required
for
these
purposes
does
not
relieve
the
government
of
responsibility
but
necessarily
increases
the
deficiency
bills
which
congress
will
be
called
upon
to
pass
in
providing
for
the
postal
service
the
following
questions
are
presented
should
congress
annually
appropriate
a
sum
for
its
expenses
largely
in
excess
of
its
revenues
or
should
such
rates
of
postage
be
established
as
will
make
the
department
selfsustaining
should
the
postal
service
be
reduced
by
excluding
from
the
mails
matter
which
does
not
pay
its
way
should
the
number
of
post
routes
be
diminished
should
other
methods
be
adopted
which
will
increase
the
revenues
or
diminish
the
expenses
of
the
postal
service
the
international
postal
congress
which
met
at
paris
may
and
continued
in
session
until
june
of
the
same
year
was
composed
of
delegates
from
nearly
all
the
civilized
countries
of
the
world
it
adopted
a
new
convention
to
take
the
place
of
the
treaty
concluded
at
berne
october
which
goes
into
effect
on
the
st
of
april
between
the
countries
whose
delegates
have
signed
it
it
was
ratified
and
approved
by
and
with
the
consent
of
the
president
august
a
synopsis
of
this
universal
postal
convention
will
be
found
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
and
the
full
text
in
the
appendix
thereto
in
its
origin
the
postal
union
comprised
twentythree
countries
having
a
population
of
people
on
the
st
of
april
next
it
will
comprise
fortythree
countries
and
colonies
with
a
population
of
more
than
people
and
will
soon
by
the
accession
of
the
few
remaining
countries
and
colonies
which
maintain
organized
postal
services
constitute
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
as
its
new
title
indicates
a
universal
union
regulating
upon
a
uniform
basis
of
cheap
postage
rates
the
postal
intercourse
between
all
civilized
nations
some
embarrassment
has
arisen
out
of
the
conflict
between
the
customs
laws
of
this
country
and
the
provisions
of
the
postal
convention
in
regard
to
the
transmission
of
foreign
books
and
newspapers
to
this
country
by
mail
it
is
hoped
that
congress
will
be
able
to
devise
some
means
of
reconciling
the
difficulties
which
have
thus
been
created
so
as
to
do
justice
to
all
parties
involved
the
business
of
the
supreme
court
and
of
the
courts
in
many
of
the
circuits
has
increased
to
such
an
extent
during
the
past
year
that
additional
legislation
is
imperative
to
relieve
and
prevent
the
delay
of
justice
and
possible
oppression
to
suitors
which
is
thus
occasioned
the
encumbered
condition
of
these
dockets
is
presented
anew
in
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
and
the
remedy
suggested
is
earnestly
urged
for
congressional
action
the
creation
of
additional
circuit
judges
as
proposed
would
afford
a
complete
remedy
and
would
involve
an
expense
at
the
present
rate
of
salaries
of
not
more
than
a
year
the
annual
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
present
an
elaborate
account
of
the
present
condition
of
the
indian
tribes
and
of
that
branch
of
the
public
service
which
ministers
to
their
interests
while
the
conduct
of
the
indians
generally
has
been
orderly
and
their
relations
with
their
neighbors
friendly
and
peaceable
two
local
disturbances
have
occurred
which
were
deplorable
in
their
character
but
remained
happily
confined
to
a
comparatively
small
number
of
indians
the
discontent
among
the
bannocks
which
led
first
to
some
acts
of
violence
on
the
part
of
some
members
of
the
tribe
and
finally
to
the
outbreak
appears
to
have
been
caused
by
an
insufficiency
of
food
on
the
reservation
and
this
insufficiency
to
have
been
owing
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
appropriations
made
by
congress
to
the
wants
of
the
indians
at
a
time
when
the
indians
were
prevented
from
supplying
the
deficiency
by
hunting
after
an
arduous
pursuit
by
the
troops
of
the
united
states
and
several
engagements
the
hostile
indians
were
reduced
to
subjection
and
the
larger
part
of
them
surrendered
themselves
as
prisoners
in
this
connection
i
desire
to
call
attention
to
the
recommendation
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
a
sufficient
fund
be
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
executive
to
be
used
with
proper
accountability
at
discretion
in
sudden
emergencies
of
the
indian
service
the
other
case
of
disturbance
was
that
of
a
band
of
northern
cheyen
nes
who
suddenly
left
their
reservation
in
the
indian
territory
and
marched
rapidly
through
the
states
of
kansas
and
nebraska
in
the
direction
of
their
old
hunting
grounds
committing
murders
and
other
crimes
on
their
way
from
documents
accompanying
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
it
appears
that
this
disorderly
band
was
as
fully
supplied
with
the
necessaries
of
life
as
the
other
indians
who
remained
quietly
on
the
reservation
and
that
the
disturbance
was
caused
by
men
of
a
restless
and
mischievous
disposition
among
the
indians
themselves
almost
the
whole
of
this
band
have
surrendered
to
the
military
authorities
and
it
is
a
gratifying
fact
that
when
some
of
them
had
taken
refuge
in
the
camp
of
the
red
cloud
sioux
with
whom
they
had
been
in
friendly
relations
the
sioux
held
them
as
prisoners
and
readily
gave
them
up
to
the
officers
of
the
united
states
thus
giving
new
proof
of
the
loyal
spirit
which
alarming
rumors
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
they
have
uniformly
shown
ever
since
the
wishes
they
expressed
at
the
council
of
september
had
been
complied
with
both
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
secretary
of
war
unite
in
the
recommendation
that
provision
be
made
by
congress
for
the
organization
of
a
corps
of
mounted
indian
auxiliaries
to
be
under
the
control
of
the
army
and
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
indians
on
their
reservations
and
preventing
or
repressing
disturbance
on
their
part
i
earnestly
concur
in
this
recommendation
it
is
believed
that
the
organization
of
such
a
body
of
indian
cavalry
receiving
a
moderate
pay
from
the
government
would
considerably
weaken
the
restless
element
among
the
indians
by
withdrawing
from
it
a
number
of
young
men
and
giving
them
congenial
employment
under
the
government
it
being
a
matter
of
experience
that
indians
in
our
service
almost
without
exception
are
faithful
in
the
performance
of
the
duties
assigned
to
them
such
an
organization
would
materially
aid
the
army
in
the
accomplishment
of
a
task
for
which
its
numerical
strength
is
sometimes
found
insufficient
but
while
the
employment
of
force
for
the
prevention
or
repression
of
indian
troubles
is
of
occasional
necessity
and
wise
preparation
should
be
made
to
that
end
greater
reliance
must
be
placed
on
humane
and
civilizing
agencies
for
the
ultimate
solution
of
what
is
called
the
indian
problem
it
may
be
very
difficult
and
require
much
patient
effort
to
curb
the
unruly
spirit
of
the
savage
indian
to
the
restraints
of
civilized
life
but
experience
shows
that
it
is
not
impossible
many
of
the
tribes
which
are
now
quiet
and
orderly
and
selfsupporting
were
once
as
savage
as
any
that
at
present
roam
over
the
plains
or
in
the
mountains
of
the
far
west
and
were
then
considered
inaccessible
to
civilizing
influences
it
may
be
impossible
to
raise
them
fully
up
to
the
level
of
the
white
population
of
the
united
states
but
we
should
not
forget
that
they
are
the
aborigines
of
the
country
and
called
the
soil
their
own
on
which
our
people
have
grown
rich
powerful
and
happy
we
owe
it
to
them
as
a
moral
duty
to
help
them
in
attaining
at
least
that
degree
of
civilization
which
they
may
be
able
to
reach
it
is
not
only
our
duty
it
is
also
our
interest
to
do
so
indians
who
have
become
agriculturists
or
herdsmen
and
feel
an
interest
in
property
will
thenceforth
cease
to
be
a
warlike
and
disturbing
element
it
is
also
a
wellauthenticated
fact
that
indians
are
apt
to
be
peaceable
and
quiet
when
their
children
are
at
school
and
i
am
gratified
to
know
from
the
expressions
of
indians
themselves
and
from
many
concurring
reports
that
there
is
a
steadily
increasing
desire
even
among
indians
belonging
to
comparatively
wild
tribes
to
have
their
children
educated
i
invite
attention
to
the
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
touching
the
experiment
recently
inaugurated
in
taking
fifty
indian
children
boys
and
girls
from
different
tribes
to
the
hampton
normal
agricultural
institute
in
virginia
where
they
are
to
receive
an
elementary
english
education
and
training
in
agriculture
and
other
useful
works
to
be
returned
to
their
tribes
after
the
completed
course
as
interpreters
instructors
and
examples
it
is
reported
that
the
officer
charged
with
the
selection
of
those
children
might
have
had
thousands
of
young
indians
sent
with
him
had
it
been
possible
to
make
provision
for
them
i
agree
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
saying
that
the
result
of
this
interesting
experiment
if
favorable
may
be
destined
to
become
an
important
factor
in
the
advancement
of
civilization
among
the
indians
the
question
whether
a
change
in
the
control
of
the
indian
service
should
be
made
was
at
the
last
session
of
congress
referred
to
a
committee
for
inquiry
and
report
without
desiring
to
anticipate
that
report
i
venture
to
express
the
hope
that
in
the
decision
of
so
important
a
question
the
views
expressed
above
may
not
be
lost
sight
of
and
that
the
decision
whatever
it
may
be
will
arrest
further
agitation
of
this
subject
such
agitation
being
apt
to
produce
a
disturbing
effect
upon
the
service
as
well
as
on
the
indians
themselves
in
the
enrollment
of
the
bill
making
appropriations
for
sundry
civil
expenses
at
the
last
session
of
congress
that
portion
which
provided
for
the
continuation
of
the
hot
springs
commission
was
omitted
as
the
commission
had
completed
the
work
of
taking
testimony
on
the
many
conflicting
claims
the
suspension
of
their
labors
before
determining
the
rights
of
claimants
threatened
for
a
time
to
embarrass
the
interests
not
only
of
the
government
but
also
of
a
large
number
of
the
citizens
of
hot
springs
who
were
waiting
for
final
action
on
their
claims
before
beginning
contemplated
improvements
in
order
to
prevent
serious
difficulties
which
were
apprehended
and
at
the
solicitation
of
many
leading
citizens
of
hot
springs
and
others
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
town
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
authorized
to
request
the
late
commissioners
to
take
charge
of
the
records
of
their
proceedings
and
to
perform
such
work
as
could
properly
be
done
by
them
under
such
circumstances
to
facilitate
the
future
adjudication
of
the
claims
at
an
early
day
and
to
preserve
the
status
of
the
claimants
until
their
rights
should
be
finally
determined
the
late
commissioners
complied
with
that
request
and
report
that
the
testimony
in
all
the
cases
has
been
written
out
examined
briefed
and
so
arranged
as
to
facilitate
an
early
settlement
when
authorized
by
law
it
is
recommended
that
the
requisite
authority
be
given
at
as
early
a
day
in
the
session
as
possible
and
that
a
fair
compensation
be
allowed
the
late
commissioners
for
the
expense
incurred
and
the
labor
performed
by
them
since
the
th
of
june
last
i
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
recommendations
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
with
regard
to
the
preservation
of
the
timber
on
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states
the
protection
of
the
public
property
is
one
of
the
first
duties
of
the
government
the
department
of
the
interior
should
therefore
be
enabled
by
sufficient
appropriations
to
enforce
the
laws
in
that
respect
but
this
matter
appears
still
more
important
as
a
question
of
public
economy
the
rapid
destruction
of
our
forests
is
an
evil
fraught
with
the
gravest
consequences
especially
in
the
mountainous
districts
where
the
rocky
slopes
once
denuded
of
their
trees
will
remain
so
forever
there
the
injury
once
done
can
not
be
repaired
i
fully
concur
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
opinion
that
for
this
reason
legislation
touching
the
public
timber
in
the
mountainous
states
and
territories
of
the
west
should
be
especially
well
considered
and
that
existing
laws
in
which
the
destruction
of
the
forests
is
not
sufficiently
guarded
against
should
be
speedily
modified
a
general
law
concerning
this
important
subject
appears
to
me
to
be
a
matter
of
urgent
public
necessity
from
the
organization
of
the
government
the
importance
of
encouraging
by
all
possible
means
the
increase
of
our
agricultural
productions
has
been
acknowledged
and
urged
upon
the
attention
of
congress
and
the
people
as
the
surest
and
readiest
means
of
increasing
our
substantial
and
enduring
prosperity
the
words
of
washington
are
as
applicable
today
as
when
in
his
eighth
annual
message
he
said
it
will
not
be
doubted
that
with
reference
either
to
individual
or
national
welfare
agriculture
is
of
primary
importance
in
proportion
as
nations
advance
in
population
and
other
circumstances
of
maturity
this
truth
becomes
more
apparent
and
renders
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
more
and
more
an
object
of
public
patronage
institutions
for
promoting
it
grow
up
supported
by
the
public
purse
and
to
what
object
can
it
be
dedicated
with
greater
propriety
among
the
means
which
have
been
employed
to
this
end
none
have
been
attended
with
greater
success
than
the
establishment
of
boards
composed
of
proper
characters
charged
with
collecting
and
diffusing
information
and
enabled
by
premiums
and
small
pecuniary
aids
to
encourage
and
assist
a
spirit
of
discovery
and
improvement
this
species
of
establishment
contributes
doubly
to
the
increase
of
improvement
by
stimulating
to
enterprise
and
experiment
and
by
drawing
to
a
common
center
the
results
everywhere
of
individual
skill
and
observation
and
spreading
them
thence
over
the
whole
nation
experience
accordingly
hath
shewn
that
they
are
very
cheap
instruments
of
immense
national
benefits
the
preponderance
of
the
agricultural
over
any
other
interest
in
the
united
states
entitles
it
to
all
the
consideration
claimed
for
it
by
washington
about
onehalf
of
the
population
of
the
united
states
is
engaged
in
agriculture
the
value
of
the
agricultural
products
of
the
united
states
for
the
year
is
estimated
at
the
exports
of
agricultural
products
for
the
year
as
appears
from
the
report
of
the
bureau
of
statistics
were
the
great
extent
of
our
country
with
its
diversity
of
soil
and
climate
enables
us
to
produce
within
our
own
borders
and
by
our
own
labor
not
only
the
nece
ssaries
but
most
of
the
luxuries
that
are
consumed
in
civilized
countries
yet
notwithstanding
our
advantages
of
soil
climate
and
intercommunication
it
appears
from
the
statistical
statements
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
that
we
import
annually
from
foreign
lands
many
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
agricultural
products
which
could
be
raised
in
our
own
country
numerous
questions
arise
in
the
practice
of
advanced
agriculture
which
can
only
be
answered
by
experiments
often
costly
and
sometimes
fruitless
which
are
beyond
the
means
of
private
individuals
and
are
a
just
and
proper
charge
on
the
whole
nation
for
the
benefit
of
the
nation
it
is
good
policy
especially
in
times
of
depression
and
uncertainty
in
other
business
pursuits
with
a
vast
area
of
uncultivated
and
hence
unproductive
territory
wisely
opened
to
homestead
settlement
to
encourage
by
every
proper
and
legitimate
means
the
occupation
and
tillage
of
the
soil
the
efforts
of
the
department
of
agriculture
to
stimulate
old
and
introduce
new
agricultural
industries
to
improve
the
quality
and
increase
the
quantity
of
our
products
to
determine
the
value
of
old
or
establish
the
importance
of
new
methods
of
culture
are
worthy
of
your
careful
and
favorable
consideration
and
assistance
by
such
appropriations
of
money
and
enlargement
of
facilities
as
may
seem
to
be
demanded
by
the
present
favorable
conditions
for
the
growth
and
rapid
development
of
this
important
interest
the
abuse
of
animals
in
transit
is
widely
attracting
public
attention
a
national
convention
of
societies
specially
interested
in
the
subject
has
recently
met
at
baltimore
and
the
facts
developed
both
in
regard
to
cruelties
to
animals
and
the
effect
of
such
cruelties
upon
the
public
health
would
seem
to
demand
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
and
the
enactment
of
more
efficient
laws
for
the
prevention
of
these
abuses
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
the
bureau
of
education
shows
very
gratifying
progress
throughout
the
country
in
all
the
interests
committed
to
the
care
of
this
important
office
the
report
is
especially
encouraging
with
respect
to
the
extension
of
the
advantages
of
the
commonschool
system
in
sections
of
the
country
where
the
general
enjoyment
of
the
privilege
of
free
schools
is
not
yet
attained
to
education
more
than
to
any
other
agency
we
are
to
look
as
the
resource
for
the
advancement
of
the
people
in
the
requisite
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
their
rights
and
responsibilities
as
citizens
and
i
desire
to
repeat
the
suggestion
contained
in
my
former
message
in
behalf
of
the
enactment
of
appropriate
measures
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
supplementing
with
national
aid
the
local
systems
of
education
in
the
several
states
adequate
accommodations
for
the
great
library
which
is
overgrowing
the
capacity
of
the
rooms
now
occupied
at
the
capitol
should
be
provided
without
further
delay
this
invaluable
collection
of
books
manuscripts
and
illustrative
art
has
grown
to
such
proportions
in
connection
with
the
copyright
system
of
the
country
as
to
demand
the
prompt
and
careful
attention
of
congress
to
save
it
from
injury
in
its
present
crowded
and
insufficient
quarters
as
this
library
is
national
in
its
character
and
must
from
the
nature
of
the
case
increase
even
more
rapidly
in
the
future
than
in
the
past
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
people
will
sanction
any
wise
expenditure
to
preserve
it
and
to
enlarge
its
usefulness
the
appeal
of
the
regents
of
the
smithsonian
institution
for
the
means
to
organize
exhibit
and
make
available
for
the
public
benefit
the
articles
now
stored
away
belonging
to
the
national
museum
i
heartily
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
attention
of
congress
is
again
invited
to
the
condition
of
the
river
front
of
the
city
of
washington
it
is
a
matter
of
vital
importance
to
the
health
of
the
residents
of
the
national
capital
both
temporary
and
permanent
that
the
lowlands
in
front
of
the
city
now
subject
to
tidal
overflow
should
be
reclaimed
in
their
present
condition
these
flats
obstruct
the
drainage
of
the
city
and
are
a
dangerous
source
of
malarial
poison
the
reclamation
will
improve
the
navigation
of
the
river
by
restricting
and
consequently
deepening
its
channel
and
is
also
of
importance
when
considered
in
connection
with
the
extension
of
the
public
ground
and
the
enlargement
of
the
park
west
and
south
of
the
washington
monument
the
report
of
the
board
of
survey
heretofore
ordered
by
act
of
congress
on
the
improvement
of
the
harbor
of
washington
and
georgetown
is
respectfully
commended
to
consideration
the
report
of
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia
presents
a
detailed
statement
of
the
affairs
of
the
district
the
relative
expenditures
by
the
united
states
and
the
district
for
local
purposes
is
contrasted
showing
that
the
expenditures
by
the
people
of
the
district
greatly
exceed
those
of
the
general
government
the
exhibit
is
made
in
connection
with
estimates
for
the
requisite
repair
of
the
defective
pavements
and
sewers
of
the
city
which
is
a
work
of
immediate
necessity
and
in
the
same
connection
a
plan
is
presented
for
the
permanent
funding
of
the
outstanding
securities
of
the
district
the
benevolent
reformatory
and
penal
institutions
of
the
district
are
all
entitled
to
the
favorable
attention
of
congress
the
reform
school
needs
additional
buildings
and
teachers
appropriations
which
will
place
all
of
these
institutions
in
a
condition
to
become
models
of
usefulness
and
beneficence
will
be
regarded
by
the
country
as
liberality
wisely
bestowed
the
commissioners
with
evident
justice
request
attention
to
the
discrimination
made
by
congress
against
the
district
in
the
donation
of
land
for
the
support
of
the
public
schools
and
ask
that
the
same
liberality
that
has
been
shown
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
various
states
and
territories
of
the
united
states
may
be
extended
to
the
district
of
columbia
the
commissioners
also
invite
attention
to
the
damage
inflicted
upon
public
and
private
interests
by
the
present
location
of
the
depots
and
switching
tracks
of
the
several
railroads
entering
the
city
and
ask
for
legislation
looking
to
their
removal
the
recommendations
and
suggestions
contained
in
the
report
will
i
trust
receive
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
sufficient
time
has
perhaps
not
elapsed
since
the
reorganization
of
the
government
of
the
district
under
the
recent
legislation
of
congress
for
the
expression
of
a
confident
opinion
as
to
its
successful
operation
but
the
practical
results
already
attained
are
so
satisfactory
that
the
friends
of
the
new
government
may
well
urge
upon
congress
the
wisdom
of
its
continuance
without
essential
modification
until
by
actual
experience
its
advantages
and
defects
may
be
more
fully
ascertained

hayes

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and

of
representatives
with
devout
gratitude
to
the
bountiful
giver
of
all
good
i
congratulate
you
that
at
the
beginning
of
your
first
regular
session
you
find
our
country
blessed
with
health
and
peace
and
abundant
harvests
and
with
encouraging
prospects
of
an
early
return
of
general
prosperity
to
complete
and
make
permanent
the
pacification
of
the
country
continues
to
be
and
until
it
is
fully
accomplished
must
remain
the
most
important
of
all
our
national
interests
the
earnest
purpose
of
good
citizens
generally
to
unite
their
efforts
in
this
endeavor
is
evident
it
found
decided
expression
in
the
resolutions
announced
in
by

national
conventions
of
the
leading
political
parties
of
the
country
there
was
a
widespread
apprehension
that
the
momentous
results
in
our
progress
as
a
nation
marked
by
the
recent
amendments
to
the
constitution
were
in
imminent
jeopardy
that
the
good
understanding
which
prompted
their
adoption
in
the
interest
of
a
loyal
devotion
to
the
general
welfare
might
prove
a
barren
truce
and
that
the
two
sections
of
the
country
once
engaged
in
civil
strife
might
be
again
almost
as
widely
severed
and
disunited
as
they
were
when
arrayed
in
arms
against
each
other
the
course
to
be
pursued
which
in
my
judgment
seemed
wisest
in
the
presence
of
this
emergency
was
plainly
indicated
in
my
inaugural
address
it
pointed
to
the
time
which
all
our
people
desire
to
see
when
a
genuine
love
of
our
whole
country
and
of
all
that
concerns
its
true
welfare
shall
supplant
the
destructive
forces
of
the
mutual
animosity
of
races
and
of
sectional
hostility
opinions
have
differed
widely
as
to
the
measures
best
calculated
to
secure
this
great
end
this
was
to
be
expected
the
measures
adopted
by
the
administration
have
been
subjected
to
severe
and
varied
criticism
any
course
whatever
which
might
have
been
entered
upon
would
certainly
have
encountered
distrust
and
opposition
these
measures
were
in
my
judgment
such
as
were
most
in
harmony
with
the
constitution
and
with
the
genius
of
our
people
and
best
adapted
under
all
the
circumstances
to
attain
the
end
in
view
beneficent
results
already
apparent
prove
that
these
endeavors
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
mere
experiment
and
should
sustain
and
encourage
us
in
our
efforts
already
in
the
brief
period
which
has
elapsed
the
immediate
effectiveness
no
less
than
the
justice
of
the
course
pursued
is
demonstrated
and
i
have
an
abiding
faith
that
time
will
furnish
its
ample
vindication
in
the
minds
of
the
great
majority
of
my
fellowcitizens
the
discontinuance
of
the
use
of
the
army
for
the
purpose
of
upholding
local
governments
in
two
states
of
the
union
was
no
less
a
constitutional
duty
and
requirement
under
the
circumstances
existing
at
the
time
than
it
was
a
muchneeded
measure
for
the
restoration
of
local
selfgovernment
and
the
promotion
of
national
harmony
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
such
employment
was
effected
deliberately
and
with
solicitous
care
for
the
peace
and
good
order
of
society
and
the
protection
of
the
property
and
persons
and
every
right
of
all
classes
of
citizens
the
results
that
have
followed
are
indeed
significant
and
encouraging
all
apprehension
of
danger
from
remitting
those
states
to
local
selfgovernment
is
dispelled
and
a
most
salutary
change
in
the
minds
of
the
people
has
begun
and
is
in
progress
in
every
part
of
that
section
of
the
country
once
the
theater
of
unhappy
civil
strife
substituting
for
suspicion
distrust
and
aversion
concord
friendship
and
patriotic
attachment
to
the
union
no
unprejudiced
mind
will
deny
that
the
terrible
and
often
fatal
collisions
which
for
several
years
have
been
of
frequent
occurrence
and
have
agitated
and
alarmed
the
public
mind
have
almost
entirely
ceased
and
that
a
spirit
of
mutual
forbearance
and
hearty
national
interest
has
succeeded
there
has
been
a
general
reestablishment
of
order
and
of
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
instances
of
remaining
lawlessness
have
become
of
rare
occurrence
political
turmoil
and
turbulence
have
disappeared
useful
industries
have
been
resumed
public
credit
in
the
southern
states
has
been
greatly
strengthened
and
the
encouraging
benefits
of
a
revival
of
commerce
between
the
sections
of
the
country
lately
embroiled
in
civil
war
are
fully
enjoyed
such
are
some
of
the
results
already
attained
upon
which
the
country
is
to
be
congratulated
they
are
of
such
importance
that
we
may
with
confidence
patiently
await
the
desired
consummation
that
will
surely
come
with
the
natural
progress
of
events
it
may
not
be
improper
here
to
say
that
it
should
be
our
fixed
and
unalterable
determination
to
protect
by
all
available
and
proper
means
under
the
constitution
and
the
laws
the
lately
emancipated
race
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
rights
and
privileges
and
i
urge
upon
those
to
whom
heretofore
the
colored
people
have
sustained
the
relation
of
bondmen
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
humane
and
liberal
local
legislation
with
respect
to
their
education
and
general
welfare
a
firm
adherence
to
the
laws
both
national
and
state
as
to
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
the
colored
people
now
advanced
to
full
and
equal
citizenship
the
immediate
repression
and
sure
punishment
by
the
national
and
local
authorities
within
their
respective
jurisdictions
of
every
instance
of
lawlessness
and
violence
toward
them
is
required
for
the
security
alike
of
both
races
and
is
justly
demanded
by
the
public
opinion
of
the
country
and
the
age
in
this
way
the
restoration
of
harmony
and
good
will
and
the
complete
protection
of
every
citizen
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
every
constitutional
right
will
surely
be
attained
whatever
authority
rests
with
me
to
this
end
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
put
forth
whatever
belongs
to
the
power
of
congress
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
union
they
may
confidently
be
relied
upon
to
provide
and
perform
and
to
the
legislatures
the
courts
and
the
executive
authorities
of
the
several
states
i
earnestly
appeal
to
secure
by
adequate
appropriate
and
seasonable
means
within
their
borders
these
common
and
uniform
rights
of
a
united
people
which
loves
liberty
abhors
oppression
and
reveres
justice
these
objects
are
very
dear
to
my
heart
i
shall
continue
most
earnestly
to
strive
for
their
attainment
the
cordial
cooperation
of
all
classes
of
all
sections
of
the
country
and
of
both
races
is
required
for
this
purpose
and
with
these
blessings
assured
and
not
otherwise
we
may
safely
hope
to
hand
down
our
free
institutions
of
government
unimpaired
to
the
generations
that
will
succeed
us
among
the
other
subjects
of
great
and
general
importance
to
the
people
of
this
country
i
can
not
be
mistaken
i
think
in
regarding
as
preeminent
the
policy
and
measures
which
are
designed
to
secure
the
restoration
of
the
currency
to
that
normal
and
healthful
condition
in
which
by
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
our
internal
trade
and
foreign
commerce
may
be
brought
into
harmony
with
the
system
of
exchanges
which
is
based
upon
the
precious
metals
as
the
intrinsic
money
of
the
world
in
the
public
judgment
that
this
end
should
be
sought
and
compassed
as
speedily
and
securely
as
the
resources
of
the
people
and
the
wisdom
of
their
government
can
accomplish
there
is
a
much
greater
degree
of
unanimity
than
is
found
to
concur
in
the
specific
measures
which
will
bring
the
country
to
this
desired
end
or
the
rapidity
of
the
steps
by
which
it
can
be
safely
reached
upon
a
most
anxious
and
deliberate
examination
which
i
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
give
to
the
subject
i
am
but
the
more
confirmed
in
the
opinion
which
i
expressed
in
accepting
the
nomination
for
the
presidency
and
again
upon
my
inauguration
that
the
policy
of
resumption
should
be
pursued
by
every
suitable
means
and
that
no
legislation
would
be
wise
that
should
disparage
the
importance
or
retard
the
attainment
of
that
result
i
have
no
disposition
and
certainly
no
right
to
question
the
sincerity
or
the
intelligence
of
opposing
opinions
and
would
neither
conceal
nor
undervalue
the
considerable
difficulties
and
even
occasional
distresses
which
may
attend
the
progress
of
the
nation
toward
this
primary
condition
to
its
general
and
permanent
prosperity
i
must
however
adhere
to
my
most
earnest
conviction
that
any
wavering
in
purpose
or
unsteadiness
in
methods
so
far
from
avoiding
or
reducing
the
inconvenience
inseparable
from
the
transition
from
an
irredeemable
to
a
redeemable
paper
currency
would
only
tend
to
increased
and
prolonged
disturbance
in
values
and
unless
retrieved
must
end
in
serious
disorder
dishonor
and
disaster
in
the
financial
affairs
of
the
government
and
of
the
people
the
mischiefs
which
i
apprehend
and
urgently
deprecate
are
confined
to
no
class
of
the
people
indeed
but
seem
to
me
most
certainly
to
threaten
the
industrious
masses
whether
their
occupations
are
of
skilled
or
common
labor
to
them
it
seems
to
me
it
is
of
prime
importance
that
their
labor
should
be
compensated
in
money
which
is
itself
fixed
in
exchangeable
value
by
being
irrevocably
measured
by
the
labor
necessary
to
its
production
this
permanent
quality
of
the
money
of
the
people
is
sought
for
and
can
only
be
gained
by
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
the
rich
the
speculative
the
operating
the
moneydealing
classes
may
not
always
feel
the
mischiefs
of
or
may
find
casual
profits
in
a
variable
currency
but
the
misfortunes
of
such
a
currency
to
those
who
are
paid
salaries
or
wages
are
inevitable
and
remediless
closely
connected
with
this
general
subject
of
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
is
one
of
subordinate
but
still
of
grave
importance
i
mean
the
readjustment
of
our
coinage
system
by
the
renewal
of
the
silver
dollar
as
an
element
in
our
specie
currency
endowed
by
legislation
with
the
quality
of
legal
tender
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
as
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
power
of
congress
under
the
constitution
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
thereof
and
as
this
power
covers
the
whole
range
of
authority
applicable
to
the
metal
the
rated
value
and
the
legaltender
quality
which
shall
be
adop
ted
for
the
coinage
the
considerations
which
should
induce
or
discourage
a
particular
measure
connected
with
the
coinage
belong
clearly
to
the
province
of
legislative
discretion
and
of
public
expediency
without
intruding
upon
this
province
of
legislation
in
the
least
i
have
yet
thought
the
subject
of
such
critical
importance
in
the
actual
condition
of
our
affairs
as
to
present
an
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
the
duty
imposed
by
the
constitution
on
the
president
of
recommending
to
the
consideration
of
congress
such
measures
as
he
shall
judge
necessary
and
expedient
holding
the
opinion
as
i
do
that
neither
the
interests
of
the
government
nor
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
would
be
promoted
by
disparaging
silver
as
one
of
the
two
precious
metals
which
furnish
the
coinage
of
the
world
and
that
legislation
which
looks
to
maintaining
the
volume
of
intrinsic
money
to
as
full
a
measure
of
both
metals
as
their
relative
commercial
values
will
permit
would
be
neither
unjust
nor
inexpedient
i
must
ask
your
indulgence
to
a
brief
and
definite
statement
of
certain
essential
features
in
any
such
legislative
measure
which
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
recommend
i
do
not
propose
to
enter
the
debate
represented
on
both
sides
by
such
able
disputants
in
congress
and
before
the
people
and
in
the
press
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
legislation
of
any
one
nation
can
control
this
question
even
within
its
own
borders
against
the
unwritten
laws
of
trade
or
the
positive
laws
of
other
governments
the
wisdom
of
congress
in
shaping
any
particular
law
that
may
be
presented
for
my
approval
may
wholly
supersede
the
necessity
of
my
entering
into
these
considerations
and
i
willingly
avoid
either
vague
or
intricate
inquiries
it
is
only
certain
plain
and
practical
traits
of
such
legislation
that
i
desire
to
recommend
to
your
attention
in
any
legislation
providing
for
a
silver
coinage
regulating
its
value
and
imparting
to
it
the
quality
of
legal
tender
it
seems
to
me
of
great
importance
that
congress
should
not
lose
sight
of
its
action
as
operating
in
a
twofold
capacity
and
in
two
distinct
directions
if
the
united
states
government
were
free
from
a
public
debt
its
legislative
dealing
with
the
question
of
silver
coinage
would
be
purely
sovereign
and
governmental
under
no
restraints
but
those
of
constitutional
power
and
the
public
good
as
affected
by
the
proposed
legislation
but
in
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
nation
with
a
vast
public
debt
distributed
very
widely
among
our
own
citizens
and
held
in
great
amounts
also
abroad
the
nature
of
the
silvercoinage
measure
as
affecting
this
relation
of
the
government
to
the
holders
of
the
public
debt
becomes
an
element
in
any
proposed
legislation
of
the
highest
concern
the
obligation
of
the
public
faith
transcends
all
questions
of
profit
or
public
advantage
otherwise
its
unquestionable
maintenance
is
the
dictate
as
well
of
the
highest
expediency
as
of
the
most
necessary
duty
and
will
ever
be
carefully
guarded
by
congress
and
people
alike
the
public
debt
of
the
united
states
to
the
amount
of
bears
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
and
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
and
the
only
way
in
which
the
country
can
be
relieved
from
the
payment
of
these
high
rates
of
interest
is
by
advantageously
refunding
the
indebtedness
whether
the
debt
is
ultimately
paid
in
gold
or
in
silver
coin
is
of
but
little
moment
compared
with
the
possible
reduction
of
interest
onethird
by
refunding
it
at
such
reduced
rate
if
the
united
states
had
the
unquestioned
right
to
pay
its
bonds
in
silver
coin
the
little
benefit
from
that
process
would
be
greatly
overbalanced
by
the
injurious
effect
of
such
payment
if
made
or
proposed
against
the
honest
convictions
of
the
public
creditors
all
the
bonds
that
have
been
issued
since
february
when
gold
became
the
only
unlimited
legaltender
metallic
currency
of
the
country
are
justly
payable
in
gold
coin
or
in
coin
of
equal
value
during
the
time
of
these
issues
the
only
dollar
that
could
be
or
was
received
by
the
government
in
exchange
for
bonds
was
the
gold
dollar
to
require
the
public
creditors
to
take
in
repayment
any
dollar
of
less
commercial
value
would
be
regarded
by
them
as
a
repudiation
of
the
full
obligation
assumed
the
bonds
issued
prior
to
were
issued
at
a
time
when
the
gold
dollar
was
the
only
coin
in
circulation
or
contemplated
by
either
the
government
or
the
holders
of
the
bonds
as
the
coin
in
which
they
were
to
be
paid
it
is
far
better
to
pay
these
bonds
in
that
coin
than
to
seem
to
take
advantage
of
the
unforeseen
fall
in
silver
bullion
to
pay
in
a
new
issue
of
silver
coin
thus
made
so
much
less
valuable
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
coin
money
and
to
regulate
the
value
thereof
ought
never
to
be
exercised
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
government
to
pay
its
obligations
in
a
coin
of
less
value
than
that
contemplated
by
the
parties
when
the
bonds
were
issued
any
attempt
to
pay
the
national
indebtedness
in
a
coinage
of
less
commercial
value
than
the
money
of
the
world
would
involve
a
violation
of
the
public
faith
and
work
irreparable
injury
to
the
public
credit
it
was
the
great
merit
of
the
act
of
march
in
strengthening
the
public
credit
that
it
removed
all
doubt
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
united
states
to
pay
their
bonded
debt
in
coin
that
act
was
accepted
as
a
pledge
of
public
faith
the
government
has
derived
great
benefit
from
it
in
the
progress
thus
far
made
in
refunding
the
public
debt
at
low
rates
of
interest
an
adherence
to
the
wise
and
just
policy
of
an
exact
observance
of
the
public
faith
will
enable
the
government
rapidly
to
reduce
the
burden
of
interest
on
the
national
debt
to
an
amount
exceeding
per
annum
and
effect
an
aggregate
saving
to
the
united
states
of
more
than
before
the
bonds
can
be
fully
paid
in
adapting
the
new
silver
coinage
to
the
ordinary
uses
of
currency
in
the
everyday
transactions
of
life
and
prescribing
the
quality
of
legal
tender
to
be
assigned
to
it
a
consideration
of
the
first
importance
should
be
so
to
adjust
the
ratio
between
the
silver
and
the
gold
coinage
which
now
constitutes
our
specie
currency
as
to
accomplish
the
desired
end
of
maintaining
the
circulation
of
the
two
metallic
currencies
and
keeping
up
the
volume
of
the
two
precious
metals
as
our
intrinsic
money
it
is
a
mixed
question
for
scientific
reasoning
and
historical
experience
to
determine
how
far
and
by
what
methods
a
practical
equilibrium
can
be
maintained
which
will
keep
both
metals
in
circulation
in
their
appropriate
spheres
of
common
use
an
absolute
equality
of
commercial
value
free
from
disturbing
fluctuations
is
hardly
attainable
and
without
it
an
unlimited
legal
tender
for
private
transactions
assigned
to
both
metals
would
irresistibly
tend
to
drive
out
of
circulation
the
clearer
coinage
and
disappoint
the
principal
object
proposed
by
the
legislation
in
view
i
apprehend
therefore
that
the
two
conditions
of
a
near
approach
to
equality
of
commercial
value
between
the
gold
and
silver
coinage
of
the
same
denomination
and
of
a
limitation
of
the
amounts
for
which
the
silver
coinage
is
to
be
a
legal
tender
are
essential
to
maintaining
both
in
circulation
if
these
conditions
can
be
successfully
observed
the
issue
from
the
mint
of
silver
dollars
would
afford
material
assistance
to
the
community
in
the
transition
to
redeemable
paper
money
and
would
facilitate
the
resumption
of
specie
payment
and
its
permanent
establishment
without
these
conditions
i
fear
that
only
mischief
and
misfortune
would
flow
from
a
coinage
of
silver
dollars
with
the
quality
of
unlimited
legal
tender
even
in
private
transactions
any
expectation
of
temporary
ease
from
an
issue
of
silver
coinage
to
pass
as
a
legal
tender
at
a
rate
materially
above
its
commercial
value
is
i
am
persuaded
a
delusion
nor
can
i
think
that
there
is
any
substantial
distinction
between
an
original
issue
of
silver
dollars
at
a
nominal
value
materially
above
their
commercial
value
and
the
restoration
of
the
silver
dollar
at
a
rate
which
once
was
but
has
ceased
to
be
its
commercial
value
certainly
the
issue
of
our
gold
coinage
reduced
in
weight
materially
below
its
legaltender
value
would
not
be
any
the
less
a
present
debasement
of
the
coinage
by
reason
of
its
equaling
or
even
exceeding
in
weight
a
gold
coinage
which
at
some
past
time
had
been
commercially
equal
to
the
legaltender
value
assigned
to
the
new
issue
in
recommending
that
the
regulation
of
any
silver
coinage
which
may
be
authorized
by
congress
should
observe
these
conditions
of
commercial
value
and
limited
legal
tender
i
am
governed
by
the
feeling
that
every
possible
increase
should
be
given
to
the
volume
of
metallic
money
which
can
be
kept
in
circulation
and
thereby
every
possible
aid
afforded
to
the
people
in
the
process
of
resuming
specie
payments
it
is
because
of
my
firm
conviction
that
a
disregard
of
these
conditions
would
frustrate
the
good
results
which
are
desired
from
the
proposed
coinage
and
embarrass
with
new
elements
of
confusion
and
uncertainty
the
business
of
the
country
that
i
urge
upon
your
attention
these
considerations
i
respectfully
recommend
to
congress
that
in
any
legislation
providing
for
a
silver
coinage
and
imparting
to
it
the
quality
of
legal
tender
there
be
impressed
upon
the
measure
a
firm
provision
exempting
the
public
debt
heretofore
issued
and
now
outstanding
from
payment
either
of
principal
or
interest
in
any
coinage
of
less
commercial
value
than
the
present
gold
coinage
of
the
country
the
organization
of
the
civil
service
of
the
country
has
for
a
number
of
years
attracted
more
and
more
of
the
public
attention
so
general
has
become
the
opinion
that
the
methods
of
admission
to
it
and
the
conditions
of
remaining
in
it
are
unsound
that
both
the
great
political
parties
have
agreed
in
the
most
explicit
declarations
of
the
necessity
of
reform
and
in
the
most
emphatic
demands
for
it
i
have
fully
believed
these
declarations
and
demands
to
be
the
expression
of
a
sincere
conviction
of
the
intelligent
masses
of
the
people
upon
the
subject
and
that
they
should
be
recognized
and
fol
lowed
by
earnest
and
prompt
action
on
the
part
of
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
of
the
government
in
pursuance
of
the
purpose
indicated
before
my
accession
to
office
i
endeavored
to
have
my
own
views
distinctly
understood
and
upon
my
inauguration
my
accord
with
the
public
opinion
was
stated
in
terms
believed
to
be
plain
and
unambiguous
my
experience
in
the
executive
duties
has
strongly
confirmed
the
belief
in
the
great
advantage
the
country
would
find
in
observing
strictly
the
plan
of
the
constitution
which
imposes
upon
the
executive
the
sole
duty
and
responsibility
of
the
selection
of
those
federal
officers
who
by
law
are
appointed
not
elected
and
which
in
like
manner
assigns
to
the
senate
the
complete
right
to
advise
and
consent
to
or
to
reject
the
nominations
so
made
whilst
the
house
of
representatives
stands
as
the
public
censor
of
the
performance
of
official
duties
with
the
prerogative
of
investigation
and
prosecution
in
all
cases
of
dereliction
the
blemishes
and
imperfections
in
the
civil
service
may
as
i
think
be
traced
in
most
cases
to
a
practical
confusion
of
the
duties
assigned
to
the
several
departments
of
the
government
my
purpose
in
this
respect
has
been
to
return
to
the
system
established
by
the
fundamental
law
and
to
do
this
with
the
heartiest
cooperation
and
most
cordial
understanding
with
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
the
practical
difficulties
in
the
selection
of
numerous
officers
for
posts
of
widely
varying
responsibilities
and
duties
are
acknowledged
to
be
very
great
no
system
can
be
expected
to
secure
absolute
freedom
from
mistakes
and
the
beginning
of
any
attempted
change
of
custom
is
quite
likely
to
be
more
embarrassed
in
this
respect
than
any
subsequent
period
it
is
here
that
the
constitution
seems
to
me
to
prove
its
claim
to
the
great
wisdom
accorded
to
it
it
gives
to
the
executive
the
assistance
of
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
senate
which
when
acting
upon
nominations
as
to
which
they
may
be
disinterested
and
impartial
judges
secures
as
strong
a
guaranty
of
freedom
from
errors
of
importance
as
is
perhaps
possible
in
human
affairs
in
addition
to
this
i
recognize
the
public
advantage
of
making
all
nominations
as
nearly
as
possible
impersonal
in
the
sense
of
being
free
from
mere
caprice
or
favor
in
the
selection
and
in
those
offices
in
which
special
training
is
of
greatly
increased
value
i
believe
such
a
rule
as
to
the
tenure
of
office
should
obtain
as
may
induce
men
of
proper
qualifications
to
apply
themselves
industriously
to
the
task
of
becoming
proficients
bearing
these
things
in
mind
i
have
endeavored
to
reduce
the
number
of
changes
in
subordinate
places
usually
made
upon
the
change
of
the
general
administration
and
shall
most
heartily
cooperate
with
congress
in
the
better
systematizing
of
such
methods
and
rules
of
admission
to
the
public
service
and
of
promotion
within
it
as
may
promise
to
be
most
successful
in
making
thorough
competency
efficiency
and
character
the
decisive
tests
in
these
matters
i
ask
the
renewed
attention
of
congress
to
what
has
already
been
done
by
the
civil
service
commission
appointed
in
pursuance
of
an
act
of
congress
by
my
predecessor
to
prepare
and
revise
civilservice
rules
in
regard
to
much
of
the
departmental
service
especially
at
washington
it
may
be
difficult
to
organize
a
better
system
than
that
which
has
thus
been
provided
and
it
is
now
being
used
to
a
considerable
extent
under
my
direction
the
commission
has
still
a
legal
existence
although
for
several
years
no
appropriation
has
been
made
for
defraying
its
expenses
believing
that
this
commission
has
rendered
valuable
service
and
will
be
a
most
useful
agency
in
improving
the
administration
of
the
civil
service
i
respectfully
recommend
that
a
suitable
appropriation
to
be
immediately
available
be
made
to
enable
it
to
continue
its
labors
it
is
my
purpose
to
transmit
to
congress
as
early
as
practicable
a
report
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
to
ask
your
attention
to
such
measures
on
this
subject
as
in
my
opinion
will
further
promote
the
improvement
of
the
civil
service
during
the
past
year
the
united
states
have
continued
to
maintain
peaceful
relations
with
foreign
powers
the
outbreak
of
war
between
russia
and
turkey
though
at
one
time
attended
by
grave
apprehension
as
to
its
effect
upon
other
european
nations
has
had
no
tendency
to
disturb
the
amicable
relations
existing
between
the
united
states
and
each
of
the
two
contending
powers
an
attitude
of
just
and
impartial
neutrality
has
been
preserved
and
i
am
gratified
to
state
that
in
the
midst
of
their
hostilities
both
the
russian
and
the
turkish
governments
have
shown
an
earnest
disposition
to
adhere
to
the
obligations
of
all
treaties
with
the
united
states
and
to
give
due
regard
to
the
rights
of
american
citizens
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
defining
the
rights
immunities
and
privileges
of
consuls
between
italy
and
the
united
states
ratified
in
either
government
may
after
the
lapse
of
ten
years
terminate
the
existence
of
the
treaty
by
giving
twelve
months
notice
of
its
intention
the
government
of
italy
availing
itself
of
this
faculty
has
now
given
the
required
notice
and
the
treaty
will
accordingly
end
on
the
th
of
september
it
is
understood
however
that
the
italian
government
wishes
to
renew
it
in
its
general
scope
desiring
only
certain
modifications
in
some
of
its
articles
in
this
disposition
i
concur
and
shall
hope
that
no
serious
obstacles
may
intervene
to
prevent
or
delay
the
negotiation
of
a
satisfactory
treaty
numerous
questions
in
regard
to
passports
naturalization
and
exemption
from
military
service
have
continued
to
arise
in
cases
of
emigrants
from
germany
who
have
returned
to
their
native
country
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
february
however
have
proved
to
be
so
ample
and
so
judicious
that
the
legation
of
the
united
states
at
berlin
has
been
able
to
adjust
all
claims
arising
under
it
not
only
without
detriment
to
the
amicable
relations
existing
between
the
two
governments
but
it
is
believed
without
injury
or
injustice
to
any
duly
naturalized
american
citizen
it
is
desirable
that
the
treaty
originally
made
with
the
north
german
union
in
should
now
be
extended
so
as
to
apply
equally
to
all
the
states
of
the
empire
of
germany
the
invitation
of
the
government
of
france
to
participate
in
the
exposition
of
the
products
of
agriculture
industry
and
the
fine
arts
to
be
held
at
paris
during
the
coming
year
was
submitted
for
your
consideration
at
the
extra
session
it
is
not
doubted
that
its
acceptance
by
the
united
states
and
a
wellselected
exhibition
of
the
products
of
american
industry
on
that
occasion
will
tend
to
stimulate
international
commerce
and
emigration
as
well
as
to
promote
the
traditional
friendship
between
the
two
countries
a
question
arose
some
time
since
as
to
the
proper
meaning
of
the
extradition
articles
of
the
treaty
of
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
both
governments
however
are
now
in
accord
in
the
belief
that
the
question
is
not
one
that
should
be
allowed
to
frustrate
the
ends
of
justice
or
to
disturb
the
friendship
between
the
two
nations
no
serious
difficulty
has
arisen
in
accomplishing
the
extradition
of
criminals
when
necessary
it
is
probable
that
all
points
of
disagreement
will
in
due
time
be
settled
and
if
need
be
more
explicit
declarations
be
made
in
a
new
treaty
the
fishery
commission
under
articles
xviii
to
xxv
of
the
treaty
of
washington
has
concluded
its
session
at
halifax
the
result
of
the
deliberations
of
the
commission
as
made
public
by
the
commissioners
will
be
communicated
to
congress
a
treaty
for
the
protection
of
trademarks
has
been
negotiated
with
great
britain
which
has
been
submitted
to
the
senate
for
its
consideration
the
revolution
which
recently
occurred
in
mexico
was
followed
by
the
accession
of
the
successful
party
to
power
and
the
installation
of
its
chief
general
porfirio
diaz
in
the
presidential
office
it
has
been
the
custom
of
the
united
states
when
such
changes
of
government
have
heretofore
occurred
in
mexico
to
recognize
and
enter
into
official
relations
with
the
de
facto
government
as
soon
as
it
should
appear
to
have
the
approval
of
the
mexican
people
and
should
manifest
a
disposition
to
adhere
to
the
obligations
of
treaties
and
international
friendship
in
the
present
case
such
official
recognition
has
been
deferred
by
the
occurrences
on
the
rio
grande
border
the
records
of
which
have
been
already
communicated
to
each
house
of
congress
in
answer
to
their
respective
resolutions
of
inquiry
assurances
have
been
received
that
the
authorities
at
the
seat
of
the
mexican
government
have
both
the
disposition
and
the
power
to
prevent
and
punish
such
unlawful
invasions
and
depredations
it
is
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
events
may
prove
these
assurances
to
be
well
rounded
the
best
interests
of
both
countries
require
the
maintenance
of
peace
upon
the
border
and
the
development
of
commerce
between
the
two
republics
it
is
gratifying
to
add
that
this
temporary
interruption
of
official
relations
has
not
prevented
due
attention
by
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
in
mexico
to
the
protection
of
american
citizens
so
far
as
practicable
nor
has
it
interfered
with
the
prompt
payment
of
the
amounts
due
from
mexico
to
the
united
states
under
the
treaty
of
july
and
the
awards
of
the
joint
commission
while
i
do
not
anticipate
an
interruption
of
friendly
relations
with
mexico
yet
i
can
not
but
look
with
some
solicitude
upon
a
continuance
of
border
disorders
as
exposing
the
two
countries
to
initiations
of
popular
feeling
and
mischances
of
action
which
are
naturally
unfavorable
to
complete
amity
firmly
determined
that
nothing
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
to
promote
a
good
understanding
between
the
two
nations
i
yet
must
ask
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
actual
occurrences
on
the
border
that
the
lives
and
property
of
our
citizens
may
be
adequately
protected
and
peace
preserved
another
year
has
passed
without
bringing
to
a
close
the
protracted
contest
between
the
spanish

government
and
the
insurrection
in
the
island
of
cuba
while
the
united
states
have
sedulously
abstained
from
any
intervention
in
this
contest
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
it
is
attended
with
incidents
affecting
the
rights
and
interests
of
american
citizens
apart
from
the
effect
of
the
hostilities
upon
trade
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
their
progress
is
inevitably
accompanied
by
complaints
having
more
or
less
foundation
of
searches
arrests
embargoes
and
oppressive
taxes
upon
the
property
of
american
residents
and
of
unprovoked
interference
with
american
vessels
and
commerce
it
is
due
to
the
government
of
spain
to
say
that
during
the
past
year
it
has
promptly
disavowed
and
offered
reparation
for
any
unauthorized
acts
of
unduly
zealous
subordinates
whenever
such
acts
have
been
brought
to
its
attention
nevertheless
such
occurrences
can
not
but
tend
to
excite
feelings
of
annoyance
suspicion
and
resentment
which
are
greatly
to
be
deprecated
between
the
respective
subjects
and
citizens
of
two
friendly
powers
much
delay
consequent
upon
accusations
of
fraud
in
some
of
the
awards
has
occurred
in
respect
to
the
distribution
of
the
limited
amounts
received
from
venezuela
under
the
treaty
of
april
applicable
to
the
awards
of
the
joint
commission
created
by
that
treaty
so
long
as
these
matters
are
pending
in
congress
the
executive
can
not
assume
either
to
pass
upon
the
questions
presented
or
to
distribute
the
fund
received
it
is
eminently
desirable
that
definite
legislative
action
should
be
taken
either
affirming
the
awards
to
be
final
or
providing
some
method
for
reexamination
of
the
claims
our
relations
with
the
republics
of
central
and
south
america
and
with
the
empire
of
brazil
have
continued
without
serious
change
further
than
the
temporary
interruption
of
diplomatic
intercourse
with
venezuela
and
with
guatemala
amicable
relations
have
already
been
fully
restored
with
venezuela
and
it
is
not
doubted
that
all
grounds
of
misunderstanding
with
guatemala
will
speedily
be
removed
from
all
these
countries
there
are
favorable
indications
of
a
disposition
on
the
part
of
their
governments
and
people
to
reciprocate
our
efforts
in
the
direction
of
increased
commercial
intercourse
the
government
of
the
samoan
islands
has
sent
an
envoy
in
the
person
of
its
secretary
of
state
to
invite
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
recognize
and
protect
their
independence
to
establish
commercial
relations
with
their
people
and
to
assist
them
in
their
steps
toward
regulated
and
responsible
government
the
inhabitants
of
these
islands
having
made
considerable
progress
in
christian
civilization
and
the
development
of
trade
are
doubtful
of
their
ability
to
maintain
peace
and
independence
without
the
aid
of
some
stronger
power
the
subject
is
deemed
worthy
of
respectful
attention
and
the
claims
upon
our
assistance
by
this
distant
community
will
be
carefully
considered
the
long
commercial
depression
in
the
united
states
has
directed
attention
to
the
subject
of
the
possible
increase
of
our
foreign
trade
and
the
methods
for
its
development
not
only
with
europe
but
with
other
countries
and
especially
with
the
states
and
sovereignties
of
the
western
hemisphere
instructions
from
the
department
of
state
were
issued
to
the
various
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
of
the
government
asking
them
to
devote
attention
to
the
question
of
methods
by
which
trade
between
the
respective
countries
of
their
official
residence
and
the
united
states
could
be
most
judiciously
fostered
in
obedience
to
these
instructions
examinations
and
reports
upon
this
subject
have
been
made
by
many
of
these
officers
and
transmitted
to
the
department
and
the
same
are
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
the
state
of
the
finances
presents
important
questions
for
the
action
of
congress
upon
some
of
which
i
have
already
remarked
the
revenues
of
the
government
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
were
the
total
expenditures
for
the
same
period
were
leaving
a
surplus
revenue
of
this
has
substantially
supplied
the
requirements
of
the
sinking
fund
for
that
year
the
estimated
revenues
of
the
current
fiscal
year
are
and
the
estimated
expenditures
for
the
same
period
are
if
these
estimates
prove
to
be
correct
there
will
be
a
surplus
revenue
of
an
amount
nearly
sufficient
for
the
sinking
fund
for
that
year
the
estimated
revenues
for
the
next
fiscal
year
are
it
appears
from
the
report
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
revenues
of
the
government
compared
with
the
previous
year
have
largely
decreased
this
decrease
amounting
to
the
sum
of
was
mainly
in
customs
duties
caused
partly
by
a
large
falling
off
of
the
amount
of
imported
dutiable
goods
and
partly
by
the
general
fall
of
prices
in
the
markets
of
production
of
such
articles
as
pay
ad
valorem
taxes
while
this
is
felt
injuriously
in
the
diminution
of
the
revenue
it
has
been
accompanied
with
a
very
large
increase
of
exportations
the
total
exports
during
the
last
fiscal
year
including
coin
have
been
and
the
imports
have
been
leaving
a
balance
of
trade
in
favor
of
the
united
states
amounting
to
the
sum
of
the
beneficial
effects
of
which
extend
to
all
branches
of
business
the
estimated
revenue
for
the
next
fiscal
year
will
impose
upon
congress
the
duty
of
strictly
limiting
appropriations
including
the
requisite
sum
for
the
maintenance
of
the
sinking
fund
within
the
aggregate
estimated
receipts
while
the
aggregate
of
taxes
should
not
be
increased
amendments
might
be
made
to
the
revenue
laws
that
would
without
diminishing
the
revenue
relieve
the
people
from
unnecessary
burdens
a
tax
on
tea
and
coffee
is
shown
by
the
experience
not
only
of
our
own
country
but
of
other
countries
to
be
easily
collected
without
loss
by
undervaluation
or
fraud
and
largely
borne
in
the
country
of
production
a
tax
of
cents
a
pound
on
tea
and
cents
a
pound
on
coffee
would
produce
a
revenue
exceeding
and
thus
enable
congress
to
repeal
a
multitude
of
annoying
taxes
yielding
a
revenue
not
exceeding
that
sum
the
internalrevenue
system
grew
out
of
the
necessities
of
the
war
and
most
of
the
legislation
imposing
taxes
upon
domestic
products
under
this
system
has
been
repealed
by
the
substitution
of
a
tax
on
tea
and
coffee
all
forms
of
internal
taxation
may
be
repealed
except
that
on
whisky
spirits
tobacco
and
beer
attention
is
also
called
to
the
necessity
of
enacting
more
vigorous
laws
for
the
protection
of
the
revenue
and
for
the
punishment
of
frauds
and
smuggling
this
can
best
be
done
by
judicious
provisions
that
will
induce
the
disclosure
of
attempted
fraud
by
undervaluation
and
smuggling
all
revenue
laws
should
be
simple
in
their
provisions
and
easily
understood
so
far
as
practicable
the
rates
of
taxation
should
be
in
the
form
of
specific
duties
and
not
ad
valorem
requiring
the
judgment
of
experienced
men
to
ascertain
values
and
exposing
the
revenue
to
the
temptation
of
fraud
my
attention
has
been
called
during
the
recess
of
congress
to
abuses
existing
in
the
collection
of
the
customs
and
strenuous
efforts
have
been
made
for
their
correction
by
executive
orders
the
recommendations
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
by
a
commission
appointed
to
examine
into
the
collection
of
customs
duties
at
the
port
of
new
york
contain
many
suggestions
for
the
modification
of
the
customs
laws
to
which
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
it
is
matter
of
congratulation
that
notwithstanding
the
severe
burdens
caused
by
the
war
the
public
faith
with
all
creditors
has
been
preserved
and
that
as
the
result
of
this
policy
the
public
credit
has
continuously
advanced
and
our
public
securities
are
regarded
with
the
highest
favor
in
the
markets
of
the
world
i
trust
that
no
act
of
the
government
will
cast
a
shadow
upon
its
credit
the
progress
of
refunding
the
public
debt
has
been
rapid
and
satisfactory
under
the
contract
existing
when
i
entered
upon
the
discharge
of
the
duties
of
my
office
bonds
bearing
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
were
being
rapidly
sold
and
within
three
months
the
aggregate
sales
of
these
bonds
had
reached
the
sum
of
with
my
sanction
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
entered
into
a
new
contract
for
the
sale
of
per
cent
bonds
and
within
thirty
days
after
the
popular
subscription
for
such
bonds
was
opened
subscriptions
were
had
amounting
to
which
were
paid
for
within
ninety
days
after
the
date
of
subscription
by
this
process
within
but
little
more
than
one
year
the
annual
interest
on
the
public
debt
was
reduced
in
the
sum
of
i
recommended
that
suitable
provision
be
made
to
enable
the
people
to
easily
convert
their
savings
into
government
securities
as
the
best
mode
in
which
small
savings
may
be
well
secured
and
yield
a
moderate
interest
it
is
an
object
of
public
policy
to
retain
among
our
own
people
the
securities
of
the
united
states
in
this
way
our
country
is
guarded
against
their
sudden
return
from
foreign
countries
caused
by
war
or
other
disturbances
beyond
our
limits
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
with
foreign
nations
and
especially
the
export
of
domestic
productions
has
of
late
years
largely
increased
but
the
greater
portion
of
this
trade
is
conducted
in
foreign
vessels
the
importance
of
enlarging
our
foreign
trade
and
especially
by
direct
and
speedy
interchange
with
countries
on
this
continent
can
not
be
overestimated
and
it
is
a
matter
of
great
moment
that
our
own
shipping
interest
should
receive
to
the
utmost
practical
extent
the
benefit
of
our
commerce
with
other
lands
these
considerations
are
forcibly
urged
by
all
the
large
commercial
cities
of
the
country
and
public
attention
is
generally
and
wisely
attracted
to
the
solution
of
the
problems
they
present
it
is
not
doubted
that
congress
will
take
them
up
in
the
broadest
spirit
of
liberality
and
respond
to
the
public
demand
by
practical
legislation
upon
this
important
subject
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
shows
that
the
army
has
been
actively
employed
during
the
year
and
has
rendered
very
important
service
in
suppressing
hostilities
in
the
in
dian
country
and
in
preserving
peace
and
protecting
life
and
property
in
the
interior
as
well
as
along
the
mexican
border
a
long
and
arduous
campaign
has
been
prosecuted
with
final
complete
success
against
a
portion
of
the
nez
perce
tribe
of
indians
a
full
account
of
this
campaign
will
be
found
in
the
report
of
the
general
of
the
army
it
will
be
seen
that
in
its
course
several
severe
battles
were
fought
in
which
a
number
of
gallant
officers
and
men
lost
their
lives
i
join
with
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
general
of
the
army
in
awarding
to
the
officers
and
men
employed
in
the
long
and
toilsome
pursuit
and
in
the
final
capture
of
these
indians
the
honor
and
praise
which
are
so
justly
their
due
the
very
serious
riots
which
occurred
in
several
of
the
states
in
july
last
rendered
necessary
the
employment
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
army
to
preserve
the
peace
and
maintain
order
in
the
states
of
west
virginia
maryland
pennsylvania
and
illinois
these
disturbances
were
so
formidable
as
to
defy
the
local
and
state
authorities
and
the
national
executive
was
called
upon
in
the
mode
provided
by
the
constitution
and
laws
to
furnish
military
aid
i
am
gratified
to
be
able
to
state
that
the
troops
sent
in
response
to
these
calls
for
aid
in
the
suppression
of
domestic
violence
were
able
by
the
influence
of
their
presence
in
the
disturbed
regions
to
preserve
the
peace
and
restore
order
without
the
use
of
force
in
the
discharge
of
this
delicate
and
important
duty
both
officers
and
men
acted
with
great
prudence
and
courage
and
for
their
services
deserve
the
thanks
of
the
country
disturbances
along
the
rio
grande
in
texas
to
which
i
have
already
referred
have
rendered
necessary
the
constant
employment
of
a
military
force
in
that
vicinity
a
full
report
of
all
recent
military
operations
in
that
quarter
has
been
transmitted
to
the
house
of
representatives
in
answer
to
a
resolution
of
that
body
and
it
will
therefore
not
be
necessary
to
enter
into
details
i
regret
to
say
that
these
lawless
incursions
into
our
territory
by
armed
bands
from
the
mexican
side
of
the
line
for
the
purpose
of
robbery
have
been
of
frequent
occurrence
and
in
spite
of
the
most
vigilant
efforts
of
the
commander
of
our
forces
the
marauders
have
generally
succeeded
in
escaping
into
mexico
with
their
plunder
in
may
last
i
gave
orders
for
the
exercise
of
the
utmost
vigilance
on
the
part
of
our
troops
for
the
suppression
of
these
raids
and
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
parties
as
well
as
the
recapture
of
property
stolen
by
them
general
ord
commanding
in
texas
was
directed
to
invite
the
cooperation
of
the
mexican
authorities
in
efforts
to
this
end
and
to
assure
them
that
i
was
anxious
to
avoid
giving
the
least
offense
to
mexico
at
the
same
time
he
was
directed
to
give
notice
of
my
determination
to
put
an
end
to
the
invasion
of
our
territory
by
lawless
bands
intent
upon
the
plunder
of
our
peaceful
citizens
even
if
the
effectual
punishment
of
the
outlaws
should
make
the
crossing
of
the
border
by
our
troops
in
their
pursuit
necessary
it
is
believed
that
this
policy
has
had
the
effect
to
check
somewhat
these
depredations
and
that
with
a
considerable
increase
of
our
force
upon
that
frontier
and
the
establishment
of
several
additional
military
posts
along
the
rio
grande
so
as
more
effectually
to
guard
that
extensive
border
peace
may
be
preserved
and
the
lives
and
property
of
our
citizens
in
texas
fully
protected
prior
to
the
st
day
of
july
last
the
army
was
in
accordance
with
law
reduced
to
the
maximum
of
enlisted
men
being
a
reduction
of
below
the
force
previously
authorized
this
reduction
was
made
as
required
by
law
entirely
from
the
infantry
and
artillery
branches
of
the
service
without
any
reduction
of
the
cavalry
under
the
law
as
it
now
stands
it
is
necessary
that
the
cavalry
regiments
be
recruited
to
men
in
each
company
for
service
on
the
mexican
and
indian
frontiers
the
necessary
effect
of
this
legislation
is
to
reduce
the
infantry
and
artillery
arms
of
the
service
below
the
number
required
for
efficiency
and
i
concur
with
the
secretary
of
war
in
recommending
that
authority
be
given
to
recruit
all
companies
of
infantry
to
at
least
men
and
all
batteries
of
artillery
to
at
least
men
with
the
power
in
case
of
emergency
to
increase
the
former
to
and
the
latter
to
men
each
i
invite
your
special
attention
to
the
following
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
war
first
that
provision
be
made
for
supplying
to
the
army
a
more
abundant
and
better
supply
of
reading
matter
second
that
early
action
be
taken
by
congress
looking
to
a
complete
revision
and
republication
of
the
army
regulations
third
that
section
of
the
revised
statutes
limiting
the
number
of
officers
on
the
retired
list
be
repealed
fourth
that
the
claims
arising
under
the
act
of
july
for
supplies
taken
by
the
army
during
the
war
be
taken
from
the
offices
of
the
quartermaster
and
commissary
generals
and
transferred
to
the
southern
claims
commission
or
some
other
tribunal
having
more
time
and
better
facilities
for
their
prompt
investigation
and
decision
than
are
possessed
by
these
officers
fifth
that
congress
provide
for
an
annuity
fund
for
the
families
of
deceased
soldiers
as
recommended
by
the
paymastergeneral
of
the
army
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
that
we
have
six
squadrons
now
engaged
in
the
protection
of
our
foreign

other
duties
pertaining
to
the

appropriations
from

general
treasury
for
various
purposes
making
the

to

from
official
postage
stamps

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
submitting
my
eighth
and
last
annual
message
to
congress
it
seems
proper
that
i
should
refer
to
and
in
some
degree
recapitulate
the
events
and
official
acts
of
the
past
eight
years
it
was
my
fortune
or
misfortune
to
be
called
to
the
office
of
chief
executive
without
any
previous
political
training
from
the
age
of
i
had
never
even
witnessed
the
excitement
attending
a
presidential
campaign
but
twice
antecedent
to
my
own
candidacy
and
at
but
one
of
them
was
i
eligible
as
a
voter
under
such
circumstances
it
is
but
reasonable
to
suppose
that
errors
of
judgment
must
have
occurred
even
had
they
not
differences
of
opinion
between
the
executive
bound
by
an
oath
to
the
strict
performance
of
his
duties
and
writers
and
debaters
must
have
arisen
it
is
not
necessarily
evidence
of
blunder
on
the
part
of
the
executive
because
there
are
these
differences
of
views
mistakes
have
been
made
as
all
can
see
and
i
admit
but
it
seems
to
me
oftener
in
the
selections
made
of
the
assistants
appointed
to
aid
in
carrying
out
the
various
duties
of
administering
the
governmentin
nearly
every
case
selected
without
a
personal
acquaintance
with
the
appointee
but
upon
recommendations
of
the
representatives
chosen
directly
by
the
people
it
is
impossible
where
so
many
trusts
are
to
be
allotted
that
the
right
parties
should
be
chosen
in
every
instance
history
shows
that
no
administration
from
the
time
of
washington
to
the
present
has
been
free
from
these
mistakes
but
i
leave
comparisons
to
history
claiming
only
that
i
have
acted
in
every
instance
from
a
conscientious
desire
to
do
what
was
right
constitutional
within
the
law
and
for
the
very
best
interests
of
the
whole
people
failures
have
been
errors
of
judgment
not
of
intent
my
civil
career
commenced
too
at
a
most
critical
and
difficult
time
less
than
four
years
before
the
country
had
emerged
from
a
conflict
such
as
no
other
nation
had
ever
survived
nearly
onehalf
of
the
states
had
revolted
against
the
government
and
of
those
remaining
faithful
to
the
union
a
large
percentage
of
the
population
sympathized
with
the
rebellion
and
made
an
enemy
in
the
rear
almost
as
dangerous
as
the
more
honorable
enemy
in
the
front
the
latter
committed
errors
of
judgment
but
they
maintained
them
openly
and
courageously
the
former
received
the
protection
of
the
government
they
would
see
destroyed
and
reaped
all
the
pecuniary
advantage
to
be
gained
out
of
the
then
existing
state
of
affairs
many
of
them
by
obtaining
contracts
and
by
swindling
the
government
in
the
delivery
of
their
goods
immediately
on
the
cessation
of
hostilities
the
then
noble
president
who
had
carried
the
country
so
far
through
its
perils
fell
a
martyr
to
his
patriotism
at
the
hands
of
an
assassin
the
intervening
time
to
my
first
inauguration
was
filled
up
with
wranglings
between
congress
and
the
new
executive
as
to
the
best
mode
of
reconstruction
or
to
speak
plainly
as
to
whether
the
control
of
the
government
should
be
thrown
immediately
into
the
hands
of
those
who
had
so
recently
and
persistently
tried
to
destroy
it
or
whether
the
victors
should
continue
to
have
an
equal
voice
with
them
in
this
control
reconstruction
as
finally
agreed
upon
means
this
and
only
this
except
that
the
late
slave
was
enfranchised
giving
an
increase
as
was
supposed
to
the
unionloving
and
unionsupporting
votes
if
free
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
they
would
not
disappoint
this
expectation
hence
at
the
beginning
of
my
first
administration
the
work
of
reconstruction
much
embarrassed
by
the
long
delay
virtually
commenced
it
was
the
work
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
my
province
was
wholly
in
approving
their
acts
which
i
did
most
heartily
urging
the
legislatures
of
states
that
had
not
yet
done
so
to
ratify
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
the
country
was
laboring
under
an
enormous
debt
contracted
in
the
suppression
of
rebellion
and
taxation
was
so
oppressive
as
to
discourage
production
another
danger
also
threatened
usa
foreign
war
the
last
difficulty
had
to
be
adjusted
and
was
adjusted
without
a
war
and
in
a
manner
highly
honorable
to
all
parties
concerned
taxes
have
been
reduced
within
the
last
seven
years
nearly
and
the
national
debt
has
been
reduced
in
the
same
time
over
by
refunding
the
per
cent
bonded
debt
for
bonds
bearing
and
per
cent
interest
respectively
the
annual
interest
has
been
reduced
from
over
in
to
but
little
over
in
the
balance
of
trade
has
been
changed
from
over
against
the
united
states
in
to
more
than
in
our
favor
in
it
is
confidently
believed
that
the
balance
of
trade
in
favor
of
the
united
states
will
increase
not
diminish
and
that
the
pledge
of
congress
to
resume
specie
payments
in
will
be
easily
accomplished
even
in
the
absence
of
muchdesired
further
legislation
on
the
subject
a
policy
has
been
adopted
toward
the
indian
tribes
inhabiting
a
large
portion
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states
which
has
been
humane
and
has
substantially
ended
indian
hostilities
in
the
whole
land
except
in
a
portion
of
nebraska
and
dakota
wyoming
and
montana
territoriesthe
black
hills
region
and
approaches
thereto
hostilities
there
have
grown
out
of
the
avarice
of
the
white
man
who
has
violated
our
treaty
stipulations
in
his
search
for
gold
the
question
might
be
asked
why
the
government
has
not
enforced
obedience
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
prohibiting
the
occupation
of
the
black
hills
region
by
whites
the
answer
is
simple
the
first
immigrants
to
the
black
hills
were
removed
by
troops
but
rumors
of
rich
discoveries
of
gold
took
into
that
region
increased
numbers
gold
has
actually
been
found
in
paying
quantity
and
an
effort
to
remove
the
miners
would
only
result
in
the
desertion
of
the
bulk
of
the
troops
that
might
be
sent
there
to
remove
them
all
difficulty
in
this
matter
has
however
been
removedsubject
to
the
approval
of
congressby
a
treaty
ceding
the
black
hills
and
approaches
to
settlement
by
citizens
the
subject
of
indian
policy
and
treatment
is
so
fully
set
forth
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
my
views
so
fully
expressed
therein
that
i
refer
to
their
reports
and
recommendations
as
my
own
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
foreign
powers
continue
on
a
friendly
footing
questions
have
arisen
from
time
to
time
in
the
foreign
relations
of
the
government
but
the
united
states
have
been
happily
free
during
the
past
year
from
the
complications
and
embarrassments
which
have
surrounded
some
of
the
foreign
powers
the
diplomatic
correspondence
submitted
herewith
contains
information
as
to
certain
of
the
matters
which
have
occupied
the
government
the
cordiality
which
attends
our
relations
with
the
powers
of
the
earth
has
been
plainly
shown
by
the
general
participation
of
foreign
nations
in
the
exhibition
which
has
just
closed
and
by
the
exertions
made
by
distant
powers
to
show
their
interest
in
and
friendly
feelings
toward
the
united
states
in
the
commemoration
of
the
centennial
of
the
nation
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
have
not
only
fully
appreciated
this
exhibition
of
kindly
feeling
but
it
may
be
justly
and
fairly
expected
that
no
small
benefits
will
result
both
to
ourselves
and
other
nations
from
a
better
acquaintance
and
a
better
appreciation
of
our
mutual
advantages
and
mutual
wants
congress
at
its
last
session
saw
fit
to
reduce
the
amount
usually
appropriated
for
foreign
intercourse
by
withholding
appropriations
for
representatives
of
the
united
states
in
certain
foreign
countries
and
for
certain
consular
officers
and
by
reducing
the
amounts
usually
appropriated
for
certain
other
diplomatic
posts
and
thus
necessitating
a
change
in
the
grade
of
the
representatives
for
these
reasons
immediately
upon
the
passage
of
the
bill
making
appropriations
for
the
diplomatic
and
consular
service
for
the
present
fiscal
year
instructions
were
issued
to
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
at
bolivia
ecuador
and
colombia
and
to
the
consular
officers
for
whom
no
appropriation
had
been
made
to
close
their
respective
legations
and
consulates
and
cease
from
the
performance
of
their
duties
and
in
like
manner
steps
were
immediately
taken
to
substitute
charges
daffaires
for
ministers
resident
in
portugal
denmark
greece
switzerland
and
paraguay
while
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
wisdom
of
sound
economy
in
the
foreign
service
as
in
other
branches
of
the
government
i
can
not
escape
the
conclusion
that
in
some
instances
the
withholding
of
appropriations
will
prove
an
expensive
economy
and
that
the
small
retrenchment
secured
by
a
change
of
grade
in
certain
diplomatic
posts
is
not
an
adequate
consideration
for
the
loss
of
influence
and
importance
which
will
attend
our
foreign
representatives
under
this
reduction
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
a
reexamination
of
the
subject
will
cause
a
change
in
some
instances
in
the
conclusions
reached
on
these
subjects
at
the
last
session
of
congress
the
court
of
commissioners
of
alabama
claims
whose
functions
were
continued
by
an
act
of
the
last
session
of
congress
until
the
st
day
of
january
has
carried
on
its
labors
with
diligence
and
general
satisfaction
by
a
report
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
transmitted
herewith
bearing
date
november
it
appears
that
within
the
time
now
allowed
by
law
the
court
will
have
disposed
of
all
the
claims
presented
for
adjudication
this
report
also
contains
a
statement
of
the
general
results
of
the
labors
of
the
court
to
the
date
thereof
it
is
a
cause
of
satisfaction
that
the
method
adopted
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
classes
of
claims
submitted
to
the
court
which
are
of
long
standing
and
justly
entitled
to
early
consideration
should
have
proved
successful
and
acceptable
it
is
with
satisfaction
that
i
am
enabled
to
state
that
the
work
of
the
joint
commission
for
determining
the
boundary
line
between
the
united

and
british
possessions
from
the
northwest

a
statement

the
condition

the
questions
which
lately
arose
with
great
britain
respecting
the
surrender
of
fugitive
criminals
under
the
treaty
of
the
ottoman
government
gave
notice
under
date
of

of
its
desire
to
terminate
the
treaty
of
concerning
commerce
and
navigation
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
twentysecond
article
thereof
under
this
notice
the
treaty
terminated
upon
the
th
day
of

that
government
has
invited
negotiations
toward
the
conclusion
of
a
new
treaty
by
the
act
of
congress
of
march
the
president
was
authorized
when
he
should
receive
satisfactory
information
that
the
ottoman
government
or
that
of
egypt
had
organized
new
tribunals
likely
to
secure
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
same
impartial
justice
enjoyed
under
the
exercise
of
judicial
functions
by
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
of
the
united
states
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
act
of
june
and
to
accept
for
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
jurisdiction
of
the
new
tribunals
satisfactory
information
having
been
received
of
the
organization
of
such
new
tribunals
in
egypt
i
caused
a
proclamation
to
be
issued
upon
the
th
of
march
last
suspending
the
operation
of
the
act
of
june
in
egypt
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
accompanies
this
message
the
united
states
has
united
with
the
other
powers
in
the
organization
of
these
courts
it
is
hoped
that
the
jurisdictional
questions
which
have
arisen
may
be
readily
adjusted
and
that
this
advance
in
judicial
reform
may
be
hindered
by
no
obstacles
the
necessary
legislation
to
carry
into
effect
the
convention
respecting
commercial
reciprocity
concluded
with
the
hawaiian
islands
in
having
been
had
the
proclamation
to
carry
into
effect
the
convention
as
provided
by
the
act
approved
august
was
duly
issued
upon
the
th
day
of
september
last
a
copy
thereof
accompanies
this
message
the
commotions
which
have
been
prevalent
in
mexico
for
some
time
past
and
which
unhappily
seem
to
be
not
yet
wholly
quieted
have
led
to
complaints
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
injuries
by
persons
in
authority
it
is
hoped
however
that
these
will
ultimately
be
adjusted
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
governments
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
in
that
quarter
has
not
been
exempt
from
acts
of
violence
by
citizens
of
one
republic
on
those
of
the
other
the
frequency
of
these
is
supposed
to
be
increased
and
their
adjustment
made
more
difficult
by
the
considerable
changes
in
the
course
of
the
lower
part
of
the
rio
grande
river
which
river
is
a
part
of
the
boundary
between
the
two
countries
these
changes
have
placed
on
either
side
of
that
river
portions
of
land
which
by
existing
conventions
belong
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
government
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
the
subject
of
adjustment
of
this
cause
of
difficulty
is
under
consideration
between
the
two
republics
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
colombia
has
paid
the
award
in
the
case
of
the
steamer
montijo
seized
by
authorities
of
that
government
some
years
since
and
the
amount
has
been
transferred
to
the
claimants
it
is
with
satisfaction
that
i
am
able
to
announce
that
the
joint
commission
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
under
the
convention
of
the
duration
of
which
has
been
several
times
extended
has
brought
its
labors
to
a
close
from
the
report
of
the
agent
of
the
united
states
which
accompanies
the
papers
transmitted
herewith
it
will
be
seen
that
within
the
time
limited
by
the
commission
claims
on
the
part
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
mexico
were
referred
to
the
commission
of
these
claims
were
dismissed
or
disallowed
and
in
cases
awards
were
made
in
favor
of
the
claimants
against
the
mexican
republic
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
within
the
same
period
claims
on
the
part
of
citizens
of
the
mexican
republic
against
the
united
states
were
referred
to
the
commission
of
these
claims
were
dismissed
or
disallowed
and
in
cases
awards
were
made
in
favor
of
the
claimants
against
the
united
states
amounting
in
the
aggregate
to
by
the
terms
of
the
convention
the
amount
of
these
awards
is
to
be
deducted
from
the
amount
awarded
in
favor
of
our
citizens
against
mexico
and
the
balance
only
to
be
paid
by
mexico
to
the
united
states
leaving
the
united
states
to
make
provision
for
this
proportion
of
the
awards
in
favor
of
its
own
citizens
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
legislation
which
will
be
necessary
to
provide
for
the
payment
in
this
connection
i
am
pleased
to
be
able
to
express
the
acknowledgments
due
to
sir
edward
thornton
the
umpire
of
the
commission
who
has
given
to
the
consideration
of
the
large
number
of
claims
submitted
to
him
much
time
unwearied
patience
and
that
firmness
and
intelligence
which
are
well
known
to
belong
to
the
accomplished
representative
of
great
britain
and
which
are
likewise
recognized
by
the
representative
in
this
country
of
the
republic
of
mexico
monthly
payments
of
a
very
small
part
of
the
amount
due
by
the
government
of
venezuela
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
on
account
of
claims
of
the
latter
against
that
government
continue
to
be
made
with
reasonable
punctuality
that
government
has
proposed
to
change
the
system
which
it
has
hitherto
pursued
in
this
respect
by
issuing
bonds
for
part
of
the
amount
of
the
several
claims
the
proposition
however
could
not
it
is
supposed
properly
be
accepted
at
least
without
the
consent
of
the
holders
of
certificates
of
the
indebtedness
of
venezuela
these
are
so
much
dispersed
that
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
ascertain
their
disposition
on
the
subject
in
former
messages
i
have
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
necessity
of
legislation
with
regard
to
fraudulent
naturalization
and
to
the
subject
of
expatriation
and
the
election
of
nationality
the
numbers
of
persons
of
foreign
birth
seeking
a
home
in
the
united
states
the
ease
and
facility
with
which
the
honest
emigrant
may
after
the
lapse
of
a
reasonable
time
become
possessed
of
all
the
privileges
of
citizenship
of
the
united
states
and
the
frequent
occasions
which
induce
such
adopted
citizens
to
return
to
the
country
of
their
birth
render
the
subject
of
naturalization
and
the
safeguards
which
experience
has
proved
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
honest
naturalized
citizen
of
paramount
importance
the
very
simplicity
in
the
requirements
of
law
on
this
question
affords
opportunity
for
fraud
and
the
want
of
uniformity
in
the
proceedings
and
records
of
the
various
courts
and
in
the
forms
of
the
certificates
of
naturalization
issued
affords
a
constant
source
of
difficulty
i
suggest
no
additional
requirements
to
the
acquisition
of
citizenship
beyond
those
now
existing
but
i
invite
the
earnest
attention
of
congress
to
the
necessity
and
wisdom
of
some
provisions
regarding
uniformity
in
the
records
and
certificates
and
providing
against
the
frauds
which
frequently
take
place
and
for
the
vacating
of
a
record
of
naturalization
obtained
in
fraud
these
provisions
are
needed
in
aid
and
for
the
protection
of
the
honest
citizen
of
foreign
birth
and
for
the
want
of
which
he
is
made
to
suffer
not
infrequently
the
united
states
has
insisted
upon
the
right
of
expatriation
and
has
obtained
after
a
long
struggle
an
admission
of
the
principle
contended
for
by
acquiescence
therein
on
the
part
of
many
foreign
powers
and
by
the
conclusion
of
treaties
on
that
subject
it
is
however
but
justice
to
the
government
to
which
such
naturalized
citizens
have
formerly
owed
allegiance
as
well
as
to
the
united
states
that
certain
fixed
and
definite
rules
should
be
adopted
governing
such
cases
and
providing
how
expatriation
may
be
accomplished
while
emigrants
in
large
numbers
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
it
is
also
true
that
persons
both
native
born
and
naturalized
once
citizens
of
the
united
states
either
by
formal
acts
or
as
the
effect
of
a
series
of
facts
and
circumstances
abandon
their
citizenship
and
cease
to
be
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
united
states
but
continue
on
convenient
occasions
to
assert
a
claim
to
protection
in
the
absence
of
provisions
on
these
questions
and
in
this
connection
i
again
invite
your
attention
to
the
necessity
of
legislation
concerning
the
marriages
of
american
citizens
contracted
abroad
and
concerning
the
status
of
american
women
who
may
marry
foreigners
and
of
children
born
of
american
parents
in
a
foreign
country
the
delicate
and
complicated
questions
continually
occurring
with
reference
to
naturalization
expatriation
and
the
status
of
such
persons
as
i
have
above
referred
to
induce
me
to
earnestly
direct
your
attention
again
to
these
subjects
in
like
manner
i
repeat
my
recommendation
that
some
means
be
provided
for
the
hearing
and
determination
of
the
just
and
subsisting
claims
of
aliens
upon
the
government
of
the
united
states
within
a
reasonable
limitation
and
of
s
uch
as
may
hereafter
arise
while
by
existing
provisions
of
law
the
court
of
claims
may
in
certain
cases
be
resorted
to
by
an
alien
claimant
the
absence
of
any
general
provisions
governing
all
such
cases
and
the
want
of
a
tribunal
skilled
in
the
disposition
of
such
cases
upon
recognized
fixed
and
settled
principles
either
provides
no
remedy
in
many
deserving
cases
or
compels
a
consideration
of
such
claims
by
congress
or
the
executive
department
of
the
government
it
is
believed
that
other
governments
are
in
advance
of
the
united
states
upon
this
question
and
that
the
practice
now
adopted
is
entirely
unsatisfactory
congress
by
an
act
approved
the
d
day
of
march
authorized
the
inhabitants
of
the
territory
of
colorado
to
form
a
state
government
with
the
name
of
the
state
of
colorado
and
therein
provided
for
the
admission
of
said
state
when
formed
into
the
union
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
a
constitution
having
been
adopted
and
ratified
by
the
people
of
that
state
and
the
acting
governor
having
certified
to
me
the
facts
as
provided
by
said
act
together
with
a
copy
of
such
constitution
and
ordinances
as
provided
for
in
the
said
act
and
the
provisions
of
the
said
act
of
congress
having
been
duly
complied
with
i
issued
a
proclamation
upon
the
st
of
august
a
copy
of
which
is
hereto
annexed
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
shows
that
the
army
has
been
actively
employed
during
the
year
in
subduing
at
the
request
of
the
indian
bureau
certain
wild
bands
of
the
sioux
indian
nation
and
in
preserving
the
peace
at
the
south
during
the
election
the
commission
constituted
under
the
act
of
july
to
consider
and
report
on
the
whole
subject
of
the
reform
and
reorganization
of
the
army
met
in
august
last
and
has
collected
a
large
mass
of
statistics
and
opinions
bearing
on
the
subject
before
it
these
are
now
under
consideration
and
their
report
is
progressing
i
am
advised
though
by
the
president
of
the
commission
that
it
will
be
impracticable
to
comply
with
the
clause
of
the
act
requiring
the
report
to
be
presented
through
me
to
congress
on
the
first
day
of
this
session
as
there
has
not
yet
been
time
for
that
mature
deliberation
which
the
importance
of
the
subject
demands
therefore
i
ask
that
the
time
of
making
the
report
be
extended
to
the
th
day
of
january
in
accordance
with
the
resolution
of
august
the
army
regulations
prepared
under
the
act
of
march
have
not
been
promulgated
but
are
held
until
after
the
report
of
the
abovementioned
commission
shall
have
been
received
and
acted
on
by
the
act
of
august
the
cavalry
force
of
the
army
was
increased
by
men
with
the
proviso
that
they
should
be
discharged
on
the
expiration
of
hostilities
under
this
authority
the
cavalry
regiments
have
been
strengthened
and
a
portion
of
them
are
now
in
the
field
pursuing
the
remnants
of
the
indians
with
whom
they
have
been
engaged
during
the
summer
the
estimates
of
the
war
department
are
made
up
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
men
authorized
by
law
and
their
requirements
as
shown
by
years
of
experience
and
also
with
the
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
bureau
officers
to
provide
for
all
contingencies
that
may
arise
during
the
time
for
which
the
estimates
are
made
exclusive
of
engineer
estimates
presented
in
accordance
with
acts
of
congress
calling
for
surveys
and
estimates
for
improvements
at
various
localities
the
estimates
now
presented
are
about
six
millions
in
excess
of
the
appropriations
for
the
years
and
this
increase
is
asked
in
order
to
provide
for
the
increased
cavalry
force
should
their
services
be
necessary
to
prosecute
economically
work
upon
important
public
buildings
to
provide
for
armament
of
fortifications
and
manufacture
of
small
arms
and
to
replenish
the
working
stock
in
the
supply
departments
the
appropriations
for
these
last
named
have
for
the
past
few
years
been
so
limited
that
the
accumulations
in
store
will
be
entirely
exhausted
during
the
present
year
and
it
will
be
necessary
to
at
once
begin
to
replenish
them
i
invite
your
special
attention
to
the
following
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
war
first
that
the
claims
under
the
act
of
july
for
supplies
taken
by
the
army
during
the
war
be
removed
from
the
offices
of
the
quartermaster
and
commissary
generals
and
transferred
to
the
southern
claims
commission
these
claims
are
of
precisely
similar
nature
to
those
now
before
the
southern
claims
commission
and
the
war
department
bureaus
have
not
the
clerical
force
for
their
examination
nor
proper
machinery
for
investigating
the
loyalty
of
the
claimants
second
that
congress
sanction
the
scheme
of
an
annuity
fund
for
the
benefit
of
the
families
of
deceased
officers
and
that
it
also
provide
for
the
permanent
organization
of
the
signal
service
both
of
which
were
recommended
in
my
last
annual
message
third
that
the
manufacturing
operations
of
the
ordnance
department
be
concentrated
at
three
arsenals
and
an
armory
and
that
the
remaining
arsenals
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
applied
to
this
object
by
the
ordnance
department
the
appropriations
for
river
and
harbor
improvements
for
the
current
year
were
with
my
approval
the
secretary
of
war
directed
that
of
this
amount
should
be
expended
and
no
new
works
should
be
begun
and
none
prosecuted
which
were
not
of
national
importance
subsequently
this
amount
was
increased
to
and
the
works
are
now
progressing
on
this
basis
the
improvement
of
the
south
pass
of
the
mississippi
river
under
james
b
eads
and
his
associates
is
progressing
favorably
at
the
present
time
there
is
a
channel
of
feet
in
depth
between
the
jetties
at
the
mouth
of
the
pass
and
feet
at
the
head
of
the
pass
neither
channel
however
has
the
width
required
before
payments
can
be
made
by
the
united
states
a
commission
of
engineer
officers
is
now
examining
these
works
and
their
reports
will
be
presented
as
soon
as
received
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
that
branch
of
the
service
to
be
in
condition
as
effective
as
it
is
possible
to
keep
it
with
the
means
and
authority
given
the
department
it
is
of
course
not
possible
to
rival
the
costly
and
progressive
establishments
of
great
european
powers
with
the
old
material
of
our
navy
to
which
no
increase
has
been
authorized
since
the
war
except
the
eight
small
cruisers
built
to
supply
the
place
of
others
which
had
gone
to
decay
yet
the
most
has
been
done
that
was
possible
with
the
means
at
command
and
by
substantially
rebuilding
some
of
our
old
ships
with
durable
material
and
completely
repairing
and
refitting
our
monitor
fleet
the
navy
has
been
gradually
so
brought
up
that
though
it
does
not
maintain
its
relative
position
among
the
progressive
navies
of
the
world
it
is
now
in
a
condition
more
powerful
and
effective
than
it
ever
has
been
in
time
of
peace
the
complete
repairs
of
our
five
heavy
ironclads
are
only
delayed
on
account
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
appropriations
made
last
year
for
the
working
bureaus
of
the
department
which
were
actually
less
in
amount
than
those
made
before
the
war
notwithstanding
the
greatly
enhanced
price
of
labor
and
materials
and
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
naval
service
growing
out
of
the
universal
use
and
great
expense
of
steam
machinery
the
money
necessary
for
these
repairs
should
be
provided
at
once
that
they
may
be
completed
without
further
unnecessary
delay
and
expense
when
this
is
done
all
the
strength
that
there
is
in
our
navy
will
be
developed
and
useful
to
its
full
capacity
and
it
will
be
powerful
for
purposes
of
defense
and
also
for
offensive
action
should
the
necessity
for
that
arise
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
our
shores
the
fact
that
our
navy
is
not
more
modern
and
powerful
than
it
is
has
been
made
a
cause
of
complaint
against
the
secretary
of
the
navy
by
persons
who
at
the
same
time
criticise
and
complain
of
his
endeavors
to
bring
the
navy
that
we
have
to
its
best
and
most
efficient
condition
but
the
good
sense
of
the
country
will
understand
that
it
is
really
due
to
his
practical
action
that
we
have
at
this
time
any
effective
naval
force
at
command
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
shows
the
excess
of
expenditures
excluding
expenditures
on
account
of
previous
years
over
receipts
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
to
be
estimated
expenditures
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
are
estimated
revenue
for
same
period
is
leaving
estimated
excess
of
expenditure
to
be
appropriated
as
a
deficiency
of
the
postmastergeneral
like
his
predecessor
is
convinced
that
a
change
in
the
basis
of
adjusting
the
salaries
of
postmasters
of
the
fourth
class
is
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
service
as
well
as
for
the
interests
of
the
government
and
urgently
recommends
that
the
compensation
of
the
class
of
postmasters
above
mentioned
be
based
upon
the
business
of
their
respective
offices
as
ascertained
from
the
sworn
returns
to
the
auditor
of
stamps
canceled
a
few
postmasters
in
the
southern
states
have
expressed
great
apprehension
of
their
personal
safety
on
account
of
their
connection
with
the
postal
service
and
have
specially
requested
that
their
reports
of
apprehended
danger
should
not
be
made
public
lest
it
should
result
in
the
loss
of
their
lives
but
no
positive
testimony
of
interference
has
been
submitted
except
in
the
case
of
a
mail
messenger
at
spartanburg
in
south
carolina
who
reported
that
he
had
been
violently
driven
away
while
in
charge
of
the
mails
on
account
of
his
political
affiliations
an
assistant
superintendent
of
the
railway
mail
service
investigated
this
case
and
reported
that
the
messenger
had
disappeared
from
his
post
leaving
his
work
to
be
performed
by
a
substitute
the
postmastergeneral
thinks
this
case
is
sufficiently
suggestive
to
justify
him
in
recommending
that
a
more
severe
punishment
should
be
provided
for
the
offense
of
assaulting
any
person
in
charge
of
the
mails
or
of
retarding
or
otherwise
obstructing
them
by
threats
of
personal
injury
a
very
gratifying
result
is
presented
in
the
fact
that
the
deficiency
of
this
department
during
the
last
fiscal
year
was
reduced
to
as
against
of
the
preceding
year
the
difference
can
be
tra
ced
to
the
large
increase
in
its
ordinary
receipts
which
greatly
exceed
the
estimates
therefor
and
a
slight
decrease
in
its
expenditures
the
ordinary
receipts
of
the
postoffice
department
for
the
past
seven
fiscal
years
have
increased
at
an
average
of
over
per
cent
per
annum
while
the
increase
of
expenditures
for
the
same
period
has
been
but
about
per
cent
per
annum
and
the
decrease
of
deficiency
in
the
revenues
has
been
at
the
rate
of
nearly
per
cent
per
annum
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
accompanying
this
message
will
be
found
one
of
great
interest
marking
as
it
does
the
great
progress
of
the
last
century
in
the
variety
of
products
of
the
soil
increased
knowledge
and
skill
in
the
labor
of
producing
saving
and
manipulating
the
same
to
prepare
them
for
the
use
of
man
in
the
improvements
in
machinery
to
aid
the
agriculturist
in
his
labors
and
in
a
knowledge
of
those
scientific
subjects
necessary
to
a
thorough
system
of
economy
in
agricultural
production
namely
chemistry
botany
entomology
etc
a
study
of
this
report
by
those
interested
in
agriculture
and
deriving
their
support
from
it
will
find
it
of
value
in
pointing
out
those
articles
which
are
raised
in
greater
quantity
than
the
needs
of
the
world
require
and
must
sell
therefore
for
less
than
the
cost
of
production
and
those
which
command
a
profit
over
cost
of
production
because
there
is
not
an
overproduction
i
call
special
attention
to
the
need
of
the
department
for
a
new
gallery
for
the
reception
of
the
exhibits
returned
from
the
centennial
exhibition
including
the
exhibits
donated
by
very
many
foreign
nations
and
to
the
recommendations
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
generally
the
reports
of
the
district
commissioners
and
the
board
of
health
are
just
receivedtoo
late
to
read
them
and
to
make
recommendations
thereonand
are
herewith
submitted
the
international
exhibition
held
in
philadelphia
this
year
in
commemoration
of
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
american
independence
has
proven
a
great
success
and
will
no
doubt
be
of
enduring
advantage
to
the
country
it
has
shown
the
great
progress
in
the
arts
sciences
and
mechanical
skill
made
in
a
single
century
and
demonstrated
that
we
are
but
little
behind
older
nations
in
any
one
branch
while
in
some
we
scarcely
have
a
rival
it
has
served
too
not
only
to
bring
peoples
and
products
of
skill
and
labor
from
all
parts
of
the
world
together
but
in
bringing
together
people
from
all
sections
of
our
own
country
which
must
prove
a
great
benefit
in
the
information
imparted
and
pride
of
country
engendered
it
has
been
suggested
by
scientists
interested
in
and
connected
with
the
smithsonian
institution
in
a
communication
herewith
that
the
government
exhibit
be
removed
to
the
capital
and
a
suitable
building
be
erected
or
purchased
for
its
accommodation
as
a
permanent
exhibit
i
earnestly
recommend
this
and
believing
that
congress
would
second
this
view
i
directed
that
all
government
exhibits
at
the
centennial
exhibition
should
remain
where
they
are
except
such
as
might
be
injured
by
remaining
in
a
building
not
intended
as
a
protection
in
inclement
weather
or
such
as
may
be
wanted
by
the
department
furnishing
them
until
the
question
of
permanent
exhibition
is
acted
on
although
the
moneys
appropriated
by
congress
to
enable
the
participation
of
the
several
executive
departments
in
the
international
exhibition
of
were
not
sufficient
to
carry
out
the
undertaking
to
the
full
extent
at
first
contemplated
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
refer
to
the
very
efficient
and
creditable
manner
in
which
the
board
appointed
from
these
several
departments
to
provide
an
exhibition
on
the
part
of
the
government
have
discharged
their
duties
with
the
funds
placed
at
their
command
without
a
precedent
to
guide
them
in
the
preparation
of
such
a
display
the
success
of
their
labors
was
amply
attested
by
the
sustained
attention
which
the
contents
of
the
government
building
attracted
during
the
period
of
the
exhibition
from
both
foreign
and
native
visitors
i
am
strongly
impressed
with
the
value
of
the
collection
made
by
the
government
for
the
purposes
of
the
exhibition
illustrating
as
it
does
the
mineral
resources
of
the
country
the
statistical
and
practical
evidences
of
our
growth
as
a
nation
and
the
uses
of
the
mechanical
arts
and
the
applications
of
applied
science
in
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
government
many
nations
have
voluntarily
contributed
their
exhibits
to
the
united
states
to
increase
the
interest
in
any
permanent
exhibition
congress
may
provide
for
for
this
act
of
generosity
they
should
receive
the
thanks
of
the
people
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
resolution
of
congress
to
that
effect
be
adopted
the
attention
of
congress
can
not
be
too
earnestly
called
to
the
necessity
of
throwing
some
greater
safeguard
over
the
method
of
choosing
and
declaring
the
election
of
a
president
under
the
present
system
there
seems
to
be
no
provided
remedy
for
contesting
the
election
in
any
one
state
the
remedy
is
partially
no
doubt
in
the
enlightenment
of
electors
the
compulsory
support
of
the
free
school
and
the
disfranchisement
of
all
who
can
not
read
and
write
the
english
language
after
a
fixed
probation
would
meet
my
hearty
approval
i
would
not
make
this
apply
however
to
those
already
voters
but
i
would
to
all
becoming
so
after
the
expiration
of
the
probation
fixed
upon
foreigners
coming
to
this
country
to
become
citizens
who
are
educated
in
their
own
language
should
acquire
the
requisite
knowledge
of
ours
during
the
necessary
residence
to
obtain
naturalization
if
they
did
not
take
interest
enough
in
our
language
to
acquire
sufficient
knowledge
of
it
to
enable
them
to
study
the
institutions
and
laws
of
the
country
intelligently
i
would
not
confer
upon
them
the
right
to
make
such
laws
nor
to
select
those
who
do
i
append
to
this
message
for
convenient
reference
a
synopsis
of
administrative
events
and
of
all
recommendations
to
congress
made
by
me
during
the
last
seven
years
time
may
show
some
of
these
recommendations
not
to
have
been
wisely
conceived
but
i
believe
the
larger
part
will
do
no
discredit
to
the
administration
one
of
these
recommendations
met
with
the
united
opposition
of
one
political
party
in
the
senate
and
with
a
strong
opposition
from
the
other
namely
the
treaty
for
the
annexation
of
santo
domingo
to
the
united
states
to
which
i
will
specially
refer
maintaining
as
i
do
that
if
my
views
had
been
concurred
in
the
country
would
be
in
a
more
prosperous
condition
today
both
politically
and
financially
santo
domingo
is
fertile
and
upon
its
soil
may
be
grown
just
those
tropical
products
of
which
the
united
states
use
so
much
and
which
are
produced
or
prepared
for
market
now
by
slave
labor
almost
exclusively
namely
sugar
coffee
dyewoods
mahogany
tropical
fruits
tobacco
etc
about
per
cent
of
the
exports
of
cuba
are
consumed
in
the
united
states
a
large
percentage
of
the
exports
of
brazil
also
find
the
same
market
these
are
paid
for
almost
exclusively
in
coin
legislation
particularly
in
cuba
being
unfavorable
to
a
mutual
exchange
of
the
products
of
each
country
flour
shipped
from
the
mississippi
river
to
havana
can
pass
by
the
very
entrance
to
the
city
on
its
way
to
a
port
in
spain
there
pay
a
duty
fixed
upon
articles
to
be
reexported
transferred
to
a
spanish
vessel
and
brought
back
almost
to
the
point
of
starting
paying
a
second
duty
and
still
leave
a
profit
over
what
would
be
received
by
direct
shipment
all
that
is
produced
in
cuba
could
be
produced
in
santo
domingo
being
a
part
of
the
united
states
commerce
between
the
island
and
mainland
would
be
free
there
would
be
no
export
duties
on
her
shipments
nor
import
duties
on
those
coming
here
there
would
be
no
import
duties
upon
the
supplies
machinery
etc
going
from
the
states
the
effect
that
would
have
been
produced
upon
cuban
commerce
with
these
advantages
to
a
rival
is
observable
at
a
glance
the
cuban
question
would
have
been
settled
long
ago
in
favor
of
free
cuba
hundreds
of
american
vessels
would
now
be
advantageously
used
in
transporting
the
valuable
woods
and
other
products
of
the
soil
of
the
island
to
a
market
and
in
carrying
supplies
and
emigrants
to
it
the
island
is
but
sparsely
settled
while
it
has
an
area
sufficient
for
the
profitable
employment
of
several
millions
of
people
the
soil
would
have
soon
fallen
into
the
hands
of
united
states
capitalists
the
products
are
so
valuable
in
commerce
that
emigration
there
would
have
been
encouraged
the
emancipated
race
of
the
south
would
have
found
there
a
congenial
home
where
their
civil
rights
would
not
be
disputed
and
where
their
labor
would
be
so
much
sought
after
that
the
poorest
among
them
could
have
found
the
means
to
go
thus
in
cases
of
great
oppression
and
cruelty
such
as
has
been
practiced
upon
them
in
many
places
within
the
last
eleven
years
whole
communities
would
have
sought
refuge
in
santo
domingo
i
do
not
suppose
the
whole
race
would
have
gone
nor
is
it
desirable
that
they
should
go
their
labor
is
desirableindispensable
almostwhere
they
now
are
but
the
possession
of
this
territory
would
have
left
the
negro
master
of
the
situation
by
enabling
him
to
demand
his
rights
at
home
on
pain
of
finding
them
elsewhere
i
do
not
present
these
views
now
as
a
recommendation
for
a
renewal
of
the
subject
of
annexation
but
i
do
refer
to
it
to
vindicate
my
previous
action
in
regard
to
it
with
the
present
term
of
congress
my
official
life
terminates
it
is
not
probable
that
public
affairs
will
ever
again
receive
attention
from
me
further
than
as
a
citizen
of
the
republic
always
taking
a
deep
interest
in
the
honor
integrity
and
prosperity
of
the
whole
land
u
s
grant

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
submitting
my
seventh
annual
message
to
congress
in
this
centennial
year
of
our
national
existence
as
a
free
and
independent
people
it
affords
me
great
pleasure
to
recur
to
the
advancement
that
has
been
made
from
the
time
of
the
colonies
one
hundred
years
ago
we
were
then
a
people
numbering
only
now
we
number
more
than
then
industries
were
confined
almost
exclusively
to
the
tillage
of
the
soil
now
manufactories
absorb
much
of
the
labor
of
the
country
our
liberties
remain
unimpaired
the
bondmen
have
been
freed
from
slavery
we
have
become
possessed
of
the
respect
if
not
the
friendship
of
all
civilized
nations
our
progress
has
been
great
in
all
the
artsin
science
agriculture
commerce
navigation
mining
mechanics
law
medicine
etc
and
in
general
education
the
progress
is
likewise
encouraging
our
thirteen
states
have
become
thirtyeight
including
colorado
which
has
taken
the
initiatory
steps
to
become
a
state
and
eight
territories
including
the
indian
territory
and
alaska
and
excluding
colorado
making
a
territory
extending
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
on
the
south
we
have
extended
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
in
the
west
from
the
mississippi
to
the
pacific
one
hundred
years
ago
the
cotton
gin
the
steamship
the
railroad
the
telegraph
the
reaping
sewing
and
modern
printing
machines
and
numerous
other
inventions
of
scarcely
less
value
to
our
business
and
happiness
were
entirely
unknown
in
manufactories
scarcely
existed
even
in
name
in
all
this
vast
territory
in
more
than
persons
were
employed
in
manufactories
producing
more
than
of
products
in
amount
annually
nearly
equal
to
our
national
debt
from
nearly
the
whole
of
the
population
of
being
engaged
in
the
one
occupation
of
agriculture
in
so
numerous
and
diversified
had
become
the
occupation
of
our
people
that
less
than
out
of
more
than
were
so
engaged
the
extraordinary
effect
produced
in
our
country
by
a
resort
to
diversified
occupations
has
built
a
market
for
the
products
of
fertile
lands
distant
from
the
seaboard
and
the
markets
of
the
world
the
american
system
of
locating
various
and
extensive
manufactories
next
to
the
plow
and
the
pasture
and
adding
connecting
railroads
and
steamboats
has
produced
in
our
distant
interior
country
a
result
noticeable
by
the
intelligent
portions
of
all
commercial
nations
the
ingenuity
and
skill
of
american
mechanics
have
been
demonstrated
at
home
and
abroad
in
a
manner
most
flattering
to
their
pride
but
for
the
extraordinary
genius
and
ability
of
our
mechanics
the
achievements
of
our
agriculturists
manufacturers
and
transporters
throughout
the
country
would
have
been
impossible
of
attainment
the
progress
of
the
miner
has
also
been
great
of
coal
our
production
has
small
now
many
millions
of
tons
are
mined
annually
so
with
iron
which
formed
scarcely
an
appreciable
part
of
our
products
half
a
century
ago
we
now
produce
more
than
the
world
consumed
at
the
beginning
of
our
national
existence
lead
zinc
and
copper
from
being
articles
of
import
we
may
expect
to
be
large
exporters
of
in
the
near
future
the
development
of
gold
and
silver
mines
in
the
united
states
and
territories
has
not
only
been
remarkable
but
has
had
a
large
influence
upon
the
business
of
all
commercial
nations
our
merchants
in
the
last
hundred
years
have
had
a
success
and
have
established
a
reputation
for
enterprise
sagacity
progress
and
integrity
unsurpassed
by
peoples
of
older
nationalities
this
good
name
is
not
confined
to
their
homes
but
goes
out
upon
every
sea
and
into
every
port
where
commerce
enters
with
equal
pride
we
can
point
to
our
progress
in
all
of
the
learned
professions
as
we
are
now
about
to
enter
upon
our
second
centennialcommenting
our
manhood
as
a
nationit
is
well
to
look
back
upon
the
past
and
study
what
will
be
best
to
preserve
and
advance
our
future
greatness
from
the
fall
of
adam
for
his
transgression
to
the
present
day
no
nation
has
ever
been
free
from
threatened
danger
to
its
prosperity
and
happiness
we
should
look
to
the
dangers
threatening
us
and
remedy
them
so
far
as
lies
in
our
power
we
are
a
republic
whereof
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
before
the
law
under
such
a
form
of
government
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
that
all
should
be
possessed
of
education
and
intelligence
enough
to
cast
a
vote
with
a
right
understanding
of
its
meaning
a
large
association
of
ignorant
men
can
not
for
any
considerable
period
oppose
a
successful
resistance
to
tyranny
and
oppression
from
the
educated
few
but
will
inevitably
sink
into
acquiescence
to
the
will
of
intelligence
whether
directed
by
the
demagogue
or
by
priestcraft
hence
the
education
of
the
masses
becomes
of
the
first
necessity
for
the
preservation
of
our
institutions
they
are
worth
preserving
because
they
have
secured
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
proportion
of
the
population
of
any
form
of
government
yet
devised
all
other
forms
of
government
approach
it
just
in
proportion
to
the
general
diffusion
of
education
and
independence
of
thought
and
action
as
the
primary
step
therefore
to
our
advancement
in
all
that
has
marked
our
progress
in
the
past
century
i
suggest
for
your
earnest
consideration
and
most
earnestly
recommend
it
that
a
constitutional
amendment
be
submitted
to
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
for
ratification
making
it
the
duty
of
each
of
the
several
states
to
establish
and
forever
maintain
free
public
schools
adequate
to
the
education
of
all
the
children
in
the
rudimentary
branches
within
their
respective
limits
irrespective
of
sex
color
birthplace
or
religions
forbidding
the
teaching
in
said
schools
of
religious
atheistic
or
pagan
tenets
and
prohibiting
the
granting
of
any
school
funds
or
school
taxes
or
any
part
thereof
either
by
legislative
municipal
or
other
authority
for
the
benefit
or
in
aid
directly
or
indirectly
of
any
religious
sect
or
denomination
or
in
aid
or
for
the
benefit
of
any
other
object
of
any
nature
or
kind
whatever
in
connection
with
this
important
question
i
would
also
call
your
attention
to
the
importance
of
correcting
an
evil
that
if
permitted
to
continue
will
probably
lead
to
great
trouble
in
our
land
before
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
is
the
accumulation
of
vast
amounts
of
untaxed
church
property
in
i
believe
the
church
property
of
the
united
states
which
paid
no
tax
municipal
or
state
amounted
to
about
in
the
amount
had
doubled
in
it
is
about
by
without
check
it
is
safe
to
say
this
property
will
reach
a
sum
exceeding
so
vast
a
sum
receiving
all
the
protection
and
benefits
of
government
without
bearing
its
proportion
of
the
burdens
and
expenses
of
the
same
will
not
be
looked
upon
acquiescently
by
those
who
have
to
pay
the
taxes
in
a
growing
country
where
real
estate
enhances
so
rapidly
with
time
as
in
the
united
states
there
is
scarcely
a
limit
to
the
wealth
that
may
be
acquired
by
corporations
religious
or
otherwise
if
allowed
to
retain
real
estate
without
taxation
the
contemplation
of
so
vast
a
property
as
here
alluded
to
without
taxation
may
lead
to
sequestration
without
constitutional
authority
and
through
blood
i
would
suggest
the
taxation
of
all
property
equally
whether
church
or
corporation
exempting
only
the
last
resting
place
of
the
dead
and
possibly
with
proper
restrictions
church
edifices
our
relations
with
most
of
the
foreign
powers
continue
on
a
satisfactory
and
friendly
footing
increased
intercourse
the
extension
of
commerce
and
the
cultivation
of
mutual
interests
have
steadily
improved
our
relations
with
the
large
majority
of
the
powers
of
the
world
rendering
practicable
the
peaceful
solution
of
questions
which
from
time
to
time
necessarily
arise
leaving
few
which
demand
extended
or
particular
notice
the
correspondence
of
the
department
of
state
with
our
diplomatic
representatives
abroad
is
transmitted
herewith
i
am
happy
to
announce
the
passage
of
an
act
by
the
general
cortes
of
portugal
proclaimed
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
for
the
abolition
of
servitude
in
the
portuguese
colonies
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
such
legislation
may
be
another
step
toward
the
great
consummation
to
be
reached
when
no
man
shall
be
permitted
directly
or
indirectly
under
any
guise
excuse
or
form
of
law
to
hold
his
fellowman
in
bondage
i
am
of
opinion
also
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
united
states
as
contributing
toward
that
end
and
required
by
the
spirit
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
to
provide
by
suitable
legislation
that
no
citizen
of
the
united
states
shall
hold
slaves
as
property
in
any
other
country
or
be
interested
therein
chile
has
made
reparation
in
the
case
of
the
whale
ship
good
return
seized
without
sufficient
cause
upward
of
forty
years
ago
though
she
had
hitherto
denied
her
accountability
the
denial
was
never
acquiesced
in
by
this
government
and
the
justice
of
the
claim
has
been
so
earnestly
contended
for
that
it
has
been
gratifying
that
she
should
have
at
last
acknowledged
it
the
arbitrator
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
steamer
montijo
for
the
seizure
and
detention
of
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
colombia
was
held
accountable
has
decided
in
favor
of
the
claim
this
decision
has
settled
a
question
which
had
been
pending
for
several
years
and
which
while
it
continued
open
might
more
or
less
disturb
the
good
understanding
which
it
is
desirable
should
be
maintained
between
the
two
republics
a
reciprocity
treaty
with
the
king
of
the
hawaiian
islands
was
concluded
some
months
since
as
it
contains
a
stipulation
that
it
shall
not
take
effect
until
congress
shall
enact
the
proper
legislation
for
that
purpose
copies
of
the
instrument
are
herewith
submitted
in
order
that
if
such
should
be
the
pleasure
of
congress
the
necessary
legislation
upon
the
subject
may
be
adopted
in
march
last
an
arrangement
was
made
through
mr
cushing
our
minister
in
madrid
with
the
spanish
government
for
the
payment
by
the
latter
to
the
united
states
of
the
sum
of
in
coin
for
the
purpose
of
the
relief
of
the
families
or
persons
of
the
ships
company
and
certain
passengers
of
the
virginius
this
sum
was
to
have
bee
n
paid
in
three
installments
at
two
months
each
it
is
due
to
the
spanish
government
that
i
should
state
that
the
payments
were
fully
and
spontaneously
anticipated
by
that
government
and
that
the
whole
amount
was
paid
within
but
a
few
days
more
than
two
months
from
the
date
of
the
agreement
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
transmitted
in
pursuance
of
the
terms
of
the
adjustment
i
have
directed
the
distribution
of
the
amount
among
the
parties
entitled
thereto
including
the
ships
company
and
such
of
the
passengers
as
were
american
citizens
payments
are
made
accordingly
on
the
application
by
the
parties
entitled
thereto
the
past
year
has
furnished
no
evidence
of
an
approaching
termination
of
the
ruinous
conflict
which
has
been
raging
for
seven
years
in
the
neighboring
island
of
cuba
the
same
disregard
of
the
laws
of
civilized
warfare
and
of
the
just
demands
of
humanity
which
has
heretofore
called
forth
expressions
of
condemnation
from
the
nations
of
christendom
has
continued
to
blacken
the
sad
scene
desolation
ruin
and
pillage
are
pervading
the
rich
fields
of
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
productive
regions
of
the
earth
and
the
incendiarys
torch
firing
plantations
and
valuable
factories
and
buildings
is
the
agent
marking
the
alternate
advance
or
retreat
of
contending
parties
the
protracted
continuance
of
this
strife
seriously
affects
the
interests
of
all
commercial
nations
but
those
of
the
united
states
more
than
others
by
reason
of
close
proximity
its
larger
trade
and
intercourse
with
cuba
and
the
frequent
and
intimate
personal
and
social
relations
which
have
grown
up
between
its
citizens
and
those
of
the
island
moreover
the
property
of
our
citizens
in
cuba
is
large
and
is
rendered
insecure
and
depreciated
in
value
and
in
capacity
of
production
by
the
continuance
of
the
strife
and
the
unnatural
mode
of
its
conduct
the
same
is
true
differing
only
in
degree
with
respect
to
the
interests
and
people
of
other
nations
and
the
absence
of
any
reasonable
assurance
of
a
near
termination
of
the
conflict
must
of
necessity
soon
compel
the
states
thus
suffering
to
consider
what
the
interests
of
their
own
people
and
their
duty
toward
themselves
may
demand
i
have
hoped
that
spain
would
be
enabled
to
establish
peace
in
her
colony
to
afford
security
to
the
property
and
the
interests
of
our
citizens
and
allow
legitimate
scope
to
trade
and
commerce
and
the
natural
productions
of
the
island
because
of
this
hope
and
from
an
extreme
reluctance
to
interfere
in
the
most
remote
manner
in
the
affairs
of
another
and
a
friendly
nation
especially
of
one
whose
sympathy
and
friendship
in
the
struggling
infancy
of
our
own
existence
must
ever
be
remembered
with
gratitude
i
have
patiently
and
anxiously
waited
the
progress
of
events
our
own
civil
conflict
is
too
recent
for
us
not
to
consider
the
difficulties
which
surround
a
government
distracted
by
a
dynastic
rebellion
at
home
at
the
same
time
that
it
has
to
cope
with
a
separate
insurrection
in
a
distant
colony
but
whatever
causes
may
have
produced
the
situation
which
so
grievously
affects
our
interests
it
exists
with
all
its
attendant
evils
operating
directly
upon
this
country
and
its
people
thus
far
all
the
efforts
of
spain
have
proved
abortive
and
time
has
marked
no
improvement
in
the
situation
the
armed
bands
of
either
side
now
occupy
nearly
the
same
ground
as
in
the
past
with
the
difference
from
time
to
time
of
more
lives
sacrificed
more
property
destroyed
and
wider
extents
of
fertile
and
productive
fields
and
more
and
more
of
valuable
property
constantly
wantonly
sacrificed
to
the
incendiarys
torch
in
contests
of
this
nature
where
a
considerable
body
of
people
who
have
attempted
to
free
themselves
of
the
control
of
the
superior
government
have
reached
such
point
in
occupation
of
territory
in
power
and
in
general
organization
as
to
constitute
in
fact
a
body
politic
having
a
government
in
substance
as
well
as
in
name
possessed
of
the
elements
of
stability
and
equipped
with
the
machinery
for
the
administration
of
internal
policy
and
the
execution
of
its
laws
prepared
and
able
to
administer
justice
at
home
as
well
as
in
its
dealings
with
other
powers
it
is
within
the
province
of
those
other
powers
to
recognize
its
existence
as
a
new
and
independent
nation
in
such
cases
other
nations
simply
deal
with
an
actually
existing
condition
of
things
and
recognize
as
one
of
the
powers
of
the
earth
that
body
politic
which
possessing
the
necessary
elements
has
in
fact
become
a
new
power
in
a
word
the
creation
of
a
new
state
is
a
fact
to
establish
the
condition
of
things
essential
to
the
recognition
of
this
fact
there
must
be
a
people
occupying
a
known
territory
united
under
some
known
and
defined
form
of
government
acknowledged
by
those
subject
thereto
in
which
the
functions
of
government
are
administered
by
usual
methods
competent
to
mete
out
justice
to
citizens
and
strangers
to
afford
remedies
for
public
and
for
private
wrongs
and
able
to
assume
the
correlative
international
obligations
and
capable
of
performing
the
corresponding
international
duties
resulting
from
its
acquisition
of
the
rights
of
sovereignty
a
power
should
exist
complete
in
its
organization
ready
to
take
and
able
to
maintain
its
place
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
while
conscious
that
the
insurrection
in
cuba
has
shown
a
strength
and
endurance
which
make
it
at
least
doubtful
whether
it
be
in
the
power
of
spain
to
subdue
it
it
seems
unquestionable
that
no
such
civil
organization
exists
which
may
be
recognized
as
an
independent
government
capable
of
performing
its
international
obligations
and
entitled
to
be
treated
as
one
of
the
powers
of
the
earth
a
recognition
under
such
circumstances
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
facts
and
would
compel
the
power
granting
it
soon
to
support
by
force
the
government
to
which
it
had
really
given
its
only
claim
of
existence
in
my
judgment
the
united
states
should
adhere
to
the
policy
and
the
principles
which
have
heretofore
been
its
sure
and
safe
guides
in
like
contests
between
revolted
colonies
and
their
mother
country
and
acting
only
upon
the
clearest
evidence
should
avoid
any
possibility
of
suspicion
or
of
imputation
a
recognition
of
the
independence
of
cuba
being
in
my
opinion
impracticable
and
indefensible
the
question
which
next
presents
itself
is
that
of
the
recognition
of
belligerent
rights
in
the
parties
to
the
contest
in
a
former
message
to
congress
i
had
occasion
to
consider
this
question
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
conflict
in
cuba
dreadful
and
devastating
as
were
its
incidents
did
not
rise
to
the
fearful
dignity
of
war
regarding
it
now
after
this
lapse
of
time
i
am
unable
to
see
that
any
notable
success
or
any
marked
or
real
advance
on
the
part
of
the
insurgents
has
essentially
changed
the
character
of
the
contest
it
has
acquired
greater
age
but
not
greater
or
more
formidable
proportions
it
is
possible
that
the
acts
of
foreign
powers
and
even
acts
of
spain
herself
of
this
very
nature
might
be
pointed
to
in
defense
of
such
recognition
but
now
as
in
its
past
history
the
united
states
should
carefully
avoid
the
false
lights
which
might
lead
it
into
the
mazes
of
doubtful
law
and
of
questionable
propriety
and
adhere
rigidly
and
sternly
to
the
rule
which
has
been
its
guide
of
doing
only
that
which
is
right
and
honest
and
of
good
report
the
question
of
according
or
of
withholding
rights
of
belligerency
must
be
judged
in
every
case
in
view
of
the
particular
attending
facts
unless
justified
by
necessity
it
is
always
and
justly
regarded
as
an
unfriendly
act
and
a
gratuitous
demonstration
of
moral
support
to
the
rebellion
it
is
necessary
and
it
is
required
when
the
interests
and
rights
of
another
government
or
of
its
people
are
so
far
affected
by
a
pending
civil
conflict
as
to
require
a
definition
of
its
relations
to
the
parties
thereto
but
this
conflict
must
be
one
which
will
be
recognized
in
the
sense
of
international
law
as
war
belligerence
too
is
a
fact
the
mere
existence
of
contending
armed
bodies
and
their
occasional
conflicts
do
not
constitute
war
in
the
sense
referred
to
applying
to
the
existing
condition
of
affairs
in
cuba
the
tests
recognized
by
publicists
and
writers
on
international
law
and
which
have
been
observed
by
nations
of
dignity
honesty
and
power
when
free
from
sensitive
or
selfish
and
unworthy
motives
i
fail
to
find
in
the
insurrection
the
existence
of
such
a
substantial
political
organization
real
palpable
and
manifest
to
the
world
having
the
forms
and
capable
of
the
ordinary
functions
of
government
toward
its
own
people
and
to
other
states
with
courts
for
the
administration
of
justice
with
a
local
habitation
possessing
such
organization
of
force
such
material
such
occupation
of
territory
as
to
take
the
contest
out
of
the
category
of
a
mere
rebellious
insurrection
or
occasional
skirmishes
and
place
it
on
the
terrible
footing
of
war
to
which
a
recognition
of
belligerency
would
aim
to
elevate
it
the
contest
moreover
is
solely
on
land
the
insurrection
has
not
possessed
itself
of
a
single
seaport
whence
it
may
send
forth
its
flag
nor
has
it
any
means
of
communication
with
foreign
powers
except
through
the
military
lines
of
its
adversaries
no
apprehension
of
any
of
those
sudden
and
difficult
complications
which
a
war
upon
the
ocean
is
apt
to
precipitate
upon
the
vessels
both
commercial
and
national
and
upon
the
consular
officers
of
other
powers
calls
for
the
definition
of
their
relations
to
the
parties
to
the
contest
considered
as
a
question
of
expediency
i
regard
the
accordance
of
belligerent
rights
still
to
be
as
unwise
and
premature
as
i
regard
it
to
be
at
present
indefensible
as
a
measure
of
right
such
recognition
entails
upon
the
country
according
the
rights
which
flow
from
it
difficult
and
complicated
duties
and
requires
the
exaction
from
the
contending
parties
of
the
strict
observance
of
their
rights
and
obligations
it
confers
the
right
of
search
upon
the
high
seas
by
vessels
of
both
parties
it
would
subject
the
carrying
of
arms
and
munitions
of
war
which
now
may
be
transported

freely
and
without
interruption
in
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
to
detention
and
to
possible
seizure
it
would
give
rise
to
countless
vexatious
questions
would
release
the
parent
government
from
responsibility
for
acts
done
by
the
insurgents
and
would
invest
spain
with
the
right
to
exercise
the
supervision
recognized
by
our
treaty
of
over
our
commerce
on
the
high
seas
a
very
large
part
of
which
in
its
traffic
between
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
states
and
between
all
of
them
and
the
states
on
the
pacific
passes
through
the
waters
which
wash
the
shores
of
cuba
the
exercise
of
this
supervision
could
scarce
fail
to
lead
if
not
to
abuses
certainly
to
collisions
perilous
to
the
peaceful
relations
of
the
two
states
there
can
be
little
doubt
to
what
result
such
supervision
would
before
long
draw
this
nation
it
would
be
unworthy
of
the
united
states
to
inaugurate
the
possibilities
of
such
result
by
measures
of
questionable
right
or
expediency
or
by
any
indirection
apart
from
any
question
of
theoretical
right
i
am
satisfied
that
while
the
accordance
of
belligerent
rights
to
the
insurgents
in
cuba
might
give
them
a
hope
and
an
inducement
to
protract
the
struggle
it
would
be
but
a
delusive
hope
and
would
not
remove
the
evils
which
this
government
and
its
people
are
experiencing
but
would
draw
the
united
states
into
complications
which
it
has
waited
long
and
already
suffered
much
to
avoid
the
recognition
of
independence
or
of
belligerency
being
thus
in
my
judgment
equally
inadmissible
it
remains
to
consider
what
course
shall
be
adopted
should
the
conflict
not
soon
be
brought
to
an
end
by
acts
of
the
parties
themselves
and
should
the
evils
which
result
therefrom
affecting
all
nations
and
particularly
the
united
states
continue
in
such
event
i
am
of
opinion
that
other
nations
will
be
compelled
to
assume
the
responsibility
which
devolves
upon
them
and
to
seriously
consider
the
only
remaining
measures
possiblemediation
and
intervention
owing
perhaps
to
the
large
expanse
of
water
separating
the
island
from
the
peninsula
the
want
of
harmony
and
of
personal
sympathy
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
colony
and
those
sent
thither
to
rule
them
and
want
of
adaptation
of
the
ancient
colonial
system
of
europe
to
the
present
times
and
to
the
ideas
which
the
events
of
the
past
century
have
developed
the
contending
parties
appear
to
have
within
themselves
no
depository
of
common
confidence
to
suggest
wisdom
when
passion
and
excitement
have
their
sway
and
to
assume
the
part
of
peacemaker
in
this
view
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
contest
the
good
offices
of
the
united
states
as
a
mediator
were
tendered
in
good
faith
without
any
selfish
purpose
in
the
interest
of
humanity
and
in
sincere
friendship
for
both
parties
but
were
at
the
time
declined
by
spain
with
the
declaration
nevertheless
that
at
a
future
time
they
would
be
indispensable
no
intimation
has
been
received
that
in
the
opinion
of
spain
that
time
has
been
reached
and
yet
the
strife
continues
with
all
its
dread
horrors
and
all
its
injuries
to
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
of
other
nations
each
party
seems
quite
capable
of
working
great
injury
and
damage
to
the
other
as
well
as
to
all
the
relations
and
interests
dependent
on
the
existence
of
peace
in
the
island
but
they
seem
incapable
of
reaching
any
adjustment
and
both
have
thus
far
failed
of
achieving
any
success
whereby
one
party
shall
possess
and
control
the
island
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
under
these
circumstances
the
agency
of
others
either
by
mediation
or
by
intervention
seems
to
be
the
only
alternative
which
must
sooner
or
later
be
invoked
for
the
termination
of
the
strife
at
the
same
time
while
thus
impressed
i
do
not
at
this
time
recommend
the
adoption
of
any
measure
of
intervention
i
shall
be
ready
at
all
times
and
as
the
equal
friend
of
both
parties
to
respond
to
a
suggestion
that
the
good
offices
of
the
united
states
will
be
acceptable
to
aid
in
bringing
about
a
peace
honorable
to
both
it
is
due
to
spain
so
far
as
this
government
is
concerned
that
the
agency
of
a
third
power
to
which
i
have
adverted
shall
be
adopted
only
as
a
last
expedient
had
it
been
the
desire
of
the
united
states
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
cuba
repeated
opportunities
for
so
doing
have
been
presented
within
the
last
few
years
but
we
have
remained
passive
and
have
performed
our
whole
duty
and
all
international
obligations
to
spain
with
friendship
fairness
and
fidelity
and
with
a
spirit
of
patience
and
forbearance
which
negatives
every
possible
suggestion
of
desire
to
interfere
or
to
add
to
the
difficulties
with
which
she
has
been
surrounded
the
government
of
spain
has
recently
submitted
to
our
minister
at
madrid
certain
proposals
which
it
is
hoped
may
be
found
to
be
the
basis
if
not
the
actual
submission
of
terms
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
particular
griefs
of
which
this
government
has
felt
itself
entitled
to
complain
these
proposals
have
not
yet
reached
me
in
their
full
text
on
their
arrival
they
will
be
taken
into
careful
examination
and
may
i
hope
lead
to
a
satisfactory
adjustment
of
the
questions
to
which
they
refer
and
remove
the
possibility
of
future
occurrences
such
as
have
given
rise
to
our
just
complaints
it
is
understood
also
that
renewed
efforts
are
being
made
to
introduce
reforms
in
the
internal
administration
of
the
island
persuaded
however
that
a
proper
regard
for
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
of
its
citizens
entitles
it
to
relief
from
the
strain
to
which
it
has
been
subjected
by
the
difficulties
of
the
questions
and
the
wrongs
and
losses
which
arise
from
the
contest
in
cuba
and
that
the
interests
of
humanity
itself
demand
the
cessation
of
the
strife
before
the
whole
island
shall
be
laid
waste
and
larger
sacrifices
of
life
be
made
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
should
my
hopes
of
a
satisfactory
adjustment
and
of
the
early
restoration
of
peace
and
the
removal
of
future
causes
of
complaint
be
unhappily
disappointed
to
make
a
further
communication
to
congress
at
some
period
not
far
remote
and
during
the
present
session
recommending
what
may
then
seem
to
me
to
be
necessary
the
free
zone
so
called
several
years
since
established
by
the
mexican
government
in
certain
of
the
states
of
that
republic
adjacent
to
our
frontier
remains
in
full
operation
it
has
always
been
materially
injurious
to
honest
traffic
for
it
operates
as
an
incentive
to
traders
in
mexico
to
supply
without
customs
charges
the
wants
of
inhabitants
on
this
side
of
the
line
and
prevents
the
same
wants
from
being
supplied
by
merchants
of
the
united
states
thereby
to
a
considerable
extent
defrauding
our
revenue
and
checking
honest
commercial
enterprise
depredations
by
armed
bands
from
mexico
on
the
people
of
texas
near
the
frontier
continue
though
the
main
object
of
these
incursions
is
robbery
they
frequently
result
in
the
murder
of
unarmed
and
peaceably
disposed
persons
and
in
some
instances
even
the
united
states
postoffices
and
mail
communications
have
been
attacked
renewed
remonstrances
upon
this
subject
have
been
addressed
to
the
mexican
government
but
without
much
apparent
effect
the
military
force
of
this
government
disposable
for
service
in
that
quarter
is
quite
inadequate
to
effectually
guard
the
line
even
at
those
points
where
the
incursions
are
usually
made
an
experiment
of
an
armed
vessel
on
the
rio
grande
for
that
purpose
is
on
trial
and
it
is
hoped
that
if
not
thwarted
by
the
shallowness
of
the
river
and
other
natural
obstacles
it
may
materially
contribute
to
the
protection
of
the
herdsmen
of
texas
the
proceedings
of
the
joint
commission
under
the
convention
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
of
the
th
of
july
on
the
subject
of
claims
will
soon
be
brought
to
a
close
the
result
of
those
proceedings
will
then
be
communicated
to
congress
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
the
government
of
venezuela
has
upon
further
consideration
practically
abandoned
its
objection
to
pay
to
the
united
states
that
share
of
its
revenue
which
some
years
since
it
allotted
toward
the
extinguishment
of
the
claims
of
foreigners
generally
in
thus
reconsidering
its
determination
that
government
has
shown
a
just
sense
of
selfrespect
which
can
not
fail
to
reflect
credit
upon
it
in
the
eyes
of
all
disinterested
persons
elsewhere
it
is
to
be
regretted
however
that
its
payments
on
account
of
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
are
still
so
meager
in
amount
and
that
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
in
regard
to
the
sums
to
be
paid
and
the
periods
when
those
payments
were
to
take
place
should
have
been
so
signally
disregarded
since
my
last
annual
message
the
exchange
has
been
made
of
the
ratification
of
a
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
with
belgium
and
of
conventions
with
the
mexican
republic
for
the
further
extension
of
the
joint
commission
respecting
claims
with
the
hawaiian
islands
for
commercial
reciprocity
and
with
the
ottoman
empire
for
extradition
all
of
which
have
been
duly
proclaimed
the
court
of
commissioners
of
alabama
claims
has
prosecuted
its
important
duties
very
assiduously
and
very
satisfactorily
it
convened
and
was
organized
on
the
d
day
of
july
and
by
the
terms
of
the
act
under
which
it
was
created
was
to
exist
for
one
year
from
that
date
the
act
provided
however
that
should
it
be
found
impracticable
to
complete
the
work
of
the
court
before
the
expiration
of
the
year
the
president
might
by
proclamation
extend
the
time
of
its
duration
to
a
period
not
more
than
six
months
beyond
the
expiration
of
the
one
year
having
received
satisfactory
evidence
that
it
would
be
impracticable
to
complete
the
work
within
the
time
originally
fixed
i
issued
a
proclamation
a
copy
of
which
is
presented
herewith
extending
the
time
of
duration
of
the
court
for
a
period
of
six
months
from
and
after
the
d
day
of
july
last
a
report
made
through
the
clerk
of
the
court
communicated
herewith
shows
the
condition
of
the
calendar
on
the
st
of
november
last
and
the
large
amount
of
work
which
has
been
accomplished
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
eightytwo
claims
have
been
presented
of
which
had
bee
n
disposed
of
at
the
date
of
the
report
i
am
informed
that
cases
were
decided
during
the
month
of
november
arguments
are
being
made
and
decisions
given
in
the
remaining
cases
with
all
the
dispatch
consistent
with
the
proper
consideration
of
the
questions
submitted
many
of
these
claims
are
in
behalf
of
mariners
or
depend
on
the
evidence
of
mariners
whose
absence
has
delayed
the
taking
or
the
return
of
the
necessary
evidence
it
is
represented
to
me
that
it
will
be
impracticable
for
the
court
to
finally
dispose
of
all
the
cases
before
it
within
the
present
limit
of
its
duration
justice
to
the
parties
claimant
who
have
been
at
large
expense
in
preparing
their
claims
and
obtaining
the
evidence
in
their
support
suggests
a
short
extension
to
enable
the
court
to
dispose
of
all
of
the
claims
which
have
been
presented
i
recommend
the
legislation
which
may
be
deemed
proper
to
enable
the
court
to
complete
the
work
before
it
i
recommend
that
some
suitable
provision
be
made
by
the
creation
of
a
special
court
or
by
conferring
the
necessary
jurisdiction
upon
some
appropriate
tribunal
for
the
consideration
and
determination
of
the
claims
of
aliens
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
which
have
arisen
within
some
reasonable
limitation
of
time
or
which
may
hereafter
arise
excluding
all
claims
barred
by
treaty
provisions
or
otherwise
it
has
been
found
impossible
to
give
proper
consideration
to
these
claims
by
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
such
a
tribunal
would
afford
an
opportunity
to
aliens
other
than
british
subjects
to
present
their
claims
on
account
of
acts
committed
against
their
persons
or
property
during
the
rebellion
as
also
to
those
subjects
of
great
britain
whose
claims
having
arisen
subsequent
to
the
th
day
of
april
could
not
be
presented
to
the
late
commission
organized
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
washington
the
electric
telegraph
has
become
an
essential
and
indispensable
agent
in
the
transmission
of
business
and
social
messages
its
operation
on
land
and
within
the
limit
of
particular
states
is
necessarily
under
the
control
of
the
jurisdiction
within
which
it
operates
the
lines
on
the
high
seas
however
are
not
subject
to
the
particular
control
of
any
one
government
in
a
concession
was
granted
by
the
french
government
to
a
company
which
proposed
to
lay
a
cable
from
the
shores
of
france
to
the
united
states
at
that
time
there
was
a
telegraphic
connection
between
the
united
states
and
the
continent
of
europe
through
the
possessions
of
great
britain
at
either
end
of
the
line
under
the
control
of
an
association
which
had
at
large
outlay
of
capital
and
at
great
risk
demonstrated
the
practicability
of
maintaining
such
means
of
communication
the
cost
of
correspondence
by
this
agency
was
great
possibly
not
too
large
at
the
time
for
a
proper
remuneration
for
so
hazardous
and
so
costly
an
enterprise
it
was
however
a
heavy
charge
upon
a
means
of
communication
which
the
progress
in
the
social
and
commercial
intercourse
of
the
world
found
to
be
a
necessity
and
the
obtaining
of
this
french
concession
showed
that
other
capital
than
that
already
invested
was
ready
to
enter
into
competition
with
assurance
of
adequate
return
for
their
outlay
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
the
interests
not
only
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
but
of
the
world
at
large
demanded
or
would
demand
the
multiplication
of
such
means
of
communication
between
separated
continents
i
was
desirous
that
the
proposed
connection
should
be
made
but
certain
provisions
of
this
concession
were
deemed
by
me
to
be
objectionable
particularly
one
which
gave
for
a
long
term
of
years
the
exclusive
right
of
telegraphic
communication
by
submarine
cable
between
the
shores
of
france
and
the
united
states
i
could
not
concede
that
any
power
should
claim
the
right
to
land
a
cable
on
the
shores
of
the
united
states
and
at
the
same
time
deny
to
the
united
states
or
to
its
citizens
or
grantees
an
equal
fight
to
land
a
cable
on
its
shores
the
right
to
control
the
conditions
for
the
laying
of
a
cable
within
the
jurisdictional
waters
of
the
united
states
to
connect
our
shores
with
those
of
any
foreign
state
pertains
exclusively
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
under
such
limitations
and
conditions
as
congress
may
impose
in
the
absence
of
legislation
by
congress
i
was
unwilling
on
the
one
hand
to
yield
to
a
foreign
state
the
right
to
say
that
its
grantees
might
land
on
our
shores
while
it
denied
a
similar
right
to
our
people
to
land
on
its
shores
and
on
the
other
hand
i
was
reluctant
to
deny
to
the
great
interests
of
the
world
and
of
civilization
the
facilities
of
such
communication
as
were
proposed
i
therefore
withheld
any
resistance
to
the
landing
of
the
cable
on
condition
that
the
offensive
monopoly
feature
of
the
concession
be
abandoned
and
that
the
right
of
any
cable
which
may
be
established
by
authority
of
this
government
to
land
upon
french
territory
and
to
connect
with
french
land
lines
and
enjoy
all
the
necessary
facilities
or
privileges
incident
to
the
use
thereof
upon
as
favorable
terms
as
any
other
company
be
conceded
as
the
result
thereof
the
company
in
question
renounced
the
exclusive
privilege
and
the
representative
of
france
was
informed
that
understanding
this
relinquishment
to
be
construed
as
granting
the
entire
reciprocity
and
equal
facilities
which
had
been
demanded
the
opposition
to
the
landing
of
the
cable
was
withdrawn
the
cable
under
this
french
concession
was
landed
in
the
month
of
july
and
has
been
an
efficient
and
valuable
agent
of
communication
between
this
country
and
the
other
continent
it
soon
passed
under
the
control
however
of
those
who
had
the
management
of
the
cable
connecting
great
britain
with
this
continent
and
thus
whatever
benefit
to
the
public
might
have
ensued
from
competition
between
the
two
lines
was
lost
leaving
only
the
greater
facilities
of
an
additional
line
and
the
additional
security
in
case
of
accident
to
one
of
them
but
these
increased
facilities
and
this
additional
security
together
with
the
control
of
the
combined
capital
of
the
two
companies
gave
also
greater
power
to
prevent
the
future
construction
of
other
lines
and
to
limit
the
control
of
telegraphic
communication
between
the
two
continents
to
those
possessing
the
lines
already
laid
within
a
few
months
past
a
cable
has
been
laid
known
as
the
united
states
direct
cable
company
connecting
the
united
states
directly
with
great
britain
as
soon
as
this
cable
was
reported
to
be
laid
and
in
working
order
the
rates
of
the
then
existing
consolidated
companies
were
greatly
reduced
soon
however
a
break
was
announced
in
this
new
cable
and
immediately
the
rates
of
the
other
line
which
had
been
reduced
were
again
raised
this
cable
being
now
repaired
the
rates
appear
not
to
be
reduced
by
either
line
from
those
formerly
charged
by
the
consolidated
companies
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
large
amounts
of
capital
both
at
home
and
abroad
are
ready
to
seek
profitable
investment
in
the
advancement
of
this
useful
and
most
civilizing
means
of
intercourse
and
correspondence
they
await
however
the
assurance
of
the
means
and
conditions
on
which
they
may
safely
be
made
tributary
to
the
general
good
as
these
cable
telegraph
lines
connect
separate
states
there
are
questions
as
to
their
organization
and
control
which
probably
can
be
best
if
not
solely
settled
by
conventions
between
the
respective
states
in
the
absence
however
of
international
conventions
on
the
subject
municipal
legislation
may
secure
many
points
which
appear
to
me
important
if
not
indispensable
for
the
protection
of
the
public
against
the
extortions
which
may
result
from
a
monopoly
of
the
right
of
operating
cable
telegrams
or
from
a
combination
between
several
lines
i
no
line
should
be
allowed
to
land
on
the
shores
of
the
united
states
under
the
concession
from
another
power
which
does
not
admit
the
right
of
any
other
line
or
lines
formed
in
the
united
states
to
land
and
freely
connect
with
and
operate
through
its
land
lines
ii
no
line
should
be
allowed
to
land
on
the
shores
of
the
united
states
which
is
not
by
treaty
stipulation
with
the
government
from
whose
shores
it
proceeds
or
by
prohibition
in
its
charter
or
otherwise
to
the
satisfaction
of
this
government
prohibited
from
consolidating
or
amalgamating
with
any
other
cable
telegraph
line
or
combining
therewith
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
and
maintaining
the
cost
of
telegraphing
iii
all
lines
should
be
bound
to
give
precedence
in
the
transmission
of
the
official
messages
of
the
governments
of
the
two
countries
between
which
it
may
be
laid
iv
a
power
should
be
reserved
to
the
two
governments
either
conjointly
or
to
each
as
regards
the
messages
dispatched
from
its
shores
to
fix
a
limit
to
the
charges
to
be
demanded
for
the
transmission
of
messages
i
present
this
subject
to
the
earnest
consideration
of
congress
in
the
meantime
and
unless
congress
otherwise
direct
i
shall
not
oppose
the
landing
of
any
telegraphic
cable
which
complies
with
and
assents
to
the
points
above
enumerated
but
will
feel
it
my
duty
to
prevent
the
landing
of
any
which
does
not
conform
to
the
first
and
second
points
as
stated
and
which
will
not
stipulate
to
concede
to
this
government
the
precedence
in
the
transmission
of
its
official
messages
and
will
not
enter
into
a
satisfactory
arrangement
with
regard
to
its
charges
among
the
pressing
and
important
subjects
to
which
in
my
opinion
the
attention
of
congress
should
be
directed
are
those
relating
to
fraudulent
naturalization
and
expatriation
the
united
states
with
great
liberality
offers
its
citizenship
to
all
who
in
good
faith
comply
with
the
requirements
of
law
these
requirements
are
as
simple
and
upon
as
favorable
terms
to
the
emigrant
as
the
high
privilege
to
which
he
is
admitted
can
or
should
permit
i
do
not
propose
any
additional
requirements
to
those
which
the
law
now
demands
but
the
very
simplicity
and
the
want
of
unnecessary
formality
in
our
law
have
made
fraudulent
naturalization
not
infrequent
to
the
discredit

and
injury
of
all
honest
citizens
whether
native
or
naturalized
cases
of
this
character
are
continually
being
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
government
by
our
representatives
abroad
and
also
those
of
persons
resident
in
other
countries
most
frequently
those
who
if
they
have
remained
in
this
country
long
enough
to
entitle
them
to
become
naturalized
have
generally
not
much
overpassed
that
period
and
have
returned
to
the
country
of
their
origin
where
they
reside
avoiding
all
duties
to
the
united
states
by
their
absence
and
claiming
to
be
exempt
from
all
duties
to
the
country
of
their
nativity
and
of
their
residence
by
reason
of
their
alleged
naturalization
it
is
due
to
this
government
itself
and
to
the
great
mass
of
the
naturalized
citizens
who
entirely
both
in
name
and
in
fact
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
that
the
high
privilege
of
citizenship
of
the
united
states
should
not
be
held
by
fraud
or
in
derogation
of
the
laws
and
of
the
good
name
of
every
honest
citizen
on
many
occasions
it
has
been
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
government
that
certificates
of
naturalization
are
held
and
protection
or
interference
claimed
by
parties
who
admit
that
not
only
they
were
not
within
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
the
pretended
naturalization
but
that
they
have
never
resided
in
the
united
states
in
others
the
certificate
and
record
of
the
court
show
on
their
face
that
the
person
claiming
to
be
naturalized
had
not
resided
the
required
time
in
the
united
states
in
others
it
is
admitted
upon
examination
that
the
requirements
of
law
have
not
been
complied
with
in
some
cases
even
such
certificates
have
been
matter
of
purchase
these
are
not
isolated
cases
arising
at
rare
intervals
but
of
common
occurrence
and
which
are
reported
from
all
quarters
of
the
globe
such
occurrences
can
not
and
do
not
fail
to
reflect
upon
the
government
and
injure
all
honest
citizens
such
a
fraud
being
discovered
however
there
is
no
practicable
means
within
the
control
of
the
government
by
which
the
record
of
naturalization
can
be
vacated
and
should
the
certificate
be
taken
up
as
it
usually
is
by
the
diplomatic
and
consular
representatives
of
the
government
to
whom
it
may
have
been
presented
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
person
claiming
to
have
been
naturalized
from
obtaining
a
new
certificate
from
the
court
in
place
of
that
which
has
been
taken
from
him
the
evil
has
become
so
great
and
of
such
frequent
occurrence
that
i
can
not
too
earnestly
recommend
that
some
effective
measures
be
adopted
to
provide
a
proper
remedy
and
means
for
the
vacating
of
any
record
thus
fraudulently
made
and
of
punishing
the
guilty
parties
to
the
transaction
in
this
connection
i
refer
also
to
the
question
of
expatriation
and
the
election
of
nationality
the
united
states
was
foremost
in
upholding
the
right
of
expatriation
and
was
principally
instrumental
in
overthrowing
the
doctrine
of
perpetual
allegiance
congress
has
declared
the
right
of
expatriation
to
be
a
natural
and
inherent
right
of
all
people
but
while
many
other
nations
have
enacted
laws
providing
what
formalities
shall
be
necessary
to
work
a
change
of
allegiance
the
united
states
has
enacted
no
provisions
of
law
and
has
in
no
respect
marked
out
how
and
when
expatriation
may
be
accomplished
by
its
citizens
instances
are
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
government
where
citizens
of
the
united
states
either
naturalized
or
native
born
have
formally
become
citizens
or
subjects
of
foreign
powers
but
who
nevertheless
in
the
absence
of
any
provisions
of
legislation
on
this
question
when
involved
in
difficulties
or
when
it
seems
to
be
their
interest
claim
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
demand
the
intervention
of
a
government
which
they
have
long
since
abandoned
and
to
which
for
years
they
have
rendered
no
service
nor
held
themselves
in
any
way
amenable
in
other
cases
naturalized
citizens
immediately
after
naturalization
have
returned
to
their
native
country
have
become
engaged
in
business
have
accepted
offices
or
pursuits
inconsistent
with
american
citizenship
and
evidence
no
intent
to
return
to
the
united
states
until
called
upon
to
discharge
some
duty
to
the
country
where
they
are
residing
when
at
once
they
assert
their
citizenship
and
call
upon
the
representatives
of
the
government
to
aid
them
in
their
unjust
pretensions
it
is
but
justice
to
all
bona
fide
citizens
that
no
doubt
should
exist
on
such
questions
and
that
congress
should
determine
by
enactment
of
law
how
expatriation
may
be
accomplished
and
change
of
citizenship
be
established
i
also
invite
your
attention
to
the
necessity
of
regulating
by
law
the
status
of
american
women
who
may
marry
foreigners
and
of
defining
more
fully
that
of
children
born
in
a
foreign
country
of
american
parents
who
may
reside
abroad
and
also
of
some
further
provision
regulating
or
giving
legal
effect
to
marriages
of
american
citizens
contracted
in
foreign
countries
the
correspondence
submitted
herewith
shows
a
few
of
the
constantly
occurring
questions
on
these
points
presented
to
the
consideration
of
the
government
there
are
few
subjects
to
engage
the
attention
of
congress
on
which
more
delicate
relations
or
more
important
interests
are
dependent
in
the
month
of
july
last
the
building
erected
for
the
department
of
state
was
taken
possession
of
and
occupied
by
that
department
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
the
archives
and
valuable
papers
of
the
government
in
the
custody
of
that
department
are
now
safely
deposited
and
properly
cared
for
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shows
the
receipts
from
customs
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
to
have
been
and
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
to
have
been
a
decrease
for
the
last
fiscal
year
of
receipts
from
internal
revenue
for
the
year
ending
the
th
of
june
were
and
for
the
year
ending
june
increase
the
report
also
shows
a
complete
history
of
the
workings
of
the
department
for
the
last
year
and
contains
recommendations
for
reforms
and
for
legislation
which
i
concur
in
but
can
not
comment
on
so
fully
as
i
should
like
to
do
if
space
would
permit
but
will
confine
myself
to
a
few
suggestions
which
i
look
upon
as
vital
to
the
best
interests
of
the
whole
peoplecoming
within
the
purview
of
treasury
i
mean
specie
resumption
too
much
stress
can
not
be
laid
upon
this
question
and
i
hope
congress
may
be
induced
at
the
earliest
day
practicable
to
insure
the
consummation
of
the
act
of
the
last
congress
at
its
last
session
to
bring
about
specie
resumption
on
and
after
the
st
of
january
at
furthest
it
would
be
a
great
blessing
if
this
could
be
consummated
even
at
an
earlier
day
nothing
seems
to
me
more
certain
than
that
a
full
healthy
and
permanent
reaction
can
not
take
place
in
favor
of
the
industries
and
financial
welfare
of
the
country
until
we
return
to
a
measure
of
values
recognized
throughout
the
civilized
world
while
we
use
a
currency
not
equivalent
to
this
standard
the
worlds
recognized
standard
specie
becomes
a
commodity
like
the
products
of
the
soil
the
surplus
seeking
a
market
wherever
there
is
a
demand
for
it
under
our
present
system
we
should
want
none
nor
would
we
have
any
were
it
not
that
customs
dues
must
be
paid
in
coin
and
because
of
the
pledge
to
pay
interest
on
the
public
debt
in
coin
the
yield
of
precious
metals
would
flow
out
for
the
purchase
of
foreign
productions
and
the
united
states
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
because
of
wiser
legislation
on
the
subject
of
finance
by
the
nations
with
whom
we
have
dealings
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
i
can
suggest
the
best
legislation
to
secure
the
end
most
heartily
recommended
it
will
be
a
source
of
great
gratification
to
me
to
be
able
to
approve
any
measure
of
congress
looking
effectively
toward
securing
resumption
unlimited
inflation
would
probably
bring
about
specie
payments
more
speedily
than
any
legislation
looking
to
redemption
of
the
legaltenders
in
coin
but
it
would
be
at
the
expense
of
honor
the
legaltenders
would
have
no
value
beyond
settling
present
liabilities
or
properly
speaking
repudiating
them
they
would
buy
nothing
after
debts
were
all
settled
there
are
a
few
measures
which
seem
to
me
important
in
this
connection
and
which
i
commend
to
your
earnest
consideration
a
repeal
of
so
much
of
the
legaltender
act
as
makes
these
notes
receivable
for
debts
contracted
after
a
date
to
be
fixed
in
the
act
itself
say
not
later
than
the
st
of
january
we
should
then
have
quotations
at
real
values
not
fictitious
ones
gold
would
no
longer
be
at
a
premium
but
currency
at
a
discount
a
healthy
reaction
would
set
in
at
once
and
with
it
a
desire
to
make
the
currency
equal
to
what
it
purports
to
be
the
merchants
manufacturers
and
tradesmen
of
every
calling
could
do
business
on
a
fair
margin
of
profit
the
money
to
be
received
having
an
unvarying
value
laborers
and
all
classes
who
work
for
stipulated
pay
or
salary
would
receive
more
for
their
income
because
extra
profits
would
no
longer
be
charged
by
the
capitalists
to
compensate
for
the
risk
of
a
downward
fluctuation
in
the
value
of
the
currency
second
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
be
authorized
to
redeem
say
not
to
exceed
monthly
of
legaltender
notes
by
issuing
in
their
stead
a
long
bond
bearing
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
per
annum
of
denominations
ranging
from
up
to
each
this
would
in
time
reduce
the
legaltender
notes
to
a
volume
that
could
be
kept
afloat
without
demanding
redemption
in
large
sums
suddenly
third
that
additional
power
be
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
accumulate
gold
for
final
redemption
either
by
increasing
revenue
curtailing
expenses
or
both
it
is
preferable
to
do
both
and
i
recommend
that
reduction
of
expenditures
be
made
wherever
it
can
be
done
without
impairing
government
obligations
or
crippling
the
due
execution
thereof
one
measure
for
increasing
the
revenueand
the
only
one
i
think
ofis
the
restoration
of
the
duty
on
tea
and
coffee
these
duties
would
add
probably
to
the
present
amount
received
from
imports
and
would
in
no
way
increase
the
prices
paid
for
those
articles
by
the
consu
mers
these
articles
are
the
products
of
countries
collecting
revenue
from
exports
and
as
we
the
largest
consumers
reduce
the
duties
they
proportionately
increase
them
with
this
addition
to
the
revenue
many
duties
now
collected
and
which
give
but
an
insignificant
return
for
the
cost
of
collection
might
be
remitted
and
to
the
direct
advantage
of
consumers
at
home
i
would
mention
those
articles
which
enter
into
manufactures
of
all
sorts
all
duty
paid
upon
such
articles
goes
directly
to
the
cost
of
the
article
when
manufactured
here
and
must
be
paid
for
by
the
consumers
these
duties
not
only
come
from
the
consumers
at
home
but
act
as
a
protection
to
foreign
manufacturers
of
the
same
completed
articles
in
our
own
and
distant
markets
i
will
suggest
or
mention
another
subject
bearing
upon
the
problem
of
how
to
enable
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
accumulate
balances
it
is
to
devise
some
better
method
of
verifying
claims
against
the
government
than
at
present
exists
through
the
court
of
claims
especially
those
claims
growing
out
of
the
late
war
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
amounts
passed
and
paid
are
either
wholly
fraudulent
or
are
far
in
excess
of
the
real
losses
sustained
the
large
amount
of
losses
provenon
good
testimony
according
to
existing
laws
by
affidavits
of
fictitious
or
unscrupulous
personsto
have
been
sustained
on
small
farms
and
plantations
are
not
only
far
beyond
the
possible
yield
of
those
places
for
any
one
year
but
as
everyone
knows
who
has
had
experience
in
tilling
the
soil
and
who
has
visited
the
scenes
of
these
spoliations
are
in
many
instances
more
than
the
individual
claimants
were
ever
worth
including
their
personal
and
real
estate
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
which
will
be
submitted
to
congress
at
an
early
day
will
contain
a
detailed
history
of
awards
made
and
of
claim
pending
of
the
class
here
referred
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
accompanying
this
message
gives
a
detailed
account
of
army
operations
for
the
year
just
passed
expenses
for
maintenance
etc
with
recommendations
for
legislation
to
which
i
respectfully
invite
your
attention
to
some
of
these
i
invite
special
attention
first
the
necessity
of
making
of
the
appropriation
for
the
subsistence
department
available
before
the
beginning
of
the
next
fiscal
year
without
this
provision
troops
at
points
distant
from
supply
production
must
either
go
without
food
or
existing
laws
must
be
violated
it
is
not
attended
with
cost
to
the
treasury
second
his
recommendation
for
the
enactment
of
a
system
of
annuities
for
the
families
of
deceased
officers
by
voluntary
deductions
from
the
monthly
pay
of
officers
this
again
is
not
attended
with
burden
upon
the
treasury
and
would
for
the
future
relieve
much
distress
which
every
old
army
officer
has
witnessed
in
the
pastof
officers
dying
suddenly
or
being
killed
leaving
families
without
even
the
means
of
reaching
their
friends
if
fortunate
enough
to
have
friends
to
aid
them
third
the
repeal
of
the
law
abolishing
mileage
and
a
return
to
the
old
system
fourth
the
trial
with
torpedoes
under
the
corps
of
engineers
and
appropriation
for
the
same
should
war
ever
occur
between
the
united
states
and
any
maritime
power
torpedoes
will
be
among
if
not
the
most
effective
and
cheapest
auxiliary
for
the
defense
of
harbors
and
also
in
aggressive
operations
that
we
can
have
hence
it
is
advisable
to
learn
by
experiment
their
best
construction
and
application
as
well
as
effect
fifth
a
permanent
organization
for
the
signalservice
corps
this
service
has
now
become
a
necessity
of
peace
as
well
as
war
under
the
advancement
made
by
the
present
able
management
sixth
a
renewal
of
the
appropriation
for
compiling
the
official
records
of
the
war
etc
the
condition
of
our
navy
at
this
time
is
a
subject
of
satisfaction
it
does
not
contain
it
is
true
any
of
the
powerful
cruising
ironclads
which
make
so
much
of
the
maritime
strength
of
some
other
nations
but
neither
our
continental
situation
nor
our
foreign
policy
requires
that
we
should
have
a
large
number
of
ships
of
this
character
while
this
situation
and
the
nature
of
our
ports
combine
to
make
those
of
other
nations
little
dangerous
to
us
under
any
circumstances
our
navy
does
contain
however
a
considerable
number
of
ironclads
of
the
monitor
class
which
though
not
properly
cruisers
are
powerful
and
effective
for
harbor
defense
and
for
operations
near
our
own
shores
of
these
all
the
singleturreted
ones
fifteen
in
number
have
been
substantially
rebuilt
their
rotten
wooden
beams
replaced
with
iron
their
hulls
strengthened
and
their
engines
and
machinery
thoroughly
repaired
so
that
they
are
now
in
the
most
efficient
condition
and
ready
for
sea
as
soon
as
they
can
be
manned
and
put
in
commission
the
five
doubleturreted
ironclads
belonging
to
our
navy
by
far
the
most
powerful
of
our
ships
for
fighting
purposes
are
also
in
hand
undergoing
complete
repairs
and
could
be
ready
for
sea
in
periods
varying
from
four
to
six
months
with
these
completed
according
to
the
present
design
and
our
two
iron
torpedo
boats
now
ready
our
ironclad
fleet
will
be
for
the
purposes
of
defense
at
home
equal
to
any
force
that
can
readily
be
brought
against
it
of
our
wooden
navy
also
cruisers
of
various
sizes
to
the
number
of
about
forty
including
those
now
in
commission
are
in
the
atlantic
and
could
be
ready
for
duty
as
fast
as
men
could
be
enlisted
for
those
not
already
in
commission
of
these
onethird
are
in
effect
new
ships
and
though
some
of
the
remainder
need
considerable
repairs
to
their
boilers
and
machinery
they
all
are
or
can
readily
be
made
effective
this
constitutes
a
fleet
of
more
than
fifty
war
ships
of
which
fifteen
are
ironclad
now
in
hand
on
the
atlantic
coast
the
navy
has
been
brought
to
this
condition
by
a
judicious
and
practical
application
of
what
could
be
spared
from
the
current
appropriations
of
the
last
few
years
and
from
that
made
to
meet
the
possible
emergency
of
two
years
ago
it
has
been
done
quietly
without
proclamation
or
display
and
though
it
has
necessarily
straitened
the
department
in
its
ordinary
expenditure
and
as
far
as
the
ironclads
are
concerned
has
added
nothing
to
the
cruising
force
of
the
navy
yet
the
result
is
not
the
less
satisfactory
because
it
is
to
be
found
in
a
great
increase
of
real
rather
than
apparent
force
the
expenses
incurred
in
the
maintenance
of
an
effective
naval
force
in
all
its
branches
are
necessarily
large
but
such
force
is
essential
to
our
position
relations
and
character
and
affects
seriously
the
weight
of
our
principles
and
policy
throughout
the
whole
sphere
of
national
responsibilities
the
estimates
for
the
regular
support
of
this
branch
of
the
service
for
the
next
year
amount
to
a
little
less
in
the
aggregate
than
those
made
for
the
current
year
but
some
additional
appropriations
are
asked
for
objects
not
included
in
the
ordinary
maintenance
of
the
navy
but
believed
to
be
of
pressing
importance
at
this
time
it
would
in
my
opinion
be
wise
at
once
to
afford
sufficient
means
for
the
immediate
completion
of
the
five
doubleturreted
monitors
now
undergoing
repairs
which
must
otherwise
advance
slowly
and
only
as
money
can
be
spared
from
current
expenses
supplemented
by
these
our
navy
armed
with
the
destructive
weapons
of
modern
warfare
manned
by
our
seamen
and
in
charge
of
our
instructed
officers
will
present
a
force
powerful
for
the
home
purposes
of
a
responsible
though
peaceful
nation
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
herewith
transmitted
gives
a
full
history
of
the
workings
of
the
department
for
the
year
just
past
it
will
be
observed
that
the
deficiency
to
be
supplied
from
the
general
treasury
is
increased
over
the
amount
required
for
the
preceding
year
in
a
country
so
vast
in
area
as
the
united
states
with
large
portions
sparsely
settled
it
must
be
expected
that
this
important
service
will
be
more
or
less
a
burden
upon
the
treasury
for
many
years
to
come
but
there
is
no
branch
of
the
public
service
which
interests
the
whole
people
more
than
that
of
cheap
and
rapid
transmission
of
the
mails
to
every
inhabited
part
of
our
territory
next
to
the
free
school
the
postoffice
is
the
great
educator
of
the
people
and
it
may
well
receive
the
support
of
the
general
government
the
subsidy
of
per
annum
given
to
vessels
of
the
united
states
for
carrying
the
mails
between
new
york
and
rio
de
janeiro
having
ceased
on
the
th
day
of
september
last
we
are
without
direct
mail
facilities
with
the
south
american
states
this
is
greatly
to
be
regretted
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
recommend
the
authorization
of
a
renewal
of
that
contract
and
also
that
the
service
may
be
increased
from
monthly
to
semimonthly
trips
the
commercial
advantages
to
be
gained
by
a
direct
line
of
american
steamers
to
the
south
american
states
will
far
outweigh
the
expense
of
the
service
by
act
of
congress
approved
march
almost
all
matter
whether
properly
mail
matter
or
not
may
be
sent
any
distance
through
the
mails
in
packages
not
exceeding
pounds
in
weight
for
the
sum
of
cents
per
pound
so
far
as
the
transmission
of
real
mail
matter
goes
this
would
seem
entirely
proper
but
i
suggest
that
the
law
be
so
amended
as
to
exclude
from
the
mails
merchandise
of
all
descriptions
and
limit
this
transportation
to
articles
enumerated
and
which
may
be
classed
as
mail
matter
proper
the
discovery
of
gold
in
the
black
hills
a
portion
of
the
sioux
reservation
has
had
the
effect
to
induce
a
large
emigration
of
miners
to
that
point
thus
far
the
effort
to
protect
the
treaty
rights
of
the
indians
to
that
section
has
been
successful
but
the
next
year
will
certainly
witness
a
large
increase
of
such
emigration
the
negotiations
for
the
relinquishment
of
the
gold
fields
having
failed
it
will
be
necessary
for
congress
to
adopt
some
measures
to
relieve
the
embarrassment
growing
out
of
the
causes
named
the
secretary
of
the
interior
suggests
that
the
supplies
now
appropriated
for
the
sustenance
of
that
people
being
no
longer
obligatory
under
the
treaty
of
but
simply
a
gratuity
may
be
issued
o
r
withheld
at
his
discretion
the
condition
of
the
indian
territory
to
which
i
have
referred
in
several
of
my
former
annual
messages
remains
practically
unchanged
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
taken
measures
to
obtain
a
full
report
of
the
condition
of
that
territory
and
will
make
it
the
subject
of
a
special
report
at
an
early
day
it
may
then
be
necessary
to
make
some
further
recommendation
in
regard
to
legislation
for
the
government
of
that
territory
the
steady
growth
and
increase
of
the
business
of
the
patent
office
indicates
in
some
measure
the
progress
of
the
industrial
activity
of
the
country
the
receipts
of
the
office
are
in
excess
of
its
expenditures
and
the
office
generally
is
in
a
prosperous
and
satisfactory
condition
the
report
of
the
general
land
office
shows
that
there
were
acres
less
disposed
of
during
this
than
during
the
last
year
more
than
onehalf
of
this
decrease
was
in
lands
disposed
of
under
the
homestead
and
timberculture
laws
the
cause
of
this
decrease
is
supposed
to
be
found
in
the
grasshopper
scourge
and
the
droughts
which
prevailed
so
extensively
in
some
of
the
frontier
states
and
territories
during
that
time
as
to
discourage
and
deter
entries
by
actual
settlers
the
cash
receipts
were
less
by
than
during
the
preceding
year
the
entire
surveyed
area
of
the
public
domain
is
acres
of
which
acres
were
surveyed
during
the
past
year
leaving
acres
still
unsurveyed
the
report
of
the
commissioner
presents
many
interesting
suggestions
in
regard
to
the
management
and
disposition
of
the
public
domain
and
the
modification
of
existing
laws
the
apparent
importance
of
which
should
insure
for
them
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
the
number
of
pensioners
still
continues
to
decrease
the
highest
number
having
been
reached
during
the
year
ending
june
during
the
last
year
names
were
added
to
the
rolls
and
were
dropped
therefrom
showing
a
net
decrease
of
but
while
the
number
of
pensioners
has
decreased
the
annual
amount
due
on
the
pension
rolls
has
increased
this
is
caused
by
the
greatly
increased
average
rate
of
pensions
which
by
the
liberal
legislation
of
congress
has
increased
from
in
to
in
to
each
invalid
pensioner
an
increase
in
the
average
rate
of
per
cent
in
the
three
years
during
the
year
ending
june
there
was
paid
on
account
of
pensions
including
the
expenses
of
disbursement
being
less
than
was
paid
the
preceding
year
this
reduction
in
amount
of
expenditures
was
produced
by
the
decrease
in
the
amount
of
arrearages
due
on
allowed
claims
and
on
pensions
the
rate
of
which
was
increased
by
the
legislation
of
the
preceding
session
of
congress
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
there
were
on
the
pension
rolls
persons
of
whom
were
army
pensioners
being
invalids
and
widows
and
dependent
relatives
were
navy
pensioners
of
whom
were
invalids
and
widows
and
dependent
relatives
were
pensioners
of
the
war
of
of
whom
were
survivors
and
were
widows
it
is
estimated
that
will
be
required
for
the
payment
of
pensions
for
the
next
fiscal
year
an
amount
less
than
the
estimate
for
the
present
year
the
geological
explorations
have
been
prosecuted
with
energy
during
the
year
covering
an
area
of
about
square
miles
in
the
territories
of
colorado
utah
and
new
mexico
developing
the
agricultural
and
mineral
resources
and
furnishing
interesting
scientific
and
topographical
details
of
that
region
the
method
for
the
treatment
of
the
indians
adopted
at
the
beginning
of
my
first
term
has
been
steadily
pursued
and
with
satisfactory
and
encouraging
results
it
has
been
productive
of
evident
improvement
in
the
condition
of
that
race
and
will
be
continued
with
only
such
modifications
as
further
experience
may
indicate
to
be
necessary
the
board
heretofore
appointed
to
take
charge
of
the
articles
and
materials
pertaining
to
the
war
the
navy
the
treasury
the
interior
and
the
postoffice
departments
and
the
department
of
agriculture
the
smithsonian
institution
and
the
commission
of
food
fishes
to
be
contributed
under
the
legislation
of
last
session
to
the
international
exhibition
to
be
held
at
philadelphia
during
the
centennial
year
has
been
diligent
in
the
discharge
of
the
duties
which
have
devolved
upon
it
and
the
preparations
so
far
made
with
the
means
at
command
give
assurance
that
the
governmental
contribution
will
be
made
one
of
the
marked
characteristics
of
the
exhibition
the
board
has
observed
commendable
economy
in
the
matter
of
the
erection
of
a
building
for
the
governmental
exhibit
the
expense
of
which
it
is
estimated
will
not
exceed
say
this
amount
has
been
withdrawn
under
the
law
from
the
appropriations
of
five
of
the
principal
departments
which
leaves
some
of
those
departments
without
sufficient
means
to
render
their
respective
practical
exhibits
complete
and
satisfactory
the
exhibition
being
an
international
one
and
the
government
being
a
voluntary
contributor
it
is
my
opinion
that
its
contribution
should
be
of
a
character
in
quality
and
extent
to
sustain
the
dignity
and
credit
of
so
distinguished
a
contributor
the
advantages
to
the
country
of
a
creditable
display
are
in
an
international
point
of
view
of
the
first
importance
while
an
indifferent
or
uncreditable
participation
by
the
government
would
be
humiliating
to
the
patriotic
feelings
of
our
people
themselves
i
commend
the
estimates
of
the
board
for
the
necessary
additional
appropriations
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
the
powers
of
europe
almost
without
exception
many
of
the
south
american
states
and
even
the
more
distant
eastern
powers
have
manifested
their
friendly
sentiments
toward
the
united
states
and
the
interest
of
the
world
in
our
progress
by
taking
steps
to
join
with
us
in
celebrating
the
centennial
of
the
nation
and
i
strongly
recommend
that
a
more
national
importance
be
given
to
this
exhibition
by
such
legislation
and
by
such
appropriation
as
will
insure
its
success
its
value
in
bringing
to
our
shores
innumerable
useful
works
of
art
and
skill
the
commingling
of
the
citizens
of
foreign
countries
and
our
own
and
the
interchange
of
ideas
and
manufactures
will
far
exceed
any
pecuniary
outlay
we
may
make
i
transmit
herewith
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
together
with
the
reports
of
the
commissioners
the
board
of
audit
and
the
board
of
health
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
all
of
which
i
invite
your
attention
the
bureau
of
agriculture
has
accomplished
much
in
disseminating
useful
knowledge
to
the
agriculturist
and
also
in
introducing
new
and
useful
productions
adapted
to
our
soil
and
climate
and
is
worthy
of
the
continued
encouragement
of
the
government
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
education
which
accompanies
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shows
a
gratifying
progress
in
educational
matters
in
nearly
every
annual
message
that
i
have
had
the
honor
of
transmitting
to
congress
i
have
called
attention
to
the
anomalous
not
to
say
scandalous
condition
of
affairs
existing
in
the
territory
of
utah
and
have
asked
for
definite
legislation
to
correct
it
that
polygamy
should
exist
in
a
free
enlightened
and
christian
country
without
the
power
to
punish
so
flagrant
a
crime
against
decency
and
morality
seems
preposterous
true
there
is
no
law
to
sustain
this
unnatural
vice
but
what
is
needed
is
a
law
to
punish
it
as
a
crime
and
at
the
same
time
to
fix
the
status
of
the
innocent
children
the
offspring
of
this
system
and
of
the
possibly
innocent
plural
wives
but
as
an
institution
polygamy
should
be
banished
from
the
land
while
this
is
being
done
i
invite
the
attention
of
congress
to
another
though
perhaps
no
less
an
evilthe
importation
of
chinese
women
but
few
of
whom
are
brought
to
our
shores
to
pursue
honorable
or
useful
occupations
observations
while
visiting
the
territories
of
wyoming
utah
and
colorado
during
the
past
autumn
convinced
me
that
existing
laws
regulating
the
disposition
of
public
lands
timber
etc
and
probably
the
mining
laws
themselves
are
very
defective
and
should
be
carefully
amended
and
at
an
early
day
territory
where
cultivation
of
the
soil
can
only
be
followed
by
irrigation
and
where
irrigation
is
not
practicable
the
lands
can
only
be
used
as
pasturage
and
this
only
where
stock
can
reach
water
to
quench
its
thirst
can
not
be
governed
by
the
same
laws
as
to
entries
as
lands
every
acre
of
which
is
an
independent
estate
by
itself
land
must
be
held
in
larger
quantities
to
justify
the
expense
of
conducting
water
upon
it
to
make
it
fruitful
or
to
justify
utilizing
it
as
pasturage
the
timber
in
most
of
the
territories
is
principally
confined
to
the
mountain
regions
which
are
held
for
entry
in
small
quantities
only
and
as
mineral
lands
the
timber
is
the
property
of
the
united
states
for
the
disposal
of
which
there
is
now
no
adequate
law
the
settler
must
become
a
consumer
of
this
timber
whether
he
lives
upon
the
plain
or
engages
in
working
the
mines
hence
every
man
becomes
either
a
trespasser
himself
or
knowingly
a
patron
of
trespassers
my
opportunities
for
observation
were
not
sufficient
to
justify
me
in
recommending
specific
legislation
on
these
subjects
but
i
do
recommend
that
a
joint
committee
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
sufficiently
large
to
be
divided
into
subcommittees
be
organized
to
visit
all
the
mining
states
and
territories
during
the
coming
summer
and
that
the
committee
shall
report
to
congress
at
the
next
session
such
laws
or
amendments
to
laws
as
it
may
deem
necessary
to
secure
the
best
interests
of
the
government
and
the
people
of
these
territories
who
are
doing
so
much
for
their
development
i
am
sure
the
citizens
occupying
the
territory
described
do
not
wish
to
be
trespassers
nor
will
they
be
if
legal
ways
are
provided
for
them
to
become
owners
of
these
actual
necessities
of
their
position
as
this
will
be
the
last
annual
message
which
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
transmitting
to
congress
before
my
successor
is
chosen
i
will
repeat
or
recapitulate
the
questions
which
i
deem
of
vital
importance
which
may
be
legislated
upon
and
settled
at
this
session
first
that
the
states
shall
be
required
to
afford
the
opp
ortunity
of
a
good
commonschool
education
to
every
child
within
their
limits
second
no
sectarian
tenets
shall
ever
be
taught
in
any
school
supported
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
state
nation
or
by
the
proceeds
of
any
tax
levied
upon
any
community
make
education
compulsory
so
far
as
to
deprive
all
persons
who
can
not
read
and
write
from
becoming
voters
after
the
year
disfranchising
none
however
on
grounds
of
illiteracy
who
may
be
voters
at
the
time
this
amendment
takes
effect
third
declare
church
and
state
forever
separate
and
distinct
but
each
free
within
their
proper
spheres
and
that
all
church
property
shall
bear
its
own
proportion
of
taxation
fourth
drive
out
licensed
immorality
such
as
polygamy
and
the
importation
of
women
for
illegitimate
purposes
to
recur
again
to
the
centennial
year
it
would
seem
as
though
now
as
we
are
about
to
begin
the
second
century
of
our
national
existence
would
be
a
most
fitting
time
for
these
reforms
fifth
enact
such
laws
as
will
insure
a
speedy
return
to
a
sound
currency
such
as
will
command
the
respect
of
the
world
believing
that
these
views
will
commend
themselves
to
the
great
majority
of
the
rightthinking
and
patriotic
citizens
of
the
united
states
i
submit
the
rest
to
congress
u
s
grant

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
since
the
convening
of
congress
one
year
ago
the
nation
has
undergone
a
prostration
in
business
and
industries
such
as
has
not
been
witnessed
with
us
for
many
years
speculation
as
to
the
causes
for
this
prostration
might
be
indulged
in
without
profit
because
as
many
theories
would
be
advanced
as
there
would
be
independent
writersthose
who
expressed
their
own
views
without
borrowingupon
the
subject
without
indulging
in
theories
as
to
the
cause
of
this
prostration
therefore
i
will
call
your
attention
only
to
the
fact
and
to
some
plain
questions
as
to
which
it
would
seem
there
should
be
no
disagreement
during
this
prostration
two
essential
elements
of
prosperity
have
been
most
abundantlabor
and
capital
both
have
been
largely
unemployed
where
security
has
been
undoubted
capital
has
been
attainable
at
very
moderate
rates
where
labor
has
been
wanted
it
has
been
found
in
abundance
at
cheap
rates
compared
with
whatof
necessaries
and
comforts
of
lifecould
be
purchased
with
the
wages
demanded
two
great
elements
of
prosperity
therefore
have
not
been
denied
us
a
third
might
be
added
our
soil
and
climate
are
unequaled
within
the
limits
of
any
contiguous
territory
under
one
nationality
for
its
variety
of
products
to
feed
and
clothe
a
people
and
in
the
amount
of
surplus
to
spare
to
feed
less
favored
peoples
therefore
with
these
facts
in
view
it
seems
to
me
that
wise
statesmanship
at
this
session
of
congress
would
dictate
legislation
ignoring
the
past
directing
in
proper
channels
these
great
elements
of
prosperity
to
any
people
debt
debt
abroad
is
the
only
element
that
can
with
always
a
sound
currency
enter
into
our
affairs
to
cause
any
continued
depression
in
the
industries
and
prosperity
of
our
people
a
great
conflict
for
national
existence
made
necessary
for
temporary
purposes
the
raising
of
large
sums
of
money
from
whatever
source
attainable
it
made
it
necessary
in
the
wisdom
of
congressand
i
do
not
doubt
their
wisdom
in
the
premises
regarding
the
necessity
of
the
timesto
devise
a
system
of
national
currency
which
it
proved
to
be
impossible
to
keep
on
a
par
with
the
recognized
currency
of
the
civilized
world
this
begot
a
spirit
of
speculation
involving
an
extravagance
and
luxury
not
required
for
the
happiness
or
prosperity
of
a
people
and
involving
both
directly
and
indirectly
foreign
indebtedness
the
currency
being
of
fluctuating
value
and
therefore
unsafe
to
hold
for
legitimate
transactions
requiring
money
became
a
subject
of
speculation
within
itself
these
two
causes
however
have
involved
us
in
a
foreign
indebtedness
contracted
in
good
faith
by
borrower
and
lender
which
should
be
paid
in
coin
and
according
to
the
bond
agreed
upon
when
the
debt
was
contractedgold
or
its
equivalent
the
good
faith
of
the
government
can
not
be
violated
toward
creditors
without
national
disgrace
but
our
commerce
should
be
encouraged
american
shipbuilding
and
carrying
capacity
increased
foreign
markets
sought
for
products
of
the
soil
and
manufactories
to
the
end
that
we
may
be
able
to
pay
these
debts
where
a
new
market
can
be
created
for
the
sale
of
our
products
either
of
the
soil
the
mine
or
the
manufactory
a
new
means
is
discovered
of
utilizing
our
idle
capital
and
labor
to
the
advantage
of
the
whole
people
but
in
my
judgment
the
first
step
toward
accomplishing
this
object
is
to
secure
a
currency
of
fixed
stable
value
a
currency
good
wherever
civilization
reigns
one
which
if
it
becomes
superabundant
with
one
people
will
find
a
market
with
some
other
a
currency
which
has
as
its
basis
the
labor
necessary
to
produce
it
which
will
give
to
it
its
value
gold
and
silver
are
now
the
recognized
medium
of
exchange
the
civilized
world
over
and
to
this
we
should
return
with
the
least
practicable
delay
in
view
of
the
pledges
of
the
american
congress
when
our
present
legaltender
system
was
adopted
and
debt
contracted
there
should
be
no
delaycertainly
no
unnecessary
delayin
fixing
by
legislation
a
method
by
which
we
will
return
to
specie
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
end
i
invite
your
special
attention
i
believe
firmly
that
there
can
be
no
prosperous
and
permanent
revival
of
business
and
industries
until
a
policy
is
adoptedwith
legislation
to
carry
it
outlooking
to
a
return
to
a
specie
basis
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
the
debtor
and
speculative
classes
may
think
it
of
value
to
them
to
make
socalled
money
abundant
until
they
can
throw
a
portion
of
their
burdens
upon
others
but
even
these
i
believe
would
be
disappointed
in
the
result
if
a
course
should
be
pursued
which
will
keep
in
doubt
the
value
of
the
legaltender
medium
of
exchange
a
revival
of
productive
industry
is
needed
by
all
classes
by
none
more
than
the
holders
of
property
of
whatever
sort
with
debts
to
liquidate
from
realization
upon
its
sale
but
admitting
that
these
two
classes
of
citizens
are
to
be
benefited
by
expansion
would
it
be
honest
to
give
it
would
not
the
general
loss
be
too
great
to
justify
such
relief
would
it
not
be
just
as
honest
and
prudent
to
authorize
each
debtor
to
issue
his
own
legaltenders
to
the
extent
of
his
liabilities
than
to
do
this
would
it
not
be
safer
for
fear
of
overissues
by
unscrupulous
creditors
to
say
that
all
debt
obligations
are
obliterated
in
the
united
states
and
now
we
commence
anew
each
possessing
all
he
has
at
the
time
free
from
incumbrance
these
propositions
are
too
absurd
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
by
thinking
or
honest
people
yet
every
delay
in
preparation
for
final
resumption
partakes
of
this
dishonesty
and
is
only
less
in
degree
as
the
hope
is
held
out
that
a
convenient
season
will
at
last
arrive
for
the
good
work
of
redeeming
our
pledges
to
commence
it
will
never
come
in
my
opinion
except
by
positive
action
by
congress
or
by
national
disasters
which
will
destroy
for
a
time
at
least
the
credit
of
the
individual
and
the
state
at
large
a
sound
currency
might
be
reached
by
total
bankruptcy
and
discredit
of
the
integrity
of
the
nation
and
of
individuals
i
believe
it
is
in
the
power
of
congress
at
this
session
to
devise
such
legislation
as
will
renew
confidence
revive
all
the
industries
start
us
on
a
career
of
prosperity
to
last
for
many
years
and
to
save
the
credit
of
the
nation
and
of
the
people
steps
toward
the
return
to
a
specie
basis
are
the
great
requisites
to
this
devoutly
to
be
sought
for
end
there
are
others
which
i
may
touch
upon
hereafter
a
nation
dealing
in
a
currency
below
that
of
specie
in
value
labors
under
two
great
disadvantages
first
having
no
use
for
the
worlds
acknowledged
medium
of
exchange
gold
and
silver
these
are
driven
out
of
the
country
because
there
is
no
need
for
their
use
second
the
medium
of
exchange
in
use
being
of
a
fluctuating
valuefor
after
all
it
is
only
worth
just
what
it
will
purchase
of
gold
and
silver
metals
having
an
intrinsic
value
just
in
proportion
to
the
honest
labor
it
takes
to
produce
thema
larger
margin
must
be
allowed
for
profit
by
the
manufacturer
and
producer
it
is
months
from
the
date
of
production
to
the
date
of
realization
interest
upon
capital
must
be
charged
and
risk
of
fluctuation
in
the
value
of
that
which
is
to
be
received
in
payment
added
hence
high
prices
acting
as
a
protection
to
the
foreign
producer
who
receives
nothing
in
exchange
for
the
products
of
his
skill
and
labor
except
a
currency
good
at
a
stable
value
the
world
over
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
is
clearer
than
that
the
greater
part
of
the
burden
of
existing
prostration
for
the
want
of
a
sound
financial
system
falls
upon
the
working
man
who
must
after
all
produce
the
wealth
and
the
salaried
man
who
superintends
and
conducts
business
the
burden
falls
upon
them
in
two
waysby
the
deprivation
of
employment
and
by
the
decreased
purchasing
power
of
their
salaries
it
is
the
duty
of
congress
to
devise
the
method
of
correcting
the
evils
which
are
acknowledged
to
exist
and
not
mine
but
i
will
venture
to
suggest
two
or
three
things
which
seem
to
me
as
absolutely
necessary
to
a
return
to
specie
payments
the
first
great
requisite
in
a
return
to
prosperity
the
legaltender
clause
to
the
law
authorizing
the
issue
of
currency
by
the
national
government
should
be
repealed
to
take
effect
as
to
all
contracts
entered
into
after
a
day
fixed
in
the
repealing
actnot
to
apply
however
to
payments
of
salaries
by
government
or
for
other
expenditures
now
provided
by
law
to
be
paid
in
currency
in
the
interval
pending
between
repeal
and
final
resumption
provision
should
be
made
by
which
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
can
obtain
gold
as
it
may
become
necessary
from
time
to
time
from
the
date
when
specie
redemption
commences
to
this
might
and
should
be
added
a
revenue
sufficiently
in
excess
of
expenses
to
insure
an
accumulation
of
gold
in
the
treasury
to
sustain
permanent
redemption
i
commend
this
subject
to
your
careful
consideration
believing
that
a
favorable
solution
is
attainable
and
if
reached
by
this
congress
that
the
present
and
future
generations
will
ever
gratefully
remember
it
as
their
deliverer
from
a
thraldom
of
evil
and
disgrace
with
resumption
free
banking
may
be
authorized
with
safety
giving
the
same
full
protection
to
bill
holders
which
they
have
under
existing
laws
indeed
i
would
regard
free
banking
as
essential
it
would
give
proper
elasticity
to
the
currency
as
more
currency
should
be
required
for
the
transaction
of
legitimate
business
new
banks
would
be
started
and
in
turn
banks
would
wind
up
their
business
when
it
was
found
that
there
was
a
superabundance
of
currency
the
experience
and
judgment
of
the
people
can
best
decide
just
how
much
currency
is
required
for
the
transaction
of
the
business
of
the
country
it
is
unsafe
to
leave
the
settlement
of
this
question
to
congress
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
the
executive
congress
should
make
the
regulation
under
which
banks
may
exist
but
should
not
make
banking
a
monopoly
by
limiting
the
amount
of
redeemable
paper
currency
that
shall
be
authorized
such
importance
do
i
attach
to
this
subject
and
so
earnestly
do
i
commend
it
to
your
attention
that
i
give

it
prominence
by
introducing
it
at
the
beginning
of
this
message
during
the
past
year
nothing
has
occurred
to
disturb
the
general
friendly
and
cordial
relations
of
the
united
states
with
other
powers
the
correspondence
submitted
herewith
between
this
government
and
its
diplomatic
representatives
as
also
with
the
representatives
of
other
countries
shows
a
satisfactory
condition
of
all
questions
between
the
united
states
and
the
most
of
those
countries
and
with
few
exceptions
to
which
reference
is
hereafter
made
the
absence
of
any
points
of
difference
to
be
adjusted
the
notice
directed
by
the
resolution
of
congress
of
june
to
be
given
to
terminate
the
convention
of
july
between
the
united
states
and
belgium
has
been
given
and
the
treaty
will
accordingly
terminate
on
the
st
day
of
july
this
convention
secured
to
certain
belgian
vessels
entering
the
ports
of
the
united
states
exceptional
privileges
which
are
not
accorded
to
our
own
vessels
other
features
of
the
convention
have
proved
satisfactory
and
have
tended
to
the
cultivation
of
mutually
beneficial
commercial
intercourse
and
friendly
relations
between
the
two
countries
i
hope
that
negotiations
which
have
been
invited
will
result
in
the
celebration
of
another
treaty
which
may
tend
to
the
interests
of
both
countries
our
relations
with
china
continue
to
be
friendly
during
the
past
year
the
fear
of
hostilities
between
china
and
japan
growing
out
of
the
landing
of
an
armed
force
upon
the
island
of
formosa
by
the
latter
has
occasioned
uneasiness
it
is
earnestly
hoped
however
that
the
difficulties
arising
from
this
cause
will
be
adjusted
and
that
the
advance
of
civilization
in
these
empires
may
not
be
retarded
by
a
state
of
war
in
consequence
of
the
part
taken
by
certain
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
this
expedition
our
representatives
in
those
countries
have
been
instructed
to
impress
upon
the
governments
of
china
and
japan
the
firm
intention
of
this
country
to
maintain
strict
neutrality
in
the
event
of
hostilities
and
to
carefully
prevent
any
infraction
of
law
on
the
part
of
our
citizens
in
connection
with
this
subject
i
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
a
generally
conceded
factthat
the
great
proportion
of
the
chinese
immigrants
who
come
to
our
shores
do
not
come
voluntarily
to
make
their
homes
with
us
and
their
labor
productive
of
general
prosperity
but
come
under
contracts
with
headmen
who
own
them
almost
absolutely
in
a
worse
form
does
this
apply
to
chinese
women
hardly
a
perceptible
percentage
of
them
perform
any
honorable
labor
but
they
are
brought
for
shameful
purposes
to
the
disgrace
of
the
communities
where
settled
and
to
the
great
demoralization
of
the
youth
of
those
localities
if
this
evil
practice
can
be
legislated
against
it
will
be
my
pleasure
as
well
as
duty
to
enforce
any
regulation
to
secure
so
desirable
an
end
it
is
hoped
that
negotiations
between
the
government
of
japan
and
the
treaty
powers
looking
to
the
further
opening
of
the
empire
and
to
the
removal
of
various
restrictions
upon
trade
and
travel
may
soon
produce
the
results
desired
which
can
not
fail
to
inure
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
parties
having
on
previous
occasions
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
propriety
of
the
release
of
the
japanese
government
from
the
further
payment
of
the
indemnity
under
the
convention
of
october
and
as
no
action
had
been
taken
thereon
it
became
my
duty
to
regard
the
obligations
of
the
convention
as
in
force
and
as
the
other
powers
interested
had
received
their
portion
of
the
indemnity
in
full
the
minister
of
the
united
states
in
japan
has
in
behalf
of
this
government
received
the
remainder
of
the
amount
due
to
the
united
states
under
the
convention
of
simonosaki
i
submit
the
propriety
of
applying
the
income
of
a
part
if
not
of
the
whole
of
this
fund
to
the
education
in
the
japanese
language
of
a
number
of
young
men
to
be
under
obligations
to
serve
the
government
for
a
specified
time
as
interpreters
at
the
legation
and
the
consulates
in
japan
a
limited
number
of
japanese
youths
might
at
the
same
time
be
educated
in
our
own
vernacular
and
mutual
benefits
would
result
to
both
governments
the
importance
of
having
our
own
citizens
competent
and
familiar
with
the
language
of
japan
to
act
as
interpreters
and
in
other
capacities
connected
with
the
legation
and
the
consulates
in
that
country
can
not
readily
be
overestimated
the
amount
awarded
to
the
government
of
great
britain
by
the
mixed
commission
organized
under
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
washington
in
settlement
of
the
claims
of
british
subjects
arising
from
acts
committed
between
april
and
april
became
payable
under
the
terms
of
the
treaty
within
the
past
year
and
was
paid
upon
the
st
day
of
september
in
this
connection
i
renew
my
recommendation
made
at
the
opening
of
the
last
session
of
congress
that
a
special
court
be
created
to
hear
and
determine
all
claims
of
aliens
against
the
united
states
arising
from
acts
committed
against
their
persons
or
property
during
the
insurrection
it
appears
equitable
that
opportunity
should
be
offered
to
citizens
of
other
states
to
present
their
claims
as
well
as
to
those
british
subjects
whose
claims
were
not
admissible
under
the
late
commission
to
the
early
decision
of
some
competent
tribunal
to
this
end
i
recommend
the
necessary
legislation
to
organize
a
court
to
dispose
of
all
claims
of
aliens
of
the
nature
referred
to
in
an
equitable
and
satisfactory
manner
and
to
relieve
congress
and
the
departments
from
the
consideration
of
these
questions
the
legislation
necessary
to
extend
to
the
colony
of
newfoundland
certain
articles
of
the
treaty
of
washington
of
the
th
day
of
may
having
been
had
a
protocol
to
that
effect
was
signed
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
of
great
britain
on
the
th
day
of
may
last
and
was
duly
proclaimed
on
the
following
day
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
is
submitted
herewith
a
copy
of
the
report
of
the
commissioner
appointed
under
the
act
of
march
for
surveying
and
marking
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
possessions
from
the
lake
of
the
woods
to
the
summit
of
the
rocky
mountains
is
herewith
transmitted
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
the
field
work
of
the
commission
has
been
completed
and
the
entire
line
from
the
northwest
corner
of
the
lake
of
the
woods
to
the
summit
of
the
rocky
mountains
has
been
run
and
marked
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
is
believed
that
the
amount
remaining
unexpended
of
the
appropriation
made
at
the
last
session
of
congress
will
be
sufficient
to
complete
the
office
work
i
recommend
that
the
authority
of
congress
be
given
to
the
use
of
the
unexpended
balance
of
the
appropriation
in
the
completion
of
the
work
of
the
commission
in
making
its
report
and
preparing
the
necessary
maps
the
court
known
as
the
court
of
commissioners
of
alabama
claims
created
by
an
act
of
congress
of
the
last
session
has
organized
and
commenced
its
work
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
claims
admissible
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
may
be
speedily
ascertained
and
paid
it
has
been
deemed
advisable
to
exercise
the
discretion
conferred
upon
the
executive
at
the
last
session
by
accepting
the
conditions
required
by
the
government
of
turkey
for
the
privilege
of
allowing
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
hold
real
estate
in
the
former
country
and
by
assenting
to
a
certain
change
in
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
in
the
latter
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
upon
these
subjects
is
herewith
communicated
there
has
been
no
material
change
in
our
relations
with
the
independent
states
of
this
hemisphere
which
were
formerly
under
the
dominion
of
spain
marauding
on
the
frontiers
between
mexico
and
texas
still
frequently
takes
place
despite
the
vigilance
of
the
civil
and
military
authorities
in
that
quarter
the
difficulty
of
checking
such
trespasses
along
the
course
of
a
river
of
such
length
as
the
rio
grande
and
so
often
fordable
is
obvious
it
is
hoped
that
the
efforts
of
this
government
will
be
seconded
by
those
of
mexico
to
the
effectual
suppression
of
these
acts
of
wrong
from
a
report
upon
the
condition
of
the
business
before
the
american
and
mexican
joint
claims
commission
made
by
the
agent
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
and
dated
october
it
appears
that
of
the
claims
filed
on
the
part
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
had
been
finally
decided
and
were
in
the
hands
of
the
umpire
leaving
to
be
disposed
of
and
of
the
claims
filed
against
the
united
states
had
been
finally
decided
i
was
before
the
umpire
and
remained
to
be
disposed
of
since
the
date
of
such
report
other
claims
have
been
disposed
of
reducing
somewhat
the
number
still
pending
and
others
have
been
passed
upon
by
the
arbitrators
it
has
become
apparent
in
view
of
these
figures
and
of
the
fact
that
the
work
devolving
on
the
umpire
is
particularly
laborious
that
the
commission
will
be
unable
to
dispose
of
the
entire
number
of
claims
pending
prior
to
the
st
day
of
february
the
date
fixed
for
its
expiration
negotiations
are
pending
looking
to
the
securing
of
the
results
of
the
decisions
which
have
been
reached
and
to
a
further
extension
of
the
commission
for
a
limited
time
which
it
is
confidently
hoped
will
suffice
to
bring
all
the
business
now
before
it
to
a
final
close
the
strife
in
the
argentine
republic
is
to
be
deplored
both
on
account
of
the
parties
thereto
and
from
the
probable
effects
on
the
interests
of
those
engaged
in
the
trade
to
that
quarter
of
whom
the
united
states
are
among
the
principal
as
yet
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there
has
been
no
violation
of
our
neutrality
rights
which
as
well
as
our
duties
in
that
respect
it
shall
be
my
endeavor
to
maintain
and
observe
it
is
with
regret
i
announce
that
no
further
payment
has
been
received
from
the
government
of
venezuela
on
account
of
awards
in
favor
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
hopes
have
been
entertained
that
if
that
republic
could
escape
both
foreign
and
civil
war
for
a
few
years
its
great
natural
resources
would
enable
it
to
honor
its
obligations
though
it
is
now
understood
to
be
at
peace
with
other
countries
a
seriou
s
insurrection
is
reported
to
be
in
progress
in
an
important
region
of
that
republic
this
may
be
taken
advantage
of
as
another
reason
to
delay
the
payment
of
the
dues
of
our
citizens
the
deplorable
strife
in
cuba
continues
without
any
marked
change
in
the
relative
advantages
of
the
contending
forces
the
insurrection
continues
but
spain
has
gained
no
superiority
six
years
of
strife
give
to
the
insurrection
a
significance
which
can
not
be
denied
its
duration
and
the
tenacity
of
its
adherence
together
with
the
absence
of
manifested
power
of
suppression
on
the
part
of
spain
can
not
be
controverted
and
may
make
some
positive
steps
on
the
part
of
other
powers
a
matter
of
selfnecessity
i
had
confidently
hoped
at
this
time
to
be
able
to
announce
the
arrangement
of
some
of
the
important
questions
between
this
government
and
that
of
spain
but
the
negotiations
have
been
protracted
the
unhappy
intestine
dissensions
of
spain
command
our
profound
sympathy
and
must
be
accepted
as
perhaps
a
cause
of
some
delay
an
early
settlement
in
part
at
least
of
the
questions
between
the
governments
is
hoped
in
the
meantime
awaiting
the
results
of
immediately
pending
negotiations
i
defer
a
further
and
fuller
communication
on
the
subject
of
the
relations
of
this
country
and
spain
i
have
again
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
unsatisfactory
condition
of
the
existing
laws
with
reference
to
expatriation
and
the
election
of
nationality
formerly
amid
conflicting
opinions
and
decisions
it
was
difficult
to
exactly
determine
how
far
the
doctrine
of
perpetual
allegiance
was
applicable
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
congress
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
july
asserted
the
abstract
right
of
expatriation
as
a
fundamental
principle
of
this
government
notwithstanding
such
assertion
and
the
necessity
of
frequent
application
of
the
principle
no
legislation
has
been
had
defining
what
acts
or
formalities
shall
work
expatriation
or
when
a
citizen
shall
be
deemed
to
have
renounced
or
to
have
lost
his
citizenship
the
importance
of
such
definition
is
obvious
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
in
foreign
countries
are
continually
called
upon
to
lend
their
aid
and
the
protection
of
the
united
states
to
persons
concerning
the
good
faith
or
the
reality
of
whose
citizenship
there
is
at
least
great
question
in
some
cases
the
provisions
of
the
treaties
furnish
some
guide
in
others
it
seems
left
to
the
person
claiming
the
benefits
of
citizenship
while
living
in
a
foreign
country
contributing
in
no
manner
to
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
without
intention
at
any
time
to
return
and
undertake
those
duties
to
use
the
claims
to
citizenship
of
the
united
states
simply
as
a
shield
from
the
performance
of
the
obligations
of
a
citizen
elsewhere
the
status
of
children
born
of
american
parents
residing
in
a
foreign
country
of
american
women
who
have
married
aliens
of
american
citizens
residing
abroad
where
such
question
is
not
regulated
by
treaty
are
all
sources
of
frequent
difficulty
and
discussion
legislation
on
these
and
similar
questions
and
particularly
defining
when
and
under
what
circumstances
expatriation
can
be
accomplished
or
is
to
be
presumed
is
especially
needed
in
this
connection
i
earnestly
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
difficulties
arising
from
fraudulent
naturalization
the
united
states
wisely
freely
and
liberally
offers
its
citizenship
to
all
who
may
come
in
good
faith
to
reside
within
its
limits
on
their
complying
with
certain
prescribed
reasonable
and
simple
formalities
and
conditions
among
the
highest
duties
of
the
government
is
that
to
afford
firm
sufficient
and
equal
protection
to
all
its
citizens
whether
native
born
or
naturalized
care
should
be
taken
that
a
right
carrying
with
it
such
support
from
the
government
should
not
be
fraudulently
obtained
and
should
be
bestowed
only
upon
full
proof
of
a
compliance
with
the
law
and
yet
frequent
instances
are
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
government
of
illegal
and
fraudulent
naturalization
and
of
the
unauthorized
use
of
certificates
thus
improperly
obtained
in
some
cases
the
fraudulent
character
of
the
naturalization
has
appeared
upon
the
face
of
the
certificate
itself
in
others
examination
discloses
that
the
holder
had
not
complied
with
the
law
and
in
others
certificates
have
been
obtained
where
the
persons
holding
them
not
only
were
not
entitled
to
be
naturalized
but
had
not
even
been
within
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
the
pretended
naturalization
instances
of
each
of
these
classes
of
fraud
are
discovered
at
our
legations
where
the
certificates
of
naturalization
are
presented
either
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
passports
or
in
demanding
the
protection
of
the
legation
when
the
fraud
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
such
certificates
they
are
taken
up
by
the
representatives
of
the
government
and
forwarded
to
the
department
of
state
but
even
then
the
record
of
the
court
in
which
the
fraudulent
naturalization
occurred
remains
and
duplicate
certificates
are
readily
obtainable
upon
the
presentation
of
these
for
the
issue
of
passports
or
in
demanding
protection
of
the
government
the
fraud
sometimes
escapes
notice
and
such
certificates
are
not
infrequently
used
in
transactions
of
business
to
the
deception
and
injury
of
innocent
parties
without
placing
any
additional
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
obtainment
of
citizenship
by
the
worthy
and
wellintentioned
foreigner
who
comes
in
good
faith
to
cast
his
lot
with
ours
i
earnestly
recommend
further
legislation
to
punish
fraudulent
naturalization
and
to
secure
the
ready
cancellation
of
the
record
of
every
naturalization
made
in
fraud
since
my
last
annual
message
the
exchange
has
been
made
of
the
ratification
of
treaties
of
extradition
with
belgium
ecuador
peru
and
salvador
also
of
a
treaty
of
commerce
and
navigation
with
peru
and
one
of
commerce
and
consular
privileges
with
salvador
all
of
which
have
been
duly
proclaimed
as
has
also
a
declaration
with
russia
with
reference
to
trademarks
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
by
law
is
made
directly
to
congress
and
forms
no
part
of
this
message
will
show
the
receipts
and
expenditures
of
the
government
for
the
last
fiscal
year
the
amount
received
from
each
source
of
revenue
and
the
amount
paid
out
for
each
of
the
departments
of
government
it
will
be
observed
from
this
report
that
the
amount
of
receipts
over
expenditures
has
been
but
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
and
that
for
the
current
fiscal
year
the
estimated
receipts
over
expenditures
will
not
much
exceed
in
view
of
the
large
national
debt
existing
and
the
obligation
to
add
per
cent
per
annum
to
the
sinking
fund
a
sum
amounting
now
to
over
per
annum
i
submit
whether
revenues
should
not
be
increased
or
expenditures
diminished
to
reach
this
amount
of
surplus
not
to
provide
for
the
sinking
fund
is
a
partial
failure
to
comply
with
the
contracts
and
obligations
of
the
government
at
the
last
session
of
congress
a
very
considerable
reduction
was
made
in
rates
of
taxation
and
in
the
number
of
articles
submitted
to
taxation
the
question
may
well
be
asked
whether
or
not
in
some
instances
unwisely
in
connection
with
this
subject
too
i
venture
the
opinion
that
the
means
of
collecting
the
revenue
especially
from
imports
have
been
so
embarrassed
by
legislation
as
to
make
it
questionable
whether
or
not
large
amounts
are
not
lost
by
failure
to
collect
to
the
direct
loss
of
the
treasury
and
to
the
prejudice
of
the
interests
of
honest
importers
and
taxpayers
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
report
favors
legislation
looking
to
an
early
return
to
specie
payments
thus
supporting
views
previously
expressed
in
this
message
he
also
recommends
economy
in
appropriations
calls
attention
to
the
loss
of
revenue
from
repealing
the
tax
on
tea
and
coffee
without
benefit
to
the
consumer
recommends
an
increase
of
cents
a
gallon
on
whisky
and
further
that
no
modification
be
made
in
the
banking
and
currency
bill
passed
at
the
last
session
of
congress
unless
modification
should
become
necessary
by
reason
of
the
adoption
of
measures
for
returning
to
specie
payments
in
these
recommendations
i
cordially
join
i
would
suggest
to
congress
the
propriety
of
readjusting
the
tariff
so
as
to
increase
the
revenue
and
at
the
same
time
decrease
the
number
of
articles
upon
which
duties
are
levied
those
articles
which
enter
into
our
manufactures
and
are
not
produced
at
home
it
seems
to
me
should
be
entered
free
those
articles
of
manufacture
which
we
produce
a
constituent
part
of
but
do
not
produce
the
whole
that
part
which
we
do
not
produce
should
enter
free
also
i
will
instance
fine
wool
dyes
etc
these
articles
must
be
imported
to
form
a
part
of
the
manufacture
of
the
higher
grades
of
woolen
goods
chemicals
used
as
dyes
compounded
in
medicines
and
used
in
various
ways
in
manufactures
come
under
this
class
the
introduction
free
of
duty
of
such
wools
as
we
do
not
produce
would
stimulate
the
manufacture
of
goods
requiring
the
use
of
those
we
do
produce
and
therefore
would
be
a
benefit
to
home
production
there
are
many
articles
entering
into
home
manufactures
which
we
do
not
produce
ourselves
the
tariff
upon
which
increases
the
cost
of
producing
the
manufactured
article
all
corrections
in
this
regard
are
in
the
direction
of
bringing
labor
and
capital
in
harmony
with
each
other
and
of
supplying
one
of
the
elements
of
prosperity
so
much
needed
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
herewith
attached
and
forming
a
part
of
this
message
gives
all
the
information
concerning
the
operations
wants
and
necessities
of
the
army
and
contains
many
suggestions
and
recommendations
which
i
commend
to
your
special
attention
there
is
no
class
of
government
employees
who
are
harder
worked
than
the
armyofficers
and
men
none
who
perform
their
tasks
more
cheerfully
and
efficiently
and
under
circumstances
of
greater
privations
and
hardships
legislation
is
desirable
to
render
more
efficient
this
branch
of
the
public
service
all
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
war
i
regard
as
jud
icious
and
i
especially
commend
to
your
attention
the
following
the
consolidation
of
government
arsenals
the
restoration
of
mileage
to
officers
traveling
under
orders
the
exemption
of
money
received
from
the
sale
of
subsistence
stores
from
being
covered
into
the
treasury
the
use
of
appropriations
for
the
purchase
of
subsistence
stores
without
waiting
for
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
for
which
the
appropriation
is
made
for
additional
appropriations
for
the
collection
of
torpedo
material
for
increased
appropriations
for
the
manufacture
of
arms
for
relieving
the
various
states
from
indebtedness
for
arms
charged
to
them
during
the
rebellion
for
dropping
officers
from
the
rolls
of
the
army
without
trial
for
the
offense
of
drawing
pay
more
than
once
for
the
same
period
for
the
discouragement
of
the
plan
to
pay
soldiers
by
cheek
and
for
the
establishment
of
a
professorship
of
rhetoric
and
english
literature
at
west
point
the
reasons
for
these
recommendations
are
obvious
and
are
set
forth
sufficiently
in
the
reports
attached
i
also
recommend
that
the
status
of
the
staff
corps
of
the
army
be
fixed
where
this
has
not
already
been
done
so
that
promotions
may
be
made
and
vacancies
filled
as
they
occur
in
each
grade
when
reduced
below
the
number
to
be
fixed
by
law
the
necessity
for
such
legislation
is
specially
felt
now
in
the
pay
department
the
number
of
officers
in
that
department
is
below
the
number
adequate
to
the
performance
of
the
duties
required
of
them
by
law
the
efficiency
of
the
navy
has
been
largely
increased
during
the
last
year
under
the
impulse
of
the
foreign
complications
which
threatened
us
at
the
commencement
of
the
last
session
of
congress
most
of
our
efficient
wooden
ships
were
put
in
condition
for
immediate
service
and
the
repairs
of
our
ironclad
fleet
were
pushed
with
the
utmost
vigor
the
result
is
that
most
of
these
are
now
in
an
effective
state
and
need
only
to
be
manned
and
put
in
commission
to
go
at
once
into
service
some
of
the
new
sloops
authorized
by
congress
are
already
in
commission
and
most
of
the
remainder
are
launched
and
wait
only
the
completion
of
their
machinery
to
enable
them
to
take
their
places
as
part
of
our
effective
force
two
iron
torpedo
ships
have
been
completed
during
the
last
year
and
four
of
our
large
doubleturreted
ironclads
are
now
undergoing
repairs
when
these
are
finished
everything
that
is
useful
of
our
navy
as
now
authorized
will
be
in
condition
for
service
and
with
the
advance
in
the
science
of
torpedo
warfare
the
american
navy
comparatively
small
as
it
is
will
be
found
at
any
time
powerful
for
the
purposes
of
a
peaceful
nation
much
has
been
accomplished
during
the
year
in
aid
of
science
and
to
increase
the
sum
of
general
knowledge
and
further
the
interests
of
commerce
and
civilization
extensive
and
muchneeded
soundings
have
been
made
for
hydrographic
purposes
and
to
fix
the
proper
routes
of
ocean
telegraphs
further
surveys
of
the
great
isthmus
have
been
undertaken
and
completed
and
two
vessels
of
the
navy
are
now
employed
in
conjunction
with
those
of
england
france
germany
and
russia
in
observations
connected
with
the
transit
of
venus
so
useful
and
interesting
to
the
scientific
world
the
estimates
for
this
branch
of
the
public
service
do
not
differ
materially
from
those
of
last
year
those
for
the
general
support
of
the
service
being
somewhat
less
and
those
for
permanent
improvements
at
the
various
stations
rather
larger
than
the
corresponding
estimate
made
a
year
ago
the
regular
maintenance
and
a
steady
increase
in
the
efficiency
of
this
most
important
arm
in
proportion
to
the
growth
of
our
maritime
intercourse
and
interests
is
recommended
to
the
attention
of
congress
the
use
of
the
navy
in
time
of
peace
might
be
further
utilized
by
a
direct
authorization
of
the
employment
of
naval
vessels
in
explorations
and
surveys
of
the
supposed
navigable
waters
of
other
nationalities
on
this
continent
especially
the
tributaries
of
the
two
great
rivers
of
south
america
the
orinoco
and
the
amazon
nothing
prevents
under
existing
laws
such
exploration
except
that
expenditures
must
be
made
in
such
expeditions
beyond
those
usually
provided
for
in
the
appropriations
the
field
designated
is
unquestionably
one
of
interest
and
one
capable
of
large
development
of
commercial
interestsadvantageous

the

is
the
great
agent
of

our
vast
territory
the
rapidity
with
which
new
sections
are
being
settled
thus
increasing
the
carrying
of

in
a
more
rapid
ratio
than
the
increase
of
receipts
is
not
alarming
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
herewith
attached
shows
that
there
was
an
increase
of
revenue
in
his
department
in
over
the
previous
year

and
an
increase
of
cost

of
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
gives
interesting
statistics
of
his
department
and
compares
them
with
the
corresponding
statistics
of
a
year
ago
showing
a
growth
in
every
branch
of
the
department
a
postal
convention
has
been
concluded
with
new
south
wales
an
exchange
of
postal
cards
established
with
switzerland
and
the
negotiations
pending
for
several
years
past
with

have
been
terminated
in
a
convention
with
that
country
which
went
into
effect
last
august
an
international
postal
congress
was
convened
in
berne
switzerland
in
september
last
at
which
the
united
states
was
represented
by
an
officer
of
the
postoffice
department
of
much
experience
and
of
qualification
for
the
position
a
convention
for
the
establishment
of
an
international
postal
union
was
agreed
upon
and
signed
by
the
delegates
of
the
countries
represented
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
proper
authorities
of
those
countries
i
respectfully
direct
your
attention
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
and
to
his
suggestions
in
regard
to
an
equitable
adjustment
of
the
question
of
compensation
to
railroads
for
carrying
the
mails
your
attention
will
be
drawn
to
the
unsettled
condition
of
affairs
in
some
of
the
southern
states
on
the
th
of
september
last
the
governor
of
louisiana
called
upon
me
as
provided
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
to
aid
in
suppressing
domestic
violence
in
that
state
this
call
was
made
in
view
of
a
proclamation
issued
on
that
day
by
d
b
penn
claiming
that
he
was
elected
lieutenantgovernor
in
and
calling
upon
the
militia
of
the
state
to
arm
assemble
and
drive
from
power
the
usurpers
as
he
designated
the
officers
of
the
state
government
on
the
next
day
i
issued
my
proclamation
commanding
the
insurgents
to
disperse
within
five
days
from
the
date
thereof
and
subsequently
learned
that
on
that
day
they
had
taken
forcible
possession
of
the
statehouse
steps
were
taken
by
me
to
support
the
existing
and
recognized
state
government
but
before
the
expiration
of
the
five
days
the
insurrectionary
movement
was
practically
abandoned
and
the
officers
of
the
state
government
with
some
minor
exceptions
resumed
their
powers
and
duties
considering
that
the
present
state
administration
of
louisiana
has
been
the
only
government
in
that
state
for
nearly
two
years
that
it
has
been
tacitly
acknowledged
and
acquiesced
in
as
such
by
congress
and
more
than
once
expressly
recognized
by
me
i
regarded
it
as
my
clear
duty
when
legally
called
upon
for
that
purpose
to
prevent
its
overthrow
by
an
armed
mob
under
pretense
of
fraud
and
irregularity
in
the
election
of
i
have
heretofore
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
this
subject
stating
that
on
account
of
the
frauds
and
forgeries
committed
at
said
election
and
because
it
appears
that
the
returns
thereof
were
never
legally
canvassed
it
was
impossible
to
tell
thereby
who
were
chosen
but
from
the
best
sources
of
information
at
my
command
i
have
always
believed
that
the
present
state
officers
received
a
majority
of
the
legal
votes
actually
cast
at
that
election
i
repeat
what
i
said
in
my
special
message
of
february
that
in
the
event
of
no
action
by
congress
i
must
continue
to
recognize
the
government
heretofore
recognized
by
me
i
regret
to
say
that
with
preparations
for
the
late
election
decided
indications
appeared
in
some
localities
in
the
southern
states
of
a
determination
by
acts
of
violence
and
intimidation
to
deprive
citizens
of
the
freedom
of
the
ballot
because
of
their
political
opinions
bands
of
men
masked
and
armed
made
their
appearance
white
leagues
and
other
societies
were
formed
large
quantities
of
arms
and
ammunition
were
imported
and
distributed
to
these
organizations
military
drills
with
menacing
demonstrations
were
held
and
with
all
these
murders
enough
were
committed
to
spread
terror
among
those
whose
political
action
was
to
be
suppressed
if
possible
by
these
intolerant
and
criminal
proceedings
in
some
places
colored
laborers
were
compelled
to
vote
according
to
the
wishes
of
their
employers
under
threats
of
discharge
if
they
acted
otherwise
and
there
are
too
many
instances
in
which
when
these
threats
were
disregarded
they
were
remorselessly
executed
by
those
who
made
them
i
understand
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
was
made
to
prevent
this
and
a
like
state
of
things
and
the
act
of
may
with
amendments
was
passed
to
enforce
its
provisions
the
object
of
both
being
to
guarantee
to
all
citizens
the
right
to
vote
and
to
protect
them
in
the
free
enjoyment
of
that
right
enjoined
by
the
constitution
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
and
convinced
by
undoubted
evidence
that
violations
of
said
act
had
been
committed
and
that
a
widespread
and
flagrant
disregard
of
it
was
contemplated
the
proper
officers
were
instructed
to
prosecute
the
offenders
and
troops
were
stationed
at
convenient
points
to
aid
these
officers
if
necessary
in
the
performance
of
their
official

duties
complaints
are
made
of
this
interference
by
federal
authority
but
if
said
amendment
and
act
do
not
provide
for
such
interference
under
the
circumstances
as
above
stated
then
they
are
without
meaning
force
or
effect
and
the
whole
scheme
of
colored
enfranchisement
is
worse
than
mockery
and
little
better
than
a
crime
possibly
congress
may
find
it
due
to
truth
and
justice
to
ascertain
by
means
of
a
committee
whether
the
alleged
wrongs
to
colored
citizens
for
political
purposes
are
real
or
the
reports
thereof
were
manufactured
for
the
occasion

article
of

was
adopted

of

thereon
on

the

convened
an
extra
session
of
the

of

which
on
the
th
of
the

passed
an
act
providing
for
a

to
frame
a
new
constitution
pursuant
to
this
act
and
at
an
election
held
on

th
of

the
convention
was
approved
and
delegates
were
chosen
thereto
who
assembled
on
the
th
of
last
july
and
framed
a
new
constitution
the
schedule
of
which
provided
for
the
election
of
an
entire
new
set
of
state
officers
in
a
manner
contrary
to
the
then
existing
election
laws
of
the
state
on
the
th
of
october
this
constitution
as
therein
provided
was
submitted
to
the
people
for
their
approval
or
rejection
and
according
to
the
election
returns
was
approved
by
a
large
majority
of
those
qualified
to
vote
thereon
and
at
the
same
election
persons
were
chosen
to
fill
all
the
state
county
and
township
offices
the
governor
elected
in
for
the
term
of
four
years
turned
over
his
office
to
the
governor
chosen
under
the
new
constitution
whereupon
the
lieutenantgovernor
also
elected
in
for
a
term
of
four
years
claiming
to
act
as
governor
and
alleging
that
said
proceedings
by
which
the
new
constitution
was
made
and
a
new
set
of
officers
elected
were
unconstitutional
illegal
and
void
called
upon
me
as
provided
in
section
article
iv
of
the
constitution
to
protect
the
state
against
domestic
violence
as
congress
is
now
investigating
the
political
affairs
of
arkansas
i
have
declined
to
interfere
the
whole
subject
of
executive
interference
with
the
affairs
of
a
state
is
repugnant
to
public
opinion
to
the
feelings
of
those
who
from
their
official
capacity
must
be
used
in
such
interposition
and
to
him
or
those
who
must
direct
unless
most
clearly
on
the
side
of
law
such
interference
becomes
a
crime
with
the
law
to
support
it
it
is
condemned
without
a
heating
i
desire
therefore
that
all
necessity
for
executive
direction
in
local
affairs
may
become
unnecessary
and
obsolete
i
invite
the
attention
not
of
congress
but
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
the
causes
and
effects
of
these
unhappy
questions
is
there
not
a
disposition
on
one
side
to
magnify
wrongs
and
outrages
and
on
the
other
side
to
belittle
them
or
justify
them
if
public
opinion
could
be
directed
to
a
correct
survey
of
what
is
and
to
rebuking
wrong
and
aiding
the
proper
authorities
in
punishing
it
a
better
state
of
feeling
would
be
inculcated
and
the
sooner
we
would
have
that
peace
which
would
leave
the
states
free
indeed
to
regulate
their
own
domestic
affairs
i
believe
on
the
part
of
our
citizens
of
the
southern
statesthe
better
part
of
themthere
is
a
disposition
to
be
law
abiding
and
to
do
no
violence
either
to
individuals
or
to
the
laws
existing
but
do
they
do
right
in
ignoring
the
existence
of
violence
and
bloodshed
in
resistance
to
constituted
authority
i
sympathize
with
their
prostrate
condition
and
would
do
all
in
my
power
to
relieve
them
acknowledging
that
in
some
instances
they
have
had
most
trying
governments
to
live
under
and
very
oppressive
ones
in
the
way
of
taxation
for
nominal
improvements
not
giving
benefits
equal
to
the
hardships
imposed
but
can
they
proclaim
themselves
entirely
irresponsible
for
this
condition
they
can
not
violence
has
been
rampant
in
some
localities
and
has
either
been
justified
or
denied
by
those
who
could
have
prevented
it
the
theory
is
even
raised
that
there
is
to
be
no
further
interference
on
the
part
of
the
general
government
to
protect
citizens
within
a
state
where
the
state
authorities
fail
to
give
protection
this
is
a
great
mistake
while
i
remain
executive
all
the
laws
of
congress
and
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
including
the
recent
amendments
added
thereto
will
be
enforced
with
rigor
but
with
regret
that
they
should
have
added
one
jot
or
tittle
to
executive
duties
or
powers
let
there
be
fairness
in
the
discussion
of
southern
questions
the
advocates
of
both
or
all
political
parties
giving
honest
truthful
reports
of
occurrences
condemning
the
wrong
and
upholding
the
tight
and
soon
all
will
be
well
under
existing
conditions
the
negro
votes
the
republican
ticket
because
he
knows
his
friends
are
of
that
party
many
a
good
citizen
votes
the
opposite
not
because
he
agrees
with
the
great
principles
of
state
which
separate
parties
but
because
generally
he
is
opposed
to
negro
rule
this
is
a
most
delusive
cry
treat
the
negro
as
a
citizen
and
a
voter
as
he
is
and
must
remain
and
soon
parties
will
be
divided
not
on
the
color
line
but
on
principle
then
we
shall
have
no
complaint
of
sectional
interference
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
contains
valuable
recommendations
relating
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
which
i
invite
your
attention
i
respectfully
suggest
to
congress
the
propriety
of
increasing
the
number
of
judicial
districts
in
the
united
states
to
eleven
the
present
number
being
nine
and
the
creation
of
two
additional
judgeships
the
territory
to
be
traversed
by
the
circuit
judges
is
so
great
and
the
business
of
the
courts
so
steadily
increasing
that
it
is
growing
more
and
more
impossible
for
them
to
keep
up
with
the
business
requiring
their
attention
whether
this
would
involve
the
necessity
of
adding
two
more
justices
of
the
supreme
court
to
the
present
number
i
submit
to
the
judgment
of
congress
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
to
the
legislation
asked
for
by
him
the
domestic
interests
of
the
people
are
more
intimately
connected
with
this
department
than
with
either
of
the
other
departments
of
government
its
duties
have
been
added
to
from
time
to
time
until
they
have
become
so
onerous
that
without
the
most
perfect
system
and
order
it
will
be
impossible
for
any
secretary
of
the
interior
to
keep
trace
of
all
official
transactions
having
his
sanction
and
done
in
his
name
and
for
which
he
is
held
personally
responsible
the
policy
adopted
for
the
management
of
indian
affairs
known
as
the
peace
policy
has
been
adhered
to
with
most
beneficial
results
it
is
confidently
hoped
that
a
few
years
more
will
relieve
our
frontiers
from
danger
of
indian
depredations
i
commend
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
for
the
extension
of
the
homestead
laws
to
the
indians
and
for
some
sort
of
territorial
government
for
the
indian
territory
a
great
majority
of
the
indians
occupying
this
territory
are
believed
yet
to
be
incapable
of
maintaining
their
rights
against
the
more
civilized
and
enlightened
white
man
any
territorial
form
of
government
given
them
therefore
should
protect
them
in
their
homes
and
property
for
a
period
of
at
least
twenty
years
and
before
its
final
adoption
should
be
ratified
by
a
majority
of
those
affected
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
herewith
attached
gives
much
interesting
statistical
information
which
i
abstain
from
giving
an
abstract
of
but
refer
you
to
the
report
itself
the
act
of
congress
providing
the
oath
which
pensioners
must
subscribe
to
before
drawing
their
pensions
cuts
off
from
this
bounty
a
few
survivors
of
the
war
of
residing
in
the
southern
states
i
recommend
the
restoration
of
this
bounty
to
all
such
the
number
of
persons
whose
names
would
thus
be
restored
to
the
list
of
pensioners
is
not
large
they
are
all
old
persons
who
could
have
taken
no
part
in
the
rebellion
and
the
services
for
which
they
were
awarded
pensions
were
in
defense
of
the
whole
country
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
herewith
contains
suggestions
of
much
interest
to
the
general
public
and
refers
to
the
sly
approaching
centennial
and
the
part
his
department
is
ready
to
take
in
it
i
feel
that
the
nation
at
large
is
interested
in
having
this
exposition
a
success
and
commend
to
congress
such
action
as
will
secure
a
greater
general
interest
in
it
already
many
foreign
nations
have
signified
their
intention
to
be
represented
at
it
and
it
may
be
expected
that
every
civilized
nation
will
be
represented
the
rules
adopted
to
improve
the
civil
service
of
the
government
have
been
adhered
to
as
closely
as
has
been
practicable
with
the
opposition
with
which
they
meet
the
effect
i
believe
has
been
beneficial
on
the
whole
and
has
tended
to
the
elevation
of
the
service
but
it
is
impracticable
to
maintain
them
without
direct
and
positive
support
of
congress
generally
the
support
which
this
reform
receives
is
from
those
who
give
it
their
support
only
to
find
fault
when
the
rules
are
apparently
departed
from
removals
from
office
without
preferring
charges
against
parties
removed
are
frequently
cited
as
departures
from
the
rules
adopted
and
the
retention
of
those
against
whom
charges
are
made
by
irresponsible
persons
and
without
good
grounds
is
also
often
condemned
as
a
violation
of
them
under
these
circumstances

therefore
i
announce
that
if
congress
adjourns
without
positive
legislation
on
the
subject
of
civilservice
reform
i
will
regard
such
action
as
a
disapproval
of
the
system
and
will
abandon
it
except
so
far
as
to
require
examinations
for
certain
appointees
to
determine
their
fitness
competitive
examinations
will
be
abandoned
the
gentlemen
who
have
given
their
services
without
compensation
as
members
of
the
board
to
devise
rules
and
regulations
for
the
government
of
the
civil
service
of
the
country
have
shown
much
zeal
and
earnestness
in
their
work
and
to
them
as
well
as
to
myself
it
will
be
a
source
of
mortification
if
it
is
to
be
thrown
away
but
i
repeat
that
it
is
impossible
to
carry
this
system
to
a
successful
issue
without
general
approval
and
assistance
and
positive
law
to
support
it
i
have
stated
that
three
elements
of
prosperity
to
the
nationcapital
labor
skilled
and
unskilled
and
products
of
the
soilstill
remain
with
us
to
direct
the
employment
of
these
is
a
problem
deserving
the
most
serious
attention
of
congress
if
employment
can
be
given
to
all
the
labor
offering
itself
prosperity
necessarily
follows
i
have
expressed
the
opinion
and
repeat
it
that
the
first
requisite
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
end
is
the
substitution
of
a
sound
currency
in
place
of
one
of
a
fluctuating
value
this
secured
there
are
many
interests
that
might
be
fostered
to
the
great
profit
of
both
labor
and
capital
how
to
induce
capital
to
employ
labor
is
the
question
the
subject
of
cheap
transportation
has
occupied
the
attention
of
congress
much
new
light
on
this
question
will
without
doubt
be
given
by
the
committee
appointed
by
the
last
congress
to
investigate
and
report
upon
this
subject
a
revival
of
shipbuilding
and
particularly
of
iron
steamship
building
is
of
vast
importance
to
our
national
prosperity
the
united
states
is
now
paying
over
per
annum
for
freights
and
passage
on
foreign
shipsto
be
carried
abroad
and
expended
in
the
employment
and
support
of
other
peoplesbeyond
a
fair
percentage
of
what
should
go
to
foreign
vessels
estimating
on
the
tonnage
and
travel
of
each
respectively
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
this
disparity
in
the
carrying
trade
exists
and
to
correct
it
i
would
be
willing
to
see
a
great
departure
from
the
usual
course
of
government
in
supporting
what
might
usually
be
termed
private
enterprise
i
would
not
suggest
as
a
remedy
direct
subsidy
to
american
steamship
lines
but
i
would
suggest
the
direct
offer
of
ample
compensation
for
carrying
the
mails
between
atlantic
seaboard
cities
and
the
continent
on
americanowned
and
americanbuilt
steamers
and
would
extend
this
liberality
to
vessels
carrying
the
mails
to
south
american
states
and
to
central
america
and
mexico
and
would
pursue
the
same
policy
from
our
pacific
seaports
to
foreign
seaports
on
the
pacific
it
might
be
demanded
that
vessels
built
for
this
service
should
come
up
to
a
standard
fixed
by
legislation
in
tonnage
speed
and
all
other
qualities
looking
to
the
possibility
of
government
requiring
them
at
some
time
for
war
purposes
the
right
also
of
taking
possession
of
them
in
such
emergency
should
be
guarded
i
offer
these
suggestions
believing
them
worthy
of
consideration
in
all
seriousness
affecting
all
sections
and
all
interests
alike
if
anything
better
can
be
done
to
direct
the
country
into
a
course
of
general
prosperity
no
one
will
be
more
ready
than
i
to
second
the
plan
forwarded
herewith
will
be
found
the
report
of
the
commissioners
appointed
under
an
act
of
congress
approved
june
to
wind
up
the
affairs
of
the
district
government
it
will
be
seen
from
the
report
that
the

of
the

the
year
that
has
passed
since
the
submission
of
my
last
message
to
congress
has
especially
during
the
latter
part
of
it
been
an
eventful
one
to
the
country
in
the
midst
of
great
national
prosperity
a
financial
crisis
has
occurred
that
has
brought
low
fortunes
of
gigantic
proportions
political
partisanship
has
almost
ceased
to
exist
especially
in
the
agricultural
regions
and
finally
the
capture
upon
the
high
seas
of
a
vessel
bearing
our
flag
has
for
a
time
threatened
the
most
serious
consequences
and
has
agitated
the
public
mind
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
but
this
happily
now
is
in
the
course
of
satisfactory
adjustment
honorable
to
both
nations
concerned
the
relations
of
the
united
states
however
with
most
of
the
other
powers
continue
to
be
friendly
and
cordial
with
france
germany
russia
italy
and
the
minor
european
powers
with
brazil
and
most
of
the
south
american
republics
and
with
japan
nothing
has
occurred
during
the
year
to
demand
special
notice
the
correspondence
between
the
department
of
state
and
various
diplomatic
representatives
in
or
from
those
countries
is
transmitted
herewith
in
executing
the
will
of
congress
as
expressed
in
its
joint
resolution
of
the
th
of
february
last
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
resolution
a
number
of
practical
artisans
of
scientific
men
and
of
honorary
commissioners
were
authorized
to
attend
the
exposition
at
vienna
as
commissioners
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
it
is
believed
that
we
have
obtained
the
object
which
congress
had
in
view
when
it
passed
the
joint
resolutionin
order
to
enable
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
participate
in
the
advantages
of
the
international
exhibition
of
the
products
of
agriculture
manufactures
and
the
fine
arts
to
be
held
at
vienna
i
take
pleasure
in
adding
that
the
american
exhibitors
have
received
a
gratifying
number
of
diplomas
and
of
medals
during
the
exposition
a
conference
was
held
at
vienna
for
the
purpose
of
consultation
on
the
systems
prevailing
in
different
countries
for
the
protection
of
inventions
i
authorized
a
representative
from
the
patent
office
to
be
present
at
vienna
at
the
time
when
this
conference
was
to
take
place
in
order
to
aid
as
far
as
he
might
in
securing
any
possible
additional
protection
to
american
inventors
in
europe
the
report
of
this
agent
will
be
laid
before
congress
it
is
my
pleasant
duty
to
announce
to
congress
that
the
emperor
of
china
on
attaining
his
majority
received
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
western
powers
in
person
an
account
of
these
ceremonies
and
of
the
interesting
discussions
which
preceded
them
will
be
found
in
the
documents
transmitted
herewith
the
accompanying
papers
show
that
some
advance
although
slight
has
been
made
during
the
past
year
toward
the
suppression
of
the
infamous
chinese
cooly
trade
i
recommend
congress
to
inquire
whether
additional
legislation
be
not
needed
on
this
subject
the
money
awarded
to
the
united
states
by
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
at
geneva
was
paid
by
her
majestys
government
a
few
days
in
advance
of
the
time
when
it
would
have
become
payable
according
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
in
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
march
it
was
at
once
paid
into
the
treasury
and
used
to
redeem
so
far
as
it
might
the
public
debt
of
the
united
states
and
the
amount
so
redeemed
was
invested
in
a
per
cent
registered
bond
of
the
united
states
for
which
is
now
held
by
the
secretary
of
state
subject
to
the
future
disposition
of
congress
i
renew
my
recommendation
made
at
the
opening
of
the
last
session
of
congress
that
a
commission
be
created
for
the
purpose
of
auditing
and
determining
the
amounts
of
the
several
direct
losses
growing
out
of
the
destruction
of
vessels
and
their
cargoes
by
the
alabama
the
florida
or
the
shenandoah
after
leaving
melbourne
for
which
the
sufferers
have
received
no
equivalent
or
compensation
and
of
ascertaining
the
names
of
the
persons
entitled
to
receive
compensation
for
the
same
making
the
computations
upon
the
basis
indicated
by
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
at
geneva
and
that
payment
of
such
losses
be
authorized
to
an
extent
not
to
exceed
the
awards
of
the
tribunal
at
geneva
by
an
act
approved
on
the
th
day
of
february
last
congress
made
provision
for
completing
jointly
with
an
officer
or
commissioner
to
be
named
by
her
britannic
majesty
the
determination
of
so
much
of
the
boundary
line
between
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
the
possessions
of
great
britain
as
was
left
uncompleted
by
the
commissioners
appointed
under
the
act
of
congress
of
august
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
the
northwest
water
boundary
of
the
united
states
has
been
determined
and
marked
in
accordance
with
the
award
of
the
emperor
of
germany
a
protocol
and
a
copy
of
the
map
upon
which
the
line
was
thus
marked
are
contained
in
the
papers
submitted
herewith
i
also
transmit
a
copy
of
the
report
of
the
commissioner
for
marking
the
northern
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
possessions
west
of
the
lake
of
the
woods
of
the
operations
of
the
commission
during
the
past
season
surveys
have
been
made
to
a
point
miles
west
of
the
lake
of
the
woods
leaving
about
miles
to
be
surveyed
the
field
work
of
which
can
be
completed
during
the
next
season
the
mixed
commission
organized
under
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
washington
for
settling
and
determining
the
claims
of
citizens
of
either
power
against
the
other
arising
out
of
acts
committed
against
their
persons
or
property
during
the
period
between
april
and
april
made
its
final
award
on
the
th
day
of
september
last
it
was
awarded
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
pay
to
the
government
of
her
britannic
majesty
within
twelve
months
from
the
date
of
the
award
the
sum
of
in
gold
the
commission
disallowed
or
dismissed
all
other
claims
of
british
subjects
against
the
united
states
the
amount
of
the
claims
presented
by
the
british
government
but
disallowed
or
dismissed
is
understood
to
be
about
it
also
disallowed
all
the
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
great
britain
which
were
referred
to
it
i
recommend
the
early
passage
of
an
act
appropriating
the
amount
necessary
to
pay
this
award
against
the
united
states
i
have
caused
to
be
communicated
to
the
government
of
the
king
of
italy
the
thanks
of
this
government
for
the
eminent
services
rendered
by
count
corti
as
the
third
commissioner
on
this
commission
with
dignity
learning
and
impartiality
he
discharged
duties
requiring
great
labor
and
constant
patience
to
the
satisfaction
i
believe
of
both
governments
i
recommend
legislation
to
create
a
special
court
to
consist
of
three
judges
who
shall
be
empowered
to
hear
and
determine
all
claims
of
aliens
upon
the
united
states
arising
out
of
acts
committed
against
their
persons
or
property
during
the
insurrection
the
recent
reference
under
the
treaty
of
washington
was
confined
to
claims
of
british
subjects
arising
during
the
period
named
in
the
treaty
but
it
is
understood
that
there
are
other
british
claims
of
a
similar
nature
arising
after
the
th
of
april
and
it
is
known
that
other
claims
of
a
like
nature
are
advanced
by
citizens
or
subjects
of
other
powers
it
is
desirable
to
have
these
claims
also
examined
and
disposed
of
official
information
being
received
from
the
dutch
government
of
a
state
of
war
between
the
king
of
the
netherlands
and
the
sultan
of
acheen
the
officers
of
the
united
states
who
were
near
the
seat
of
the
war
were
instructed
to
observe
an
impartial
neutrality
it
is
believed
that
they
have
done
so
the
joint
commission
under
the
convention
with
mexico
of
having
again
been
legally
prolonged
has
resumed
its
business
which
it
is
hoped
may
be
brought
to
an
early
conclusion
the
distinguished
representative
of
her
britannic
majesty
at
washington
has
kindly
consented
with
the
approval
of
his
government
to
assume
the
arduous
and
responsible
duties
of
umpire
in
this
commission
and
to
lend
the
weight
of
his
character
and
name
to
such
decisions
as
may
not
receive
the
acquiescence
of
both
the
arbitrators
appointed
by
the
respective
governments
the
commissioners
appointed
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
congress
to
examine
into
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
forays
by
trespassers
from
that
country
upon
the
herds
of
texas
have
made
a
report
which
will
be
submitted
for
your
consideration
the
venezuelan
government
has
been
apprised
of
the
sense
of
congress
in
regard
to
the
awards
of
the
joint
commission
under
the
convention
of
th
april
as
expressed
in
the
act
of
the
th
of
february
last
it
is
apprehended
that
that
government
does
not
realize
the
character
of
its
obligations
under
that
convention
as
there
is
reason
to
believe
however
that
its
hesitancy
in
recognizing
them
springs
in
part
at
least
from
real
difficulty
in
discharging
them
in
connection
with
its
obligations
to
other
governments
the
expediency
of
further
forbearance
on
our
part
is
believed
to
be
worthy
of
your
consideration
the
ottoman
government
and
that
of
egypt
have
latterly
shown
a
disposition
to
relieve
foreign
consuls
of
the
judicial
powers
which
heretofore
they
have
exercised
in
the
turkish
dominions
by
organizing
other
tribunals
as
congress
however
has
by
law
provided
for
the
discharge
of
judicial
functions
by
consuls
of
the
united
states
in
that
quarter
under
the
treaty
of
i
have
not
felt
at
liberty
formally
to
accept
the
proposed
change
without
the
assent
of
congress
whose
decision
upon
the
subject
at
as
early
a
period
as
may
be
convenient
is
earnestly
requested
i
transmit
herewith
for
the
consideration
and
determination
of
congress
an
application
of
the
republic
of
santo
domingo
to
this
government
to
exercise
a
protectorate
over
that
republic
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
the
following
treaties
with
foreign
powers
have
been
proclaimed
a
naturalization
convention
with
denmark
a
convention
with
mexico
for
renewing
the
claims
commission
a
convention
of
friendship
commerce
and
extradition
with
the
orange
free
state
and
a
naturalization
convention
with
e
cuador
i
renew
the
recommendation
made
in
my
message
of
december
that
congress
authorize
the
postmastergeneral
to
issue
all
commissions
to
officials
appointed
through
his
department
i
invite
the
earnest
attention
of
congress
to
the
existing
laws
of
the
united
states
respecting
expatriation
and
the
election
of
nationality
by
individuals
many
citizens
of
the
united
states
reside
permanently
abroad
with
their
families
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
approved
february
the
children
of
such
persons
are
to
be
deemed
and
taken
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
but
the
rights
of
citizenship
are
not
to
descend
to
persons
whose
fathers
never
resided
in
the
united
states
it
thus
happens
that
persons
who
have
never
resided
within
the
united
states
have
been
enabled
to
put
forward
a
pretension
to
the
protection
of
the
united
states
against
the
claim
to
military
service
of
the
government
under
whose
protection
they
were
born
and
have
been
reared
in
some
cases
even
naturalized
citizens
of
the
united
states
have
returned
to
the
land
of
their
birth
with
intent
to
remain
there
and
their
children
the
issue
of
a
marriage
contracted
there
after
their
return
and
who
have
never
been
in
the
united
states
have
laid
claim
to
our
protection
when
the
lapse
of
many
years
had
imposed
upon
them
the
duty
of
military
service
to
the
only
government
which
had
ever
known
them
personally
until
the
year
it
was
left
embarrassed
by
conflicting
opinions
of
courts
and
of
jurists
to
determine
how
far
the
doctrine
of
perpetual
allegiance
derived
from
our
former
colonial
relations
with
great
britain
was
applicable
to
american
citizens
congress
then
wisely
swept
these
doubts
away
by
enacting
thatany
declaration
instruction
opinion
order
or
decision
of
any
officer
of
this
government
which
denies
restricts
impairs
or
questions
the
right
of
expatriation
is
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
this
government
but
congress
did
not
indicate
in
that
statute
nor
has
it
since
done
so
what
acts
are
to
be
deemed
to
work
expatriation
for
my
own
guidance
in
determining
such
questions
i
required
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
the
opinion
in
writing
of
the
principal
officer
in
each
of
the
executive
departments
upon
certain
questions
relating
to
this
subject
the
result
satisfies
me
that
further
legislation
has
become
necessary
i
therefore
commend
the
subject
to
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
and
i
transmit
herewith
copies
of
the
several
opinions
of
the
principal
officers
of
the
executive
departments
together
with
other
correspondence
and
pertinent
information
on
the
same
subject
the
united
states
who
led
the
way
in
the
overthrow
of
the
feudal
doctrine
of
perpetual
allegiance
are
among
the
last
to
indicate
how
their
own

may
elect
another
nationality
the
papers
submitted
herewith
indicate
what
is
necessary
to
place
us
on
a
par
with
other
leading
nations
in
liberality
of
legislation
on
this
international
question
we
have
already
in
our
treaties
assented
to
the
principles
which
would
need
to
be
embodied
in
laws
intended
to
accomplish
such
results
we
have
agreed
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
may
cease
to
be
citizens
and
may
voluntarily
render
allegiance
to
other
powers
we
have
agreed
that
residence
in
a
foreign
land
without
intent
to
return
shall
of
itself
work
expatriation
we
have
agreed
in
some
instances
upon
the
length
of
time
necessary
for
such
continued
residence
to
work
a
presumption
of
such
intent
i
invite
congress
now
to
mark
out
and
define
when
and
how
expatriation
can
be
accomplished
to
regulate
by
law
the
condition
of
american
women
marrying
foreigners
to
fix
the
status
of
children
born
in
a
foreign
country
of
american
parents
residing
more
or
less
permanently
abroad
and
to
make
rules
for
determining
such
other
kindred
points
as
may
seem
best
to
congress
in
compliance
with
the
request
of
congress
i
transmitted
to
the
american
minister
at
madrid
with
instructions
to
present
it
to
the
spanish
government
the
joint
resolution
approved
on
the
d
of
march
last
tendering
to
the
people
of
spain
in
the
name
and
on
the
behalf
of
the
american
people
the
congratulations
of
congress
upon
the
efforts
to
consolidate
in
spain
the
principles
of
universal
liberty
in
a
republican
form
of
government
the
existence
of
this
new
republic
was
inaugurated
by
striking
the
fetters
from
the
slaves
in
porto
rico
this
beneficent
measure
was
followed
by
the
release
of
several
thousand
persons
illegally
held
as
slaves
in
cuba
next
the
captaingeneral
of
that
colony
was
deprived
of
the
power
to
set
aside
the
orders
of
his
superiors
at
madrid
which
had
pertained
to
the
office
since
the
sequestered
estates
of
american
citizens
which
had
been
the
cause
of
long
and
fruitless
correspondence
were
ordered
to
be
restored
to
their
owners
all
these
liberal
steps
were
taken
in
the
face
of
a
violent
opposition
directed
by
the
reactionary
slaveholders
of
havana
who
are
vainly
striving
to
stay
the
march
of
ideas
which
has
terminated
slavery
in
christendom
cuba
only
excepted
unhappily
however
this
baneful
influence
has
thus
far
succeeded
in
defeating
the
efforts
of
all
liberalminded
men
in
spain
to
abolish
slavery
in
cuba
and
in
preventing
the
promised
reform
in
that
island
the
struggle
for
political
supremacy
continues
there
the
proslavery
and
aristocratic
party
in
cuba
is
gradually
arraigning
itself
in
more
and
more
open
hostility
and
defiance
of
the
home
government
while
it
still
maintains
a
political
connection
with
the
republic
in
the
peninsula
and
although
usurping
and
defying
the
authority
of
the
home
government
whenever
such
usurpation
or
defiance
tends
in
the
direction
of
oppression
or
of
the
maintenance
of
abuses
it
is
still
a
power
in
madrid
and
is
recognized
by
the
government
thus
an
element
more
dangerous
to
continued
colonial
relations
between
cuba
and
spain
than
that
which
inspired
the
insurrection
at
yaraan
element
opposed
to
granting
any
relief
from
misrule
and
abuse
with
no
aspirations
after
freedom

no
sympathies

breasts
aiming
to
rivet
still
stronger
the
shackles
of
slavery
and
oppressionhas
seized
many
of
the
emblems
of
power
in
cuba
and
under
professions
of
loyalty
to
the
mother
country
is
exhausting
the
resources
of
the
island
and
is
doing
acts
which
are
at
variance
with
those
principles
of
justice
of
liberality
and
of
right
which
give
nobility
of
character
to
a
republic
in
the
interests
of
humanity
of
civilization
and
of
progress
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
evil
influence
may
be
soon
averted
the

was
carried
into

where
fiftythree
of

were
inhumanly

so
far
at
least
as
relates
to
those
who
were
citizens
of
the
united

without
due
process
of
law
put
to
death
it
is
a
wellestablished
principle
asserted
by
the
united

from
the
beginning
of
their
national
independence
recognized
by
great
britain
and
other
maritime
powers

stated

detention
of
such

by

by

the
punishment
of
the

who
had
been
guilty
of

demanded
the
spanish

has
recognized
the
justice
of
the
demand
and
has
arranged
for
the
immediate
delivery
of
the

and
for
the
surrender

with
the
legation
of

was
conducted
in

by

and
needs
the
verification
of
the
actual
text
of
the
correspondence
it
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
due
to
the
importance
of
the
case
not
to
submit
this
correspondence
until
the
accurate
text
can
be

by

it
is

shortly
and
will
be

when
received
in
taking
leave
of
this
subject
for
the
present
i
wish
to
renew
the
expression
of
my
conviction
that
the
existence
of
african
slavery
in
cuba
is
a
principal
cause
of
the
lamentable
condition
of
the
island
i
do
not
doubt
that
congress
shares
with
me
the
hope
that
it
will
soon
be
made
to
disappear
and
that
peace
and
prosperity
may
follow
its
abolition
the
embargoing
of
american
estates
in

cruelty
to
american
citizens
detected
in
no
act
of
hostility
to
the
spanish
government
the
murdering
of
prisoners
taken
with
arms
in
their
hands
and
finally
the
capture
upon
the
high
seas
of
a
vessel
sailing
under
the
united
states
flag
and
bearing
a
united
states
registry
have
culminated
in
an
outburst
of
indignation
that
has
seemed
for
a
time
to
threaten
war
pending
negotiations
between
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
spain
on
the
subject
of
this
capture
i
have
authorized
the
secret
ary
of
the
navy
to
put
our
navy
on
a
war
footing
to
the
extent
at
least
of
the
entire
annual
appropriation
for
that
branch
of
the
service
trusting
to
congress
and
the
public
opinion
of
the
american
people
to
justify
my
action
assuming
from
the
action
of
the
last
congress
in
appointing
a
committee
on
privileges
and
elections
to
prepare
and
report
to
this
congress
a
constitutional
amendment
to
provide
a
better
method
of
electing
the
president
and
vicepresident
of
the
united
states
and
also
from
the
necessity
of
such
an
amendment
that
there
will
be
submitted
to
the
state
legislatures
for
ratification
such
an
improvement
in
our
constitution
i
suggest
two
others
for
your
consideration
first
to
authorize
the
executive
to
approve
of
so
much
of
any
measure
passing
the
two
houses
of
congress
as
his
judgment
may
dictate
without
approving
the
whole
the
disapproved
portion
or
portions
to
be
subjected
to
the
same
rules
as
now
to
wit
to
be
referred
back
to
the
house
in
which
the
measure
or
measures
originated
and
if
passed
by
a
twothirds
vote
of
the
two
houses
then
to
become
a
law
without
the
approval
of
the
president
i
would
add
to
this
a
provision
that
there
should
be
no
legislation
by
congress
during
the
last
twentyfour
hours
of
its
sitting
except
upon
vetoes
in
order
to
give
the
executive
an
opportunity
to
examine
and
approve
or
disapprove
bills
understandingly
second
to
provide
by
amendment
that
when
an
extra
session
of
congress
is
convened
by
executive
proclamation
legislation
during
the
continuance
of
such
extra
session
shall
be
confined
to
such
subjects
as
the
executive
may
bring
before
it
from
time
to
time
in
writing
the
advantages
to
be
gained
by
these
two
amendments
are
too
obvious
for
me
to
comment
upon
them
one
session
in
each
year
is
provided
for
by
the
constitution
in
which
there
are
no
restrictions
as
to
the
subjects
of
legislation
by
congress
if
more
are
required
it
is
always
in
the
power
of
congress
during
their
term
of
office
to
provide
for
sessions
at
any
time
the
first
of
these
amendments
would
protect
the
public
against
the
many
abuses
and
waste
of
public
moneys
which
creep
into
appropriation
bills
and
other
important
measures
passing
during
the
expiring
hours
of
congress
to
which
otherwise
due
consideration
can
not
be
given
treasury
department
the
receipts
of
the
government
from
all
sources
for
the
last
fiscal
year
were
and
expenditures
on
all
accounts
thus
showing
an
excess
of
receipts
over
expenditures
of
but
it
is
not
probable
that
this
favorable
exhibit
will
be
shown
for
the
present
fiscal
year
indeed
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
except
with
great
economy
on
the
part
of
congress
in
making
appropriations
and
the
same
economy
in
administering
the
various
departments
of
government
the
revenues
will
not
fall
short
of
meeting
actual
expenses
including
interest
on
the
public
debt
i
commend
to
congress
such
economy
and
point
out
two
sources
where
it
seems
to
me
it
might
commence
to
wit
in
the
appropriations
for
public
buildings
in
the
many
cities
where
work
has
not
yet
been
commenced
in
the
appropriations
for
river
and
harbor
improvement
in
those
localities
where
the
improvements
are
of
but
little
benefit
to
general
commerce
and
for
fortifications
there
is
a
still
more
fruitful
source
of
expenditure
which
i
will
point
out
later
in
this
message
i
refer
to
the
easy
method
of
manufacturing
claims
for
losses
incurred
in
suppressing
the
late
rebellion
i
would
not
be
understood
here
as
opposing
the
erection
of
good
substantial
and
even
ornamental
buildings
by
the
government
wherever
such
buildings
are
needed
in
fact
i
approve
of
the
government
owning
its
own
buildings
in
all
sections
of
the
country
and
hope
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
it
will
not
only
possess
them
but
will
erect
in
the
capital
suitable
residences
for
all
persons
who
now
receive
commutation
for
quarters
or
rent
at
government
expense
and
for
the
cabinet
thus
setting
an
example
to
the
states
which
may
induce
them
to
erect
buildings
for
their
senators
but
i
would
have
this
work
conducted
at
a
time
when
the
revenues
of
the
country
would
abundantly
justify
it
the
revenues
have
materially
fallen
off
for
the
first
five
months
of
the
present
fiscal
year
from
what
they
were
expected
to
produce
owing
to
the
general
panic
now
prevailing
which
commenced
about
the
middle
of
september
last
the
full
effect
of
this
disaster
if
it
should
not
prove
a
blessing
in
disguise
is
yet
to
be
demonstrated
in
either
event
it
is
your
duty
to
heed
the
lesson
and
to
provide
by
wise
and
wellconsidered
legislation
as
far
as
it
lies
in
your
power
against
its
recurrence
and
to
take
advantage
of
all
benefits
that
may
have
accrued
my
own
judgment
is
that
however
much
individuals
may
have
suffered
one
long
step
has
been
taken
toward
specie
payments
that
we
can
never
have
permanent
prosperity
until
a
specie
basis
is
reached
and
that
a
specie
basis
can
not
be
reached
and
maintained
until
our
exports
exclusive
of
gold
pay
for
our
imports
interest
due
abroad
and
other
specie
obligations
or
so
nearly
so
as
to
leave
an
appreciable
accumulation
of
the
precious
metals
in
the
country
from
the
products
of
our
mines
the
development
of
the
mines
of
precious
metals
during
the
past
year
and
the
prospective
development
of
them
for
years
to
come
are
gratifying
in
their
results
could
but
onehalf
of
the
gold
extracted
from
the
mines
be
retained
at
home
our
advance
toward
specie
payments
would
be
rapid
to
increase
our
exports
sufficient
currency
is
required
to
keep
all
the
industries
of
the
country
employed
without
this
national
as
well
as
individual
bankruptcy
must
ensue
undue
inflation
on
the
other
hand
while
it
might
give
temporary
relief
would
only
lead
to
inflation
of
prices
the
impossibility
of
competing
in
our
own
markets
for
the
products
of
home
skill
and
labor
and
repeated
renewals
of
present
experiences
elasticity
to
our
circulating
medium
therefore
and
just
enough
of
it
to
transact
the
legitimate
business
of
the
country
and
to
keep
all
industries
employed
is
what
is
most
to
be
desired
the
exact
medium
is
specie
the
recognized
medium
of
exchange
the
world
over
that
obtained
we
shall
have
a
currency
of
an
exact
degree
of
elasticity
if
there
be
too
much
of
it
for
the
legitimate
purposes
of
trade
and
commerce
it
will
flow
out
of
the
country
if
too
little
the
reverse
will
result
to
hold
what
we
have
and
to
appreciate
our
currency
to
that
standard
is
the
problem
deserving
of
the
most
serious
consideration
of
congress
the
experience
of
the
present
panic
has
proven
that
the
currency
of
the
country
based
as
it
is
upon
the
credit
of
the
country
is
the
best
that
has
ever
been
devised
usually
in
times
of
such
trials
currency
has
become
worthless
or
so
much
depreciated
in
value
as
to
inflate
the
values
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
as
compared
with
the
currency
everyone
holding
it
has
been
anxious
to
dispose
of
it
on
any
terms
now
we
witness
the
reverse
holders
of
currency
hoard
it
as
they
did
gold
in
former
experiences
of
a
like
nature
it
is
patent
to
the
most
casual
observer
that
much
more
currency
or
money
is
required
to
transact
the
legitimate
trade
of
the
country
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
when
the
vast
crops
are
being
removed
than
during
the
balance
of
the
year
with
our
present
system
the
amount
in
the
country
remains
the
same
throughout
the
entire
year
resulting
in
an
accumulation
of
all
the
surplus
capital
of
the
country
in
a
few
centers
when
not
employed
in
the
moving
of
crops
tempted
there
by
the
offer
of
interest
on
call
loans
interest
being
paid
this
surplus
capital
must
earn
this
interest
paid
with
a
profit
being
subject
to
call
it
can
not
be
loaned
only
in
part
at
best
to
the
merchant
or
manufacturer
for
a
fixed
term
hence
no
matter
how
much
currency
there
might
be
in
the
country
it
would
be
absorbed
prices
keeping
pace
with
the
volume
and
panics
stringency
and
disasters
would
ever
be
recurring
with
the
autumn
elasticity
in
our
monetary
system
therefore
is
the
object
to
be
attained
first
and
next
to
that
as
far
as
possible
a
prevention
of
the
use
of
other
peoples
money
in
stock
and
other
species
of
speculation
to
prevent
the
latter
it
seems
to
me
that
one
great
step
would
be
taken
by
prohibiting
the
national
banks
from
paying
interest
on
deposits
by
requiring
them
to
hold
their
reserves
in
their
own
vaults
and
by
forcing
them
into
resumption
though
it
would
only
be
in
legaltender
notes
for
this
purpose
i
would
suggest
the
establishment
of
clearing
houses
for
your
consideration
to
secure
the
former
many
plans
have
been
suggested
most
if
not
all
of
which
look
to
me
more
like
inflation
on
the
one
hand
or
compelling
the
government
on
the
other
to
pay
interest
without
corresponding
benefits
upon
the
surplus
funds
of
the
country
during
the
seasons
when
otherwise
unemployed
i
submit
for
your
consideration
whether
this
difficulty
might
not
be
overcome
by
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
issue
at
any
time
to
national
banks
of
issue
any
amount
of
their
own
notes
below
a
fixed
percentage
of
their
issue
say
per
cent
upon
the
banks
depositing
with
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
an
amount
of
government
bonds
equal
to
the
amount
of
notes
demanded
the
banks
to
forfeit
to
the
government
say
per
cent
of
the
interest
accruing
on
the
bonds
so
pledged
during
the
time
they
remain
with
the
treasurer
as
security
for
the
increased
circulation
the
bonds
so
pledged
to
be
redeemable
by
the
banks
at
their
pleasure
either
in
whole
or
in
part
by
returning
their
own
bills
for
cancellation
to
an
amount
equal
to
the
face
of
the
bonds
withdrawn
i
would
further
suggest
for
your
consideration
the
propriety
of
authorizing
national
banks
to
diminish
their
standing
issue
at
pleasure
by
returning
for
cancellation
their
own
bills
and
withdrawing
so
many
united
states
bonds
as
are
pledged
for
the
bills
returned
in
view
of
the
great
actual
contraction
that
has
taken
place
in
the
currency
and
the
comparative
contraction
continuously
going
on
due
to
the
increase
of
population
increase
of
manufactories
and

all
the
industries
i
do
not
believe
there
is
too
much
of
it
now
for
the
dullest
period
of
the
year
indeed
if
clearing
houses
should
be
established
thus
forcing
redemption
it
is
a
question
for
your
consideration
whether
banking
should
not
be
made
free
retaining
all
the
safeguards
now
required
to
secure
bill
holders
in
any
modification
of
the
present
laws
regulating
national
banks
as
a
further
step
toward
preparing
for
resumption
of
specie
payments
i
invite
your
attention
to
a
consideration
of
the
propriety
of
exacting
from
them
the
retention
as
a
part
of
their
reserve
either
the
whole
or
a
part
of
the
gold
interest
accruing
upon
the
bonds
pledged
as
security
for
their
issue
i
have
not
reflected
enough
on
the
bearing
this
might
have
in
producing
a
scarcity
of
coin
with
which
to
pay
duties
on
imports
to
give
it
my
positive
recommendation
but
your
attention
is
invited
to
the
subject
during
the
last
four
years
the
currency
has
been
contracted
directly
by
the
withdrawal
of
per
cent
certificates
compoundinterest
notes
and
seventhirty
bonds
outstanding
on
the
th
of
march
all
of
which
took
the
place
of
legaltenders
in
the
bank
reserves
to
the
extent
of
during
the
same
period
there
has
been
a
much
larger
comparative
contraction
of
the
currency
the
population
of
the
country
has
largely
increased
more
than
miles
of
railroad
have
been
built
requiring
the
active
use
of
capital
to
operate
them
millions
of
acres
of
land
have
been
opened
to
cultivation
requiring
capital
to
move
the
products
manufactories
have
multiplied
beyond
all
precedent
in
the
same
period
of
time
requiring
capital
weekly
for
the
payment
of
wages
and
for
the
purchase
of
material
and
probably
the
largest
of
all
comparative
contraction
arises
from
the
organizing
of
free
labor
in
the
south
now
every
laborer
there
receives
his
wages
and
for
want
of
savings
banks
the
greater
part
of
such
wages
is
carried
in
the
pocket
or
hoarded
until
required
for
use
these
suggestions
are
thrown
out
for
your
consideration
without
any
recommendation
that
they
shall
be
adopted
literally
but
hoping
that
the
best
method
may
be
arrived
at
to
secure
such
an
elasticity
of
the
currency
as
will
keep
employed
all
the
industries
of
the
country
and
prevent
such
an
inflation
as
will
put
off
indefinitely
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
an
object
so
devoutly
to
be
wished
for
by
all
and
by
none
more
earnestly
than
the
class
of
people
most
directly
interestedthose
who
earn
their
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
the
decisions
of
congress
on
this
subject
will
have
the
hearty
support
of
the
executive
in
previous
messages
i
have
called
attention
to
the
decline
in
american
shipbuilding
and
recommended
such
legislation
as
would
secure
to
us
our
proportion
of
the
carrying
trade
stimulated
by
high
rates
and
abundance
of
freight
the
progress
for
the
last
year
in
shipbuilding
has
been
very
satisfactory
there
has
been
an
increase
of
about
per
cent
in
the
amount
transported
in
american
vessels
over
the
amount
of
last
year
with
the
reduced
cost
of
material
which
has
taken
place
it
may
reasonably
be
hoped
that
this
progress
will
be
maintained
and
even
increased
however
as
we
pay
about
per
annum
to
foreign
vessels
for
the
transportation
to
a
market
of
our
surplus
products
thus
increasing
the
balance
of
trade
against
us
to
this
amount
the
subject
is
one
worthy
of
your
serious
consideration
cheap
transportation
is
a
subject
that
has
attracted
the
attention
of
both
producers
and
consumers
for
the
past
few
years
and
has
contributed
to
if
it
has
not
been
the
direct
cause
of
the
recent
panic
and
stringency
as
congress
at
its
last
session
appointed
a
special
committee
to
investigate
this
whole
subject
during
the
vacation
and
report
at
this
session
i
have
nothing
to
recommend
until
their
report
is
read
there
is
one
work
however
of
a
national
character
in
which
the
greater
portion
of
the
east
and
the
west
the
north
and
the
south
are
equally
interested
to
which
i
will
invite
your
attention
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
canal
connecting
lake
erie
with
tide
water
on
the
hudson
river
the
state
of
illinois
has
a
similar
work
connecting
lake
michigan
with
navigable
water
on
the
illinois
river
thus
making
water
communication
inland
between
the
east
and
the
west
and
south
these
great
artificial
water
courses
are
the
property
of
the
states
through
which
they
pass
and
pay
toll
to
those
states
would
it
not
be
wise
statesmanship
to
pledge
these
states
that
if
they
will
open
these
canals
for
the
passage
of
large
vessels
the
general
government
will
look
after
and
keep
in
navigable
condition
the
great
public
highways
with
which
they
connect
to
wit
the
overslaugh
on
the
hudson
the
st
clair
flats
and
the
illinois
and
mississippi
rivers
this
would
be
a
national
work
one
of
great
value
to
the
producers
of
the
west
and
south
in
giving
them
cheap
transportation
for
their
produce
to
the
seaboard
and
a
market
and
to
the
consumers
in
the
east
in
giving
them
cheaper
food
particularly
of
those
articles
of
food
which
do
not
find
a
foreign
market
and
the
prices
of
which
therefore
are
not
regulated
by
foreign
demands
the
advantages
of
such
a
work
are
too
obvious
for
argument
i
submit
the
subject
to
you
therefore
without
further
comment
in
attempting
to
regain
our
lost
commerce
and
carrying
trade
i
have
heretofore
called
attention
to
the
states
south
of
us
offering
a
field
where
much
might
be
accomplished
to
further
this
object
i
suggest
that
a
small
appropriation
be
made
accompanied
with
authority
for
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
fit
out
a
naval
vessel
to
ascend
the
amazon
river
to
the
mouth
of
the
madeira
thence
to
explore
that
river
and
its
tributaries
into
bolivia
and
to
report
to
congress
at
its
next
session
or
as
soon
as
practicable
the
accessibility
of
the
country
by
water
its
resources
and
the
population
so
reached
such
an
exploration
would
cost
but
little
it
can
do
no
harm
and
may
result
in
establishing
a
trade
of
value
to
both
nations
in
further
connection
with
the
treasury
department
i
would
recommend
a
revision
and
codification
of
the
tariff
laws
and
the
opening
of
more
mints
for
coining
money
with
authority
to
coin
for
such
nations
as
may
apply
war
department
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
to
the
recommendations
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
herewith
accompanying
the
apparent
great
cost
of
supporting
the
army
is
fully
explained
by
this
report
and
i
hope
will
receive
your
attention
while
inviting
your
general
attention
to
all
the
recommendations
made
by
the
secretary
of
war
there
are
two
which
i
would
especially
invite
you
to
consider
first
the
importance
of
preparing
for
war
in
time
of
peace
by
providing
proper
armament
for
our
seacoast
defenses
proper
armament
is
of
vastly
more
importance
than
fortifications
the
latter
can
be
supplied
very
speedily
for
temporary
purposes
when
needed
the
former
can
not
the
second
is
the
necessity
of
reopening
promotion
in
the
staff
corps
of
the
army
particularly
is
this
necessity
felt
in
the
medical
pay
and
ordnance
departments
at
this
time
it
is
necessary
to
employ
contract
surgeons
to
supply
the
necessary
medical
attendance
required
by
the
army
with
the
present
force
of
the
pay
department
it
is
now
difficult
to
make
the
payments
to
troops
provided
for
by
law
long
delays
in
payments
are
productive
of
desertions
and
other
demoralization
and
the
law
prohibits
the
payment
of
troops
by
other
than
regular
army
paymasters
there
are
now
sixteen
vacancies
in
the
ordnance
department
thus
leaving
that
branch
of
the
service
without
sufficient
officers
to
conduct
the
business
of
the
different
arsenals
on
a
large
scale
if
ever
required
navy
department
during
the
past
year
our
navy
has
been
depleted
by
the
sale
of
some
vessels
no
longer
fit
for
naval
service
and
by
the
condemnation
of
others
not
yet
disposed
of
this
however
has
been
more
than
compensated
for
by
the
repair
of
six
of
the
old
wooden
ships
and
by
the
building
of
eight
new
sloops
of
war
authorized
by
the
last
congress
the
building
of
these
latter
has
occurred
at
a
doubly
fortunate
time
they
are
about
being
completed
at
a
time
when
they
may
possibly
be
much
needed
and
the
work
upon
them
has
not
only
given
direct
employment
to
thousands
of
men
but
has
no
doubt
been
the
means
of
keeping
open
establishments
for
other
work
at
a
time
of
great
financial
distress
since
the
commencement
of
the
last
month
however
the
distressing
occurrences
which
have
taken
place
in
the
waters
of
the
caribbean
sea
almost
on
our
very
seaboard
while
they
illustrate
most
forcibly
the
necessity
always
existing
that
a
nation
situated
like
ours
should
maintain
in
a
state
of
possible
efficiency
a
navy
adequate
to
its
responsibilities
has
at
the
same
time
demanded
that
all
the
effective
force
we
really
have
shall
be
put
in
immediate
readiness
for
warlike
service
this
has
been
and
is
being
done
promptly
and
effectively
and
i
am
assured
that
all
the
available
ships
and
every
authorized
man
of
the
american
navy
will
be
ready
for
whatever
action
is
required
for
the
safety
of
our
citizens
or
the
maintenance
of
our
honor
this
of
course
will
require
the
expenditure
in
a
short
time
of
some
of
the
appropriations
which
were
calculated
to
extend
through
the
fiscal
year
but
congress
will
i
doubt
not
understand
and
appreciate
the
emergency
and
will
provide
adequately
not
only
for
the
present
preparation
but
for
the
future
maintenance
of
our
naval
force
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
during
the
past
year
been
quietly
putting
some
of
our
most
effective
monitors
in
condition
for
service
and
thus
the
exigency
finds
us
in
a
much
better
condition
for
work
than
we
could
possibly
have
been
without
his
action

adduced

require
your
early
and
special
attention
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
case
of
clinton
vs
englebrecht
decided
that
the
united
states
marshal
of
that
territory
could
not
lawfully
summon
jurors
for
the
district
courts
and
those
courts
hold
that
the
territorial
marshal
can
not
lawfully
perform
that
duty
because
he
is
elected
by
the
legislative
assembly
and
not
appointed
as
provided
for
in
the
act
organizing
the
territory
all
proceedings
at
law
are
practically
abolished
by
these
decisions
and
there
have
been
but
few
or
no
jury
trials
in
the
district
courts
of
that
territory
since
the
last
session
of
congress
property
is
left
without
protection
by
the
courts
and
crimes
go
unpunished
to
prevent
anarchy
there
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
congress
provide
the
courts
with
some
mode
of
obtaining
jurors
and
i
recommend
legislation
to
that
end
and
also
that
the
probate
courts
of
the
territory
now
assuming
to
issue
writs
of
injunction
and
habeas
corpus
and
to
try
criminal
cases
and
questions
as
to
land
titles
be
denied
all
jurisdiction
not
possessed
ordinarily
by
courts
of
that
description
i
have
become
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
act
approved
march
entitled
an
act
to
establish
a
uniform
system
of
bankruptcy
throughout
the
united
states
is
productive
of
more
evil
than
good
at
this
time
many
considerations
might
be
urged
for
its
total
repeal
but
if
this
is
not
considered
advisable
i
think
it
will
not
be
seriously
questioned
that
those
portions
of
said
act
providing
for
what
is
called
involuntary
bankruptcy
operate
to
increase
the
financial
embarrassments
of
the
country
careful
and
prudent
men
very
often
become
involved
in
debt
in
the
transaction
of
their
business
and
though
they
may
possess
ample
property
if
it
could
be
made
available
for
that
purpose
to
meet
all
their
liabilities
yet
on
account
of
the
extraordinary
scarcity
of
money
they
may
be
unable
to
meet
all
their
pecuniary
obligations
as
they
become
due
in
consequence
of
which
they
are
liable
to
be
prostrated
in
their
business
by
proceedings
in
bankruptcy
at
the
instance
of
unrelenting
creditors
people
are
now
so
easily
alarmed
as
to
monetary
matters
that
the
mere
filing
of
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
by
an
unfriendly
creditor
will
necessarily
embarrass
and
oftentimes
accomplish
the
financial
ruin
of
a
responsible
business
man
those
who
otherwise
might
make
lawful
and
just
arrangements
to
relieve
themselves
from
difficulties
produced
by
the
present
stringency
in
money
are
prevented
by
their
constant
exposure
to
attack
and
disappointment
by
proceedings
against
them
in
bankruptcy
and
besides
the
law
is
made
use
of
in
many
cases
by
obdurate
creditors
to
frighten
or
force
debtors
into
a
compliance
with
their
wishes
and
into
acts
of
injustice
to
other
creditors
and
to
themselves
i
recommend
that
so
much
of
said
act
as
provides
for
involuntary
bankruptcy
on
account
of
the
suspension
of
payment
be
repealed
your
careful
attention
is
invited
to
the
subject
of
claims
against
the
government
and
to
the
facilities
afforded
by
existing
laws
for
their
prosecution
each
of
the
departments
of
state
treasury
and
war
has
demands
for
many
millions
of
dollars
upon
its
files
and
they
are
rapidly
accumulating
to
these
may
be
added
those
now
pending
before
congress
the
court
of
claims
and
the
southern
claims
commission
making
in
the
aggregate
an
immense
sum
most
of
these
grow
out
of
the
rebellion
and
are
intended
to
indemnify
persons
on
both
sides
for
their
losses
during
the
war
and
not
a
few
of
them
are
fabricated
and
supported
by
false
testimony
projects
are
on
foot
it
is
believed
to
induce
congress
to
provide
for
new
classes
of
claims
and
to
revive
old
ones
through
the
repeal
or
modification
of
the
statute
of
limitations
by
which
they
are
now
barred
i
presume
these
schemes
if
proposed
will
be
received
with
little
favor
by
congress
and
i
recommend
that
persons
having
claims
against
the
united
states
cognizable
by
any
tribunal
or
department
thereof
be
required
to
present
them
at
an
early
day
and
that
legislation
be
directed
as
far
as
practicable
to
the
defeat
of
unfounded
and
unjust
demands
upon
the
government
and
i
would
suggest
as
a
means
of
preventing
fraud
that
witnesses
be
called
upon
to
appear
in
person
to
testify
before
those
tribunals
having
said
claims
before
them
for
adjudication
probably
the
largest
saving
to
the
national
treasury
can
be
secured
by
timely
legislation
on
these
subjects
of
any
of
the
economic
measures
that
will
be
proposed
you
will
be
advised
of
the
operations
of
the
department
of
justice
by
the
report
of
the
attorneygeneral
and
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
amendments
of
existing
laws
suggested
by
him
with
the
view
of
reducing
the
expenses
of
that
department
department
of
the
interior
the
policy
inaugurated
toward
the
indians
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
administration
has
been
steadily
pursued
and
i
believe
with
beneficial
results
it
will
be
continued
with
only
such
modifications
as
time
and
experience
may
demonstrate
as
necessary
with
the
encroachment
of
civilization
upon
the
indian
reservations
and
hunting
grounds
disturbances
have
taken
place
between
the
indians
and
whites
during
the
past
year
and
probably
will
continue
to
do
so
until
each
race
appreciates
that
the
other
has
rights
which
must
be
respected
the
policy
has
been
to
collect
the
indians
as
rapidly
as
possible
on
reservations
and
as
far
as
practicable
within
what
is
known
as
the
indian
territory
and
to
teach
them
the
arts
of
civilization
and
selfsupport
where
found
off
their
reservations
and
endangering
the
peace
and
safety
of
the
whites
they
have
been
punished
and
will
continue
to
be
for
like
offenses
the
indian
territory
south
of
kansas
and
west
of
arkansas
is
sufficient
in
area
and
agricultural
resources
to
support
all
the
indians
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
time
no
doubt
all
of
them
except
a
few
who
may
elect
to
make
their
homes
among
white
people
will
be
collected
there
as
a
preparatory
step
for
this
consummation
i
am
now
satisfied
that
a
territorial
form
of
government
should
be
given
them
which
will
secure
the
treaty
rights
of
the
original
settlers
and
protect
their
homesteads
from
alienation
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
the
operations
of
the
patent
office
are
growing
to
such
a
magnitude
and
the
accumulation
of
material
is
becoming
so
great
that
the
necessity
of
more
room
is
becoming
more
obvious
day
by
day
i
respectfully
invite
your
attention
to
the
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
commissioner
of
patents
on
this
subject
the
business
of
the
general
land
office
exhibits
a
material
increase
in
all
its
branches
during
the
last
fiscal
year
during
that
time
there
were
disposed
of
out
of
the
public
lands
acres
being
an
amount
greater
by
acres
than
was
disposed
of
during
the
preceding
year
of
the
amount
disposed
of
acres
were
sold

and

the

during
the

were
being
in
excess
of
the
re
ceipts
of
the
previous

during
the
year
acres
of

were
surveyed
an
increase
over
the
amount
surveyed
the
previous
year
of
acres
and
added
to
the
area
previously
surveyed
aggregates
acres
which
have
been
surveyed
leaving
acres
of
the
public
land
still
unsurveyed
the
increased
and
steadily
increasing
facilities
for
reaching
our
unoccupied
public
domain
and
for
the
transportation
of
surplus
products
enlarge
the
available
field
for
desirable
homestead
locations
thus
stimulating
settlement
and
extending
year
by
year
in
a
gradually
increasing
ratio
the
area
of
occupation
and
cultivation
the
expressed
desire
of
the
representatives
of
a
large
colony
of
citizens
of
russia
to
emigrate
to
this
country
as
is
understood
with
the
consent
of
their
government
if
certain
concessions
can
be
made
to
enable
them
to
settle
in
a
compact
colony
is
of
great
interest
as
going
to
show
the
light
in
which
our
institutions
are
regarded
by
an
industrious
intelligent
and
wealthy
people
desirous
of
enjoying
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
the
acquisition
of
so
large
an
immigration
of
citizens
of
a
superior
class
would
without
doubt
be
of
substantial
benefit
to
the
country
i
invite
attention
to
the
suggestion
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
this
behalf
there
was
paid
during
the
last
fiscal
year
for
pensions
including
the
expense
of
disbursement
being
an
amount
less
by
than
was
expended
for
the
same
purpose
the
preceding
year
although
this
statement
of
expenditures
would
indicate
a
material
reduction
in
amount
compared
with
the
preceding
year
it
is
believed
that
the
changes
in
the
pension
laws
at
the
last
session
of
congress
will
absorb
that
amount
the
current
year
at
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
there
were
on
the
pension
rolls
invalid
military
pensioners
and
widows
orphans
and
dependent
relatives
of
deceased
soldiers
making
a
total
of
that
class
of
survivors
of
the
war
of
and
widows
of
soldiers
of
that
war
pensioned
under
the
act
of
congress
of
february
making
a
total
of
that
class
of
invalid
navy
pensioners
and
widows
orphans
and
dependent
relatives
of
deceased
officers
sailors
and
marines
of
the
navy
making
a
total
of
navy
pensioners
of
and
a
grand
total
of
pensioners
of
classes
of
showing
a
net
increase
during
the
last
fiscal
year
of
during
the
last
year
the
names
of
pensioners
were
added
to
the
rolls
and
names
were
dropped
therefrom
for
various
causes
the
system
adopted
for
the
detection
of
frauds
against
the
government
in
the
matter
of
pensions
has
been
productive
of
satisfactory
results
but
legislation
is
needed
to
provide
if
possible
against
the
perpetration
of
such
frauds
in
future
the
evidently
increasing
interest
in
the
cause
of
education
is
a
most
encouraging
feature
in
the
general
progress
and
prosperity
of
the
country
and
the
bureau
of
education
is
earnest
in
its
efforts
to
give
proper
direction
to
the
new
appliances
and
increased
facilities
which
are
being
offered
to
aid
the
educators
of
the
country
in
their
great
work
the
ninth
census
has
been
completed
the
report
thereof
published
and
distributed
and
the
working
force
of
the
bureau
disbanded
the
secretary
of
the
interior
renews
his
recommendation
for
a
census
to
be
taken
in
to
which
subject
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
the
original
suggestion
in
that
behalf
has
met
with
the
general
approval
of
the
country
and
even
if
it
be
not
deemed
advisable
at
present
to
provide
for
a
regular
quinquennial
census
a
census
taken
in
the
report
of
which
could
be
completed
and
published
before
the
one
hundredth
anniversary
of
our
national
independence
would
be
especially
interesting
and
valuable
as
showing
the
progress
of
the
country
during
the
first
century
of
our
national
existence
it
is
believed
however
that
a
regular
census
every
five
years
would
be
of
substantial
benefit
to
the
country
inasmuch
as
our
growth
hitherto
has
been
so
rapid
that
the
results
of
the
decennial
census
are
necessarily
unreliable
as
a
basis
of
estimates
for
the
latter
years
of
a
decennial
period
district

under
the
very
efficient
management
of
the
governor
and
the
board
of
public
works
of
this
district
the
city
of
washington
is
rapidly
assuming
the
appearance
of
a
capital
of
which
the
nation
may
well
be
proud
from
being
a
most
unsightly
place
three
years
ago
disagreeable
to
pass
through
in
summer
in
consequence
of
the
dust
arising
from
unpaved
streets
and
almost
impassable
in
the
winter
from
the
mud
it
is
now
one
of
the
most
sightly
cities
in
the
country

boast

the
best

done

determined
upon

commenced
thus
securing

i
question
whether
so
much
has
ever
been
accomplished
before
in
any
american
city
for
the
same
expenditures
the
government
having
large
reservations
in
the
city
and
the
nation
at
large
having
an
interest
in
their
capital
i
recommend
a
liberal
policy
toward
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
the
government
should
bear
its
just
share
of
the
expense
of
these
improvements
every
citizen
visiting
the
capital
feels
a
pride
in
its
growing
beauty
and
that
he
too
is
part
owner
in
the
investments
made
here
i
would
suggest
to
congress
the
propriety
of
promoting
the
establishment
in
this
district
of
an
institution
of
learning
or
university
of
the
highest
class
by
the
donation
of
lands
there
is
no
place
better
suited
for
such
an
institution
than
the
national
capital
there
is
no
other
place
in
which
every
citizen
is
so
directly
interested
civilservice
reform
in
three
successive
messages
to
congress
i
have
called
attention
to
the
subject
of
civilservice
reform
action
has
been
taken
so
far
as
to
authorize
the
appointment
of
a
board
to
devise
rules
governing
methods
of
making
appointments
and
promotions
but
there
never
has
been
any
action
making
these
rules
or
any
rules
binding
or
even
entitled
to
observance
where
persons
desire
the
appointment
of
a
friend
or
the
removal
of
an
official
who
may
be
disagreeable
to
them
to
have
any
rules
effective
they
must
have
the
acquiescence
of
congress
as
well
as
of
the
executive
i
commend
therefore
the
subject
to
your
attention
and
suggest
that
a
special
committee
of
congress
might
confer
with
the
civilservice
board
during
the
present
session
for
the
purpose
of
devising
such
rules
as
can
be
maintained
and
which
will
secure
the
services
of
honest
and
capable
officials
and
which
will
also
protect
them
in
a
degree
of
independence
while
in
office
proper
rules
will
protect
congress
as
well
as
the
executive
from
much
needless
persecution
and
will
prove
of
great
value
to
the
public
at
large
i
would
recommend
for
your
favorable
consideration
the
passage
of
an
enabling
act
for
the
admission
of
colorado
as
a
state
in
the
union
it
possesses
all
the
elements
of
a
prosperous
state
agricultural
and
mineral
and
i
believe
has
a
population
now
to
justify
such
admission
in
connection
with
this
i
would
also
recommend
the
encouragement
of
a
canal
for
purposes
of
irrigation
from
the
eastern
slope
of
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
missouri
river
as
a
rule
i
am
opposed
to
further
donations
of
public
lands
for
internal
improvements
owned
and
controlled
by
private
corporations
but
in
this
instance
i
would
make
an
exception
between
the
missouri
river
and
the
rocky
mountains
there
is
an
arid
belt
of
public
land
from
to
miles
in
width
perfectly
valueless
for
the
occupation
of
man
for
the
want
of
sufficient
rain
to
secure
the
growth
of
any
product
an
irrigating
canal
would
make
productive
a
belt
as
wide
as
the
supply
of
water
could
be
made
to
spread
over
across
this
entire
country
and
would
secure
a
cordon
of
settlements
connecting
the
present
population
of
the
mountain
and
mining
regions
with
that
of
the
older
states
all
the
land
reclaimed
would
be
clear
gain
if
alternate
sections
are
retained
by
the
government
i
would
suggest
that
the
retained
sections
be
thrown
open
to
entry
under
the
homestead
laws
or
sold
to
actual
settlers
for
a
very
low
price
i
renew
my
previous
recommendation
to
congress
for
general
amnesty
the
number
engaged
in
the
late
rebellion
yet
laboring
under
disabilities
is
very
small
but
enough
to
keep
up
a
constant
irritation
no
possible
danger
can
accrue
to
the
government
by
restoring
them
to
eligibility
to
hold
office
i
suggest
for
your
consideration
the
enactment
of
a
law
to
better
secure
the
civil
rights
which
freedom
should
secure
but
has
not
effectually
secured
to
the
enfranchised
slave
u
s
grant

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
transmitting
to
you
this
my
fourth
annual
message
it
is
with
thankfulness
to
the
giver
of
all
good
that
as
a
nation
we
have
been
blessed
for
the
past
year
with
peace
at
home
peace
abroad
and
a
general
prosperity
vouchsafed
to
but
few
peoples
with
the
exception
of
the
recent
devastating
fire
which
swept
from
the
earth
with
a
breath
as
it
were
millions
of
accumulated
wealth
in
the
city
of
boston
there
has
been
no
overshadowing
calamity
within
the
year
to
record
it
is
gratifying
to
note
how
like
their
fellowcitizens
of
the
city
of
chicago
under
similar
circumstances
a
year
earlier
the
citizens
of
boston
are
rallying
under
their
misfortunes
and
the
prospect
that
their
energy
and
perseverance
will
overcome
all
obstacles
and
show
the
same
prosperity
soon
that
they
would
had
no
disaster
befallen
them
otherwise
we
have
been
free
from
pestilence
war
and
calamities
which
often
overtake
nations
and
as
far
as
human
judgment
can
penetrate
the
future
no
cause
seems
to
exist
to
threaten
our
present
peace
when
congress
adjourned
in
june
last
a
question
had
been
raised
by
great
britain
and
was
then
pending
which
for
a
time
seriously
imperiled
the
settlement
by
friendly
arbitration
of
the
grave
differences
between
this
government
and
that
of
her
britannic
majesty
which
by
the
treaty
of
washington
had
been
referred
to
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
which
had
met
at
geneva
in
switzerland
the
arbitrators
however
disposed
of
the
question
which
had
jeoparded
the
whole
of
the
treaty
and
threatened
to
involve
the
two
nations
in
most
unhappy
relations
toward
each
other
in
a
manner
entirely
satisfactory
to
this
government
and
in
accordance
with
the
views
and
the
policy
which
it
had
maintained
the
tribunal
which
had
convened
at
geneva
in
december
concluded
its
laborious
session
on
the
th
day
of
september
last
on
which
day
having
availed
itself
of
the
discretionary
power
given
to
it
by
the
treaty
to
award
a
sum
in
gross
it
made
its
decision
whereby
it
awarded
the
sum
of
in
gold
as
the
indemnity
to
be
paid
by
great
britain
to
the
united
states
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
the
claims
referred
to
its
consideration
this
decision
happily
disposes
of
a
longstanding
difference
between
the
two
governments
and
in
connection
with
another
award
made
by
the
german
emperor
under
a
reference
to
him
by
the
same
treaty
leaves
these
two
governments
without
a
shadow
upon
the
friendly
relations
which
it
is
my
sincere
hope
may
forever
remain
equally
unclouded
the
report
of
the
agent
of
the
united
states
appointed
to
attend
the
geneva
tribunal
accompanied
by
the
protocols
of
the
proceedings
of
the
arbitrators
the
arguments
of
the
counsel
of
both
governments
the
award
of
the
tribunal
and
the
opinions
given
by
the
several
arbitrators
is
transmitted
herewith
i
have
caused
to
be
communicated
to
the
heads
of
the
three
friendly
powers
who
complied
with
the
joint
request
made
to
them
under
the
treaty
the
thanks
of
this
government
for
the
appointment
of
arbitrators
made
by
them
respectively
and
also
my
thanks
to
the
eminent
personages
named
by
them
and
my
appreciation
of
the
dignity
patience
impartiality
and
great
ability
with
which
they
discharged
their
arduous
and
high
functions
her
majestys
government
has
communicated
to
me
the
appreciation
by
her
majesty
of
the
ability
and
indefatigable
industry
displayed
by
mr
adams
the
arbitrator
named
on
the
part
of
this
government
during
the
protracted
inquiries
and
discussions
of
the
tribunal
i
cordially
unite
with
her
majesty
in
this
appreciation
it
is
due
to
the
agent
of
the
united
states
before
the
tribunal
to
record
my
high
appreciation
of
the
marked
ability
unwearied
patience
and
the
prudence
and
discretion
with
which
he
has
conducted
the
very
responsible
and
delicate
duties
committed
to
him
as
it
is
also
due
to
the
learned
and
eminent
counsel
who
attended
the
tribunal
on
the
part
of
this
government
to
express
my
sense
of
the
talents
and
wisdom
which
they
brought
to
bear
in
the
attainment
of
the
result
so
happily
reached
it
will
be
the
province
of
congress
to
provide
for
the
distribution
among
those
who
may
be
entitled
to
it
of
their
respective
shares
of
the
money
to
be
paid
although
the
sum
awarded
is
not
payable
until
a
year
from
the
date
of
the
award
it
is
deemed
advisable
that
no
time
be
lost
in
making
a
proper
examination
of
the
several
cases
in
which
indemnification
may
be
due
i
consequently
recommend
the
creation
of
a
board
of
commissioners
for
the
purpose
by
the
thirtyfourth
article
of
the
treaty
of
washington
the
respective
claims
of
the
united
states
and
of
great
britain
in
their
construction
of
the
treaty
of
the
th
of
june
defining
the
boundary
line
between
their
respective
territories
were
submitted
to
the
arbitration
and
award
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
germany
to
decide
which
of
those
claims
is
most
in
accordance
with
the
true
interpretation
of
the
treaty
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
germany
having
been
pleased
to
undertake
the
arbitration
has
the
earnest
thanks
of
this
government
and
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
for
the
labor
pains
and
care
which
he
has
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
this
longpending
difference
i
have
caused
an
expression
of
my
thanks
to
be
communicated
to
his
majesty
mr
bancroft
the
representative
of
this
government
at
berlin
conducted
the
case
and
prepared
the
statement
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
with
the
ability
that
his
past
services
justified
the
public
in
expecting
at
his
hands
as
a
member
of
the
cabinet
at
the
date
of
the
treaty
which
has
given
rise
to
the
discussion
between
the
two
governments
as
the
minister
to
great
britain
when
the
construction
now
pronounced
unfounded
was
first
advanced
and
as
the
agent
and
representative
of
the
government
to
present
the
case
and
to
receive
the
award
he
has
been
associated
with
the
question
in
all
of
its
phases
and
in
every
stage
has
manifested
a
patriotic
zeal
and
earnestness
in
maintenance
of
the
claim
of
the
united
states
he
is
entitled
to
much
credit
for
the
success
which
has
attended
the
submission
after
a
patient
investigation
of
the
case
and
of
the
statements
of
each
party
his
majesty
the
emperor
on
the
st
day
of
october
last
signed
his
award
in
writing
decreeing
that
the
claim
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
the
boundary
line
between
the
territories
of
her
britannic
majesty
and
the
united
states
should
be
drawn
through
the
haro
channel
is
most
in
accordance
with
the
true
interpretation
of
the
treaty
concluded
on
the
th
of
june
between
the
governments
of
her
britannic
majesty
and
of
the
united
states
copies
of
the
case
presented
on
behalf
of
each
government
and
of
the
statement
in
reply
of
each
and
a
translation
of
the
award
are
transmitted
herewith
this
award
confirms
the
united
states
in
their
claim
to
the
important
archipelago
of
islands
lying
between
the
continent
and
vancouvers
island
which
for
more
than
twentysix
years
ever
since
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
great
britain
has
contested
and
leaves
us
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
as
a
nation
without
a
question
of
disputed
boundary
between
our
territory
and
the
possessions
of
great
britain
on
this
continent
it
is
my
grateful
duty
to
acknowledge
the
prompt
spontaneous
action
of
her
majestys
government
in
giving
effect
to
the
award
in
anticipation
of
any
request
from
this
government
and
before
the
reception
in
the
united
states
of
the
award
signed
by
the
emperor
her
majesty
had
given
instructions
for
the
removal
of
her
troops
which
had
been
stationed
there
and
for
the
cessation
of
all
exercise
or
claim
of
jurisdiction
so
as
to
leave
the
united
states
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
lately
disputed
territory
i
am
gratified
to
be
able
to
announce
that
the
orders
for
the
removal
of
the
troops
have
been
executed
and
that
the
military
joint
occupation
of
san
juan
has
ceased
the
islands
are
now
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
united
states
it
now
becomes
necessary
to
complete
the
survey
and
determination
of
that
portion
of
the
boundary
line
through
the
haro
channel
upon
which
the
commission
which
determined
the
remaining
part
of
the
line
were
unable
to
agree
i
recommend
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
act
jointly
with
one
which
may
be
named
by
her
majesty
for
that
purpose
experience
of
the
difficulties
attending
the
determination
of
our
admitted
line
of
boundary
after
the
occupation
of
the
territory
and
its
settlement
by
those
owing
allegiance
to
the
respective
governments
points
to
the
importance
of
establishing
by
natural
objects
or
other
monuments
the
actual
line
between
the
territory
acquired
by
purchase
from
russia
and
the
adjoining
possessions
of
her
britannic
majesty
the
region
is
now
so
sparsely
occupied
that
no
conflicting
interests
of
individuals
or
of
jurisdiction
are
likely
to
interfere
to
the
delay
or
embarrassment
of
the
actual
location
of
the
line
if
deferred
until
population
shall
enter
and
occupy
the
territory
some
trivial
contest
of
neighbors
may
again
array
the
two
governments
in
antagonism
i
therefore
recommend
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
act
jointly
with
one
that
may
be
appointed
on
the
part
of
great
britain
to
determine
the
line
between
our
territory
of
alaska
and
the
conterminous
possessions
of
great
britain
in
my
last
annual
message
i
recommended
the
legislation
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
bring
into
operation
the
articles
of
the
treaty
of
washington
of
may
relating
to
the
fisheries
and
to
other
matters
touching
the
relations
of
the
united
states
toward
the
british
north
american
possessions
to
become
operative
so
soon
as
the
proper
legislation
should
be
had
on
the
part
of
great
britain
and
its
possessions
that
legislation
on
the
part
of
great
britain
and
its
possessions
had
not
then
been
had
and
during
the
session
of
congress
a
question
was
raised
which
for
the
time
raised
a
doubt
whether
any
action
by
congress
in
the
direction
indicated
would
become
important
this
question
has
since
been
disposed
of
and
i
have
received
notice
that
th
e
imperial
parliament
and
the
legislatures
of
the
provincial
governments
have
passed
laws
to
carry
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
on
the
matters
referred
to
into
operation
i
therefore
recommend
your
early
adoption
of
the
legislation
in
the
same
direction
necessary
on
the
part
of
this
government
the
joint
commission
for
determining
the
boundary
line
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
possessions
between
the
lake
of
the
woods
and
the
rocky
mountains
has
organized
and
entered
upon
its
work
it
is
desirable
that
the
force
be
increased
in
order
that
the
completion
of
the
survey
and
determination
of
the
line
may
be
the
sooner
attained
to
this
end
i
recommend
that
a
sufficient
appropriation
be
made
with
france
our
earliest
ally
russia
the
constant
and
steady
friend
of
the
united
states
germany
with
whose
government
and
people
we
have
so
many
causes
of
friendship
and
so
many
common
sympathies
and
the
other
powers
of
europe
our
relations
are
maintained
on
the
most
friendly
terms
since
my
last
annual
message
the
exchange
has
been
made
of
the
ratifications
of
a
treaty
with
the
austrohungarian
empire
relating
to
naturalization
also
of
a
treaty
with
the
german
empire
respecting
consuls
and
trademarks
also
of
a
treaty
with
sweden
and
norway
relating
to
naturalization
all
of
which
treaties
have
been
duly
proclaimed
congress
at
its
last
session
having
made
an
appropriation
to
defray
the
expense
of
commissioners
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
the
international
statistical
congress
at
st
petersburg
the
persons
appointed
in
that
character
proceeded
to
their
destination
and
attended
the
sessions
of
the
congress
their
report
shall
in
due
season
be
laid
before
you
this
congress
meets
at
intervals
of
about
three
years
and
has
held
its
sessions
in
several
of
the
countries
of
europe
i
submit
to
your
consideration
the
propriety
of
extending
an
invitation
to
the
congress
to
hold
its
next
meeting
in
the
united
states
the
centennial
celebration
to
be
held
in
would
afford
an
appropriate
occasion
for
such
meeting
preparations
are
making
for
the
international
exposition
to
be
held
during
the
next
year
in
vienna
on
a
scale
of
very
great
magnitude
the
tendency
of
these
expositions
is
in
the
direction
of
advanced
civilization
and
of
the
elevation
of
industry
and
of
labor
and
of
the
increase
of
human
happiness
as
well
as
of
greater
intercourse
and
good
will
between
nations
as
this
exposition
is
to
be
the
first
which
will
have
been
held
in
eastern
europe
it
is
believed
that
american
inventors
and
manufacturers
will
be
ready
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
for
the
presentation
of
their
productions
if
encouraged
by
proper
aid
and
protection
at
the
last
session
of
congress
authority
was
given
for
the
appointment
of
one
or
more
agents
to
represent
this
government
at
the
exposition
the
authority
thus
given
has
been
exercised
but
in
the
absence
of
any
appropriation
there
is
danger
that
the
important
benefits
which
the
occasion
offers
will
in
a
large
degree
be
lost
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
i
commend
the
subject
strongly
to
your
consideration
and
recommend
that
an
adequate
appropriation
be
made
for
the
purpose
to
further
aid
american
exhibitors
at
the
vienna
exposition
i
would
recommend
in
addition
to
an
appropriation
of
money
that
the
secretary
of
the
navy
be
authorized
to
fit
up
two
naval
vessels
to
transport
between
our
atlantic
cities
and
trieste
or
the
most
convenient
port
to
vienna
and
back
their
articles
for
exhibition
since
your
last
session
the
president
of
the
mexican
republic
distinguished
by
his
high
character
and
by
his
services
to
his
country
has
died
his
temporary
successor
has
now
been
elected
with
great
unanimity
by
the
people
a
proof
of
confidence
on
their
part
in
his
patriotism
and
wisdom
which
it
is
believed
will
be
confirmed
by
the
results
of
his
administration
it
is
particularly
desirable
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
by
the
government
of
either
republic
to
strengthen
their
relations
as
neighbors
and
friends
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
many
lawless
acts
continue
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
settlements
on
the
border
between
our
territory
and
that
of
mexico
and
that
complaints
of
wrongs
to
american
citizens
in
various
parts
of
the
country
are
made
the
revolutionary
condition
in
which
the
neighboring
republic
has
so
long
been
involved
has
in
some
degree
contributed
to
this
disturbance
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
with
a
more
settled
rule
of
order
through
the
republic
which
may
be
expected
from
the
present
government
the
acts
of
which
just
complaint
is
made
will
cease
the
proceedings
of
the
commission
under
the
convention
with
mexico
of
the
th
of
july
on
the
subject
of
claims
have
unfortunately
been
checked
by
an
obstacle
for
the
removal
of
which
measures
have
been
taken
by
the
two
governments
which
it
is
believed
will
prove
successful
the
commissioners
appointed
pursuant
to
the
joint
resolution
of
congress
of
the
th
of
may
last
to
inquire
into
depredations
on
the
texan
frontier
have
diligently
made
investigations
in
that
quarter
their
report
upon
the
subject
will
be
communicated
to
you
their
researches
were
necessarily
incomplete
partly
on
account
of
the
limited
appropriation
made
by
congress
mexico
on
the
part
of
that
government
has
appointed
a
similar
commission
to
investigate
these
outrages
it
is
not
announced
officially
but
the
press
of
that
country
states
that
the
fullest
investigation
is
desired
and
that
the
cooperation
of
all
parties
concerned
is
invited
to
secure
that
end
i
therefore
recommend
that
a
special
appropriation
be
made
at
the
earliest
day
practicable
to
enable
the
commissioners
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
return
to
their
labors
without
delay
it
is
with
regret
that
i
have
again
to
announce
a
continuance
of
the
disturbed
condition
of
the
island
of
cuba
no
advance
toward
the
pacification
of
the
discontented
part
of
the
population
has
been
made
while
the
insurrection
has
gained
no
advantages
and
exhibits
no
more
of
the
elements
of
power
or
of
the
prospects
of
ultimate
success
than
were
exhibited
a
year
ago
spain
on
the
other
hand
has
not
succeeded
in
its
repression
and
the
parties
stand
apparently
in
the
same
relative
attitude
which
they
have
occupied
for
a
long
time
past
this
contest
has
lasted
now
for
more
than
four
years
were
its
scene
at
a
distance
from
our
neighborhood
we
might
be
indifferent
to
its
result
although
humanity
could
not
be
unmoved
by
many
of
its
incidents
wherever
they
might
occur
it
is
however
at
our
door
i
can
not
doubt
that
the
continued
maintenance
of
slavery
in
cuba
is
among
the
strongest
inducements
to
the
continuance
of
this
strife
a
terrible
wrong
is
the
natural
cause
of
a
terrible
evil
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
the
introduction
of
other
reforms
in
the
administration
of
government
in
cuba
could
not
fail
to
advance
the
restoration
of
peace
and
order
it
is
greatly
to
be
hoped
that
the
present
liberal
government
of
spain
will
voluntarily
adopt
this
view
the
law
of
emancipation
which
was
passed
more
than
two
years
since
has
remained
unexecuted
in
the
absence
of
regulations
for
its
enforcement
it
was
but
a
feeble
step
toward
emancipation
but
it
was
the
recognition
of
right
and
was
hailed
as
such
and
exhibited
spain
in
harmony
with
sentiments
of
humanity
and
of
justice
and
in
sympathy
with
the
other
powers
of
the
christian
and
civilized
world
within
the
past
few
weeks
the
regulations
for
carrying
out
the
law
of
emancipation
have
been
announced
giving
evidence
of
the
sincerity
of
intention
of
the
present
government
to
carry
into
effect
the
law
of
i
have
not
failed
to
urge
the
consideration
of
the
wisdom
the
policy
and
the
justice
of
a
more
effective
system
for
the
abolition
of
the
great
evil
which
oppresses
a
race
and
continues
a
bloody
and
destructive
contest
close
to
our
border
as
well
as
the
expediency
and
the
justice
of
conceding
reforms
of
which
the
propriety
is
not
questioned
deeply
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
the
continuance
of
slavery
is
one
of
the
most
active
causes
of
the
continuance
of
the
unhappy
condition
in
cuba
i
regret
to
believe
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
those
claiming
to
be
such
are
large
holders
in
cuba
of
what
is
there
claimed
as
property
but
which
is
forbidden
and
denounced
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
they
are
thus
in
defiance
of
the
spirit
of
our
own
laws
contributing
to
the
continuance
of
this
distressing
and
sickening
contest
in
my
last
annual
message
i
referred
to
this
subject
and
i
again
recommend
such
legislation
as
may
be
proper
to
denounce
and
if
not
prevent
at
least
to
discourage
american
citizens
from
holding
or
dealing
in
slaves
it
is
gratifying
to
announce
that
the
ratifications
of
the
convention
concluded
under
the
auspices
of
this
government
between
spain
on
the
one
part
and
the
allied
republics
of
the
pacific
on
the
other
providing
for
an
armistice
have
been
exchanged
a
copy
of
the
instrument
is
herewith
submitted
it
is
hoped
that
this
may
be
followed
by
a
permanent
peace
between
the
same
parties
the
differences
which
at
one
time
threatened
the
maintenance
of
peace
between
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
it
is
hoped
are
in
the
way
of
satisfactory
adjustment
with
these
states
as
with
the
republics
of
central
and
of
south
america
we
continue
to
maintain
the
most
friendly
relations
it
is
with
regret
however
i
announce
that
the
government
of
venezuela
has
made
no
further
payments
on
account
of
the
awards
under
the
convention
of
the
th
of
april
that
republic
is
understood
to
be
now
almost
if
not
quite
tranquilized
it
is
hoped
therefore
that
it
will
lose
no
time
in
providing
for
the
unpaid
balance
of
its
debt
to
the
united
states
which
having
originated
in
injuries
to
our
citizens
by
venezuelan
authorities
and
having
been
acknowledged
pursuant
to
a
treaty
in
the
most
solemn
form
known
among
nations
would
seem
to
deserve
a
preference
over
debts
of
a
different
origin
and
contracted
in
a
different
manner
this
subject
is
again
recommended
to
the
attention
of
congress
for
such
action
as
may
be
deemed
proper
our

treaty
relations
with
japan
remain
unchanged
an
imposing
embassy
from
that
interesting
and
progressive
nation
visited
this
country
during
the
year
that
is
passing
but
being
unprovided
with
powers
for
the
signing
of
a
convention
in
this
country
no
conclusion
in
that
direction
was
reached
it
is
hoped
however
that
the
interchange
of
opinions
which
took
place
during
their
stay
in
this
country
has
led
to
a
mutual
appreciation
of
the
interests
which
may
be
promoted
when
the
revision
of
the
existing
treaty
shall
be
undertaken
in
this
connection
i
renew
my
recommendation
of
one
year
ago
that
to
give
importance
to
and
to
add
to
the
efficiency
of
our
diplomatic
relations
with
japan
and
china
and
to
further
aid
in
retaining
the
good
opinion
of
those
peoples
and
to
secure
to
the
united
states
its
share
of
the
commerce
destined
to
flow
between
those
nations
and
the
balance
of
the
commercial
world
an
appropriation
be
made
to
support
at
least
four
american
youths
in
each
of
those
countries
to
serve
as
a
part
of
the
official
family
of
our
ministers
there
our
representatives
would
not
even
then
be
placed
upon
an
equality
with
the
representatives
of
great
britain
and
of
some
other
powers
as
now
situated
our
representatives
in
japan
and
china
have
to
depend
for
interpreters
and
translators
upon
natives
of
those
countries
who
know
our
language
imperfectly
or
procure
for
the
occasion
the
services
of
employees
in
foreign
business
houses
or
the
interpreters
to
other
foreign
ministers
i
renew
the
recommendation
made
on
a
previous
occasion
of
the
transfer
to
the
department
of
the
interior
to
which
they
seem
more
appropriately
to
belong
of
all
the
powers
and
duties
in
relation
to
the
territories
with
which
the
department
of
state
is
now
charged
by
law
or
by
custom
congress
from
the
beginning
of
the
government
has
wisely
made
provision
for
the
relief
of
distressed
seamen
in
foreign
countries
no
similar
provision
however
has
hitherto
been
made
for
the
relief
of
citizens
in
distress
abroad
other
than
seamen
it
is
understood
to
be
customary
with
other
governments
to
authorize
consuls
to
extend
such
relief
to
their
citizens
or
subjects
in
certain
cases
a
similar
authority
and
an
appropriation
to
carry
it
into
effect
are
recommended
in
the
case
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
destitute
or
sick
under
such
circumstances
it
is
well
known
that
such
citizens
resort
to
foreign
countries
in
great
numbers
though
most
of
them
are
able
to
bear
the
expenses
incident
to
locomotion
there
are
some
who
through
accident
or
otherwise
become
penniless
and
have
no
friends
at
home
able
to
succor
them
persons
in
this
situation
must
either
perish
cast
themselves
upon
the
charity
of
foreigners
or
be
relieved
at
the
private
charge
of
our
own
officers
who
usually
even
with
the
most
benevolent
dispositions
have
nothing
to
spare
for
such
purposes
should
the
authority
and
appropriation
asked
for
be
granted
care
will
be
taken
so
to
carry
the
beneficence
of
congress
into
effect
that
it
shall
not
be
unnecessarily
or
unworthily
bestowed
treasury
the
moneys
received
and

into

in
addressing
my
third
annual
message
to
the
lawmaking
branch
of
the
government
it
is
gratifying
to
be
able
to
state
that
during
the
past
year
success
has
generally
attended
the
effort
to
execute
all
laws
found
upon
the
statute
books
the
policy
has
been
not
to
inquire
into
the
wisdom
of
laws
already
enacted
but
to
learn
their
spirit
and
intent
and
to
enforce
them
accordingly
the
past
year
has
under
a
wise
providence
been
one
of
general
prosperity
to
the
nation
it
has
however
been
attended
with
more
than
usual
chastisements
in
the
loss
of
life
and
property
by
storm
and
fire
these
disasters
have
served
to
call
forth
the
best
elements
of
human
nature
in
our
country
and
to
develop
a
friendship
for
us
on
the
part
of
foreign
nations
which
goes
far
toward
alleviating
the
distresses
occasioned
by
these
calamities
the
benevolent
who
have
so
generously
shared
their
means
with
the
victims
of
these
misfortunes
will
reap
their
reward
in
the
consciousness
of
having
performed
a
noble
act
and
in
receiving
the
grateful
thanks
of
men
women
and
children
whose
sufferings
they
have
relieved
the
relations
of
the
united
states
with
foreign
powers
continue
to
be
friendly
the
year
has
been
an
eventful
one
in
witnessing
two
great
nations
speaking
one
language
and
having
one
lineage
settling
by
peaceful
arbitration
disputes
of
long
standing
and
liable
at
any
time
to
bring
those
nations
into
bloody
and
costly
conflict
an
example
has
thus
been
set
which
if
successful
in
its
final
issue
may
be
followed
by
other
civilized
nations
and
finally
be
the
means
of
returning
to
productive
industry
millions
of
men
now
maintained
to
settle
the
disputes
of
nations
by
the
bayonet
and
the
broadside
i
transmit
herewith
a
copy
of
the
treaty
alluded
to
which
has
been
concluded
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
with
her
britannic
majesty
and
a
copy
of
the
protocols
of
the
conferences
of
the
commissioners
by
whom
it
was
negotiated
this
treaty
provides
methods
for
adjusting
the
questions
pending
between
the
two
nations
various
questions
are
to
be
adjusted
by
arbitration
i
recommend
congress
at
an
early
day
to
make
the
necessary
provision
for
the
tribunal
at
geneva
and
for
the
several
commissioners
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
called
for
by
the
treaty
his
majesty
the
king
of
italy
the
president
of
the
swiss
confederation
and
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
brazil
have
each
consented
on
the
joint
request
of
the
two
powers
to
name
an
arbiter
for
the
tribunal
at
geneva
i
have
caused
my
thanks
to
be
suitably
expressed
for
the
readiness
with
which
the
joint
request
has
been
complied
with
by
the
appointment
of
gentlemen
of
eminence
and
learning
to
these
important
positions
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
germany
has
been
pleased
to
comply
with
the
joint
request
of
the
two
governments
and
has
consented
to
act
as
the
arbitrator
of
the
disputed
water
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
the
contracting
parties
in
the
treaty
have
undertaken
to
regard
as
between
themselves
certain
principles
of
public
law
for
which
the
united
states
have
contended
from
the
commencement
of
their
history
they
have
also
agreed
to
bring
those
principles
to
the
knowledge
of
the
other
maritime
powers
and
to
invite
them
to
accede
to
them
negotiations
are
going
on
as
to
the
form
of
the
note
by
which
the
invitation
is
to
be
extended
to
the
other
powers
i
recommend
the
legislation
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
bring
into
operation
the
articles
of
the
treaty
relating
to
the
fisheries
and
to
the
other
matters
touching
the
relations
of
the
united
states
toward
the
british
north
american
possessions
to
become
operative
so
soon
as
the
proper
legislation
shall
be
had
on
the
part
of
great
britain
and
its
possessions
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
this
legislation
may
become
operative
before
the
fishermen
of
the
united
states
begin
to
make
their
arrangements
for
the
coming
season
i
have
addressed
a
communication
of
which
a
copy
is
transmitted
herewith
to
the
governors
of
new
york
pennsylvania
ohio
indiana
michigan
illinois
and
wisconsin
urging
upon
the
governments
of
those
states
respectively
the
necessary
action
on
their
part
to
carry
into
effect
the
object
of
the
article
of
the
treaty
which
contemplates
the
use
of
the
canals
on
either
side
connected
with
the
navigation
of
the
lakes
and
rivers
forming
the
boundary
on
terms
of
equality
by
the
inhabitants
of
both
countries
it
is
hoped
that
the
importance
of
the
object
and
the
benefits
to
flow
therefrom
will
secure
the
speedy
approval
and
legislative
sanction
of
the
states
concerned
i
renew
the
recommendation
for
an
appropriation
for
determining
the
true
position
of
the
fortyninth
parallel
of
latitude
where
it
forms
the
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
north
american
possessions
between
the
lake
of
the
woods
and
the
summit
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
early
action
of
congress
on
this
recommendation
would
put
it
in
the
power
of
the
war
department
to
place
a
force
in
the
field
during
the
next
summer
the
resumption
of
diplomatic
relations
between
france
and
germany
has
enabled
me
to
give
directions
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
protection
extended
to
germans
in
france
by
the
diplomatic
and
consular
representatives
of
the
united
states
in
that
country
it
is
just
to
add
that
the
delicate
duty
of
this
protection
has
been
performed
by
the
minister
and
the
consulgeneral
at
paris
and
the
various
consuls
in
france
under
the
supervision
of
the
latter
with
great
kindness
as
well
as
with
prudence
and
tact
their
course
has
received
the
commendation
of
the
german
government
and
has
wounded
no
susceptibility
of
the
french
the
government
of
the
emperor
of
germany
continues
to
manifest
a
friendly
feeling
toward
the
united
states
and
a
desire
to
harmonize
with
the
moderate
and
just
policy
which
this
government
maintains
in
its
relations
with
asiatic
powers
as
well
as
with
the
south
american
republics
i
have
given
assurances
that
the
friendly
feelings
of
that
government
are
fully
shared
by
the
united
states
the
ratifications
of
the
consular
and
naturalization
conventions
with
the
austrohungarian
empire
have
been
exchanged
i
have
been
officially
informed
of
the
annexation
of
the
states
of
the
church
to
the
kingdom
of
italy
and
the
removal
of
the
capital
of
that
kingdom
to
rome
in
conformity
with
the
established
policy
of
the
united
states
i
have
recognized
this
change
the
ratifications
of
the
new
treaty
of
commerce
between
the
united
states
and
italy
have
been
exchanged
the
two
powers
have
agreed
in
this
treaty
that
private
property
at
sea
shall
be
exempt
from
capture
in
case
of
war
between
the
two
powers
the
united
states
have
spared
no
opportunity
of
incorporating
this
rule
into
the
obligation
of
nations
the
fortyfirst
congress
at
its
third
session
made
an
appropriation
for
the
organization
of
a
mixed
commission
for
adjudicating
upon
the
claims
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
against
spain
growing
out
of
the
insurrection
in
cuba
that
commission
has
since
been
organized
i
transmit
herewith
the
correspondence
relating
to
its
formation
and
its
jurisdiction
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
commission
will
afford
the
claimants
a
complete
remedy
for
their
injuries
it
has
been
made
the
agreeable
duty
of
the
united
states
to
preside
over
a
conference
at
washington
between
the
plenipotentiaries
of
spain
and
the
allied
south
american
republics
which
has
resulted
in
an
armistice
with
the
reasonable
assurance
of
a
permanent
peace
the
intimate
friendly
relations
which
have
so
long
existed
between
the
united
states
and
russia
continue
undisturbed
the
visit
of
the
third
son
of
the
emperor
is
a
proof
that
there
is
no
desire
on
the
part
of
his
government
to
diminish
the
cordiality
of
those
relations
the
hospitable
reception
which
has
been
given
to
the
grand
duke
is
a
proof
that
on
our
side
we
share
the
wishes
of
that
government
the
inexcusable
course
of
the
russian
minister
at
washington
rendered
it
necessary
to
ask
his
recall
and
to
decline
to
longer
receive
that
functionary
as
a
diplomatic
representative
it
was
impossible
with
selfrespect
or
with
a
just
regard
to
the
dignity
of
the
country
to
permit
mr
catacazy
to
continue
to
hold
intercourse
with
this
government
after
his
personal
abuse
of
government
officials
and
during
his
persistent
interferences
through
various
means
with
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
other
powers
in
accordance
with
my
wishes
this
government
has
been
relieved
of
further
intercourse
with
mr
catacazy
and
the
management
of
the
affairs
of
the
imperial
legation
has
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
gentleman
entirely
unobjectionable
with
japan
we
continue
to
maintain
intimate
relations
the
cabinet
of
the
mikado
has
since
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
congress
selected
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
serve
in
offices
of
importance
in
several
departments
of
government
i
have
reason
to
think
that
this
selection
is
due
to
an
appreciation
of
the
disinterestedness
of
the
policy
which
the
united
states
have
pursued
toward
japan
it
is
our
desire
to
continue
to
maintain
this
disinterested
and
just
policy
with
china
as
well
as
japan
the
correspondence
transmitted
herewith
shows
that
there
is
no
disposition
on
the
part
of
this
government
to
swerve
from
its
established
course
prompted
by
a
desire
to
put
an
end
to
the
barbarous
treatment
of
our
shipwrecked
sailors
on
the
korean
coast
i
instructed
our
minister
at
peking
to
endeavor
to
conclude
a
convention
with
korea
for
securing
the
safety
and
humane
treatment
of
such
mariners
admiral
rodgers
was
instructed
to
accompany
him
with
a
sufficient
force
to
protect
him
in
case
of
need
a
small
surveying
party
sent
out
on
reaching
the
coast
was
treacherously
attacked
at
a
disadvantage
ample
opportunity
was
given
for
explanation
and
apology
for
the
insult
neither
came
a
force
was
then
landed
after
an
arduous
march
over
a
rugged
and
difficult
country
the
forts
from
which
the
outrages
had
been
committed
were
reduced
by
a
gallant
assault
and
were
destroyed
havin
g
thus
punished
the
criminals
and
having
vindicated
the
honor
of
the
flag
the
expedition
returned
finding
it
impracticable
under
the
circumstances
to
conclude
the
desired
convention
i
respectfully
refer
to
the
correspondence
relating
thereto
herewith
submitted
and
leave
the
subject
for
such
action
as
congress
may
see
fit
to
take
the
republic
of
mexico
has
not
yet
repealed
the
very
objectionable
laws
establishing
what
is
known
as
the
free
zone
on
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
it
is
hoped
that
this
may
yet
be
done
and
also
that
more
stringent
measures
may
be
taken
by
that
republic
for
restraining
lawless
persons
on
its
frontiers
i
hope
that
mexico
by
its
own
action
will
soon
relieve
this
government
of
the
difficulties
experienced
from
these
causes
our
relations
with
the
various
republics
of
central
and
south
america
continue
with
one
exception
to
be
cordial
and
friendly
i
recommend
some
action
by
congress
regarding
the
overdue
installments
under
the
award
of
the
venezuelan
claims
commission
of
the
internal
dissensions
of
this
government
present
no
justification
for
the
absence
of
effort
to
meet
their
solemn
treaty
obligations
the
ratification
of
an
extradition
treaty
with
nicaragua
has
been
exchanged
it
is
a
subject
for
congratulation
that
the
great
empire
of
brazil
has
taken
the
initiatory
step
toward
the
abolition
of
slavery
our
relations
with
that
empire
always
cordial
will
naturally
be
made
more
so
by
this
act
it
is
not
too
much
to
hope
that
the
government
of
brazil
may
hereafter
find
it
for
its
interest
as
well
as
intrinsically
right
to
advance
toward
entire
emancipation
more
rapidly
than
the
present
act
contemplates
the
true
prosperity
and
greatness
of
a
nation
is
to
be
found
in
the
elevation
and
education
of
its
laborers
it
is
a
subject
for
regret
that
the
reforms
in
this
direction
which
were
voluntarily
promised
by
the
statesmen
of
spain
have
not
been
carried
out
in
its
west
india
colonies
the
laws
and
regulations
for
the
apparent
abolition
of
slavery
in
cuba
and
porto
rico
leave
most
of
the
laborers
in
bondage
with
no
hope
of
release
until
their
lives
become
a
burden
to
their
employers
i
desire
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
persons
claiming
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
are
large
holders
in
foreign
lands
of
this
species
of
property
forbidden
by
the
fundamental
law
of
their
alleged
country
i
recommend
to
congress
to
provide
by
stringent
legislation
a
suitable
remedy
against
the
holding
owning
or
dealing
in
slaves
or
being
interested
in
slave
property
in
foreign
lands
either
as
owners
hirers
or
mortgagors
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
disturbed
condition
of
the
island
of
cuba
continues
to
be
a
source
of
annoyance
and
of
anxiety
the
existence
of
a
protracted
struggle
in
such
close
proximity
to
our
own
territory
without
apparent
prospect
of
an
early
termination
can
not
be
other
than
an
object
of
concern
to
a
people
who
while
abstaining
from
interference
in
the
affairs
of
other
powers
naturally
desire
to
see
every
country
in
the
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
peace
liberty
and
the
blessings
of
free
institutions
our
naval
commanders
in
cuban
waters
have
been
instructed
in
case
it
should
become
necessary
to
spare
no
effort
to
protect
the
lives
and
property
of
bona
fide
american
citizens
and
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
the
flag
it
is
hoped
that
all
pending
questions
with
spain
growing
out
of
the
affairs
in
cuba
may
be
adjusted
in
the
spirit
of
peace
and
conciliation
which
has
hitherto
guided
the
two
powers
in
their
treatment
of
such
questions
to
give
importance
to
and
to
add
to
the
efficiency
of
our
diplomatic
relations
with
japan
and
china
and
to
further
aid
in
retaining
the
good
opinion
of
those
peoples
and
to
secure
to
the
united
states
its
share
of
the
commerce
destined
to
flow
between
those
nations
and
the
balance
of
the
commercial
world
i
earnestly
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
support
at
least
four
american
youths
in
each
of
those
countries
to
serve
as
a
part
of
the
official
family
of
our
ministers
there
our
representatives
would
not
even
then
be
placed
upon
an
equality
with
the
representatives
of
great
britain
and
of
some
other
powers
as
now
situated
our
representatives
in
japan
and
china
have
to
depend
for
interpreters
and
translators
upon
natives
of
those
countries
who
know
our
language
imperfectly
or
procure
for
the
occasion
the
services
of
employees
in
foreign
business
houses
or
the
interpreters
to
other
foreign
ministers
i
would
also
recommend
liberal
measures
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
the
american
lines
of
steamers
now
plying
between
san
francisco
and
japan
and
china
and
the
australian
linealmost
our
only
remaining
lines
of
ocean
steamersand
of
increasing
their
services
the
national
debt
has
been
reduced
to
the
extent
of
during
the
year
and
by
the
negotiation
of
national
bonds
at
a
lower
rate
of
interest
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
has
been
so
far
diminished
that
now
the
sum
to
be
raised
for
the
interest
account
is
nearly
less
than
on
the
st
of
march
it
was
highly
desirable
that
this
rapid
diminution
should
take
place
both
to
strengthen
the
credit
of
the
country
and
to
convince
its
citizens
of
their
entire
ability
to
meet
every
dollar
of
liability
without
bankrupting
them
but
in
view
of
the
accomplishment
of
these
desirable
ends
of
the
rapid
development
of
the
resources
of
the
country
its
increasing
ability
to
meet
large
demands
and
the
amount
already
paid
it
is
not
desirable
that
the
present
resources
of
the
country
should
continue
to
be
taxed
in
order
to
continue
this
rapid
payment
i
therefore
recommend
a
modification
of
both
the
tariff
and
internaltax
law
i
recommend
that
all
taxes
from
internal
sources
be
abolished
except
those
collected
from
spirituous
vinous
and
malt
liquors
tobacco
in
its
various
forms
and
from
stamps
in
readjusting
the
tariff
i
suggest
that
a
careful
estimate
be
made
of
the
amount
of
surplus
revenue
collected
under
the
present
laws
after
providing
for
the
current
expenses
of
the
government
the
interest
count
and
a
sinking
fund
and
that
this
surplus
be
reduced
in
such
a
manner
as
to
afford
the
greatest
relief
to
the
greatest
number
there
are
many
articles
not
produced
at
home
but
which
enter
largely
into
general
consumption
through
articles
which
are
manufactured
at
home
such
as
medicines
compounded
etc
etc
from
which
very
little
revenue
is
derived
but
which
enter
into
general
use
all
such
articles
i
recommend
to
be
placed
on
the
free
list
should
a
further
reduction
prove
advisable
i
would
then
recommend
that
it
be
made
upon
those
articles
which
can
best
bear
it
without
disturbing
home
production
or
reducing
the
wages
of
american
labor
i
have
not
entered
into
figures
because
to
do
so
would
be
to
repeat
what
will
be
laid
before
you
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
present
laws
for
collecting
revenue
pay
collectors
of
customs
small
salaries
but
provide
for
moieties
shares
in
all
seizures
which
at
principal
ports
of
entry
particularly
raise
the
compensation
of
those
officials
to
a
large
sum
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
as
if
this
system
must
at
times
work
perniciously
it
holds
out
an
inducement
to
dishonest
men
should
such
get
possession
of
those
offices
to
be
lax
in
their
scrutiny
of
goods
entered
to
enable
them
finally
to
make
large
seizures
your
attention
is
respectfully
invited
to
this
subject
continued
fluctuations
in
the
value
of
gold
as
compared
with
the
national
currency
has
a
most
damaging
effect
upon
the
increase
and
development
of
the
country
in
keeping
up
prices
of
all
articles
necessary
in
everyday
life
it
fosters
a
spirit
of
gambling
prejudicial
alike
to
national
morals
and
the
national
finances
if
the
question
can
be
met
as
to
how
to
get
a
fixed
value
to
our
currency
that
value
constantly
and
uniformly
approaching
par
with
specie
a
very
desirable
object
will
be
gained
for
the
operations
of
the
army
in
the
past
year
the
expense
of
maintaining
it
the
estimate
for
the
ensuing
year
and
for
continuing
seacoast
and
other
improvements
conducted
under
the
supervision
of
the
war
department
i
refer
you
to
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
i
call
your
attention
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
approved
march
which
discontinues
promotions
in
the
staff
corps
of
the
army
until
provided
for
by
law
i
recommend
that
the
number
of
officers
in
each
grade
in
the
staff
corps
be
fixed
and
that
whenever
the
number
in
any
one
grade
falls
below
the
number
so
fixed
that
the
vacancy
may
be
filled
by
promotion
from
the
grade
below
i
also
recommend
that
when
the
office
of
chief
of
a
corps
becomes
vacant
the
place
may
be
filled
by
selection
from
the
corps
in
which
the
vacancy
exists
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
shows
an
improvement
in
the
number
and
efficiency
of
the
naval
force
without
material
increase
in
the
expense
of
supporting
it
this
is
due
to
the
policy
which
has
been
adopted
and
is
being
extended
as
fast
as
our
material
will
admit
of
using
smaller
vessels
as
cruisers
on
the
several
stations
by
this
means
we
have
been
enabled
to
occupy
at
once
a
larger
extent
of
cruising
grounds
to
visit
more
frequently
the
ports
where
the
presence
of
our
flag
is
desirable
and
generally
to
discharge
more
efficiently
the
appropriate
duties
of
the
navy
in
time
of
peace
without
exceeding
the
number
of
men
or
the
expenditure
authorized
by
law
during
the
past
year
the
navy
has
in
addition
to
its
regular
service
supplied
the
men
and
officers
for
the
vessels
of
the
coast
survey
and
has
completed
the
surveys
authorized
by
congress
of
the
isthmuses
of
darien
and
tehuantepec
and
under
like
authority
has
sent
out
an
expedition
completely
furnished
and
equipped
to
explore
the
unknown
ocean
of
the
north
the
suggestions
of
the
report
as
to
the
necessity
for
increasing
and
improving
the
materiel
of
the
navy
and
the
plan
recommended
for
reducing
the
personnel
of
the
service
to
a
peace
standard
by
the
gradual
abolition
of
certain
grades
of
officers
the
reduction
of

others
and
the
employment
of
some
in
the
service
of
the
commercial
marine
are
well
considered
and
deserve
the
thoughtful
attention
of
congress
i
also
recommend
that
all
promotions
in
the
navy
above
the
rank
of
captain
be
by
selection
instead
of
by
seniority
this
course
will
secure
in
the
higher
grades
greater
efficiency
and
hold
out
an
incentive
to
young
officers
to
improve
themselves
in
the
knowledge
of
their
profession
the
present
cost
of
maintaining
the
navy
its
cost
compared
with
that
of
the
preceding
year
and
the
estimates
for
the
ensuing
year
are
contained
in
the
accompanying
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
enlarged
receipts
of
the
postoffice
department
as
shown
by
the
accompanying
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
exhibit
a
gratifying
increase
in
that
branch
of
the
public
service
it
is
the
index
of
the
growth
of
education
and
of
the
prosperity
of
the
people
two
elements
highly
conducive
to
the
vigor
and
stability
of
republics
with
a
vast
territory
like
ours
much
of
it
sparsely
populated
but
all
requiring
the
services
of
the
mail
it
is
not
at
present
to
be
expected
that
this
department
can
be
made
selfsustaining
but
a
gradual
approach
to
this
end
from
year
to
year
is
confidently
relied
on
and
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
the
postoffice
department
of
the
government
will
prove
a
much
greater
blessing
to
the
whole
people
than
it
is
now
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
for
improvements
in
the
department
presided
over
by
him
are
earnestly
recommended
to
you
special
attention
especially
do
i
recommend
favorable
consideration
of
the
plan
for
uniting
the
telegraphic
system
of
the
united
states
with
the
postal
system
it
is
believed
that
by
such
a
course
the
cost
of
telegraphing
could
be
much
reduced
and
the
service
as
well
if
not
better
rendered
it
would
secure
the
further
advantage
of
extending
the
telegraph
through
portions
of
the
country
where
private
enterprise
will
not
construct
it
commerce
trade
and
above
all
the
efforts
to
bring
a
people
widely
separated
into
a
community
of
interest
are
always
benefited
by
a
rapid
intercommunication
education
the
groundwork
of
republican
institutions
is
encouraged
by
increasing
the
facilities
to
gather
speedy
news
from
all
parts
of
the
country
the
desire
to
reap
the
benefit
of
such
improvements
will
stimulate
education
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
for
full
details
of
the
operations
of
last
year
and
for
comparative
statements
of
results
with
former
years
there
has
been
imposed
upon
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
the
execution
of
the
act
of
congress
approved
april
and
commonly
known
as
the
kuklux
law
in
a
portion
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
the
necessity
of
the
course
pursued
will
be
demonstrated
by
the
report
of
the
committee
to
investigate
southern
outrages
under
the
provisions
of
the
above
act
i
issued
a
proclamation
calling
the
attention
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
the
same
and
declaring
my
reluctance
to
exercise
any
of
the
extraordinary
powers
thereby
conferred
upon
me
except
in
case
of
imperative
necessity
but
making
known
my
purpose
to
exercise
such
powers
whenever
it
should
become
necessary
to
do
so
for
the
purpose
of
securing
to
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
the
rights
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
constitution
and
the
laws
after
the
passage
of
this
law
information
was
received
from
time
to
time
that
combinations
of
the
character
referred
to
in
this
law
existed
and
were
powerful
in
many
parts
of
the
southern
states
particularly
in
certain
counties
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
careful
investigation
was
made
and
it
was
ascertained
that
in
nine
counties
of
that
state
such
combinations
were
active
and
powerful
embracing
a
sufficient
portion
of
the
citizens
to
control
the
local
authority
and
having
among
other
things
the
object
of
depriving
the
emancipated
class
of
the
substantial
benefits
of
freedom
and
of
preventing
the
free
political
action
of
those
citizens
who
did
not
sympathize
with
their
own
views
among
their
operations
were
frequent
scourgings
and
occasional
assassinations
generally
perpetrated
at
night
by
disguised
persons
the
victims
in
almost
all
cases
being
citizens
of
different
political
sentiments
from
their
own
or
freed
persons
who
had
shown
a
disposition
to
claim
equal
rights
with
other
citizens
thousands
of
inoffensive
and
well
disposed
citizens
were
the
sufferers
by
this
lawless
violence
thereupon
on
the
th
of
october
a
proclamation
was
issued
in
terms
of
the
law
calling
upon
the
members
of
those
combinations
to
disperse
within
five
days
and
to
deliver
to
the
marshal
or
military
officers
of
the
united
states
all
arms
ammunition
uniforms
disguises
and
other
means
and
implements
used
by
them
for
carrying
out
their
unlawful
purposes
this
warning
not
having
been
heeded
on
the
th
of
october
another
proclamation
was
issued
suspending
the
privileges
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
nine
counties
in
that
state
direction
was
given
that
within
the
counties
so
designated
persons
supposed
upon
creditable
information
to
be
members
of
such
unlawful
combinations
should
be
arrested
by
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states
and
delivered
to
the
marshal
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
law
in
two
of
said
counties
york
and
spartanburg
many
arrests
have
been
made
at
the
last
account
the
number
of
persons
thus
arrested
was
several
hundred
whose
criminality
was
ascertained
to
be
of
an
inferior
degree
were
released
for
the
present
these
have
generally
made
confessions
of
their
guilt
great
caution
has
been
exercised
in
making
these
arrests
and
notwithstanding
the
large
number
it
is
believed
that
no
innocent
person
is
now
in
custody
the
prisoners
will
be
held
for
regular
trial
in
the
judicial
tribunals
of
the
united
states
as
soon
as
it
appeared
that
the
authorities
of
the
united
states
were
about
to
take
vigorous
measures
to
enforce
the
law
many
persons
absconded
and
there
is
good
ground
for
supposing
that
all
of
such
persons
have
violated
the
law
a
full
report
of
what
has
been
done
under
this
law
will
be
submitted
to
congress
by
the
attorneygeneral
in
utah
there
still
remains
a
remnant
of
barbarism
repugnant
to
civilization
to
decency
and
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
territorial
officers
however
have
been
found
who
are
willing
to
perform
their
duty
in
a
spirit
of
equity
and
with
a
due
sense
of
the
necessity
of
sustaining
the
majesty
of
the
law
neither
polygamy
nor
any
other
violation
of
existing
statutes
will
be
permitted
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
it
is
not
with
the
religion
of
the
selfstyled
saints
that
we
are
now
dealing
but
with
their
practices
they
will
be
protected
in
the
worship
of
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
consciences
but
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
violate
the
laws
under
the
cloak
of
religion
it
may
be
advisable
for
congress
to
consider
what
in
the
execution
of
the
laws
against
polygamy
is
to
be
the
status
of
plural
wives
and
their
offspring
the
propriety
of
congress
passing
an
enabling
act
authorizing
the
territorial
legislature
of
utah
to
legitimize
all
children
born
prior
to
a
time
fixed
in
the
act
might
be
justified
by
its
humanity
to
these
innocent
children
this
is
a
suggestion
only
and
not
a
recommendation
the
policy
pursued
toward
the
indians
has
resulted
favorably
so
far
as
can
be
judged
from
the
limited
time
during
which
it
has
been
in
operation
through
the
exertions
of
the
various
societies
of
christians
to
whom
has
been
intrusted
the
execution
of
the
policy
and
the
board
of
commissioners
authorized
by
the
law
of
april
many
tribes
of
indians
have
been
induced
to
settle
upon
reservations
to
cultivate
the
soil
to
perform
productive
labor
of
various
kinds
and
to
partially
accept
civilization
they
are
being
cared
for
in
such
a
way
it
is
hoped
as
to
induce
those
still
pursuing
their
old
habits
of
life
to
embrace
the
only
opportunity
which
is
left
them
to
avoid
extermination
i
recommend
liberal
appropriations
to
carry
out
the
indian
peace
policy
not
only
because
it
is
humane
christian
like
and
economical
but
because
it
is
right
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
also
the
policy
of
granting
a
territorial
government
to
the
indians
in
the
indian
territory
west
of
arkansas
and
missouri
and
south
of
kansas
in
doing
so
every
right
guaranteed
to
the
indian
by
treaty
should
be
secured
such
a
course
might
in
time
be
the
means
of
collecting
most
of
the
indians
now
between
the
missouri
and
the
pacific
and
south
of
the
british
possessions
into
one
territory
or
one
state
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
treated
upon
this
subject
at
length
and
i
commend
to
you
his
suggestions
i
renew
my
recommendation
that
the
public
lands
be
regarded
as
a
heritage
to
our
children
to
be
disposed
of
only
as
required
for
occupation
and
to
actual
settlers
those
already
granted
have
been
in
great
part
disposed
of
in
such
a
way
as
to
secure
access
to
the
balance
by
the
hardy
settler
who
may
wish
to
avail
himself
of
them
but
caution
should
be
exercised
even
in
attaining
so
desirable
an
object
educational
interest
may
well
be
served
by
the
grant
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
public
lands
to
settlers
i
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
as
recommending
in
the
least
degree
a
curtailment
of
what
is
being
done
by
the
general
government
for
the
encouragement
of
education
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
submitted
with
this
will
give
you
all
the
information
collected
and
prepared
for
publication
in
regard
to
the
census
taken
during
the
year
the
operations
of
the
bureau
of
education
for
the
year
the
patent
office
the
pension
office
the
land
office
and
the
indian
bureau
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
gives
the
operations
of
his
department
for
the
year
as
agriculture
is
the
groundwork
of
our
prosperity
too
much
importance
can
not
be
attached
to
the
labors
of
this
department
it
is
in
the
hands
of
an
able
head
with
able
assistants
all
zealously
devoted
to
introducing
into
the
agricultural
productions
of
the
nation
all
useful
products
adapted
to
any
of
the
vario
us
climates
and
soils
of
our
vast
territory
and
to
giving
all
useful
information
as
to
the
method
of
cultivation
the
plants
cereals
and
other
products
adapted
to
particular
localities
quietly
but
surely
the
agricultural
bureau
is
working
a
great
national
good
and
if
liberally
supported
the
more
widely
its
influence
will
be
extended
and
the
less
dependent
we
shall
be
upon
the
products
of
foreign
countries
the
subject
of
compensation
to
the
heads
of
bureaus
and
officials
holding
positions
of
responsibility
and
requiring
ability
and
character
to
fill
properly
is
one
to
which
your
attention
is
invited
but
few
of
the
officials
receive
a
compensation
equal
to
the
respectable
support
of
a
family
while
their
duties
are
such
as
to
involve
millions
of
interest
in
private
life
services
demand
compensation
equal
to
the
services
rendered
a
wise
economy
would
dictate
the
same
rule
in
the
government
service
i
have
not
given
the
estimates
for
the
support
of
government
for
the
ensuing
year
nor
the
comparative
statement
between
the
expenditures
for
the
year
just
passed
and
the
one
just
preceding
because
all
these
figures
are
contained
in
the
accompanying
reports
or
in
those
presented
directly
to
congress
these
estimates
have
my
approval
more
than
six
years
having
elapsed
since
the
last
hostile
gun
was
fired
between
the
armies
then
arrayed
against
each
otherone
for
the
perpetuation
the
other
for
the
destruction
of
the
unionit
may
well
be
considered
whether
it
is
not
now
time
that
the
disabilities
imposed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
removed
that
amendment
does
not
exclude
the
ballot
but
only
imposes
the
disability
to
hold
offices
upon
certain
classes
when
the
purity
of
the
ballot
is
secure
majorities
are
sure
to
elect
officers
reflecting
the
views
of
the
majority
i
do
not
see
the
advantage
or
propriety
of
excluding
men
from
office
merely
because
they
were
before
the
rebellion
of
standing
and
character
sufficient
to
be
elected
to
positions
requiring
them
to
take
oaths
to
support
the
constitution
and
admitting
to
eligibility
those
entertaining
precisely
the
same
views
but
of
less
standing
in
their
communities
it
may
be
said
that
the
former
violated
an
oath
while
the
latter
did
not
the
latter
did
not
have
it
in
their
power
to
do
so
if
they
had
taken
this
oath
it
can
not
be
doubted
they
would
have
broken
it
as
did
the
former
class
if
there
are
any
great
criminals
distinguished
above
all
others
for
the
part
they
took
in
opposition
to
the
government
they
might
in
the
judgment
of
congress
be
excluded
from
such
an
amnesty
this
subject
is
submitted
for
your
careful
consideration
the
condition
of
the
southern
states
is
unhappily
not
such
as
all
true
patriotic
citizens
would
like
to
see
social
ostracism
for
opinions
sake
personal
violence
or
threats
toward
persons
entertaining
political
views
opposed
to
those
entertained
by
the
majority
of
the
old
citizens
prevents
immigration
and
the
flow
of
muchneeded
capital
into
the
states
lately
in
rebellion
it
will
be
a
happy
condition
of
the
country
when
the
old
citizens
of
these
states
will
take
an
interest
in
public
affairs
promulgate
ideas
honestly
entertained
vote
for
men
representing
their
views
and
tolerate
the
same
freedom
of
expression
and
ballot
in
those
entertaining
different
political
convictions
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
approved
february
a
territorial
government
was
organized
in
the
district
of
columbia
its
results
have
thus
far
fully
realized
the
expectations
of
its
advocates
under
the
direction
of
the
territorial
officers
a
system
of
improvements
has
been
inaugurated
by
means
of
which
washington
is
rapidly
becoming
a
city
worthy
of
the
nations
capital
the
citizens
of
the
district
having
voluntarily
taxed
themselves
to
a
large
amount
for
the
purpose
of
contributing
to
the
adornment
of
the
seat
of
government
i
recommend
liberal
appropriations
on
the
part
of
congress
in
order
that
the
government
may
bear
its
just
share
of
the
expense
of
carrying
out
a
judicious
system
of
improvements
by
the
great
fire
in
chicago
the
most
important
of
the
government
buildings
in
that
city
were
consumed
those
burned
had
already
become
inadequate
to
the
wants
of
the
government
in
that
growing
city
and
looking
to
the
near
future
were
totally
inadequate
i
recommend
therefore
that
an
appropriation
be
made
immediately
to
purchase
the
remainder
of
the
square
on
which
the
burned
buildings
stood
provided
it
can
be
purchased
at
a
fair
valuation
or
provided
that
the
legislature
of
illinois
will
pass
a
law
authorizing
its
condemnation
for
government
purposes
and
also
an
appropriation
of
as
much
money
as
can
properly
be
expended
toward
the
erection
of
new
buildings
during
this
fiscal
year
the
number
of
immigrants
ignorant
of
our
laws
habits
etc
coming
into
our
country
annually
has
become
so
great
and
the
impositions
practiced
upon
them
so
numerous
and
flagrant
that
i
suggest
congressional
action
for
their
protection
it
seems
to
me
a
fair
subject
of
legislation
by
congress
i
can
not
now
state
as
fully
as
i
desire
the
nature
of
the
complaints
made
by
immigrants
of
the
treatment
they
receive
but
will
endeavor
to
do
so
during
the
session
of
congress
particularly
if
the
subject
should
receive
your
attention
it
has
been
the
aim
of
the
administration
to
enforce
honesty
and
efficiency
in
all
public
offices
every
public
servant
who
has
violated
the
trust
placed
in
him
has
been
proceeded
against
with
all
the
rigor
of
the
law
if
bad
men
have
secured
places
it
has
been
the
fault
of
the
system
established
by
law
and
custom
for
making
appointments
or
the
fault
of
those
who
recommend
for
government
positions
persons
not
sufficiently
well
known
to
them
personally
or
who
give
letters
indorsing
the
characters
of
office
seekers
without
a
proper
sense
of
the
grave
responsibility
which
such
a
course
devolves
upon
them
a
civilservice
reform
which
can
correct
this
abuse
is
much
desired
in
mercantile
pursuits
the
business
man
who
gives
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
a
friend
to
enable
him
to
obtain
credit
from
a
stranger
is
regarded
as
morally
responsible
for
the
integrity
of
his
friend
and
his
ability
to
meet
his
obligations
a
reformatory
law
which
would
enforce
this
principle
against
all
indorsers
of
persons
for
public
place
would
insure
great
caution
in
making
recommendations
a
salutary
lesson
has
been
taught
the
careless
and
the
dishonest
public
servant
in
the
great
number
of
prosecutions
and
convictions
of
the
last
two
years
it
is
gratifying
to
notice
the
favorable
change
which
is
taking
place
throughout
the
country
in
bringing
to
punishment
those
who
have
proven
recreant
to
the
trusts
confided
to
them
and
in
elevating
to
public
office
none
but
those
who
possess
the
confidence
of
the
honest
and
the
virtuous
who
it
will
always
be
found
comprise
the
majority
of
the
community
in
which
they
live
in
my
message
to
congress
one
year
ago
i
urgently
recommended
a
reform
in
the
civil
service
of
the
country
in
conformity
with
that
recommendation
congress
in
the
ninth
section
of
an
act
making
appropriations
for
sundry
civil
expenses
of
the
government
and
for
other
purposes
approved
march
gave
the
necessary
authority
to
the
executive
to
inaugurate
a
civilservice
reform
and
placed
upon
him
the
responsibility
of
doing
so
under
the
authority
of
said
act
i
convened
a
board
of
gentlemen
eminently
qualified
for
the
work
to
devise
rules
and
regulations
to
effect
the
needed
reform
their
labors
are
not
yet
complete
but
it
is
believed
that
they
will
succeed
in
devising
a
plan
that
can
be
adopted
to
the
great
relief
of
the
executive
the
heads
of
departments
and
members
of
congress
and
which
will
redound
to
the
true
interest
of
the
public
service
at
all
events
the
experiment
shall
have
a
fair
trial
i
have
thus
hastily
summed
up
the
operations
of
the
government
during
the
last
year
and
made
such
suggestions
as
occur
to
me
to
be
proper
for
your
consideration
i
submit
them
with
a
confidence
that
your
combined
action
will
be
wise
statesmanlike
and
in
the
best
interests
of
the
whole
country
u
s
grant

to
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
a
year
of
peace
and
general
prosperity
to
this
nation
has
passed
since
the
last
assembling
of
congress
we
have
through
a
kind
providence
been
blessed
with
abundant
crops
and
have
been
spared
from
complications
and
war
with
foreign
nations
in
our
midst
comparative
harmony
has
been
restored
it
is
to
be
regretted
however
that
a
free
exercise
of
the
elective
franchise
has
by
violence
and
intimidation
been
denied
to
citizens
in
exceptional
cases
in
several
of
the
states
lately
in
rebellion
and
the
verdict
of
the
people
has
thereby
been
reversed
the
states
of
virginia
mississippi
and
texas
have
been
restored
to
representation
in
our
national
councils
georgia
the
only
state
now
without
representation
may
confidently
be
expected
to
take
her
place
there
also
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
and
then
let
us
hope
will
be
completed
the
work
of
reconstruction
with
an
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
the
whole
people
in
the
national
obligation
to
pay
the
public
debt
created
as
the
price
of
our
union
the
pensions
to
our
disabled
soldiers
and
sailors
and
their
widows
and
orphans
and
in
the
changes
to
the
constitution
which
have
been
made
necessary
by
a
great
rebellion
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
advance
in
material
prosperity
and
happiness
as
no
other
nation
ever
did
after
so
protracted
and
devastating
a
war
soon
after
the
existing
war
broke
out
in
europe
the
protection
of
the
united
states
minister
in
paris
was
invoked
in
favor
of
north
germans
domiciled
in
french
territory
instructions
were
issued
to
grant
the
protection
this
has
been
followed
by
an
extension
of
american
protection
to
citizens
of
saxony
hesse
and
saxecoburg
gotha
colombia
portugal
uruguay
the
dominican
republic
ecuador
chile
paraguay
and
venezuela
in
paris
the
charge
was
an
onerous
one
requiring
constant
and
severe
labor
as
well
as
the
exercise
of
patience
prudence
and
good
judgment
it
has
been
performed
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
this
government
and
as
i
am
officially
informed
equally
so
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
government
of
north
germany
as
soon
as
i
learned
that
a
republic
had
been
proclaimed
at
paris
and
that
the
people
of
france
had
acquiesced
in
the
change
the
minister
of
the
united
states
was
directed
by
telegraph
to
recognize
it
and
to
tender
my
congratulations
and
those
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
reestablishment
in
france
of
a
system
of
government
disconnected
with
the
dynastic
traditions
of
europe
appeared
to
be
a
proper
subject
for
the
felicitations
of
americans
should
the
present
struggle
result
in
attaching
the
hearts
of
the
french
to
our
simpler
forms
of
representative
government
it
will
be
a
subject
of
still
further
satisfaction
to
our
people
while
we
make
no
effort
to
impose
our
institutions
upon
the
inhabitants
of
other
countries
and
while
we
adhere
to
our
traditional
neutrality
in
civil
contests
elsewhere
we
can
not
be
indifferent
to
the
spread
of
american
political
ideas
in
a
great
and
highly
civilized
country
like
france
we
were
asked
by
the
new
government
to
use
our
good
offices
jointly
with
those
of
european
powers
in
the
interests
of
peace
answer
was
made
that
the
established
policy
and
the
true
interests
of
the
united
states
forbade
them
to
interfere
in
european
questions
jointly
with
european
powers
i
ascertained
informally
and
unofficially
that
the
government
of
north
germany
was
not
then
disposed
to
listen
to
such
representations
from
any
power
and
though
earnestly
wishing
to
see
the
blessings
of
peace
restored
to
the
belligerents
with
all
of
whom
the
united
states
are
on
terms
of
friendship
i
declined
on
the
part
of
this
government
to
take
a
step
which
could
only
result
in
injury
to
our
true
interests
without
advancing
the
object
for
which
our
intervention
was
invoked
should
the
time
come
when
the
action
of
the
united
states
can
hasten
the
return
of
peace
by
a
single
hour
that
action
will
be
heartily
taken
i
deemed
it
prudent
in
view
of
the
number
of
persons
of
german
and
french
birth
living
in
the
united
states
to
issue
soon
after
official
notice
of
a
state
of
war
had
been
received
from
both
belligerents
a
proclamation
defining
the
duties
of
the
united
states
as
a
neutral
and
the
obligations
of
persons
residing
within
their
territory
to
observe
their
laws
and
the
laws
of
nations
this
proclamation
was
followed
by
others
as
circumstances
seemed
to
call
for
them
the
people
thus
acquainted
in
advance
of
their
duties
and
obligations
have
assisted
in
preventing
violations
of
the
neutrality
of
the
united
states
it
is
not
understood
that
the
condition
of
the
insurrection
in
cuba
has
materially
changed
since
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
congress
in
an
early
stage
of
the
contest
the
authorities
of
spain
inaugurated
a
system
of
arbitrary
arrests
of
close
confinement
and
of
military
trial
and
execution
of
persons
suspected
of
complicity
with
the
insurgents
and
of
summary
embargo
of
their
properties
and
sequestration
of
their
revenues
by
executive
warrant
such
proceedings
so
far
as
they
affected
the
persons
or
property
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
were
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
between
the
united
states
and
spain
representations
of
injuries
resulting
to
several
persons
claiming
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
by
reason
of
such
violations
were
made
to
the
spanish
government
from
april
to
june
last
the
spanish
minister
at
washington
had
been
clothed
with
a
limited
power
to
aid
in
redressing
such
wrongs
that
power
was
found
to
be
withdrawn
in
view
as
it
was
said
of
the
favorable
situation
in
which
the
island
of
cuba
then
was
which
however
did
not
lead
to
a
revocation
or
suspension
of
the
extraordinary
and
arbitrary
functions
exercised
by
the
executive
power
in
cuba
and
we
were
obliged
to
make
our
complaints
at
madrid
in
the
negotiations
thus
opened
and
still
pending
there
the
united
states
only
claimed
that
for
the
future
the
rights
secured
to
their
citizens
by
treaty
should
be
respected
in
cuba
and
that
as
to
the
past
a
joint
tribunal
should
be
established
in
the
united
states
with
full
jurisdiction
over
all
such
claims
before
such
an
impartial
tribunal
each
claimant
would
be
required
to
prove
his
case
on
the
other
hand
spain
would
be
at
liberty
to
traverse
every
material
fact
and
thus
complete
equity
would
be
done
a
case
which
at
one
time
threatened
seriously
to
affect
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
spain
has
already
been
disposed
of
in
this
way
the
claim
of
the
owners
of
the
colonel
lloyd
aspinwall
for
the
illegal
seizure
and
detention
of
that
vessel
was
referred
to
arbitration
by
mutual
consent
and
has
resulted
in
an
award
to
the
united
states
for
the
owners
of
the
sum
of
in
gold
another
and
longpending
claim
of
like
nature
that
of
the
whaleship
canada
has
been
disposed
of
by
friendly
arbitrament
during
the
present
year
it
was
referred
by
the
joint
consent
of
brazil
and
the
united
states
to
the
decision
of
sir
edward
thornton
her
britannic
majestys
minister
at
washington
who
kindly
undertook
the
laborious
task
of
examining
the
voluminous
mass
of
correspondence
and
testimony
submitted
by
the
two
governments
and
awarded
to
the
united
states
the
sum
of
in
gold
which
has
since
been
paid
by
the
imperial
government
these
recent
examples
show
that
the
mode
which
the
united
states
have
proposed
to
spain
for
adjusting
the
pending
claims
is
just
and
feasible
and
that
it
may
be
agreed
to
by
either
nation
without
dishonor
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
moderate
demand
may
be
acceded
to
by
spain
without
further
delay
should
the
pending
negotiations
unfortunately
and
unexpectedly
be
without
result
it
will
then
become
my
duty
to
communicate
that
fact
to
congress
and
invite
its
action
on
the
subject
the
longdeferred
peace
conference
between
spain
and
the
allied
south
american
republics
has
been
inaugurated
in
washington
under
the
auspices
of
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
recommendation
contained
in
the
resolution
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
th
of
december
the
executive
department
of
the
government
offered
its
friendly
offices
for
the
promotion
of
peace
and
harmony
between
spain
and
the
allied
republics
hesitations
and
obstacles
occurred
to
the
acceptance
of
the
offer
ultimately
however
a
conference
was
arranged
and
was
opened
in
this
city
on
the
th
of
october
last
at
which
i
authorized
the
secretary
of
state
to
preside
it
was
attended
by
the
ministers
of
spain
peru
chile
and
ecuador
in
consequence
of
the
absence
of
a
representative
from
bolivia
the
conference
was
adjourned
until
the
attendance
of
a
plenipotentiary
from
that
republic
could
be
secured
or
other
measures
could
be
adopted
toward
compassing
its
objects
the
allied
and
other
republics
of
spanish
origin
on
this
continent
may
see
in
this
fact
a
new
proof
of
our
sincere
interest
in
their
welfare
of
our
desire
to
see
them
blessed
with
good
governments
capable
of
maintaining
order
and
of
preserving
their
respective
territorial
integrity
and
of
our
sincere
wish
to
extend
our
own
commercial
and
social
relations
with
them
the
time
is
not
probably
far
distant
when
in
the
natural
course
of
events
the
european
political
connection
with
this
continent
will
cease
our
policy
should
be
shaped
in
view
of
this
probability
so
as
to
ally
the
commercial
interests
of
the
spanish
american
states
more
closely
to
our
own
and
thus
give
the
united
states
all
the
preeminence
and
all
the
advantage
which
mr
monroe
mr
adams
and
mr
clay
contemplated
when
they
proposed
to
join
in
the
congress
of
panama
during
the
last
session
of
congress
a
treaty
for
the
annexation
of
the
republic
of
san
domingo
to
the
united
states
failed
to
receive
the
requisite
twothirds
vote
of
the
senate
i
was
thoroughly
convinced
then
that
the
best
interests
of
this
country
commercially
and
materially
demanded
its
ratification
time
has
only
confirmed
me
in
this
view
i
now
firmly
believe
that
the
moment
it
is
known
that
the
united
states
have
entirely
abandoned
the
project
of
accepting
as
a
part
of
its
territory
the
island
of
san
dom
ingo
a
free
port
will
be
negotiated
for
by
european
nations
in
the
bay
of
samana
a
large
commercial
city
will
spring
up
to
which
we
will
be
tributary
without
receiving
corresponding
benefits
and
then
will
be
seen
the
folly
of
our
rejecting
so
great
a
prize
the
government
of
san
domingo
has
voluntarily
sought
this
annexation
it
is
a
weak
power
numbering
probably
less
than
souls
and
yet
possessing
one
of
the
richest
territories
under
the
sun
capable
of
supporting
a
population
of
people
in
luxury
the
people
of
san
domingo
are
not
capable
of
maintaining
themselves
in
their
present
condition
and
must
look
for
outside
support
they
yearn
for
the
protection
of
our
free
institutions
and
laws
our
progress
and
civilization
shall
we
refuse
them
the
acquisition
of
san
domingo
is
desirable
because
of
its
geographical
position
it
commands
the
entrance
to
the
caribbean
sea
and
the
isthmus
transit
of
commerce
it
possesses
the
richest
soil
best
and
most
capacious
harbors
most
salubrious
climate
and
the
most
valuable
products
of
the
forests
mine
and
soil
of
any
of
the
west
india
islands
its
possession
by
us
will
in
a
few
years
build
up
a
coastwise
commerce
of
immense
magnitude
which
will
go
far
toward
restoring
to
us
our
lost
merchant
marine
it
will
give
to
us
those
articles
which
we
consume
so
largely
and
do
not
produce
thus
equalizing
our
exports
and
imports
in
case
of
foreign
war
it
will
give
us
command
of
all
the
islands
referred
to
and
thus
prevent
an
enemy
from
ever
again
possessing
himself
of
rendezvous
upon
our
very
coast
at
present
our
coast
trade
between
the
states
bordering
on
the
atlantic
and
those
bordering
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
cut
into
by
the
bahamas
and
the
antilies
twice
we
must
as
it
were
pass
through
foreign
countries
to
get
by
sea
from
georgia
to
the
west
coast
of
florida
san
domingo
with
a
stable
government
under
which
her
immense
resources
can
be
developed
will
give
remunerative
wages
to
tens
of
thousands
of
laborers
not
now
upon
the
island
this
labor
will
take
advantage
of
every
available
means
of
transportation
to
abandon
the
adjacent
islands
and
seek
the
blessings
of
freedom
and
its
sequenceeach
inhabitant
receiving
the
reward
of
his
own
labor
porto
rico
and
cuba
will
have
to
abolish
slavery
as
a
measure
of
selfpreservation
to
retain
their
laborers
san
domingo
will
become
a
large
consumer
of
the
products
of
northern
farms
and
manufactories
the
cheap
rate
at
which
her
citizens
can
be
furnished
with
food
tools
and
machinery
will
make
it
necessary
that
contiguous
islands
should
have
the
same
advantages
in
order
to
compete
in
the
production
of
sugar
coffee
tobacco
tropical
fruits
etc
this
will
open
to
us
a
still
wider
market
for
our
products
the
production
of
our
own
supply
of
these
articles
will
cut
off
more
than
one
hundred
millions
of
our
annual
imports
besides
largely
increasing
our
exports
with
such
a
picture
it
is
easy
to
see
how
our
large
debt
abroad
is
ultimately
to
be
extinguished
with
a
balance
of
trade
against
us
including
interest
on
bonds
held
by
foreigners
and
money
spent
by
our
citizens
traveling
in
foreign
lands
equal
to
the
entire
yield
of
the
precious
metals
in
this
country
it
is
not
so
easy
to
see
how
this
result
is
to
be
otherwise
accomplished
the
acquisition
of
san
domingo
is
an
adherence
to
the
monroe
doctrine
it
is
a
measure
of
national
protection
it
is
asserting
our
just
claim
to
a
controlling
influence
over
the
great
commercial
traffic
soon
to
flow
from
west
to
east
by
way
of
the
isthmus
of
darien
it
is
to
build
up
our
merchant
marine
it
is
to
furnish
new
markets
for
the
products
of
our
farms
shops
and
manufactories
it
is
to
make
slavery
insupportable
in
cuba
and
porto
rico
at
once
and
ultimately
so
in
brazil
it
is
to
settle
the
unhappy
condition
of
cuba
and
end
an
exterminating
conflict
it
is
to
provide
honest
means
of
paying
our
honest
debts
without
overtaxing
the
people
it
is
to
furnish
our
citizens
with
the
necessaries
of
everyday
life
at
cheaper
rates
than
ever
before
and
it
is
in
fine
a
rapid
stride
toward
that
greatness
which
the
intelligence
industry
and
enterprise
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
entitle
this
country
to
assume
among
nations
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this
question
i
earnestly
urge
upon
congress
early
action
expressive
of
its
views
as
to
the
best
means
of
acquiring
san
domingo
my
suggestion
is
that
by
joint
resolution
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
the
executive
be
authorized
to
appoint
a
commission
to
negotiate
a
treaty
with
the
authorities
of
san
domingo
for
the
acquisition
of
that
island
and
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
defray
the
expenses
of
such
a
commission
the
question
may
then
be
determined
either
by
the
action
of
the
senate
upon
the
treaty
or
the
joint
action
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
upon
a
resolution
of
annexation
as
in
the
case
of
the
acquisition
of
texas
so
convinced
am
i
of
the
advantages
to
flow
from
the
acquisition
of
san
domingo
and
of
the
great
disadvantagesi
might
almost
say
calamitiesto
flow
from
nonacquisition
that
i
believe
the
subject
has
only
to
be
investigated
to
be
approved
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
our
representations
in
regard
to
the
injurious
effects
especially
upon
the
revenue
of
the
united
states
of
the
policy
of
the
mexican
government
in
exempting
from
impost
duties
a
large
tract
of
its
territory
on
our
borders
have
not
only
been
fruitless
but
that
it
is
even
proposed
in
that
country
to
extend
the
limits
within
which
the
privilege
adverted
to
has
hitherto
been
enjoyed
the
expediency
of
taking
into
your
serious
consideration
proper
measures
for
countervailing
the
policy
referred
to
will
it
is
presumed
engage
your
earnest
attention
it
is
the
obvious
interest
especially
of
neighboring
nations
to
provide
against
impunity
to
those
who
may
have
committed
high
crimes
within
their
borders
and
who
may
have
sought
refuge
abroad
for
this
purpose
extradition
treaties
have
been
concluded
with
several
of
the
central
american
republics
and
others
are
in
progress
the
sense
of
congress
is
desired
as
early
as
may
be
convenient
upon
the
proceedings
of
the
commission
on
claims
against
venezuela
as
communicated
in
my
messages
of
march
march
and
march
it
has
not
been
deemed
advisable
to
distribute
any
of
the
money
which
has
been
received
from
that
government
until
congress
shall
have
acted
on
the
subject
the
massacres
of
french
and
russian
residents
at
tientsin
under
circumstances
of
great
barbarity
was
supposed
by
some
to
have
been
premeditated
and
to
indicate
a
purpose
among
the
populace
to
exterminate
foreigners
in
the
chinese
empire
the
evidence
fails
to
establish
such
a
supposition
but
shows
a
complicity
between
the
local
authorities
and
the
mob
the
government
at
peking
however
seems
to
have
been
disposed
to
fulfill
its
treaty
obligations
so
far
as
it
was
able
to
do
so
unfortunately
the
news
of
the
war
between
the
german
states
and
france
reached
china
soon
after
the
massacre
it
would
appear
that
the
popular
mind
became
possessed
with
the
idea
that
this
contest
extending
to
chinese
waters
would
neutralize
the
christian
influence
and
power
and
that
the
time
was
coming
when
the
superstitious
masses
might
expel
all
foreigners
and
restore
mandarin
influence
anticipating
trouble
from
this
cause
i
invited
france
and
north
germany
to
make
an
authorized
suspension
of
hostilities
in
the
east
where
they
were
temporarily
suspended
by
act
of
the
commanders
and
to
act
together
for
the
future
protection
in
china
of
the
lives
and
properties
of
americans
and
europeans
since
the
adjournment
of
congress
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
with
great
britain
for
abolishing
the
mixed
courts
for
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
have
been
exchanged
it
is
believed
that
the
slave
trade
is
now
confined
to
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
whence
the
slaves
are
taken
to
arabian
markets
the
ratifications
of
the
naturalization
convention
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
have
also
been
exchanged
during
the
recess
and
thus
a
longstanding
dispute
between
the
two
governments
has
been
settled
in
accordance
with
the
principles
always
contended
for
by
the
united
states
in
april
last
while
engaged
in
locating
a
military
reservation
near
pembina
a
corps
of
engineers
discovered
that
the
commonly
received
boundary
line
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
possessions
at
that
place
is
about
feet
south
of
the
true
position
of
the
fortyninth
parallel
and
that
the
line
when
run
on
what
is
now
supposed
to
be
the
true
position
of
that
parallel
would
leave
the
fort
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
at
pembina
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
this
information
being
communicated
to
the
british
government
i
was
requested
to
consent
and
did
consent
that
the
british
occupation
of
the
fort
of
the
hudsons
bay
company
should
continue
for
the
present
i
deem
it
important
however
that
this
part
of
the
boundary
line
should
be
definitely
fixed
by
a
joint
commission
of
the
two
governments
and
i
submit
herewith
estimates
of
the
expense
of
such
a
commission
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
and
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
for
that
purpose
the
land
boundary
has
already
been
fixed
and
marked
from
the
summit
of
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
georgian
bay
it
should
now
be
in
like
manner
marked
from
the
lake
of
the
woods
to
the
summit
of
the
rocky
mountains
i
regret
to
say
that
no
conclusion
has
been
reached
for
the
adjustment
of
the
claims
against
great
britain
growing
out
of
the
course
adopted
by
that
government
during
the
rebellion
the
cabinet
of
london
so
far
as
its
views
have
been
expressed
does
not
appear
to
be
willing
to
concede
that
her
majestys
government
was
guilty
of
any
negligence
or
did
or
permitted
any
act
during
the
war
by
which
the
united
states
has
just
cause
of
complaint
our
firm
and
unalterable
convictions
are
directly
the
reverse
i
therefore
recommend
to
congress
to
authorize
the
appointment
of
a
commission
to
take
proof
of
the
amount
and
the
ownership
of
these
several
claims
on
notice
to
the
representative
of
her
majesty
at
washington
and
that
authority

be
given
for
the
settlement
of
these
claims
by
the
united
states
so
that
the
government
shall
have
the
ownership
of
the
private
claims
as
well
as
the
responsible
control
of
all
the
demands
against
great
britain
it
can
not
be
necessary
to
add
that
whenever
her
majestys
government
shall
entertain
a
desire
for
a
full
and
friendly
adjustment
of
these
claims
the
united
states
will
enter
upon
their
consideration
with
an
earnest
desire
for
a
conclusion
consistent
with
the
honor
and
dignity
of
both
nations
the
course
pursued
by
the
canadian
authorities
toward
the
fishermen
of
the
united
states
during
the
past
season
has
not
been
marked
by
a
friendly
feeling
by
the
first
article
of
the
convention
of
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
it
was
agreed
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
should
have
forever
in
common
with
british
subjects
the
right
of
taking
fish
in
certain
waters
therein
defined
in
the
waters
not
included
in
the
limits
named
in
the
convention
within
miles
of
parts
of
the
british
coast
it
has
been
the
custom
for
many
years
to
give
to
intruding
fishermen
of
the
united
states
a
reasonable
warning
of
their
violation
of
the
technical
rights
of
great
britain
the
imperial
government
is
understood
to
have
delegated
the
whole
or
a
share
of
its
jurisdiction
or
control
of
these
inshore
fishing
grounds
to
the
colonial
authority
known
as
the
dominion
of
canada
and
this
semiindependent
but
irresponsible
agent
has
exercised
its
delegated
powers
in
an
unfriendly
way
vessels
have
been
seized
without
notice
or
warning
in
violation
of
the
custom
previously
prevailing
and
have
been
taken
into
the
colonial
ports
their
voyages
broken
up
and
the
vessels
condemned
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
this
unfriendly
and
vexatious
treatment
was
designed
to
bear
harshly
upon
the
hardy
fishermen
of
the
united
states
with
a
view
to
political
effect
upon
this
government
the
statutes
of
the
dominion
of
canada
assume
a
still
broader
and
more
untenable
jurisdiction
over
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
they
authorize
officers
or
persons
to
bring
vessels
hovering
within
marine
miles
of
any
of
the
coasts
bays
creeks
or
harbors
of
canada
into
port
to
search
the
cargo
to
examine
the
master
on
oath
touching
the
cargo
and
voyage
and
to
inflict
upon
him
a
heavy
pecuniary
penalty
if
true
answers
are
not
given
and
if
such
a
vessel
is
found
preparing
to
fish
within
marine
miles
of
any
of
such
coasts
bays
creeks
or
harbors
without
a
license
or
after
the
expiration
of
the
period
named
in
the
last
license
granted
to
it
they
provide
that
the
vessel
with
her
tackle
etc
shall
be
forfeited
it
is
not
known
that
any
condemnations
have
been
made
under
this
statute
should
the
authorities
of
canada
attempt
to
enforce
it
it
will
become
my
duty
to
take
such
steps
as
may
be
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
it
has
been
claimed
by
her
majestys
officers
that
the
fishing
vessels
of
the
united
states
have
no
right
to
enter
the
open
ports
of
the
british
possessions
in
north
america
except
for
the
purposes
of
shelter
and
repairing
damages
of
purchasing
wood
and
obtaining
water
that
they
have
no
right
to
enter
at
the
british
customhouses
or
to
trade
there
except
in
the
purchase
of
wood
and
water
and
that
they
must
depart
within
twentyfour
hours
after
notice
to
leave
it
is
not
known
that
any
seizure
of
a
fishing
vessel
carrying
the
flag
of
the
united
states
has
been
made
under
this
claim
so
far
as
the
claim
is
founded
on
an
alleged
construction
of
he
convention
of
it
can
not
be
acquiesced
in
by
the
united
states
it
is
hoped
that
it
will
not
be
insisted
on
by
her
majestys
government
during
the
conferences
which
preceded
the
negotiation
of
the
convention
of
the
british
commissioners
proposed
to
expressly
exclude
the
fishermen
of
the
united
states
from
the
privilege
of
carrying
on
trade
with
any
of
his
britannic
majestys
subjects
residing
within
the
limits
assigned
for
their
use
and
also
that
it
should
not
be
lawful
for
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
engaged
in
said
fishery
to
have
on
board
any
goods
wares
or
merchandise
whatever
except
such
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
prosecution
of
their
voyages
to
and
from
the
said
fishing
grounds
and
any
vessel
of
the
united
states
which
shall
contravene
this
regulation
may
be
seized
condemned
and
confiscated
with
her
cargo
this
proposition
which
is
identical
with
the
construction
now
put
upon
the
language
of
the
convention
was
emphatically
rejected
by
the
american
commissioners
and
thereupon
was
abandoned
by
the
british
plenipotentiaries
and
article
i
as
it
stands
in
the
convention
was
substituted
if
however
it
be
said
that
this
claim
is
founded
on
provincial
or
colonial
statutes
and
not
upon
the
convention
this
government
can
not
but
regard
them
as
unfriendly
and
in
contravention
of
the
spirit
if
not
of
the
letter
of
the
treaty
for
the
faithful
execution
of
which
the
imperial
government
is
alone
responsible
anticipating
that
an
attempt
may
possibly
be
made
by
the
canadian
authorities
in
the
coming
season
to
repeat
their
unneighborly
acts
toward
our
fishermen
i
recommend
you
to
confer
upon
the
executive
the
power
to
suspend
by
proclamation
the
operation
of
the
laws
authorizing
the
transit
of
goods
wares
and
merchandise
in
bond
across
the
territory
of
the
united
states
to
canada
and
further
should
such
an
extreme
measure
become
necessary
to
suspend
the
operation
of
any
laws
whereby
the
vessels
of
the
dominion
of
canada
are
permitted
to
enter
the
waters
of
the
united
states
a
like
unfriendly
disposition
has
been
manifested
on
the
part
of
canada
in
the
maintenance
of
a
claim
of
right
to
exclude
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
from
the
navigation
of
the
st
lawrence
this
river
constitutes
a
natural
outlet
to
the
ocean
for
eight
states
with
an
aggregate
population
of
about
inhabitants
and
with
an
aggregate
tonnage
of
tons
upon
the
waters
which
discharge
into
it
the
foreign
commerce
of
our
ports
on
these
waters
is
open
to
british
competition
and
the
major
part
of
it
is
done
in
british
bottoms
if
the
american
seamen
be
excluded
from
this
natural
avenue
to
the
ocean
the
monopoly
of
the
direct
commerce
of
the
lake
ports
with
the
atlantic
would
be
in
foreign
hands
their
vessels
on
transatlantic
voyages
having
an
access
to
our
lake
ports
which
would
be
denied
to
american
vessels
on
similar
voyages
to
state
such
a
proposition
is
to
refute
its
justice
during
the
administration
of
mr
john
quincy
adams
mr
clay
unanswerably
demonstrated
the
natural
right
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
the
navigation
of
this
river
claiming
that
the
act
of
the
congress
of
vienna
in
opening
the
rhine
and
other
rivers
to
all
nations
showed
the
judgment
of
european
jurists
and
statesmen
that
the
inhabitants
of
a
country
through
which
a
navigable
river
passes
have
a
natural
right
to
enjoy
the
navigation
of
that
river
to
and
into
the
sea
even
though
passing
through
the
territories
of
another
power
this
right
does
not
exclude
the
coequal
right
of
the
sovereign
possessing
the
territory
through
which
the
river
debouches
into
the
sea
to
make
such
regulations
relative
to
the
police
of
the
navigation
as
may
be
reasonably
necessary
but
those
regulations
should
be
framed
in
a
liberal
spirit
of
comity
and
should
not
impose
needless
burdens
upon
the
commerce
which
has
the
right
of
transit
it
has
been
found
in
practice
more
advantageous
to
arrange
these
regulations
by
mutual
agreement
the
united
states
are
ready
to
make
any
reasonable
arrangement
as
to
the
police
of
the
st
lawrence
which
may
be
suggested
by
great
britain
if
the
claim
made
by
mr
clay
was
just
when
the
population
of
states
bordering
on
the
shores
of
the
lakes
was
only
it
now
derives
greater
force
and
equity
from
the
increased
population
wealth
production
and
tonnage
of
the
states
on
the
canadian
frontier
since
mr
clay
advanced
his
argument
in
behalf
of
our
right
the
principle
for
which
he
contended
has
been
frequently
and
by
various
nations
recognized
by
law
or
by
treaty
and
has
been
extended
to
several
other
great
rivers
by
the
treaty
concluded
at
mayence
in
the
rhine
was
declared
free
from
the
point
where
it
is
first
navigable
into
the
sea
by
the
convention
between
spain
and
portugal
concluded
in
the
navigation
of
the
douro
throughout
its
whole
extent
was
made
free
for
the
subjects
of
both
crowns
in
the
argentine
confederation
by
treaty
threw
open
the
free
navigation
of
the
parana
and
the
uruguay
to
the
merchant
vessels
of
all
nations
in
the
crimean
war
was
closed
by
a
treaty
which
provided
for
the
free
navigation
of
the
danube
in
bolivia
by
treaty
declared
that
it
regarded
the
rivers
amazon
and
la
plata
in
accordance
with
fixed
principles
of
national
law
as
highways
or
channels
opened
by
nature
for
the
commerce
of
all
nations
in
the
paraguay
was
made
free
by
treaty
and
in
december
the
emperor
of
brazil
by
imperial
decree
declared
the
amazon
to
be
open
to
the
frontier
of
brazil
to
the
merchant
ships
of
all
nations
the
greatest
living
british
authority
on
this
subject
while
asserting
the
abstract
right
of
the
british
claim
says
it
seems
difficult
to
deny
that
great
britain
may
ground
her
refusal
upon
strict
law
but
it
is
equally
difficult
to
deny
first
that
in
so
doing
she
exercises
harshly
an
extreme
and
hard
law
secondly
that
her
conduct
with
respect
to
the
navigation
of
the
st
lawrence
is
in
glaring
and
discreditable
inconsistency
with
her
conduct
with
respect
to
the
navigation
of
the
mississippi
on
the
ground
that
she
possessed
a
small
domain
in
which
the
mississippi
took
its
rise
she
insisted
on
the
right
to
navigate
the
entire
volume
of
its
waters
on
the
ground
that
she
possesses
both
banks
of
the
st
lawrence
where
it
disembogues
itself
into
the
sea
she
denies
to
the
united
states
the
right
of
navigation
though
about
onehalf
of
the
waters
of
lakes
ontario
erie
huron
and
superior
and
the
whole
of
lake
michigan
through
which
the
river
flows
are
the
property
of
the
united
states
the
whole
nation
is
interested
in
securing
cheap
transportation
from
the
agricul
tural
states
of
the
west
to
the
atlantic
seaboard
to
the
citizens
of
those
states
it
secures
a
greater
return
for
their
labor
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
seaboard
it
affords
cheaper
food
to
the
nation
an
increase
in
the
annual
surplus
of
wealth
it
is
hoped
that
the
government
of
great
britain
will
see
the
justice
of
abandoning
the
narrow
and
inconsistent
claim
to
which
her
canadian
provinces
have
urged
her
adherence
our
depressed
commerce
is
a
subject
to
which
i
called
your
special
attention
at
the
last
session
and
suggested
that
we
will
in
the
future
have
to
look
more
to
the
countries
south
of
us
and
to
china
and
japan
for
its
revival
our
representatives
to
all
these
governments
have
exerted
their
influence
to
encourage
trade
between
the
united
states
and
the
countries
to
which
they
are
accredited
but
the
fact
exists
that
the
carrying
is
done
almost
entirely
in
foreign
bottoms
and
while
this
state
of
affairs
exists
we
can
not
control
our
due
share
of
the
commerce
of
the
world
that
between
the
pacific
states
and
china
and
japan
is
about
all
the
carrying
trade
now
conducted
in
american
vessels
i
would
recommend
a
liberal
policy
toward
that
line
of
american
steamersone
that
will
insure
its
success
and
even
increased
usefulness
the
cost
of
building
iron
vessels
the
only
ones
that
can
compete
with
foreign
ships
in
the
carrying
trade
is
so
much
greater
in
the
united
states
than
in
foreign
countries
that
without
some
assistance
from
the
government
they
can
not
be
successfully
built
here
there
will
be
several
propositions
laid
before
congress
in
the
course
of
the
present
session
looking
to
a
remedy
for
this
evil
even
if
it
should
be
at
some
cost
to
the
national
treasury
i
hope
such
encouragement
will
be
given
as
will
secure
american
shipping
on
the
high
seas
and
american
shipbuilding
at
home
the
condition
of
the
archives
at
the
department
of
state
calls
for
the
early
action
of
congress
the
building
now
rented
by
that
department
is
a
frail
structure
at
an
inconvenient
distance
from
the
executive
mansion
and
from
the
other
departments
is
ill
adapted
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
used
has
not
capacity
to
accommodate
the
archives
and
is
not
fireproof
its
remote
situation
its
slender
construction
and
the
absence
of
a
supply
of
water
in
the
neighborhood
leave
but
little
hope
of
safety
for
either
the
building
or
its
contents
in
case
of
the
accident
of
a
fire
its
destruction
would
involve
the
loss
of
the
rolls
containing
the
original
acts
and
resolutions
of
congress
of
the
historic
records
of
the
revolution
and
of
the
confederation
of
the
whole
series
of
diplomatic
and
consular
archives
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
of
the
many
other
valuable
records
and
papers
left
with
that
department
when
it
was
the
principal
depository
of
the
governmental
archives
i
recommend
an
appropriation
for
the
construction
of
a
building
for
the
department
of
state
i
recommend
to
your
consideration
the
propriety
of
transferring
to
the
department
of
the
interior
to
which
they
seem
more
appropriately
to
belong
all
powers
and
duties
in
relation
to
the
territories
with
which
the
department
of
state
is
now
charged
by
law
or
usage
and
from
the
interior
department
to
the
war
department
the
pension
bureau
so
far
as
it
regulates
the
payment
of
soldiers
pensions
i
would
further
recommend
that
the
payment
of
naval
pensions
be
transferred
to
one
of
the
bureaus
of
the
navy
department
the
estimates
for
the
expenses
of
the
government
for
the
next
fiscal
year
are
less
than
for
the
current
one
but
exceed
the
appropriations
for
the
present
year
for
the
same
items
in
this
estimate
however
is
included
for
public
works
heretofore
begun
under
congressional
provision
and
of
which
only
so
much
is
asked
as
congress
may
choose
to
give
the
appropriation
for
the
same
works
for
the
present
fiscal
year
was
the
average
value
of
gold
as
compared
with
national
currency
for
the
whole
of
the
year
was
about
and
for
eleven
months
of
the
same
relative
value
has
been
about
the
approach
to
a
specie
basis
is
very
gratifying
but
the
fact
can
not
be
denied
that
the
instability
of
the
value
of
our
currency
is
prejudicial
to
our
prosperity
and
tends
to
keep
up
prices
to
the
detriment
of
trade
the
evils
of
a
depreciated
and
fluctuating
currency
are
so
great
that
now
when
the
premium
on
gold
has
fallen
so
much
it
would
seem
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
by
wise
and
prudent
legislation
congress
should
look
to
a
policy
which
would
place
our
currency
at
par
with
gold
at
no
distant
day
the
tax
collected
from
the
people
has
been
reduced
more
than
per
annum
by
steadiness
in
our
present
course
there
is
no
reason
why
in
a
few
short
years
the
national
tax
gatherer
may
not
disappear
from
the
door
of
the
citizen
almost
entirely
with
the
revenue
stamp
dispensed
by
postmasters
in
every
community
a
tax
upon
liquors
of
all
sorts
and
tobacco
in
all
its
forms
and
by
a
wise
adjustment
of
the
tariff
which
will
put
a
duty
only
upon
those
articles
which
we
could
dispense
with
known
as
luxuries
and
on
those
which
we
use
more
of
than
we
produce
revenue
enough
may
be
raised
after
a
few
years
of
peace
and
consequent
reduction
of
indebtedness
to
fulfill
all
our
obligations
a
further
reduction
of
expenses
in
addition
to
a
reduction
of
interest
account
may
be
relied
on
to
make
this
practicable
revenue
reform
if
it
means
this
has
my
hearty
support
if
it
implies
a
collection
of
all
the
revenue
for
the
support
of
the
government
for
the
payment
of
principal
and
interest
of
the
public
debt
pensions
etc
by
directly
taxing
the
people
then
i
am
against
revenue
reform
and
confidently
believe
the
people
are
with
me
if
it
means
failure
to
provide
the
necessary
means
to
defray
all
the
expenses
of
government
and
thereby
repudiation
of
the
public
debt
and
pensions
then
i
am
still
more
opposed
to
such
kind
of
revenue
reform
revenue
reform
has
not
been
defined
by
any
of
its
advocates
to
my
knowledge
but
seems
to
be
accepted
as
something
which
is
to
supply
every
mans
wants
without
any
cost
or
effort
on
his
part
a
true
revenue
reform
can
not
be
made
in
a
day
but
must
be
the
work
of
national
legislation
and
of
time
as
soon
as
the
revenue
can
be
dispensed
with
all
duty
should
be
removed
from
coffee
tea
and
other
articles
of
universal
use
not
produced
by
ourselves
the
necessities
of
the
country
compel
us
to
collect
revenue
from
our
imports
an
army
of
assessors
and
collectors
is
not
a
pleasant
sight
to
the
citizen
but
that
of
a
tariff
for
revenue
is
necessary
such
a
tariff
so
far
as
it
acts
as
an
encouragement
to
home
production
affords
employment
to
labor
at
living
wages
in
contrast
to
the
pauper
labor
of
the
old
world
and
also
in
the
development
of
home
resources
under
the
act
of
congress
of
the
th
day
of
july
the
army
has
gradually
been
reduced
so
that
on
the
st
day
of
january
the
number
of
commissioned
officers
and
men
will
not
exceed
the
number
contemplated
by
that
law
the
war
department
building
is
an
old
structure
not
fireproof
and
entirely
inadequate
in
dimensions
to
our
present
wants
many
thousands
of
dollars
are
now
paid
annually
for
rent
of
private
buildings
to
accommodate
the
various
bureaus
of
the
department
i
recommend
an
appropriation
for
a
new
war
department
building
suited
to
the
present
and
growing
wants
of
the
nation
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
shows
a
very
satisfactory
reduction
in
the
expenses
of
the
army
for
the
last
fiscal
year
for
details
you
are
referred
to
his
accompanying
report
the
expenses
of
the
navy
for
the
whole
of
the
last
yearie
from
december
the
date
of
the
last
reportare
less
than
or
about
less
than
they
were
the
previous
year
the
expenses
since
the
commencement
of
this
fiscal
yearie
since
july
show
for
the
five
months
a
decrease
of
over
from
those
of
the
corresponding
months
last
year
the
estimates
for
the
current
year
were
those
for
next
year
are
with
additional
for
necessary
permanent
improvements
these
estimates
are
made
closely
for
the
mere
maintenance
of
the
naval
establishment
as
now
is
without
much
in
the
nature
of
permanent
improvement
the
appropriations
made
for
the
last
and
current
years
were
evidently
intended
by
congress
and
are
sufficient
only
to
keep
the
navy
on
its
present
footing
by
the
repairing
and
refitting
of
our
old
ships
this
policy
must
of
course
gradually
but
surely
destroy
the
navy
and
it
is
in
itself
far
from
economical
as
each
year
that
it
is
pursued
the
necessity
for
mere
repairs
in
ships
and
navyyards
becomes
more
imperative
and
more
costly
and
our
current
expenses
are
annually
increased
for
the
mere
repair
of
ships
many
of
which
must
soon
become
unsafe
and
useless
i
hope
during
the
present
session
of
congress
to
be
able
to
submit
to
it
a
plan
by
which
naval
vessels
can
be
built
and
repairs
made
with
great
saving
upon
the
present
cost
it
can
hardly
be
wise
statesmanship
in
a
government
which
represents
a
country
with
over
miles
of
coast
line
on
both
oceans
exclusive
of
alaska
and
containing
progressive
people
with
relations
of
every
nature
with
almost
every
foreign
country
to
rest
with
such
inadequate
means
of
enforcing
any
foreign
policy
either
of
protection
or
redress
separated
by
the
ocean
from
the
nations
of
the
eastern
continent
our
navy
is
our
only
means
of
direct
protection
to
our
citizens
abroad
or
for
the
enforcement
of
any
foreign
policy
the
accompanying
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
shows
a
most
satisfactory
working
of
that
department
with
the
adoption
of
the
recommendations
contained
therein
particularly
those
relating
to
a
reform
in
the
franking
privilege
and
the
adoption
of
the
correspondence
cards
a
selfsustaining
postal
system
may
speedily
be
looked
for
and
at
no
distant
day
a
further
reduction
of
the
rate
of
postage
be
attained
i
recommend
authorization
by
congress
to
the
postmastergeneral
and
attorneygeneral
to
issue
all
commissions
to
officials
appointed
through
their
respective
departments
at
present
these
commissions
where
appointments
are
presidential
are
issued
by
the
state
department
the
law
in
all
the
departments
of
government
exc
ept
those
of
the
postoffice
and
of
justice
authorizes
each
to
issue
its
own
commissions
always
favoring
practical
reforms
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
one
abuse
of
long
standing
which
i
would
like
to
see
remedied
by
this
congress
it
is
a
reform
in
the
civil
service
of
the
country
i
would
have
it
go
beyond
the
mere
fixing
of
the
tenure
of
office
of
clerks
and
employees
who
do
not
require
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
to
make
their
appointments
complete
i
would
have
it
govern
not
the
tenure
but
the
manner
of
making
all
appointments
there
is
no
duty
which
so
much
embarrasses
the
executive
and
heads
of
departments
as
that
of
appointments
nor
is
there
any
such
arduous
and
thankless
labor
imposed
on
senators
and
representatives
as
that
of
finding
places
for
constituents
the
present
system
does
not
secure
the
best
men
and
often
not
even
fit
men
for
public
place
the
elevation
and
purification
of
the
civil
service
of
the
government
will
be
hailed
with
approval
by
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
reform
in
the
management
of
indian
affairs
has
received
the
special
attention
of
the
administration
from
its
inauguration
to
the
present
day
the
experiment
of
making
it
a
missionary
work
was
tried
with
a
few
agencies
given
to
the
denomination
of
friends
and
has
been
found
to
work
most
advantageously
all
agencies
and
superintendencies
not
so
disposed
of
were
given
to
officers
of
the
army
the
act
of
congress
reducing
the
army
renders
army
officers
ineligible
for
civil
positions
indian
agencies
being
civil
offices
i
determined
to
give
all
the
agencies
to
such
religious
denominations
as
had
heretofore
established
missionaries
among
the
indians
and
perhaps
to
some
other
denominations
who
would
undertake
the
work
on
the
same
termsie
as
a
missionary
work
the
societies
selected
are
allowed
to
name
their
own
agents
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
executive
and
are
expected
to
watch
over
them
and
aid
them
as
missionaries
to
christianize
and
civilize
the
indian
and
to
train
him
in
the
arts
of
peace
the
government
watches
over
the
official
acts
of
these
agents
and
requires
of
them
as
strict
an
accountability
as
if
they
were
appointed
in
any
other
manner
i
entertain
the
confident
hope
that
the
policy
now
pursued
will
in
a
few
years
bring
all
the
indians
upon
reservations
where
they
will
live
in
houses
and
have
schoolhouses
and
churches
and
will
be
pursuing
peaceful
and
selfsustaining
avocations
and
where
they
may
be
visited
by
the
lawabiding
white
man
with
the
same
impunity
that
he
now
visits
the
civilized
white
settlements
i
call
your
special
attention
to
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
for
full
information
on
this
subject
during
the
last
fiscal
year
acres
of
public
land
were
disposed
of
of
this
quantity
acres
were
taken
under
the
homestead
law
and
acres
sold
for
cash
the
remainder
was
located
with
military
warrants
college
or
indian
scrip
or
applied
in
satisfaction
of
grants
to
railroads
or
for
other
public
uses
the
entries
under
the
homestead
law
during
the
last
year
covered
acres
more
than
those
during
the
preceding
year
surveys
have
been
vigorously
prosecuted
to
the
full
extent
of
the
means
applicable
to
the
purpose
the
quantity
of
land
in
market
will
amply
supply
the
present
demand
the
claim
of
the
settler
under
the
homestead
or
the
preemption
laws
is
not
however
limited
to
lands
subject
to
sale
at
private
entry
any
unappropriated
surveyed
public
land
may
to
a
limited
amount
be
acquired
under
the
former
laws
if
the
party
entitled
to
enter
under
them
will
comply
with
the
requirements
they
prescribe
in
regard
to
the
residence
and
cultivation
the
actual
settlers
preference
right
of
purchase
is
even
broader
and
extends
to
lands
which
were
unsurveyed
at
the
time
of
his
settlement
his
right
was
formerly
confined
within
much
narrower
limits
and
at
one
period
of
our
history
was
conferred
only
by
special
statutes
they
were
enacted
from
time
to
time
to
legalize
what
was
then
regarded
as
an
unauthorized
intrusion
upon
the
national
domain
the
opinion
that
the
public
lands
should
be
regarded
chiefly
as
a
source
of
revenue
is
no
longer
maintained
the
rapid
settlement
and
successful
cultivation
of
them
are
now
justly
considered
of
more
importance
to
our
wellbeing
than
is
the
fund
which
the
sale
of
them
would
produce
the
remarkable
growth
and
prosperity
of
our
new
states
and
territories
attest
the
wisdom
of
the
legislation
which
invites
the
tiller
of
the
soil
to
secure
a
permanent
home
on
terms
within
the
reach
of
all
the
pioneer
who
incurs
the
dangers
and
privations
of
a
frontier
life
and
thus
aids
in
laying
the
foundation
of
new
commonwealths
renders
a
signal
service
to
his
country
and
is
entitled
to
its
special
favor
and
protection
these
laws
secure
that
object
and
largely
promote
the
general
welfare
they
should
therefore
be
cherished
as
a
permanent
feature
of
our
land
system
good
faith
requires
us
to
give
full
effect
to
existing
grants
the
timehonored
and
beneficent
policy
of
setting
apart
certain
sections
of
public
land
for
educational
purposes
in
the
new
states
should
be
continued
when
ample
provision
shall
have
been
made
for
these
objects
i
submit
as
a
question
worthy
of
serious
consideration
whether
the
residue
of
our
national
domain
should
not
be
wholly
disposed
of
under
the
provisions
the
homestead
and
preemption
laws
in
addition
to
the
swamp
and
overflowed
lands
granted
to
the
states
in
which
they
are
situated
the
lands
taken
under
the
agriculturalcollege
acts
and
for
internalimprovement
purposes
under
the
act
of
september
and
the
acts
supplemental
thereto
there
had
been
conveyed
up
to
the
close
of
the
last
fiscal
year
by
patent
or
other
equivalent
title
to
states
and
corporations
acres
for
railways
canals
and
wagon
roads
it
is
estimated
that
an
additional
quantity
of
acres
is
still
due
under
grants
for
like
uses
the
policy
of
thus
aiding
the
states
in
building
works
of
internal
improvement
was
inaugurated
more
than
forty
years
since
in
the
grants
to
indiana
and
illinois
to
aid
those
states
in
opening
canals
to
connect
the
waters
of
the
wabash
with
those
of
lake
erie
and
the
waters
of
the
illinois
with
those
of
lake
michigan
it
was
followed
with
some
modifications
in
the
grant
to
illinois
of
alternate
sections
of
public
land
within
certain
limits
of
the
illinois
central
railway
fourteen
states
and
sundry
corporations
have
received
similar
subsidies
in
connection
with
railways
completed
or
in
process
of
construction
as
the
reserved
sections
are
rated
at
the
double
minimum
the
sale
of
them
at
the
enhanced
price
has
thus
in
many
instances
indemnified
the
treasury
for
the
granted
lands
the
construction
of
some
of
these
thoroughfares
has
undoubtedly
given
a
vigorous
impulse
to
the
development
of
our
resources
and
the
settlement
of
the
more
distant
portions
of
the
country
it
may
however
be
well
insisted
that
much
of
our
legislation
in
this
regard
has
been
characterized
by
indiscriminate
and
profuse
liberality
the
united
states
should
not
loan
their
credit
in
aid
of
any
enterprise
undertaken
by
states
or
corporations
nor
grant
lands
in
any
instance
unless
the
projected
work
is
of
acknowledged
national
importance
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
it
is
inexpedient
and
unnecessary
to
bestow
subsidies
of
either
description
but
should
congress
determine
otherwise
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
right
of
settlers
and
of
the
public
be
more
effectually
secured
and
protected
by
appropriate
legislation
during
the
year
ending
september
there
were
filed
in
the
patent
office
applications
for
patents
caveats
and
applications
for
the
extension
of
patents
thirteen
thousand
six
hundred
and
twentytwo
patents
including
reissues
and
designs
were
issued
extended
and
allowed
but
not
issued
by
reason
of
the
nonpayment
of
the
final
fees
the
receipts
of
the
office
during
the
year
were
in
excess
of
its
expenditures
the
work
of
the
census
bureau
has
been
energetically
prosecuted
the
preliminary
report
containing
much
information
of
special
value
and
interest
will
be
ready
for
delivery
during
the
present
session
the
remaining
volumes
will
be
completed
with
all
the
dispatch
consistent
with
perfect
accuracy
in
arranging
and
classifying
the
returns
we
shall
thus
at
no
distant
day
be
furnished
with
an
authentic
record
of
our
condition
and
resources
it
will
i
doubt
not
attest
the
growing
prosperity
of
the
country
although
during
the
decade
which
has
just
closed
it
was
so
severely
tried
by
the
great
war
waged
to
maintain
its
integrity
and
to
secure
and
perpetuate
our
free
institutions
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
sum
paid
to
pensioners
including
the
cost
of
disbursement
was
and
bountyland
warrants
were
issued
at
its
close
names
were
on
the
pension
rolls
the
labors
of
the
pension
office
have
been
directed
to
the
severe
scrutiny
of
the
evidence
submitted
in
favor
of
new
claims
and
to
the
discovery
of
fictitious
claims
which
have
been
heretofore
allowed
the
appropriation
for
the
employment
of
special
agents
for
the
investigation
of
frauds
has
been
judiciously
used
and
the
results
obtained
have
been
of
unquestionable
benefit
to
the
service
the
subjects
of
education
and
agriculture
are
of
great
interest
to
the
success
of
our
republican
institutions
happiness
and
grandeur
as
a
nation
in
the
interest
of
one
a
bureau
has
been
established
in
the
interior
departmentthe
bureau
of
education
and
in
the
interest
of
the
other
a
separate
department
that
of
agriculture
i
believe
great
general
good
is
to
flow
from
the
operations
of
both
these
bureaus
if
properly
fostered
i
can
not
commend
to
your
careful
consideration
too
highly
the
reports
of
the
commissioners
of
education
and
of
agriculture
nor
urge
too
strongly
such
liberal
legislation
as
to
secure
their
efficiency
in
conclusion
i
would
sum
up
the
policy
of
the
administration
to
be
a
thorough
enforcement
of
every
law
a
faithful
collection
of
every
tax
provided
for
economy
in
the
disbursement
of
the
same
a
prompt
payment
of
every
debt
of
the
nation
a
reduction
of
taxes
as
rapidly
as
the
requirem
ents
of
the
country
will
admit
reductions
of
taxation
and
tariff
to
be
so
arranged
as
to
afford
the
greatest
relief
to
the
greatest
number
honest
and
fair
dealings
with
all
other
peoples
to
the
end
that
war
with
all
its
blighting
consequences
may
be
avoided
but
without
surrendering
any
right
or
obligation
due
to
us
a
reform
in
the
treatment
of
indians
and
in
the
whole
civil
service
of
the
country
and
finally
in
securing
a
pure
untrammeled
ballot
where
every
man
entitled
to
cast
a
vote
may
do
so
just
once
at
each
election
without

or
proscription

gratitude
to

enjoy
we

return

our

i
earnestly
desire
that
neither
you
nor
i
may
be
condemned
by
a
free
and
enlightened
constituency
nor
by

emerging
from

of
gigantic
magnitude
aided
as
it
was
by
the
sympathies
and
assistance
of
nations
with
which
we
were
at

eleven
states
of

were
four
years

left
without

a
national
debt
had
been

american
commerce
was
almost
driven
from
the

the
industry
of
onehalf
of
the
country
had
been
taken
from
the
control
of
the
capitalist
and
placed
where
all

rightfully
belongsin
the
keeping
of

the
work
of
restoring

loyal
to
the

of
protecting
and
fostering

and
providing

has
received
ample
attention
from
congress
although
your
efforts
have
not
met
with
the
success
in
all
particulars
that
might
have
been
desired
yet
on
the
whole
they
have
been
more
successful
than
could
have
been
reasonably
anticipated
seven
states
which
passed
ordinances
of
secession
have
been
fully
restored
to
their
places
in

the
eighth
georgia
held
an
election
at
which
she
ratified
her
constitution
republican
in
form
elected
a
governor
members
of
congress
a
state
legislature
and
all
other
officers
required
the
governor
was
duly
installed
and
the
legislature
met
and
performed
all
the
acts
then
required
of
them
by
the
reconstruction
acts
of
congress
subsequently
however
in
violation
of
the
constitution
which
they
had
just
ratified
as
since
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
they
unseated
the
colored
members
of
the
legislature
and
admitted
to
seats
some
members
who
are
disqualified
by
the
third
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitutionan
article
which
they
themselves
had
contributed
to
ratify
under
these
circumstances
i
would
submit
to
you
whether
it
would
not
be
wise
without
delay
to
enact
a
law
authorizing
the
governor
of
georgia
to
convene
the
members
originally
elected
to
the
legislature
requiring
each
member
to
take
the
oath
prescribed
by
the
reconstruction
acts
and
none
to
be
admitted
who
are
ineligible
under
the
third
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
freedmen
under
the
protection
which
they
have
received
are
making
rapid
progress
in
learning
and
no
complaints
are
heard
of
lack
of
industry
on
their
part
where
they
receive
fair
remuneration
for
their
labor
the
means
provided
for
paying
the
interest
on
the
public
debt
with
all
other
expenses
of
government
are
more
than
ample
the
loss
of
our
commerce
is
the
only
result
of
the
late
rebellion
which
has
not
received
sufficient
attention
from
you
to
this
subject
i
call
your
earnest
attention
i
will
not
now
suggest
plans
by
which
this
object
may
be
effected
but
will
if
necessary
make
it
the
subject
of
a
special
message
during
the
session
of
congress
at
the
march
term
congress
by
joint
resolution
authorized
the
executive
to
order
elections
in
the
states
of
virginia
mississippi
and
texas
to
submit
to
them
the
constitutions
which
each
had
previously
in
convention
framed
and
submit
the
constitutions
either
entire
or
in
separate
parts
to
be
voted
upon
at
the
discretion
of
the
executive
under
this
authority
elections
were
called
in
virginia
the
election
took
place
on
the
th
of
july
the
governor
and
lieutenantgovernor
elected
have
been
installed
the
legislature
met
and
did
all
required
by
this
resolution
and
by
all
the
reconstruction
acts
of
congress
and
abstained
from
all
doubtful
authority
i
recommend
that
her
senators
and
representatives
be
promptly
admitted
to
their
seats
and
that
the
state
be
fully
restored
to
its
place
in
the
family
of
states
elections
were
called
in
mississippi
and
texas
to
commence
on
the
th
of
november
and
to
last
two
days
in
mississippi
and
four
days
in
texas
the
elections
have
taken
place
but
the
result
is
not
known
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
acts
of
the
legislatures
of
these
states
when
they
meet
will
be
such
as
to
receive
your
approval
and
thus
close
the
work
of
reconstruction
among
the
evils
growing
out
of
the
rebellion
and
not
yet
referred
to
is
that
of
an
irredeemable
currency
it
is
an
evil
which
i
hope
will
receive
your
most
earnest
attention
it
is
a
duty
and
one
of
the
highest
duties
of
government
to
secure
to
the
citizen
a
medium
of
exchange
of
fixed
unvarying
value
this
implies
a
return
to
a
specie
basis
and
no
substitute
for
it
can
be
devised
it
should
be
commenced
now
and
reached
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
consistent
with
a
fair
regard
to
the
interests
of
the
debtor
class
immediate
resumption
if
practicable
would
not
be
desirable
it
would
compel
the
debtor
class
to
pay
beyond
their
contracts
the
premium
on
gold
at
the
date
of
their
purchase
and
would
bring
bankruptcy
and
ruin
to
thousands
fluctuation
however
in
the
paper
value
of
the
measure
of
all
values
gold
is
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
trade
it
makes
the
man
of
business
an
involuntary
gambler
for
in
all
sales
where
future
payment
is
to
be
made
both
parties
speculate
as
to
what
will
be
the
value
of
the
currency
to
be
paid
and
received
i
earnestly
recommend
to
you
then
such
legislation
as
will
insure
a
gradual
return
to
specie
payments
and
put
an
immediate
stop
to
fluctuations
in
the
value
of
currency
the
methods
to
secure
the
former
of
these
results
are
as
numerous
as
are
the
speculators
on
political
economy
to
secure
the
latter
i
see
but
one
way
and
that
is
to
authorize
the
treasury
to
redeem
its
own
paper
at
a
fixed
price
whenever
presented
and
to
withhold
from
circulation
all
currency
so
redeemed
until
sold
again
for
gold
the
vast
resources
of
the
nation
both
developed
and
undeveloped
ought
to
make
our
credit
the
best
on
earth
with
a
less
burden
of
taxation
than
the
citizen
has
endured
for
six
years
past
the
entire
public
debt
could
be
paid
in
ten
years
but
it
is
not
desirable
that
the
people
should
be
taxed
to
pay
it
in
that
time
year
by
year
the
ability
to
pay
increases
in
a
rapid
ratio
but
the
burden
of
interest
ought
to
be
reduced
as
rapidly
as
can
be
done
without
the
violation
of
contract
the
public
debt
is
represented
in
great
part
by
bonds
having
from
five
to
twenty
and
from
ten
to
forty
years
to
run
bearing
interest
at
the
rate
of
per
cent
and
per
cent
respectively
it
is
optional
with
the
government
to
pay
these
bonds
at
any
period
after
the
expiration
of
the
least
time
mentioned
upon
their
face
the
time
has
already
expired
when
a
great
part
of
them
may
be
taken
up
and
is
rapidly
approaching
when
all
may
be
it
is
believed
that
all
which
are
now
due
may
be
replaced
by
bonds
bearing
a
rate
of
interest
not
exceeding
per
cent
and
as
rapidly
as
the
remainder
become
due
that
they
may
be
replaced
in
the
same
way
to
accomplish
this
it
may
be
necessary
to
authorize
the
interest
to
be
paid
at
either
of
three
or
four
of
the
money
centers
of
europe
or
by
any
assistant
treasurer
of
the
united
states
at
the
option
of
the
holder
of
the
bond
i
suggest
this
subject
for
the
consideration
of
congress
and
also
simultaneously
with
this
the
propriety
of
redeeming
our
currency
as
before
suggested
at
its
market
value
at
the
time
the
law
goes
into
effect
increasing
the
rate
at
which
currency
shall
be
bought
and
sold
from
day
to
day
or
week
to
week
at
the
same
rate
of
interest
as
government
pays
upon
its
bonds
the
subjects
of
tariff
and
internal
taxation
will
necessarily
receive
your
attention
the
revenues
of
the
country
are
greater
than
the
requirements
and
may
with
safety
be
reduced
but
as
the
funding
of
the
debt
in
a
or
a
per
cent
loan
would
reduce
annual
current
expenses
largely
thus
after
funding
justifying
a
greater
reduction
of
taxation
than
would
be
now
expedient
i
suggest
postponement
of
this
question
until
the
next
meeting
of
congress
it
may
be
advisable
to
modify
taxation
and
tariff
in
instances
where
unjust
or
burdensome
discriminations
are
made
by
the
present
laws
but
a
general
revision
of
the
laws
regulating
this
subject
i
recommend
the
postponement
of
for
the
present
i
also
suggest
the
renewal
of
the
tax
on
incomes
but
at
a
reduced
rate
say
of
per
cent
and
this
tax
to
expire
in
three
years
with
the
funding
of
the
national
debt
as
here
suggested
i
feel
safe
in
saying
that
taxes
and
the
revenue
from
imports
may
be
reduced
safely
from
sixty
to
eighty
millions
per
annum
at
once
and
may
be
still
further
reduced
from
year
to
year
as
the
resources
of
the
country
are
developed
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shows
the
receipts
of
the
government
for
the
fiscal
year
endin
g
june
to
be
and
the
expenditures
including
interest
bounties
etc
to
be
the
estimates
for
the
ensuing
year
are
more
favorable
to
the
government
and
will
no
doubt
show
a
much
larger
decrease
of
the
public
debt
the
receipts
in
the
treasury
beyond
expenditures
have
exceeded
the
amount
necessary
to
place
to
the
credit
of
the
sinking
fund
as
provided
by
law
to
lock
up
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
and
withhold
it
from
circulation
would
lead
to
such
a
contraction
of
the
currency
as
to
cripple
trade
and
seriously
affect
the
prosperity
of
the
country
under
these
circumstances
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
myself
heartily
concurred
in
the
propriety
of
using
all
the
surplus
currency
in
the
treasury
in
the
purchase
of
government
bonds
thus
reducing
the
interestbearing
indebtedness
of
the
country
and
of
submitting
to
congress
the
question
of
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
bonds
so
purchased
the
bonds
now
held
by
the
treasury
amount
to
about
seventyfive
millions
including
those
belonging
to
the
sinking
fund
i
recommend
that
the
whole
be
placed
to
the
credit
of
the
sinking
fund
your
attention
is
respectfully
invited
to
the
recommendations
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
the
creation
of
the
office
of
commissioner
of
customs
revenue
for
the
increase
of
salaries
to
certain
classes
of
officials
the
substitution
of
increased
nationalbank
circulation
to
replace
the
outstanding
per
cent
certificates
and
most
especially
to
his
recommendation
for
the
repeal
of
laws
allowing
shares
of
fines
penalties
forfeitures
etc
to
officers
of
the
government
or
to
informers
the
office
of
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
is
one
of
the
most
arduous
and
responsible
under
the
government
it
falls
but
little
if
any
short
of
a
cabinet
position
in
its
importance
and
responsibilities
i
would
ask
for
it
therefore
such
legislation
as
in
your
judgment
will
place
the
office
upon
a
footing
of
dignity
commensurate
with
its
importance
and
with
the
character
and
qualifications
of
the
class
of
men
required
to
fill
it
properly
as
the
united
states
is
the
freest
of
all
nations
so
too
its
people
sympathize
with
all
people
struggling
for
liberty
and
selfgovernment
but
while
so
sympathizing
it
is
due
to
our
honor
that
we
should
abstain
from
enforcing
our
views
upon
unwilling
nations
and
from
taking
an
interested
part
without
invitation
in
the
quarrels
between
different
nations
or
between
governments
and
their
subjects
our
course
should
always
be
in
conformity
with
strict
justice
and
law
international
and
local
such
has
been
the
policy
of
the
administration
in
dealing
with
these
questions
for
more
than
a
year
a
valuable
province
of
spain
and
a
near
neighbor
of
ours
in
whom
all
our
people
can
not
but
feel
a
deep
interest
has
been
struggling
for
independence
and
freedom
the
people
and
government
of
the
united
states
entertain
the
same
warm
feelings
and
sympathies
for
the
people
of
cuba
in
their
pending
struggle
that
they
manifested
throughout
the
previous
struggles
between
spain
and
her
former
colonies
in
behalf
of
the
latter
but
the
contest
has
at
no
time
assumed
the
conditions
which
amount
to
a
war
in
the
sense
of
international
law
or
which
would
show
the
existence
of
a
de
facto
political
organization
of
the
insurgents
sufficient
to
justify
a
recognition
of
belligerency
the
principle
is
maintained
however
that
this
nation
is
its
own
judge
when
to
accord
the
rights
of
belligerency
either
to
a
people
struggling
to
free
themselves
from
a
government
they
believe
to
be
oppressive
or
to
independent
nations
at
war
with
each
other
the
united
states
have
no
disposition
to
interfere
with
the
existing
relations
of
spain
to
her
colonial
possessions
on
this
continent
they
believe
that
in
due
time
spain
and
other
european
powers
will
find
their
interest
in
terminating
those
relations
and
establishing
their
present
dependencies
as
independent
powersmembers
of
the
family
of
nations
these
dependencies
are
no
longer
regarded
as
subject
to
transfer
from
one
european
power
to
another
when
the
present
relation
of
colonies
ceases
they
are
to
become
independent
powers
exercising
the
right
of
choice
and
of
selfcontrol
in
the
determination
of
their
future
condition
and
relations
with
other
powers
the
united
states
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
bloodshed
in
cuba
and
in
the
interest
of
a
neighboring
people
proposed
their
good
offices
to
bring
the
existing
contest
to
a
termination
the
offer
not
being
accepted
by
spain
on
a
basis
which
we
believed
could
be
received
by
cuba
was
withdrawn
it
is
hoped
that
the
good
offices
of
the
united
states
may
yet
prove
advantageous
for
the
settlement
of
this
unhappy
strife
meanwhile
a
number
of
illegal
expeditions
against
cuba
have
been
broken
up
it
has
been
the
endeavor
of
the
administration
to
execute
the
neutrality
laws
in
good
faith
no
matter
how
unpleasant
the
task
made
so
by
the
sufferings
we
have
endured
from
lack
of
like
good
faith
toward
us
by
other
nations
on
the
th
of
march
last
the
united
states
schooner
lizzie
major
was
arrested
on
the
high
seas
by
a
spanish
frigate
and
two
passengers
taken
from
it
and
carried
as
prisoners
to
cuba
representations
of
these
facts
were
made
to
the
spanish
government
as
soon
as
official
information
of
them
reached
washington
the
two
passengers
were
set
at
liberty
and
the
spanish
government
assured
the
united
states
that
the
captain
of
the
frigate
in
making
the
capture
had
acted
without
law
that
he
had
been
reprimanded
for
the
irregularity
of
his
conduct
and
that
the
spanish
authorities
in
cuba
would
not
sanction
any
act
that
could
violate
the
rights
or
treat
with
disrespect
the
sovereignty
of
this
nation
the
question
of
the
seizure
of
the
brig
mary
lowell
at
one
of
the
bahama
islands
by
spanish
authorities
is
now
the
subject
of
correspondence
between
this
government
and
those
of
spain
and
great
britain
the
captaingeneral
of
cuba
about
may
last
issued
a
proclamation
authorizing
search
to
be
made
of
vessels
on
the
high
seas
immediate
remonstrance
was
made
against
this
whereupon
the
captaingeneral
issued
a
new
proclamation
limiting
the
right
of
search
to
vessels
of
the
united
states
so
far
as
authorized
under
the
treaty
of
this
proclamation
however
was
immediately
withdrawn
i
have
always
felt
that
the
most
intimate
relations
should
be
cultivated
between
the
republic
of
the
united
states
and
all
independent
nations
on
this
continent
it
may
be
well
worth
considering
whether
new
treaties
between
us
and
them
may
not
be
profitably
entered
into
to
secure
more
intimate
relationsfriendly
commercial
and
otherwise
the
subject
of
an
interoceanic
canal
to
connect
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
through
the
isthmus
of
darien
is
one
in
which
commerce
is
greatly
interested
instructions
have
been
given
to
our
minister
to
the
republic
of
the
united
states
of
colombia
to
endeavor
to
obtain
authority
for
a
survey
by
this

determine
the
practicability
of
such
an
undertaking

a
charter
for
the
right
of

to
build
by
private
enterprise
such
a
work
if
the
survey
proves
it
to
be
practicable
in

to
comply
with
the
agreement
of
the
united
states
as
to
a
mixed
commission
at
lima
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
it
became
necessary
to
send
a
commissioner
and
secretary
to
lima
in
august
last
no
appropriation
having
been
made
by
congress
for
this
purpose
it
is
now
asked
that

be
made
covering
the

and
future
expenses
of
the

of
the
united

to
bring
about
a
peace
between
spain
and
the
south
american
republics
with
which
she
is
at
war
having
been
accepted
by
spain
peru
and
chile
a
congress
has
been
invited
to
be
held
in
washington
during
the
present
winter
a
grant
has
been
given
to
europeans
of
an
exclusive
right
of
transit
over
the

of
nicaragua
to
which
costa
rico
has
given
its
assent
which
it
is
alleged
conflicts
with
vested
rights
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
the
department
of
state
has
now
this
subject
under
consideration
the
minister
of
peru
having
made
representations
that
there
was
a
state
of
war
between
peru
and
spain
and
that
spain
was
constructing
in
and
near
new
york
thirty
gunboats
which
might
be
used
by
spain
in
such
a
way
as
to
relieve
the
naval
force
at
cuba
so
as
to
operate
against
peru
orders
were
given
to
prevent
their
departure
no
further
steps
having
been
taken
by
the
representative
of
the
peruvian
government
to
prevent
the
departure
of
these
vessels
and
i
not
feeling
authorized
to
detain
the
property
of
a
nation
with
which
we
are
at
peace
on
a
mere
executive
order
the
matter
has
been
referred
to
the
courts
to
decide
the
conduct
of
the
war
between
the
allies
and
the
republic
of
paraguay
has
made
the
intercourse
with
that
country
so
difficult
that
it
has
been
deemed
advisable
to
withdraw
our
representative
from
there
toward
the
close
of
the
last
administration
a
convention
was
signed
at
london
for
the
settlement
of
all
outstanding
claims
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
which
failed
to
receive
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
to
its
ratification
the
time
and
the
circumstances
attending
the
negotiation
of
that
treaty
were
unfavorable
to
its
acceptance
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
its
provisions
were
wholly
inadequate
for
the
settlement
of
the
grave
wrongs
that
had
been
sustained
by
this
government
as
well
as
by
its
citizens
the
injuries
resulting
to
the
united
states
by
reason
of
the
course
adopted
by
great
britain
during
our
late
civil
warin
the
increased
rates
of
insurance
in
the
diminution
of
exports
and
imports
and
other
obstructions
to
domestic
industry
and
production
in
its
effect
upon
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
country
in
the
decrease
and
transfer
to
great
britain
of
our
commercial
marine
in
the
prolongation
of
the
war
and
the
increased
cost
both
in
treasure
and
in
lives
of
its
suppression
could
not
be
adjusted
and
satisfied
as
ordinary
commercial
claims
which
continually
arise
between
commercial
nations
and
yet
the
convention
treated
them
simply
as
such
ordinary
claims
from
which
they
differ
more
widely
in
the
gravi
ty
of
their
character
than
in
the
magnitude
of
their
amount
great
even
as
is
that
difference
not
a
word
was
found
in
the
treaty
and
not
an
inference
could
be
drawn
from
it
to
remove
the
sense
of
the
unfriendliness
of
the
course
of
great
britain
in
our
struggle
for
existence
which
had
so
deeply
and
universally
impressed
itself
upon
the
people
of
this
country
believing
that
a
convention
thus
misconceived
in
its
scope
and
inadequate
in
its
provisions
would
not
have
produced
the
hearty
cordial
settlement
of
pending
questions
which
alone
is
consistent
with
the
relations
which
i
desire
to
have
firmly
established
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
i
regarded
the
action
of
the
senate
in
rejecting
the
treaty
to
have
been
wisely
taken
in
the
interest
of
peace
and
as
a
necessary
step
in
the
direction
of
a
perfect
and
cordial
friendship
between
the
two
countries
a
sensitive
people
conscious
of
their
power
are
more
at
ease
under
a
great
wrong
wholly
unatoned
than
under
the
restraint
of
a
settlement
which
satisfies
neither
their
ideas
of
justice
nor
their
grave
sense
of
the
grievance
they
have
sustained
the
rejection
of
the
treaty
was
followed
by
a
state
of
public
feeling
on
both
sides
which
i
thought
not
favorable
to
an
immediate
attempt
at
renewed
negotiations
i
accordingly
so
instructed
the
minister
of
the
united
states
to
great
britain
and
found
that
my
views
in
this
regard
were
shared
by
her
majestys
ministers
i
hope
that
the
time
may
soon
arrive
when
the
two
governments
can
approach
the
solution
of
this
momentous
question
with
an
appreciation
of
what
is
due
to
the
rights
dignity
and
honor
of
each
and
with
the
determination
not
only
to
remove
the
causes
of
complaint
in
the
past
but
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
broad
principle
of
public
law
which
will
prevent
future
differences
and
tend
to
firm
and
continued
peace
and
friendship
this
is
now
the
only
grave
question
which
the
united
states
has
with
any
foreign
nation
the
question
of
renewing
a
treaty
for
reciprocal
trade
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
provinces
on
this
continent
has
not
been
favorably
considered
by
the
administration
the
advantages
of
such
a
treaty
would
be
wholly
in
favor
of
the
british
producer
except
possibly
a
few
engaged
in
the
trade
between
the
two
sections
no
citizen
of
the
united
states
would
be
benefited
by
reciprocity
our
internal
taxation
would
prove
a
protection
to
the
british
producer
almost
equal
to
the
protection
which
our
manufacturers
now
receive
from
the
tariff
some
arrangement
however
for
the
regulation
of
commercial
intercourse
between
the
united
states
and
the
dominion
of
canada
may
be
desirable
the
commission
for
adjusting
the
claims
of
the
hudsons
bay
and
puget
sound
agricultural
company
upon
the
united
states
has
terminated
its
labors
the
award
of
has
been
made
and
all
rights
and
titles
of
the
company
on
the
territory
of
the
united
states
have
been
extinguished
deeds
for
the
property
of
the
company
have
been
delivered
an
appropriation
by
congress
to
meet
this
sum
is
asked
the
commissioners
for
determining
the
northwestern
land
boundary
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
possessions
under
the
treaty
of
have
completed
their
labors
and
the
commission
has
been
dissolved
in
conformity
with
the
recommendation
of
congress
a
proposition
was
early
made
to
the
british
government
to
abolish
the
mixed
courts
created
under
the
treaty
of
april
for
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
the
subject
is
still
under
negotiation
it
having
come
to
my
knowledge
that
a
corporate
company
organized
under
british
laws
proposed
to
land
upon
the
shores
of
the
united
states
and
to
operate
there
a
submarine
cable
under
a
concession
from
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
the
french
of
an
exclusive
right
for
twenty
years
of
telegraphic
communication
between
the
shores
of
france
and
the
united
states
with
the
very
objectionable
feature
of
subjecting
all
messages
conveyed
thereby
to
the
scrutiny
and
control
of
the
french
government
i
caused
the
french
and
british
legations
at
washington
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
probable
policy
of
congress
on
this
subject
as
foreshadowed
by
the
bill
which
passed
the
senate
in
march
last
this
drew
from
the
representatives
of
the
company
an
agreement
to
accept
as
the
basis
of
their
operations
the
provisions
of
that
bill
or
of
such
other
enactment
on
the
subject
as
might
be
passed
during
the
approaching
session
of
congress
also
to
use
their
influence
to
secure
from
the
french
government
a
modification
of
their
concession
so
as
to
permit
the
landing
upon
french
soil
of
any
cable
belonging
to
any
company
incorporated
by
the
authority
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
state
in
the
union
and
on
their
part
not
to
oppose
the
establishment
of
any
such
cable
in
consideration
of
this
agreement
i
directed
the
withdrawal
of
all
opposition
by
the
united
states
authorities
to
the
landing
of
the
cable
and
to
the
working
of
it
until
the
meeting
of
congress
i
regret
to
say
that
there
has
been
no
modification
made
in
the
companys
concession
nor
so
far
as
i
can
learn
have
they
attempted
to
secure
one
their
concession
excludes
the
capital
and
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
from
competition
upon
the
shores
of
france
i
recommend
legislation
to
protect
the
rights
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
dignity
and
sovereignty
of
the
nation
against
such
an
assumption
i
shall
also
endeavor
to
secure
by
negotiation
an
abandonment
of
the
principle
of
monopolies
in
ocean
telegraphic
cables
copies
of
this
correspondence
are
herewith
furnished
the
unsettled
political
condition
of
other
countries
less
fortunate
than
our
own
sometimes
induces
their
citizens
to
come
to
the
united
states
for
the
sole
purpose
of
becoming
naturalized
having
secured
this
they
return
to
their
native
country
and
reside
there
without
disclosing
their
change
of
allegiance
they
accept
official
positions
of
trust
or
honor
which
can
only
be
held
by
citizens
of
their
native
land
they
journey
under
passports
describing
them
as
such
citizens
and
it
is
only
when
civil
discord
after
perhaps
years
of
quiet
threatens
their
persons
or
their
property
or
when
their
native
state
drafts
them
into
its
military
service
that
the
fact
of
their
change
of
allegiance
is
made
known
they
reside
permanently
away
from
the
united
states
they
contribute
nothing
to
its
revenues
they
avoid
the
duties
of
its
citizenship
and
they
only
make
themselves
known
by
a
claim
of
protection
i
have
directed
the
diplomatic
and
consular
officers
of
the
united
states
to
scrutinize
carefully
all
such
claims
for
protection
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
whether
native
or
adopted
who
discharges
his
duty
to
his
country
is
entitled
to
its
complete
protection
while
i
have
a
voice
in
the
direction
of
affairs
i
shall
not
consent
to
imperil
this
sacred
right
by
conferring
it
upon
fictitious
or
fraudulent
claimants
on
the
accession
of
the
present
administration
it
was
found
that
the
minister
for
north
germany
had
made
propositions
for
the
negotiation
of
a
convention
for
the
protection
of
emigrant
passengers
to
which
no
response
had
been
given
it
was
concluded
that
to
be
effectual
all
the
maritime
powers
engaged
in
the
trade
should
join
in
such
a
measure
invitations
have
been
extended
to
the
cabinets
of
london
paris
florence
berlin
brussels
the
hague
copenhagen
and
stockholm
to
empower
their
representatives
at
washington
to
simultaneously
enter
into
negotiations
and
to
conclude
with
the
united
states
conventions
identical
in
form
making
uniform
regulations
as
to
the
construction
of
the
parts
of
vessels
to
be
devoted
to
the
use
of
emigrant
passengers
as
to
the
quality
and
quantity
of
food
as
to
the
medical
treatment
of
the
sick
and
as
to
the
rules
to
be
observed
during
the
voyage
in
order
to
secure
ventilation
to
promote
health
to
prevent
intrusion
and
to
protect
the
females
and
providing
for
the
establishment
of
tribunals
in
the
several
countries
for
enforcing
such
regulations
by
summary
process
your
attention
is
respectfully
called
to
the
law
regulating
the
tariff
on
russian
hemp
and
to
the
question
whether
to
fix
the
charges
on
russian
hemp
higher
than
they
are
fixed
upon
manila
is
not
a
violation
of
our
treaty
with
russia
placing
her
products
upon
the
same
footing
with
those
of
the
most
favored
nations
our
manufactures
are
increasing
with
wonderful
rapidity
under
the
encouragement
which
they
now
receive
with
the
improvements
in
machinery
already
effected
and
still
increasing
causing
machinery
to
take
the
place
of
skilled
labor
to
a
large
extent
our
imports
of
many
articles
must
fall
off
largely
within
a
very
few
years
fortunately
too
manufactures
are
not
confined
to
a
few
localities
as
formerly
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
will
become
more
and
more
diffused
making
the
interest
in
them
equal
in
all
sections
they
give
employment
and
support
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
at
home
and
retain
with
us
the
means
which
otherwise
would
be
shipped
abroad
the
extension
of
railroads
in
europe
and
the
east
is
bringing
into
competition
with
our
agricultural
products
like
products
of
other
countries
selfinterest
if
not
selfpreservation
therefore
dictates
caution
against
disturbing
any
industrial
interest
of
the
country
it
teaches
us
also
the
necessity
of
looking
to
other
markets
for
the
sale
of
our
surplus
our
neighbors
south
of
us
and
china
and
japan
should
receive
our
special
attention
it
will
be
the
endeavor
of
the
administration
to
cultivate
such
relations
with
all
these
nations
as
to
entitle
us
to
their
confidence
and
make
it
their
interest
as
well
as
ours
to
establish
better
commercial
relations
through
the
agency
of
a
more
enlightened
policy
than
that
heretofore
pursued
toward
china
largely
due
to
the
sagacity
and
efforts
of
one
of
our
own
distinguished
citizens
the
world
is
about
to
commence
largely
increased
relations
with
that
populous
and
hitherto
exclusive
nation
as
the
united
states
have
been
the
initiators
in
this
new
policy
so
they
should
be
the
most
earnest
in
showing
their
good
faith
in
making
it
a
success
in
thi
s
connection
i
advise
such
legislation
as
will
forever
preclude
the
enslavement
of
the
chinese
upon
our
soil
under
the
name
of
coolies
and
also
prevent
american
vessels
from
engaging
in
the
transportation
of
coolies
to
any
country
tolerating
the
system
i
also
recommend
that
the
mission
to
china
be
raised
to
one
of
the
first
class
on
my
assuming
the
responsible
duties
of
chief
magistrate
of
the
united
states
it
was
with
the
conviction
that
three
things
were
essential
to
its
peace
prosperity
and
fullest
development
first
among
these
is
strict
integrity
in
fulfilling
all
our
obligations
second
to
secure
protection
to
the
person
and
property
of
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
in
each
and
every
portion
of
our
common
country
wherever
he
may
choose
to
move
without
reference
to
original
nationality
religion
color
or
politics
demanding
of
him
only
obedience
to
the
laws
and
proper
respect
for
the
rights
of
others
third
union
of
all
the
states
with
equal
rights
indestructible
by
any
constitutional
means
to
secure
the
first
of
these
congress
has
taken
two
essential
steps
first
in
declaring
by
joint
resolution
that
the
public
debt
shall
be
paid
principal
and
interest
in
coin
and
second
by
providing
the
means
for
paying
providing
the
means
however
could
not
secure
the
object
desired
without
a
proper
administration
of
the
laws
for
the
collection
of
the
revenues
and
an
economical
disbursement
of
them
to
this
subject
the
administration
has
most
earnestly
addressed
itself
with
results
i
hope
satisfactory
to
the
country
there
has
been
no
hesitation
in
changing
officials
in
order
to
secure
an
efficient
execution
of
the
laws
sometimes
too
when
in
a
mere
party
view
undesirable
political
results
were
likely
to
follow
nor
any
hesitation
in
sustaining
efficient
officials
against
remonstrances
wholly
political
it
may
be
well
to
mention
here
the
embarrassment
possible
to
arise
from
leaving
on
the
statute
books
the
socalled
tenureofoffice
acts
and
to
earnestly
recommend
their
total
repeal
it
could
not
have
been
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
when
providing
that
appointments
made
by
the
president
should
receive
the
consent
of
the
senate
that
the
latter
should
have
the
power
to
retain
in
office
persons
placed
there
by
federal
appointment
against
the
will
of
the
president
the
law
is
inconsistent
with
a
faithful
and
efficient
administration
of
the
government
what
faith
can
an
executive
put
in
officials
forced
upon
him
and
those
too
whom
he
has
suspended
for
reason
how
will
such
officials
be
likely
to
serve
an
administration
which
they
know
does
not
trust
them
for
the
second
requisite
to
our
growth
and
prosperity
time
and
a
firm
but
humane
administration
of
existing
laws
amended
from
time
to
time
as
they
may
prove
ineffective
or
prove
harsh
and
unnecessary
are
probably
all
that
are
required
the
third
can
not
be
attained
by
special
legislation
but
must
be
regarded
as
fixed
by
the
constitution
itself
and
gradually
acquiesced
in
by
force
of
public
opinion
from
the
foundation
of
the
government
to
the
present
the
management
of
the
original
inhabitants
of
this
continentthe
indianshas
been
a
subject
of
embarrassment
and
expense
and
has
been
attended
with
continuous
robberies
murders
and
wars
from
my
own
experience
upon
the
frontiers
and
in
indian
countries
i
do
not
hold
either
legislation
or
the
conduct
of
the
whites
who
come
most
in
contact
with
the
indian
blameless
for
these
hostilities
the
past
however
can
not
be
undone
and
the
question
must
be
met
as
we
now
find
it
i
have
attempted
a
new
policy
toward
these
wards
of
the
nation
they
can
not
be
regarded
in
any
other
light
than
as
wards
with
fair
results
so
far
as
tried
and
which
i
hope
will
be
attended
ultimately
with
great
success
the
society
of
friends
is
well
known
as
having
succeeded
in
living
in
peace
with
the
indians
in
the
early
settlement
of
pennsylvania
while
their
white
neighbors
of
other
sects
in
other
sections
were
constantly
embroiled
they
are
also
known
for
their
opposition
to
all
strife
violence
and
war
and
are
generally
noted
for
their
strict
integrity
and
fair
dealings
these
considerations
induced
me
to
give
the
management
of
a
few
reservations
of
indians
to
them
and
to
throw
the
burden
of
the
selection
of
agents
upon
the
society
itself
the
result
has
proven
most
satisfactory
it
will
be
found
more
fully
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
for
superintendents
and
indian
agents
not
on
the
reservations
officers
of
the
army
were
selected
the
reasons
for
this
are
numerous
where
indian
agents
are
sent
there
or
near
there
troops
must
be
sent
also
the
agent
and
the
commander
of
troops
are
independent
of
each
other
and
are
subject
to
orders
from
different
departments
of
the
government
the
army
officer
holds
a
position
for
life
the
agent
one
at
the
will
of
the
president
the
former
is
personally
interested
in
living
in
harmony
with
the
indian
and
in
establishing
a
permanent
peace
to
the
end
that
some
portion
of
his
life
may
be
spent
within
the
limits
of
civilized
society
the
latter
has
no
such
personal
interest
another
reason
is
an
economic
one
and
still
another
the
hold
which
the
government
has
upon
a
life
officer
to
secure
a
faithful
discharge
of
duties
in
carrying
out
a
given
policy
the
building
of
railroads
and
the
access
thereby
given
to
all
the
agricultural
and
mineral
regions
of
the
country
is
rapidly
bringing
civilized
settlements
into
contact
with
all
the
tribes
of
indians
no
matter
what
ought
to
be
the
relations
between
such
settlements
and
the
aborigines
the
fact
is
they
do
not
harmonize
well
and
one
or
the
other
has
to
give
way
in
the
end
a
system
which
looks
to
the
extinction
of
a
race
is
too
horrible
for
a
nation
to
adopt
without
entailing
upon
itself
the
wrath
of
all
christendom
and
engendering
in
the
citizen
a
disregard
for
human
life
and
the
rights
of
others
dangerous
to
society
i
see
no
substitute
for
such
a
system
except
in
placing
all
the
indians
on
large
reservations
as
rapidly
as
it
can
be
done
and
giving
them
absolute
protection
there
as
soon
as
they
are
fitted
for
it
they
should
be
induced
to
take
their
lands
in
severalty
and
to
set
up
territorial
governments
for
their
own
protection
for
full
details
on
this
subject
i
call
your
special
attention
to
the
reports
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
shows
the
expenditures
of
the
war
department
for
the
year
ending
june
to
be
of
which
was
disbursed
in
the
payment
of
debts
contracted
during
the
war
and
is
not
chargeable
to
current
army
expenses
his
estimate
of
for
the
expenses
of
the
army
for
the
next
fiscal
year
is
as
low
as
it
is
believed
can
be
relied
on
the
estimates
of
bureau
officers
have
been
carefully
scrutinized
and
reduced
wherever
it
has
been
deemed
practicable
if
however
the
condition
of
the
country
should
be
such
by
the
beginning
of
the
next
fiscal
year
as
to
admit
of
a
greater
concentration
of
troops
the
appropriation
asked
for
will
not
be
expended
the
appropriations
estimated
for
river
and
harbor
improvements
and
for
fortifications
are
submitted
separately
whatever
amount
congress
may
deem
proper
to
appropriate
for
these
purposes
will
be
expended
the
recommendation
of
the
general
of
the
army
that
appropriations
be
made
for
the
forts
at
boston
portland
new
york
philadelphia
new
orleans
and
san
francisco
if
for
no
other
is
concurred
in
i
also
ask
your
special
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
general
commanding
the
military
division
of
the
pacific
for
the
sale
of
the
seal
islands
of
st
paul
and
st
george
alaska
territory
and
suggest
that
it
either
be
complied
with
or
that
legislation
be
had
for
the
protection
of
the
seal
fisheries
from
which
a
revenue
should
be
derived
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
contains
a
synopsis
of
the
reports
of
the
heads
of
bureaus
of
the
commanders
of
military
divisions
and
of
the
districts
of
virginia
mississippi
and
texas
and
the
report
of
the
general
of
the
army
in
full
the
recommendations
therein
contained
have
been
well
considered
and
are
submitted
for
your
action
i
however
call
special
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
chief
of
ordnance
for
the
sale
of
arsenals
and
lands
no
longer
of
use
to
the
government
also
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
war
that
the
act
of
d
march
prohibiting
promotions
and
appointments
in
the
staff
corps
of
the
army
be
repealed
the
extent
of
country
to
be
garrisoned
and
the
number
of
military
posts
to
be
occupied
is
the
same
with
a
reduced
army
as
with
a
large
one
the
number
of
staff
officers
required
is
more
dependent
upon
the
latter
than
the
former
condition
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
accompanying
this
shows
the
condition
of
the
navy
when
this
administration
came
into
office
and
the
changes
made
since
strenuous
efforts
have
been
made
to
place
as
many
vessels
in
commission
or
render
them
fit
for
service
if
required
as
possible
and
to
substitute
the
sail
for
steam
while
cruising
thus
materially
reducing
the
expenses
of
the
navy
and
adding
greatly
to
its
efficiency
looking
to
our
future
i
recommend
a
liberal
though
not
extravagant
policy
toward
this
branch
of
the
public
service
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
furnishes
a
clear
and
comprehensive
exhibit
of
the
operations
of
the
postal
service
and
of
the
financial
condition
of
the
postoffice
department
the
ordinary
postal
revenues
for
the
year
ending
the
th
of
june
amounted
to
and
the
expenditures
to
showing
an
excess
of
expenditures
over
receipts
of
the
excess
of
expenditures
over
receipts
for
the
previous
year
amounted
to
the
increase
of
revenues
for
over
those
of

and
the
increase
of
expenditures
was
the
increased
revenue
in
exceeded
the
increased
revenue
in
by
and
the
increased
expenditure
in
was
less
than
the
increased
expenditure
in
showing
by
comparison
this
gratifying
feature
of
improvement
that
while
the
increase
of
expenditures
over
the
increase
of

in
was
the
increase
of
receipts
over
the
increase
of

in
was
your
attenti
on
is
respectfully
called
to
the
recommendations
made
by
the
postmastergeneral
for
authority
to
change
the
rate
of
compensation
to
the
main
trunk
railroad
lines
for
their
services
in
carrying
the
mails
for
having
postroute
maps
executed
for
reorganizing
and
increasing
the
efficiency
of
the
specialagency
service
for
increase
of
the
mail
service
on
the
pacific
and
for
establishing
mail
service
under
the
flag
of
the
union
on
the
atlantic
and
most
especially
do
i
call
your
attention
to
his
recommendation
for
the
total
abolition
of
the
franking
privilege
this
is
an
abuse
from
which
no
one
receives
a
commensurate
advantage
it
reduces
the
receipts
for
postal
service
from
to
per
cent
and
largely
increases
the
service
to
be
performed
the
method
by
which
postage
should
be
paid
upon
public
matter
is
set
forth
fully
in
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shows
that
the
quantity
of
public
lands
disposed
of
during
the
year
ending
the
th
of
june
was
acres
exceeding
that
of
the
preceding
year
by
acres
of
this
amount
acres
were
sold
for
cash
and
acres
entered
under
the
homestead
laws
the
remainder
was
granted
to
aid
in
the
construction
of
works
of
internal
improvement
approved
to
the
states
as
swamp
land
and
located
with
warrants
and
scrip
the
cash
receipts
from
all
sources
were
exceeding
those
of
the
preceding
year
during
the
last
fiscal
year
names
were
added
to
the
pension
rolls
and
dropped
therefrom
leaving
at
its
close
the
amount
paid
to
pensioners
including
the
compensation
of
disbursing
agents
was
an
increase
of
on
that
of
the
previous
year
the
munificence
of
congress
has
been
conspicuously
manifested
in
its
legislation
for
the
soldiers
and
sailors
who
suffered
in
the
recent
struggle
to
maintain
that
unity
of
government
which
makes
us
one
people
the
additions
to
the
pension
rolls
of
each
successive
year
since
the
conclusion
of
hostilities
result
in
a
great
degree
from
the
repeated
amendments
of
the
act
of
the
th
of
july
which
extended
its
provisions
to
cases
not
falling
within
its
original
scope
the
large
outlay
which
is
thus
occasioned
is
further
increased
by
the
more
liberal
allowance
bestowed
since
that
date
upon
those
who
in
the
line
of
duty
were
wholly
or
permanently
disabled
public
opinion
has
given
an
emphatic
sanction
to
these
measures
of
congress
and
it
will
be
conceded
that
no
part
of
our
public
burden
is
more
cheerfully
borne
than
that
which
is
imposed
by
this
branch
of
the
service
it
necessitates
for
the
next
fiscal
year
in
addition
to
the
amount
justly
chargeable
to
the
naval
pension
fund
an
appropriation
of
during
the
year
ending
the
th
of
september
the
patent
office

more
than
the

would
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
uniting
the
duties
of
supervising
the
education
of
freedmen
with
the
other
duties
devolving
upon
the
commissioner

it

the
desire

to
make

census

must
be
taken
during
the
year
more
complete
and
perfect
than
heretofore
i
would
suggest
early
action
upon
any
plan
that
may
be
agreed
upon
as
congress
at
the
last
session
appointed
a
committee
to
take
into

might
be
deemed
proper
in

desist
from

i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
claims
of
the
agricultural
bureau
for
liberal
appropriations
in
a
country
so
diversified
in
climate
and
soil
as
ours
and
with
a
population
so
largely
dependent
upon
agriculture
the
benefits
that
can
be
conferred
by
properly
fostering
this
bureau
are
incalculable
i
desire
respectfully
to
call
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
inadequate
salaries
of
a
number
of
the
most
important
offices
of
the
government
in
this
message
i
will
not
enumerate
them
but
will
specify
only
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
no
change
has
been
made
in
their
salaries
for
fifteen
years
within
that
time
the
labors
of
the
court
have
largely
increased
and
the
expenses
of
living
have
at
least
doubled
during
the
same
time
congress
has
twice
found
it
necessary
to
increase
largely
the
compensation
of
its
own
members
and
the
duty
which
it
owes
to
another
department
of
the
government
deserves
and
will
undoubtedly
receive
its
due
consideration
there
are
many
subjects
not
alluded
to
in
this
message
which
might
with
propriety
be
introduced
but
i
abstain
believing
that
your
patriotism
and
statesmanship
will
suggest
the
topics
and
the
legislation
most
conducive
to
the
interests
of
the
whole

on
my
part

promise
a
rigid

mexico

to
be
a
theater
of
civil
war
while
our
political
relations
with
that
country
have
undergone
no
change
we

at

make
a
survey

it
is
a
source
of
much
satisfaction
that
the
difficulties
which
for
a
moment
excited
some
political
apprehensions
and
caused
a
closing
of

that
there
is
a
good
prospect
that
the
route
will
soon
be
reopened
with
an
increase
of
capacity
and
adaptation
we
could
not
exaggerate
either
the
commercial
or
the
political
importance
of
that
great
improvement
it
would
be
doing
injustice
to
an
important
south
american
state
not
to
acknowledge
the
directness
frankness
and
cordiality
with
which
the
united
states
of
colombia
have
entered
into
intimate
relations
with
this
government
a
claims
convention
has
been
constituted
to
complete
the
unfinished
work
of
the
one
which
closed
its
session
in
the
new
liberal
constitution
of
venezuela
having
gone
into
effect
with
the
universal
acquiescence
of
the
people
the
government
under
it
has
been
recognized
and
diplomatic
intercourse
with
it
has
opened
in
a
cordial
and
friendly
spirit
the
longdeferred

an
earnest
and
cordial
friendship
continues
to
exist
between
the
two
countries
and
such
efforts
as
were
in
my
power
have
been
used
to
remove
misunderstanding
and
avert
a
threatened

us
a
pleasing
view
of
social

political
progress
in
that

it
may
be
expected
to
derive
new
vigor
from
american
influence
improved
by
the
rapid
disappearance
of
slavery
in
the

i
solicit
your
authority
to
furnish
to
the
republic
a
gunboat
at
moderate
cost
to
be
reimbursed
to
the
united
states
by
installments
such
a
vessel
is
needed
for
the
safety
of
that
state
against
the
native
african
races
and
in
liberian
hands
it
would
be
more
effective
in
arresting
the
african
slave
trade
than
a
squadron
in
our
own
hands
the
possession
of
the
least
organized
naval
force
would
stimulate
a
generous
ambition
in
the
republic
and
the
confidence
which
we
should
manifest
by
furnishing
it
would
win
forbearance
and
favor
toward
the

all
civilized
nations

has
been
undertaken
under
very
favorable
circumstances
by
an
association
of
american
citizens
with
the
cordial
good
will
and
support
as
well
of
this
government
as
of
those
of
great
britain

assurances
have
been
received
from
most
of
the

of
their
high
appreciation
of

their
readiness
to
cooperate
in
constructing
lines
tributary

satisfaction

america
and
great
britain
has
been
renewed
with
full
expectation
of
its
early
accomplishment
thus
it
is
hoped
that
with
the
return
of
domestic
peace
the
country
will
be
able
to
resume
with
energy
and
advantage
its
former
high
career
of
commerce
and
civilization
our
very
popular
and
estimable
representative
in
egypt
died
in
april
last
an
unpleasant
altercation
which
arose
between
the
temporary
incumbent
of
the
office
and
the
government
of
the
pasha
resulted
in
a
suspension
of
intercourse
the
evil
was
promptly
corrected
on
the
arrival
of
the
successor
in
the
consulate
and
our
relations
with
egypt
as
well
as
our
relations
with
the
barbary
powers
are
entirely
satisfactory
the
rebellion
which
has
so
long
been
flagrant
in
china
has
at
last
been
suppressed
with
the
cooperating
good
offices
of
this
government
and
of
the
other
western
commercial
states
the
judicial
consular
establishment
there
has
become
very
difficult
and
onerous
and
it
will
need
legislative
revision
to
adapt
it
to
the
extension
of
our
commerce
and
to
the
more
intimate
intercourse
which
has
been
instituted
with
the
government
and
people
of
that
vast
empire
china
seems
to
be
accepting
with
hearty
good
will
the
conventional
laws
which
regulate
commercial
and
social
intercourse
among
the
western
nations
owing
to
the
peculiar
situation
of
japan
and
the
anomalous
form
of
its
government
the
action
of
that
empire
in
performing
treaty
stipulations
is
inconstant
and
capricious
nevertheless
good
progress
has
been
effected
by
the
western
powers
moving
with
enlightened
concert
our
own
pecuniary
claims
have
been
allowed
or
put
in
course
of
settlement
and
the
inland
sea
has
been
reopened
to
commerce
there
is
reason
also
to
believe
that
these
proceedings
have
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
friendship
of
japan
toward
the
united
states
the
ports
of
norfolk
fernandina
and
pensacola
have
been
opened
by
proclamation
it
is
hoped
that
foreign
merchants
will
now
consider
whether
it
is
not
safer
and
more
profitable
to
themselves
as
well
as
just
to
the
united
states
to
resort
to
these
and
other
open
ports
than
it
is
to
pursue
through
many
hazards
and
at
vast
cost
a
contraband
trade
with
other
ports
which
are
closed
if
not
by
actual
military
occupation
at
least
by
a
lawful
and
effective
blockade
for
myself
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
power
and
duty
of
the
executive
under
the
law
of
nations
to
exclude
enemies
of
the
human
race
from
an
asylum
in
the
united
states
if
congress
should
think
that
proceedings
in
such
cases
lack
the
authority
of
law
or
ought
to
be
further
regulated
by
it
i
recommend
that
provision
be
made
for
effectually
preventing
foreign
slave
traders
from
acquiring
domicile
and
facilities
for
their
criminal
occupation
in
our
country
it
is
possible
that
if
it
were
new
and
open
question
the
maritime
powers
with
the
lights
they
now
enjoy
would
not
concede
the
privileges
of
a
naval
belligerent
to
the
insurgents
of
the
united
states
destitute
as
they
are
and
always
have
been
equally
of
ships
of
war
and
of
ports
and
harbors
disloyal
emissaries
have
been
neither
less
assiduous
nor
more
successful
during
the
last
year
than
they
were
before
that
time
in
their
efforts
under
favor
of
that
privilege
to
embroil
our
country
in
foreign
wars
the
desire
and
determination
of
the
governments
of
the
maritime
states
to
defeat
that
design
are
believed
to
be
as
sincere
as
and
can
not
be
more
earnest
than
our
own
nevertheless
unforeseen
political
difficulties
have
arisen
especially
in
brazilian
and
british
ports
and
on
the
northern
boundary
of
the
united
states
which
have
required
and
are
likely
to
continue
to
require
the
practice
of
constant
vigilance
and
a
just
and
conciliatory
spirit
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
of
the
nations
concerned
and
their
governments
commissioners
have
been
appointed
under
the
treaty
with
great
britain
on
the
adjustment
of
the
claims
of
the
hudsons
bay
and
pugets
sound
agricultural
companies
in
oregon
and
are
now
proceeding
to
the
execution
of
the
trust
assigned
to
them
in
view
of
the
insecurity
of
life
and
property
in
the
region
adjacent
to
the
canadian
border
by
reason
of
recent
assaults
and
depredations
committed
by
inimical
and
desperate
persons
who
are
harbored
there
it
has
been
thought
proper
to
give
notice
that
after
the
expiration
of
six
months
the
period
conditionally
stipulated
in
the
existing
arrangement
with
great
britain
the
united
states
must
hold
themselves
at
liberty
to
increase
their
naval
armament
upon
the
lakes
if
they
shall
find
that
proceeding
necessary
the
condition
of
the
border
will
necessarily
come
into
consideration
in
connection
with
the
question
of
continuing
or
modifying
the
rights
of
transit
from
canada
through
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
regulation
of
imposts
which
were
temporarily
established
by
the
reciprocity
treaty
of
the
th
june
i
desire
however
to
be
understood
while
making
this
statement
that
the
colonial
authorities
of
canada
are
not
deemed
to
be
intentionally
unjust
or
unfriendly
toward
the
united
states
but
on
the
contrary
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
with
the
approval
of
the
imperial
government
they
will
take
the
necessary
measures
to
prevent
new
incursions
across
the
border
the
act
passed
at
the
last
session
for
the
encouragement
of
immigration
has
so
far
as
was
possible
been
put
into
operation
it
seems
to
need
amendment
which
will
enable
the
officers
of
the
government
to
prevent
the
practice
of
frauds
against
the
immigrants
while
on
their
way
and
on
their
arrival
in
the
ports
so
as
to
secure
them
here
a
free
choice
of
avocations
and
places
of
settlement
a
liberal
disposition
toward
this
great
national
policy
is
manifested
by
most
of
the
european
states
and
ought
to
be
reciprocated
on
our
part
by
giving
the
immigrants
effective
national
protection
i
regard
our
immigrants
as
one
of
the
principal
replenishing
streams
which
are
appointed
by
providence
to
repair
the
ra
vages
of
internal
war
and
its
wastes
of
national
strength
and
health
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
secure
the
flow
of
that
stream
in
its
present
fullness
and
to
that
end
the
government
must
in
every
way
make
it
manifest
that
it
neither
needs
nor
designs
to
impose
involuntary
military
service
upon
those
who
come
from
other
lands
to
cast
their
lot
in
our
country
the
financial
affairs
of
the
government
have
been
successfully
administered
during
the
last
year
the
legislation
of
the
last
session
of
congress
has
beneficially
affected
the
revenues
although
sufficient
time
has
not
yet
elapsed
to
experience
the
full
effect
of
several
of
the
provisions
of
the
acts
of
congress
imposing
increased
taxation
the
receipts
during
the
year
from
all
sources
upon
the
basis
of
warrants
signed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
including
loans
and
the
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
day
of
july
were
and
the
aggregate
disbursements
upon
the
same
basis
were
leaving
a
balance
in
the
treasury
as
shown
by
warrants
of
deduct
from
these
amounts
the
amount
of
the
principal
of
the
public
debt
redeemed
and
the
amount
of
issues
in
substitution
therefor
and
the
actual
cash
operations
of
the
treasury
were
receipts
disbursements
which
leaves
a
cash
balance
in
the
treasury
of
of
the
receipts
there
were
derived
from
customs
from
lands
from
direct
taxes
from
internal
revenue
from
miscellaneous
sources
and
from
loans
applied
to
actual
expenditures
including
former
balance
there
were
disbursed
for
the
civil
service
for
pensions
and
indians
for
the
war
department
for
the
navy
department
for
interest
on
the
public
debt
making
an
aggregate
of
and
leaving
a
balance
in
the
treasury
of
as
before
stated
for
the
actual
receipts
and
disbursements
for
the
first
quarter
and
the
estimated
receipts
and
disbursements
for
the
three
remaining
quarters
of
the
current
fiscal
year
and
the
general
operations
of
the
treasury
in
detail
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
i
concur
with
him
in
the
opinion
that
the
proportion
of
moneys
required
to
meet
the
expenses
consequent
upon
the
war
derived
from
taxation
should
be
still
further
increased
and
i
earnestly
invite
your
attention
to
this
subject
to
the
end
that
there
may
be
such
additional
legislation
as
shall
be
required
to
meet
the
just
expectations
of
the
secretary
the
public
debt
on
the
st
day
of
july
last
as
appears
by
the
books
of
the
treasury
amounted
to
probably
should
the
war
continue
for
another
year
that
amount
may
be
increased
by
not
far
from
five
hundred
millions
held
as
it
is
for
the
most
part
by
our
own
people
it
has
become
a
substantial
branch
of
national
though
private
property
for
obvious
reasons
the
more
nearly
this
property
can
be
distributed
among
all
the
people
the
better
to
favor
such
general
distribution
greater
inducements
to
become
owners
might
perhaps
with
good
effect
and
without
injury
be
presented
to
persons
of
limited
means
with
this
view
i
suggest
whether
it
might
not
be
both
competent
and
expedient
for
congress
to
provide
that
a
limited
amount
of
some
future
issue
of
public
securities
might
be
held
by
any
bona
fide
purchaser
exempt
from
taxation
and
from
seizure
for
debt
under
such
restrictions
and
limitations
as
might
be
necessary
to
guard
against
abuse
of
so
important
a
privilege
this
would
enable
every
prudent
person
to
set
aside
a
small
annuity
against
a
possible
day
of
want
privileges
like
these
would
render
the
possession
of
such
securities
to
the
amount
limited
most
desirable
to
every
person
of
small
means
who
might
be
able
to
save
enough
for
the
purpose
the
great
advantage
of
citizens
being
creditors
as
well
as
debtors
with
relation
to
the
public
debt
is
obvious
men
readily
perceive
that
they
can
not
be
much
oppressed
by
a
debt
which
they
owe
to
themselves
the
public
debt
on
the
st
day
of
july
last
although
somewhat
exceeding
the
estimate
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
made
to
congress
at
the
commencement
of
the
last
session
falls
short
of
the
estimate
of
that
officer
made
in
the
preceding
december
as
to
its
probable
amount
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
by
the
sum
of
this
fact
exhibits
a
satisfactory
condition
and
conduct
of
the
operations
of
the
treasury
the
national
banking
system
is
proving
to
be
acceptable
to
capitalists
and
to
the
people
on
the
th
day
of
november
national
banks
had
been
organized
a
considerable
number
of
which
were
conversions
from
state
banks
changes
from
state
systems
to
the
national
system
are
rapidly
taking
place
and
it
is
hoped
that
very
soon
there
will
be
in
the
united
states
no
banks
of
issue
not
authorized
by
congress
and
no
banknote
circulation
not
secured
by
the
government
that
the
government
and
the
people
will
derive
great
benefit
from
this
change
in
the
banking
systems
of
the
country
can
hardly
be
questioned
the
national
system
will
create
a
reliable
and
permanent
influence
in
support
of
the
national
credit
and
protect
the
people
against
losses
in
the
use
of
paper
money
whether
or
not
any
further
legislation
is
advisable
for
the
suppression
of
statebank
issues
it
will
be
for
congress
to
determine
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
treasury
can
not
be
satisfactorily
conducted
unless
the
government
can
exercise
a
restraining
power
over
the
banknote
circulation
of
the
country
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
accompanying
documents
will
detail
the
campaigns
of
the
armies
in
the
field
since
the
date
of
the
last
annual
message
and
also
the
operations
of
the
several
administrative
bureaus
of
the
war
department
during
the
last
year
it
will
also
specify
the
measures
deemed
essential
for
the
national
defense
and
to
keep
up
and
supply
the
requisite
military
force
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
presents
a
comprehensive
and
satisfactory
exhibit
of
the
affairs
of
that
department
and
of
the
naval
service
it
is
a
subject
of
congratulation
and
laudable
pride
to
our
countrymen
that
a
navy
of
such
vast
proportions
has
been
organized
in
so
brief
a
period
and
conducted
with
so
much
efficiency
and
success
the

in

to
a
navyyard
and
suitable
establishment
for
the
construction

repair
of

your
attention
is
also
invited
to
the
views
expressed
in

report
in
relation
to
the
legislation
of
congress
at
its
last
session
in
respect
to
prize
on
our
inland

i
cordially
concur
in
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
as
to
the
propriety
of
creating
the
new
rank
of
viceadmiral
in
our
naval
service
your
attention
is
invited
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
for
a
detailed
account
of
the
operations
and
financial
condition
of
the
postoffice
department
the
postal
revenues
for
the
year
ending
june
amounted
to
and
the
expenditures
to
the
excess
of
expenditures
over
receipts
being
the
views
presented
by
the
postmastergeneral
on
the
subject
of
special
grants
by
the
government
in
aid
of
the
establishment
of
new
lines
of
ocean
mail
steamships
and
the
policy
he
recommends
for
the
development
of
increased
commercial
intercourse
with
adjacent
and
neighboring
countries
should
receive
the
careful
consideration
of
congress
it
is
of
noteworthy
interest
that
the
steady
expansion
of
population
improvement
and
governmental
institutions
over
the
new
and
unoccupied
portions
of
our
country
have
scarcely
been
checked
much
less
impeded
or
destroyed
by
our
great
civil
war
which
at
first
glance
would
seem
to
have
absorbed
almost
the
entire
energies
of
the
nation
the
organization
and
admission
of
the
state
of
nevada
has
been
completed
in
conformity
with
law
and
thus
our
excellent
system
is
firmly
established
in
the
mountains
which
once
seemed
a
barren
and
uninhabitable
waste
between
the
atlantic
states
and
those
which
have
grown
up
on
the
coast
of
the
pacific
ocean
the
territories
of
the
union
are
generally
in
a
condition
of
prosperity
and
rapid
growth
idaho
and
montana
by
reason
of
their
great
distance
and
the
interruption
of
communication
with
them
by
indian
hostilities
have
been
only
partially
organized
but
it
is
understood
that
these
difficulties
are
about
to
disappear
which
will
permit
their
governments
like
those
of
the
others
to
go
into
speedy
and
full
operation
as
intimately
connected
with
and
promotive
of
this
material
growth
of
the
nation
i
ask
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
valuable
information
and
important
recommendations
relating
to
the
public
lands
indian
affairs
the
pacific
railroad
and
mineral
discoveries
contained
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
is
herewith
transmitted
and
which
report
also
embraces
the
subjects
of
patents
pensions
and
other
topics
of
public
interest
pertaining
to
his
department
the
quantity
of
public
land
disposed
of
during
the
five
quarters
ending
on
the
th
of
september
last
was
acres
of
which
acres
were

the
remainder
was
located
with

land
warrants
agricultural
scrip
certified
to

the

was
the
income
from

ending

during
the
preceding

the
aggregate
number
of

surveyed
during
the

has
been
equal
to
the
quantity

there
is
open
to
settlement
about

the
great
enterprise
of
connecting
the
atlantic
with
the
pacific
states
by
railways
and
telegraph
lines
has
been
entered
upon
with
a
vigor
that
gives
assurance
of
success
notwithstanding
the
embarrassments
arising
from
the
prevailing
high
prices
of
materials
and
labor
the
route
of
the
main
line
of
the

has
been
definitely
located
for
miles
westward
from
the
initial

a
preliminary
location
of
the

railroad
of

numerous

heretofore
known

the
country
occupied
by
the
sierra
nevada
and
rocky
mountains
and
the
subordinate
ranges
now
teems
with
enterprising
labor
which
is
richly
remunerative
it
is
believed
that
the
product
of
the
mines
of
precious
metals
in
that
region
has
during
the
year
reached
if
not
exceeded
one
hundred
millions
in
value
it
was
recommended
in
my
last
annual
message
that
our
indian
system
be
remodeled
congress
at
its
last
session
acting
upon
the
recommendation
did
provide
for
reorganizing
the
system
in
california
and
it
is
believed
that
under
the
present
organization
the
management
of
the
indians
there
will
be
attended
with
reasonable
success
much
yet
remains
to
be
done
to
provide
for
the
proper
government
of
the
indians
in
other
parts
of
the
country
to
render
it
secure
for
the
advancing
settier
and
to
provide
for
the
welfare
of
the
indian
the
secretary
reiterates
his
recommendations
and
to
them
the
attention
of
congress
is
invited
the
liberal
provisions
made
by

for
paying
pensions
to

there
have
been
added

ending

the

invalid
pensioners
of

have

the

of
this

of

at
the
beginning
of
the

the
number

revolutionary
pensioners
was
only
of
them
were
soldiers
of
whom
have
since
died
the
remainder
are
those
who
under

receive

because
of

during

cheerfully
commend

the
benevolent

of

which
have
hitherto
been
established

by

to

report
of
the

the
agricultural

under
the
supervision
of
its
present
energetic
and
faithful
head
is
rapidly
commending
itself
to
the
great
and
vital
interest
it
was
created
to
advance
it
is
peculiarly
the
peoples
department
in
which
they
feel
more
directly
concerned
than
in
any
other
i
commend
it
to
the
continued
attention
and
fostering
care
of
congress
the
war
continues
since
the
last
annual
message
all
the
important
lines
and
positions
then
occupied
by
our
forces
have
been
maintained
and
our
arms
have
steadily
advanced
thus
liberating
the
regions
left
in
rear
so
that
missouri
kentucky
tennessee
and
parts
of
other
states
have
again
produced
reasonably
fair
crops
the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
military
operations
of
the
year
is
general
shermans
attempted
march
of
miles
directly
through
the
insurgent
region
it
tends
to
show
a
great
increase
of
our
relative
strength
that
our
general
in
chief
should
feel
able
to
confront
and
hold
in
check
every
active
force
of
the
enemy
and
yet
to
detach
a
wellappointed
large
army
to
move
on
such
an
expedition
the
result
not
yet
being
known
conjecture
in
regard
to
it
is
not
here
indulged
important
movements
have
also
occurred
during
the
year
to
the
effect
of
molding
society
for
durability
in
the
union
although
short
of
complete
success
it
is
much
in
the
fight
direction
that
citizens
in
each
of
the
states
of
arkansas
and
louisiana
have
organized
loyal
state
governments
with
free
constitutions
and
are
earnestly
struggling
to
maintain
and
administer
them
the
movements
in
the
same
direction
more
extensive
though
less
definite
in
missouri
kentucky
and
tennessee
should
not
be
overlooked
but
maryland
presents
the
example
of
complete
success
maryland
is
secure
to
liberty
and
union
for
all
the
future
the
genius
of
rebellion
will
no
more
claim
maryland
like
another
foul
spirit
being
driven
out
it
may
seek
to
tear
her
but
it
will
woo
her
nomore
at
the
last
session
of
congress
a
proposed
amendment
of
the
constitution
abolishing
slavery
throughout
the
united
states
passed
the
senate
but
failed
for
lack
of
the
requisite
twothirds
vote
in
the
house
of
representatives
although
the
present
is
the
same
congress
and
nearly
the
same
members
and
without
questioning
the
wisdom
or
patriotism
of
those
who
stood
in
opposition
i
venture
to
recommend
the
reconsideration
and
passage
of
the
measure
at
the
present
session
of
course
the
abstract
question
is
not
changed
but
in
intervening
election
shows
almost
certainly
that
the
next
congress
will
pass
the
measure
if
this
does
not
hence
there
is
only
a
question
of
time
as
to
when
the
proposed
amendment
will
go
to
the
states
for
their
action
and
as
it
is
to
so
go
at
all
events
may
we
not
agree
that
the
sooner
the
better
it
is
not
claimed
that
the
election
has
imposed
a
duty
on
members
to
change
their
views
or
their
votes
any
further
than
as
an
additional
element
to
be
considered
their
judgment
may
be
affected
by
it
it
is
the
voice
of
the
people
now
for
the
first
time
heard
upon
the
question
in
a
great
national
crisis
like
ours
unanimity
of
action
among
those
seeking
a
common
end
is
very
desirablealmost
indispensable
and
yet
no
approach
to
such
unanimity
is
attainable
unless
some
deference
shall
be
paid
to
the
will
of
the
majority
simply
because
it
is
the
will
of
the
majority
in
this
case
the
common
end
is
the
maintenance
of
the
union
and
among
the
means
to
secure
that
end
such
will
through
the
election
is
most
dearly
declared
in
favor
of
such
constitutional
amendment
the
most
reliable
indication
of
public
purpose
in
this
country
is
derived
through
our
popular
elections
judging
by
the
recent
canvass
and
its
result
the
purpose
of
the
people
within
the
loyal
states
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
union
was
never
more
firm
nor
more
nearly
unanimous
than
now
the
extraordinary
calmness
and
good
order
with
which
the
millions
of
voters
met
and
mingled
at
the
polls
give
strong
assurance
of
this
not
only
all
those
who
supported
the
union
ticket
so
called
but
a
great
majority
of
the
opposing
party
also
may
be
fairly
claimed
to
entertain
and
to
be
actuated
by
the
same
purpose
it
is
an
unanswerable
argument
to
this
effect
that
no
candidate
for
any
office
whatever
high
or
low
has
ventured
to
seek
votes
on
the
avowal
that
he
was
for
giving
up
the
union
there
have
been
much
impugning
of
motives
and
much
heated
controversy
as
to
the
proper
means
and
best
mode
of
advancing
the
union
cause
but
on
the
distinct
issue
of
union
or
no
union
the
politicians
have
shown
their
instinctive
knowledge
that
there
is
no
diversity
among
the
people
in
affording
the
people
the
fair
opportunity
of
showing
one
to
another
and
to
the
world
this
firmness
and
unanimity
of
purpose
the
election
has
been
of
vast
value
to
the
national
cause
the
election
has
exhibited
another
tact
not
less
valuable
to
be
knownthe
fact
that
we
do
not
approach
exhaustion
in
the
most
important
branch
of
national
resources
that
of
living
men
while
it
is
melancholy
to
reflect
that
the
war
has
filled
so
many
graves
and
carried
mourning
to
so
many
hearts
it
is
some
relief
to
know
that
compared
with
the
surviving
the
fallen
have
been
so
few
while
corps
and
divisions
and
brigades
and
regiments
have
formed
and
fought
and
dwindled
and
gone
out
of
existence
a
great
majority
of
the
men
who
composed
them
are
still
living
the
same
is
true
of
the
naval
service
the
election
returns
prove
this
so
many
voters
could
not
else
be
found

did
not

thus
swelling
the
aggregate

and
the
net
increase
during
the
three
years
and
a
half
of
war
to
a
table
is
appended
showing
particulars
to
this
again
should
be
added
the
number
of
all
soldiers
in
the
field
from
massachusetts
rhode
island
new
jersey
delaware
indiana
illinois
and
california
who
by
the
laws
of
those
states
could
not
vote
away
from
their
homes
and
which
number
can
not
be
less
than
nor
yet
is
this
all
the
number
in
organized
territories
is
triple
now
what
it
was
four
years
ago
while
thousands
white
and
black
join
us
as
the
national
arms
press
back
the
insurgent
lines
so
much
is
shown
affirmatively
and
negatively
by
the
election
it
is
not
material
to
inquire
how
the
increase
has
been
produced
or
to
show
that
it
would
have
been
greater
but
for
the
war
which
is
probably
true
the
important
fact
remains
demonstrated
that
we
have
more
men
now
than
we
had
when
the
war
began
that
we
are
not
exhausted
nor
in
process
of
exhaus
tion
that
we
are
gaining
strength
and
may
if
need
be
maintain
the
contest
indefinitely
this
as
to
men
material
resources
are
now
more
complete
and
abundant
than
ever
the
national
resources
then
are
unexhausted
and
as
we
believe
inexhaustible
the
public
purpose
to
reestablish
and
maintain
the
national
authority
is
unchanged
and
as
we
believe
unchangeable
the
manner
of
continuing
the
effort
remains
to
choose
on
careful
consideration
of
all
the
evidence
accessible
it
seems
to
me
that
no
attempt
at
negotiation
with
the
insurgent
leader
could
result
in
any
good
he
would
accept
nothing
short
of
severance
of
the
union
precisely
what
we
will
not
and
can
not
give
his
declarations
to
this
effect
are
explicit
and
oft
repeated
he
does
not
attempt
to
deceive
us
he
affords
us
no
excuse
to
deceive
ourselves
he
can
not
voluntarily
reaccept
the
union
we
can
not
voluntarily
yield
it
between
him
and
us
the
issue
is
distinct
simple
and
inflexible
it
is
an
issue
which
can
only
be
tried
by
war
and
decided
by
victory
if
we
yield
we
are
beaten
if
the
southern
people
fail
him
he
is
beaten
either
way
it
would
be
the
victory
and
defeat
following
war
what
is
true
however
of
him
who
heads
the
insurgent
cause
is
not
necessarily
true
of
those
who
follow
although
he
can
not
reaccept
the
union
they
can
some
of
them
we
know
already
desire
peace
and
reunion
the
number
of
such
may
increase
they
can
at
any
moment
have
peace
simply
by
laying
down
their
arms
and
submitting
to
the
national
authority
under
the
constitution
alter
so
much
the
government
could
not
if
it
would
maintain
war
against
them
the
loyal
people
would
not
sustain
or
allow
it
if
questions
should
remain
we
would
adjust
them
by
the
peaceful
means
of
legislation
conference
courts
and
votes
operating
only
in
constitutional
and
lawful
channels
some
certain
and
other
possible
questions
are
and
would
be
beyond
the
executive
power
to
adjust
as
for
instance
the
admission
of
members
into
congress
and
whatever
might
require
the
appropriation
of
money
the
executive
power
itself
would
be
greatly
diminished
by
the
cessation
of
actual
war
pardons
and
remissions
of
forfeitures
however
would
still
be
within
executive
control
in
what
spirit
and
temper
this
control
would
be
exercised
can
be
fairly
judged
of
by
the
past
a
year
ago
general
pardon
and
amnesty
upon
specified
terms
were
offered
to
all
except
certain
designated
classes
and
it
was
at
the
same
time
made
known
that
the
excepted
classes
were
still
within
contemplation
of
special
clemency
during
the
year
many
availed
themselves
of
the
general
provision
and
many
more
would
only
that
the
signs
of
bad
faith
in
some
led
to
such
precautionary
measures
as
rendered
the
practical
process
less
easy
and
certain
during
the
same
time
also
special
pardons
have
been
granted
to
individuals
of
the
excepted
classes
and
no
voluntary
application
has
been
denied
thus
practically
the
door
has
been
for
a
full
year
open
to
all
except
such
as
were
not
in
condition
to
make
free
choice
that
is
such
as
were
in
custody
or
under
constraint
it
is
still
so
open
to
all
but
the
time
may
come
probably
will
come
when
public
duty
shall
demand
that
it
be
closed
and
that
in
lieu
more
rigorous
measures
than
heretofore
shall
be
adopted
in
presenting
the
abandonment
of
armed
resistance
to
the
national
authority
on
the
part
of
the
insurgents
as
the
only
indispensable
condition
to
ending
the
war
on
the
part
of
the
government
i
retract
nothing
heretofore
said
as
to
slavery
i
repeat
the
declaration
made
a
year
a
ago
that
while
i
remain
in
my
present
position
i
shall
not
attempt
to
retract
or
modify
the
emancipation
proclamation
nor
shall
i
return
to
slavery
any
person
who
is
free
by
the
terms
of
that
proclamation

by
any
of
the
acts
of

if
the

should
by
whatever
mode
or
means
make
it
an
executive
duty
to
reenslave
such
persons
another
and
not
i
must
be
their
instrument
to
perform
it
in
stating
a
single
condition
of
peace
i
mean
simply
to
say
that
the
war
will
cease
on
the
part

it
shall
have

convention
for
the
adjustment
of
possessory
claims
in
washington
territory
arising
out
of
the
treaty
of
the
th
june
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
and
which
have
been
the
source
of
some
disquiet
among
the
citizens
of
that
now
rapidly
improving
part
of
the
country
a
novel
and
important
question
involving
the
extent
of
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
spain
in
the
waters
which
surround
the
island
of
cuba
has
been
debated
without
reaching
an
agreement
and
it
is
proposed
in
an
amicable
spirit
to
refer
it
to
the
arbitrament
of
a
friendly
power
a
convention
for
that
purpose
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
i
have
thought
it
proper
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
senate
to
concur
with
the
interested
commercial
powers
in
an
arrangement
for
the
liquidation
of
the
scheldt
dues
upon
the
principles
which
have
been
heretofore
adopted
in
regard
to
the
imposts
upon
navigation
in
the
waters
of
denmark
the
longpending
controversy
between
this
government
and
that
of
chile
touching
the
seizure
at
sitana
in
peru
by
chilean
officers
of
a
large
amount
in
treasure
belonging
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
has
been
brought
to
a
close
by
the
award
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
the
belgians
to
whose
arbitration
the
question
was
referred
by
the
parties
the
subject
was
thoroughly
and
patiently
examined
by
that
justly
respected
magistrate
and
although
the
sum
awarded
to
the
claimants
may
not
have
been
as
large
as
they
expected
there
is
no
reason
to
distrust
the
wisdom
of
his
majestys
decision
that
decision
was
promptly
complied
with
by
chile
when
intelligence
in
regard
to
it
reached
that
country
the
joint
commission
under
the
act
of
the
last
session
for
carrying
into
effect
the
convention
with
peru
on
the
subject
of
claims
has
been
organized
at
lima
and
is
engaged
in
the
business
intrusted
to
it
difficulties
concerning
interoceanic
transit
through
nicaragua
are
in
course
of
amicable
adjustment
in
conformity
with
principles
set
forth
in
my
last
annual
message
i
have
received
a
representative
from
the
united
states
of
colombia
and
have
accredited
a
minister
to
that
republic
incidents
occurring
in
the
progress
of
our
civil
war
have
forced
upon
my
attention
the
uncertain
state
of
international
questions
touching
the
rights
of
foreigners
in
this
country
and
of
united
states
citizens
abroad
in
regard
to
some
governments
these
rights
are
at
least
partially
defined
by
treaties
in
no
instance
however
is
it
expressly
stipulated
that
in
the
event
of
civil
war
a
foreigner
residing
in
this
country
within
the
lines
of
the
insurgents
is
to
be
exempted
from
the
rule
which
classes
him
as
a
belligerent
in
whose
behalf
the
government
or
his
country
can
not
expect
any
privileges
or
immunities
distinct
from
that
character
i
regret
to
say
however
that
such
claims
have
been
put
forward
and
in
some
instances
in
behalf
of
foreigners
who
have
lived
in
the
united
states
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
many
persons
born
in
foreign
countries
who
have
declared
their
intention
to
become
citizens
or
who
have
been
fully
naturalized
have
evaded
the
military
duty
required
of
them
by
denying
the
fact
and
thereby
throwing
upon
the
government
the
burden
of
proof
it
has
been
found
difficult
or
impracticable
to
obtain
this
proof
from
the
want
of
guides
to
the
proper
sources
of
information
these
might
be
supplied
by
requiring
clerks
of
courts
where
declarations
of
intention
may
be
made
or
naturalizations
effected
to
send
periodically
lists
of
the
names
of
the
persons
naturalized
or
declaring
their
intention
to
become
citizens
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
whose
department
those
names
might
be
arranged
and
printed
for
general
information
there
is
also
reason
to
believe
that
foreigners
frequently
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
the
sole
purpose
of
evading
duties
imposed
by
the
laws
of
their
native
countries
to
which
on
becoming
naturalized
here
they
at
once
repair
and
though
never
returning
to
the
united
states
they
still
claim
the
interposition
of
this
government
as
citizens
many
altercations
and
great
prejudices
have
heretofore
arisen
out
of
this
abuse
it
is
therefore
submitted
to
your
serious
consideration
it
might
be
advisable
to
fix
a
limit
beyond
which
no
citizen
of
the
united
states
residing
abroad
may
claim
the
interposition
of
his
government
the
right
of
suffrage
has
often
been
assumed
and
exercised
by
aliens
under
pretenses
of
naturalization
which
they
have
disavowed
when
drafted
into
the
military
service
i
submit
the
expediency
of
such
an
amendment
of
the
law
as
will
make
the
fact
of
voting
an
estoppel
against
any
plea
of
exemption
from
military
service
or
other
civil
obligation
on
the
ground
of
alienage
in
common
with
other
western
powers
our
relations
with
japan
have
been
brought
into
serious
jeopardy
through
the
perverse
opposition
of
the
hereditary
aristocracy
of
the
empire
to
the
enlightened
and
liberal
policy
of
the
tycoon
designed
to
bring
the
country
into
the
society
of
nations
it
is
hoped
although
not
with
entire
confidence
that
these
difficulties
may
be
peacefully
overcome
i
ask
your
attention
to
the
claim
of
the
minister
residing
there
for
the
damages
he
sustained
in
the
destruction
by
fire
of
the
residence
of
the
legation
at
yedo
satisfactory
arrangements
have
been
made
with
the
emperor
of
russia
which
it
is
believed
will
result
in
effecting
a
continuous
line
of
telegraph
through
that
empire
from
our
pacific
coast
i
recommend
to
your
favorable
consideration
the
subject
of
an
international
telegraph
across
the
atlantic
ocean
and
also
of
a
telegraph
between
this
capital
and
the
national
forts
along
the
atlantic
seaboard
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
such
communications
established
with
any
reasonable
outlay
would
be
economical
as
well
as
effective
aids
to
the
diplomatic
military
and
naval
service
the
consular
system
of
the
united
states
under
the
enactments
of
the
last
congress
begins
to
be
selfsustaining
and
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
it
may
become
entirely
so
with
the
increase
of
trade
which
will
ensue
whenever
peace
is
restored
our
ministers
abroad
have
been
faithful
in
defending
american
rights
in
protecting
commercial
interests
our
consuls
have
necessarily
had
to
encounter
increased
labors
and
responsibilities
growing
out
of
the
war
these
they
have
for
the
most
part
met
and
discharged
with
zeal
and
efficiency
this
acknowledgment
justly
includes
those
consuls
who
residing
in
morocco
egypt
turkey
japan
china
and
other
oriental
countries
are
charged
with
complex
functions
and
extraordinary
powers
the
condition
of
the
several
organized
territories
is
generally
satisfactory
although
indian
disturbances
in
new
mexico
have
not
been
entirely
suppressed
the
mineral
resources
of
colorado
nevada
idaho
new
mexico
and
arizona
are
proving
far
richer
than
has
been
heretofore
understood
i
lay
before
you
a
communication
on
this
subject
from
the
governor
of
new
mexico
i
again
submit
to
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
establishing
a
system
for
the
encouragement
of
immigration
although
this
source
of
national
wealth
and
strength
is
again
flowing
with
greater
freedom
than
for
several
years
before
the
insurrection
occurred
there
is
still
a
great
deficiency
of
laborers
in
every
field
of
industry
especially
in
agriculture
and
in
our
mines
as
well
of
iron
and
coal
as
of
the
precious
metals
while
the
demand
for
labor
is
much
increased
here
tens
of
thousands
of
persons
destitute
of
remunerative
occupation
are
thronging
our
foreign
consulates
and
offering
to
emigrate
to
the
united
states
if
essential
but
very
cheap
assistance
can
be
afforded
them
it
is
easy
to
see
that
under
the
sharp
discipline
of
civil
war
the
nation
is
beginning
a
new
life
this
noble
effort
demands
the
aid
and
ought
to
receive
the
attention
and
support
of
the
government
injuries
unforeseen
by
the
government
and
unintended
may
in
some
cases
have
been
inflicted
on
the
subjects
or
citizens
of
foreign
countries
both
at
sea
and
on
land
by
persons
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
as
this
government
expects
redress
from
other
powers
when
similar
injuries
are
inflicted
by
persons
in
their
service
upon
citizens
of
the
united
states
we
must
be
prepared
to
do
justice
to
foreigners
if
the
existing
judicial
tribunals
are
inadequate
to
this
purpose
a
special
court
may
be
authorized
with
power
to
hear
and
decide
such
claims
of
the
character
referred
to
as
may
have
arisen
under
treaties
and
the
public
law
conventions
for

adjusting
the
claims
by
joint
commission
have
been
proposed
to
some
governments
but
no
definitive
answer
to
the
proposition
has
yet
been
received
from
any
in
the
course
of
the
session
i
shall
probably
have
occasion
to
request
you
to
provide
indemnification
to
claimants
where
decrees
of
restitution
have
been
rendered
and
damages
awarded
by
admiralty
courts
and
in
other
cases
where
this
government
may
be
acknowledged
to
be
liable
in
principle
and
where
the
amount
of
that
liability
has
been
ascertained
by
an
informal
arbitration
the
proper
officers
of
the
treasury
have
deemed
themselves
required
by
the
law
of
the
united
states
upon
the
subject
to
demand
a
tax
upon
the
incomes
of
foreign
consuls
in
this
country
while
such
a
demand
may
not
in
strictness
be
in
derogation
of
public
law
or
perhaps
of
any
existing
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
a
foreign
country
the
expediency
of
so
far
modifying
the
act
as
to
exempt
from
tax
the
income
of
such
consuls
as
are
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
derived
from
the
emoluments
of
their
office
or
from
property
not
situated
in
the
united
states
is
submitted
to
your
serious
consideration
i
make
this
suggestion
upon
the
ground
that
a
comity
which
ought
to
be
reciprocated
exempts
our
consuls
in
all
other
countries
from
taxation
to
the
extent
thus
indicated
the
united
states
i
think
ought
not
to
be
exceptionally
illiberal
to
international
trade
and
commerce
the
operations
of
the
treasury
during
the
last
year
have
been
successfully
conducted
the
enactment
by
congress
of
a
national
banking
law
has
proved
a
valuable
support
of
the
public
credit
and
the
general
legislation
in
relation
to
loans
has
fully
answered
the
expectations
of
its
favorers
some
amendments
may
be
required
to
perfect
existing
laws
but
no
change
in
their
principles
or
general
scope
is
believed
to
be
needed
since
these
measures
have
been
in
operation
all
demands
on
the
treasury
including
the
pay
of
the
army
and
navy
have
been
promptly
met
and
fully
satisfied
no
considerable
body
of
troops
it
is
believed
were
ever
more
amply
provided
and
more
liberally
and
punctually
paid
and
it
may
be
added
that
by
no
people
were
the
burdens
incident
to
a
great
war
ever
more
cheerfully
borne
the
receipts
during
the
year
from
all
sources
including
loans
and
balance
in
the
treasury
at
its
commencement
were
and
the
aggregate
disbursements
leaving
a
balance
on
the
st
of
july
of
of
the
receipts
there
were
derived
from
customs
from
internal
revenue
from
direct
tax
from
lands
from
miscellaneous
sources
and
from
loans
making
the
aggregate
of
the
disbursements
there
were
for
the
civil
service
for
pensions
and
indians
for
interest
on
public
debt
for
the
war
department
for
the
navy
department
for
payment
of
funded
and
temporary
debt
making
the
aggregate
and
leaving
the
balance
of
but
the
payment
of
funded
and
temporary
debt
having
been
made
from
moneys
borrowed
during
the
year
must
be
regarded
as
merely
nominal
payments
and
the
moneys
borrowed
to
make
them
as
merely
nominal
receipts
and
their
amount
should
therefore
be
deducted
both
from
receipts
and
disbursements
this
being
done
there
remains
as
actual
receipts
and
the
actual
disbursements
leaving
the
balance
as
already
stated
the
actual
receipts
and
disbursements
for
the
first
quarter
and
the
estimated
receipts
and
disbursements
for
the
remaining
three
quarters
of
the
current
fiscal
year
will
be
shown
in
detail
by
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
which
i
invite
your
attention
it
is
sufficient
to
say
here
that
it
is
not
believed
that
actual
results
will
exhibit
a
state
of
the
finances
less
favorable
to
the
country
than
the
estimates
of
that
officer
heretofore
submitted
while
it
is
confidently
expected
that
at
the
close
of
the
year
both
disbursements
and
debt
will
be
found
very
considerably
less
than
has
been
anticipated
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
is
a
document
of
great
interest
it
consists
of
the
military
operations
of
the
year
detailed
in
the
report
of
the
general
in
chief
the
organization
of
colored
persons
into
the
war
service
the
exchange
of
prisoners
fully
set
forth
in
the
letter
of
general
hitchcock
the
operations
under
the
act
for
enrolling
and
calling
out
the
national
forces
detailed
in
the
report
of
the
provostmarshalgeneral
the
organization
of
the
invalid
corps
and
the
operation
of
the
several
departments
of
the
quartermastergeneral
commissarygeneral
paymastergeneral
chief
of
engineers
chief
of
ordnance
and
surgeongeneral
it
has
appeared
impossible
to
make
a
valuable
summary
of
this
report
except
such
as
would
be
too
extended
for
this
place
and
hence
i
content
myself
by
asking
your
careful
attention
to
the
report
itself
the
duties
devolving
on
the
naval
branch
of
the
service
during
the
year
and
throughout
the
whole
of
this
unhappy
contest
have
been
discharged
with
fidelity
and
eminent
success
the
extensive
blockade
has
been
constantly
increasing
in
efficiency
as
the
navy
has
expanded
yet
on
so
long
a
line
it
has
so
far
been
impossible
to
entirely
suppress
illicit
trade
from
returns
received
at
the
navy
department
it
appears
that
more
than
vessels
have
been
captured
since
the
blockade
was
instituted
and
that
the
value
of
prizes
already
sent
in
for
adjudication
amounts
to
over
the
naval
force
of
the
united
states
consists
at
this
time
of
vessels
completed
and
in
the
course
of
completion
and
of
these
are
ironclad
or
armored
steamers
the
events
of
the
war
give
an
increased
interest
and
importance
to
the
navy
which
will
probably
extend
beyond
the
war
itself
the
armored
vessels
in
our
navy
completed
and
in
service
or
which
are
under
contract
and
approaching
completion
are
believed
to
exceed
in
number
those
of
any
other
power
but
while
these
may
be
relied
upon
for
harbor
defense
and
coast
service
others
of
greater
strength
and
capacity
will
be
necessary
for
cruising
purposes
and
to
maintain
our
rightful
position
on
the
ocean
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
naval
vessels
and
naval
warfare
since
the
introduction
of
steam
as
a
motive
power
for
ships
of
war
demands
either
a
corresponding
change
in
some
of
our
existing
navyyards
or
the
establishment
of
new
ones
for
the
construction
and
necessary
repair
of
modern
naval
vessels
no
inconsiderable
embarrassment
delay
and
public
injury
have
been
experienced
from
the
want
of
such
governmental
establishments
the
necessity
of
such
a
navyyard
so
furnished
at
some
suitable
place
upon
the
atlantic
seaboard
has
on
repeated
occasions
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
by
the
navy
department
and
is
again
presented
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
which
accompanies
this
communication
i
think
it
my
duty
to
invite
your
special
attention
to
this
subject
and
also
to
that
of
establishing
a
yard
and
depot
for
naval
purposes
upon
one
of
the
western
rivers
a
naval
force
has
been
created
on
those
interior
waters
and
under
many
disadvantages
within
little
more
than
two
years
exceeding
in
numbers
the
whole
naval
force
of
the
country
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
administration
satisfactory
and
important
as
have
been
the
performances
of
the
heroic
men
of
the
navy
at
this
interesting
period
they
are
scarcely
more
wonderful
than
the
success
of
our
mechanics
and
artisans
in
the
production
of
war
vessels
which
has
created
a
new
form
of
naval
power
our
country
has
advantages
superior
to
any
other
nation
in
our
resources
of
iron
and
timber
with
inexhaustible
quantities
of
fuel
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
both
and
all
available
and
in
close
proximity
to
navigable
waters
without
the
advantage
of
public
works
the
resources
of
the
nation
have
been
developed
and
its
power
displayed
in
the
construction
of
a
navy
of
such
magnitude
which
has
at
the
very
period
of
its
creation
rendered
signal
service
to
the
union
the
increase
of
the
number
of
seamen
in
the
public
service
from
men
in
the
spring
of
to
about
at
the
present
time
has
been
accomplished
without
special
legislation
or
extraordinary
bounties
to
promote
that
increase
it
has
been
found
however
that
the
operation
of
the
draft
with
the
high
bounties
paid
for
army
recruits
is
beginning
to
affect
injuriously
the
naval
service
and
will
if
not
corrected
be
likely
to
impair
its
efficiency
by
detaching
seamen
from
their
proper
vocation
and
inducing
them
to
enter
the
army
i
therefore
respectfully
suggest
that
congress
might
aid
both
the
army
and
naval
services
by
a
definite
provision
on
this
subject
which
would
at
the
same
time
be
equitable
to
the
communities
more
especially
interested
i
commend
to
your
consideration
the
suggestions
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
regard
to
the
policy
of
fostering
and
training
seamen
and
also
the
education
of
officers
and
engineers
for
the
naval
service
the
naval
academy
is
rendering
signal
service
in
preparing
midshipmen
for
the
highly
responsible
duties
which
in
after
life
they
will
be
required
to
perform
in
order
that
the
country
should
not
be
deprived
of
the
proper
quota
of
educated
officers
for
which
legal
provision
has
been
made
at
the
naval
school
the
vacancies
caused
by
the
neglect
or
omission
to
make
nominations
from
the
states
in
insurrection
have
been
filled
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
school
is
now
more
full
and
complete
than
at
any
former
period
and
in
every
respect
entitled
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
during
the
past
fiscal
year
the
financial
condition
of
the
postoffice
department
has
been
one
of
increasing
prosperity
and
i
am
gratified
in
being
able
to
state
that
the
actual
postal
revenue
has
nearly
equaled
the
entire
expenditures
the
latter
amounting
to
and
the
former
to
leaving
a
deficiency
of
but
in
the
year
immediately
preceding
the
rebellion
the
deficiency
amounted
to
the
postal
receipts
of
that
year
being
less
than
those
of
the
decrease
since
in
the
annual
amount
of
transportation
has
been
only
about
per
cent
but
the
annual
expenditure
on
account
of
the
same
has
been
reduced
per
cent
it
is
manifest
therefore
that
the
postoffice
department
may
become
selfsustaining
in
a
few
years
even
with
the
restoration
of
the
whole
servi
ce
the
international
conference
of
postal
delegates
from
the
principal
countries
of
europe
and
america
which
was
called
at
the
suggestion
of
the
postmastergeneral
met
at
paris
on
the
th
of
may
last
and
concluded
its
deliberations
on
the
th
of
june
the
principles
established
by
the
conference
as
best
adapted
to
facilitate
postal
intercourse
between
nations
and
as
the
basis
of
future
postal
conventions
inaugurate
a
general
system
of
uniform
international
charges
at
reduced
rates
of
postage
and
can
not
fail
to
produce
beneficial
results
i
refer
you
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
is
herewith
laid
before
you
for
useful
and
varied
information
in
relation
to
the
public
lands
indian
affairs
patents
pensions
and
other
matters
of
public
concern
pertaining
to
his
department
the
quantity
of
land
disposed
of
during
the
last
and
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
fiscal
years
was
acres
of
which
acres
were
sold
for
cash
acres
were
taken
up
under
the
homestead
law
and
the
residue
disposed
of
under
laws
granting
lands
for
military
bounties
for
railroad
and
other
purposes
it
also
appears
that
the
sale
of
the
public
lands
is
largely
on
the
increase
it
has
long
been
a
cherished
opinion
of
some
of
our
wisest
statesmen
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
had
a
higher
and
more
enduring
interest
in
the
early
settlement
and
substantial
cultivation
of
the
public
lands
than
in
the
amount
of
direct
revenue
to
be
derived
from
the
sale
of
them
this
opinion
has
had
a
controlling
influence
in
shaping
legislation
upon
the
subject
of
our
national
domain
i
may
cite
as
evidence
of
this
the
liberal
measures
adopted
in
reference
to
actual
settlers
the
grant
to
the
states
of
the
overflowed
lands
within
their
limits
in
order
to
their
being
reclaimed
and
rendered
fit
for
cultivation
the
grants
to
railway
companies
of
alternate
sections
of
land
upon
the
contemplated
issues
of
their
roads
which
when
completed
will
so
largely
multiply
the
facilities
for
reaching
our
distant
possessions
this
policy
has
received
its
most
signal
and
beneficent
illustration
in
the
recent
enactment
granting
homesteads
to
actual
settlers
since
the
st
day
of
january
last
the
beforementioned
quantity
of
acres
of
land
have
been
taken
up
under
its
provisions
this
fact
and
the
amount
of
sales
furnish
gratifying
evidence
of
increasing
settlement
upon
the
public
lands
notwithstanding
the
great
struggle
in
which
the
energies
of
the
nation
have
been
engaged
and
which
has
required
so
large
a
withdrawal
of
our
citizens
from
their
accustomed
pursuits
i
cordially
concur
in
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
suggesting
a
modification
of
the
act
in
favor
of
those
engaged
in
the
military
and
naval
service
of
the
united
states
i
doubt
not
that
congress
will
cheerfully
adopt
such
measures
as
will
without
essentially
changing
the
general
features
of
the
system
secure
to
the
greatest
practicable
extent
its
benefits
to
those
who
have
left
their
homes
in
the
defense
of
the
country
in
this
arduous
crisis
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
views
of
the
secretary
as
to
the
propriety
of
raising
by
appropriate
legislation
a
revenue
from
the
mineral
lands
of
the
united
states
the
measures
provided
at
your
last
session
for
the
removal
of
certain
indian
tribes
have
been
carried
into
effect
sundry
treaties
have
been
negotiated
which
will
in
due
time
be
submitted
for
the
constitutional
action
of
the
senate
they
contain
stipulations
for
extinguishing
the
possessory
rights
of
the
indians
to
large
and
valuable
tracts
of
lands
it
is
hoped
that
the
effect
of
these
treaties
will
result
in
the
establishment
of
permanent
friendly
relations
with
such
of
these
tribes
as
have
been
brought
into
frequent
and
bloody
collision
with
our
outlying
settlements
and
emigrants
sound
policy
and
our
imperative
duty
to
these
wards
of
the
government
demand
our
anxious
and
constant
attention
to
their
material
wellbeing
to
their
progress
in
the
arts
of
civilization
and
above
all
to
that
moral
training
which
under
the
blessing
of
divine
providence
will
confer
upon
them
the
elevated
and
sanctifying
influences
the
hopes
and
consolations
of
the
christian
faith
i
suggested
in
my
last
annual
message
the
propriety
of
remodeling
our
indian
system
subsequent
events
have
satisfied
me
of
its
necessity
the
details
set
forth
in
the
report
of
the
secretary
evince
the
urgent
need
for
immediate
legislative
action
i
commend
the
benevolent
institutions
established
or
patronized
by
the
government
in
this
district
to
your
generous
and
fostering
care
the
attention
of
congress
during
the
last
session
was
engaged
to
some
extent
with
a
proposition
for
enlarging
the
water
communication
between
the
mississippi
river
and
the
northeastern
seaboard
which
proposition
however
failed
for
the
time
since
then
upon
a
call
of
the
greatest
respectability
a
convention
has
been
held
at
chicago
upon
the
same
subject
a
summary
of
whose
views
is
contained
in
a
memorial
addressed
to
the
president
and
congress
and
which
i
now
have
the
honor
to
lay
before
you
that
this
interest
is
one
which
ere
long
will
force
its
own
way
i
do
not
entertain
a
doubt
while
it
is
submitted
entirely
to
your
wisdom
as
to
what
can
be
done
now
augmented
interest
is
given
to
this
subject
by
the
actual
commencement
of
work
upon
the
pacific
railroad
under
auspices
so
favorable
to
rapid
progress
and
completion
the
enlarged
navigation
becomes
a
palpable
need
to
the
great
road
i
transmit
the
second
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
of
the
department
of
agriculture
asking
your
attention
to
the
developments
in
that
vital
interest
of
the
nation
when
congress
assembled
a
year
ago
the
war
had
already
lasted
nearly
twenty
months
and
there
had
been
many
conflicts
on
both
land
and
sea
with
varying
results
the
rebellion
had
been
pressed
back
into
reduced
limits
yet
the
tone
of
public
feeling
and
opinion
at
home
and
abroad
was
not
satisfactory
with
other
signs
the
popular
elections
then
just
past
indicated
uneasiness
among
ourselves
while
amid
much
that
was
cold
and
menacing
the
kindest
words
coming
from
europe
were
uttered
in
accents
of
pity
that
we
were
too
blind
to
surrender
a
hopeless
cause
our
commerce
was
suffering
greatly
by
a
few
armed
vessels
built
upon
and
furnished
from
foreign
shores
and
we
were
threatened
with
such
additions
from
the
same
quarter
as
would
sweep
our
trade
from
the
sea
and
raise
our
blockade
we
had
failed
to
elicit
from
european
governments
anything
hopeful
upon
this
subject
the
preliminary
emancipation
proclamation
issued
in
september
was
running
its
assigned
period
to
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
a
month
later
the
final
proclamation
came
including
the
announcement
that
colored
men
of
suitable
condition
would
be
received
into
the
war
service
the
policy
of
emancipation
and
of
employing
black
soldiers
gave
to
the
future
a
new
aspect
about
which
hope
and
fear
and
doubt
contended
in
uncertain
conflict
according
to
our
political
system
as
a
matter
of
civil
administration
the
general
government
had
no
lawful
power
to
effect
emancipation
in
any
state
and
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
hoped
that
the
rebellion
could
be
suppressed
without
resorting
to
it
as
a
military
measure
it
was
all
the
while
deemed
possible
that
the
necessity
for
it
might
come
and
that
if
it
should
the
crisis
of
the
contest
would
then
be
presented
it
came
and
as
was
anticipated
it
was
followed
by
dark
and
doubtful
days
eleven
months
having
now
passed
we
are
permitted
to
take
another
review
the
rebel
borders
are
pressed
still
farther
back
and
by
the
complete
opening
of
the
mississippi
the
country
dominated
by
the
rebellion
is
divided
into
distinct
parts
with
no
practical
communication
between
them
tennessee
and
arkansas
have
been
substantially
cleared
of
insurgent
control
and
influential
citizens
in
each
owners
of
slaves
and
advocates
of
slavery
at
the
beginning
of
the
rebellion
now
declare
openly
for
emancipation
in
their
respective
states
of
those
states
not
included
in
the
emancipation
proclamation
maryland
and
missouri
neither
of
which
three
years
ago
would
tolerate
any
restraint
upon
the
extension
of
slavery
into
new
territories
only
dispute
now
as
to
the
best
mode
of
removing
it
within
their
own
limits
of
those
who
were
slaves
at
the
beginning
of
the
rebellion
full
are
now
in
the
united
states
military
service
about
onehalf
of
which
number
actually
bear
arms
in
the
ranks
thus
giving
the
double
advantage
of
taking
so
much
labor
from
the
insurgent
cause
and
supplying
the
places
which
otherwise
must
be
filled
with
so
many
white
men
so
far
as
tested
it
is
difficult
to
say
they
are
not
as
good
soldiers
as
any
no
servile
insurrection
or
tendency
to
violence
or
cruelty
has
marked
the
measures
of
emancipation
and
arming
the
blacks
these
measures
have
been
much
discussed
in
foreign
countries
and
contemporary
with
such
discussion
the
tone
of
public
sentiment
there
is
much
improved
at
home
the
same
measures
have
been
fully
discussed
supported
criticised
and
denounced
and
the
annual
elections
following
are
highly
encouraging
to
those
whose
official
duty
it
is
to
bear
the
country
through
this
great
trial
thus
we
have
the
new
reckoning
the
crisis
which
threatened
to
divide
the
friends
of
the
union
is
past
looking
now
to
the
present
and
future
and
with
reference
to
a
resumption
of
the
national
authority
within
the
states
wherein
that
authority
has
been
suspended
i
have
thought
fit
to
issue
a
proclamation
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
transmitted
on
examination
of
this
proclamation
it
will
appear
as
is
believed
that
nothing
will
be
attempted
beyond
what
is
amply
justified
by
the
constitution
true
the
form
of
an
oath
is
given
but
no
man
is
coerced
to
take
it
the
man
is
only
promised
a
pardon
in
case
he
voluntarily
takes
the
oath
the
constitution
authorizes
the
executive
to
grant
or
withhold
the
pardon
at
his
own
absolute
discretion
and
this
includes
the
power
to
grant
on
terms
as
is
fully
established
by
judicial
and
other
authorities
it
is
also
proffered
that
if
in
any
of
the
states
named
a
state
government

shall
be
in
the
mode
prescribed
set
up
such
government
shall
be
recognized
and
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
and
that
under
it
the
state
shall
on
the
constitutional
conditions
be
protected
against
invasion
and
domestic
violence
the
constitutional
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
guarantee
to
every
state
in
the
union
a
republican
form
of
government
and
to
protect
the
state
in
the
cases
stated
is
explicit
and
full
but
why
tender
the
benefits
of
this
provision
only
to
a
state
government
set
up
in
this
particular
way
this
section
of
the
constitution
contemplates
a
case
wherein
the
element
within
a
state
favorable
to
republican
government
in
the
union
may
be
too
feeble
for
an
opposite
and
hostile
element
external
to
or
even
within
the
state
and
such
are
precisely
the
cases
with
which
we
are
now
dealing
an
attempt
to
guarantee
and
protect
a
revived
state
government
constructed
in
whole
or
in
preponderating
part
from
the
very
element
against
whose
hostility
and
violence
it
is
to
be
protected
is
simply
absurd
there
must
be
a
test
by
which
to
separate
the
opposing
elements
so
as
to
build
only
from
the
sound
and
that
test
is
a
sufficiently
liberal
one
which
accepts
as
sound
whoever
will
make
a
sworn
recantation
of
his
former
unsoundness
but
if
it
be
proper
to
require
as
a
test
of
admission
to
the
political
body
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
union
under
it
why
also
to
the
laws
and
proclamations
in
regard
to
slavery
those
laws
and
proclamations
were
enacted
and
put
forth
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
in
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
to
give
them
their
fullest
effect
there
had
to
be
a
pledge
for
their
maintenance
in
my
judgment
they
have
aided
and
will
further
aid
the
cause
for
which
they
were
intended
to
now
abandon
them
would
be
not
only
to
relinquish
a
lever
of
power
but
would
also
be
a
cruel
and
an
astounding
breach
of
faith
i
may
add
at
this
point
that
while
i
remain
in
my
present
position
i
shall
not
attempt
to
retract
or
modify
the
emancipation
proclamation
nor
shall
i
return
to
slavery
any
person
who
is
free
by
the
terms
of
that
proclamation
or
by
any
of
the
acts
of
congress
for
these
and
other
reasons
it
is
thought
best
that
support
of
these
measures
shall
be
included
in
the
oath
and
it
is
believed
the
executive
may
lawfully
claim
it
in
return
for
pardon
and
restoration
of
forfeited
rights
which
he
has
clear
constitutional
power
to
withhold
altogether
or
grant
upon
the
terms
which
he
shall
deem
wisest
for
the
public
interest
it
should
be
observed
also
that
this
part
of
the
oath
is
subject
to
the
modifying
and
abrogating
power
of
legislation
and
supreme
judicial
decision
the
proposed
acquiescence
of
the
national
executive
in
any
reasonable
temporary
state
arrangement
for
the
freed
people
is
made
with
the
view
of
possibly
modifying
the
confusion
and
destitution
which
must
at
best
attend
all
classes
by
a
total
revolution
of
labor
throughout
whole
states
it
is
hoped
that
the
already
deeply
afflicted
people
in
those
states
may
be
somewhat
more
ready
to
give
up
the
cause
of
their
affliction
if
to
this
extent
this
vital
matter
be
left
to
themselves
while
no
power
of
the
national
executive
to
prevent
an
abuse
is
abridged
by
the
proposition
the
suggestion
in
the
proclamation
as
to
maintaining
the
political
framework
of
the
states
on
what
is
called
reconstruction
is
made
in
the
hope
that
it
may
do
good
without
danger
of
harm
it
will
save
labor
and
avoid
great
confusion
but
why
any
proclamation
now
upon
this
subject
this
question
is
beset
with
the
conflicting
views
that
the
step
might
be
delayed
too
long
or
be
taken
too
soon
in
some
states
the
elements
for
resumption
seem
ready
for
action
but
remain
inactive
apparently
for
want
of
a
rallying
pointa
plan
of
action
why
shall
a
adopt
the
plan
of

rather
than
b
that
of
a
and
if
a
and
b
should
agree
how
can
they
know
but
that
the
general
government
here
will
reject
their
plan
by
the
proclamation
a
plan
is
presented
which
may
be
accepted
by
them
as
a
rallying
point
and
which
they
are
assured
in
advance
will
not
be
rejected
here
this
may
bring
them
to
act
sooner
than
they
otherwise
would
the
objections
to
a
premature
presentation
of
a
plan
by
the
national
executive
consist
in
the
danger
of
committals
on
points
which
could
be
more
safely
left
to
further
developments
care
has
been
taken
to
so
shape
the
document
as
to
avoid
embarrassments
from
this
source
saying
that
on
certain
terms
certain
classes
will
be
pardoned
with
rights
restored
it
is
not
said
that
other
classes
or
other
terms
will
never
be
in
included
saying
specified
way
it
is
said
that
reconstruction
will
be
accepted
if
presented
in
a
not
said
it
will
never
be
accepted
in
any
other
way
the
movements
by
state
action
for
emancipation
in
several
of
the
states
not
included
in
the
emancipation
proclamation
are
matters
of
profound
gratulation
and
while
i
do
not
repeat
in
detail
what
i
have
heretofore
so
earnestly
urged
upon
this
subject
my
general
views
and
feelings
remain
unchanged
and
i
trust
that
congress
will
omit
no
fair
opportunity
of
aiding
these
important
steps
to
a
great
consummation
in
the
midst
of
other
cares
however
important
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
war
power
is
still
our
main
reliance
to
that
power
alone
can
we
look
yet
for
a
time
to
give
confidence
to
the
people
in
the
contested
regions
that
the
insurgent
power
will
not
again
overrun
them
until
that
confidence
shall
be
established
little
can
be
done
anywhere
for
what
is
called
reconstruction
hence
our
chiefest
care
must
still
be
directed
to
the
army
and
navy
who
have
thus
far
borne
their
harder
part
so
nobly
and
well
and
it
may
be
esteemed
fortunate
that
in
giving
the
greatest
efficiency
to
these
indispensable
arms
we
do
also
honorably
recognize
the
gallant
men
from
commander
to
sentinel
who
compose
them
and
to
whom
more
than
to
others
the
world
must
stand
indebted
for
the
home
of
freedom
disenthralled
regenerated
enlarged
and
perpetuated

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
since
your
last
annual
assembling
another
year
of
health
and
bountiful
harvests
has
passed
and
while
it
has
not
pleased
the
almighty
to
bless
us
with
a
return
of
peace
we
can
but
press
on
guided
by
the
best
light
he
gives
us
trusting
that
in
his
own
good
time
and
wise
way
all
will
yet
be
well
the
correspondence
touching
foreign
affairs
which
has
taken
place
during
the
last
year
is
herewith
submitted
in
virtual
compliance
with
a
request
to
that
effect
made
by
the
house
of
representatives
near
the
close
of
the
last
session
of
congress
if
the
condition
of
our
relations
with
other
nations
is
less
gratifying
than
it
has
usually
been
at
former
periods
it
is
certainly
more
satisfactory
than
a
nation
so
unhappily
distracted
as
we
are
might
reasonably
have
apprehended
in
the
month
of
june
last
there
were
some
grounds
to
expect
that
the
maritime
powers
which
at
the
beginning
of
our
domestic
difficulties
so
unwisely
and
unnecessarily
as
we
think
recognized
the
insurgents
as
a
belligerent
would
soon
recede
from
that
position
which
has
proved
only
less
injurious
to
themselves
than
to
our
own
country
but
the
temporary
reverses
which
afterwards
befell
the
national
arms
and
which
were
exaggerated
by
our
own
disloyal
citizens
abroad
have
hitherto
delayed
that
act
of
simple
justice
the
civil
war
which
has
so
radically
changed
for
the
moment
the
occupations
and
habits
of
the
american
people
has
necessarily
disturbed
the
social
condition
and
affected
very
deeply
the
prosperity
of
the
nations
with
which
we
have
carried
on
a
commerce
that
has
been
steadily
increasing
throughout
a
period
of
half
a
century
it
has
at
the
same
time
excited
political
ambitions
and
apprehensions
which
have
produced
a
profound
agitation
throughout
the
civilized
world
in
this
unusual
agitation
we
have
forborne
from
taking
part
in
any
controversy
between
foreign
states
and
between
parties
or
factions
in
such
states
we
have
attempted
no
propagandism
and
acknowledged
no
revolution
but
we
have
left
to
every
nation
the
exclusive
conduct
and
management
of
its
own
affairs
our
struggle
has
been
of
course
contemplated
by
foreign
nations
with
reference
less
to
its
own
merits
than
to
its
supposed
and
often
exaggerated
effects
and
consequences
resulting
to
those
nations
themselves
nevertheless
complaint
on
the
part
of
this
government
even
if
it
were
just
would
certainly
be
unwise
the
treaty
with
great
britain
for
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
has
been
put
into
operation
with
a
good
prospect
of
complete
success
it
is
an
occasion
of
special
pleasure
to
acknowledge
that
the
execution
of
it
on
the
part
of
her
majestys
government
has
been
marked
with
a
jealous
respect
for
the
authority
of
the
united
states
and
the
rights
of
their
moral
and
loyal
citizens
the
convention
with
hanover
for
the
abolition
of
the
stade
dues
has
been
carried
into
full
effect
under
the
act
of
congress
for
that
purpose
a
blockade
of
miles
of
seacoast
could
not
be
established
and
vigorously
enforced
in
a
season
of
great
commercial
activity
like
the
present
without
committing
occasional
mistakes
and
inflicting
unintentional
injuries
upon
foreign
nations
and
their
subjects
a
civil
war
occurring
in
a
country
where
foreigners
reside
and
carry
on
trade
under
treaty
stipulations
is
necessarily
fruitful
of
complaints
of
the
violation
of
neutral
rights
all
such
collisions
tend
to
excite
misapprehensions
and
possibly
to
produce
mutual
reclamations
between
nations
which
have
a
common
interest
in
preserving
peace
and
friendship
in
clear
cases
of
these
kinds
i
have
so
far
as
possible
heard
and
redressed
complaints
which
have
been
presented
by
friendly
powers
there
is
still
however
a
large
and
an
augmenting
number
of
doubtful
cases
upon
which
the
government
is
unable
to
agree
with
the
governments
whose
protection
is
demanded
by
the
claimants
there
are
moreover
many
cases
in
which
the
united
states
or
their
citizens
suffer
wrongs
from
the
naval
or
military
authorities
of
foreign
nations
which
the
governments
of
those
states
are
not
at
once
prepared
to
redress
i
have
proposed
to
some
of
the
foreign
states
thus
interested
mutual
conventions
to
examine
and
adjust
such
complaints
this
proposition
has
been
made
especially
to
great
britain
to
france
to
spain
and
to
prussia
in
each
case
it
has
been
kindly
received
but
has
not
yet
been
formally
adopted
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
recommend
an
appropriation
in
behalf
of
the
owners
of
the
norwegian
bark
admiral
p
tordenskiold
which
vessel
was
in
may
prevented
by
the
commander
of
the
blockading
force
off
charleston
from
leaving
that
port
with
cargo
notwithstanding
a
similar
privilege
had
shortly
before
been
granted
to
an
english
vessel
i
have
directed
the
secretary
of
state
to
cause
the
papers
in
the
case
to
be
communicated
to
the
proper
committees
applications
have
been
made
to
me
by
many
free
americans
of
african
descent
to
favor
their
emigration
with
a
view
to
such
colonization
as
was
contemplated
in
recent
acts
of
congress
other
parties
at
home
and
abroadsome
from
interested
motives
others
upon
patriotic
considerations
and
still
others
influenced
by
philanthropic
sentimentshave
suggested
similar
measures
while
on
the
other
hand
several
of
the
spanish
american
republics
have
protested
against
the
sending
of
such
colonies
to
their
respective
territories
under
these
circumstances
i
have
declined
to
move
any
such
colony
to
any
state
without
first
obtaining
the
consent
of
its
government
with
an
agreement
on
its
part
to
receive
and
protect
such
emigrants
in
all
the
rights
of
freemen
and
i
have
at
the
same
time
offered
to
the
several
states
situated
within
the
tropics
or
having
colonies
there
to
negotiate
with
them
subject
to
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
to
favor
the
voluntary
emigration
of
persons
of
that
class
to
their
respective
territories
upon
conditions
which
shall
be
equal
just
and
humane
liberia
and
hayti
are
as
yet
the
only
countries
to
which
colonists
of
african
descent
from
here
could
go
with
certainty
of
being
received
and
adopted
as
citizens
and
i
regret
to
say
such
persons
contemplating
colonization
do
not
seem
so
willing
to
migrate
to
those
countries
as
to
some
others
nor
so
willing
as
i
think
their
interest
demands
i
believe
however
opinion
among
them
in
this
respect
is
improving
and
that
ere
long
there
will
be
an
augmented
and
considerable
migration
to
both
these
countries
from
the
united
states
the
new
commercial
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
sultan
of
turkey
has
been
carried
into
execution
a
commercial
and
consular
treaty
has
been
negotiated
subject
to
the
senates
consent
with
liberia
and
a
similar
negotiation
is
now
pending
with
the
republic
of
hayti
a
considerable
improvement
of
the
national
commerce
is
expected
to
result
from
these
measures
our
relations
with
great
britain
france
spain
portugal
russia
prussia
denmark
sweden
austria
the
netherlands
italy
rome
and
the
other
european
states
remain
undisturbed
very
favorable
relations
also
continue
to
be
maintained
with
turkey
morocco
china
and
japan
during
the
last
year
there
has
not
only
been
no
change
of
our
previous
relations
with
the
independent
states
of
our
own
continent
but
more
friendly
sentiments
than
have
heretofore
existed
are
believed
to
be
entertained
by
these
neighbors
whose
safety
and
progress
are
so
intimately
connected
with
our
own
this
statement
especially
applies
to
mexico
nicaragua
costa
rica
honduras
peru
and
chile
the
commission
under
the
convention
with
the
republic
of
new
granada
closed
its
session
without
having
audited
and
passed
upon
all
the
claims
which
were
submitted
to
it
a
proposition
is
pending
to
revive
the
convention
that
it
may
be
able
to
do
more
complete
justice
the
joint
commission
between
the
united
states
and
the
republic
of
costa
rica
has
completed
its
labors
and
submitted
its
report
i
have
favored
the
project
for
connecting
the
united
states
with
europe
by
an
atlantic
telegraph
and
a
similar
project
to
extend
the
telegraph
from
san
francisco
to
connect
by
a
pacific
telegraph
with
the
line
which
is
being
extended
across
the
russian
empire
the
territories
of
the
united
states
with
unimportant
exceptions
have
remained
undisturbed
by
the
civil
war
and
they
are
exhibiting
such
evidence
of
prosperity
as
justifies
an
expectation
that
some
of
them
will
soon
be
in
a
condition
to
be
organized
as
states
and
be
constitutionally
admitted
into
the
federal
union
the
immense
mineral
resources
of
some
of
those
territories
ought
to
be
developed
as
rapidly
as
possible
every
step
in
that
direction
would
have
a
tendency
to
improve
the
revenues
of
the
government
and
diminish
the
burdens
of
the
people
it
is
worthy
of
your
serious
consideration
whether
some
extraordinary
measures
to
promote
that
end
can
not
be
adopted
the
means
which
suggests
itself
as
most
likely
to
be
effective
is
a
scientific
exploration
of
the
mineral
regions
in
those
territories
with
a
view
to
the
publication
of
its
results
at
home
and
in
foreign
countriesresults
which
can
not
fail
to
be
auspicious
the
condition
of
the
finances
will
claim
your
most
diligent
consideration
the
vast
expenditures
incident
to
the
military
and
naval
operations
required
for
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
have
hitherto
been
met
with
a
promptitude
and
certainty
unusual
in
similar
circumstances
and
the
public
credit
has
been
fully
maintained
the
continuance
of
the
war
however
and
the
increased
disbursements
made
necessary
by
the
augmented
forces
now
in
the
field
demand
your
best
reflections
as
to
the
best
modes
of
providing
the
necessary
revenue
without
injury
to
business
and
with
the
least
possible
burdens
upon
labor
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
by
the
banks
soon
after
the
commencement
of
your
last
session
made
large
issues
of
united
states
notes
unavoidable
in
no
other
way
could
the
payment
of
the
troops
and
the
satisfaction
of
other
just
demands
be
so
economically
or
so
well
provided
for
the
judicious
legislation
of
congress
securing
the
receivability
of
these
n
otes
for
loans
and
internal
duties
and
making
them
a
legal
tender
for
other
debts
has
made
them
an
universal
currency
and
has
satisfied
partially
at
least
and
for
the
time
the
longfelt
want
of
an
uniform
circulating
medium
saving
thereby
to
the
people
immense
sums
in
discounts
and
exchanges
a
return
to
specie
payments
however
at
the
earliest
period
compatible
with
due
regard
to
all
interests
concerned
should
ever
be
kept
in
view
fluctuations
in
the
value
of
currency
are
always
injurious
and
to
reduce
these
fluctuations
to
the
lowest
possible
point
will
always
be
a
leading
purpose
in
wise
legislation
convertibility
prompt
and
certain
convertibility
into
coin
is
generally
acknowledged
to
be
the
best
and
surest
safeguard
against
them
and
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
a
circulation
of
united
states
notes
payable
in
coin
and
sufficiently
large
for
the
wants
of
the
people
can
be
permanently
usefully
and
safely
maintained
is
there
then
any
other
mode
in
which
the
necessary
provision
for
the
public
wants
can
be
made
and
the
great
advantages
of
a
safe
and
uniform
currency
secured
i
know
of
none
which
promises
so
certain
results
and
is
at
the
same
time
so
unobjectionable
as
the
organization
of
banking
associations
under
a
general
act
of
congress
well
guarded
in
its
provisions
to
such
associations
the
government
might
furnish
circulating
notes
on
the
security
of
united
states
bonds
deposited
in
the
treasury
these
notes
prepared
under
the
supervision
of
proper
officers
being
uniform
in
appearance
and
security
and
convertible
always
into
coin
would
at
once
protect
labor
against
the
evils
of
a
vicious
currency
and
facilitate
commerce
by
cheap
and
safe
exchanges
a
moderate
reservation
from
the
interest
on
the
bonds
would
compensate
the
united
states
for
the
preparation
and
distribution
of
the
notes
and
a
general
supervision
of
the
system
and
would
lighten
the
burden
of
that
part
of
the
public
debt
employed
as
securities
the
public
credit
moreover
would
be
greatly
improved
and
the
negotiation
of
new
loans
greatly
facilitated
by
the
steady
market
demand
for
government
bonds
which
the
adoption
of
the
proposed
system
would
create
it
is
an
additional
recommendation
of
the
measure
of
considerable
weight
in
my
judgment
that
it
would
reconcile
as
far
as
possible
all
existing
interests
by
the
opportunity
offered
to
existing
institutions
to
reorganize
under
the
act
substituting
only
the
secured
uniform
national
circulation
for
the
local
and
various
circulation
secured
and
unsecured
now
issued
by
them
the
receipts
into
the

all
sources
including

and

the

upon
any
principle
which
would
admit
of
its
being
much
shorter
than
the
reports
themselves
i
therefore
content
myself
with
laying
the
reports
before
you
and
asking
your
attention
to
them
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
report
a
decided
improvement
in
the
financial
condition
of
the
postoffice
department
as
compared
with
several
preceding
years
the
receipts
for
the
fiscal
year
amounted
to
which
embraced
the
revenue
from
all
the
states
of
the
union
for
three
quarters
of
that
year
notwithstanding
the
cessation
of
revenue
from
the
socalled
seceded
states
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
increase
of
the
correspondence
of
the
loyal
states
has
been
sufficient
to
produce
a
revenue
during
the
same
year
of
being
only
less
than
was
derived
from
all
the
states
of
the
union
during
the
previous
year
the
expenditures
show
a
still
more
favorable
result
the
amount
expended
in
was
for
the
last
year
the
amount
has
been
reduced
to
showing
a
decrease
of
about
in
the
expenditures
as
compared
with
the
preceding
year
and
about
as
compared
with
the
fiscal
year
the
deficiency
in
the
department
for
the
previous
year
was
for
the
last
fiscal
year
it
was
reduced
to
these
favorable
results
are
in
part
owing
to
the
cessation
of
mail
service
in
the
insurrectionary
states
and
in
part
to
a
careful
review
of
all
expenditures
in
that
department
in
the
interest
of
economy
the
efficiency
of
the
postal
service
it
is
believed
has
also
been
much
improved
the
postmastergeneral
has
also
opened
a
correspondence
through
the
department
of
state
with
foreign
governments
proposing
a
convention
of
postal
representatives
for
the
purpose
of
simplifying
the
rates
of
foreign
postage
and
to
expedite
the
foreign
mails
this
proposition
equally
important
to
our
adopted
citizens
and
to
the
commercial
interests
of
this
country
has
been
favorably
entertained
and
agreed
to
by
all
the
governments
from
whom
replies
have
been
received
i
ask
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
suggestions
of
the
postmastergeneral
in
his
report
respecting
the
further
legislation
required
in
his
opinion
for
the
benefit
of
the
postal
service
the
secretary
of
the
interior
reports
as
follows
in
regard
to
the
public
lands
the
public
lands
have
ceased
to
be
a
source
of
revenue
from
the
st
july
to
the
th
september
the
entire
cash
receipts
from
the
sale
of
lands
were
a
sum
much
less
than
the
expenses
of
our
land
system
during
the
same
period
the
homestead
law
which
will
take
effect
on
the
st
of
january
next
offers
such
inducements
to
settlers
that
sales
for
cash
can
not
be
expected
to
an
extent
sufficient
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
general
land
office
and
the
cost
of
surveying
and
bringing
the
land
into
market
the
discrepancy
between
the
sum
here
stated
as
arising
from
the
sales
of
the
public
lands
and
the
sum
derived
from
the
same
source
as
reported
from
the
treasury
department
arises
as
i
understand
from
the
fact
that
the
periods
of
time
though
apparently
were
not
really
coincident
at
the
beginning
point
the
treasury
report
including
a
considerable
sum
now
which
had
previously
been
reported
from
the
interior
sufficiently
large
to
greatly
overreach
the
sum
derived
from
the
three
months
now
reported
upon
by
the
interior
and
not
by
the
treasury
the
indian
tribes
upon
our
frontiers
have
during
the
past
year
manifested
a
spirit
of
insubordination
and
at
several
points
have
engaged
in
open
hostilities
against
the
white
settlements
in
their
vicinity
the
tribes
occupying
the
indian
country
south
of
kansas
renounced
their
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
entered
into
treaties
with
the
insurgents
those
who
remained
loyal
to
the
united
states
were
driven
from
the
country
the
chief
of
the
cherokees
has
visited
this
city
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
the
former
relations
of
the
tribe
with
the
united
states
he
alleges
that
they
were
constrained
by
superior
force
to
enter
into
treaties
with
the
insurgents
and
that
the
united
states
neglected
to
furnish
the
protection
which
their
treaty
stipulations
required
in
the
month
of
august
last
the
sioux
indians
in
minnesota
attacked
the
settlements
in
their
vicinity
with
extreme
ferocity
killing
indiscriminately
men
women
and
children
this
attack
was
wholly
unexpected
and
therefore
no
means
of
defense
had
been
prodded
it
is
estimated
that
not
less
than
persons
were
killed
by
the
indians
and
a
large
amount
of
property
was
destroyed
how
this
outbreak
was
induced
is
not
definitely
known
and
suspicions
which
may
be
unjust
need
not
to
be
stated
information
was
received
by
the
indian
bureau
from
different
sources
about
the
time
hostilities
were
commenced
that
a
simultaneous
attack
was
to
be
made
upon
the
white
settlements
by
all
the
tribes
between
the
mississippi
river
and
the
rocky
mountains
the
state
of
minnesota
has
suffered
great
injury
from
this
indian
war
a
large
portion
of
her
territory
has
been
depopulated
and
a
severe
loss
has
been
sustained
by
the
destruction
of
property
the
people
of
that
state
manifest
much
anxiety
for
the
removal
of
the
tribes
beyond
the
limits
of
the
state
as
a
guaranty
against
future
hostilities
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
will
furnish
full
details
i
submit
for
your
especial
consideration
whether
our
indian
system
shall
not
be
remodeled
many
wise
and
good
men
have
impressed
me
with
the
belief
that
this
can
be
profitably
done
i
submit
a
statement
of
the
proceedings
of
commissioners
which
shows
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
enterprise
of
constructing
the
pacific
railroad
and
this
suggests
the
earliest
completion
of
this
road
and
also
the
favorable
action
of
congress
upon
the
projects
now
pending
before
them
for
enlarging
the
capacities
of
the
great
canals
in
new
york
and
illinois
as
being
of
vital
and
rapidly
increasing
importance
to
the
whole
nation
and
especially
to
the
vast
interior
region
hereinafter
to
be
noticed
at
some
greater
length
i
purpose
having
prepared
and
laid
before
you
at
an
early
day
s
ome
interesting
and
valuable
statistical
information
upon
this
subject
the
military
and
commercial
importance
of
enlarging
the
illinois
and
michigan
canal
and
improving
the
illinois
river
is
presented
in
the
report
of
colonel
webster
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
now
transmitted
to
congress
i
respectfully
ask
attention
to
it
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
congress
of
the
th
of
may
last
i
have
caused
the
department
of
agriculture
of
the
united
states
to
be
organized
the
commissioner
informs
me
that
within
the
period
of
a
few
months
this
department
has
established
an
extensive
system
of
correspondence
and
exchanges
both
at
home
and
abroad
which
promises
to
effect
highly
beneficial
results
in
the
development
of
a
correct
knowledge
of
recent
improvements
in
agriculture
in
the
introduction
of
new
products
and
in
the
collection
of
the
agricultural
statistics
of
the
different
states
also
that
it
will
soon
be
prepared
to
distribute
largely
seeds
cereals
plants
and
cuttings
and
has
already
published
and
liberally
diffused
much
valuable
information
in
anticipation
of
a
more
elaborate
report
which
will
in
due
time
be
furnished
embracing
some
valuable
tests
in
chemical
science
now
in
progress
in
the
laboratory
the
creation
of
this
department
was
for
the
more
immediate
benefit
of
a
large
class
of
our
most
valuable
citizens
and
i
trust
that
the
liberal
basis
upon
which
it
has
been
organized
will
not
only
meet
your
approbation
but
that
it
will
realize
at
no
distant
day
all
the
fondest
anticipations
of
its
most
sanguine
friends
and
become
the
fruitful
source
of
advantage
to
all
our
people
on
the
d
day
of
september
last
a
proclamation
was
issued
by
the
executive
a
copy
of
which
is
herewith
submitted
in
accordance
with
the
purpose
expressed
in
the
second
paragraph
of
that
paper
i
now
respectfully
recall
your
attention
to
what
may
be
called
compensated
emancipation
a
nation
may
be
said
to
consist
of
its
territory
its
people
and
its
laws
the
territory
is
the
only
part
which
is
of
certain
durability
one
generation
passeth
away
and
another
generation
cometh
but
the
earth
abideth
forever
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
duly
consider
and
estimate
this
everenduring
part
that
portion
of
the
earths
surface
which
is
owned
and
inhabited
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
is
well
adapted
to
be
the
home
of
one
national
family
and
it
is
not
well
adapted
for
two
or
more
its
vast
extent
and
its
variety
of
climate
and
productions
are
of
advantage
in
this
age
for
one
people
whatever
they
might
have
been
in
former
ages
steam
telegraphs
and
intelligence
have
brought
these
to
be
an
advantageous
combination
for
one
united
people
in
the
inaugural
address
i
briefly
pointed
out
the
total
inadequacy
of
disunion
as
a
remedy
for
the
differences
between
the
people
of
the
two
sections
i
did
so
in
language
which
i
can
not
improve
and
which
therefore
i
beg
to
repeat
one
section
of
our
country
believes
slavery
is
right
and
ought
to
be
extended
while
the
other
believes
it
is
wrong
and
ought
not
to
be
extended
this
is
the
only
substantial
dispute
the
fugitiveslave
clause
of
the
constitution
and
the
law
for
the
suppression
of
the
foreign
slave
trade
are
each
as
well
enforced
perhaps
as
any
law
can
ever
be
in
a
community
where
the
moral
sense
of
the
people
imperfectly
supports
the
law
itself
the
great
body
of
the
people
abide
by
the
dry
legal
obligation
in
both
cases
and
a
few
break
over
in
each
this
i
think
can
not
be
perfectly
cured
and
it
would
be
worse
in
both
cases
after
the
separation
of
the
sections
than
before
the
foreign
slave
trade
now
imperfectly
suppressed
would
be
ultimately
revived
without
restriction
in
one
section
while
fugitive
slaves
now
only
partially
surrendered
would
not
be
surrendered
at
all
by
the
other
physically
speaking
we
can
not
separate
we
can
not
remove
our
respective
sections
from
each
other
nor
build
an
impassable
wall
between
them
a
husband
and
wife
may
be
divorced
and
go
out
of
the
presence
and
beyond
the
reach
of
each
other
but
the
different
parts
of
our
country
can
not
do
this
they
can
not
but
remain
face
to
face
and
intercourse
either
amicable
or
hostile
must
continue
between
them
is
it
possible
then
to
make
that
intercourse
more
advantageous
or
more
satisfactory
after
separation
than
before
can
aliens
make
treaties
easier
than
friends
can
make
laws
can
treaties
be
more
faithfully
enforced
between
aliens
than
laws
can
among
friends
suppose
you
go
to
war
you
can
not
fight
always
and
when
after
much
loss
on
both
sides
and
no
gain
on
either
you
cease
fighting
the
identical
old
questions
as
to
terms
of
intercourse
are
again
upon
you
there
is
no
line
straight
or
crooked
suitable
for
a
national
boundary
upon
which
to
divide
trace
through
from
east
to
west
upon
the
line
between
the
free
and
slave
country
and
we
shall
find
a
little
more
than
onethird
of
its
length
are
rivers
easy
to
be
crossed
and
populated
or
soon
to
be
populated
thickly
upon
both
sides
while
nearly
all
its
remaining
length
are
merely
surveyors
lines
over
which
people
may
walk
back
and
forth
without
any
consciousness
of
their
presence
no
part
of
this
line
can
be
made
any
more
difficult
to
pass
by
writing
it
down
on
paper
or
parchment
as
a
national
boundary
the
fact
of
separation
if
it
comes
gives
up
on
the
part
of
the
seceding
section
the
fugitiveslave
clause
along
with
all
other
constitutional
obligations
upon
the
section
seceded
from
while
i
should
expect
no
treaty
stipulation
would
ever
be
made
to
take
its
place
but
there
is
another
difficulty
the
great
interior
region
bounded
east
by
the
alleghanies
north
by
the
british
dominions
west
by
the
rocky
mountains
and
south
by
the
line
along
which
the
culture
of
corn
and
cotton
meets
and
which
includes
part
of
virginia
part
of
tennessee
all
of
kentucky
ohio
indiana
michigan
wisconsin
illinois
missouri
kansas
iowa
minnesota
and
the
territories
of
dakota
nebraska
and
part
of
colorado
already
has
above
people
and
will
have
within
fifty
years
if
not
prevented
by
any
political
folly
or
mistake
it
contains
more
than
onethird
of
the
country
owned
by
the
united
statescertainly
more
than
square
miles
once
half
as
populous
as
massachusetts
already
is
it
would
have
more
than
people
a
glance
at
the
map
shows
that
territorially
speaking
it
is
the
great
body
of
the
republic
the
other
parts
are
but
marginal
borders
to
it
the
magnificent
region
sloping
west
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
pacific
being
the
deepest
and
also
the
richest
in
undeveloped
resources
in
the
production
of
provisions
grains
grasses
and
all
which
proceed
from
them
this
great
interior
region
is
naturally
one
of
the
most
important
in
the
world
ascertain
from
the
statistics
the
small
proportion
of
the
region
which
has
as
yet
been
brought
into
cultivation
and
also
the
large
and
rapidly
increasing
amount
of
its
products
and
we
shall
be
overwhelmed
with
the
magnitude
of
the
prospect
presented
and
yet
this
region
has
no
seacoasttouches
no
ocean
anywhere
as
part
of
one
nation
its
people
now
find
and
may
forever
find
their
way
to
europe
by
new
york
to
south
america
and
africa
by
new
orleans
and
to
asia
by
san
francisco
but
separate
our
common
country
into
two
nations
as
designed
by
the
present
rebellion
and
every
man
of
this
great
interior
region
is
thereby
cut
off
from
some
one
or
more
of
these
outlets
not
perhaps
by
a
physical
barrier
but
by
embarrassing
and
onerous
trade
regulations
and
this
is
true
wherever
a
dividing
or
boundary
line
may
be
fixed
place
it
between
the
now
free
and
slave
country
or
place
it
south
of
kentucky
or
north
of
ohio
and
still
the
truth
remains
that
none
south
of
it
can
trade
to
any
port
or
place
north
of
it
and
none
north
of
it
can
trade
to
any
port
or
place
south
of
it
except
upon
terms
dictated
by
a
government
foreign
to
them
these
outlets
east
west
and
south
are
indispensable
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
people
inhabiting
and
to
inhabit
this
vast
interior
region
which
of
the
three
may
be
the
best
is
no
proper
question
all
are
better
than
either
and
all
of
right
belong
to
that
people
and
to
their
successors
forever
true
to
themselves
they
will
not
ask
where
a
line
of
separation
shall
be
but
will
vow
rather
that
there
shall
be
no
such
line
nor
are
the
marginal
regions
less
interested
in
these
communications
to
and
through
them
to
the
great
outside
world
they
too
and
each
of
them
must
have
access
to
this
egypt
of
the
west
without
paying
toll
at
the
crossing
of
any
national
boundary
our
national
strife
springs
not
from
our
permanent
part
not
from
the
land
we
inhabit
not
from
our
national
homestead
there
is
no
possible
severing
of
this
but
would
multiply
and
not
mitigate
evils
among
us
in
all
its
adaptations
and
aptitudes
it
demands
union
and
abhors
separation
in
fact
it
would
ere
long
force
reunion
however
much
of
blood
and
treasure
the
separation
might
have
cost
our
strife
pertains
to
ourselvesto
the
passing
generations
of
menand
it
can
without
convulsion
be
hushed
forever
with
the
passing
of
one
generation
in
this
view
i
recommend
the
adoption
of
the
following
resolution
and
articles
amendatory
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
resolved
by
the
senate
and
house
of

of
the

of
america
in
congress
assembled
twothirds
of
both
houses
concurring
that

free
colored
persons
with

own
consent
at
any
place
or
places
without
the
united
states
i
beg
indulgence
to
discuss
these
proposed
articles
at
some
length
without
slavery
the
rebellion
could
never
have
existed
without
slavery
it
could
not
continue
among
the
friends
of
the
union
there
is
great
diversity
of
sentiment
and
of
policy
in
regard
to
slavery
and
the
african
race
amongst
us
some
would
perpetuate
slavery
some
would
abolish
it
suddenly
and
without
compensation
some
would
abolish
it
gradually
and
with
compensation
some
would
remove
the
freed
people
from
us
and
some
would
retain
them
with
us
and
there
are
yet
other
minor
diversities
because
of
these
diversities
we
waste
much
strength
in
struggles
among
ourselves
by
mutual
concession
we
should
harmonize
and
act
together
this
would
be
compromise
but
it
would
be
compromise
among
the
friends
and
not
with
the
enemies
of
the
union
these
articles
are
intended
to
embody
a
plan
of
such
mutual
concessions
if
the
plan
shall
be
adopted
it
is
assumed
that
emancipation
will
follow
at
least
in
several
of
the
states
as
to
the
first
article
the
main
points
are
first
the
emancipation
secondly
the
length
of
time
for
consummating
it
thirtyseven
years
and
thirdly
the
compensation
the
emancipation
will
be
unsatisfactory
to
the
advocates
of
perpetual
slavery
but
the
length
of
time
should
greatly
mitigate
their
dissatisfaction
the
time
spares
both
races
from
the
evils
of
sudden
derangementin
fact
from
the
necessity
of
any
derangementwhile
most
of
those
whose
habitual
course
of
thought
will
be
disturbed
by
the
measure
will
have
passed
away
before
its
consummation
they
will
never
see
it
another
class
will
hail
the
prospect
of
emancipation
but
will
deprecate
the
length
of
time
they
will
feel
that
it
gives
too
little
to
the
now
living
slaves
but
it
really
gives
them
much
it
saves
them
from
the
vagrant
destitution
which
must
largely
attend
immediate
emancipation
in
localities
where
their
numbers
are
very
great
and
it
gives
the
inspiring
assurance
that
their
posterity
shall
be
free
forever
the
plan
leaves
to
each
state
choosing
to
act
under
it
to
abolish
slavery
now
or
at
the
end
of
the
century
or
at
any
intermediate
time
or
by
degrees
extending
over
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
period
and
it
obliges
no
two
states
to
proceed
alike
it
also
provides
for
compensation
and
generally
the
mode
of
making
it
this
it
would
seem
must
further
mitigate
the
dissatisfaction
of
those
who
favor
perpetual
slavery
and
especially
of
those
who
are
to
receive
the
compensation
doubtless
some
of
those
who
are
to
pay
and
not
to
receive
will
object
yet
the
measure
is
both
just
and
economical
in
a
certain
sense
the
liberation
of
slaves
is
the
destruction
of
propertyproperty
acquired
by
descent
or
by
purchase
the
same
as
any
other
property
it
is
no
less
true
for
having
been
often
said
that
the
people
of
the
south
are
not
more
responsible
for
the
original
introduction
of
this
property
than
are
the
people
of
the
north
and
when
it
is
remembered
how
unhesitatingly
we
all
use
cotton
and
sugar
and
share
the
profits
of
dealing
in
them
it
may
not
be
quite
safe
to
say
that
the
south
has
been
more
responsible
than
the
north
for
its
continuance
if
then
for
a
common
object
this
property
is
to
be
sacrificed
is
it
not
just
that
it
be
done
at
a
common
charge
and
if
with
less
money
or
money
more
easily
paid
we
can
preserve
the
benefits
of
the
union
by
this
means
than
we
can
by
the
war
alone
is
it
not
also
economical
to
do
it
let
us
consider
it
then
let
us
ascertain
the
sum
we
have
expended
in
the
war
since
compensated
emancipation
was
proposed
last
march
and
consider
whether
if
that
measure
had
been
promptly
accepted
by
even
some
of
the
slave
states
the
same
sum
would
not
have
done
more
to
close
the
war
than
has
been
otherwise
done
if
so
the
measure
would
save
money
and
in
that
view
would
be
a
prudent
and
economical
measure
certainly
it
is
not
so
easy
to
pay
something
as
it
is
to
pay
nothing
but
it
is
easier
to
pay
a
large
sum
than
it
is
to
pay
a
larger
one
and
it
is
easier
to
pay
any
sum
when
we
are
able
than
it
is
to
pay
it
before
we
are
able
the
war
requires
large
sums
and
requires
them
at
once
the
aggregate
sum
necessary
for
compensated
emancipation
of
course
would
be
large
but
it
would
require
no
ready
cash
nor
the
bonds
even
any
faster
than
the
emancipation
progresses
this
might
not
and
probably
would
not
close
before
the
end
of
the
thirtyseven
years
at
that
time
we
shall
probably
have
a
hundred
millions
of
people
to
share
the
burden
instead
of
thirtyone
millions
as
now
and
not
only
so
but
the
increase
of
our
population
may
be
expected
to
continue
for
a
long
time
after
that
period
as
rapidly
as
before
because
our
territory
will
not
have
become
full
i
do
not
state
this
inconsiderately
at
the
same
ratio
of
increase
which
we
have
maintained
on
an
average
from
our
first
national
census
in
until
that
of
we
should
in
have
a
population
of
and
why
may
we
not
continue
that
ratio
far
beyond
that
period
our
abundant
room
our
broad
national
homestead
is
our
ample
resource
were
our
territory
as
limited
as
are
the
british
isles
very
certainly
our
population
could
not
expand
as
stated
instead
of
receiving
the
foreign
born
as
now
we
should
be
compelled
to
send
part
of
the
native
born
away
but
such
is
not
our
condition
we
have
square
miles
europe
has
with
a
population
averaging
persons
to
the
square
mile
why
may
not
our
country
at
some
time
average
as
many
is
it
less
fertile
has
it
more
waste
surface
by
mountains
rivers
lakes
deserts
or
other
causes
is
it
inferior
to
europe
in
any
natural
advantage
if
then
we
are
at
some
time
to
be
as
populous
as
europe
how
soon
as
to
when
this
may
be
we
can
judge
by
the
past
and
the
present
as
to
when
it
will
be
if
ever
depends
much
on
whether
we
maintain
the
union
several
of
our
states
are
already
above
the
average
of
europe
to
the
square
mile
massachusetts
has
rhode
island
connecticut
new
york
and
new
jersey
each
also
two
other
great
states
pennsylvania
and
ohio
are
not
far
below
the
former
having
and
the
latter
the
states
already
above
the
european
average
except
new
york
have
increased
in
as
rapid
a
ratio
since
passing
that
point
as
ever
before
while
no
one
of
them
is
equal
to
some
other
parts
of
our
country
in
natural
capacity
for
sustaining
a
dense
population
taking
the
nation
in
the
aggregate
and
we
find
its
population
and
ratio
of
increase
for
the
several
decennial
periods
to
be
as
follows
year
population
ratio
of
increase
per
cent
this
shows
an
average
decennial
increase
of
per
cent
in
population
through
the
seventy
years
from
our
first
to
our
last
census
yet
taken
it
is
seen
that
the
ratio
of
increase
at
no
one
of
these
seven
periods
is
either
per
cent
below
or
per
cent
above
the
average
thus
showing
how
inflexible
and
consequently
how
reliable
the
law
of
increase
in
our
case
is
assuming
that
it
will
continue
it
gives
the
following
results
year
population
these
figures
show
that
our
country
may
be
as
populous
as
europe
now
is
at
some
point
between
and
say
about
our
territory
at
persons
to
the
square
mile
being
of
capacity
to
contain
and
we
will
reach
this
too
if
we
do
not
ourselves
relinquish
the
chance
by
the
folly
and
evils
of
disunion
or
by
long
and
exhausting
war
springing
from
the
only
great
element
of
national
discord
among
us
while
it
can
not
be
foreseen
exactly
how
much
one
huge
example
of
secession
breeding
lesser
ones
indefinitely
would
retard
population
civilization
and
prosperity
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
extent
of
it
would
be
very
great
and
injurious
the
proposed
emancipation
would
shorten
the
war
perpetuate
peace
insure
this
increase
of
population
and
proportionately
the
wealth
of
the
country
with
these
we
should
pay
all
the
emancipation
would
cost
together
with
our
other
debt
easier
than
we
should
pay
our
other
debt
without
it
if
we
had
allowed
our
old
national
debt
to
run
at
per
cent
per
annum
simple
interest
from
the
end
of
our
revolutionary
struggle
until
today
without
paying
anything
on
either
principal
or
interest
each
man
of
us
would
owe
less
upon
that
debt
now
than
each
man
owed
upon
it
then
and
this
because
our
increase
of
men
through
the
whole
period
has
been
greater
than
per
centhas
run
faster
than
the
interest
upon
the
debt
thus
time
alone
relieves
a
debtor
nation
so
long
as
its
population
increases
faster
than
unpaid
interest
accumulates
on
its
debt
this
fact
would
be
no
excuse
for
delaying
payment
of
what
is
justly
due
but
it
shows
the
great
importance
of
time
in
this
connectionthe
great
advantage
of
a
policy
by
which
we
shall
not
have
to
pay
until
we
number
what
by
a
different
policy
we
would
have
to
pay
now
when
we
number
but
in
a
word
it
shows
that
a
dollar
will
be
much
harder
to
pay
for
the
war
than
will
be
a
dollar
for
emancipation
on
the
proposed
plan
and
then
the
latter
will
cost
no
blood
no
precious
life
it
will
be
a
saving
of
both
as
to
the
second
article
i
think
it
would
be
impracticable
to
return
to
bondage
the
class
of
persons
therein
contemplated
some
of
them
doubtless
in
the
property
sense
belong
to
loyal
owners
a
nd
hence
provision
is
made
in
this
article
for
compensating
such
the
third
article
relates
to
the
future
of
the
freed
people
it
does
not
oblige
but
merely
authorizes
congress
to
aid
in
colonizing
such
as
may
consent
this
ought
not
to
be
regarded
as
objectionable
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
other
insomuch
as
it
comes
to
nothing
unless
by
the
mutual
consent
of
the
people
to
be
deported
and
the
american
voters
through
their
representatives
in
congress
i
can
not
make
it
better
known
than
it
already
is
that
i
strongly
favor
colonization
and
yet
i
wish
to
say
there
is
an
objection
urged
against
free
colored
persons
remaining
in
the
country
which
is
largely
imaginary
if
not
sometimes
malicious
it
is
insisted
that
their
presence
would
injure
and
displace
white
labor
and
white
laborers
if
there
ever
could
be
a
proper
time
for
mere
catch
arguments
that
time
surely
is
not
now
in
times
like
the
present
men
should
utter
nothing
for
which
they
would
not
willingly
be
responsible
through
time
and
in
eternity
is
it
true
then
that
colored
people
can
displace
any
more
white
labor
by
being
free
than
by
remaining
slaves
if
they
stay
in
their
old
places
they
jostle
no
white
laborers
if
they
leave
their
old
places
they
leave
them
open
to
white
laborers
logically
there
is
neither
more
nor
less
of
it
emancipation
even
without
deportation
would
probably
enhance
the
wages
of
white
labor
and
very
surely
would
not
reduce
them
thus
the
customary
amount
of
labor
would
still
have
to
be
performedthe
freed
people
would
surely
not
do
more
than
their
old
proportion
of
it
and
very
probably
for
a
time
would
do
less
leaving
an
increased
part
to
white
laborers
bringing
their
labor
into
greater
demand
and
consequently
enhancing
the
wages
of
it
with
deportation
even
to
a
limited
extent
enhanced
wages
to
white
labor
is
mathematically
certain
labor
is
like
any
other
commodity
in
the
marketincrease
the
demand
for
it
and
you
increase
the
price
of
it
reduce
the
supply
of
black
labor
by
colonizing
the
black
laborer
out
of
the
country
and
by
precisely
so
much
you
increase
the
demand
for
and
wages
of
white
labor
but
it
is
dreaded
that
the
freed
people
will
swarm
forth
and
cover
the
whole
land
are
they
not
already
in
the
land
will
liberation
make
them
any
more
numerous
equally
distributed
among
the
whites
of
the
whole
country
and
there
would
be
but
one
colored
to
seven
whites
could
the
one
in
any
way
greatly
disturb
the
seven
there
are
many
communities
now
having
more
than
one
free
colored
person
to
seven
whites
and
this
without
any
apparent
consciousness
of
evil
from
it
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
states
of
maryland
and
delaware
are
all
in
this
condition
the
district
has
more
than
one
free
colored
to
six
whites
and
yet
in
its
frequent
petitions
to
congress
i
believe
it
has
never
presented
the
presence
of
free
colored
persons
as
one
of
its
grievances
but
why
should
emancipation
south
send
the
free
people
north
people
of
any
color
seldom
run
unless
there
be
something
to
run
from
heretofore
colored
people
to
some
extent
have
fled
north
from
bondage
and
now
perhaps
from
both
bondage
and
destitution
but
if
gradual
emancipation
and
deportation
be
adopted
they
will
have
neither
to
flee
from
their
old
masters
will
give
them
wages
at
least
until
new
laborers
can
be
procured
and
the
freedmen
in
turn
will
gladly
give
their
labor
for
the
wages
till
new
homes
can
be
found
for
them
in
congenial
climes
and
with
people
of
their
own
blood
and
race
this
proposition
can
be
trusted
on
the
mutual
interests
involved
and
in
any
event
can
not
the
north
decide
for
itself
whether
to
receive
them
again
as
practice
proves
more
than
theory
in
any
case
has
there
been
any
irruption
of
colored
people
northward
because
of
the
abolishment
of
slavery
in
this
district
last
spring
what
i
have
said
of
the
proportion
of
free
colored
persons
to
the
whites
in
the
district
is
from
the
census
of
having
no
reference
to
persons
called
contrabands
nor
to
those
made
free
by
the
act
of
congress
abolishing
slavery
here
the
plan
consisting
of
these
articles
is
recommended
not
but
that
a
restoration
of
the
national
authority
would
be
accepted
without
its
adoption
nor
will
the
war
nor
proceedings
under
the
proclamation
of
september
be
stayed
because
of
the
recommendation
of
this
plan
its
timely
adoption
i
doubt
not
would
bring
restoration
and
thereby
stay
both
and
notwithstanding
this
plan
the
recommendation
that
congress
provide
by
law
for
compensating
any
state
which
may
adopt
emancipation
before
this
plan
shall
have
been
acted
upon
is
hereby
earnestly
renewed
such
would
be
only
an
advance
part
of
the
plan
and
the
same
arguments
apply
to
both
this
plan
is
recommended
as
a
means
not
in
exclusion
of
but
additional
to
all
others
for
restoring
and
preserving
the
national
authority
throughout
the
union
the
subject
is
presented
exclusively
in
its
economical
aspect
the
plan
would
i
am
confident
secure
peace
more
speedily
and
maintain
it
more
permanently
than
can
be
done
by
force
alone
while
all
it
would
cost
considering
amounts
and
manner
of
payment
and
times
of
payment
would
be
easier
paid
than
will
be
the
additional
cost
of
the
war
if
we
rely
solely
upon
force
it
is
much
very
much
that
it
would
cost
no
blood
at
all
the
plan
is
proposed
as
permanent
constitutional
law
it
can
not
become
such
without
the
concurrence
of
first
twothirds
of
congress
and
afterwards
threefourths
of
the
states
the
requisite
threefourths
of
the
states
will
necessarily
include
seven
of
the
slave
states
their
concurrence
if
obtained
will
give
assurance
of
their
severally
adopting
emancipation
at
no
very
distant
day
upon
the
new
constitutional
terms
this
assurance
would
end
the
struggle
now
and
save
the
union
forever
i
do
not
forget
the
gravity
which
should
characterize
a
paper
addressed
to
the
congress
of
the
nation
by
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
nation
nor
do
i
forget
that
some
of
you
are
my
seniors
nor
that
many
of
you
have
more
experience
than
i
in
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
yet
i
trust
that
in
view
of
the
great
responsibility
resting
upon
me
you
will
perceive
no
want
of
respect
to
yourselves
in
any
undue
earnestness
i
may
seem
to
display
is
it
doubted
then
that
the
plan
i
propose
if
adopted
would
shorten
the
war
and
thus
lessen
its
expenditure
of
money
and
of
blood
is
it
doubted
that
it
would
restore
the
national
authority
and
national
prosperity
and
perpetuate
both
indefinitely
is
it
doubted
that
we
herecongress
and
executive
can
secure
its
adoption
will
not
the
good
people
respond
to
a
united
and
earnest
appeal
from
us
can
we
can
they
by
any
other
means
so
certainly
or
so
speedily
assure
these
vital
objects
we
can
succeed
only
by
concert
it
is
not
can
any
of
us
imagine
better
but
can
we
all
do
better
object
whatsoever
is
possible
still
the
question
recurs
can
we
do
better
the
dogmas
of
the
quiet
past
are
inadequate
to
the
stormy
present
the
occasion
is
piled
high
with
difficulty
and
we
must
rise
with
the
occasion
as
our
case
is
new
so
we
must
think
anew
and
act
anew
we
must
disenthrall
ourselves
and
then
we
shall
save
our
country
fellowcitizens
we
can
not
escape
history
we
of
this
congress
and
this
administration
will
be
remembered
in
spite
of
ourselves
no
personal
significance
or
insignificance
can
spare
one
or
another
of
us
the
fiery
trial
through
which
we
pass
will
light
us
down
in
honor
or
dishonor
to
the
latest
generation
we
say
we
are
for
the
union
the
world
will
not
forget
that
we
say
this
we
know
how
to
save
the
union
the
world
knows
we
do
know
how
to
save
it
we
even
we
here
hold
the
power
and
bear
the
responsibility
in
giving
freedom
to
the
slave
we
assure
freedom
to
the
freehonorable
alike
in
what
we
give
and
what
we
preserve
we
shall
nobly
save
or
meanly
lose
the
last
best
hope
of
earth
other
means
may
succeed
this
could
not
fail
the
way
is
plain
peaceful
generous
justa
way
which
if
followed
the
world
will
forever
applaud
and
god
must
forever
bless

fellowcitizens
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
the
midst
of
unprecedented
political
troubles
we
have
cause
of
great
gratitude
to
god
for
unusual
good
health
and
most
abundant
harvests
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
in
the
peculiar
exigencies
of
the
times
our
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
has
been
attended
with
profound
solicitude
chiefly
turning
upon
our
own
domestic
affairs
a
disloyal
portion
of
the
american
people
have
during
the
whole
year
been
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
divide
and
destroy
the
union
a
nation
which
endures
factious
domestic
division
is
exposed
to
disrespect
abroad
and
one
party
if
not
both
is
sure
sooner
or
later
to
invoke
foreign
intervention
nations
thus
tempted
to
interfere
are
not
always
able
to
resist
the
counsels
of
seeming
expediency
and
ungenerous
ambition
although
measures
adopted
under
such
influences
seldom
fail
to
be
unfortunate
and
injurious
to
those
adopting
them
the
disloyal
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
have
offered
the
ruin
of
our
country
in
return
for
the
aid
and
comfort
which
they
have
invoked
abroad
have
received
less
patronage
and
encouragement
than
they
probably
expected
if
it
were
just
to
suppose
as
the
insurgents
have
seemed
to
assume
that
foreign
nations
in
this
case
discarding
all
moral
social
and
treaty
obligations
would
act
solely
and
selfishly
for
the
most
speedy
restoration
of
commerce
including
especially
the
acquisition
of
cotton
those
nations
appear
as
yet
not
to
have
seen
their
way
to
their
object
more
directly
or
clearly
through
the
destruction
than
through
the
preservation
of
the
union
if
we
could
dare
to
believe
that
foreign
nations
are
actuated
by
no
higher
principle
than
this
i
am
quite
sure
a
sound
argument
could
be
made
to
show
them
that
they
can
reach
their
aim
more
readily
and
easily
by
aiding
to
crush
this
rebellion
than
by
giving
encouragement
to
it
the
principal
lever
relied
on
by
the
insurgents
for
exciting
foreign
nations
to
hostility
against
us
as
already
intimated
is
the
embarrassment
of
commerce
those
nations
however
not
improbably
saw
from
the
first
that
it
was
the
union
which
made
as
well
our
foreign
as
our
domestic
commerce
they
can
scarcely
have
failed
to
perceive
that
the
effort
for
disunion
produces
the
existing
difficulty
and
that
one
strong
nation
promises
more
durable
peace
and
a
more
extensive
valuable
and
reliable
commerce
than
can
the
same
nation
broken
into
hostile
fragments
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
review
our
discussions
with
foreign
states
because
whatever
might
be
their
wishes
or
dispositions
the
integrity
of
our
country
and
the
stability
of
our
government
mainly
depend
not
upon
them
but
on
the
loyalty
virtue
patriotism
and
intelligence
of
the
american
people
the
correspondence
itself
with
the
usual
reservations
is
herewith
submitted
i
venture
to
hope
it
will
appear
that
we
have
practiced
prudence
and
liberality
toward
foreign
powers
averting
causes
of
irritation
and
with
firmness
maintaining
our
own
rights
and
honor
since
however
it
is
apparent
that
here
as
in
every
other
state
foreign
dangers
necessarily
attend
domestic
difficulties
i
recommend
that
adequate
and
ample
measures
be
adopted
for
maintaining
the
public
defenses
on
every
side
while
under
this
general
recommendation
provision
for
defending
our
seacoast
line
readily
occurs
to
the
mind
i
also
in
the
same
connection
ask
the
attention
of
congress
to
our
great
lakes
and
rivers
it
is
believed
that
some
fortifications
and
depots
of
arms
and
munitions
with
harbor
and
navigation
improvements
all
at
wellselected
points
upon
these
would
be
of
great
importance
to
the
national
defense
and
preservation
i
ask
attention
to
the
views
of
the
secretary
of
war
expressed
in
his
report
upon
the
same
general
subject
i
deem
it
of
importance
that
the
loyal
regions
of
east
tennessee
and
western
north
carolina
should
be
connected
with
kentucky
and
other
faithful
parts
of
the
union
by
railroad
i
therefore
recommend
as
a
military
measure
that
congress
provide
for
the
construction
of
such
road
as
speedily
as
possible
kentucky
no
doubt
will
cooperate
and
through
her
legislature
make
the
most
judicious
selection
of
a
line
the
northern
terminus
must
connect
with
some
existing
railroad
and
whether
the
route
shall
be
from
lexington
or
nicholasville
to
the
cumberland
gap
or
from
lebanon
to
the
tennessee
line
in
the
direction
of
knoxville
or
on
some
still
different
line
can
easily
be
determined
kentucky
and
the
general
government
cooperating
the
work
can
be
completed
in
a
very
short
time
and
when
done
it
will
be
not
only
of
vast
present
usefulness
but
also
a
valuable
permanent
improvement
worth
its
cost
in
all
the
future
some
treaties
designed
chiefly
for
the
interests
of
commerce
and
having
no
grave
political
importance
have
been
negotiated
and
will
be
submitted
to
the
senate
for
their
consideration
although
we
have
failed
to
induce
some
of
the
commercial
powers
to
adopt
a
desirable
melioration
of
the
rigor
of
maritime
war
we
have
removed
all
obstructions
from
the
way
of
this
humane
reform
except
such
as
are
merely
of
temporary
and
accidental
occurrence
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
correspondence
between
her
britannic
majestys
minister
accredited
to
this
government
and
the
secretary
of
state
relative
to
the
detention
of
the
british
ship
perthshire
in
june
last
by
the
united
states
steamer
massachusetts
for
a
supposed
breach
of
the
blockade
as
this
detention
was
occasioned
by
an
obvious
misapprehension
of
the
facts
and
as
justice
requires
that
we
should
commit
no
belligerent
act
not
rounded
in
strict
right
as
sanctioned
by
public
law
i
recommend
that
an
appropriation
be
made
to
satisfy
the
reasonable
demand
of
the
owners
of
the
vessel
for
her
detention
i
repeat
the
recommendation
of
my
predecessor
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
in
december
last
in
regard
to
the
disposition
of
the
surplus
which
will
probably
remain
after
satisfying
the
claims
of
american
citizens
against
china
pursuant
to
the
awards
of
the
commissioners
under
the
act
of
the
d
of
march
if
however
it
should
not
be
deemed
advisable
to
carry
that
recommendation
into
effect
i
would
suggest
that
authority
be
given
for
investing
the
principal
over
the
proceeds
of
the
surplus
referred
to
in
good
securities
with
a
view
to
the
satisfaction
of
such
other
just
claims
of
our
citizens
against
china
as
are
not
unlikely
to
arise
hereafter
in
the
course
of
our
extensive
trade
with
that
empire
by
the
act
of
the
th
of
august
last
congress
authorized
the
president
to
instruct
the
commanders
of
suitable
vessels
to
defend
themselves
against
and
to
capture
pirates
this
authority
has
been
exercised
in
a
single
instance
only
for
the
more
effectual
protection
of
our
extensive
and
valuable
commerce
in
the
eastern
seas
especially
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
also
be
advisable
to
authorize
the
commanders
of
sailing
vessels
to
recapture
any
prizes
which
pirates
may
make
of
united
states
vessels
and
their
cargoes
and
the
consular
courts
now
established
by
law
in
eastern
countries
to
adjudicate
the
cases
in
the
event
that
this
should
not
be
objected
to
by
the
local
authorities
if
any
good
reason
exists
why
we
should
persevere
longer
in
withholding
our
recognition
of
the
independence
and
sovereignty
of
hayti
and
liberia
i
am
unable
to
discern
it
unwilling
however
to
inaugurate
a
novel
policy
in
regard
to
them
without
the
approbation
of
congress
i
submit
for
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
an
appropriation
for
maintaining
a
charge
daffaires
near
each
of
those
new
states
it
does
not
admit
of
doubt
that
important
commercial
advantages
might
be
secured
by
favorable
treaties
with
them
the
operations
of
the
treasury
during
the
period
which
has
elapsed
since
your
adjournment
have
been
conducted
with
signal
success
the
patriotism
of
the
people
has
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
the
large
means
demanded
by
the
public
exigencies
much
of
the
national
loan
has
been
taken
by
citizens
of
the
industrial
classes
whose
confidence
in
their
countrys
faith
and
zeal
for
their
countrys
deliverance
from
present
peril
have
induced
them
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
the
government
the
whole
of
their
limited
acquisitions
this
fact
imposes
peculiar
obligations
to
economy
in
disbursement
and
energy
in
action
the
revenue
from
all
sources
including
loans
for
the
financial
year
ending
on
the
th
of
june
was
and
the
expenditures
for
the
same
period
including
payments
on
account
of
the
public
debt
were
leaving
a
balance
in
the
treasury
on
the
st
of
july
of
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
financial
year
ending
on
the
th
of
september
the
receipts
from
all
sources
including
the
balance
of
the
st
of
july
were
and
the
expenses
leaving
a
balance
on
the
st
of
october
of
estimates
for
the
remaining
three
quarters
of
the
year
and
for
the
financial
year
together
with
his
views
of
ways
and
means
for
meeting
the
demands
contemplated
by
them
will
be
submitted
to
congress
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
the
expenditures
made
necessary
by
the
rebellion
are
not
beyond
the
resources
of
the
loyal
people
and
to
believe
that
the
same
patriotism
which
has
thus
far
sustained
the
government
will
continue
to
sustain
it
till
peace
and
union
shall
again
bless
the
land
i
respectfully
refer
to
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
war
for
information
respecting
the
numerical
strength
of
the
army
and
for
recommendations
having
in
view
an
increase
of
its
efficiency
and
the
wellbeing
of
the
various
branches
of
the
service
intrusted
to
his
care
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
the
patriotism
of
the
people
has
proved
equal
to
the
occasion
and
that
the
number
of
troops
tendered
greatly
exceeds
the
force
which
congress
authorized
me
to
call
into
the
field
i
refer
with
pleasure
to
those
portions
of
his
report
which
make
allusion
to
the
creditable
degree
of
discipline
already
attained
by
our
troops
and
to
the
excellent
sanitary
condition
of
the
entire
army
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
for
an
organization
of
the
militia
upon
a
uniform
basis
is
a
subject
of
vital

importance
to
the
future
safety
of
the
country
and
is
commended
to
the
serious
attention
of
congress
the
large
addition
to
the
regular
army
in
connection
with
the
defection
that
has
so
considerably
diminished
the
number
of
its
officers
gives
peculiar
importance
to
his
recommendation
for
increasing
the
corps
of
cadets
to
the
greatest
capacity
of
the
military
academy
by
mere
omission
i
presume
congress
has
failed
to
provide
chaplains
for
hospitals
occupied
by
volunteers
this
subject
was
brought
to
my
notice
and
i
was
induced
to
draw
up
the
form
of
a
letter
one
copy
of
which
properly
addressed
has
been
delivered
to
each
of
the
persons
and
at
the
dates
respectively
named
and
stated
in
a
schedule
containing
also
the
form
of
the
letter
marked
a
and
herewith
transmitted
these
gentlemen
i
understand
entered
upon
the
duties
designated
at
the
times
respectively
stated
in
the
schedule
and
have
labored
faithfully
therein
ever
since
i
therefore
recommend
that
they
be
compensated
at
the
same
rate
as
chaplains
in
the
army
i
further
suggest
that
general
provision
be
made
for
chaplains
to
serve
at
hospitals
as
well
as
with
regiments
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
presents
in
detail
the
operations
of
that
branch
of
the
service
the
activity
and
energy
which
have
characterized
its
administration
and
the
results
of
measures
to
increase
its
efficiency
and
power
such
have
been
the
additions
by
construction
and
purchase
that
it
may
almost
be
said
a
navy
has
been
created
and
brought
into
service
since
our
difficulties
commenced
besides
blockading
our
extensive
coast
squadrons
larger
than
ever
before
assembled
under
our
flag
have
been
put
afloat
and
performed
deeds
which
have
increased
our
naval
renown
i
would
invite
special
attention
to
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
for
a
more
perfect
organization
of
the
navy
by
introducing
additional
grades
in
the
service
the
present
organization
is
defective
and
unsatisfactory
and
the
suggestions
submitted
by
the
department
will
it
is
believed
if
adopted
obviate
the
difficulties
alluded
to
promote
harmony
and
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
navy
there
are
three
vacancies
on
the
bench
of
the
supreme
courttwo
by
the
decease
of
justices
daniel
and
mclean
and
one
by
the
resignation
of
justice
campbell
i
have
so
far
forborne
making
nominations
to
fill
these
vacancies
for
reasons
which
i
will
now
state
two
of
the
outgoing
judges
resided
within
the
states
now
overrun
by
revolt
so
that
if
successors
were
appointed
in
the
same
localities
they
could
not
now
serve
upon
their
circuits
and
many
of
the
most
competent
men
there
probably
would
not
take
the
personal
hazard
of
accepting
to
serve
even
here
upon
the
supreme
bench
i
have
been
unwilling
to
throw
all
the
appointments
northward
thus
disabling
myself
from
doing
justice
to
the
south
on
the
return
of
peace
although
i
may
remark
that
to
transfer
to
the
north
one
which
has
heretofore
been
in
the
south
would
not
with
reference
to
territory
and
population
be
unjust
during
the
long
and
brilliant
judicial
career
of
judge
mclean
his
circuit
grew
into
an
empire
altogether
too
large
for
any
one
judge
to
give
the
courts
therein
more
than
a
nominal
attendancerising
in
population
from
in
to
in
besides
this
the
country
generally
has
outgrown
our
present
judicial
system
if
uniformity
was
at
all
intended
the
system
requires
that
all
the
states
shall
be
accommodated
with
circuit
courts
attended
by
supreme
judges
while
in
fact
wisconsin
minnesota
iowa
kansas
florida
texas
california
and
oregon
have
never
had
any
such
courts
nor
can
this
well
be
remedied
without
a
change
in
the
system
because
the
adding
of
judges
to
the
supreme
court
enough
for
the
accommodation
of
all
parts
of
the
country
with
circuit
courts
would
create
a
court
altogether
too
numerous
for
a
judicial
body
of
any
sort
and
the
evil
if
it
be
one
will
increase
as
new
states
come
into
the
union
circuit
courts
are
useful
or
they
are
not
useful
if
useful
no
state
should
be
denied
them
if
not
useful
no
state
should
have
them
let
them
be
provided
for
all
or
abolished
as
to
all
three
modifications
occur
to
me
either
of
which
i
think
would
be
an
improvement
upon
our
present
system
let
the
supreme
court
be
of
convenient
number
in
every
event
then
first
let
the
whole
country
be
divided
into
circuits
of
convenient
size
the
supreme
judges
to
serve
in
a
number
of
them
corresponding
to
their
own
number
and
independent
circuit
judges
be
provided
for
all
the
rest
or
secondly
let
the
supreme
judges
be
relieved
from
circuit
duties
and
circuit
judges
provided
for
all
the
circuits
or
thirdly
dispense
with
circuit
courts
altogether
leaving
the
judicial
functions
wholly
to
the
district
courts
and
an
independent
supreme
court
i
respectfully
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
congress
the
present
condition
of
the
statute
laws
with
the
hope
that
congress
will
be
able
to
find
an
easy
remedy
for
many
of
the
inconveniences
and
evils
which
constantly
embarrass
those
engaged
in
the
practical
administration
of
them
since
the
organization
of
the
government
congress
has
enacted
some
acts
and
joint
resolutions
which
fill
more
than
closely
printed
pages
and
are
scattered
through
many
volumes
many
of
these
acts
have
been
drawn
in
haste
and
without
sufficient
caution
so
that
their
provisions
are
often
obscure
in
themselves
or
in
conflict
with
each
other
or
at
least
so
doubtful
as
to
render
it
very
difficult
for
even
the
bestinformed
persons
to
ascertain
precisely
what
the
statute
law
really
is
it
seems
to
me
very
important
that
the
statute
laws
should
be
made
as
plain
and
intelligible
as
possible
and
be
reduced
to
as
small
a
compass
as
may
consist
with
the
fullness
and
precision
of
the
will
of
the
legislature
and
the
perspicuity
of
its
language
this
well
done
would
i
think
greatly
facilitate
the
labors
of
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
assist
in
the
administration
of
the
laws
and
would
be
a
lasting
benefit
to
the
people
by
placing
before
them
in
a
more
accessible
and
intelligible
form
the
laws
which
so
deeply
concern
their
interests
and
their
duties
i
am
informed
by
some
whose
opinions
i
respect
that
all
the
acts
of
congress
now
in
force
and
of
a
permanent
and
general
nature
might
be
revised
and
rewritten
so
as
to
be
embraced
in
one
volume
or
at
most
two
volumes
of
ordinary
and
convenient
size
and
i
respectfully
recommend
to
congress
to
consider
of
the
subject
and
if
my
suggestion
be
approved
to
devise
such
plan
as
to
their
wisdom
shall
seem
most
proper
for
the
attainment
of
the
end
proposed
one
of
the
unavoidable
consequences
of
the
present
insurrection
is
the
entire
suppression
in
many
places
of
all
the
ordinary
means
of
administering
civil
justice
by
the
officers
and
in
the
forms
of
existing
law
this
is
the
case
in
whole
or
in
part
in
all
the
insurgent
states
and
as
our
armies
advance
upon
and
take
possession
of
parts
of
those
states
the
practical
evil
becomes
more
apparent
there
are
no
courts
nor
officers
to
whom
the
citizens
of
other
states
may
apply
for
the
enforcement
of
their
lawful
claims
against
citizens
of
the
insurgent
states
and
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
debt
constituting
such
claims
some
have
estimated
it
as
high
as
due
in
large
part
from
insurgents
in
open
rebellion
to
loyal
citizens
who
are
even
now
making
great
sacrifices
in
the
discharge
of
their
patriotic
duty
to
support
the
government
under
these
circumstances
i
have
been
urgently
solicited
to
establish
by
military
power
courts
to
administer
summary
justice
in
such
cases
i
have
thus
far
declined
to
do
it
not
because
i
had
any
doubt
that
the
end
proposedthe
collection
of
the
debtswas
just
and
right
in
itself
but
because
i
have
been
unwilling
to
go
beyond
the
pressure
of
necessity
in
the
unusual
exercise
of
power
but
the
powers
of
congress
i
suppose
are
equal
to
the
anomalous
occasion
and
therefore
i
refer
the
whole
matter
to
congress
with
the
hope
that
a
plan
may
be
devised
for
the
administration
of
justice
in
all
such
parts
of
the
insurgent
states
and
territories
as
may
be
under
the
control
of
this
government
whether
by
a
voluntary
return
to
allegiance
and
order
or
by
the
power
of
our
arms
this
however
not
to
be
a
permanent
institution
but
a
temporary
substitute
and
to
cease
as
soon
as
the
ordinary
courts
can
be
reestablished
in
peace
it
is
important
that
some
more
convenient
means
should
be
provided
if
possible
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
against
the
government
especially
in
view
of
their
increased
number
by
reason
of
the
war
it
is
as
much
the
duty
of
government
to
render
prompt
justice
against
itself
in
favor
of
citizens
as
it
is
to
administer
the
same
between
private
individuals
the
investigation
and
adjudication
of
claims
in
their
nature
belong
to
the
judicial
department
besides
it
is
apparent
that
the
attention
of
congress
will
be
more
than
usually
engaged
for
some
time
to
come
with
great
national
questions
it
was
intended
by
the
organization
of
the
court
of
claims
mainly
to
remove
this
branch
of
business
from
the
halls
of
congress
but
while
the
court
has
proved
to
be
an
effective
and
valuable
means
of
investigation
it
in
great
degree
fails
to
effect
the
object
of
its
creation
for
want
of
power
to
make
its
judgments
final
fully
aware
of
the
delicacy
not
to
say
the
danger
of
the
subject
i
commend
to
your
careful
consideration
whether
this
power
of
making
judgments
final
may
not
properly
be
given
to
the
court
reserving
the
right
of
appeal
on
questions
of
law
to
the
supreme
court
with
such
other
provisions
as
experience
may
have
shown
to
be
necessary
i
ask
attention
to
the
report
of
the
postmastergeneral
the
following
being
a
summary
statement
of
the
condition
of
the
department
the
revenue
from
all
sources
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
including
the
annual
permanent
appropriation
of
for
the
transportation
of
free
mail
matter
was
being
about
per
cent
less
than
the
revenue
for
the
expenditures
were
showing
a
decrease
of
more
than
per
cent
as
compared
with
those
of
the
previous
year
and
leaving
an
excess
of
expenditure
over
the
revenue
for
the
last
fiscal
year
of

the
gross
revenue
for
the
year
ending
june
is
estimated
at
an
increase
of
per
cent
on
that
of
making
to
which
should
be
added
the
earnings
of
the
department
in
carrying
free
matter
viz
making
the
total
expenditures
for
are
estimated
at
leaving
an
estimated
deficiency
of
to
be
supplied
from
the
treasury
in
addition
to
the
permanent
appropriation
the
present
insurrection
shows
i
think
that
the
extension
of
this
district
across
the
potomac
river
at
the
time
of
establishing
the
capital
here
was
eminently
wise
and
consequently
that
the
relinquishment
of
that
portion
of
it
which
lies
within
the
state
of
virginia
was
unwise
and
dangerous
i
submit
for
your
consideration
the
expediency
of
regaining
that
part
of
the
district
and
the
restoration
of
the
original
boundaries
thereof
through
negotiations
with
the
state
of
virginia
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
with
the
accompanying
documents
exhibits
the
condition
of
the
several
branches
of
the
public
business
pertaining
to
that
department
the
depressing
influences
of
the
insurrection
have
been
specially
felt
in
the
operations
of
the
patent
and
general
land
offices
the
cash
receipts
from
the
sales
of
public
lands
during
the
past
year
have
exceeded
the
expenses
of
our
land
system
only
about
the
sales
have
been
entirely
suspended
in
the
southern
states
while
the
interruptions
to
the
business
of
the
country
and
the
diversion
of
large
numbers
of
men
from
labor
to
military
service
have
obstructed
settlements
in
the
new
states
and
territories
of
the
northwest
the
receipts
of
the
patent
office
have
declined
in
nine
months
about
rendering
a
large
reduction
of
the
force
employed
necessary
to
make
it
selfsustaining
the
demands
upon
the
pension
office
will
be
largely
increased
by
the
insurrection
numerous
applications
for
pensions
based
upon
the
casualties
of
the
existing
war
have
already
been
made
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
many
who
are
now
upon
the
pension
rolls
and
in
receipt
of
the
bounty
of
the
government
are
in
the
ranks
of
the
insurgent
army
or
giving
them
aid
and
comfort
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
directed
a
suspension
of
the
payment
of
the
pensions
of
such
persons
upon
proof
of
their
disloyalty
i
recommend
that
congress
authorize
that
officer
to
cause
the
names
of
such
persons
to
be
stricken
from
the
pension
rolls
the
relations
of
the
government
with
the
indian
tribes
have
been
greatly
disturbed
by
the
insurrection
especially
in
the
southern
superintendency
and
in
that
of
new
mexico
the
indian
country
south
of
kansas
is
in
the
possession
of
insurgents
from
texas
and
arkansas
the
agents
of
the
united
states
appointed
since
the
th
of
march
for
this
superintendency
have
been
unable
to
reach
their
posts
while
the
most
of
those
who
were
in
office
before
that
time
have
espoused
the
insurrectionary
cause
and
assume
to
exercise
the
powers
of
agents
by
virtue
of
commissions
from
the
insurrectionists
it
has
been
stated
in
the
public
press
that
a
portion
of
those
indians
have
been
organized
as
a
military
force
and
are
attached
to
the
army
of
the
insurgents
although
the
government
has
no
official
information
upon
this
subject
letters
have
been
written
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
by
several
prominent
chiefs
giving
assurance
of
their
loyalty
to
the
united
states
and
expressing
a
wish
for
the
presence
of
federal
troops
to
protect
them
it
is
believed
that
upon
the
repossession
of
the
country
by
the
federal
forces
the
indians
will
readily
cease
all
hostile
demonstrations
and
resume
their
former
relations
to
the
government
agriculture
confessedly
the
largest
interest
of
the
nation
has
not
a
department
nor
a
bureau
but
a
clerkship
only
assigned
to
it
in
the
government
while
it
is
fortunate
that
this
great
interest
is
so
independent
in
its
nature
as
to
not
have
demanded
and
extorted
more
from
the
government
i
respectfully
ask
congress
to
consider
whether
something
more
can
not
be
given
voluntarily
with
general
advantage
annual
reports
exhibiting
the
condition
of
our
agriculture
commerce
and
manufactures
would
present
a
fund
of
information
of
great
practical
value
to
the
country
while
i
make
no
suggestion
as
to
details
i
venture
the
opinion
that
an
agricultural
and
statistical
bureau
might
profitably
be
organized
the
execution
of
the
laws
for
the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
has
been
confided
to
the
department
of
the
interior
it
is
a
subject
of
gratulation
that
the
efforts
which
have
been
made
for
the
suppression
of
this
inhuman
traffic
have
been
recently
attended
with
unusual
success
five
vessels
being
fitted
out
for
the
slave
trade
have
been
seized
and
condemned
two
mates
of
vessels
engaged
in
the
trade
and
one
person
in
equipping
a
vessel
as
a
slaver
have
been
convicted
and
subjected
to
the
penalty
of
fine
and
imprisonment
and
one
captain
taken
with
a
cargo
of
africans
on
board
his
vessel
has
been
convicted
of
the
highest
grade
of
offense
under
our
laws
the
punishment
of
which
is
death
the
territories
of
colorado
dakota
and
nevada
created
by
the
last
congress
have
been
organized
and
civil
administration
has
been
inaugurated
therein
under
auspices
especially
gratifying
when
it
is
considered
that
the
leaven
of
treason
was
found
existing
in
some
of
these
new
countries
when
the
federal
officers
arrived
there
the
abundant
natural
resources
of
these
territories
with
the
security
and
protection
afforded
by
organized
government
will
doubtless
invite
to
them
a
large
immigration
when
peace
shall
restore
the
business
of
the
country
to
its
accustomed
channels
i
submit
the
resolutions
of
the
legislature
of
colorado
which
evidence
the
patriotic
spirit
of
the
people
of
the
territory
so
far
the
authority
of
the
united
states
has
been
upheld
in
all
the
territories
as
it
is
hoped
it
will
be
in
the
future
i
commend
their
interests
and
defense
to
the
enlightened
and
generous
care
of
congress
i
recommend
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
congress
the
interests
of
the
district
of
columbia
the
insurrection
has
been
the
cause
of
much
suffering
and
sacrifice
to
its
inhabitants
and
as
they
have
no
representative
in
congress
that
body
should
not
overlook
their
just
claims
upon
the
government
at
your
late
session
a
joint
resolution
was
adopted
authorizing
the
president
to
take
measures
for
facilitating
a
proper
representation
of
the
industrial
interests
of
the
united
states
at
the
exhibition
of
the
industry
of
all
nations
to
be
holden
at
london
in
the
year
i
regret
to
say
i
have
been
unable
to
give
personal
attention
to
this
subjecta
subject
at
once
so
interesting
in
itself
and
so
extensively
and
intimately
connected
with
the
material
prosperity
of
the
world
through
the
secretaries
of
state
and
of
the
interior
a
plan
or
system
has
been
devised
and
partly
matured
and
which
will
be
laid
before
you
under
and
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
congress
entitled
an
act
to
confiscate
property
used
for
insurrectionary
purposes
approved
august
the
legal
claims
of
certain
persons
to
the
labor
and
service
of
certain
other
persons
have
become
forfeited
and
numbers
of
the
latter
thus
liberated
are
already
dependent
on
the
united
states
and
must
be
provided
for
in
some
way
besides
this
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
of
the
states
will
pass
similar
enactments
for
their
own
benefit
respectively
and
by
operation
of
which
persons
of
the
same
class
will
be
thrown
upon
them
for
disposal
in
such
case
i
recommend
that
congress
provide
for
accepting
such
persons
from
such
states
according
to
some
mode
of
valuation
in
lieu
pro
tanto
of
direct
taxes
or
upon
some
other
plan
to
be
agreed
on
with
such
states
respectively
that
such
persons
on
such
acceptance
by
the
general
government
be
at
once
deemed
free
and
that
in
any
event
steps
be
taken
for
colonizing
both
classes
or
the
one
first
mentioned
if
the
other
shall
not
be
brought
into
existence
at
some
place
or
places
in
a
climate
congenial
to
them
it
might
be
well
to
consider
too
whether
the
free
colored
people
already
in
the
united
states
could
not
so
far
as
individuals
may
desire
be
included
in
such
colonization
to
carry
out
the
plan
of
colonization
may
involve
the
acquiring
of
territory
and
also
the
appropriation
of
money
beyond
that
to
be
expended
in
the
territorial
acquisition
having
practiced
the
acquisition
of
territory
for
nearly
sixty
years
the
question
of
constitutional
power
to
do
so
is
no
longer
an
open
one
with
us
the
power
was
questioned
at
first
by
mr
jefferson
who
however
in
the
purchase
of
louisiana
yielded
his
scruples
on
the
plea
of
great
expediency
if
it
be
said
that
the
only
legitimate
object
of
acquiring
territory
is
to
furnish
homes
for
white
men
this
measure
effects
that
object
for
the
emigration
of
colored
men
leaves
additional
room
for
white
men
remaining
or
coming
here
mr
jefferson
however
placed
the
importance
of
procuring
louisiana
more
on
political
and
commercial
grounds
than
on
providing
room
for
population
on
this
whole
proposition
including
the
appropriation
of
money
with
the
acquisition
of
territory
does
not
the
expediency
amount
to
absolute
necessitythat
without
which
the
government
itself
can
not
be
perpetuated
the
war
continues
in
considering
the
policy
to
be
adopted
for
suppressing
the
insurrection
i
have
been
anxious
and
careful
that
the
inevitable
conflict
for
this
purpose
shall
not
degenerate
into
a
violent
and
remorseless
revolutionary
struggle
i
have
therefore
in
every
case
thought
it
proper
to
keep
the
integrity
of
the
union
prominent
as
the
primary
object
of
the
contest
on
our
pan
leaving
all
questions
which
are
not
of
vital
military
importance
to
the
more
deliberate
action
of
the
legislature
in
the
exercise
of
my
best
discretion
i
have
adhered
to
the
blockade
of
the
ports
held
by
the
insurgents
instead
of
putting
in
force
by
proclamation
the
law
of
congress
enacted
at
the
late
session
for
closing
those
ports
so
also
obeying
the
dictates
of
prudence
as
well
as
the
obligations
of
law
instead
of
transcending
i
have
adhered
to
the
act
of
congress
to
confiscate
property
used
for
insurrectionary
purposes
if
a
new
law
upon

the
same
subject
shall
be
proposed
its
propriety
will
be
duly
considered
the
union
must
be
preserved
and
hence
all
indispensable
means
must
be
employed
we
should
not
be
in
haste
to
determine
that
radical
and
extreme
measures
which
may
reach
the
loyal
as
well
as
the
disloyal
are
indispensable
the
inaugural
address
at
the
beginning
of
the
administration
and
the
message
to
congress
at
the
late
special
session
were
both
mainly
devoted
to
the
domestic
controversy
out
of
which
the
insurrection
and
consequent
war
have
sprung
nothing
now
occurs
to
add
or
subtract
to
or
from
the
principles
or
general
purposes
stated
and
expressed
in
those
documents
the
last
ray
of
hope
for
preserving
the
union
peaceably
expired
at
the
assault
upon
fort
sumter
and
a
general
review
of
what
has
occurred
since
may
not
be
unprofitable
what
was
painfully
uncertain
then
is
much
better
defined
and
more
distinct
now
and
the
progress
of
events
is
plainly
in
the
right
direction
the
insurgents
confidently
claimed
a
strong
support
from
north
of
mason
and
dixons
line
and
the
friends
of
the
union
were
not
free
from
apprehension
on
the
point
this
however
was
soon
settled
definitely
and
on
the
right
side
south
of
the
line
noble
little
delaware
led
off
right
from
the
first
maryland
was
made
to
seem
against
the
union
our
soldiers
were
assaulted
bridges
were
burned
and
railroads
torn
up
within
her
limits
and
we
were
many
days
at
one
time
without
the
ability
to
bring
a
single
regiment
over
her
soil
to
the
capital
now
her
bridges
and
railroads
are
repaired
and
open
to
the
government
she
already
gives
seven
regiments
to
the
cause
of
the
union
and
none
to
the
enemy
and
her
people
at
a
regular
election
have
sustained
the
union
by
a
larger
majority
and
a
larger
aggregate
vote
than
they
ever
before
gave
to
any
candidate
or
any
question
kentucky
too
for
some
time
in
doubt
is
now
decidedly
and
i
think
unchangeably
ranged
on
the
side
of
the
union
missouri
is
comparatively
quiet
and
i
believe
can
not
again
be
overrun
by
the
insurrectionists
these
three
states
of
maryland
kentucky
and
missouri
neither
of
which
would
promise
a
single
soldier
at
first
have
now
an
aggregate
of
not
less
than
in
the
field
for
the
union
while
of
their
citizens
certainly
not
more
than
a
third
of
that
number
and
they
of
doubtful
whereabouts
and
doubtful
existence
are
in
arms
against
us
after
a
somewhat
bloody
struggle
of
months
winter
closes
on
the
union
people
of
western
virginia
leaving
them
masters
of
their
own
country
an
insurgent
force
of
about
for
months
dominating
the
narrow
peninsular
region
constituting
the
counties
of
accomac
and
northampton
and
known
as
eastern
shore
of
virginia
together
with
some
contiguous
parts
of
maryland
have
laid
down
their
arms
and
the
people
there
have
renewed
their
allegiance
to
and
accepted
the
protection
of
the
old
flag
this
leaves
no
armed
insurrectionist
north
of
the
potomac
or
east
of
the
chesapeake
also
we
have
obtained
a
footing
at
each
of
the
isolated
points
on
the
southern
coast
of
hatteras
port
royal
tybee
island
near
savannah
and
ship
island
and
we
likewise
have
some
general
accounts
of
popular
movements
in
behalf
of
the
union
in
north
carolina
and
tennessee
these
things
demonstrate
that
the
cause
of
the
union
is
advancing
steadily
and
certainly
southward
since
your
last
adjournment
lieutenantgeneral
scott
has
retired
from
the
head
of
the
army
during
his
long
life
the
nation
has
not
been
unmindful
of
his
merit
yet
on
calling
to
mind
how
faithfully
ably
and
brilliantly
he
has
served
the
country
from
a
time
far
back
in
our
history
when
few
of
the
now
living
had
been
born
and
thenceforward
continually
i
can
not
but
think
we
are
still
his
debtors
i
submit
therefore
for
your
consideration
what
further
mark
of
recognition
is
due
to
him
and
to
ourselves
as
a
grateful
people
with
the
retirement
of
general
scott
came
the
executive
duty
of
appointing
in
his
stead
a
general
in
chief
of
the
army
it
is
a
fortunate
circumstance
that
neither
in
council
nor
country
was
there
so
far
as
i
know
any
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
proper
person
to
be
selected
the
retiring
chief
repeatedly
expressed
his
judgment
in
favor
of
general
mcclellan
for
the
position
and
in
this
the
nation
seemed
to
give
a
unanimous
concurrence
the
designation
of
general
mcclellan
is
therefore
in
considerable
degree
the
selection
of
the
country
as
well
as
of
the
executive
and
hence
there
is
better
reason
to
hope
there
will
be
given
him
the
confidence
and
cordial
support
thus
by
fair
implication
promised
and
without
which
he
can
not
with
so
full
efficiency
serve
the
country
it
has
been
said
that
one
bad
general
is
better
than
two
good
ones
and
the
saying
is
true
if
taken
to
mean
no
more
than
that
an
army
is
better
directed
by
a
single
mind
though
inferior
than
by
two
superior
ones
at
variance
and
crosspurposes
with
each
other
and
the
same
is
true
in
all
joint
operations
wherein
those
engaged
can
have
none
but
a
common
end
in
view
and
can
differ
only
as
to
the
choice
of
means
in
a
storm
at
sea
no
one
on
board
can
wish
the
ship
to
sink
and
yet
not
unfrequently
all
go
down
together
because
too
many
will
direct
and
no
single
mind
can
be
allowed
to
control
it
continues
to
develop
that
the
insurrection
is
largely
if
not
exclusively
a
war
upon
the
first
principle
of
popular
governmentthe
rights
of
the
people
conclusive
evidence
of
this
is
found
in
the
most
grave
and
maturely
considered
public
documents
as
well
as
in
the
general
tone
of
the
insurgents
in
those
documents
we
find
the
abridgment
of
the
existing
right
of
suffrage
and
the
denial
to
the
people
of
all
right
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
public
officers
except
the
legislative
boldly
advocated
with
labored
arguments
to
prove
that
large
control
of
the
people
in
government
is
the
source
of
all
political
evil
monarchy
itself
is
sometimes
hinted
at
as
a
possible
refuge
from
the
power
of
the
people
in
my
present
position
i
could
scarcely
be
justified
were
i
to
omit
raising
a
warning
voice
against
this
approach
of
returning
despotism
it
is
not
needed
nor
fitting
here
that
a
general
argument
should
be
made
in
favor
of
popular
institutions
but
there
is
one
point
with
its
connections
not
so
hackneyed
as
most
others
to
which
i
ask
a
brief
attention
it
is
the
effort
to
place
capital
on
an
equal
footing
with
if
not
above
labor
in
the
structure
of
government
it
is
assumed
that
labor
is
available
only
in
connection
with
capital
that
nobody
labors
unless
somebody
else
owning
capital
somehow
by
the
use
of
it
induces
him
to
labor
this
assumed
it
is
next
considered
whether
it
is
best
that
capital
shall
hire
laborers
and
thus
induce
them
to
work
by
their
own
consent
or
buy
them
and
drive
them
to
it
without
their
consent
having
proceeded
so
far
it
is
naturally
concluded
that
all
laborers
are
either
hired
laborers
or
what
we
call
slaves
and
further
it
is
assumed
that
whoever
is
once
a
hired
laborer
is
fixed
in
that
condition
for
life
now
there
is
no
such
relation
between
capital
and
labor
as
assumed
nor
is
there
any
such
thing
as
a
free
man
being
fixed
for
life
in
the
condition
of
a
hired
laborer
both
these
assumptions
are
false
and
all
inferences
from
them
are
groundless
labor
is
prior
to
and
independent
of
capital
capital
is
only
the
fruit
of
labor
and
could
never
have
existed
if
labor
had
not
first
existed
labor
is
the
superior
of
capital
and
deserves
much
the
higher
consideration
capital
has
its
rights
which
are
as
worthy
of
protection
as
any
other
rights
nor
is
it
denied
that
there
is
and
probably
always
will
be
a
relation
between
labor
and
capital
producing
mutual
benefits
the
error
is
in
assuming
that
the
whole
labor
of
community
exists
within
that
relation
a
few
men
own
capital
and
that
few
avoid
labor
themselves
and
with
their
capital
hire
or
buy
another
few
to
labor
for
them
a
large
majority
belong
to
neither
classneither
work
for
others
nor
have
others
working
for
them
in
most
of
the
southern
states
a
majority
of
the
whole
people
of
all
colors
are
neither
slaves
nor
masters
while
in
the
northern
a
large
majority
are
neither
hirers
nor
hired
men
with
their
familieswives
sons
and
daughterswork
for
themselves
on
their
farms
in
their
houses
and
in
their
shops
taking
the
whole
product
to
themselves
and
asking
no
favors
of
capital
on
the
one
hand
nor
of
hired
laborers
or
slaves
on
the
other
it
is
not
forgotten
that
a
considerable
number
of
persons
mingle
their
own
labor
with
capital
that
is
they
labor
with
their
own
hands
and
also
buy
or
hire
others
to
labor
for
them
but
this
is
only
a
mixed
and
not
a
distinct
class
no
principle
stated
is
disturbed
by
the
existence
of
this
mixed
class
again
as
has
already
been
said
there
is
not
of
necessity
any
such
thing
as
the
free
hired
laborer
being
fixed
to
that
condition
for
life
many
independent
men
everywhere
in
these
states
a
few
years
back
in
their
lives
were
hired
laborers
the
prudent
penniless
beginner
in
the
world
labors
for
wages
awhile
saves
a
surplus
with
which
to
buy
tools
or
land
for
himself
then
labors
on
his
own
account
another
while
and
at
length
hires
another
new
beginner
to
help
him
this
is
the
just
and
generous
and
prosperous
system
which
opens
the
way
to
all
gives
hope
to
all
and
consequent
energy
and
progress
and
improvement
of
condition
to
all
no
men
living
are
more
worthy
to
be
trusted
than
those
who
toil
up
from
poverty
none
less
inclined
to
take
or
touch
aught
which
they
have
not
honestly
earned
let
them
beware
of
surrendering
a
political
power
which
they
already
possess
and
which
if
surrendered
will
surely
be
used
to
close
the
door
of
advancement
against
such
as
they
and
to
fix
new
disabilities
and
burdens
upon
them
till
all
of
liberty
shall
be
lost
from
the
first
taking
of
our
national
census
to
the
last
are
seventy
years
and
we
find
our
population
at
the
end
of
the
period
eight
times
as
great
as
it
was
at
the
beginning
the
increase
of
those
other
things
which
men
deem
desirable
has
been
even
greater
we
thus
have
at
one
view
what
the
popular
principle
applied
to
government
through
the

machinery
of
the
states
and
the
union
has
produced
in
a
given
time
and
also
what
if
firmly
maintained
it
promises
for
the
future
there
are
already
among
us
those
who
if
the
union
be
preserved
will
live
to
see
it
contain
the
struggle
of
today
is
not
altogether
for
today
it
is
for
a
vast
future
also
with
a
reliance
on
providence
all
the
more
firm
and
earnest
let
us
proceed
in
the
great
task
which
events
have
devolved
upon
us
